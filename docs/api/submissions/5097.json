Summer has an autoimmune disease and her mom isn\u2019t in the picture. Her dad spoils her rotten because of this. \n\nIf dinner\u2019s already done but Summer wants something else, he orders it for her because \u201cshe gets cravings\u201d. She doesn\u2019t do any chores around the house and I\u2019m not allowed to ask her for help with anything. If she\u2019s being a brat he excuses it because \u201cher medicines cause mood swings\u201d and she can demand all of his attention whenever she wants. \n\nSummer goes to one of those year round schools. So instead of a 3 month summer break, they get like a month in the summer and they split the other 2 months up throughout the rest of the year. Because of this, she has a 4 week winter break. \n\nSummer was supposed to spend the first week of winter break on vacation with her friend and her mom. It was okay at first. I enjoyed spending time with my fianc\u00e9 without her interrupting us every 10 minutes but she still called when she woke up, before she went to bed, and every few hours in between. She constantly complained that she missed him (this was the first time she\u2019s been away from him since her mom left). \n\nOn day 4, we got a call from her friend\u2019s mom. Summer wasn\u2019t feeling well and wanted to go home. I answered the phone the first time and I asked the mom if she had a fever, was throwing up, or was actually sick. The mom said no fever or vomiting but she\u2019s tired and says she wants to go home. I told her to tell Summer to stick it out and call us if she actually gets sick. \n\nSummer decided to call her dad, say she didn\u2019t feel good, and that I said she couldn\u2019t come home. He didn\u2019t even give me a chance to explain myself before kicking me out of the house and starting the 4 hour drive to the friend\u2019s cabin. When they got home, he told me he needs to rethink our relationship. I told him summer is manipulating him now like she always does and listed examples of her using her illness to get what she wants with her dad. He told me not to contact him for the next few weeks while he thinks about if he really wants to marry me and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. \n\nAm I the asshole for saying summer is manipulative?", "created_utc": 1671429588, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpjlaz/aita_for_telling_my_fianc\u00e9_that_his_daughter_is/", "score": 5445, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she wanted to come home because she wanted to sleep in her own bed - that is valid.\n\nAlso, autoimmune diseases can be debilitating and there's not enough info here to know if she is actually just being a brat or if you are being ableist (but based on the rest of your post, I'm going with the latter).\n\nIt's wild that you feel entitled to gatekeep when someone else's child is allowed to come back to THEIR home.\n\nYou are not looking like step-parent material. I think rethinking this marriage will be in the best interest of everyone involved.\n\nEDIT: (Because people make excuses like this woman didn't know what she signed up for) Are y'all on like 90 day fiance or something? Cause I'm confused how you could have been together more than 90 days and not realized this was not gonna work out with how much vitriol you have for his daughter.", "YTA are you modeling your approach to being a step mother from disney?", "YTA. I notice you don't say what her actual disease is, and only describe symptoms as supposed manipulations. If your version were too be accepted, this young woman has an autoimmune disorder with no real symptoms, but coincidentally she makes up symptoms just to be manipulative. That's not credible.\n\nThat withholding information is a pattern we are used to seeing when you know if you give full info, nobody will be on your side. \n\nIn any case, she's happy with the parenting situation, dad is happy with the situation with her. \nOnly you aren't happy with how this child is being parented, and you don't get a say. Now Dad isn't happy with you, and I don't think you have a fiance anymore.\n\nYou are 1000% the ahole on this situation. You should not marry this guy. This isn't a kid who will launch at age 18, she's going to launch slower, if at all. You don't want to be around for that.", "YTA.\n\nWhether or not she spoiled, it's not on you to d\u00e9cid\u00e9 if Summer can come home or not. You're not the parent and you didn't make that decision based on parenting or helping the kid, bu just because you didn't want her around.\n\nYou're dating \u00e0 man with \u00e0 kid and not mother around. You're not always going to be the center of his attention.\n\nYou need to grow up.", "YTA this is his daughter in his house, either suck it up until she\u2019s moved out or at college or ship out.  \n\nWhy not compromise, live separately and schedule dates when you will be the centre of attention.  You will not win trying to get between a parent and their child.", "YTA. I've had an autoimmune disease and I can tell you that it was absolutely miserable. The medicine made me nauseous at even the slightest whiff of most foods and I couldn't get out of bed due to how much my head hurt and how tired I felt. Summer having an appetite at all is a good thing.", "YTA, both for calling her manipulative and for telling Summer for stick it out when she\u2019s sick.  Clearly, you prefer that this kid not be around, \u201cI enjoyed spending time with my fianc\u00e9 without her interrupting us\u2026\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a dad.  They\u2019re a package deal.  You guys are not compatible.  And honestly, you\u2019re actions and attitude are unforgivable", "YTA. Summer's mom left, she has an autoimmune disease, and it was her first time away from her father. Instead of showing any empathy you were annoyed she called him, and took it on yourself to parent her, and called her manipulative. She will always come first for him. I'd dump you too.", "YTA. Your ex is a single father. His child takes priority over you. You do not get to tell his daughter that she can\u2019t come home.", "YTA - it actually sounds quite dangerous for you to be around your fianc\u00e9\u2019s child. Have you educated yourself on autoimmune disorders? Do you realize the seriousness of it? Additionally, Summer doesn\u2019t need a reason to come back to her home. If you decided visit your friend for a week, wouldn\u2019t you be able to change your mind a few days in? Someone above compared you to a Disney villain. I wholeheartedly agree.", "Are you kidding me? YTA. There could be 100 reasons that any kid on her first stay away from a parent would want to come home even if she isn\u2019t vomiting/feverish. You always go get the kid, no questions asked. Not your call and not the time or place to claim \u201cmanipulation.\u201d", "YTA - this was not the time to pick this battle, he has made it clear that he doesn\u2019t want you to parent her. So then you tell her to stick it out over the phone without telling her dad she wanted to come home. Eesh not a good look. It\u2019s just not your place. He\u2019s supposed to choose her over you. Maybe you aren\u2019t cut out to be a step parent.", "YTA. I have a rule with my son that if he doesn't feel safe/ happy wherever he is,he calls. Doesn't have to give the right reason,he calls,we go get him and he's now 17. Was absolutely not your call to decide she couldn't come home. If her actual parent wants to go and get her that is his choice.", "YTA. Summer may be a spoilt and have to grow up at some point, but denying a child the ability to go home to their parent, where they feel safe (sick or not) is an asshole move.", "INFO I\u2019m dying to know how long you\u2019ve been with your fianc\u00e9", "YTA \n\nDon\u2019t date people with children!", "YTA. If a kid is calling and asking to come home, you let them come home. You don't tell them to \"stick it out\". And regardless, that wasn't your call to make.", "YTA, she wanted to come home, her reason is irrelevant and it's 100% not your place to decide whether she should stick it out or not. I think it's ironic that you want call her manipulative when you clearly tried to manipulate this situation to suite your own wants.. the correct thing  you should've done was let her dad handle it immediately.\n\nChildren should not be ignored in these situations, something legitimately bad could've been happening over there and her excuse of not feeling well may have been the only 'safe' way to get out of there. Did you consider that at all? No, because you do not have this girl's best interests at heart, let the people who do make these decisions.", "YTA for several reasons, but mostly for not realizing how this was going to play out. I think it\u2019s quite possible that you were right about Summer being manipulative, but that\u2019s a battle you are clearly never going to win. I can see that just from reading what you wrote, so it\u2019s surprising that you didn\u2019t realize it. \n\nMoreover, you\u2019re not ready to be a step-parent and I\u2019m not sure you ever will be. While your fianc\u00e9 is rethinking this relationship, so should you.", "YTA\n\nGood for him for having healthy boundaries and  going low contact with you while he reassesses this relationship. \n\nComplaining that she kept texting him while away from home for the first time? Unilaterally deciding not to let her come home or even tell her actual parent? YIKES. \n\nIs she manipulative? Maybe. Most teenagers are, chronic illness or not. But you are obviously seething with jealousy because of his child's need for her father's love and attention. Not a good forecast for marrying into his family.", "YTA.  Let me see...fiance is, 40ish, you're what ..25?", "[deleted]", "Holy shit 100% YTA. Don't date someone with kids if you don't want to deal with kids.", "YTA. You overstepped big time .", "YTA\n\nBut take this as an oportunity to break out the relationship and PLEASE never date single parents... you are EVIL STEPMOM material and no children deserve to have that in their lives...", "YTA.  She is his daughter, and her mom is not in the picture.  Of COURSE she is going to be closely bonded to her father and he obviously adores her and puts her FIRST, as any parent should!\n\nShe has an autoimmune disorder....how dare YOU accuse her of faking her illness or of manipulating him?!  She is a 15 yr old child who needs her father and vice versa!  You are obviously jealous of the bond they have and you view her as an intrusion and threat into the time and attention with him that you want all to yourself!\n\nI hope he decides to walk away and not look back because you will not be a supportive partner for him, and you will be a horrible step parent to this child.  She deserves someone who will love her along with loving him.  You aren't up for either task.", "YTA\n\nYou had no right to make that choice. It wasn't your place to decide if and when *his* child gets to come home. You are a huge asshole for this, and you probably fucked your relationship.\n\nYou may be correct that Summer is spoiled, that she takes advantage of her dad, that she uses her disease to get what she wants... but! You aren't her parent! You don't make decisions about her healthcare.\n\nNot to mention that, this time, you can be wrong. A kid doesn't make up a sickness just to come home.  It's also horrible to impose on someone else (the friend's mother)to take care of a sick child.", "[removed]", "Why date a man with a child if you see his child as an interference in the relationship. YTA", "YTA. It doesn't matter that she wasn't displaying her uncomfort in ways like throwing up or having a fever. When she expresses that she isn't feeling well, you don't risk things like this with a person that has a medical history. And it wasn't your call to make. You have not yet become a step-mother and it already seems that you can't wait to fill in the role of the evil step-mum.\n\nCome on, she's 15. If she is manipulating her father, that's HER father and he is old enough to decide on how he wants to deal with it and the relevant consequences.", "You\u2019re not ready to be married to someone with a kid. YTA", "Oooof. \n\n1You clearly do not have a chronic illness. You have no clue how that poor girl is feeling. Just because someone looks fine and \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a fever\u201d doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t experiencing a flare up of their symptoms. \n\n2. Summer is 15. She wanted to go home. She doesn\u2019t need a reason to want to return to *her* home.\n\nYTA. Big time. Luckily, your fianc\u00e9 seems to have his priorities straight.", "YTA. Stop throwing fits of jealous rage in response to any attention summer receives from her father. Because he\u2019s a good father, he will never choose you over his daughter. That you see yourself in competition w/a fifteen year old child. Shame on you.", "YTA. She has an auto immune disease, her medication causes moodswings as a side effect, this is the first time she's been away from someone she's very close to. You are not her parent and have not earned that spot yet, possible never will(as is the case with this situation). She is being a teenager who is comfortable and safe with her father. Its not manipulation, at least not what you described.", "YTA for manipulating the situation to try to bypass the father and not inform him of her wanting to come home.", "You know what? YTA. \n\nYou brought it up at the wrong time and didn't seem to care about Summer's crisis. It's only natural that her dad doesn't want to care about you in return. I hope you enjoy being single.", "YTA. For trying to put yourself in between father and daughter. You actually sound envious of her. When you go into a relationship with someone that has kids, they should always come first. You have to accept that or find someone single. He sounds like a great father, possibly not so much a partner. Kids are kids forever, partners may come and go. Sounds like you need to go.", "YTA. Sounds like you\u2019re just jealous that she gets special treatment from her dad and you didn\u2019t like she was taking so much of his attention away from you. If you\u2019re gonna be marrying into the family, she\u2019s always going to be a part of the family and you can\u2019t ever get rid of her, but you just dismissed her first when she called you when she was unwell. Sure she may be spoiled rotten, but you could have let her come home first and then decide again if she was telling the truth", "YTA It's time to call off the wedding, and the entire relationship. If he's not going to do it, then you need to. You absolutely are not ready to be a stepparent/parent. At least not now. \n\nPlease remain childless, and don't date anyone with children, until you can reflect back on this and realize what an asshole you were.", "Eh...YTA. You have valid points, and you're probably right, but it wasn't your place to dictate if/when Summer came home. That was something her dad should have decided. If it's as bad as you say maybe you should also be looking at this relationship with a critical eye.", "Are you effing kidding me?!? Yes YTA!!!\n\nYou\u2019re intimidated and jealous of her and it is very clear. \n\nYou will not win, he will always choose her, as he should, and if you can\u2019t get on board with that then you need to leave because step mothers like you cause serious lifelong trauma.", "YTA. You obviously view Summer as a nuisance. You downplay her disease, her feelings, and her character. Also what do you mean \u201cdemands attention\u201d she\u2019s a child and you view her as competition. She may be the child but you\u2019re the only immature one.", "Obviously YTA but the issue here is that I don\u2019t think you and him will last. One because he has a daughter and he has a #1 but you want to be #1 and that\u2019s undoable with a single parent. Parents SHOULD put their kids first. You need a single person with no child. See, he\u2019s alone in this so he has to be there for her or else who will??? Nobody. You\u2019re not going to last simply because you don\u2019t want to share which means you need someone who isn\u2019t a parent. Some ppl can do it and some can\u2019t and that\u2019s ok there\u2019s a lot more ppl out there.", "YTA", "The kid probably is pulling strings as a 15 year old is likely to do because they are learning how to deal with life. You however are an adult. What's your excuse for being manipulative?  YTA.", "YTA", "YTA you have no right to tell someone else's 15 year old daughter that they can't come home, for any reason, even if they're your soon-to-be-stepdaughter. And saying that you don't seem all that ready to be a stepmom. You sound very critical of her. Maybe you have some good points but from what you've said her you've never actually had a \\[gentle, understanding\\] conversation with your fiance, and you picked the worst time to try and flex your \"authority\". Why would a dad want to be with someone who views their child as a manipulative annoyance?", "Yta. She's a sick kid who wants to be home. Wtf is wrong with you.", "Major YTA for not picking her up from a friends place if she wasn\u2019t feeling it after several days. If somethings going from when staying at someone else\u2019s place you need to give them an escape option no questions asked. She could have been being pressured into doing things she felt were inappropriate. Not the hill to make your stand on AT ALL.\n\nPotentially the daughter may be manipulative however this topic will be fraught with danger to raise even in an appropriate way. Pull your head in, apologise and wait.", "YTA. You are not her parent. When she called wanting to come home only 2 responses were proper. To pass the message on to her dad asap or to tell her to call her father direct so he can get her home. That's it. It's highly probable that you are correct. That she is manipulating her dad and your actions played right into her hands. Don't count on this relationship continuing.", "YTA for wanting a father to put his child second to you.", "Yta and that\u2019s exactly what you get! You are not this girls mother or stepmom you are just her fathers fianc\u00e9e( maybe not even that now) you had no right to tell her to stick it out just because you enjoyed the alone time with your fianc\u00e9.", "Sorry, are you asking whether you\u2019re the AH for telling a girl who already had a whole life and routine with her dad well before they even knew you existed she couldn\u2019t come back to HER home because YOU said so? Who tf are you to decide when she gets to come to HER home? \n\nThank goodness her dad has enough sense to see the red flags now before he has to go through the hassle of divorcing you down the road. YTA and also hopefully single again soon.", "YTA.\n\nNo child or person needs a reason to want to come home. It's *home*. Kids that are treated as if their made of glass do tend to have some traits that are less than desirable, but that's something either you let the parent deal with, or not at all. It's not up to you. \n\nYou sounds so damn resentful. She probably has separation anxiety. She probably has other issues too, but it sounds like you have no *concern* or *care* for this child. It's just inconvenience and disdain.\n\nHow did you think telling a father his daughter is manipulating him was going to be taken? Especially during a confrontation? \n\nDo what I do, don't date people with kids.", "YTA, you don't have the compassion, understanding or mentality to be mother, let alone a step parent, to any child.

Go off a bridge without a rope, and call us if you actually go splat. Do you know what an autoimmune disease is, you heartless beast.", "YTA\n\nOh wow! Just wow!\n\nAre you sure an adult? You sound like a bitter, self-centered teenager.", "Goodness me YTA on this one. If, and it\u2019s a really big if, your ex fianc\u00e9 decides to have you back you need to do better for this child. Her illness aside, please please read up about childhood attachment, your exes daughter is testing her attachment to her dad with these requests because she feels insecure after her mum left. This is a sort of emotional regression to an earlier childhood stage in a sense, and is a normal and healthy behaviour in this situation. In fact you missed an opportunity to help her build trust with you as a caregiver when you prioritised yourself. \n\nBy making her feel secure and cared for like her dad does you would actually be helping her grow up and feel secure enough to go out into the world on her own, which would benefit you in the long term (since you seem to need an incentive to be kind).

Luckily it sounds like your bf can see it. Summer is his daughter, she has a disease, she comes first second and third. Just like any child would. It isn't up to you to raise her. It's none of your business if he spoils her. It isn't your concern if she does chores or not. What's it to you what someone else's child eats anyway? Is your problem jealousy or are you just a control freak? \n\nIf you want a child to raise and boss around, have one. She is not your daughter, you are definitely not her mother. You're not her parent. You're not her mentor. She does not need your idea of \"dicipline\" nor advice. Back off, mind your own business, and keep your nose out of it before your bf takes a look at all those red flags you're waving around and sends you packing permanently.", "YTA on this one  but  you are never going to win any battles with this relationship.   She may be spoilt  but she will always be his priority.  It's possible  she is  a little  jealous  that you have come into the picture and are taking up some his time  .  You can either step back  and if he agrees to see you still , just live in your own place and wait for him to contact you to spend time with him  when he can fit you in or move on .  You have to consider  due to her illness  she won't be turning 18  and moving out , she might always be  living there, can you cope  with always being  second .", "YTA.  I don't wish an autoimmune disease on anyone.  BUT if you do happened to get one, I hope you get called a brat and told to \"stick it out\" when you are in debilitating pain.  \n\nThe only manipulative person in this whole scenario was you, trying to create a rift between father and daughter because you liked your fiancee better without a daughter present.", "YTA. You said this was the first time she'd been away from her dad. She was definitely sick, she was *homesick*. \n\nI get it. She probably *is* manipulating her dad. She probably *is* making you miserable. *But she's part of the package that comes with your fianc\u00e9*. You talk about how relaxed you were, but your fianc\u00e9 has probably been anxious. And then you get the kind of phone call he would worry about (especially with her ongoing health issues) *and you ignored it because you felt better when she wasn't there*. You've just shown him you have no empathy or compassion for his daughter *or for him*.\n\nShe isn't just going to vanish when she turns 18. She will always be his little girl. *She will always be part of the dynamic of your relationship with her father*. Even if he does take you back, you need to think *very seriously* if this is what you want. Do you love your fianc\u00e9 enough to live with the familial dynamic that he has accepted as normal, without resenting and blaming his daughter for that dynamic and how it makes you feel?", "YTA but some kids with chronic illness become spoiled brats from constantly being the center of everything.  This probably isn\u2019t the right relationship for either one of you. The daughter will always be the center of everything and everyone else will be last.", "INFO: why do you want to marry this man, given that you will always be second?", "Summer is a spoiled child who does not know better because this is how she was raised by your fiancee. You should challenge him on that. YTA however for thinking you have a say in whether he will know about and do something about his daughter allegedly being sick. That is not your place, she is his child.", "YTA\nMaybe the daughter is manipulating her dad. Maybe she needs some therapy because she's not behaving like a 15y old. But you don't have any right to refuse her to come home. No wonder your partner is questioning the whole relationship.", "Poor husband", "Wow. You realize the kid comes with the guy, right? And that kids come first to any good parent? Major AH. At least dad has his priorities straight.", "Man and his daughter come as a package, if you can't cope with daughter maybe it's time to walk away.", "NAH\n\nHe's taking time to re-think the relationship, so should you. Do not expect things to change after marriage, you'd be a fool to hope for that. They will always be a package deal. She will come first before you (as the minor child should) whether it's awful parenting or not. And is this the kind of husband/father you'd like to have more kids with?  \n\nAs of now, it's not a matter of judging if he's parenting right, but if this is the kind of man you'd like to have a LT relationship with.\n\nTbf autoimmune diseases vary widely from almost living normally to scary progression. If it's on the milder side, he's doing the kid no favors. I know of a divorced dad whose daughter seems to have some learning disability. We all suspect some kind of autism, but both parents are in denial to have her tested and have babied her to death ever since a tot and say she's just learning at her own pace. We are talking of a 15yr old who carries on like a 10yr old. Has problems making friends and with schoolwork, their solution if it becomes too bad is to switch schools. Suddenly gets \"sick\" if her dad's attention isn't on her/away from home, cries on the phone wanting to go home when at her mom's, then cries on the phone wanting to go home because she misses her mom when at her dad's... Etc etc long list of problematic behavior... *Now* you can hear the dad complain at times why can't the daughter act more her age, can't do certain tasks, comments about how she can't catch up with lessons, and other stuff. All I can do is look at him with furrowed brows, do a mental forehead slap and rant in my head, \"Why do you think we were all urging you to act on it years ago, for funsies?\"\n\nHowever, if your OP question was: were you an AH for deciding she shouldn't come home? Yes.", "NTA. Do not go back into that situation. That little girl has her dad all wrapped up and there is ZERO you can do about it.", "**NTA**  It was a futile attempt though.   If you were bothered by Summer's manipulation, that should have been raised in couples/pre-marital counseling, not in the midst of a Summer created crisis.", "NTA, and I have a ton of sympathy for you.

Maybe it\u2019s a blessing in disguise if he breaks it off.", "Dump him, his daughter is using her illness to get what she wants and it will only get worse eith time.

You'll always come in second to princess.", "YTA for a few reasons, but as someone who has struggled with health issues since I was 9 I'd like to offer some insight on that aspect of things. You do not know how Summer is feeling. Some of her symptoms may be visible, but I'd wager that plenty of them are not. 9/10 times that I have a bad health day, the only \"visible\" symptom is me vocalizing about it.\n\nDoes that make it easier for me to fake a bad day? Technically yes! And I will not deny that I did do that as a child. But for me, it was never \"oh hey I just don't want to go to school today\". Rather it was always something at school/home that was causing a problem, and I didn't know how to deal with that.\n\nIn this case, Summer seemed to make it clear that she really missed her dad, and you specified that this is the first time she's gone without him for this long. Did it occur to you that she might have ended up not being ready to spend a whole week away from home? For me, stress/anxiety make my health problems worse, and I've met people with all varieties of health problems who have experienced the same thing.\n\nI don't know the circumstances of her mother's absence, but that likely plays a heavy role in her dependence on her father. Honestly, I'm not sure I would have been comfortable at 15 spending a whole week away from my family, but I do have an anxiety disorder, so I can't say what's considered \"normal\".\n\nAnyway, I don't know how Summer's health compares to my own (I'm not personally familiar/don't have experience with autoimmune issues), but I want to make note of two last (health) things: People who deal with any sort of long-term health issues often develop a \"sixth sense\" in regards to their health. I can't always predict my migraines, but sometimes I just KNOW that one is coming, even if I can't point out what specifically is giving me that feeling. It's possible Summer was feeling Mildly Not Good but could tell that things were going to get worse.\n\nAdditionally, there is quite a lot that could be said about prevention/treatment of symptoms, but to summarize: Summer's father has more experience helping her with her health than her friend or the friend's mother (or you, really). At her age, I was able to understand what I could do for my health, but it wasn't something I enjoyed having to do outside of my home unless necessary. It's also easier to take care of myself at home, because I already have everything I need and I know where it is.\n\nFinally, not even in regards to health, but just parenting in general: if you have a child, and they ask you to pick them up, you do your best to do that. My father was never the best parent, and there were times he assumed I was faking and handled it horribly, but he made it clear that he would always pick me up from a friend's place if I needed it. Didn't matter if I had a migraine or was just uncomfortable for some other reason. He wanted me to know that he was there for me, and it worked. I was never in a situation where I desperately needed my dad to pick me up (i.e. out partying and suddenly there's no sober person to drive me home), but I know that he wouldn't have hesitated. Idk, I'm rambling, point is trust and availability.\n\nThe second you got a call saying Summer wanted to come home, you should have immediately given the phone to your fiance, or at least involved him in the conversation.", "Damn, if you hate the kid so much, why are you with the dad? Sounds like he's a good father. He'll prove that once he ditches you. \n\nYTA", "YTA and the only person trying to manipulate here is you.

Her dad spoils her rotten because of this. \n\nIf dinner\u2019s already done but Summer wants something else, he orders it for her because \u201cshe gets cravings\u201d. She doesn\u2019t do any chores around the house and I\u2019m not allowed to ask her for help with anything. If she\u2019s being a brat he excuses it because \u201cher medicines cause mood swings\u201d and she can demand all of his attention whenever she wants. \n\nSummer goes to one of those year round schools. So instead of a 3 month summer break, they get like a month in the summer and they split the other 2 months up throughout the rest of the year. Because of this, she has a 4 week winter break. \n\nSummer was supposed to spend the first week of winter break on vacation with her friend and her mom. It was okay at first. I enjoyed spending time with my fianc\u00e9 without her interrupting us every 10 minutes but she still called when she woke up, before she went to bed, and every few hours in between. She constantly complained that she missed him (this was the first time she\u2019s been away from him since her mom left). \n\nOn day 4, we got a call from her friend\u2019s mom. Summer wasn\u2019t feeling well and wanted to go home. I answered the phone the first time and I asked the mom if she had a fever, was throwing up, or was actually sick. The mom said no fever or vomiting but she\u2019s tired and says she wants to go home. I told her to tell Summer to stick it out and call us if she actually gets sick. \n\nSummer decided to call her dad, say she didn\u2019t feel good, and that I said she couldn\u2019t come home. He didn\u2019t even give me a chance to explain myself before kicking me out of the house and starting the 4 hour drive to the friend\u2019s cabin. When they got home, he told me he needs to rethink our relationship. I told him summer is manipulating him now like she always does and listed examples of her using her illness to get what she wants with her dad. He told me not to contact him for the next few weeks while he thinks about if he really wants to marry me and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. \n\nAm I the asshole for saying summer is manipulative?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So, if the relationship will only work for you with that change, it's not going to work for you. You might be \"right\" about all of it, but it won't matter to a parent who's worried about a sick child, and until you see his child as your child, too (which would be the case if you married), this is not going to make sense for you.

Also, it's his house and her house, and you were absolutely out of line in saying she couldn't come home when she wanted to come home: it's her home. This would be true if she wasn't sick at all, and good for him for not accepting that. No parent should accept any decision that makes a child feel unwelcome in their own home. If she bothered you that much because you needed a vacation from her, you could have just taken a little vacation from them. Understand the reality of the situation earnestly: it's very likely permanent, and if that's a deal-breaker for you, it's probably best to separate now. I've been both the observer thinking the parent is way too lenient (and spoiling) of the sick child and the parent with the sick child. Until you have a sick child, it's very difficult to really understand the constant vulnerability. If you can find a way within yourself to learn to love her and with love help establish some boundaries that he can also accept for her long-term good, the marriage could work. But it's not going to be easy, and it can only work if you can also love her as your stepdaughter.

He should be caring for her in the scope of her ailment not completely doing 100% of everything and catering to whims because of it. It\u2019s teaching her to use her ailment as a crutch. It isn\u2019t empowering. She is able bodied. Her body may have limitations but I doubt she even knows what they are because she doesn\u2019t have to do anything.

Having an autoimmune disorder isn't an excuse to be spoiled, to not do any chores or work around the house, or to always be demanding attention.  You and your fianc\u00e9 need to have a conversation on what married life would look like.  Obviously his daughter will continue to remain a top priority.  But if you're always going to be taking a back seat to her all of the time and the expectation is that the daughter will always get her way, you'll do best to look elsewhere.

Like there's no scenario in which OP comes out looking good.", "OP might be under the assumption that wife > kids. Truthfully, even birth mothers can\u2019t claim that much of the time. As much as people love their spouses, in most families kids who are minors come first.

His mood swings made him feel like he wanted to actually hurt me so he ended up not taking it anymore. It was a terrible time.", "I hate steroids! I call them the devil\u2019s tictacs. I have three AI diseases and asthma. It is inevitable that I will have to take steroids at least once or twice a year. They cause insomnia for me, also weight gain, cravings, hot flashes, and irritability. Not to mention, the other meds I need to take to manage them. I can completely relate to the diseases making you feel like shit and so do the meds.", "Maleficent was actually always my favorite Disney villain. Partly because she turns into a dragon and I have always loved dragons. But animated Maleficent is very dark, very clever, very strong. \n\nI enjoyed the remake, because I feel like Jolie did a good job of keeping the dignity, cleverness, and strength of the character. It actually added to the original story instead of completely changing it.\n\nLike, for example, Cruella.... Which was a good enough movie on it's own, but... I mean call me crazy, but I'd rather not empathize with a woman who wants to skin puppies to make a coat....", "Yzma was my favorite Disney villain before Maleficent came out and then I couldn't pick. So I just say Yzma is my favorite animated one and Maleficent is my favorite live action one. \n\nI like your point about Jolie's depiction. I think that's also why this movie worked much better than many of its counterparts. It stuck true enough to the source material for it to be nostalgic but it gave us so much more background/world building and changed it enough to keep it fresh and prevent it from feeling like a recycle. \n\nI haven't seen Cruella yet - but yeah, I imagine it's pretty hard to create any kind of motivation behind that action that most humans are going to find valid lol", "that\u2019s also a solid point. it\u2019s really hard to tell how much OP is actually telling the truth unless we can get the other side of things", "Im so sorry this is the state of life. I too hate being the weak one. My partners are also mostly understanding. But i dont want pity either and the sheer frustration i feel sometimes is enough to use up my spoons for a while.   I understand the feelings and they are reasonable. Take heart in that.", "There\u2019s a bunch of step parents floating around this sub who parent about as well as OP, so you\u2019re likely getting wonky reactions from them.", "And this might be kinda cliche but does anyone who defends people like the mother ever take the time to imagine the situation while putting yourself in their shoes? Because I\u2019m pretty sure that if it was your kid and your fianc\u00e9 was calling your kid manipulative and saying that they couldn\u2019t come home to THEIR own house without asking their parent (which is you) you\u2019d be kicking them out too or maybe nothing to that extent but you definitely wouldn\u2019t be on their side.", "talk about \u201cspoiled\u201d and \u201cmanipulative\u201d lol, OP needs to grow up and isn\u2019t ready to be a stepmother.", "Your response reminded me of when I was 5 and going to sleep over at my cousin's house for the first time. Male cousin threatened to glue my hands to the inside of the door frame.\n\nI instantly started crying and wanted to go home. My mother welcomed me home and gave me a used-up tube of lipstick that she'd been saving as a reward for me to play with me.\n\nI'm horrified at the thought of a parent cruel to tell a child (even a teenager) that they have to stay somewhere they aren't wanted or don't feel safe.", "OP gives me the vibes of \n\n\"I'm not having kids solely for the reason that I would resent them for taking away my husband's time from me\" vibes. \n\nWhich if that's your thing - go off queen. But DON'T be dating men with children then.", "Exactly which makes it even more weird because if my sons mother was to die right now and I\u2019m his only parent, I\u2019m backing him on everything. 1000000%. And not everything as in times where he\u2019s wrong or may be in the wrong but for times like what\u2019s being described in the post I got his back for it all and imma kick my fianc\u00e9 to the curb.", "Yep, I'm 40 with 2 kids and whenever I need help, my mom is right there. Thankfully, stepdad has always been right there behind her, ready to help when needed, too.", "I\u2019m parenting through something like this right now. My kid gets tired taking a shower. I\u2019m not going to make him do a bunch of chores just to make some point about \u201cgrit.\u201d\n\nHe shows up to school, does all his work, has good grades, and has to do his therapies. To me, he\u2019s doing more than his fair share of work.\n\nIf he\u2019s able to unload half the dishwasher every day and have a good attitude about it, I count that as a big win.", "100% agree. My RA meds are working amazingly, but last Sunday, I performed in a 45 minute concert in which I was seated the entire time. I slept 12 hours and needed a massage the next day. I also took Tuesday off from work (I don\u2019t work Mondays).", "Villain backstories from the villain's perspective are so great because the reality is that almost everyone, even the worst people, are the heroes of the story in their own mind and likes to believe their actions are justified. Humanity is deeply flawed and its often the flaws that make it interesting.", "Generally at the teen years, kids WANT away time from their parents. If they\u2019re asking to come home early from something, there\u2019s a reason.", "My parents generation (boomers) had this mentality. New Partner over any kids", "Exactly this. My husband and I have a son together and we both agree our son comes first. I also have stepparents, and my mom and \u201cstep\u201ddad have always been clear their kids come first. If someone can\u2019t understand that, they have no business dating a single parent.", "Exactly, even if the daughter is manipulating him. He\u2019s ok with it. OP needs to read the room and realize that her bf wasn\u2019t trying to decipher if his daughter was spoiled or manipulated. He wanted her to feel secure in knowing her dad would always have her back and be there for her. And frankly. These \u201cconcerns\u201d of OP weren\u2019t even very worrisome. A kid without a medical issue could behave the same way and still grow up to be a completely well adjusted adult with no manipulative tendencies", "I knew I'd found a good doc when  just to get one thing handled'.

The fatigue though is waht us truly crippling.\n\nThe truth is there are plenty of people with AI diseases that should probably never live alone. I am one of those people.", "Or sometimes even without using medication to suppress the immune system, the immune system is so busy attacking the body it doesn't really protect against infections. So then you get to have the infection and the AI symptoms while the immune system gets the message that there is something it should be attacking. And then when the infection is fought off the immune system all geared up with nothing to fight so it returns to its favourite punching bag. Starting the whole vicious cycle all over again...", "I agree. \n\nThey still don't know what I have. Like 8 months ago my brain just swelled up and it still hasn't gone back to normal. Everything but autoimmune was ruled out within a week. They were thinking an unusual but not unheard of presentation of sarcoidosis but they're skeptical since they couldn't find any other evidence of it. I learned it could disappear and never recur as I researched it, and that the factors I match made it more likely.", "I'm betting the daughter does do 'chores' just not things evil step mom in waiting here thinks are chores. She hates the kid.", "My RA is basically invisible at this point, but 6 months ago I could barely walk.
