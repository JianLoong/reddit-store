Though, my daughter (17f) came back from studying, took it from the refrigerator whilst I wasn\u2019t there and had all of it in one go. The batches were quite small, though this is quite shocking as my daughter is hollow-cheeked to begin with. \n\nLater that evening when I found out I was in complete disbelief as it took me a while to get the batch and taste as I wanted it. Her brother (15m) was excited to try it too and was upset when it was gone.\n\nI called her down and told her that it was meant for everyone, she started apologising and said \u201cit was a true accident\u201d. \n\nI give her my apron, tell her to make it exactly like it tasted and she was shocked as she wasn\u2019t a great baker nor made cookies that tasted okay. \n\nI tell her she must do it and make the exact same batch as I did, she starts doing it and i check later to test the batch and it was nothing like mine. I tell her to remake it six times and she hasn\u2019t made one that was even good. She just throws her apron on the table and tells me that she doesn\u2019t even want to look at me as I am \u201cdismissive\u201d and \u201ccruel\u201d. \u201cYou don\u2019t think people can make mistakes, you know it all too well\u201d.

I agree with your daughter, that was kind of cruel of you.", "YTA\n\nYou made a small batch of cookies a child ate. \n\nInstead of coaching her to ask permission and then teaching her how to make cookies like you do, you've left her to \"fix\" this on her own and made her do it 6 times over. \n\nThis is emotional abuse tbh.\n\nYou need therapy.", "YTA - You didn\u2019t tell her there was a change in the routine and the batches were small.

You weren't being understanding at all. Your were being a vindictive, sanctimonious asshole. \n\nDid you even bother to guide her in the process or did you just chuck the recipe at her along with your apron? You missed out on a great teachable moment here. You could have shown her how much work and effort goes into making a batch but nope, you just decided to turn her loose. You owe her an apology more than she owes you one.", "YTA - Making her make 6 batches isn't reasonable and understanding given that she's not a good baker. \n\n  \nYes, it was a mistake and asking her to remake them makes sense. But YOU KNOW she's not a good baker and somehow expected her to flawlessly execute lavender cookies????", "YTA. \n\nIf you wanted to make her bake a batch to make up for it, I'd be ok with that.  I think its a fair punishment for what she did.  \n\nBut 6 times?  That is insane.  I'm not a baker, but will make stuff for parties.  one batch of cookies is more than enough work.  She would've learned her lesson.  You went WAY too far here.\n\nNow, I'm that being reddit, someone will call this abuse and call you all kinds of names.  I won't go that far.

She\u2019s remade it 6 times?! What the heck kind of secret sauce is in these lavender cookies that you have been fussing over that you apparently can\u2019t be bothered to share with her as she makes all these attempts?\n\nOn her part, it was an accident based on habits you\u2019ve instilled in your household. On your part, you seemingly HAVE been cruel and gone out of your way to shame her through baking.", "YTA.\n\n  \nSo, she is accustomed to you leaving leftovers for her to eat and as a result she eats the cookies thinking they are for her. You find out what she did, chastise her for doing something that up until this point has been ok, then proceed to force her to remake the cookies six times all the while berating her for not getting it right.   \nNot only are you the TA, but your behavior is bordering on abusive.", "YTA - 6 times is cruel.

And then, you cruelly punished her by making her do 6 batches of cookies.", "YTA.  OP, if I break a pottery candle at the store, the store does not require me to learn to hand throw pots and make candles to replace it.  You didn't label the cookies.  Maybe daughter should have realized that there were more than usual, but probably her brain went \"Yay, there's lots left over!\".  If she made six batches, (I couldn't tell from your description) then she's served her time, it's over and you need to apologize to her.  \n\nIf she made one batch, then still apologize and ASK if she could help you make another batch.  Whether she can or cannot, let it go, it's over.  Stuff happens.", "Whaaaaat? No. You think you were being reasonable here???\n\nFor starters, if up until now it was a norm for her to get the leftovers and you didn't specify that you hadn't eaten your portions, how could she have known? Even if what was left was more than the usual, when it's yummy, you don't stop to think, \"hey, is this batch more than the usual leftovers?\"\n\nSecond, you know she can't bake and still expected her to make a perfect batch. What is that even?? If you accidentally got a flat tire for driving over broken glass (honest mistake) and you wouldn't know how to change the tire, how would you feel if your partner forced you to change it anyways and let you struggle with it? And criticizing you instead of explaining how is done?\n\nSorry, OP, but clearly YTA.", "Yikes...YTA.  You seem borderline abusive here.  6 times!?!  You yourself admitted it was hard to do, and you're apparently a baker and your child is not, and you make no mention of helping or coaching her through it.  If this is how you treat your children when mistakes happen, expect to not be in their lives when they're adults.", "OP graduated Thanos' school of parenting it seems.", "I read: \u201cI made a mistake and left my cookies in the fridge. My daughter usually gets hers from the fridge. She did so again, and now I\u2019m mad she ate my cookies. I made her bake six batches. Now she hates cookies, baking and me.\u201d\n\nYes, YTA, ma\u2019am.", "YTA. Having her bake new cookies is reasonable. Making her try six times and not accepting any is not.", "YTA. You are cruel. How was she to know when all previous times the leftovers were for her? Forcing her to make them again when she\u2019s not as skilled a baker is horrible.", "YTA and abusive to boot. You deciding arbitrarily to choose to have cookies later than usual and then punishing her when she follows the established pattern, really sounds like setting her up more than anything. Can't wait for your post in a couple of years about how your daughter won't talk to you and you don't know why. This kind of stuff is why. (Take it from someone who came from an abusive home and doesn't speak to them anymore.) \n\nForcing her to make 6 batches! Wow. No one thinks that is reasonable and understanding and you know it.", "Oh my god, YTA. \nThat was a genuine mistake from your daughter, since taking them directly from the fridge is what she\u2019s used to. Why are you even complaining? It\u2019s not like she purposely ate them all. \n\nYou, on the other hand, should have told her you had other plans, or at least left a note. Why do you want to teach her a lesson for something YOU could have prevented? \n\nAnd you\u2019re even more of an AH for making her bake them six fucking times. For something you were responsible for. Jeez", "Yta have her remake cookies? Sure. Have her remake them *6* times with 0 instructions when you know she isn't a baker? Yta", "You have a system. Your daughter followed that system. You forgot and blamed her.\n\nYta.", "YTA. You clearly need to go to parenting classes and therapy multiple times a week for all your issues. Making them one time is one thing, but 6 times because your abusive aid so beyond wrong.", "YTA. This isn't Hell's Kitchen, lady... No need to get all Gordon Ramsey on her. \n \nShe was literally only going about her normal routine, and you didn't communicate with her that they were not leftovers.", "YTA.\n\nAsking her to remake them six times is not reasonable or understanding.\n\nShe usually can eat what you leave in the fridge. This time was different but she wasn\u2019t aware of it. It was an honest accident.\n\nWhat is learning lesson from this punishment?", "YTA, your poor daughter", "YTA, you are punishing her for an accident and escalating the situation. Forcing her to make new ones is a reasonable consequence, so everyone can still get to taste them, but you are not doing that. You need to teach her how to make the cookies and help her succeed if you wanted to do that. What you\u2019re doing is to force her to fail and embarrass her to punish her for her mistake", "Yes, YTA. Punishing her AT ALL for an honest mistake was unfair. You usually leave her cookies in the fridge, so she understandably thought they were hers. You should have labeled them. \n\nAlso, baking is an art. You cannot reasonably expect a novice to bake to the same standards as someone experienced. That's insanity.", "YTA. You're cruel and awful. SIX FUCKING TIMES?? You were not actually expecting her to make the cookies right, you werr just torturing her. And it is entirely your fault that you didn't tell her in the first place that they weren't leftovers and were not meant to be eaten. It is not her fault you can't communicate. She's not going to get magical visions once she opens the fridge, is she??", "YTA. You had an established pattern with your daughter that the cookies left in the fridge when she got home later were hers to take,  and failed to communicate that you hadn't yet taken your share. You also admit it was a small batch, so she essentially had no clue. She really did just make a mistake,  after you made the bigger one.\n\n As far as making her redo them, you admitted it took you some time and trial to get them ideal.  Rather than share that information (and possibly bond as a learning experience), you send her in to fly blind and make her keep trying. Above and beyond correction.\n\nAdmit your part in the miscommunication,  apologize to her, bake a new batch with her, and move on.", "YTA\n\nkiss goodbye to whatever mother/daughter relationship you had before this", "Are you being serious? Do you fancy yourself in judging a baking show? \n\nWhat kind of parent would force their daughter to do something which wasn't to their standard and then throw it in her face to do better? Did you throw it on the floor and stomped on them for good measure because that's exactly what you did to her verbally.\n\nIf she liked them that much, you should have passed on the recipe and coached her on how to make it so she can bake them when she wants.

And for an honest mistake that YOU caused by not communicating. How tf was she supposed to know that they were for everyone?

What? She thought they were her leftovers, like the ones that you usually put aside for her. YOU changed your routine without communicating that to her, so thats your fault.

It seems like a legitimate mistake that you could have easily prevented by, i don\u2019t know, giving her a heads up that those cookies are for everyone (since that\u2019s a deviation from the norm).

No. That was your mistake. Your daughter is not at fault in anyway. And you just rubbed salt into the wound by making her rebake cookies that you knew were not going to turn out.
