The 2nd employee getting involved is simply stirring the pot and should be ignored by OP.  \n\nOP doesn't mention getting management involved, but that's certainly a reasonable next step, so a good boss might have a chance  to address this.\n\nBut speaking as a fellow employer, I'm surprised by your statement  \"people of your coworker's age have a high level of deep-seeded disordered eating,\"\n\nThat's quite a sweeping generalization. That's ageism. That's the kind of misguided thinking that makes it brutally hard for laid-off people over 50 to find employment, particularly older women. And that should concern us all,  as we'll all be there some day. (And no, you won't somehow avoid that fate by being a magically cool old person that younger people instantly understand and love. )\n\nSo I hope you don't carry that attitude into the workplace, if you do manage one, because that kind of attitude could, indeed, lead to a hostile work environment.", "Yes, this.

Old enough that being formally taught manners/etiquette as a child was a thing.\n\nIt was drilled into me that it is never ok to comment on what any one is--or is not--eating (the only possible exception being a host quietly asking a guest if the food is not to their liking/ can they provide anything different; then not saying anything more if the guest says they are alright).

That her behavior did stop does change my perspective and I appreciate the correction.\n\nIn regards to my sweeping statements in regards to disordered eating, I do mean to point that out as a form of compassion to the woman. Toxic Diet Culture and generational food shaming are highly studied fields. It\u2019s criminal the hyper-focus that has been put on food and it was socially ingrained for decades - particularly in the 50s-80s. There\u2019s a ton of other issues in regards to food but the specific act of food shaming is a particularly prevalent one in people born between 1940 and 1970. It\u2019s not even malicious. It\u2019s ingrained.", "Were it \"only\" once I might agree. Repeated, unwelcome behavior becomes hostile very quickly, almost immediately.

I didn't realize you'd meant that comment as a way to be more compassionate to Kate.\n\nYou are right -- a multi-generational workplace requires a full understanding of some of the cultural forces that shaped each generation. Not as excuses for bad behavior, ,but so each generation understands that behavior they might consider off or rude might be culturally ingrained. The trick of course would be not using it as an excuse for racism, sexism, and the like. \n\nI do worry its a slippery slope from \"these attitudes were common in this time period\" to \"all people this age have racist, sexist, messed up behavior hard wired into them, and will never be woke like us.\" Which precludes the possibility that generations before us had any admirable traits.\n\nIt's not only unfair, it makes younger generations lose out on the good that older generations bring, too. Such as maturity, balance, even-headedness, compassion, and memories of a pre-digital world where human connections were paramount. I've made a real effort to bring on older staff and create mentorship opportunities with good results.", "Oh, absolutely . And in this case, OP asked and she immediately stopped.", "No, \"hostile work environment\" is a very specific term legally. It's not just being rude to someone.

Ask a Manager is such a great blog!", "Well, we don't know how that actually went down though, do we? Kate might have said to the 2nd colleague, whom she mistakenly trusted, \"I feel like the world's biggest idiot! I was worried about OP's eating habits, and she actually had to \"yell\" at me before I picked up on how uncomfortable I was making her. I tried to apologize,  but I was so embarrassed I didn't do a good job of it. Do you think I should apologize again?\"\n\nAll I know is, as an employer,  is that it's a mistake to immediately assume ill intent.\n\n98% of the time things are misunderstandings. I've learned it's always best to start with questions rather than assumptions. \n\n So I wouldn't leap to assume Kate is trying to hurt OP. Probably more like slipping into an inappropriate \"mom\" level of concern about a younger person. She might be a mom coming back to the workforce with kids OP's age, who needs a wake-up call.  It's a common issue, and definitely needs to be addressed. Kate shouldn't do it. But probably well intentioned.", "Yeah, I'm sure the \"Kate\"s of the world rarely intend to \"hurt\"; they just think they know \"better\". \n\nAnd the \"Kate\"s who engage in such behavior seem to rarely ever consider their comments & actions are unwelcome & unwanted, at best.\n\nAnd they are rarely seriously, genuinely repentant.", ">I did not shout or call her names, but I did not say it in the nicest way.

Trying to improve your diet as a new employee is incredibly presumptuous and condescending.\n\nIt's especially irritating, speaking as an autistic person (or even just someone with coworkers who think I'm their kids' age), when people come in and immediately assume a motherly or teacherly role in a professional context. No, often not malicious, or even conscious, but annoying for sure. \n\nYou firmly asked her to stop, she stopped, the end. Not your other coworker's business, really.

Not gossip to others, yell and swear and make a scene in the lunch room. \n\nHer response of getting others involved is immature.", "NTA. You were kind to take Kate aside to speak with her. Your friend is wrong. You have every right to eat your lunch without her comments. If you\u2019re HR is good, report her if she does it again.", "No; she\u2019s older; this is how she cares is bs. She\u2019s not your mother, aunt or grandparent. This coworker didn\u2019t want to admit she got a wrong story, and so tried to stick with; well you were in the wrong. \n\nShe is a grown woman and knows basic respect and decency and that harassing someone about their food is rude. Especially as she\u2019s a freaking vegetarian and probably gets offered meat regularly", "NTA, comments about what someone eats are never okay, I don\u2019t care if you eat a whole birthday cake for breakfast, it\u2019s still nta.", "NTA, you did nothing wrong", "NTA.  I turned 50  some 13 years ago, and I was adult enough then to know that you don't ever pester people about their food choices.  In fact, I achieved that level of adulthood by at least my early 20s.  I'm so sorry to hear that a 50-ish person hasn't grown up yet.", " NTA. People like this are why I don\u2019t eat at work. I had people actually ask me to my face if I had an eating disorder! I don\u2019t feel like explaining to my coworkers that my meds make me sick if I eat too early and I\u2019m also not hungry till I get home. It\u2019s none of their business", "NTA - you don\u2019t have to compromise on your boundaries to protect another person\u2019s fragile ego.  \n\nGosh I\u2019m so sick of people demanding that others keep the peace while they are being harassed. This is always the absolute sh*ttiest take, but (speaking as a former HR person) especially at work. \n\nShe was out of line, you asked her to stop. Maybe that was embarrassing for her, but that\u2019s for her to work through - it doesn\u2019t mean you did anything wrong.\n\nGood for you for saying something.", "NTA - I am crying now to find out that I am old at 51 (I am not really crying\ud83d\ude01). \n\nYou tried nice responses multiple times. She apparently can\u2019t understand that it is none of her business. Telling you a few times is caring. Saying it continuously is just being rude. \n\nYou may have to tell her to stop discussing you with your coworkers. I hope she doesn\u2019t turn out to be a trouble maker.", "NTA I have ARFID and the amount of times people think they have this magic new trick or recipe that will help me is exhausting. Not being able to connect over food is hard enough without the constant badgering.", ">Being \"old\"' (50-ish isn't that old anyway)\n\n{Shakes fist at cloud}", "It\u2019s certainly old enough to know better.", ">NTA,\n>\n>Being \"old\"' (50-ish isn't that old anyway) is not a license to be rude. \n\nYeah I still have to remind this to my 91 year old granddad with dementia.", "She's not the vegetarian. The vegetarian is my work friend. We were giving each other crap about our food choices.  Kate so happened to walk in on the conversation. Since then Kate has made comments about my dietary choices in a rude way.", "I am autistic.", "I am getting ancient\u202651 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019m 22 and my knees, hips, and legs hurt. Can\u2019t imagine at 50, oh man!", "One day doing the gardening and my back hurts for the next 3! (30 yo).", "Same age. Knees are okay, but hip is a whole other story.", "Exactly!", "Way ahead of you", "*Personally, IDGAF, how she shows she cares. If it makes someone uncomfortable, you stop. But I can't help but wonder if I'm in the wrong.*\n\nLove this!  OP you are definitely **NTA**! This is something I definitely do not miss about working in an office or any job with other people. Too many people think they have a right to your business. No. They don't.\n\nI like the allergic to meat comeback.", "NTA. As an older person, I've never thought age was a license to be obnoxious. This is not a way of showing she cares. She's just one of those older people who think they know better than younger people.\n\nAlso, I eat the same thing every day for lunch because it's convenient.", "We are picking at you! We are old compared to you! \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09", "It's okay, Grandpa Simpson!", "Maybe still work to broaden your horizons to the extent you're able. Personal growth happens at different rates for different people, but everyone can make progress if they're willing to push a bit. Kate and coworkers are still out of line, and you're still not the a-hole in any way, shape, or form.", "I am that asshole, I admit I love slightly burned microwave popcorn.", "me too!", "The allergic to meat comment was to one of my work friends. We give each other crap all the time.", "I think you misused the term hostile environment in your post unless you feel there was discrimination on the basis of a protected characteristic? But ironically your statement about older women and eating disorders, worded as it was, does put you in hostile environment territory (if it had been said in the work place). Had you made a generalisable statement about the link between age and eating disorders, you'd probably have been fine but you went too far and implied that because this particular woman was older she probably has an disorder. That's not ok.", "Not funny, I know, but I'm still laughing at your excellent delivery! *Nothing like having a gym class of third graders in tee shirts stuck outside in the winter because Tina can\u2019t stand in front of the damn microwave for four minutes and listen for the pops to slow down*", "Me too!!!", "Was literally just about to post this link myself! The comment at the top of this thread somewhat amazingly implies they are manager, mistakenly claims this is a hostile work environment and they would fire someone in this situation and then goes on to make a fairly extraordinary statement about older people and eating disorders that ironically would put them in the vicinity of a hostile work environment if said in the workplace. \n\nAnd just for anyone who wants to argue that last point - they started crossing the line when they said it \"shows in this case\". With that statement, they took it beyond a generalized statement that there is a correlation between age and eating disorders to \"this particular woman is older and therefore has an eating disorder\".", "The protected characteristic would be disability under my previous (erroneous) reading. If it was determined that the second coworker was informed by the first of the incident I\u2019d still consider it a risk.\n\nIn regards to the rest: you\u2019re totally right, and my place in a professional setting wouldn\u2019t ever be to point that out. Frankly, I would be in the wrong to defend either side to the other and I would simply look at the facts. But here we are on Reddit :)"]}
