When I was 10 I was diagnosed with autism. My autism causes some problems with eating. I rotate between 4 things for breakfast and have the same thing for lunch every day. That's the background, on to the story-\n\nAn older lady (50-ish) just started working here. Let's call her Kate. One day, a work friend (Amy) and I were in the break room. We were playfully teasing each other when Kate walked in. She asked me if I was allergic to vegetables and if that was why I ate the same thing every day. I asked her if she was allergic to meat as she is a vegetarian. Then we moved on, ate, and went back to work.\n\nEver since then, Kate will not stop making comments about what I eat. She is constantly trying to get me to try new things. \"It'll be good for you.\" I always say no thank you. This has been going on for a few weeks and it was getting on my nerves. I took her to the side and asked her to stop talking about what I eat and don't eat as it is making me uncomfortable. I will admit that I was firm with her. I did not shout or call her names, but I did not say it in the nicest way. She said that she was not aware of my feeling and promised to stop. I thought that it was all over. A couple days later, one of my coworkers asked why I shouted at Kate. I was confused and told this coworker what really happened. They said that I was still in the wrong and I should have never confronted her. \"She's older, that's how she shows she cares.\"\n\nPersonally, IDGAF, how she shows she cares. If it makes someone uncomfortable, you stop. But I can't help but wonder if I'm in the wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT- The whole \"She asked me if I was allergic to vegetables and if that was why I ate the same thing every day. I asked her if she was allergic to meat as she is a vegetarian.\" was between my work friend and I. I saw some confusion in the comments and wanted to clear that up. I don't mind my work friend saying that as that is our relationship. What Kate is doing is not the same.

That's ageism. That's the kind of misguided thinking that makes it brutally hard for laid-off people over 50 to find employment, particularly older women. And that should concern us all,  as we'll all be there some day. (And no, you won't somehow avoid that fate by being a magically cool old person that younger people instantly understand and love. )\n\nSo I hope you don't carry that attitude into the workplace, if you do manage one, because that kind of attitude could, indeed, lead to a hostile work environment.", "Yes, this.

That her behavior did stop does change my perspective and I appreciate the correction.\n\nIn regards to my sweeping statements in regards to disordered eating, I do mean to point that out as a form of compassion to the woman. Toxic Diet Culture and generational food shaming are highly studied fields. It\u2019s criminal the hyper-focus that has been put on food and it was socially ingrained for decades - particularly in the 50s-80s. There\u2019s a ton of other issues in regards to food but the specific act of food shaming is a particularly prevalent one in people born between 1940 and 1970. It\u2019s not even malicious. It\u2019s ingrained.", "Were it \"only\" once I might agree. Repeated, unwelcome behavior becomes hostile very quickly, almost immediately.

I didn't realize you'd meant that comment as a way to be more compassionate to Kate.\n\nYou are right -- a multi-generational workplace requires a full understanding of some of the cultural forces that shaped each generation. Not as excuses for bad behavior, ,but so each generation understands that behavior they might consider off or rude might be culturally ingrained. The trick of course would be not using it as an excuse for racism, sexism, and the like. \n\nI do worry its a slippery slope from \"these attitudes were common in this time period\" to \"all people this age have racist, sexist, messed up behavior hard wired into them, and will never be woke like us.\" Which precludes the possibility that generations before us had any admirable traits.\n\nIt's not only unfair, it makes younger generations lose out on the good that older generations bring, too. Such as maturity, balance, even-headedness, compassion, and memories of a pre-digital world where human connections were paramount.

I tried to apologize,  but I was so embarrassed I didn't do a good job of it. Do you think I should apologize again?\"\n\nAll I know is, as an employer,  is that it's a mistake to immediately assume ill intent.\n\n98% of the time things are misunderstandings. I've learned it's always best to start with questions rather than assumptions. \n\n So I wouldn't leap to assume Kate is trying to hurt OP. Probably more like slipping into an inappropriate \"mom\" level of concern about a younger person. She might be a mom coming back to the workforce with kids OP's age, who needs a wake-up call.  It's a common issue, and definitely needs to be addressed. Kate shouldn't do it.

Everyone is already helping everyone else all the time, and generally without even waiting for the formality of a request.\n\nAbsolute strangers will offer help in the form of health advice, such as \"Do you know that that stuff you're eating is poisoning your system?\" Mere acquaintances will help out by recommending exercise programs, diets and changes in hair style and wardrobe -- all on the assumption that you couldn't really look the way you do on purpose. Friends and relations are especially helpful in evaluating your other intimate ties. \"She's no good for you\" and \"You ought to know that everyone but you realizes he's a jerk\" are only the surface remarks. Analyses are also available, such as \"What you're really looking for is a mother\" or \"What you think is love is only unresolved guilt.\" The truly conscientious will not limit themselves to helping with the more exciting parts of life. They are also scrupulous about offering helpful suggestions regarding such mundane matters as your household arrangements, work habits, mannerisms and use of the language. There is nothing like a good friend to help you out when you are not in trouble.\n\nLife's little helpers reason that the first step toward improvement is the realization that things need to be improved. That is why they feel justified in approaching you when you are perfectly content in order to point out that everything you do, eat, and love is a dreadful mistake. Because they themselves are so full of good wishes for the rest of humanity, they do not expect their beneficiaries to be petty. They figure that upon being told how you have mismanaged your life, you will be grateful for the offer of assistance and reassured that others are watching out for you. It stands to reason that one who obviously does not know what is best for himself would be relieved to find that others are willing to take on that responsibility.\n\nAfter all, they don't just stop after telling you that is wrong, but always go on to explain in detail how you can do things the way they do them. In other words, the right way.\n\nMiss Manners would like gently to propose that everyone just cut out all this helpfulness right now. She suggest this first as a matter of manners. It is rude to call people's attention to their shortcomings, no matter how much you have their welfare at heart. It is rude to assume that anyone other than minors in your custody is less capable than you are of making minor and major decisions about how to live. No, it doesn't count if you prepare the way by attempting to convince people who don't realize it just how badly in need of help they are. In the etiquette lexicon, the statements necessary to break down a person's self-satisfaction to the point where he admits that he was in worse shape than he had fondly imagined are still called \"insults.\"\n\nThe following statements are all insults:\n* \"You really ought to be going out more.\"\n* \"Keep on smoking like that, and you'll be dead in five years, and you won't be able to say I didn't warn you.\"\n* \"Why do you waste your time reading that trash?\"\n* \"How can you let anyone treat you like that? If you had any self respect, you'd tell him where to go.\"\n* \"A good plastic surgeon could fix that.\"\n* \"Now's the time for you to have children, while you're still young enough to cope with them.\"\n* \"You just think you're in love.\"\n* \"You ought to have your colors done.\"\n\nMiss Manners might also point out that many matters commonly the subject of unsolicited help -- such as looks and character evaluations -- are purely subjective. Why should one person's estimation of what kind of haircut would flatter you be better than another's or than your own? On questions where there is generally conceded to be danger, the person who chooses to ignore the danger is bound to know that he is doing so at some risk. That smoking is bad for you, or that it is statistically perilous to marry someone who has had a dozen spouses who died mysteriously, has not escaped the awareness of the person who has decided to do this anyway. All that is added by helpful criticism in such a case is the information that others are standing by, expecting the worst.\n\n-- Judith Martin,\u00a0Miss Manners' Guide For The Turn-Of-The-Millenium", "What your reasons are for what you eat are irrelevant to the story.
