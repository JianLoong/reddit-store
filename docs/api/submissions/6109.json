We were playfully teasing each other when Kate walked in. She asked me if I was allergic to vegetables and if that was why I ate the same thing every day. I asked her if she was allergic to meat as she is a vegetarian. Then we moved on, ate, and went back to work. \n\nEver since then, Kate will not stop making comments about what I eat. She is constantly trying to get me to try new things. \"It'll be good for you.\" I always say no thank you. This has been going on for a few weeks and it was getting on my nerves. I took her to the side and asked her to stop talking about what I eat and don't eat as it is making me uncomfortable. I will admit that I was firm with her. I did not shout or call her names, but I did not say it in the nicest way. She said that she was not aware of my feeling and promised to stop. I thought that it was all over.

I used to just eat the butter in the little packets that came with rolls when we went out to restaurants.", "That also sounds like something that I would eat as a child.", "This comment is troubling to me, if you really are an employer. Kate's behavior was rude and clueless, but essentially well intentioned,  and does not rise to the level of \"hostile work environment\", particularly as she immediately stopped when asked. The 2nd employee getting involved is simply stirring the pot and should be ignored by OP.  \n\nOP doesn't mention getting management involved, but that's certainly a reasonable next step, so a good boss might have a chance  to address this.\n\nBut speaking as a fellow employer, I'm surprised by your statement  \"people of your coworker's age have a high level of deep-seeded disordered eating,\"\n\nThat's quite a sweeping generalization. That's ageism. That's the kind of misguided thinking that makes it brutally hard for laid-off people over 50 to find employment, particularly older women. And that should concern us all,  as we'll all be there some day. (And no, you won't somehow avoid that fate by being a magically cool old person that younger people instantly understand and love. )\n\nSo I hope you don't carry that attitude into the workplace, if you do manage one, because that kind of attitude could, indeed, lead to a hostile work environment.", "Yes, this. The concerning aspect here isn't so much the incident as the coworker misrepresenting what happened to paint OP as a bully. OP needs to get on top of that situation before it spirals.", "No, don't worry, no one thinks YOU called her old. They're just reacting to your coworker's argument and saying it's ridiculous.", "I am actually old. Old enough that being formally taught manners/etiquette as a child was a thing.\n\nIt was drilled into me that it is never ok to comment on what any one is--or is not--eating (the only possible exception being a host quietly asking a guest if the food is not to their liking/ can they provide anything different; then not saying anything more if the guest says they are alright).  Or to make make personal comments of any kind (even a complimentary \"you've lost weight\" can hurt if the person is ill).\n\nNTA. Busybody at work should mind her own business. (Another seldom-followed rule of etiquette).", "Yeah, same!!", "I have to say, your comment made me reread the post and I somehow missed/misread that it was a separate coworker who approached her a few days later. That her behavior did stop does change my perspective and I appreciate the correction.\n\nIn regards to my sweeping statements in regards to disordered eating, I do mean to point that out as a form of compassion to the woman. Toxic Diet Culture and generational food shaming are highly studied fields. It\u2019s criminal the hyper-focus that has been put on food and it was socially ingrained for decades - particularly in the 50s-80s. There\u2019s a ton of other issues in regards to food but the specific act of food shaming is a particularly prevalent one in people born between 1940 and 1970. It\u2019s not even malicious. It\u2019s ingrained.", "Were it \"only\" once I might agree. Repeated, unwelcome behavior becomes hostile very quickly, almost immediately. If someone is doing something you do not like, in regards to you, you have *every* right to ask them to stop. And if no one risks loosing life or limb by them stopping, they should bloody-well, f$#&g stop.", "Agree 100% the way my parents and all the adults in my life talked about food was insane (I\u2019m 25 for context.)", "Fair point. I didn't realize you'd meant that comment as a way to be more compassionate to Kate.\n\nYou are right -- a multi-generational workplace requires a full understanding of some of the cultural forces that shaped each generation. Not as excuses for bad behavior, ,but so each generation understands that behavior they might consider off or rude might be culturally ingrained. The trick of course would be not using it as an excuse for racism, sexism, and the like. \n\nI do worry its a slippery slope from \"these attitudes were common in this time period\" to \"all people this age have racist, sexist, messed up behavior hard wired into them, and will never be woke like us.\" Which precludes the possibility that generations before us had any admirable traits.\n\nIt's not only unfair, it makes younger generations lose out on the good that older generations bring, too. Such as maturity, balance, even-headedness, compassion, and memories of a pre-digital world where human connections were paramount. I've made a real effort to bring on older staff and create mentorship opportunities with good results.", "Oh, absolutely . And in this case, OP asked and she immediately stopped.", "No, \"hostile work environment\" is a very specific term legally. It's not just being rude to someone. If I keep telling you that your blonde hair is ugly, I'm being a dick, but I'm not creating a legal hostile work environment.\n\nThough in this case, if she had continued, it may actually apply, due to OP's autism.\n\nSee: https://www.askamanager.org/2015/01/hostile-workplace-its-not-what-you-think.html", "About the food, perhaps. Yet it did not stop \"Kate\" from acting like a petulant child bad mouthing her for getting her precious little fweewings hurt. Good look for a 50yo.", "*I* was not referring to \"hostile\" in the \"legal\" sense, simply as something more unpleasant than bullying, etc. By this, OP would have been in the clear to just tell the old bat to f%&# off.\n\nI agree that words have specific meanings, and that too many of us layman are not fluent in legalese.\n\nF$&#ing lawyers.\n\nUgh.", "Thanks for this! Ask a Manager is such a great blog!", "Well, we don't know how that actually went down though, do we? Kate might have said to the 2nd colleague, whom she mistakenly trusted, \"I feel like the world's biggest idiot! I was worried about OP's eating habits, and she actually had to \"yell\" at me before I picked up on how uncomfortable I was making her. I tried to apologize,  but I was so embarrassed I didn't do a good job of it. Do you think I should apologize again?\"\n\nAll I know is, as an employer,  is that it's a mistake to immediately assume ill intent.\n\n98% of the time things are misunderstandings. I've learned it's always best to start with questions rather than assumptions. \n\n So I wouldn't leap to assume Kate is trying to hurt OP. Probably more like slipping into an inappropriate \"mom\" level of concern about a younger person. She might be a mom coming back to the workforce with kids OP's age, who needs a wake-up call.  It's a common issue, and definitely needs to be addressed. Kate shouldn't do it. But probably well intentioned.", "Yeah, I'm sure the \"Kate\"s of the world rarely intend to \"hurt\"; they just think they know \"better\". \n\nAnd the \"Kate\"s who engage in such behavior seem to rarely ever consider their comments & actions are unwelcome & unwanted, at best.\n\nAnd they are rarely seriously, genuinely repentant."]}
