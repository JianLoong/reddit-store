Using pineapples that my boyfriend daughter is allergic to in a recipe. Even though I compromised and provided other options. \n2.

When I have people over, there are always a variety of food issues.  We have vegans and celiacs in our family along with pescatarians and people who are deathly allergic to shellfish.  I do the best I can, but there is usually something that someone can\u2019t eat.  I let everyone know who can eat what.  Usually folks are happy I\u2019ve been so accommodating.

But i dont think thats how it works..?", "NTA. It is your party you can decide the menu. You offered an alternative for her which is already accomadating enough.", "NTA. You have alternatives and you thought to ask. Everyone doesn't have to have everything at a party. I mean, it sucks, sure, but here, the needs of the many...", "NTA. Coming from someone with a nut allergy, this is totally reasonable.
