I am anaphylactic to shellfish and so is my daughter (she is also coeliac). Cooking seafood in the same room as us can cause a reaction. We don\u2019t expect people to change their menus for us. We simply use the excuse to not help in the kitchen that night, or if there will be a lot of seafood we decline the invite (husband and son usually go as that is their only option to eat it). No hard feelings from either side. I\u2019d feel awful for people to miss out because of us.", "NTA. As long as she know it\u2019s fine.

If some spills and she touches it will it make her skin itch and peel? If she accidentally picks up someone else's cup and takes one sip will her tongue tingle or will her throat close? Actually, YTA for risking any reaction when it's unnecessary. If she were an adult and had the choice whether to attend or not, then it would be different. She's a child, she has no choices, and you're an adult who should be able to handle a little disappointment over punch.", "YTA - Your witches brew is so important that you\u2019d risk liking someone over having at a party(an 8yr old child, of a guy you are supposed to care about)? It\u2019s going to ruin your party to find another recipe for a drink that might not kill a child at your party? It\u2019s not her fault she\u2019s allergic. There are 1000\u2019s of other beverages/snacks one can make for a party. I think your an AH for insisting on having an allergen. People\u2019s die or end up severely disable(look up the woman who was frozen in a contorted horrible state for the rest of her life by getting a bit of an allergen at a restaurant). \n\nIt seems obvious to me you resent your bfs daughter (probably for existing, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d rather have him be child free). If you didn\u2019t, you\u2019d just make something else. \u201cSomeone is allergic to X and Y so I\u2019m going to comprise and just make Y.\u201d This isn\u2019t a compromise. This passive aggressive \u201cshe doesn\u2019t have to drink it\u201d, and \u201cI have to have my pineapple drink\u201d is fucked up. Just go find a dude that doesn\u2019t have kids.", "YTA. You can make your brew with oranges or kumquats. You can make something else. You can break up with him, but you don't intentionally serve a known allergen with guests.", "How old is the daughter?!", "As some with allergies and intolerances, NTA", "NTA... unless the allergy is severe (epilepsy pen) then I'd be worried about cross contamination. \n\nBut not all foods have to be edible by all guests. That would be a nightmare.", "And as long as it\u2019s not a severe allergy to the point that being around food with pineapple is dangerous (and there is no indication this is the case) then it\u2019s fine.", "The other thought I had is depending on how the brews are dispensed - if any sort of ladle or extra utensil is involved and they're self-serve, I can see a fear of cross-contamination if people aren't careful about what they're using where (not mixing utensils between the two).\n\nHowever, that still doesn't mean it can't be served at all, it would have to either be pourable, be something the host is pouring for the guests, or the two drinks stations need to be far enough removed from one another that people aren't tempted to, for example, ladle five cups across both drinks with the same ladle and getting pineapple trace in the \"safe\" drink.\n\nIn short: serving the allergen by itself isn't an issue, OP would just need to make sure that everyone is aware that the safe option needs to stay safe for boyfriend's daughter and, if she isn't serving the drinks herself, will need to make sure that this is the case (this or the daughter has her own supply - maybe fill a water bottle or similar so she knows she has something that hasn't been contaminated). It's a little extra work, potentially, but would go some way to reassuring the boyfriend and his daughter that OP is taking the allergy seriously.", "It's nothing too crazy. I tweaked it so it'll make a little over a gallon.

She will have a fair amount of warnings and labels. I only have two flavors because of her. I didn't ignore her allergies. I asked to be aware of them. I was very accommodating by making it a nut-free zone too. I could've just said oh well , but I didn't.", "OP didn\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d make Y, they made Y and an alternative. One that the girl isn\u2019t allergic to, specifically for her to be able to drink. OP also ensured her other allergy was considered, and has no nuts for that reason. Did you read the post?\n\nNTA, OP, you\u2019re considering and accommodating, and ensuring the girl has alternatives.", "8 years old.", "This is just the start of this. You can expect his disapproval to escalate to anything he thinks you have done wrong. Run", "Yummy", "That's great. \n\nBut if he's getting upset about this, even though you have a separate option for her. He's going to get upset anytime you add nuts or pineapple to anything. You want to go out to a restaurant but ou cant order anything with pineapple or nuts and you'll have to leave because the table next to you has a pineapple drink, or pineapple pizza. \n\nHe'll find every reason to be MD at you and co trol what you eat and what you have in your house.\n\nThis relationship ship has run its course, it's time to end things.", "NTA then.", "I mean, any excuse to play with label makers is awesome. At 8, she may enjoy helping to make the labels with you and that'll reinforce what options she can have and can't. Def NTA.", "Yeah I read the post. I know that there\u2019s an alternative at the party. I just don\u2019t get that the pineapple punch is so important it\u2019s worth the risk. Best case scenario, some people get to drink a pineapple punch. Worst case scenario, this kid dies or is disabled. Like why not just make another kind of punch? Why is the pineapple punch so important that it\u2019s worth any of this? Seems like there\u2019s more to it.", "The allergy is the responsibility of the allergic person (and in this case, their parent). OP is even labeling the drinks. The kid knows their allergies, and can take care to drink the correct item. \n\nIt\u2019s not a big deal. The kid\u2019s parent is the only one making it a big deal. OP has handled the situation just fine.", "Whoaaaa. I love my boyfriend's daughter. I have a son, we both have kids. You want me to end my +2 relationship... Over punch?
