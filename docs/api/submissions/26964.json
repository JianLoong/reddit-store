Doing this negates the potential for human error.", "What about the severity of the allergy?", "Wait, but is she so allergic that cross-contamination could cause a serious reaction ?", "I would also advise keeping the punches away from each other so nobody mixes up the ladles. I nearly went to the hospital some years back when two kinds of brownies were together on a buffet\u2026I knew which one I couldn\u2019t eat, but people were swapping the serving utensils back and forth.

Not dunking on it either, it's very delicious and refreshing but it's also easy to tweak it. I don't see why substituting for orange juice or lemonade is such a huge kerfuffle for OP. I doubt she's that ignorant in the kitchen.\n\nI've hosted a lot of parties, especially parties with allergens in mind and it does not take that much effort to find alternatives. It's quite frankly just impolite to not find an alternative to the same beverage.

That's like one version of like thousands. There's millions of recipes for it and a lot of them don't have pineapple juice. Or you substitute and adjust. Like what's wrong with lemonade?

She realizes that if some spills or she drinks some by accident or someone cross contaminates it, that she could kill that sweet kid right?\n\nThat \"Nostalgia\" excuse is bad too. It literally took me less than a minute to find two alternatives with no pineapple juice for the same concept. Witches Brew isn't some special recipe she came up with, especially since it's sherbert based like a good chunk of childhood punches. It's so easy to not use something without the allergen.\n\nBasic hosting etiquette goes: You accommodate your guests. Not this \"trying to parent her even though I'm not mom\" crud. If 8 year old's mom is in the picture I wonder what she'd say about that.\n\nI host plenty of family events and I cook a lot of holiday meals and bring things to other meals.\n\nMy mom has a cashew allergy. We don't buy, serve or even entertain the thought of cashews.\n\nMy sister gets an asthmatic reactions to certain fragrances so we don't burn candles or incense around her when she's here that have extremely strong scents. (Which is pretty easy cause she only reacts to glade)\n\nMy little cousin has a lactose allergy and no one told me, until the day I was serving charcuterie as a light meal and I felt so bad and guilty. After that, I planned to serve ONLY allergy friendly foods and no longer take advice from my aunt who like OP had that mindset of \"She's old enough not to eat it\" yeah but it's also just not polite.\n\nLike, I know this sub is full of \"Don't even try to do anything for anyone, because what you want matters more\", but basic ETIQUETTE and manners is being ignored here. When your hosting an event it's not actually about you. It's about your guests and accommodating allergies is a big part of that. It doesn't matter if she's old enough to know better, it's about being kind, polite and loving.\n\n\nIt's SO easy to make that exact punch with lemonade or gatorade, or orange juice.\n\nI hope she's not in the South, because man that is a lack of hospitality and if I did that to a guest, my latina abuela and my southern grandma would both claw their way out of the after life, reconstitute themselves from ashes, to give me the biggest scolding of my life.\n\n\nEditing to add:\n\nThis took me less than a minute to find ALL OF THESE:\n\nhttps://www.delicioustable.com/haunted-halloween-witches-brew-party-punch/\n\nAnd this:\n\nhttps://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21468/witches-brew/\n\nAnd this too:\n\nhttps://www.designeatrepeat.com/orange-sherbet-punch-halloween-drink/\n\nhttps://easyeverydayrecipes.com/kids-halloween-party-drink/", "I agree with you.

And if she's asking for allergies and removes one but refuses the other, it's a power play and rude.\n\nMaybe it's my southern and latino genes, but if I was this rude to a guest, I'd be haunted for the rest of my days by my ancestors. It's common sense if it's bad enough she can't have it, don't have it. This mindset of \"Well, there's an alternative so it's fine\" it's not actually.

You have 0 empathy and manners.", "But maybe OP likes pineapple and wants that and substituting is not the same for them. It's also only one drink with an alternative that doesn't have pineapple. I get that allergies are not awesome for people who have to deal with it. But I know lots of people with allergies, like life threatening kind and they manage by being aware themselves. Because you can't expect everyone around you to always cater to you. An accommodation was made.", "I agree. She needs to go without for one night and her BF has every right to be upset and worried. She's acting like she did a huge favor by not having any peanuts either. \n\nIf she plans to live with this man at some point and the kid, then she needs to accept some things are going to have to just go and if you can't go without pineapple that long, I'm legit concerned. Like, I love pineapple, but I also don't have it that often because I get hellacious heartburn and need to take antacids before consuming it. \n\nIt just feels like rudeness and the people saying NTA, I just don't think realize that it's that optional. It's not some special recipe and the nostalgia excuse isn't really an excuse. My cousin is allergic to shellfish and we're latino. It's SO easy to axe all of the seafood dishes from our menus for her sake... and it turned out, later on we found out my aunt, her mom is also allergic to shell fish as well. So, in reality the switch was easy to make and keep permanent because the people we love is more important.\n\nMaybe this is just my latina and southern roots cause I have both, kicking in, but if I acted this way towards a guest and went out of my way to NOT provide an alternative and go without for a night, my abuela would claw her way out of her urn, reconstitute from ashes and go after me with her chancla for being so rude. And then my granny would do the same thing and go after me with her spoon for being so rude.", "He made another drink in addition to the one she\u2019s allergic to. \n\nThat\u2019s why I question if you read the post. \n\nOr if you understood it.", "I'm guessing \"Throat closing\" and she doesn't wanna admit it if BF is getting upset it's not being removed after she asked what everyone's allergies were and apparently nuts was \"stretching it\"", "Are you the boyfriend?

And I don\u2019t have to justify my manners and empathy to you either.", "It's not really good hosting though now is it? Accommodation was made for one allergy, not both. That's not very gracious hosting if you can't go without pineapple for one night. That recipe is all over pinterest and I won't repost the links I found but it is SO easy to replace that one recipe or one substance in it. It doesn't matter if OP likes something, if she can't go without it for one night, than that's just rude, impolite and frankly entitled.\n\nOr host a ladies night, at a later date, with the same brew she wants to have at this party, spike it and serve adult snacks and gossip.\n\nI've hosted people who cant' eat stuff I like. I just eat it/drink it when their not there. It's not the one time OP will get to host a Halloween party and you can make that for yourself any time. I don't limit my own cooking during fall to just hosting", "I\u2019d missed the bit about the nuts! I think that makes it worse in my eyes actually. People like OP seem to forget that an anaphylactic allergy (which I\u2019m assuming is what the stepdaughter has) doesn\u2019t vary in severity depending on the ingredient- if both are the same level of allergic, both should be annexed from the menu. People seem to assume that nut allergies are automatically worse than others (and I say that as someone allergic to them, among other things). \n\nI think non-allergic people also don\u2019t always understand that when you have food allergies food almost becomes a bit of a love language. So many people just can\u2019t be bothered dealing with it, so when someone cares enough to find or make something you can eat or choose a restaurant because they know you can eat there it means a lot. \n\nTo make the party completely allergen free would have been a really nice way for OP to show that she really cares about and loves her stepdaughter, and by extension her BF. It would have allowed them to have a night where they could really relax and not worry about her having an allergic reaction. \n\nI also just realised that if someone got a bit tipsy and spilled some punch, that could pose a big problem and be a nightmare to clean up if the daughter is touch allergic (even if she only gets rashes from touching it).\n\nEdit: also why does a nut allergy mean they can\u2019t have candy or desserts? I\u2019m anaphylactic to milk, eggs and nuts and still have candy and desserts (including \u201cnormal\u201d ones). That\u2019s just a cop out to pretend she isn\u2019t too lazy to check- I\u2019m sure the stepdaughter indulges in gummies and supermarket sweets at least.", "I did.\n\nIt's rude and asinine to not go without it for one night or substitute pineapple juice for lemonade.\n\nIt's a no brainer. \n\nIt's in the same aisle. If she's too ignorant in the kitchen to not manage to figure out how to make it without pineapple juice, she shouldn't be hosting.", "Ah the anti-empathy crowd...\n\nNo, I'm not, but unlike most of you, I was taught how to host an event and it is really crucial to not be an asshole to a little kid.\n\nDo you HAVE to?\n\nNo.\n\nIs it kind and really, not that hard?\n\nYes.", "It really does and the people in this thread going NTA or just label it just don't get it. Plus, kids are notorious for not washing their hands even at 8. Food allergies are severe and need to be taken seriously. Heck, when I was a kid I was friends with a girl who's entire family was vegetarian and my dad went out of his way, to make an entirely vegetarian lasagna (and frankly it was delicious filled to the brim with zuccini, spinach and mushrooms (after making sure no one had mushroom allergies)) and vegetarian chili and everyone at those events understood to NOT cross the streams and could be counted on to respect it... but that was a *lifestyle preference* not a \"life or death\"\n\nAnd there's so many different treats you can make too. Like, rice krispy treats doesn't involve peanuts, marshmallows don't have nuts. You can make a lot of popular treats too. Christmas Crack, which can be doctored up to be Halloween crack or \"House shingles\" for theming, can be covered in candies that look like eyes, ect. Bark is good too. Or make pumpkin brittle, with caramel and pumpkin seeds. She could've made this a bonding moment. Hell, one go to that worked for every party for me and my family, if no one had gluten or celiac issues, was chocolate covered pretzels, covered in different icing sugars and sprinkles. \n\nShe's a bad hostess and should be ashamed of herself frankly.\n\nLike, heck I posted *seven different recipes* for this same punch without the allergen. It's not hard at all to change it.\n\nOr if she didn't wanna try something new, swap pineapple juice for lemonade. It's literally that simple. Adding a second punch doesn't fix it, an alternative is still having it in the house.\n\n\nIf she had gone above and beyond and not had a shitty attitude, I bet BF would've been so happy and she'd have been getting ALL the GF brownie points...", "I think you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head here. Even if people don\u2019t agree with us about the necessity of keeping the party allergen free, I think most people can agree that it would\u2019ve been a really nice thing for OP to do. I just think that if she\u2019d been willing to put a little effort in, this could\u2019ve become a really nice bonding experience for them as a blended family. Instead, the memories of this party will always be a little tainted because of this tiff. \n\nI\u2019m sure OP\u2019s boyfriend has a list somewhere of safe sweets for his daughter- basically all food allergy families do. All OP had to do was ask for it or ask to go grocery shopping together. \n\nIt\u2019s not a hard allergen to substitute either. It\u2019s not like trying to bake egg or gluten free if you\u2019re an inexperienced baker (both perform multiple functions in baked recipes, so hard to replace without understanding what those functions are). It\u2019s a direct swap, since the only thing it effects is flavour. You just trade it for something else that tastes good.\n\nEdit: to me it\u2019s not really about safety, so much as it\u2019s about the message that it sends. When you make that effort for someone, it tells them that you really want them there and that you love them enough to go to those lengths and make that sacrifice for the night. When people just can\u2019t be bothered to accommodate at all it can feel a bit like they can\u2019t be bothered with you.", "Bingo. It's all about the message.\n\nAnd the message OP is sending is that the step kid is NOT important enough to her... because what happens when they move in together? BF's also gotta be thinking if she's not willing to change after ASKING what the allergies were what about when they're living together? Would she be able to go without Grandma's Peanut Butter PIe until kiddo is old enough to move out? What about if she develops more allergies?"]}
