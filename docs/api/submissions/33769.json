Of course they are mad, their free labour just grew a spine and said \"no\". They don't like that, you are the young woman, you should do what you are told, not get ill, not answer back and absolutely not expect anything at all in return. You know the shoe slogan \"Just do it\"? You need to adopt the other one \"Just say no\". You have your own life, or you should do. So say no, be busy that day, go out, meet friends, do not be the unpaid and unappreciated serf for these entitled brats. Oh, just a thought, is there something in their house that triggers your asthma? A pet, some mould? Smoke? something like that... if it's worse when you go there there could be a problem in the house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
