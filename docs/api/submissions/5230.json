When we first met he let me know that he is divorced with 3 children 6M 4F and a stepson 8M that he considers his son. \n\nHe also let me know his situation was unique and he was okay if I didn\u2019t want to continue dating. Him and his ex wife are great friends, they simple got married to young and realized they were different people. Neither wanted to split custody so they turned their home into a duplex, that way they could both see the kids everyday and if his son wanted to see him he could just come over. \n\nI can not have children and he explained he would not have more. Although it was a unique situation he\u2019s a great guy so I kept it going.\n\nNow onto a year he still is a great guy and I love him. However I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m on the side of the real \u201cfamily\u201d. His ex still comes to all the holidays, the kids knock and can come in whenever. One of the kids is not really even his but still has open access to him. I think now that we\u2019re serious things need to change.\n\nI suggested he moves so that we can maintain a life outside of the \u201cfamily\u201d and he can move on. Well he blew up and called me an AH for suggesting it. He said he isn\u2019t and never will be a \u201cweekend\u201d dad. But I\u2019m just trying to look out for us and start our family. My sister agrees I\u2019m the AH since he was upfront but am I really?

I mean, you\u2019re just his girlfriend of one year, and you expect to be more family than his kids.\n\nI don\u2019t think your boyfriend needs to make a choice between you or his family. These relationships shouldn\u2019t be mutually exclusive. I get that over time, his attention to his family began to bother you, but he was fully upfront about his expectations when you started this relationship.\n\nYour boyfriend sounds like a great guy and a great dad.

It works for them so thetes no reason to move. You feeling 'outside the family ' is a you issue, it doesn't mean you need to seperate him from his kids. \n\nFrom reading your comment you  feel 'outside the family' because you don't like their parenting arrangements. \n\n\nWell guess what.. he was parenting these kids long before you came into his life and he'll still be parenting them after you leave. It actually sounds like they have an amazing arrangement and it certainly wouldn't stop you having a life together if he didnt move.", ">\"One of the kids is not really even his\"\n\nYTA. Wow.", "YTA\n\nHis kids are already his family, and if you want to be apart of it then you're gonna have to accept the kids.

They get A++! \n\nYou knew and he was very upfront, you decide it was acceptable. His children (ALLLLLLLLL OF THEM) are important. \n\nIf things progressed are you allowed to ask they knock on your bedroom/bathroom door bc privacy? Absolutely. Can you occasionally ask for a romantic night away as a couple? Of course! Not unrealistic. Can you ask the kids to wipe their feet? Totally reasonable. Maybe ask for a romantic dinner at home without the kids interrupting once in awhile? Sure. \n\nAsking to move away from children when you knew it from the beginning EEHHHHHH NOO. These children are important. You will be a working part of a bigger unit. This could be an amazing thing with a whole new amazing family.  You may not want the same things.

Him and his ex are over... but that doesn't change their responsibilities when raising the children as co-parents. \n\nYou may come second to those ideals, but didn't you know that going into a relationship with a man who has children? Isn't that a good/honorable thing? \n\nThe housing situation may be unique, but doesn't that greatly simplify things? \n\nIs there some beef between you and his ex? According to what is written here, all things seem to be mutal and respectful... I mean, its been a year. What has changed?", "YTA\n\nHe was clear right at the start about his situation.

Start what family? This is the family. Are you in or are you out?", "I'm sorry but you are the AH. Your BF was upfront about what he wanted and about the fact his children were a priority. They basically live with him, it's as much his home as it's their basically, so they are allowed to come and go whenever they want. Point is: from your post it seems like he explained to you everything before hand and you agree, probably without understanding fully what you were accepting.\n\nHis children are a part of his life and always will. \"Moving on\" doesn't include abandoning them or being less of a father to them.", "YTA\n\nThis is what works for him and his family.  He was up front about it, up front about not wanting to change it, and up front about the fact he knew many people would not be OK with it...but in that case, those people were not for him.  You decided you were OK with it.  \n\nIt's OK to change your mind and decide that actually, you're not feeling this set up the way you thought you would.  But you shouldn't expect him to change his position.  The way that you're saying \"now that we're serious\" and \"now that we've been together for a year\", it feels like you always thought this was something you just needed to tolerate for a bit before you could throw your weight around and demand a different set up.  \n\nBut he was always very clear that he would not be changing.  His kids come first, and he's not interested in any set up that fundamentally changes how things work now.  Yes, there are tons of other ways to do things, but THIS is what he wants and THIS is what works for his family.\n\nThe only thing you can decide is whether this works for *you*.  If it doesn't, then like he was clear about when you first started dating, he's probably not the guy for you.", "YTA \"one of the kids is not really even his\", yes he is. Your BF sees him that way, ex does, kid does, you're the only one going after semantics. If you can't even accept that then there's nothing you can do to accept their family dynamic.", "YTA.\n\nIf you're dating someone with children and your issue is the presence of children, you're dating the wrong person.\n\nAnd if you have the nerve to suggest his step-son isn't really his kid, you're the one who needs to go.", "YTA. The truth is you\u2019re only his gf of a year. He was upfront about everything an you knew full well what you were getting into.", "YTA. He\u2019s not the one if you can\u2019t handle this.

He's being a truly good father. YTA.", "YTA - Don't date dads unless you're willing to accept that their children come first.

He was up front with you about his situation and you agreed with it at the time. \n\nI suppose it would be understandable if this were just a case of 'I underestimated how difficult the arrangement would be for me, so I shared my feelings with him but told him it was ultimately his decision'. But there are a lot of little red flags in your post that make me think you were quite a bit more forceful/manipulative than that.\n\n1) The title- not 'AITA for asking my boyfriend if he would consider moving', but 'TELLING him he NEEDS' to move.\n\n2) 'Although it was a unique situation he was a great guy so I kept it going'. Nothing about you being OK with the living situation, just that he's a great guy, meaning that either you put off thinking about it because you liked him, or you thought you could get him to change his mind later.\n\n3) The fact that 2/3 of your paragraph about not being part of his 'real family' isn't even about the ex, it's about the kids. The kids should ALWAYS come first!\n\n4) Referring to his stepson as 'not really even his'. That's just disgusting.\n\nHis living situation may be unique, but you don't sound very unique at all- you want your partner who already has kids to put you before his children.

On Christmas morning they will all be at our house for brunch (and that includes his ex).  These relationships can be beautiful and great for the children if they are given a chance.

To not feel like you are \u201con the side.\u201d *You need to express these needs,* clearly and with love, and it\u2019s possible to do that without unreasonably expecting your boyfriend to abandon his valuable emotional connection with his kids for you. \n\nSo what would make you feel more involved? He\u2019s given you the option of moving in, which feels like an excellent way to feel more involved. Do you want to have a different or more significant role during holidays (making a certain dish, organizing gift time, helping plan the day, etc.)? Would it help you feel more connected if you took the time and effort to bond with BF\u2019s kids rather than seeing their presence as unreasonable and a burden? \n\nIt\u2019s possible to come back from this if you apologize to your BF and explain what you really mean and need, if these things get at what you really mean and need.

If not then move on and find someone else that can give you what you need. It would be a little different if he didn't tell you up front but he did and did it before it got real serious.

You are essentially asking him to choose you or his children. He was right to get upset about you wanting him to give up his closeness to his children so you can devote more time and attention on you.  You knew exactly what you were getting into at the beginning of the relationship and had no problems with it.  To change your mind a year later, not acceptable.\n\nHe only has so many years to teach his kids and raise them before they are adults.

He took on the dad time 100% and I commented him for that.\n\nIf your issue is stemming from feeling to much\"neglect\" for the relationship between the two of you, that's fair and worth the two of you sitting down and coming up with a plan together.

When we first met he let me know that he is divorced with 3 children 6M 4F and a stepson 8M that he considers his son. \n\nHe also let me know his situation was unique and he was okay if I didn\u2019t want to continue dating. Him and his ex wife are great friends, they simple got married to young and realized they were different people. Neither wanted to split custody so they turned their home into a duplex, that way they could both see the kids everyday and if his son wanted to see him he could just come over. \n\nI can not have children and he explained he would not have more. Although it was a unique situation he\u2019s a great guy so I kept it going.\n\nNow onto a year he still is a great guy and I love him. However I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m on the side of the real \u201cfamily\u201d. His ex still comes to all the holidays, the kids knock and can come in whenever. One of the kids is not really even his but still has open access to him. I think now that we\u2019re serious things need to change.\n\nI suggested he moves so that we can maintain a life outside of the \u201cfamily\u201d and he can move on. Well he blew up and called me an AH for suggesting it. He said he isn\u2019t and never will be a \u201cweekend\u201d dad. But I\u2019m just trying to look out for us and start our family. My sister agrees I\u2019m the AH since he was upfront but am I really? Would having him move out really be an AH thing?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Get over yourself.", "YTA what family are you hoping to start with him? He has his family and by going out with a single dad, you should be wanting to join his family, not take him away from it.

Been seeing this a lot on here lately, partners who feel the parent they're dating needs to prioritize them more. Every single time, the answer will be the same: they are right to focus on their children. You SHOULD always come after them.

You knew the situation and accepted it but now that you're serious, you think you're entitled to ask for it to change? I understand your feelings of being a side family, but you are not.

If you press the situation by issuing an ultimatum, then you would be an AH. \n\nI think you're in the unfortunate situation of deciding whether you want to join that little family group long term or to move on.

His happy, healthy, stable family that he loves and wants to be with? \n\nI don't fault you for wanting to be with someone who can give you the attention you deserve, but it shouldn't come at the expense of his family that he clearly wants to prioritize.

Now, a year later, you\u2019re recognizing that the reality of the situation may be more than you can handle. You\u2019re not an asshole for that.\n\nBut, I have to give you a soft YTA for two reasons.\n\nFirst, I hope you can see that the issue isn\u2019t with his behavior or even with the circumstances. *The issue is with your own insecurity.* You, admittedly, feel like you\u2019re not really part of the family. You also can never have children and know that your boyfriend doesn\u2019t want any additional children. Thus, the man you love shares something with his ex-wife that you can never fully share. That\u2019s a huge blow, and it\u2019s something I think you need to talk over with him. (It might not hurt to see a therapist, too, if that\u2019s within your means. Sometimes, that outside, objective perspective is extremely helpful.)\n\nBut the bigger issue I see is your veiled *contempt* for his children. DNA isn\u2019t all that defines family. If your boyfriend considers the youngest child his son, *he is his son.* In a world where many parents all too quickly walk away or weaponize their kids, your boyfriend and his ex-wife have managed to create a blended family in which the children\u2019s needs are prioritized over the adults\u2019 egos, and the result is that the kids have open access to *all* of their parents\n\u2014 potentially including you if you can get over yourself and embrace it.", "YTA - you knew what you were getting into and now want to change who he is because it doesn't work for YOU!  It seems to work great for everyone else involved so suck it up and work it out like a family would or move on.  You love them ALL or you don't.", "YTA, no further explanation needed.", "YTA.

You are asking him to give up something that is very important to him. He will become resentful of you if he gives this up.

Out of all the examples and reasons why their relationship is making you uncomfortable, I don't get why you've been referencing that one in particular a few times. He has 3 kids that range from 4 - 8, and they've probably been doing it for a while, and I don't see why that is an issue in general.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI wish I had my parents that were like his situation when my family divorced like he is.

At least that's the impression you've given:\n\n>I suggested he moves so that . . .  he can move on.\n\n\"Move on\" from WHAT? He has already moved on from his ex-wife.

Because that's not at all okay.\n\n>But I\u2019m just trying to look out for us and start our family.\n\nI mean, I'm very confused by what \"your family\" looks like to you. You've said that you cannot have children of your own. Do you expect him to leave his behind and create a new, separate family with you that DOES NOT INCLUDE HIS CHILDREN? Because again, that's not just AH behaviour, it's horrifying. You're talking about literally pushing a parent to abandon his children in some significant way. Why would you WANT him to do that? Why wouldn't a family with you include his kids?\n\n>Would having him move out really be an AH thing?\n\nIt's not about the moving out. It's about your wanting to cut him off from his kids. He is in an ideal situation right now, and you have been sketchy about clarifying why you want or need him to move out. The answers you've given seem to have little to do with his ex and mostly reference not wanting his kids to have so much access to him. Which is confusing and more than a little horrifying.\n\nBut at the core of it it's simple: yes, **YTA**.

All 3 children are his kids\n2. Your bf is teaching bis kids, just because his ex and him dont love each other as romantic partners its still possible to maintain friendships and that exs or not everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness.\n3. You know why the 8yo includes his mum in plans, because she's his bloody mother, of course he wants her included - Im 30-fucking-6 and I still enjoy doing things with my mum.\n4. Im not divorced, gods willing, i never will be, but I can not imagine a day going by without seeing my kid. I want to be an active part of his life, something the majority of loving fathers want to do. Your bf is no different. \n5. Your bfs ex does things for his family because she knows them. She likely loves and cares for them in the way most civil relationships are. You say she jumps in and does things without considering you. Have you tried discussing this with her? Something like, do you mind if I do x for Y, I understand you normally would, but I'd like to be a more active partner and get to know his family. I bet the ex doesn't do this to spite you and rather out of automatic reflex.\n6. Your bf has made his boundaries clear. He has given you possible solutions so that he can continue to be an active part of his kids' lives and still develop his relationship with you. But you have dismissed all out of hand because it would mean your bf still gets to keep being a good father. \n7. If this unique family dynamic is not for you, that is fair and understandable, you do not have to stay.\n8. What really disgusts me, though, and what really makes you a real piece of work is your expectation that you bf should choose you over his own kids and that he should be thankful for it too.
