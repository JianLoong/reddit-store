If your language doesn't have it as a standard element (which is the case of English, for example), most people will just don't know.\n\nIt's also common to drop those accents in internet communication (eg in Portuguese it's very common to skip the accents because you must press two keys instead of one to type them, and ofc people will write \"tambem\" and not \"tamb\u00e9m\").\n\nOverall, my take is that you have the right to want your name spelled correctly, but it is a battle you will lose, so cut your losses.", "Well, C\u00e9line Dion doesn't use the accent on her English recordings, so I guess it isn't that big of a deal.

Now I am a French Canadian / Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise. Though I was mostly raised in Australia and France due to my parents, work. I am fluently bilingual.\n\nNow I have a French first name which is spelled with an accent on the e like this \u00e9.\n\nHowever I find that most people in Toronto just ignore the accent. This annoys me as my name is spelled with an accent; the accent is part of the letter. It's like refusing to cross a t and say that it is the same letter. Usually when I tell people to correct the spelling they give me an annoyed look, some mutter some typical Qu\u00e9bec bashing stuff. Some people are good and always make a point to spell my name correctly.\n\nHowever one TA told me point-blank that I am being ridiculous. He said that none of the other international students want their names written in Chinese / Russian / Arabic / Indian characters and that I need to stop acting like i'm special. I told him though that French like English uses the Latin alphabet so it is the same chracter set, we just have some extra characters that they don't. Some of my friends are siding with me, others say that I need to let go\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a similar issue where my name is spelled with an s but in the English speaking world it\u2018s spelled with a z. I went abroad to study and have given up on telling people when they spelled it wrong although it is mildly annoying me. I also find it disrespectful if it\u2018s such a minor adjustment but oh well. I only correct my name on official documents and such now because it needs to be spelled the same as on my passport so I can\u2018t take chances there. Otherwise, I let it go - can\u2018t win.", "Well, French is an official language of Canada so you're within your rights to insist. That said, accents aren't spelling as much as a guide to pronunciation where more than one sound or stress is possible. As there won't be any variation in English pronunciation, it doesn't make much difference in practical terms. I'll go with NAH.", "I've a french name and I'm living in Germany, so I get this. I do have to spell the name out for them everytime in order for them not to fuck it up too much, and the \"\u00e9\" part is really the least of my worry since the name is pretty much inderstandable without it. The thing is most people do not even know of to write it on a computer and will struggle, so I'll just tell them to let it be and thank them for trying anyway.\n\nMy father as a french name too, with an \"e\" at the end. He got missgendered as a woman very often in letters and stuff, since German do not add \"e\" at the end for male names. So in the end, he just dropped it when writing his name.\n\nThe thing is, Canada may be bilingual but the english part may not know how to write those accent. I understand the annoyance completely and I do not think anyone is in the wrong here. As long as everyone is reading and understanding the name fine it should be ok. I work with a lot of foreign people in a university setting. It can get tiresome very quickly dealing with names, so I get the annoyance on both sides. More often than not, the problem can be technical too : the system (computer, keyboard etc) may not support the accent. I prefer to not have an accent any time than seeing my name butchered without the letter at all, or some strange weird string of symbols. I actually had this happened several times even in french-speaking countries.\n\nSometimes life is just bothersome for everyone involved. So NAH. Insisting and dying on the this hill will make you one though", "NTA - Why do you care though? People misspell my name all the time when they write me checks. My bank doesn't care so I don't care.", "NAH.\n\nI get it, you want your name spelled properly. But you have to consider the culture of the place youre going to as well.\n\nHonestly, youre going to keep fighting this uphill battle unless you live somewhere French.

Stand your ground!", "TA is an asshole.\n\nNTA, but is this happening when people are typing or writing by hand? Because in typing, I wouldn't let it bother you \u2013 it may simply be a technical issue. It took me a long time to figure out the keyboard shortcut of how to do that, and most people probably want to put the accent in there but just don't know how to do it.", "NAH\nI am also from Quebec,  also fluently bilingual, and I understand completely where you're coming from.  But there is one  thing that is important to mention.  English does not have an \u00e9, and that it is not necessary.   There are many pronunciations of the letter e in English, and as we never use accents, we can usually pronounce the word properly without an accent.  In other words, in English, it is not misspelled.  When I am writing in English, neither my wife nor I use the \u00e9 that is in her name.  In addition, the pronunciation of \u00e9 is very easy to pronounce for any English speaker, making a written accent a moot point.\n\nWhat we are talking about here is called a transliteration,  which is translating a word as closely as possible into a target language.  To properly do so in English, you would omit the accent.\n\nAll this being said, it really is not a hard thing to do if someone asks you to.", "NTA getting someone\u2019s name right is basic respect. I have a somewhat similar situation as my name has one letter difference from another name. some people use other name as a nickname for my name but i do not. \n\nwhile both names are common, the other name is much more prevalent in the country where many of my colleagues are located. a lot of these colleagues have called me this other name at some point, despite the fact that i have never used it in person, email, etc. it is annoying.\n\nbc of this i make a point when replying to emails to spell the person\u2019s name exactly as they have done in their message to me. if it includes an accent or other kind of mark, i copy/paste the name bc thats easier than typing it out. \n\nwhen i was in school i didn\u2019t run into this issue much but i would definitely have corrected my professors, managers, etc.", "NTA.

As someone with a name that if spelled with an \"I\" is usually a male name in many other parts of the world and if spelled with a \"Y\" is the feminine form, get over yourself.

My last name got mangled sometime after my dad was born, so it's now misspelled and without an accent and well I just deal. You can write your name with the accent, and as long as your TA is pronouncing it fine, there's nothing to complain about.

I was going crazy trying to figure the stupid thing out!", "You're the asshol\u00e8.", "Toronto doesn't seem to have very many French speakers. I took Spanish in school, but don't remember much. With languages, you use it or lose it.", "God, you're one of those people. \n\nGood luck lmao", "I can't speak for Ontario, but I can tell you that, in BC, due to the way the French courses are structured, you're not really doing any typing until maybe French 11 and 12, and, at that point, French is optional. The required French is only a couple of years and it's basically vocabulary and some very basic grammar. \n\nThat said, French isn't very relevant in BC. Mandarin or Punjabi would probably be more useful.", "Maybe it should be common knowledge in Canada, but you gave that snarky \u201cnot that hard\u201d reply to a Redditor whose country of origin you don\u2019t know. THAT\u2019s the attitude issue people are talking about.", "You have no right be mad at someone's ignorance if you really believe that every Canadian takes french in school.", "Capitalizing \"French\" also isn't hard. Sometimes people are simply lazy when typing/writing.", "As a Canadian who took French in school for years: this is not common knowledge. All my classes were pen on paper except computer class. I\u2019m only in my 30\u2019s.", "I'm canadian. French was required up until grade 6, then it was optional. I chose the other option, I don't know a lick of French. Your experience is not everybodys experience, and Quebec is basically its own seperate country in Canada", "Hey guess what, French isn\u2019t mandatory in all Canadian schools. \n\nSincerely,\nA Canadian who didn\u2019t take French in school. \n\nYTA.", "Not everyone went to a good school that taught that level of French. In BC I only had to take French for like a year or two in highschool and they definitely never taught us how to use accents on a keyboard. It\u2019s not common knowledge.", "Only very begrudgingly, especially out here in the West where nobody speaks it and don't find any use for it.\n\nAlso, older millenials still used pen and paper when they were in school. Laptops weren't even allowed, let alone affordable enough for most students up until not that long ago.", "I mean, they were such an AH on this post alone that all their comments were removed by the moderators and their account was banned, so I wasn't wrong.", "That's what I came here to say. Your name is your name. It's totally reasonable to want it spelled and pronounced the way it's spelled and pronounced. That doesn't make you an AH.\n\nI think where it could lean into AH territory is if this is a hill you want to die on for low stakes. Getting your order at Starbucks, making a dinner reservation, etc are all low-stakes interactions with strangers and you've got better things to spend your energy on. Legal documents, anything work-related or professional, close friends, dating apps etc should all reflect the correct spelling of your name and it's fine to correct people and ask them to address you by your name. If you're building personal or professional relationships, it's 100% reasonable to want people to know who you are. But if the dry-cleaning is mislabeled? Eh. Let that one go.", "I would keep in mind, the further west you go from Ottawa, the less French exposure there is. And the requirements at school lessen as well.  At least that was the case 30 years ago.", "Nope. You are speaking simply from your own personal anecdotes and do not have the authority to say that every person raised in Canada learned this and knows this.", "It's probably worth pointing out that education is a provincial responsibility, and the only bilingual *provinces* in Canada are Quebec and New Brunswick.  \n\n\nETA: I worded this badly. They're the only two provinces where French is an official language (New Brunswick due to the Acadien population). I believe Quebec is officially unilingual--French only.", "Jeez, you sound supremely entitled and insufferable. YTA and if you ever work with Chinese people, I expect you to learn how to type their name in Chinese characters ok? Thanks", "I was born in HK, raised in Canada, been here 27 years, can speak 4 languages, took French in high school and do not know that accented e off the top of my head. You can\u2019t generalize like that", "I was raised in Canada (BC) and I do not remember how to do it, and I did French immersion school throughout elementary and high school. It's just a pain to remember the shortcuts so I have to Google it every time.", "I know right....try correcting a local bogan at the local chippy on pronunciation \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Girl I also have a French name with an accent. Nobody uses it, you need to get over this. They are not discriminating against you.", "Please tell me you don't genuinely believe the reason special characters aren't allowed in usernames is because americans hate inclusivity?", "Toronto is an English language environment, and OP is being insistent on accommodating a requirement that is not well supported in English-language infrastructure or education. \n\nWtf are you talking about?", "It's not an official language *provincially*.", "I\u2019m a tri lingual speaker, also with a non English name. You sound like you have a superiority complex over English speakers. YTA.", "Official language only matters in official contexts. You've established that you gripe over this in whatever scenario it arises. \n\nAlso YTA because you came here to prove to everyone that you are right, and not to find out Reddit's judgment. It speaks volumes.", "The offical language of Ontario is English, much like Quebec is French.  I'm sure you're real accomodating of non French speakers in Quebec.", "I have a similar experience, with French not being an option and having to take it for grade 3-6, the main things I remember learning are how to ask to go to the bathroom/get a drink, sing the days of the week, and read a clock in French but I didn\u2019t know how to do it normally so it was twice as hard.\n\nAlso I was messing around with my phone (apple) and if you hold down on the letter it gives you the accent thingy, happened by accident when I was trying to type a lot of a letter. It\u2019s a bit of a weird thing to put it as, I\u2019m not sure how many things they have but thought it might be a fun little thing to know.", "Now I can type saut\u00e9 on NYT cooking website without shame.", "[removed]", "Are there Canadian schools where French isn't required to be taught? Once I got to highschool it was an elective but from grades 3-9 it was just a part of our curriculum. Granted, that was a while ago now, but I just assumed that since the curriculum is fairly standard across the country that everyone has to take French for at least a little while.", "What is that have to do with her comment about Reddit", "god your arguments were fun. A+.", "So that means 91.4% of people in Toronto won't know how to do \"\u00e9\" off the top of their head, and would have to spend 10 minutes googling how to do it and reading guides that fail to mention which set of numbers is needed.", "How many of those speak English and type with English keyboards?", "Alberta it's 4th-7th. I can't speak for private or charter schools. I remember singing about pizza, learning that numbers are fucked up, and having to hold my pee because I couldn't remember how to ask to go to the bathroom in French.", "Just typical Quebec stuff as we Torontonians like to call it.", "\u00c1 you mean", "Fun maybe. Good, not at all.", "[removed]", "I was trying not to \"go there\" because some of the Quebecois I've met are the best people on Earth.  But OP really hits that stereotype don't they.", "I think if someone tried to pull this shit here in Alberta they would be physically run out of town.", "No they didn\u2019t? Literally none of my coworkers learned this in school and we are all from Ontario and on the border of Quebec.", "Except they probably haven't had to use it and have forgotten how since they were in school. I took physics in school, couldn't tell you a thing about it.", "I\u2019m born and raised Canadian. Live in the only bilingual province in the country. Have no clue how to make accented letters. YTA. My name is misspelled all the time, and it\u2019s an extremely easy name. Get over yourself.", "NO THEY DIDNT!!!! You are speaking from your personal experience. Unless you took French immersion or took French up to grade 12, you likely didn\u2019t learn this.", "No we didn't. Where I grew up French was only required 4tg-7th grade and I don't remember learning much at all. We definitely didn't learn French typing.", "Nope", "Yeah, as I said above, in BC, you're basically not doing any typing unless you take French past what you're required to. The required courses are mostly workbooks, or at least they were when I was a kid.", "[removed]"]}
