Anyways I am not ethically asian. This is important because when I showed up to the Halloween party one of my friends who is Chinese pulled me to the side and told me to go home and change. At first I thought it was because my costume was too revealing (the skirt was kind of short) but my friend told me that it's because I'm committing cultural appropriation and gestured to my costume. I laughed it off then because I had half hopes that she was joking and it was in line with who she was as a person to joke about such thing. I quickly learned that she was not joking as soon as she yelled at me for being a shitty racist. I asked her how it was as I was just dressing up as the character and she said I can not cosplay her because I'm not asian. I told her that's ridiculous and that you can't limit people to only dress up as characters that they share a race with. After back and forth she stormed off and I went on throughout the night enjoying the party. Towards the end I had a few friends come up to me telling me that what I did was wrong and that I should t speak over asian voices etc. At this point I was fed up and I ended up going home and taking the costume off and it's now in the trash. It's been a few days and I don't think that I am in the wrong but all my friends believe me to be so I am incredibly confused.

It sounds like you didn't do anything offensive, though as your friends demonstrated, not everyone agrees. So there can never be a hard rule. I don't think it's automatically off limits to dress up as a character that happens to be another race as a white person BUT I would just consider the consequences because it's always going to put some people on edge, even if you do it thoughtfully. And ultimately you have to make a choice, do I want to be technically right or do I want to avoid upsetting my friends? The fact that a lot of people dress up as other races to be overtly racist is why people can get sensitive about this, even though that's not what you were doing. It reminds people of that so they get upset. In a vacuum, the hair chopstick shouldn't be a big deal but I could see some people arguing on that one.

I kind of understand why your friend would be upset because I had to take a look at the character and it looks like the inspiration behind it is Japanese kitsune and the boots are koi inspired, but the character (can't really help it its in pretty much all video games) has issues with the fetishization of traditional Japanese garments in making the outfit look really short and revealing. There's a chance that your friend is used to being sexualized as an Asian woman, because, honestly from my childhood of being even a halfie (half German/Chinese) it's frustrating being called exotic constantly and seeing a culture you grew up in reduced to that. That being said, I think it might be more an issue with the character design than the character in this case, but I'm going to go with NAH unless you did something to change the shape of your eyes ect.", "ESH.

Asian women are very oversexualised in Western society already, so when I see people dressing up in these type of costumes (including even other Asian girls sexualising themselves through an outfit like \u2018qipao, but made to be extremely revealing\u2019) I don\u2019t really like it as I think in a subtle way these kind of costumes reinforce that idea in society of the Asian woman as a hypersexual being.

I am Asian American myself and what OP did was completely benign.", "I'm getting so many new words to Google today I love it", "Haven't the Alderaanians suffered enough without this blatant appropriation?", "I've also seen a black D.Va at an anime convention. Anyone who would have told her that she was culturally appropriating Korean culture would have been laughed out of the con. I don't see any difference between that and OPs situation here\n\nOP is NTA, and the friend needs to check her ego", "I was wondering what race Chewbacca is...", "Actually black people get told all the time that they're committing a great sin by dressing up as white characters, the whole thing is that they don't want their characters to be a different race for whatever bigoted reason their small minds can think of", "Exactly! She wasn't trying to be Carrie Fisher.", "[deleted]", "OP is definitely NTA but I do want to push back on the idea that Asian Americans are not \u201cAsian voices\u201d. The reason that most Asian Americans care significantly more about issues like cultural appropriation than Asians in Asia is because, as residents of a country where they are not the majority race, they often have to deal with the ramifications of racial stereotypes against Asians significantly more than an Asian who lives in a nation where they are the majority might. For instance, a Viet person in Vietnam who sees a white person wearing an ao dai without pants might think \u201cwow that\u2019s silly\u201d but a Vietnamese person in America might have more concerns about the misrepresentation of their culture.", "Sorry colonizer you dont get an opinion on whats appropriation", "No I did not just the makeup of the character", "Absolutely, I\u2019m sorry people here don\u2019t seem to be open to your opinion because I really understand what you are saying (also Asian woman). I think a lot of people unfortunately don\u2019t understand these nuances, fictional characters are made by real people and often that involves very real and existing stereotypes, which fictional characters absolutely reinforce. You are so right and it\u2019s interesting how people are so against trying to understand what you\u2019ve said when a lot of them probably aren\u2019t even bothered to critically think about it and immediately took a stance based on being anti-woke. Thank you for saying this and don\u2019t let random people who likely aren\u2019t even Asian themselves convince you otherwise \ud83d\ude47\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", ">Her opinion may have been too rigid.\n\nHer opinion was neither of import or valid. Unless she is from the fictional land of runetarra she can't say shit about it.", "NTA - Not dismissive enough you mean. \"cultural appropriation\" what a joke. LOL.", "Hi! What culture in Asia has people with tails and fox ears?", "What\u2019s considered \u201cstealing culture\u201d. Genuine question. In my head I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s pretty ridiculous to be upset if someone is RESPECTFULLY taking part in whatever culture they enjoy.", "Lol I said this and got ten down votes, good luck here it's all white dudes with anti woke boners", "That Asians are the only race that don\u2019t have ears or a tail? Did you not check the patch notes?", "My father, an expert in the field of space station plumbing,  didn't get killed on that Death Star for me to not be able to appropriate a dying culture.  It's my birthright.", "But Darth Vader is a Nubian God!", "Wookie, if I remember right.", "Ahri isn't even Asian! She's from a fictional fox race from a video game \ud83d\ude44", "I agree with actually traditional things, but this is a character.  A character based on a *Korean* mythical animal.  So her friend is screaming about 'cultural appropriation' when it's not her culture.", "That is incorrect, but sure lol. There\u2019s a definition to appropriation, what OP did isn\u2019t that.", "Some cultural, religious, fraternal and national rituals are limited to insiders of that group and cannot be copied in any respectful way by outsiders.", "Wookiee, actually", "Totally agree that OPs friend is being unreasonable in this story, but I've definitely noticed a trend in some AITA posts where the story is basically, \"person from marginalized group is being unreasonable and calling something I did racist/sexist/homophobic even though it clearly isn't, AITA?\" and then everyone in the comments piles in to say \"actually said racist/sexist/homophobic thing isn't real/doesn't matter/never happens\" so I do tend to take stories like this with a grain of salt.", "Silence racist"]}
