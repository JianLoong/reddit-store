She was a literal child when her parents got divorced.  And, yes, it would be nice for her to stick up for her step siblings, and make it clear that they matter to.  But reality says that that isn't necessarily the case.\n\nBlended families are complicated. It's not like you can force feelings where there are none, and the more you try, the worse it makes the situation.  \n\nOp isn't in the wrong for wanting her grandparents at her wedding more than she wants to start a fight.
