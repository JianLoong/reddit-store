Or 2 with your mom and 2 steps? Who are the grandparents not treating the same, their step grandchildren or their two younger biological grandchildren?", "Still it\u2019s not on her.  Dad could have stopped this long ago by going no contact if his bio children were not equally treated by his parents.  He didn\u2019t so why would she suddenly try to stop it. This has formed a close relationship to the grandparents.  He could have stopped this when they were kids and he did not. Then the favored kis growl up and he wants her to fix it. He basically doesn\u2019t want to ruin his relationship but wants her to ruin hers.  She should go to grands and say my dad wanted me to give you an ultimatum but I don\u2019t wanna. Of course wait til after the wedding.  Let the chaos fly between dad and them.  Yes I am petty!"]}
