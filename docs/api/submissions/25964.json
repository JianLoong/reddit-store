He us however 14, and 14yo kids are learning so if he has no way to gain forgiveness then you may be TA then. \nConsider a time period of taking the bus, or a requirement of cleaning your car in order to earn back your trust and his car rides.

Not in any way at all!!\n\nYou're not responsible, your step brother is responsible, he ignored your rules.  Your mom and stepdad should be sitting down with both of you and reinforce that it's your car, your rules.

You are allowed to set boundaries for your things. I am sure there are rules you have to follow while in their house, and if you broke them there would be consequences. You are doing the same thing with your car.\n\nMost young adults have to go through a transition period with boundary setting with their parents, you are doing it earlier.\n\nYou aren't responsible. Your step brother is 14. I know teenagers need more sleep, but we all went through it and got to school. I remember city buses where I lived didn't allow food or drinks on it.\n\nAfter a week, I would talk to him and let him know he will not be allowed in the car with food or drink. And he will have to find his own way (and be late).\nAnd he could have put the toast in a container and ate it could at school.\n\nGood luck!!! This isn't your fault", "Who cares I thought the kid ate your car.  Turns out he just ate in your car.  You\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA. It's not hard to put the toast in a bag and eat it when he gets to school. \n\nHe got away with it twice cos you were too nice and still expected to keep doing it without consequences, it doesn't work like that.", "NTA, your car your rules.", "NTA. You are teaching a child the consequences of not following the rules. This is a huge life lesson.\n\nHis parents can drive him or arrange a car pool (whom I think will also not want toast crumbs in their car).", "NTA. If your mom and stepdad want someone to drive their kid to school then they can do it.", "NTA\n\nYour rule is a reasonable one and easy to follow. 14 is old enough that ignoring your rule is deliberate disrespect.\n\nAFAIK kids aren\u2019t allowed to eat on the bus, either, but he probably gets away with it because the driver is too occupied.", "The kid's mom did NOT buy his car. His stepmom bought his car, and his mom is mad he won't give rides to HER stepson. NTA", "NTA, buses are great and they have AC.  unrelated question - this probably varies by state, but is it even legal for you as a 16-year-old to be driving around other minors?", "I\u2019m on the fence on this one, because you didn\u2019t buy the car.\n\nOn the one hand, I completely understand about wanting to keep your space clean, but on the other hand you\u2019re setting down some harsh rules for a vehicle you didn\u2019t pay for. \n\nI understand setting your boundaries and the gift being yours but your mom maybe wouldn\u2019t have paid for your car if she knew you\u2019d act like this.", "Why didn't you just take the food out of his hand or make him late.?  That would have made him a bit more organised.", "He can probably use a folder or skim textbook as a fan."]}
