Usually the party will consist of the children who competed, the coaches who coached that day, and the parents of the children who competed. When the check arrives, normally the parents will split the bill evenly and cover the cost of the 2 or 3 coaches. This has been the norm for years. Sometimes there is a kid without a parent or an extra assistant coach (who didn\u2019t coach) and we as the parents have covered their cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore recently, more people have joined our after event dinners. Kids without parents, former coaches, assistant coaches (who are not part of the coaching team that day), and random adult team members. The expectation being that the same group of parents will split the bill and cover the cost for the entire group. At one dinner, only myself and another parent showed up, and we had to split a $700 bill between the two of us. The other parent and I were really upset and after this, I voiced that the arrangement was not fair and I\u2019m not sure if it is a cultural thing, but next time I was going to voice that all of the \u201cextra\u201d people needed to pay their share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast night, was probably the largest group we have had. There was a large group of assistant coaches who showed up (who were not part of yesterdays sporting event), there were about 5 adult team members, and about 4 kids present without their parents. I will add that these parents know their kids are going to dinner and will drop them off at the restaurant, but will not send them with any funds. The adult and coaching group also ordered alcoholic drinks the entire night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen the bill came out close to $1.2k, I voiced to the other parents that we should ask all the adults (everyone except the coaches who coached yesterday) to pay their share of the bill and we can split what is leftover. This is where I think I became an asshole. The parents were uncomfortable asking the adult members to pay. The parents said since I only have one kid, to just pay his cost and they will take care of the rest. I told them that I want to pay for my share and help with the cost of the coaches that helped for the event to show my appreciation for them. I reiterated that I think it\u2019s unfair for us to have to cover the bill for the other adults, especially when they were drinking and expecting us to pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was shut down and the bill was paid. A few of the adults heard me and Venmo\u2019d their share. I paid $100 to cover the cost of my son and his coach (I showed up about halfway into the meal and did not eat).I woke up this morning and I feel so crummy about all of it. I probably should not have insisted on splitting the bill, if the other parents were willing to cover the cost of everyone. I feel like I forced my indignation on the parent group.

This is a horrible system. It sounds like most parents are dropping their kids off because they don\u2019t want to have to pay for a bunch of people. I\u2019d honestly just stop going and give my kid enough cash to cover their own meal.\n\nEdit: how many parents split the thousand dollar bill?", "NTA, dont show up for the next couple of these and watch the drama unfold, this has gotten way out of hand.", "NTA - The whole idea has gotten so far out of hand at this point with extra kids, parents, coaches and God knows who else to worm their way onto the gravy train.  What needs to be done is to dial back to its original purpose.   It needs to be firmly announced that the dinner for the kids that competed that day and their parents and their immediate coaches that coached that day with the bill to just those people paid for by the parents.  White you welcome all other extra to come if they wish, they have to buy their food.  You can have a color band ID to enforce.", "NTA\n\nPeople are taking advantage of the goodwill of the parents.  They don\u2019t deserve to just show up and eat and drink on your dime.", "NTA. This \u201ctradition\u201d has gotten out of hand, and people are definitely taking advantage of your generosity. The time to address this is how, however, not at the next event. You must have some sort of team email list or similar. It\u2019s 100% okay to describe how this issue has grown and gotten unfair to you and the other parents who pay. \n\nWhat\u2019s with the adult coaches behaving like this???? All adults should pay their own way at these dinners. An end of the season gift for the actual coaches is the way to go.", "NTA - I know it\u2019s embarrassing but *someone* needed to point out how ridiculous this was getting. And the extra people were counting on that to keep the gravy train going and keep getting free meals. All the adults (aside from actual coaches) should help pay, and also make sure extra kids show with something to contribute.\n\nGoodness, what would happen if only 1 parent showed up?? Would they really expect you to pay 100 percent of an astronomical bill and see nothing wrong with that?", "NTA\n\nThat is well out of order by the other parents.\n\nYou did the right thing only paying your kids part of the bill.", "Stop having the dinner and switch to a potluck - maybe a picnic. What is happening now is insane", "NTA. Yeah, this has gotten *absolutely* bonkers. Time to set down some rules that should be agreed to by all parents / adults or there are no more of these group outings. Something like parents may contribute to the coaches bill and cover children who don't have parents and got rides with others, but all other adults must pay for their own bill, and parents dropping their kids off should supply them with enough money to cover their food. If that child does not have money with them, the parents will be billed / venmo requested for the cost of the meal. Or something / stuff like that.", "NTA some traditions start with good intentions and just get out of hand. this is too big to be splitting amongst a small group. I know it\u2019s not easy to be the one saying it. But the alternative is that no parent will want to show up because it will cost them 1k! I think it\u2019s time to dial back to just kids and the coaches for that date.", "NTA. This system is convoluted and I\u2019d bring up doing a potluck or just not go.", "NTA.  There are a group of entitled leeches who have wiggled their way into free food and drinks.  The whole thing needs to be overhauled with set rules.", "Nta.  People are taking advantage of the situation and counting on others to pay.  It's sucks that so many people are being greedy and selfish.  You can only control yourself and your kid though. So perhaps an email  to everyone or just the coaches and parents letting them know that for future dinners you are only paying for your kid and a portion of that days coaches.  What other parents do with their money is their business.  Hopefully they will follow your lead though.", "NTA.  I coached my kids for 15 years or so.  I would start when they were young.  I always told my parents they were responsible for themselves and their kids if we went out or after games.  No parent bringing snacks after games for team.   \nWe always went to eat during tournaments or long trips for games.  Never had any parents complain and lots liked how they didn't have to provide for everyone.", "NTA for not participating in that, but if the other adults choose to cover the others, then that's on them.\n\nIt seems really stupid they'd rather spend hundreds than just tell the adults they're expected to pay for their own, but at the point they *tell you* they'll cover it, your obligation ends there.\n\nThere's a point you just have to wash your hands of the tradition. It seems like, either through the coaches talking, or the kids mentioning it, your semi-small tradition has become a free meal for anyone who wants to show up.", "NTA, and.....QUIT going.", "NTA \n\nAt this point people are showing up for a free meal and dropping their kids off for the same reason. You need to tell them this system isn\u2019t working anymore because people are taking advantage of the appreciation being shown.", "This is ridiculous... You gotta stop this", "I'd start asking for a separate check.  I can't afford $250 to take my own family to dinner.", "NTA. Shut that the heck down.", "You\u2019re out of you\u2019re mind to split a bill of $700 with one other parent!  And then to have more people show up the next time and the bill was over $1000!?!?\u2026.

First, you brought it up after everything was ordered and eaten. Second, the other parents were prepared to pay for everyone's meal, so essentially you butted in when it wasn't impacting you at that moment (since you and they agreed you could pay a smaller portion).

In general, the people who spend less should not have to subsidize the others who ate more, but it sounds like people are gaming the system for free meals.

Parents who send kids should send money with the kids and any extra coaches, extra kids other guests should pay their own way.  Time to change teams.

I've had my kids play travel sports for years and done the whole group dinner thing. We always paid for ourselves and our kids. Luckily the coaches all had kids on the team so this worked well. Occasionally if parents brought another player they covered the player and that kid parents payed the parents. On my son's current team, we have coaches that don't have kids on the team. Part of our team fee covers a per diem for those coaches. Expecting the team parents to pay for others who weren't coaching that day is incredibly entitled behavior.", "Perhaps bad timing but you are NTA.\n\nI see three problems that should be addressed.\n\nAdults who should pay their own way. These include anyone except the coaches that actively coached the kids that day. There is no reason that the parents need to be subsidizing these meals. From the OPs latest he added that some of these people had guests. It would be nice if these people contributed, but there is no reason that they would need to.\n\nParents dropping their kids off. These people are also taking advantage of your good nature. They have figured out the ultimate way to get their kid fed and avoid all responsibility for it. In my opinion, if your kid participates in the after-game dinner, then ese parents owe for their child and their share of the coach's meals.\n\nAlcohol. This can add up very quickly and some people seem to lose common sense on this. Not interested becomes, \"sure I'll have one\" if someone else is paying. Well drinks become top shelf. The $10 bottle of wine is now a $40 one. The only solution is separate checks on all alcohol. \n\nIt should be agreed up front exactly who the parents will be paying for and work with the restaurant on multiple checks.

Your alternatives are to just not go, become a leech parent and drop your kid of or go and continue to be the ATM.", "The bill was split between four parents (not counting myself, I paid $100)", "OP says, \"more recently\" ($700) and \"last night\" (\"$1.2K)...how freaking often are these parties happening? \n\nAnd we used to do pizza parties when I was a kid. Even if 40 adults and kids are there, where the heck are they going out to eat? Definitely not their local pizzeria because that's at least 60 pizzas.", "The other parents who are sick of paying are just dropping their kids off.  I suggest following suit but sending your kid with $ to contribute.  I expect the parents arguing with you are going to get sick of this soon.", "Yes, I accept that my timing was poor. I do want to clarify that I arrived to the dinner mid-meal (I did not eat) and when the check came out I was first asked to split the bill evenly. That was when I said we should ask the adults to pay their share and that I would be happy to split the cost of the remainder of the bill. \n\nThis is when I was told to pay only for my child and that they would pay the rest. I paid for my child and his coach.\n\nSeating wise, the parents were all seated at one table. The kids at another and the coaches and adults had their own table. One of the adults closest to me did hear my suggestion of having the adults pay. Her and her partner did end up venmo-ing and did contribute. \n\nLooking back I know that my insistence at the end was not helpful in the situation.", "Yeah, $250+ per person is brutal", "You should be Venmo-ing requests to every parent involved.
