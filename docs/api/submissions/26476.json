She got Leukima 4 years ago and it just ended up spreading throughout her body she fought very hard for a long time. Cancer is such a bitch I watched my poor baby suffer so much because of it. \n\nAnyway, since the loss of my daughter, a lot of people have been trying to comfort me and I understand they are just trying their best but it doesn't always help. My sister who doesn't have kids (a personal choice of hers) (f36) specifically has been the worst at trying to help me. A year ago she had to put down her 16 year old cat whom I lost a pet before so I know how difficult that can be but it's different than losing my actual human daughter. She has said things like I know how you feel about (daughter\u2019s name) because of the loss of (cat name) She was my child. I understand animals are like family but my daughter and her cat aren't the same. I was trying to just ignore her and let her comfort me with how she felt. \n\nBut today she came over and started talking about how she knows exactly how I feel because of her cat. I finally got upset and said no you don't, yes pets can be part of the family and mean a lot to you I understand losing your cat was hard. But my daughter was my daughter. So until you experience this type of grief and have to see your daughter die slowly from a horrible disease you aren't allowed to act like losing a cat is the same thing. My sister got mad and called me a heartless AH. I talked to a few people and they agreed that I acted like an AH\u2026 so am I", "created_utc": 1694206608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dlyt3/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_is_not_allowed_to/", "score": 923, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These are the things that I have learned on my 13 years of this forever journey.  \n\nThe difference is that a pet can be replaced,  no matter how much it hurts.  Dogs and cats have a short life.  A person, can never be replaced and that is what these fools do not understand.   \n\nThe loss of a child is the most horrific thing one can go through.  I've also learned how uncomfortable people are with death and they say incredibly stupid things as a result.\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Stick up for yourself whenever you are told such things.

I am still not over the loss of my infant daughter Hope. It is absolutely not the same, it is not equal, it is not even remotely acceptable to compare the 2. I was cringing typing this out.

It's not accurate. Pets are pets and your children are your children. People can love pets deeply, sure, and they can be wonderful companions, but looking after a pet is in no way comparable to the amount of time and sheer bloody effort and heartbreak it takes to grow and raise a child.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss OP, and that your sister is apparently an absolute dope. 100% NTA in this equation.", "I am so sorry for your tremendous loss.

You dropped her off at the bus stop for the first time. \n\nYou were supposed to see her graduate. Marry. Have kids. Make you a grandparent. I love my cat, but no way can you compare a cat dying of old age to a young girl dying long before her time. \n\nMake your sister and her friends read this. Then ask them what the hell is wrong with them. How insanely disrespectful to you and to your late daughter.", "NTA. You took it incredibly well the first time she said it but for her to bring it up again so soon is just odd.

So sorry for your loss, I cant imagine what youre going through but don't let others stupidity close you off to some doors of support.", "Nta. This happened to me too. My son died during his labor and delivery. He just got caught in his cord and strangled. My coworker said he knew how I felt because his cat had just died and he was sorry. This actually happened a lot. My sister said she knew what it was like because she had a miscarriage.

People are just oblivious and don't know what to say i think but its ok to say that it's inappropriate because it is.", "NTA. I have a daughter. I had a cat I loved. I miss him every day, but I'm still fundamentally the same person. Our human life expectancy makes it pretty certain that we'll outlive most of our pets.

I know if I lost a niece it would affect me more than losing my dearly loved pet.  Losing a pet is devastating but losing a family member has to be more.", "My deepest condolences. I have also lost a child. I too had people make those comparisons.  The pain is so deep it feels like you'll shatter. I often felt like I was drowning and not sure I could keep my head above water.  When you're ready, maybe find a grief support group. I'm not much of a \"group\" kind of person. But I found a grief group that was loss of a child, and it was really helpful. I didn't talk much, but just listening to others talk made me feel..... relieved maybe? I can't say better because nothing made it better.

I was a wreck after my dog passed away. But id gladly go through that 100 times over losing my child - especially over suspicion and beauracracy rather than actual truth.\n\nYour sister may well have had a connection and a bond with her cat.

She got Leukima 4 years ago and it just ended up spreading throughout her body she fought very hard for a long time. Cancer is such a bitch I watched my poor baby suffer so much because of it. \n\nAnyway, since the loss of my daughter, a lot of people have been trying to comfort me and I understand they are just trying their best but it doesn't always help. My sister who doesn't have kids (a personal choice of hers) (f36) specifically has been the worst at trying to help me. A year ago she had to put down her 16 year old cat whom I lost a pet before so I know how difficult that can be but it's different than losing my actual human daughter. She has said things like I know how you feel about (daughter\u2019s name) because of the loss of (cat name) She was my child. I understand animals are like family but my daughter and her cat aren't the same. I was trying to just ignore her and let her comfort me with how she felt. \n\nBut today she came over and started talking about how she knows exactly how I feel because of her cat. I finally got upset and said no you don't, yes pets can be part of the family and mean a lot to you I understand losing your cat was hard. But my daughter was my daughter. So until you experience this type of grief and have to see your daughter die slowly from a horrible disease you aren't allowed to act like losing a cat is the same thing.

Pets are very loveable, but the relationship is never the same as a human child. For example, I know the names of family members going back for generations, but not their pets. Also, when you buy a pet you expect to outlive it. This is never true of a child. \n\nThere's something incredibly narcissistic about believing that your relationship with your pet is the same as a child. With a child, a parent gives everything, mind, body, and spirit, and watches them grow into an independent human with real thoughts and emotions. But with an animal, the relationship is one sided.

Take a time out from your sister and anyone else who cannot support your grief in a meaningful way. Your daughter is a part of you, never to be forgotten.  The pain will never go away. BUT, if you take this time to fully grieve- cry, mourn, release the pain  as much as you can. Then, when you are ready, go through your house, her room and focus on belongings that bring you happy memories.  Choose a few. Enough to keep the good memories to the forefront.

I'm terribly sorry for the loss of your daughter. That's a pain I can't imagine. Speaking as a parent and a cat owner, I can't, in any way, compare one to the other. I love my cats, but I would die for my kids. If something happens to one of my cats, I can get another one after I grieve for a while. I can't replace my kids. Explaining the difference between your love for your kids and your love for a pet is hard for people who don't have children. It's like trying to describe a sunset to Stevie Wonder. He thinks he understands, but he doesn't. I'm sorry your sister hurt you like that, and I can kind of see where she's coming from. Unfortunately, she's Stevie in this one, and she really doesn't understand what she thinks she does. Damn, I hope that made sense. Again, my sincere condolences for the loss of your child.", "NTA.

The reason being those of us who are neurodivergent don\u2019t always know what to say, so sometimes making a connection with someone grieving or struggling is difficult. If losing her cat is the closest thing she\u2019s had to losing a child, that may be the only thing she can relate and rely on to try and comfort you. It can be incredibly difficult to just listen. She may be trying to tell you she understands\u2026 in the only way she knows how. And she may have become defensive because you\u2019ve just rejected her attempts at connection.

It\u2019s unfortunate that she can\u2019t take the hint that you need better support!", "Well it's certainly not exactly the same but to some people their \"pets\" ARE their children. The life expectancy of a cat is just much shorter than that of a human so you're already supposed to expect to outlive your child in that case. Definitely not the same as a human child where they typically outlive their parents. The grief can certainly be similar though if you see your pet as your child.", "Man, my honest opinion is yes, you're the AH. I say this because, I understand that, yes, a cat is not the same as a human. But, when a person loses a loved one, whether it's a pet. That loss to me is still the same. You are losing a  loved one that you have memories of. Even if it is a pet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel oftentimes when a person does say \"I agree with what you are feeling and that I too lost someone (a pet)\". In your grief, you are thinking that they are trying to say that your child is an animal. When in fact what they are saying is, \"I empathize with you because I too have lost a loved one.\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink about it like this. If a person lost their pet due to cancer. Would you still have the same feeling? Or would you agree with them that cancer sucks?", "NAH\n\nI don\u2019t think either of you are assholes. \n\nOne of the biggest differences with losing a pet is that we NEVER expect to outlive them. We know they will die before us. It\u2019s the opposite with children - parents expect that they will die before their child. \n\nYour sister is doing her best. It\u2019s not what you need or want, but she loves you and this is the closest she can relate. \n\nPutting my childhood cat down was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. It\u2019s been almost 20 years and I still cry over her and have dreams that wake me up and make me cry. I put her down as my parents basically forced me too and I\u2019ve never forgave them for it. \n\nMy brother lost his daughter recently. I loved her dearly and am very much grieving her. I loved her as close as I could get to loving someone like my child. I\u2019m childfree. \n\nWhen talking to my brother I don\u2019t mention those things because I know it hits different for him. If I did, and he said something like what you said to your sister, I would also be extremely hurt and might not forgive him. Putting my cat down felt like murder and I am still very much grieving her. \n\nGrief can\u2019t really be compared. No one can really say one persons grief is more than another\u2019s. Lots of people would tell me that grief over losing a grandparent would be worse than grief over a pet - both you expect to outlive them. But even there - I didn\u2019t really give a shit when either of my grandparents died, like I didn\u2019t shed a single tear. But my cat I still cry over 20 years later - I loved her deeply. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, and that your sister isn\u2019t supporting you the way you want.

As a 28f who has finally truly accepted I will be CF by choice and very likely a \u201czoo mama\u201d (I just want lots of animals, not a literal zoo), I find it pretty insulting to compare children to pets.
