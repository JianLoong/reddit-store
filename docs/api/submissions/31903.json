I don\u2019t want to give too  many of \u201cthose guys\u201d the benefit of the doubt but at the same time I often wonder for guys (or really anyone) who are heavy handed, persistent, won\u2019t take no for an answer etc how many of them actually know what they\u2019re doing is wrong and they just don\u2019t care, vs. how many have just received bad advice, coddling or even coercion like this from parents or other people who just don\u2019t know better. Since a lot of those guys also seem to not see anything wrong with that kind of approach.", "My parents are 60&61 and that attitude belonged to their parent's not them. I'm 31.

That\u2019s the mindset from the 50s", "The worst example I ever personally saw of this were parents at a daycare I worked at. The dad had *stalked* the mom and after a while she finally decided to just give in and go on a date so he would leave her alone. \n\nShe somehow married this guy. \n\nThings were obviously not ok because their child had some really severe behavioral issues.

I'm old enough to have a 19 year old child. I was born in 1984. That's absolutely no excuse for mom's behaviour.", "{waggles hand} It was also just part of the social game at the time. Women were pressured to not seem too eager, which meant that they expected men to ask more than once, to show their seriousness. It is funny how things change, though. My parents, now in their 70s, were agog at how many people were going steady in our high school. When they were growing up, their parents actually didn't allow them to date the same person twice in a row in high school, since the thought was that you shouldn't be getting that serious about dating, but rather getting out and meeting people.", "Mostly, but I still hear a ton of stories like that from people aged 45+. Like I feel most people who were teens before the mid 90s have somewhat antiquated views of dating. For example, surveys show the majority of men under 35 say they refuse to approach a woman in public bc they\u2019re scared of being interpreted as creepy. All I\u2019m saying is that the past 5-15 years has changed a lot of things when it comes to what behaviors in dating are socially acceptable, so if his mom has been out of the game for 20+ years, she might not understand. Plus there\u2019s also the possibility that her parents had a story like that and she grew up thinking it was romantic. I'm just saying it could be a bit more complex than just \"how would you feel if this happened to you\" bc she might think it's sweet, like Jim and Pam from the office or something.", "I'm 38, and I can remember all the movies in the late 90s in which persistent flirting and wearing down was considered cute and heartwarming. \n\nIt's still not acceptable, but it was a lot more recent than people like to think", "No, that mindset lasted much longer than your grandparents' generation.  It was certainly very common in the 80's-90's.", "I'm old enough to have a 22-year-old grandson, and I think his mom's idea is atrocious.", "I was born in 90 - my generation is pretty f'd too in terms of 'respect'", "Sorry, I'm in my 40s and this is just not true. AT ALL! Sure, dating standards and traditions may have changed, but folks born in the 80s were not taught to be persistent and ask someone out multiple times or turn someone down and make them chase them. That was OUR parents' generation and they're all in their 60s and 70s now.", "Part of the difference is those of us who faced down what society (read, the patriarchy that we all lived under) thought was right back in those \"good old days.\"   It's hard to undo that conditioning (OP's mom seems to be a good example of that) - men pestering you and not giving up in the face of you saying no is NOT a compliment.   My mom was born in the early 30s, but I swear she came out of the womb with a bra in one hand and a match in the other, and she taught me well :)", "I'm 39 and I remember those movies and thinking how cute and sweet they were when I was a teenager. Now they kind of give me the ick because I know that's not acceptable. Obviously OP's mom didn't have the same thought process as she got older.", "And keep in mind that those 90s teens were 80s kids who were told that boys bullied girls on the playground because they liked them.", "No it absolutely was not.

Good on you for maintaining healthy boundaries with your friend and respecting her decision, and not making her or yourself uncomfortable by making things unnecessarily awkward. Your mom could take a lesson from you in social maturity.", "NTA.  Haha... your dad is smart!", "NTA, mom doesn't get to make decisions about anyone else's relationships. Tell her she's overstepping her bounds just as you would be if you didn't respect the \"No\" and that's what consent is all about. Thanks for having respect for your friend BTW.", "NTA! In my opinion, any advances after being rejected are just harassment at that point. So basically your mom is insisting you harass this girl when she really just needs a tutor. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019ll never happen, just tread lightly. If it\u2019s gonna happen, she\u2019s gotta make the next move. I mean\u2026 my WIFE turned me down when I first asked her out so you never know.", "NTA. It would be inappropriate to make a move when she clearly said no, and you're mom should respect that.", "NTA. Your mom's advice is creepy.

She said no. End of. To harass her would make you a creep. What is your mother thinking? \n\nNTA", "NTA. I'm so proud of you actually for the way you handled it.", "NTA\n\nwhat's really fucked up about this is that your mother wants you to disrespect a known boundary so she can benefit from it not caring about the impact it will have on you or her fantasy DIL.", "NTA.  You did the gentlemanly thing and took no for an answer without making a big deal out of it. Your mother should be so, so proud of you.  I would be in her place.  Stick to your guns on this one.  You're doing the right thing.", "You're not the asshole in this situation because you're respecting your friendship. What Your mother is talking about is essentially sexual harassment and if your friend reports you for flirting with her during your tutoring sessions, you could get into serious trouble. Tell your mother to back off, that your friendship is very important to you and you don't want to compromise it just because she wants something different. If she tries to approach your friend shut her down and tell her to knock it off because she's not respecting you and she certainly is not respecting your friend's decision. Best of luck to all of you!", "NTA, Ha I totally understand others saying your mom needs to chill, and she does, but your dad gave good advice. I guess they don't fight much, and probably because he follows the same advice he gave you. Wise words from pops.", "NTA. Don't present your mother with a daughter-in-law until you're much, much older. And don't hit on people who are reliant on you in some way, like employees, students, and people you're tutoring.

She said no, you were respectful, that should have been the end of it.", "NTA, your mom is trying to turn you into a creep.  Thats fucking weird.  Toss a chaos grenade and call it a day: tell your sister and the friend what your mom is pushing and let them explain to her how weird it is.", "NTA - this is so weird of your mom to be trying to force you to be with a person that already rejected you once", "NTA - she said no, you respected her no and it sounds like y'all stayed friendly if not actual friends. You were right to shut it down because if Mom had said something thinking she was creating a chance that would have created a really awkward situation for you and your sister's friend. Good job!", "NTA. Ultimately, this impacts YOU. It doesn't matter what your mom wants. You need to be clear on who you want to be with, and if it isn't your sister's friend, that is just fine.", "Eeew. That would be the end of tutoring, AND the end of the friendship.", "NTA - you're respecting your friend's boundaries. Kudos to you for that! Your mom should really follow your example.", "NTA.

False hope may make his life easier when it comes to dealing with your mom, but it's actually worse overall than no hope. Worse for her, worse for you, worse for this girl.
