{"id": 13619, "submission_id": "127dxpx", "title": "AITA for telling my best friend that I'm never baking for her ever again?", "selftext": "I (20F) started baking in the quarantine as a hobby, just to pass time. Over time, my skills have significantly improved, and I've started taking orders from people (occasionally, as I'm still a student and don't have too much time to invest in it full time). However, whenever an important occasion is coming up for my loved ones, I bake them a cake for free. I do this of my own free will, because it makes me happy. \n\nA week ago, it was my best friend, Zia's 23rd birthday. This would be the last birthday we'd be celebrating together as I'm moving overseas shortly for further education. So, I went all out and made two themed cakes. One of them was a huge butterscotch and caramel cake, decorated with all her favourite colours (pink and white) and  very fancy decorations. The other one was a Lotus Biscoff Cheesecake, which is her absolute favourite dessert. On the day of her birthday, we cut the cake, and she gave us all one slice each from the Biscoff Cheesecake (only 3 of us apart from her). Later on, she texted me that she loved the cake so much and is kind of sad that she got to only eat 3/4th of it and wants a whole cake to herself. I told her I'd make it for her again someday. \n\nYesterday was my father's birthday. I made two Lotus Biscoff cheesecakes for him. The only reason I made it was because I had too many ingredients left over from the last time I made it, and because he doesn't like buttercream or whipped cream frosted cakes, and prefers cheesecakes or sponge cakes to them. I posted the photos on my baking account on Instagram, and Zia saw them. I immediately got a phone call that she wanted one of the cakes. I told her they were for my dad, and I'd make another one for her later on. However she kept insisting, and wouldn't let it go. I caved in and told her to come today and pick up the cake. Obviously, I couldn't give her the entire cake, I'd made it for my dad, and for the rest of the family. So I cut up 3 medium sized slices for her and boxed them up. When Zia saw them, she immediately asked me why I hadn't packed up the whole cake for her. I explained to her that I couldn't do that because it was for my dad, and the rest of my family. She started her little rant again about how she couldn't get her birthday cake to herself because she had to share with us, and how she's owed a whole cheesecake. She then asked me if I'd make her another one next week, and I told her I couldn't spend time making another cake because of my upcoming exams. This pissed her off and she said that I don't even share a good relationship with my father so she finds it ridiculous that I'm doing so much for him.\n\nThis was a low blow, and ticked me off. I told her to never expect another cake from me again. Now I'm petty, selfish and a bad friend.

You did something nice for her, she ruined it with her entitlement.\n\nIt's very normal when you have a birthday party with a birthday cake that, surprisingly, the guests also get some of the cake. I don't think I've ever heard of someone getting their own cake for their birthday that no one else at the party eats. If she wants another cake, she can buy herself another cake. You already went out of your way for her giving her three extra slices, and she chooses to attack your relationship with your father.\n\nYou're right that she should never get another cake from you again- nor another text message, phone call, hangout, etc..\n\nThe best thing I think you can do for yourself here is let her entitlement ruin your friendship with her.", "Wow. Clear NTA. \nShes delusional for thinking youre her personal chef and expecting you to whip up cakes as and when she fancies. \nYou were beyond generous for baking her two cakes and even offering some from your dad's cake, THAT TOO FOR FREE. \n\nI bake sometimes too, and I know the time, patience and effort it takes to do that. Id suggest baking one more and treating yourself to it!\n\nEdit to add: You should rethink having her as a 'best friend' when all she sees you as is a source of free food.", "Absolutely NTA.

She seems she's just using you in that sense and not really caring about you in that moment, basically taking it for granted. Also you are very generous to even give her some cake slices from your dads cake, she should appreciate that and not ask for a whole cake, even though she knows, that you baked it for another person. I think it's better if she doesn't get anymore free cake in the future, maybe then she starts to appreciate what you doing.", "WTF is going on in this post? Who out there is demanding an entire cake be made for them (for free) when TWO cakes were supplied? Is she eating them or paving a driveway?

Who cares if its your best friend. They have no right to be mad at you for not doing free labour. NTA.", "NTA. NOBODY gets a whole birthday cake to themselves.

People like this you need to block and if any of your other friends take her side block them too. Nobody deserves to be take advantage of. The comment she made about your Dad was insightful. She let you know in those words that she was more important than your Father.

It's just me and my husband and the slices are big enough to split. Who the hell can eat an ENTIRE cake alone before it goes stale?", "I was in a slightly similar situation near the end of my college years. I kept the same roommates for 3-4 years and considered them to be my best friends too, but looking back they never treated me with the same respect I showed them. \n\nI\u2019m nowhere near the baker you are, but I often baked or just made nice meals for myself because it was something I enjoyed. I would always share some of my food with my roommates, giving up the leftovers that would\u2019ve been my meals later in the week when I had less free time. They\u2019d pretty much always come into the kitchen when they realized it was me cooking and it became default for me to share out of habit, though I never accepted their food (mostly because it was all microwaved frozen foods or instant ramen.)\n\nThen, they started making more friends I wasn\u2019t a fan of (constantly at our house and using the things I was happy to share with people I actually knew.) They\u2019d take my kitchen utensils or tupperware items home and I\u2019d never see them again. But what really broke the camel\u2019s back was when my roommates started offering my food to their friends. \n\nAt first I said sure, have this small piece, just to keep the peace with my roommates. But then it got to a point where I\u2019d make myself a nice dinner that I know will provide leftovers for a few days, and I\u2019d go to pack it up once it had cooled down to find 75% of it gone. \n\nAgain, trying to maintain a peaceful house, I didn\u2019t say anything to my \u2018friends\u2019 and just started packing up my food as soon as it was done being made before eating alone in my room. It didn\u2019t take long for them to start asking why I didn\u2019t leave my food out to share anymore and I explained that I was a broke college student, broker than them, and I can\u2019t afford to give away my food to their friends. \n\nAnyways, sorry for the long story. To end it shorter, once they realized that I wasn\u2019t going to be providing them their nightly meals and share with their friends, I started to see their true selves come out. (Along with several other details I\u2019m omitting) they would basically ignore me where before we\u2019d spend most nights talking and hanging out. \n\nReally sucks that you can\u2019t just include people in things you enjoy without worrying about the future consequences"]}
