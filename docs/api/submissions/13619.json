{"id": 13619, "submission_id": "127dxpx", "title": "AITA for telling my best friend that I'm never baking for her ever again?", "selftext": "I (20F) started baking in the quarantine as a hobby, just to pass time. Over time, my skills have significantly improved, and I've started taking orders from people (occasionally, as I'm still a student and don't have too much time to invest in it full time). However, whenever an important occasion is coming up for my loved ones, I bake them a cake for free. I do this of my own free will, because it makes me happy. \n\nA week ago, it was my best friend, Zia's 23rd birthday. This would be the last birthday we'd be celebrating together as I'm moving overseas shortly for further education. So, I went all out and made two themed cakes. One of them was a huge butterscotch and caramel cake, decorated with all her favourite colours (pink and white) and  very fancy decorations. The other one was a Lotus Biscoff Cheesecake, which is her absolute favourite dessert. On the day of her birthday, we cut the cake, and she gave us all one slice each from the Biscoff Cheesecake (only 3 of us apart from her). Later on, she texted me that she loved the cake so much and is kind of sad that she got to only eat 3/4th of it and wants a whole cake to herself. I told her I'd make it for her again someday. \n\nYesterday was my father's birthday. I made two Lotus Biscoff cheesecakes for him. The only reason I made it was because I had too many ingredients left over from the last time I made it, and because he doesn't like buttercream or whipped cream frosted cakes, and prefers cheesecakes or sponge cakes to them. I posted the photos on my baking account on Instagram, and Zia saw them. I immediately got a phone call that she wanted one of the cakes. I told her they were for my dad, and I'd make another one for her later on. However she kept insisting, and wouldn't let it go. I caved in and told her to come today and pick up the cake. Obviously, I couldn't give her the entire cake, I'd made it for my dad, and for the rest of the family. So I cut up 3 medium sized slices for her and boxed them up. When Zia saw them, she immediately asked me why I hadn't packed up the whole cake for her. I explained to her that I couldn't do that because it was for my dad, and the rest of my family. She started her little rant again about how she couldn't get her birthday cake to herself because she had to share with us, and how she's owed a whole cheesecake. She then asked me if I'd make her another one next week, and I told her I couldn't spend time making another cake because of my upcoming exams. This pissed her off and she said that I don't even share a good relationship with my father so she finds it ridiculous that I'm doing so much for him.\n\nThis was a low blow, and ticked me off. I told her to never expect another cake from me again. Now I'm petty, selfish and a bad friend according to her messages.

You did something nice for her, she ruined it with her entitlement.\n\nIt's very normal when you have a birthday party with a birthday cake that, surprisingly, the guests also get some of the cake. I don't think I've ever heard of someone getting their own cake for their birthday that no one else at the party eats. If she wants another cake, she can buy herself another cake. You already went out of your way for her giving her three extra slices, and she chooses to attack your relationship with your father.\n\nYou're right that she should never get another cake from you again- nor another text message, phone call, hangout, etc..\n\nThe best thing I think you can do for yourself here is let her entitlement ruin your friendship with her.", "Wow. Clear NTA. \nShes delusional for thinking youre her personal chef and expecting you to whip up cakes as and when she fancies. \nYou were beyond generous for baking her two cakes and even offering some from your dad's cake, THAT TOO FOR FREE. \n\nI bake sometimes too, and I know the time, patience and effort it takes to do that. Id suggest baking one more and treating yourself to it!\n\nEdit to add: You should rethink having her as a 'best friend' when all she sees you as is a source of free food.", "Absolutely NTA. This \u201cfriend\u201d is literally trying to have her cake and eat it too. You were right to cut her off.", "NTA, your best friend sounds ridiculous-", "NTA\n\nyou're too busy, you're being generous and you're really good at making things like this and you're giving it for her for free?  \n\n\nIt's prolly not worth giving her anymore because I think she's in the levels of being ~~entitled~~ now.\n\nEdit To Add: if you're still friends with her, even after reading this, why though?", "NTA, your friend is not entitled to your baking especially since you do it for free. She seems she's just using you in that sense and not really caring about you in that moment, basically taking it for granted. Also you are very generous to even give her some cake slices from your dads cake, she should appreciate that and not ask for a whole cake, even though she knows, that you baked it for another person. I think it's better if she doesn't get anymore free cake in the future, maybe then she starts to appreciate what you doing.", "WTF is going on in this post? Who out there is demanding an entire cake be made for them (for free) when TWO cakes were supplied? Is she eating them or paving a driveway? Like how is it physically possible to eat that much cake yourself?\n\nAssuming this is real, NTA, stop being a doormat for this cartoon villain person.", "Did she ever once offer to pay for the cake? Who cares if its your best friend. They have no right to be mad at you for not doing free labour. NTA.", "NTA. NOBODY gets a whole birthday cake to themselves. They are meant to share with friends. \n\nBut in the future she may not have any so she\u2019ll probably have to buy a cake all for herself.", "NTA. She is not a big loss. And in the future, you don't have to be that nice. People who want your cake and ask should pay you. Ingredients are not free.", " NTA. She didn\u2019t pay for the cakes and now she\u2019s complaining about not getting a whole cake to herself. You don\u2019t OWE her anything. People like this you need to block and if any of your other friends take her side block them too. Nobody deserves to be take advantage of. The comment she made about your Dad was insightful. She let you know in those words that she was more important than your Father. I would call her and ask her if she wants to join the \u201cblock party?\u201d When she\u2019s asks you what that is or where you hang up the phone and block her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd be totally happy with 3/4 cheesecake or even one slice. It sounds amazing.", "NTA. That lady is being incredibly entitled. I think you handled the situation perfectly reasonably.", "This is not a friend. Be glad they outed themselves over something as petty as a slice of cake. Run for the hills with all your baking skills. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nShe's an entitled little so and so. I would suggest you let the 'friendship' die since you are leaving soon anyway. \n\nKeep baking for the people who see it as a gift not an entitlement.", "Nta I got mad reading this. The absolute entitlement is off the charts. She\u2019s not being a good friend to you at all.", "Your friend is a delusional clown. You went out of your way to do a nice thing already and she asks for her like she\u2019s entitled to it? NTA.", "NTA. Entitled former friend (raging bitch energy) got told no and threw a tempertantrum fuck her go NC and cut the toxic out of your life.", "NTA. That isn't a friend. Stick to your promise.", "NTA.  She sounds greedy and entitled", "Why does she need a whole cake? Sounds like she has an eating disorder (along with other psychological problems)", "NTA - Please tell me you didn\u2019t give her the slices after how she treated you?", "She originally only wanted to share the caramel butterscotch cake, and keep the cheesecake for herself. But 2 of our friends wanted to taste the cheesecake, and she had to share. I think it's very childish still, but I don't know if I should be this petty and mad over it.", "I don't think you are being petty in the slightest. You are simply seeing and upholding a boundary. It is 100% her own fault for crossing the boundary and believing you owe her. First of all, nobody owes anyone anything when the thing is a gift to begin with. Second of all, the entitlement to even ask for more from someone else cake is ridiculous. Whatever you do, OP, do not ever make her a cake again. Stick by your word. If you lose her as a friend over this, she wasn't truly a friend to begin with. NTA", "Ah, I probably misread. It's pretty late for me, I'm about to go to sleep.\n\nI still don't think you're being petty at all, though. Her response was completely out of proportion and inappropriate for the scenario, and it's totally rational for you to be this upset that she sunk to those levels over some cake.", "NTA\n\nYour friend is a greedy little pig. Who TF demands an entire cake all for themselves.", "NTA. I don't think I've seen anyone demand an entire birthday cake to themselves once they pass the age of, say, 3. Are you sure Zia isn't turning 3 instead of *23*?\n\nPlus just the *AUDACITY* to see that you posted a photo of the two cheesecakes and - somehow - DEMAND one of them. Like, how did the thought not enter her head that maybe they weren't for her? If you'd made them for her, wouldn't you have tagged her (or however it works on social media, I'm old) or texted her or otherwise TOLD HER that the cheesecakes were for her?\n\nAnd then doubling down on the audacity to critique/shit on your relationship with your father? That is NONE of her business either way.\n\nI'm legit mad for you. I'd want to make a Lotus Biscoff cheesecake (which I had to google, and to be fair they DO look delicious) and I'd be like \"Oh Zia, this one is for you!\" Then when she came over, I'd smorsh it into her face. XD", "NTA. Who on earth would just say \"Give me your dad's cake!\"? I don't even know where to start with that.", "NTA, she got 2 free cakes and still demands more? No, she can pay for the additional cake.", "NTA\n\nYou offered her to make another cake at a future point, and if she wanted it before she could have asked you nicely if you had the time and maybe even offered to pay for the ingredients to make it. \n\nYou were extremely generous when you offered her some of your fathers birthday cake, and the facts that she then still felt that it was her right to complain that she did not get a whole cake... In my experience people will stretch pretty far if you smile and ask nicely and the thing is reasonable. This was neigther, so very much no more cake for her.", "NTA\n\nWtf thinks that you get a whole birthday (cheese)cake to yourself? Maybe it\u2019s different in other places, but I\u2019ve always known that you share your birthday cake with others, that\u2019s the point of it.", "NTA block her. Her level of entitlement has gone into crazy. She'd destroy her friendship with you for cake", "NTA.\nYou sound like a great baker, and generous to a fault. It\u2019s a shame your friend is such a greedy and ungrateful ass.", "NTA\n\nBlock the ungrateful moron.", "What kind of greedy selfish person demands somebody else birthday cake, I would of told her greedy arse to get the f out my house and show her directions to the nearest asda", "NTA. I would have taken the 3 slices back after what she said.", "NTA.  Your so-called friend was out of line.  She's like, oh, you can't do something for me, so I'll shoot a low blow comment to you.  Good riddance, and I wouldn't give her a Twinkie.", "Who is she to determine your relationship with your father?\n\nWho have a whole cake to themselves during birthdays? \nNTA. You can tell her to piss off and bake her own. \n\nShe don\u2019t deserve a friend like you.", "NTA.

No. You're a friend who did *two* nice baking things for her, not her cake maid.\n\nNo more cake for her!\n\nNTA", "Even with everything else going on here, a birthday cake is for sharing\nNTA", "NTA.

She's greedy, inconsiderate, and a bad friend.", "If I want an entire cake to myself (which I would eat through out the week), I go out and buy it with money...not demand it for free from bakers I know. There is nothing wrong with wanting an entire cake to yourself but demanding it and throwing a tantrum when you didn't get it is utterly ridiculous.\n\nNTA but she is. If she wants this cake so bad, then she should have no problem making it herself.

So according to her, I could give one to her. Because it's her favourite cake. I don't know what to say but that she thinks her behaviour is cute. She's always been this way.", "Yo I love my cheesecake (and have the body to prove it) and I could not get through an entire cheesecake by myself before it went bad. Your \"friend\" is greedy af. Holy shit. Do not enable her selfishness and bad relationship with food. NTA.", "I don't see you as being petty. You made a something for your father, and then she came over and demanded you give it to her instead. She's showing her true colors to you. Don't ignore them.\n\nThat is pure selfishness/narcissism/immaturity/whatever.", "I was gonna say it sounds pretty greedy.", "Man, my full-level petty would offer to make her any cake except her favorite. Like, so close but so far. But she's shown she's not worth the cost of ingredients, let alone your labor."]}
