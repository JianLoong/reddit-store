{"id": 13619, "submission_id": "127dxpx", "title": "AITA for telling my best friend that I'm never baking for her ever again?", "selftext": "I (20F) started baking in the quarantine as a hobby, just to pass time. Over time, my skills have significantly improved, and I've started taking orders from people (occasionally, as I'm still a student and don't have too much time to invest in it full time). However, whenever an important occasion is coming up for my loved ones, I bake them a cake for free. I do this of my own free will, because it makes me happy. \n\nA week ago, it was my best friend, Zia's 23rd birthday. This would be the last birthday we'd be celebrating together as I'm moving overseas shortly for further education. So, I went all out and made two themed cakes. One of them was a huge butterscotch and caramel cake, decorated with all her favourite colours (pink and white) and  very fancy decorations. The other one was a Lotus Biscoff Cheesecake, which is her absolute favourite dessert. On the day of her birthday, we cut the cake, and she gave us all one slice each from the Biscoff Cheesecake (only 3 of us apart from her). Later on, she texted me that she loved the cake so much and is kind of sad that she got to only eat 3/4th of it and wants a whole cake to herself. I told her I'd make it for her again someday. \n\nYesterday was my father's birthday. I made two Lotus Biscoff cheesecakes for him. The only reason I made it was because I had too many ingredients left over from the last time I made it, and because he doesn't like buttercream or whipped cream frosted cakes, and prefers cheesecakes or sponge cakes to them. I posted the photos on my baking account on Instagram, and Zia saw them. I immediately got a phone call that she wanted one of the cakes. I told her they were for my dad, and I'd make another one for her later on. However she kept insisting, and wouldn't let it go. I caved in and told her to come today and pick up the cake. Obviously, I couldn't give her the entire cake, I'd made it for my dad, and for the rest of the family. So I cut up 3 medium sized slices for her and boxed them up. When Zia saw them, she immediately asked me why I hadn't packed up the whole cake for her. I explained to her that I couldn't do that because it was for my dad, and the rest of my family. She started her little rant again about how she couldn't get her birthday cake to herself because she had to share with us, and how she's owed a whole cheesecake. She then asked me if I'd make her another one next week, and I told her I couldn't spend time making another cake because of my upcoming exams. This pissed her off and she said that I don't even share a good relationship with my father so she finds it ridiculous that I'm doing so much for him.\n\nThis was a low blow, and ticked me off. I told her to never expect another cake from me again. Now I'm petty, selfish and a bad friend.

I don't think I've ever heard of someone getting their own cake for their birthday that no one else at the party eats. If she wants another cake, she can buy herself another cake. You already went out of your way for her giving her three extra slices, and she chooses to attack your relationship with your father.\n\nYou're right that she should never get another cake from you again- nor another text message, phone call, hangout, etc..\n\nThe best thing I think you can do for yourself here is let her entitlement ruin your friendship with her.", "Wow. Clear NTA. \nShes delusional for thinking youre her personal chef and expecting you to whip up cakes as and when she fancies. \nYou were beyond generous for baking her two cakes and even offering some from your dad's cake, THAT TOO FOR FREE. \n\nI bake sometimes too, and I know the time, patience and effort it takes to do that.

She seems she's just using you in that sense and not really caring about you in that moment, basically taking it for granted. Also you are very generous to even give her some cake slices from your dads cake, she should appreciate that and not ask for a whole cake, even though she knows, that you baked it for another person.

People like this you need to block and if any of your other friends take her side block them too. Nobody deserves to be take advantage of. The comment she made about your Dad was insightful. She let you know in those words that she was more important than your Father.

She thought it was the funniest thing in the world. Then thought I was crazy because I got so mad. Just one example of several from this woman.", "I have to ask, does she have an ED or is she possibly obese? Bc I can't see anyone with a healthy relationship with food wanting an entire CHEESECAKE to themselves. I can pack in some pastries and baked goods, but I can't imagine eating a cake that size by myself before it went bad.", "NTA.  It's your call on if she stays your BFF.  But just tell her the cake is special and you will only make it for her once a year tops.  \n\nMy Wife used to make a special cake for her BFF.  She probably did it for twenty years.  Last year her BFF basically couldn't be bothered to even get her a present for Christmas, even though my Wife is one of her kid's godmothers and has bought presents for all three of her kids for over 20 years. \n\nWife decided the cake was too much work this year and now the BFF doesn't want to do presents next year.", "You were beyond generous for baking her two cakes and even offering some from your dad's cake, THAT TOO FOR FREE.", "You were right to cut her off.", "She doesn't have an ED. She didn't eat the cheesecake in one day, but over 3 days. She's otherwise very condescending about eating habits (I gained a bit of weight the last few years due to stress, and she wouldn't stop commenting and cracking awful hurtful jokes). There's a lot of unfinished business there. Everytime I start talking about her, I keep realising how hurtful she can be.", "Is she eating them or paving a driveway? Like how is it physically possible to eat that much cake yourself?", "I'm so sorry you're having to process this, but it really does sound like it's far overdue. She's definitely some easy weight to shed.", "She doesn\u2019t sound like she deserves the title of best friend. At least it\u2019ll make moving away that much easier for you."]}
