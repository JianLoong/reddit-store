James and I were removed from our mom when I was 10, and Eva did everything she could to keep my brother and I out of the system. I think it was because she was worried we\u2019d be separated and I know she was in foster care for a little bit when she was younger too so I guess that was another reason she didn\u2019t want us to go in.\nShe has guardianship of us now and the adoption process is already going through.\n\nSo today we were having a family dinner at a relatives house, and some people from our moms side of the family (aunt, uncles, cousins, etc.) were there with us.\nMy aunt ended up making kind of a big deal out of the fact that Eva had me and James help with some of the prep for dinner. She ended up saying something like \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be bossing them around. They\u2019re not your kids and you\u2019re not their mother.\u201d\n\nBefore anyone could respond I said \u201cwell we haven\u2019t been your sisters kids for like seven years now so who do you think was doing her job instead?\u201d\nMy aunt got mad and then eventually everyone was arguing.\nSo dinner was ruined, a few of my cousins even texted me afterwards and said so, and pretty much everyone ended up going home.\n\nEva told me that it\u2019s not my responsibility to defend her, then she said she was sorry for the situation with our aunt. I feel bad because I made Eva feel bad, and because according to most of our family, I ruined the occasion with what I said. They think that it wasn\u2019t the place or time for me to bring up my mother\u2019s situation, even if it was just in response to what my aunt was saying.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean to ruin dinner or anything. But if I was out of line then I\u2019ll apologize. I\u2019m just posting because I want to get some unbiased perspectives from other people.\n\nETA:\n\nI saw a few people ask why no one in my mom's family helped my sister out when she was 19 and suddenly responsible for two kids, and honestly I don't know.

Your aunt was out of line to comment on what your sister asked you to do and then she couldn't handle the truth when you spoke up. Too bad for her. Your sister is right that it wasn't your \"responsibility\" to defend her, but it was the right (and honorable) thing to do IMO. Congrats on your impending adoption! Your sister sounds like a gem.", "You're NTA. Your aunt should have stayed in her lane. She's also wrong. Why shouldn't a 17 and 9 year old contribute to the family meal? How else are you supposed to learn how to do these things? \n\nAnd really, as a kid I liked helping. It's better to know you're being useful that to be treated as if the adults would prefer you stay out of the way.", "NTA not only did your Aunt instigate the whole issue by taunting your sister but you were defending an innocent party. You were really kind to defend your sister and I'm sure she know that too. If your family can't have a dinner without being rude to eachother then rushing out in anger then they don't deserve to eat together at all.\n\nI'm sorry to hear that you had trouble with your mother and for any issues caused from that, hopefully things improve for you and your siblings, maybe try to set some healthy boundaries with the rest of the family for your own health and comfort, but no, you're not the asshole at all.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt brought up the situation, you just responded. Apologize to Eva for upsetting her, tell her your love her, and don't like when people are rude to her. But you should follow her lead in these situations. \n\nYour aunt is not owed an apology, but listen to Eva on this if it makes her life easier. \n\nEva has gone above and beyond and your other family did not take you and your brother in, so they should be quiet on this and any other conversation about who your mom is.", "NTA. They only caused such an uproar because they know they all failed you, your brother and your sister - both that they let things get so bad you had to be removed from your mother\u2019s care, and that they left it down to a 19 year old to step up because clearly nobody else would. They didn\u2019t like being faced with the ugly truth.", "NTA- Is your Aunt unaware of the situation? That was a deliberate insult.", "First of all, your sister is the MVP! And your Aunt was WAY out of line. NTA", "NTA. Your aunt ruined dinner, not you, and definitely not your sister. Exactly WHAT was your aunt thinking the outcome would be?", "NTA. Your aunt shouldn't be interfering with how your household is run. It sounds like you weren't having any issues with your sister telling you what needed to be done, so no one else should have had a problem with it either. And, not to sound petty, but your aunt started it with the \"they're not your kids....\" comment. Maybe not, but she is your Guardian. And good for you for standing up for her.\n\nThis all could have been avoided by your aunt apologizing for her comment, which she didn't do, so you cannot take blame for ruining dinner. Everyone could have simply dropped it there, so everyone who took part in the argument takes some of the blame for ruining dinner. \n\nAll you did was defend someone you care for - you acted in good faith, whereas your aunt tried to bully your sister.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt was out of line. If she didn\u2019t want you to mention your mother, she shouldn\u2019t have used the word to put down your actual guardian.\n\nAlso, what a weird thing for her to have a problem with in the first place. Oh no, a 17yo and a 9yo are actually helping prepare dinner! How scandalous!\n\nRespond to anyone who tells you you were out of line that you were simply correcting your aunt. No further info or justifications. One standard line. Play. Rewind.

Let me guess, the aunt didn't do much to help Eva out despite her being only 19 when you were removed from your mother?", "NTA\n\nYour sister sounds amazing. Your aunt sounds terrible. If it was me, I'd tell your sister how much you appreciate her and let her decide if she wants you to apologize. I'd do it for her, but not because the aunt or cousins deserve anything other than what they got.\n\nYour conscience should be clear.", "No - you didn't ruin dinner. Your aunt was trying to start crap and you stopped it.\n\n>Eva told me that it\u2019s not my responsibility to defend her, then she said she was sorry for the situation with our aunt. I feel bad because I made Eva feel bad,\n\nEva says that because she is lining out for you, but I'm sure she is also really touched that you are standing up for her.", "Eva is right it's not your job to defend her but it doesn't sound like she's upset with you. Your sister and brother are alk that matters right now sounds like the rest of your family is lacking in brains and empathy. \n\n  \nNTA but maybe let Eva defend herself next time.", "NTA. I think you were quite polite. \n\nI would have added \u201cand please explain where you were, auntie dearest, when sister became our guardian?", "NTA\n\nYour aunt was sticking her nose in where it didn't belong. I bet she knows darned well you aren't in your mother's custody.", "So very much NTA- but your aunt is. \n\nYou pointed out an uncomfortable truth for your family in a shared space.  They might not have to deal with it very often but you have to deal with  the fact that your mom is not present for you every day. They probably don't enjoy being reminded of it.", "NTA. As someone who was adopted, being asked about my \"real\" parents always irritated the fuck out of me. I'd reply that my real parents were the ones that raised me. I know you feel bad for your sister feeling bad, but you shouldn't at all feel bad for correcting your aunt, who was obviously inserting herself where she had no business.", "NTA. I\u2019d stick up for my sister and she never had to do half of what your sister did for you and lil bro. Give your sister a hug and tell her she\u2019s awesome! She\u2019s doing a pretty great job by her siblings!", "NTA, I wanna adopt you \ud83d\ude02\n\nAuntie FAFO.", "NTA one bit!  You told the truth, and they couldn\u2019t handle the truth!\n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin Thanksgiving, they did.", "NTA. Very nice and good of you to defend your sister. I'd have done the same. Sad that dinner was canceled but that was on your dumb aunt.", "Your aunt ruined the dinner. Your sister is your parent. Your aunt is just another adult who should have stepped up and failed.", "NTA. Your aunt was being a total AH, on the other hand. She has some nerve saying \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t be bossing them around. They\u2019re not your kids and you\u2019re not their mother.\u201d Isn't she aware that your sister is adopting you & your brother? Or does she always spew this kind of nonsense.\n\n*She has guardianship of us now and the adoption process is already going through.* That would have been a more civil response. But what you said to her is absolutely & undeniably true. Your aunt had that smack down coming :)", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. The three of you have been through a great deal. I\u2019m so glad you were able to be together. It\u2019s clear that you love your sister and fully understand what an amazing and gigantic thing she has done in being your guardian. She stood in the breach for you two. It makes perfect sense that you\u2019d want to stand up for her. Your aunt was out of line and sounds hateful too. She knows exactly who has been taking care of you guys and why. That was a terrible thing for her to say and just shows her to be unkind and unintelligent.", "You're a teenager who defended a loved one who asked you to do chores. I'd buy you a pony if I could. NTA from the (custodial) parent of a teenager. Although I do advise that you be willing to call a truce for Christmas now that your sister has said she prefers you let her handle your aunt.", "Nta, you didn\u2019t ruin anything. Who did was a bitter aunt who probably thinks her sister was wronged by having her kids taken away.", "Your aunt ruined things.  No one else", "DO NOT APOLOGIZE.", "NTA. The aunt is TA for undermining your sister and the family didn\u2019t help by getting on your case for speaking up. They should have recognized that your sister is raising you and your sibling. And honestly you should be able to open and honest without worrying how it makes other relatives feel.", "Do *not* apologize! *You* did nothing wrong. If anyone wants to place blame then it's solely on the aunt and your mother.\n\nNTA sweetie, and I hope you and your little family have a wonderful holiday season! *The rest of your relations can go drink turkey fat!*", "NTA - but, probably would have been better to not say anything. Though you were totally right and its great that you were sticking up for Eva, sometimes the path of least resistance is best. \n\nI\u2019d talk to your sister about this and just get her feedback.", "NTA", "NTA at all! \n\nYou\u2019re 17 and 9! And like you said, 7 years! \n\nIt sounds like you and your siblings get along so well. What amazing humans! \n\nThey likely won\u2019t stop, so stand proud in your truth. You got this!", "NTA You were not out of line, you spoke the truth to a bunch of horrible people.", "NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. Your additional comments here show that your sister has raised you to be a beautiful young man with a strong inner character and a smart head on your shoulders. Trust your instincts and don't let your mother's fucked up family throw you off your path. They are the AHs, every single one of them, for abandonig their nephews and niece. And your little family of siblings is absolutely heartwarming.", "Who\u2019s paying the hospital bills for the burn unit you sent your aunt too?

No one had her back when she was a kid. NTA", "Woah!  Your Aunt started this fire.  You were honest. \n\nThe aunt sounds like she wanted to put Eva down and that just won\u2019t fly.  She\u2019s not there so she should stay in her lane.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA your sister sounds like a saint and I love that you stood up for her.   \n\n\n1. For all intents and purposes, you and your brother are her kids. She's your guardian and will be your adopted parent.\n2. Even if she was literally a babysitter, there would be nothing wrong with getting you & your brother to help with dinner prep. You especially, you could legally join the army next year I'm confident you're more than capable of setting a table and mashing potatoes.\n3. Idk your family history but I am not seeing a lot of possibilities where your aunt has any business whatsoever taking shots at your sister's childrearing techniques. Where was she when her sister was neglecting you all? Where was she when 19 year old Eva stepped up and took on a 10 and 2 year old?\n\nI suspect the rest of your family just doesn't want to deal with your aunt's tantrums and it's easier to tell you to apologise.", "Why do you even associate with those people?\n\nApologize to Eva and James for adding fuel to the fire, but no one else is entitled to an apology from you.\n\nYou're not the one who ruined things- your aunt did with her bullshit remark. She's the AH who brought up your mother's situation. They're blaming you, because they don't want to look into the mirror and examine where they were when Eva needed help as a child, or when you and James needed a reliable adult. \n\nNTA\nYou and Eva are good people and growing up with you two, I've no doubt James will be too.", "**NTA** \\- But apologize anyway if it makes life easier for Eva.", "ESH.

Your aunt is a woman who let her niece go into foster care. \n\nWhen the next two children were removed from their mother she let her 19 year old niece be the one to step up and take care of a 10 year old and a 2 year old. The audacity for her to then criticise your sister for parenting you is off the charts.", "NTA", "NTA - your family are jerks, your sister is amazing and you did the right thing.", "Nta\n\nYour sister is amazing and the rest of the family ain't shit. Remember that when you're successful because it sounds like they're the type to come after your money.", "NTA. Your sister is wonderful, and you were right to defend her. You can apologize to your sister, but just tell her how much you love her and how grateful you are to her for stepping in when no one else did. I'm sure she'll understand. The rest of your family deserves to feel guilty over what happened.", "NTA - I have an aunt who always says dumb/insensitive shit at family events.  I have taken on the role of counteracting her.  I love asking her just how much wine she has had because that was socially inappropriate (whatever comment, question, statement she made).  I watched throughout my whole childhood while she upset people with no-one calling her out or holding her accountable.  I made a decision it ended once I was an adult.  I enjoy making her unhappy, cant think of anyone more deserving.  Family events are much less dramatic now.", "NTA, in fact, your aunt is definitely the AH! Even if your sister Eva didn't want you to defend her, you did the right thing. Please remember this in life. The truth is ALWAYS the best.", "NTA, I  would have done the same thing, maybe said more. You guys stick together \u2764\ufe0f you have an amazing sister. Besides that I hope you have a good dinner and ate a lot \ud83d\ude03", "NTA if she can\u2019t take the heat she should stay out of the kitchen! You only said the truth, if they can\u2019t handle that I don\u2019t know what to say. If your sister was hosting that makes it even more unforgivably rude for your aunt to make those comments. Congrats on the adoption!!\n\nETA: oh now I see it was someone else\u2019s house. Regardless, that lady was out of line, for no reason.", "NTA. Your aunt made it public by saying that in front of everyone, including you, so no one can argue that you should have taken her aside for a private discussion. Also, she sounds like a piece of work. In fact, your mom's whole family seem like hypocrites. Not one of them took in your sister to keep her out of foster care but they are content to let your aunt criticize the way she raises you and your siblings?! Fuuuuck that.", "NTA. Very clearly not. However, if you\u2019ve upset Eva you need to apologise. Apologise to her obviously m, but your words may well have upset a delicate balance between Eva and your aunt. So you should apologise to her too. You can make that apology as genuine as you want. If it were me I\u2019d say \u201cI\u2019m sorry for snapping at you like that, I shouldn\u2019t have responded that way. The way I spoke to you was not ok. The content of my remark remains true though. Eva is my sister and my parent and is raising us and has every right to teach us responsibility and manners. So while I am sorry for speaking the way I did in front of everyone I stand by the fact that Eva is my parent\u201d", "NTA. Some people hate reality checks on their criticisms of others. Your aunt got a reality check and hated it. I encourage you to continue giving reality checks.", "NTA. You have every right to defend the only person who has taken you in and provided for you.

I\u2019d drop those people and just have thanksgiving with the three of you next year. Y\u2019all don\u2019t need that negativity.", "NTA. You did absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA. Your sister is doing her best and actually acting like a parent. And then your aunt gives her crap for setting an example and setting expectations, like a guardian should. Aunt was acting like an absolute tool. \n\nIt\u2019s always the most offensive people that get offended when you push back on their bs.", "Wouldn't be Thanksgiving without drama.\nNTA. Aunt is out of line. Did she come to help you guys stay together? No, your sister did. Keep strong.", "They didn't take in family? I'd sleep on the floor to help out a child family member.", "NTA. Your aunt is a flaming one, though. She wildly out of line. Who, exactly, does she think should be responsible for parenting you guys if not the adult with full custody? If she feels so strongly, where was she when a 19 year old stepped up to be a parent to her siblings?", "Absolutely NTA!", "You're a good one OP, shout out to your sister/mom", "Applause for you!! You didn\u2019t ruin anything. You stood up for Eva the \u201cmom\u201d who loves you. You made it a wonderful day for her and she\u2019s all that matters!", "NTA. So, instead of apologizing for her insensitive remarks, your aunt preferred to pretend that she did not know the situation/circumstances with you and your siblings???  She got upset because you told the truth. She knows that your sister has been your parent for seven years. She should have apologized as soon as you made your remarks. Your sister should never invite her back.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt needs to stay in her lane,\n.", "NTA.  None of these people stepped up to help your sister or you and your brother. Their feelings and opinions about your lives should carry no weight with you. Nothing you said was untrue or unjust. They should all be ashamed of their own behavior instead of criticizing your sister and defending your mother. I\u2019m glad that the three of you have each other.", "NTA \n\nThe aunt was way out of line and NEEDED to be informed of the reality of the situation. Besides, she isn't your mother or guardian either, so she doesn't get to say jack squat. Anyone taking her side is not a person you want in your chosen family.", "Your sister is parenting you. It is your responsibility to defend her and you did, good on you.\n\nWho ever is parenting has the right to set the house rules. That's literally the job because the parent has to get the food on the table, make sure the kids go to school, etc. If they don't work out the house rules, who is going to?\n\nExcepting abuse or corporal punishment, no one has the right to tell the parent how to parent. It's an incredibly hard job and every family is different. You folks are happy and taken care of and that is a real miracle.\n\nDon't bother talking to this aunt. She is toxic. She will create issues for you in the future.", "NTA\n\nYou noted that when your sister had to go into foster care it was because none of your relatives would take her into their family.  \n\nThey also didn\u2019t help her when she fought to get custody of you and your younger brother. \n\nSo when your aunt (your mother\u2019s sister) decided to offer her unsolicited advice you merely stated the truth.  \n\nNot your fault they didn\u2019t like remembering they didn\u2019t do diddle squat to support your sister ever. \n\nHypocrites are very touchy about things like the truth being presented to them.  \n\nSo nope you weren\u2019t at all at fault.  \n\nMaybe next year have a smaller Thanksgiving celebration with just the 3 of you or include a few friends who might have no where to go.", "I\u2019m so glad you said that to your aunt! A whole extended family who couldn\u2019t be bothered to take in even one of 3 kids whose mother was taken out of the picture and all of them are still being given a place of respect in your lives!\n\nClearly, your aunt didn\u2019t lift a finger to help any of you out when you were about to go into the foster care system. So, she doesn\u2019t get to say a single word to you three siblings about the dynamics between you. \n\nI seriously hope she was properly offended by your statement and never visits you guys again! NTA so so much!", "NTA. You were simply stating the harsh truth. Too many people these days can\u2019t handle the harsh truth, and that\u2019s their problem that they should\u2019ve gotten over long ago. Good for you for standing up for your sister.", "NTA. Your aunt sounds like a piece of work. She has no right to comment on your situation, since she obviously couldn't be bothered to take care of you herself. Your sister sounds great. Maybe you could have put it a different way, but there's nothing wrong with defending your sister.", "NTA, your aunt had no business making that comment and deserved the truthful answer you gave her. Especially when she didn\u2019t help y\u2019all when you needed it. Do something extra nice for your sister to show her how much you appreciate her, she\u2019s a good person and it\u2019s hard to do what she\u2019s doing for y\u2019all.", "NTA, it\u2019s called a thanksgiving clapback. I\u2019m sorry but your entire family is trash (except you, your sister and brother) and have no right to make passive aggressive comments like that.", "NTA. Your aunt started it by commenting on Eva.", "Your sister is a saint! To take on such responsibility at such a young age.", "NTA... Eve stepped up. And you are greatful.  I'm glad, and not worried about the rest of the family", "People don\u2019t like the truth.", "You didn't make Eva feel bad. She clearly loves you boys and takes good care of you.

I'm sorry that your sister was a little embarrassed but I'm so glad that she has brothers who love, appreciate and defend her.  She sounds awesome!", "NTA. Your aunt was looking for a fight. Let\u2019s say, even if your mom was still around, there is nothing wrong with asking the younger family members to help with prep. It\u2019s what a good parent does. She was soooo out of line for saying what she said, and you were just telling the truth.\n\nI understand Eva not wanting to rock the boat, but your moms family sounds like a bunch of a-holes.", "NTA You ruined nothing, that so called aunt opened fire with her nasty uncalled for comments. Just make sure to ignore that one from now on, she isn\u2019t worth the air she inhales.", "You were not out of line. Nta, aunt had a really unnecessary and dumb comment, you responded with the truth. She raises you guys. She is soon even legally your mom.\n\nHats off to her and hats off to you!", "You didn't ruin anything! Good job sticking up for your sis! Aunt ruined it by even thinking it was ok to say. You can defend your sister whenever you want to. Your mom's family clearly doesn't care about you all. They come around to have something to feel better about themselves. Basically miserable people love to have company. If none of these people are helping you and your siblings, BLOCK THEM ALL!! \n\nOH MY VERDICT IS NTA!", "NTA. You weren\u2019t mean. Just honest. Not your fault they are incapable of dealing w the reality of it all", "NTA your extended family sound god awful. YOU didn't ruin dinner. Your aunt did by saying such an awful thing.", "NTA.\n\nI am sure everyone explained to you that your Aunt was in the wrong.  Good on you for defending your big sis.  Real reason for my reply is simply because I wanted to say your sister is a Saint.  Please do right by her in the future. I'm sure you realize how lucky you and your brother are to have such a wonderful person in your life. God bless that Girl. I am in awe of her maturity and family dedication.  Reading your story hit different, maybe cause its Thanksgiving here in the States and I'm feeling a little sentimental, myself. \n\n Best of luck in the future OP.

They should be grateful and appreciative of how much your sister has helped you and your sibling.\n\n\nI might be a little bias, as I have that creepy uncle who when I told him not to touch me kept grabbing me by the shoulder at a Thanksgiving and I punched him. Split the family down the middle and \"ruined\" Thanksgiving. \n\nIdk why families can be like this. Had an uncle threaten suicide and I called the cops. \"You're overdramatic.\" Nah, I don't want his suicide on my hands. \n\nFamilies don't like accepting the truth. Good on you for sticking up for your sister. But the adults (minus your sister) are the ones putting this on you because  of their own failure to do better.", "Now that's a Thanksgiving clap back. NTA", "NTA. You only told the truth to your aunt and it seems she can\u2019t accept that. Your sister sounds awesome, I feel bad reading about how your aunt talked to her.

I'd also suggest that you and your brother learn how to cook--not on a professional chef level, but on the level where if you're the only one home and you're hungry, you don't have to live on sandwiches and/or takeout. If it seems a bit difficult at times, just think of a day in the future when a beautiful lady will tell your children \"I knew I was going to marry your daddy when he invited me to dinner one day...and he cooked it just for me.\" (She will think you're wonderful because you put the effort into it, even if you make something relatively simple like steak and fries.)", "NTA, they seem to have guilty consciences, and that's not your problem.", "You did the right thing standing up for your awesome sister.", "NTA.

Sure she\u2019s your sister too but she had to take on the responsibility of a mother when she was 19. 19. And I saw the edit about none of them trying to keep her out of the system.

I hope you and your siblings at least enjoyed your meal together, your sister sounds great!", "NTA. You showed restraint by keeping your response limited to a witty quip. \n\nNobody from your extended family is actively helping you or your siblings, are they?  They didn\u2019t help your sister when she needed help.  They didn\u2019t try to defend your sister when an older adult acted inappropriately.  Nobody took your side. \n\nThis sends a very clear message: you owe them nothing and they\u2019ll never step up to help you.  \n\nThis is not necessarily bad.  You have a clear line drawn in the sand.  You and your 2 siblings are your family.  The others are just distant relatives. Their actions are what make them \u201cdistant\u201d. \n\nYour aunt\u2019s comments came from a place of jealously and guilt for not being mature or strong enough to accomplish what your sister has accomplished in taking care of you. It\u2019ll only get worse as your family continues to thrive.  \n\nSeriously consider separating yourselves from those distant relatives.  Blood alone does not make you a family.  What you do and how you act is what makes you a family.  The others are going to just keep wearing you three down to make themselves feel better.  \n\nIf your aunt is comfortable talking like that out loud in front of you, I guarantee she\u2019s saying worse behind your backs.  There\u2019s a clear lack of respect coming from those distant relatives and age has absolutely nothing to do with your right to be properly respected.  \n\nYou\u2019re perfect the way you are.  Youre a good brother.  You\u2019re part of a good family.  You are your own best ally.  Your sister is awesome and you little brother is fantastic too.  You three are enough.  Your family might grow with new members (blood or not), but know that you three are enough and you don\u2019t need anyone else.  Especially if those \u201cother people\u201d don\u2019t show you and your family respect.", "I am sorry that you feel you did something wrong.\n\nBecause it was your aunt that was rude and out of order.\n\nPossibly they have a little bit of awareness of how they have let you all down and the guilt is being directed on resentment at Eva, the person that acted like a caring responsible adult. Her goodness shows them up and they can't cope with it.\n\nNTA", "Definitely NTA op, you were protecting the person who has been protecting you and your little sister.\n\nWell done for putting your opinionated aunt in her place, your older sister is probably secretly proud of you for defending her.", "You and your siblings sound like great people. You are NTA and while your sister said you did not have to defend her, she knows you have her back.", "Uh, how could you be the AH? Your sister has guardianship? That means the courts say she is your guardian. That means she literally IS supposed to be bossing you around!!!! Your Aunt was completely out of line. Your sister should not be so sensitive to you defending her...  geez she should get an award for how she stepped up for you and your little brother. Isn't one in 10 thousand young adults like her who would have stepped up like that. Was it the right time to bring it up? Nope...  but that is on your Aunt as you didn't bring it up your Aunt did. This is not something you should apologize for.", "NTA. \nYour sister did a very hard and wonderful thing for you two. You\u2019re old enough to understand that and I think sticking up for immediately shows that.imagine in two years, you had to take care of a 10 year old and a 2 year old. Just wow. \nYour Aunt has no right to criticize her especially when they had the opportunity to help her or you and your brother for that matter but didn\u2019t. \nIf they feel the need to defend their sister/ your bio mom, and attack your sister to do it, that is pathetic. I\u2019d sure as shit call them out on it too. \nI personally would take the simple option of dropping all contact and not dealing with them ever again.", "NTA, and telling someone that they shouldn\u2019t listen to their sole parental figure just because they aren\u2019t your BIO mom is inappropriate. She\u2019s adopting you so legally she will be your mother. Either way, it\u2019s none of your aunts business.\n\nThat being said\u2026 try to let Eva handle it first next time. Trust me I get your instinct to protect Eva - I\u2019m highly protective over my own mother for a variety of reasons I won\u2019t get into - but sometimes the drama it causes puts more stress onto the person you\u2019re trying to protect. Doesn\u2019t feel right, but if that\u2019s what Eva\u2019s choice is than you should respect it if it\u2019s just an occasional snide remark.\n\nIt sounds like your aunt and uncles might be protective over your bio mom like you are of Eva and while you should have the right to say how you feel about her, it seems like a sensitive topic. Instead of going right for the throat, responding with something like \u201cI like helping Eva\u201d May be a bit more diplomatic. Aunt won\u2019t be able to complain once the adoption goes through anyway.\n\nTo be clear, I still don\u2019t think you should apologize to anyone but potentially Eva. But, family dynamics are complicated and sometimes you have to weigh if fighting over a comment is worth the stress it could cause.", "Thanks! And yeah, she really is a gem. I can't imagine what my life would've been like if she wasn't there to fill in where our mother fell short. She's the best sister I could've ever asked for tbh, and I'm glad she'll \"officially\" be my parent soon.", "NTA. Sister is amazing and the aunt should keep her big mouth shut.", "THIS!!\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46", "I think it's because she doesn't make her sons help with stuff like that, so she thinks it's weird that my sister has us cooking and setting the table?\n\nI really like helping too though. I don't like the idea of sitting around doing nothing while my sister and other female relatives are working their ass off in the kitchen.", "I agree.  My 12 year old son made the cranberry sauce under my supervision, set the table, and helped his dad make the pies.  My 16 year old son made the green beans.  Both helped clean up.  How do they learn how to do this if they don't help?", "Right? All 3 of my kids helped today. They peeled potatoes, prepped frozen rolls for the oven, set the table, and fetched things for me. It\u2019s not gonna kill them to help out for a few minutes.", "It almost sounds like she wanted to cause a reaction with 'You're not their mother'. What else was there to say???\n\nOh yeah, my mother.....ummm where has she been the last 7 years???\n\nOP your big sister sounds amazing and you didn't ruin dinner, your Aunt did.

I don't understand the thought process behind insulting your niece for doing what your sister couldn't.", "I sort of mentioned this in my comment, but I am thinking the aunt is jealous of how well the sister is raising the brothers.  She\u2019s also projecting guilt for not stepping up to help.  Her comments went straight for the jugular.  They were meant to hurt and diminish the sister for clearly being a better person.  It\u2019s actually pretty aggressive behavior if you really think about how targeted that comment was.", "And my parents are together so it\u2019s not like they not married family members will always be jealous. They probably jealous of your sister because they can\u2019t take credit for taking you kids in.", "You didn't ruin anything! I'm amazed that people who would have let Eva and the two of you rot in the system were even invited to a family Thanksgiving. They sure don't act like family or even friends. God bless you and your siblings; I wish you three many more happy Thanksgivings together. NTA, but your aunt and the rest of them certainly are!", "You're an awesome brother. Good on you.", "Sounds like your family is lashing out from guilt. Not a one of them could bother to take in 1 child when your mother had been removed as guardian, and yet when history repeated itself, she took not 1 child on but 2! \n\nI imagine it galls them. She did what they would not or could not, and with 2 instead of 1. All the tiny excuses they made for themselves about why they couldn't take her in have been shown to be lies, simply because she did it, she made it work. And some of them might genuinely feel remorse they turned her down and she made it look easy. \n\nSome will feel it's a criticism of them. Some will simply feel uncomfortable in ways they cannot express. If you do your best, and someone else comes along and does it better, it can sting something fierce. To not even try for fear of failure and then have a younger person excel at it... \n\nThere are probably a myriad of negative emotions swirling around your family because of your sister. But those are their emotions, their problems, and they're being sorry by taking it out on her. \n\nYou and sis are NTA hun, cherish each other.", "NTA - At this point you are old enough to recognize that most of your extended family are terrible people.

Way to be a good person. NTA", "I had a feeling that\u2019s why aunt had a problem with it, as soon as I saw you were both male.\n\nThankfully Eva has done a better job teaching you and your brother than aunt is doing with her sons.\n\nYou are definitely NTA.   You simply pointed out the truth and defended your sister.", "Ah, so auntie is a misogynist as well as an asshole. Her boys are growing up handicapped. \n\nI'm a late in the generation boomer (b. 1960). My much older siblings and I weren't raised with those gender roles. We all learned cooking, laundry, lawn care, home repair, etc. If I had dated a guy and found out he couldn't cook or clean, I'd have been showing him the door. \n\nMy parents may have been ahead of the curve, but they were right. Just like your sister is right. And good for you for recognizing that helping is often its own reward.", "It's gross that she doesn't expect her sons to help.  I hate families where the men sit on their butts while the womenfolk bust their butts in the kitchen.", "See, she probably lashed out at you because she realised how lazy her kids look in comparison to you.\n\nI.E. Your aunt looks like a bad mom, in comparison to your sister who raised you well, despite being so young and struggling.\n\nThe other people in the family possibly feel guilty and called out, because none of them stepped in to help raise you. and you pointing out your sister raise you on her own might have made them feel guilty.", "Ohhhh\u2026 so it is an internalized misogyny thing.", "She teaching you life lessons and skills on how to take care of yourself.

Knowing how to cook and being familiar with the kitchen is a good life skill. And it's not unusual for a man. Being a professional chef is very much a male dominated field.", "Your cousins are definitely going to have a much harder time dating than you are.  Women are not putting up with guys like that anymore.", ">How do they learn how to do this if they don't help?\n\nI think the point is they don\u2019t: that\u2019s women\u2019s work according to this aunt.", "In misogynistic households, they aren\u2019t expected to ever learn how to do this.

What you said was based in pure truth.  Your aunt really had no place making a snarky remark to your sister, either.

Good for you for standing up for you, your brother, and your sister. \n\nYou literally just pointed out the truth. And sadly for the aunt, the truth hurts. \n\nYour mum neglected all of you and was deemed an unfit mother and had all 3 of you taken away from her care. That doesn't happen lightly. They try and keep kids with their parents if they can work with them and support them to improve. Clearly your mum was unfit to be a mother. \n\nWhat your sister did taking you both in at just 19 years old is very admirable and she should be proud of herself. Especially given the fact that none of the other relatives stepped up to take her in when she was put in care, or when you were taken from your mum. They cant knock her for stepping up and parenting you when they werent willing to do it themselves. \n\nAlso, Getting you to help prepare dinner is not bossing you around or making you into slaves or anything like that. It's good to teach kids how to cook and prepare meals, as well as its good for kids to do age appropriate chores to help out in the house. Preparing a meal together can actually be a fun and bonding experience. \nShe's also teaching you both how to become more independant as you get older with is the responsibilities of a parent. \n\nYour aunt is likely jealous of the fact your sister has stepped up and managed to care for you so well, considering how badly her sister failed at the task of being a parent. She doesn't like the fact you guys are close and that she's doing well parenting you. \n\nYou didn't ruin the meal by stating a fact. You also weren't the one to bring up your mother's failings. SHE DID. SHE was the one who criticised your sister saying she's not your parent and she's not your mum. She was the one who brought that conversation up. So she can't blame you for stating the fact that her sister isn't your mum either as she's not been raising you all for years. Your sister literally is your parental guardian legally. \n\nDo not feel guilty one bit. \n\nI'm sure deep down your sister is extremely touched by what you said, and the fact you stood up for her and all that she's done for you. I u derstand she doesn't want you to feel you have to defend her, but you're also old enough now to speak for yourself and you only answered your aunt back truthfully for what she said . \n\nTo any of the family messaging you blaming you for ruining the dinner, I'd be telling them to think twice about who bought up the conversation in the 1st place. It was your aunt who ruined the dinner because she was the one who decided to not only put your sister down, for no reason, when all she's done is a great job raising you, and has done a better job that your mother did when she didn't have to do that, she did it out of love for you. But your aunt was the one who bought the subject up by claiming she's not your parent and she's not your mother. There was no need for her to say anything. And you were just stating a fact that your mother isn't your parent anymore legally, and she's not been a mother to any of you as she had you all taken from her care. If your aunt didn't want that topic bought up, she shouldn't have said what she did to your sister. If the meal was ruined it was your aunts fault. And if she doesn't like hearing the truth, then she shouldn't bad mouth your sister in that way, then you'll have no reason to point out what your birth mother is like. I'd also point out to those people that your sister stepped up to raise you when none of the other adult relatives did, and she's managed to do a great job, so they've got no right to talk badly about her at all and they should take a look at themselves in the mirror. \n\nIf they continue to behave that way, I'd be cutting contact with them. \nGood for you for standing up for yourself, and your sister. I've no doubt she really appreciated your comment deep down, and it would have meant the world to her knowing how much you appreciate and understand what she's done for you and your brother at such a young age herself.", "NTA what a \"mom thing\" to say from your sister, if this is what you feel tell her :actually as siblings you have to stand up for each other!

Family can make this even harder because family can say some fucked up shit to each other.   \nI have certain family members who are a little hard to deal with so in order to keep the peace they have to be treated like children. In someways it is messed up that nobody can be completely honest with them but nobody wants to argue with them every time we see them. It is also true that we all can't be perfect, we can have strengths in some areas and weakness in others. My step dad taught me a few things in life, and helped me get a job when I was young, and was fun sometimes- but talking politics with him was awful. \n  \nAnyway you probably get my point, if you really need to be heard, use some tact, use some humor, or not but deciding when to be blunt and when to soften the blow puts you in a situation of power and it's better to be in control.", "NTA at all.

The aunt should mind her own business.", "NTA. Let me start by saying how sorry I am that you all went through all this.  With the little we know, I\u2019d say many of the family members deserve the reprimand.  As for The apology, I\u2019d ask your sister Eva. Since she saved you and your sibling from the system, if she, who was present at the dinner, thinks you should apologize, perhaps you should. You owe her that much. So I\u2019d rely on Eva rather than the uninformed social media. \n\nThere are lessons here. Next time bite your tongue just a little bit longer and see where the conversations go. Or say something else like you and your sibling don\u2019t mind working. And if things escalate anyway then sometimes a reality check is in order. \n\nAnother lesson is that some family members aren\u2019t worth it. I had a bad situation with my dad\u2019s side of the family at his wake after he died. Words were exchanged and afterwards, my mom, sister and myself never spoke to them again. None of them. Uncles, aunt, grandma were all vanished from our lives and, unfortunately, many cousins were collateral damage - in blocking their parents, my cousins ended up being little seen. All this in 1984. Now all the perpetrators are dead. \n\nIf your outside family is toxic, I\u2019d consider not dealing with them. A lot of this is Eva\u2019s call but she may consider next year\u2019s thanksgiving to be just the three of you along with perhaps a few others. Peace of mind is worth more than family loyalty to those who don\u2019t deserve it.", "NTA.\n\nOnly question is why you spend time with these people in the first place.

Clearly your aunt sucks to treat anyone like that in front of their kids (there's probably a more nuanced phrase than saying your Eva's kids but you get what I mean).\n\nAs for you, you're only 17 and trying to do the right thing so I wanna cut you slack. But learning how to handle tense and sensitive social situations is something you'll need to learn as you get older.

Try practicing some phrases of praise for Eva that even the most negative person can\u2019t refute. \n\nIf these people continue badmouthing you and Eva, rather than saying, Auntie was being nasty to my sister, leave the negative part of the comment out, just say, I have a wonderful sister, she\u2019s so wonderful and I will never give up an opportunity to tell everyone how wonderful she is, and drop it. If Auntie continues, people may figure out that she\u2019s the troublemaker. If not, oh well. In that case, don\u2019t invite them back next year. I wouldn\u2019t invite them back. A lot of getting rid of suppressed anger and resentment is not letting those people around you any more.", "She is a double-gem for inviting the very people who failed her and her siblings.", "Dude, I bossed my ENTIRE family around the kitchen on Thanksgiving - parents included.", "Not only that but she let the sister go into foster care rather than work to keep her out of the system and find her a place in in the extended family.", "It's your aunt's feelings of guilt and inadequacy. Seeing your sister raise you well and have you help in the kitchen made some uncomfortable feelings swell up for your aunt. But instead of being a mature adult and dealing with those feelings, she decided to put down your sister and make it sound inappropriate that you were helping. This was her way of coping with her uncomfortable feelings. She can't possibly be wrong, it must be your sister. When you stood up for your sister and pointed out the very obvious, very objective truth, it blew all of those uncomfortable feelings right in her face. Again, rather than behaving like an adult and coping with the situation, she got defensive and turned it on you to make you the bad guy so she could feel better about herself and not deal with her uncomfortable feelings.\nYour aunt is very, very immature. You're 17 years old and have things better figured out that this grown ass woman. Good on you for helping, good on for sticking up for your sister, and good on you for not being one of those people who can't cope with reality when it makes them uncomfortable.", "I'll just jump on this one for OP, not saying any of them are good people but as someone who works in the system....it's possible nome of your family would have been approved to take your sister due to their own history or criminal backgrounds. It doesn't change A LOT, but if you end up wanting those answers someday, it might not have been that they didn't want your sister/you, they just weren't safe or appropriate to do so. The result is the same, but I know sometimes it changes things emotionally to know they didn't try versus weren't approved. They all sound inappropriate for sure, though.", "No kidding. Especially considering nobody stepped up to help any of them growing up and let Eva get put into the system. They're all self serving and want to pretend that the family is still close. Despite never actually DOING anything", "You\u2019ve been through a lot.  You were not wrong to react as you did.  The aunt mouthing off flexing opinions was over the edge and deserved to be reeled back a bit.  The mass reaction exposes a lot of guilt and blaming on everybody\u2019s part.  This whole situation is too raw for family parties this year, maybe next year will be better\u2026", "Definitely NTA. No matter what the reason was that they didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t open their homes to their sister\u2019s  kids, supporting the sister who is now parenting her siblings would have been the next best thing. Throwing that criticism at the oldest for not being their mother is cruel and total BS. She IS acting like a mother in every way, not them. Yes, she can defend herself but good on OP for having his big sis\u2019s back. The three siblings sound like a tight, good and caring family. All my best wishes to you, OP, and your great family!", "In my family the women are traditionally terrible cooks. So us boys run the kitchens in our houses. I hope to fix this issue with my daughters. Being able to cook is an amazing life skill. Especially if you learn how to improvise.", "My families used to be like this and I love sitting with the men and doing nothing, and if anyone of them ask me why I\u2019m not helping, I fire back with \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you?\u201d", "Seriously!  \u201cWell, the job was unexpectedly available, but none of you were free, so I\u2019m feeling pretty thankful that sister was there for us when no one else was.\u201d And then just smile and stare at her until she explodes.", "Finally!! There must be a long criteria to be met before foster/adoption/guardianship can be done. Thank you for the answers.", "That may be the case, but what prevented them from still offering to help Eva out with such things as occasional babysitting, dinner invites, chipping in with $$ for food and other necessities while in Eva's custody?   Did they even offer to help her out over the past 7 years?", "To me, the fact that other family may have been deemed unfit only underlines the fact that the aunt should have kept her mouth shut.", "We wanted to take in our grandchildren, but there's a clutter issue, a couple of outlets that don't work, & a Shepard mix dog. All keep us from taking them in \ud83d\ude2d\n\nI physically can't do it by myself", "Yup, I lucked out in meeting a man who had been raised by a mom who was president of the local NOW chapter. The first Thanksgiving I spent with their family, I was shocked when the men all jumped up to clear the table and clean up after dinner. We\u2019ve been married 20 years now, and it\u2019s amazing to have a true partner who was raised without gender roles.", "We're terrible cooks in my family, be it my father, mother or me and my siblings. Only detail: my siblings and I are all women. \n\nWe can technically cook, and it's (most of the time) edible. but yeah, our husbands are now the ones responsible for the kitchen.", "Clutter can be cleaned. Electricity fixed. Dog rehomed so children don\u2019t have to be.\n\nLife is full of options.", "And it should\u2014 as a culture, and a society we\u2019ve parted ways with shame to the detriment of future generations.\n\nThat whole goddamned family should feel ashamed of themselves.", "Right? No matter how I look at this, the rest of the family didn't step in or they -couldn't- step in because they were so unsuitable to place two children that the state would rather place them with their barely adult sibling. Fuck those people. I hope OP and their siblings live long and HAPPY  lives.", "Aw internet,  you're choosing to be adorable today.", ">niblings\n\nI'd like to thank you for introducing me to this word!", "Not everyone can afford to fix the electricity just like that, as if it\u2019s so easy and simple, and rehoming a dog is a lot bigger deal than you\u2019re making it out to be. **Rehoming is also traumatic for dogs, and can be for their owners as well. That\u2019s if you even can rehome and your only option isn\u2019t leaving them at a shelter which if the dog is over a certain age is an almost certain death sentence in many areas if you don\u2019t have time or options. \n\n**In regards to *everything*, money, housing, comfort, pets; do children need to come first sometimes? Absolutely. But life is full of options for *people who have options*. Most people who are in situations that have gotten them involved with the system never had a lot of options to begin with.", "I have beloved dogs. And grandchildren. And am short of funds. I\u2019d sell my world and break my pet mama heart to take in my grandchildren.", "Depending on the \"Outlet\" problem it may be a relatively  easy fix.  I replaced all the outlets in my kitchen, from off white to white.  If you have to choose between a dog and grandchildren, who could be raped in foster care, you choose the children.  How is that even a question!", ">Do children need to come first sometimes? Absolutely, but rehoming is also traumatic for dogs, and can be for their owners as well. That\u2019s if you even can rehome and your only option isn\u2019t leaving them at a shelter which if the dog is over a certain age is an almost certain death sentence in many areas if you don\u2019t have time or options.\n\nDo you grandchildren needing a home need to come first compared to a dog. Yes. Always. Not sometimes. \n\nIf you can't rehome and the dog gets put down, that is devastating yes. It is also not a reason to put the dog before your grandchildren needing a home.\n\nYour grandchildren needing a home comes before the dog every. single. time. Including at the expense of the dogs life. Including if that causes trauma.\n\nDogs are amazing. But they are not people. Your grandchildren are.", "What about the people who have nothing to sell? If you don\u2019t own your house/you\u2019re paying off your mortgage and have nothing of value what exactly do you expect someone to do? The vast majority (of the US at least, but also many other countries) lives paycheck to paycheck. Many people are thousands in debt. Some states require you to have zero mental or physical illness/disabilities and good paying jobs. You have to have home assessments and go to training. What happens if you can\u2019t afford to take time off work to go to training or wait at home for someone to show up to assess your home? You need to have a room for everyone in the house or separated by gender what if you don\u2019t have a big enough house for that? Foster parents are usually on the hook for day care expenses and the state won\u2019t help with that if the child needs it, what if they can\u2019t afford that? What if you don\u2019t have a world to sell or anything you could break that matters to the state to change their mind about placement?", "That\u2019s the whole point though. Depending on the problem. It could also be an expensive and difficult fix. And I never said the dog should come first, I literally said children need to come first sometimes, foster being one of them, but that doesn\u2019t make it any easier like they\u2019re implying it is. The dog took up a bigger part of the comment cause I couldn\u2019t say it as concisely but was the less important part than the money/house. Not everyone has options.", "Children coming first sometimes wasn\u2019t implying that dogs ever come before a child\u2019s life or living situation. It was poor wording to express a point about rehoming. I couldn\u2019t explain the dog part in as few words but the more important part of my comment was the money/house. Not the dog. I meant the children need to come first sometimes in general reference to the entire comment. As in first before money, housing, dogs, etc. It was placed badly in the paragraph but my point stands. Not everyone has options to take or choices/sacrifices to make to make it possible."]}
