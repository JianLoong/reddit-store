{"id": 2656, "submission_id": "yymfyc", "title": "AITA for not going on our traditional camping trip because of 1 guy?", "selftext": "So my friends and I have a traditional camping trip since our college days. It\u2019s nothing crazy and not at all a survival type situation but we do have to hike about 5 miles over uneven terrain and at a slight incline to get to the camping spot. It\u2019s not a rough hike at all because 2 people who usually go have asthma and they can do it while carrying their gear. Plus it\u2019s a mix group and there are women who are barely over 5\u2019 who can make this hike carrying their own gear.\n\nLast year a friend invited this guy she was dating along. This is a common practice so no one had any problems with it until we started the hike. The guy was complaining 5 minutes into the hike and kept it up the entire time. We also bring coolers of ice, food, and drinks. Usually the guys carry the coolers, 1 on each side. This dude was so winded walking, he gave up carrying his side of the cooler within sight of our cars. At this point I was already annoyed at his loud complaining and more so because I\u2019m stuck carrying a cooler by myself. Half way there, he couldn\u2019t make it with his pack so he took it off and another guy had to carry this dude\u2019s gear. We got to the camp site late and it was an hour after dark. I was tired, hungry, and in no mood for the dude. He was drenched in sweat, sat down, and did nothing while the rest of us set up the site and started to cook. I was annoyed for the rest of the time there but kept it to myself.\n\nOur camping trip is coming up and the dude and my friend are in a serious relationship. He\u2019s even more out of shape now than last year so I can already see repeat. When it came time to plan the trip, I opted out and said I can\u2019t make it. This is the 1st year I\u2019ve missed so there were questions. I didn\u2019t say anything to anyone but did tell my best friend because she was trying to work out all sorts of ways for me to go. She even offered to pay for my ticket because she thought it was a money issue. When I told her, she got offended and lectured me about how I need to be more accepting. I\u2019m accepting, I just don\u2019t want to hear him complain and carry his stuff because he can\u2019t. She said if I don\u2019t come she\u2019s going to be mad at me because my reason for not coming is stupid.\n\nNormally I wouldn\u2019t care but she\u2019s my best friend since college and I haven\u2019t seen her this mad at me before.", "created_utc": 1668784422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yymfyc/aita_for_not_going_on_our_traditional_camping/", "score": 363, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not like you gave an ultimatum, either he goes or you do, you just opted to sit this one out. It's unfortunate that you are missing out on a tradition you enjoy with your friends, and it's kinda shitty that she's trying to blame you for her guilt.", "NTA.  You don't want to spend your vacation listening to this guy complain, doing his share of the work, and carrying his stuff.  I don't blame you for any of that.  It's a shame you miss out on the vacation though.  Is there a way for you to join the group the next day so you avoid the hike in with the AH?", "NTA there's no point in going on a trip that you won't enjoy", "NTA. At all. I used to be a part of an off road club and it was member invite only. We had big camps every year and it was amazing. Club became hugely popular so they just opened up to everyone. And unfortunately, it attracted a lot of the kinds of people I don't want to associate with, and then the politics of 2016 crept in and I was out. Last camp I went to was 2017 and the vibe had changed too much and although I had fun, it didn't feel nearly as safe or calm or relaxing or fun as it once had. \n\nI don't understand why he would want to go of he had such a horrible time.", "The comment about women being able to make the hike is really fucking sexist.\n\nI mountaineer and climb. The women in these communities would crush 99.9% of men in some stupid hike. Your size and gender has shit all to do with ones ability to hike.", "NTA. It's easy for your 'best friend' to be accepting when she didn't pay the price of have to carry his gear or carry a cooler by herself. You should be sure to inform the group that she has eagerly volunteered to pick up the slack for him in the future.", "NTA\n\nWhat does your friend want?  For you to gladly accept carrying someone else's gear on tip of your own while they complain the whole time?\n\nIf it's not enjoyable for you, don't go. It's not like you said \"if he goes, I won't go.\" You just took yourself out of the equation and only said so once your friend pushed for more info.", "This. Aside from anything else, it's not up to your friend whether or not you go. I'm assuming why she thinks you're not being accepting enough, but if you're annoyed and would irritated for a weekend you don't anyone your presence.", "He's coming this year because he was babied the entire time last year and will expect the same treatment this year.\n\nOP is smart, they know this, that's why they're refusing to go.", "I would say that not being able to carry your own stuff the 2nd time would make this guy the AH. The first time, ok, it's annoying but he could have thought he could do it. Now he knows.", "NTA\n\nHowever, you need to be honest with everyone.  Start a group chat and say that you would like to go if:\n\n1). The guy carries his own weight, literally.\n\n2).  He keeps his complaints to himself.  He's not a toddler, no one is his Mommy.  No one wants their time ruined by whining.\n\n3). The guy helps out, give him a list of things he must do.\n\n4). The guy can stay home if he cannot pitch in.", "NTA, but you should have spoken up to make sure he\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t go and you all get to continue enjoying something you\u2019ve been enjoying for years.", "NTA It sounds like you had an awful time last time. You are the one that ended up having to carry that guys stuff for him, not her. Of course you wouldn't want to go on a miserable trip again. The insanity would be going knowing what you're in for. Your friend can be disappointed all she wants, but that is not your problem. Let her carry his back pack for him this time around.", "NTA. tell your friend that this guy put a damper on the trip for you last year and that it just wouldn\u2019t be worth it to go through that again. Your other friends might not have been bothered by it, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should suck it up for the sake of the group. Plus, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re saying either he goes or you go, you\u2019re just saying that putting up with him isn\u2019t worth it, so you\u2019re bowing out. \n\nI do have to say though, if he and your friend are serious, he\u2019ll probably be going on this trip for years to come so you\u2019ll either have to deal with it or just never go again.", "NAH\n\nYou generally aren't TA for declining an invitation to a social event. But just saying \"I can't make it\" instead of having a discussion with the group *is* stupid. It will do nothing to address the situation for this year or future years, and your friend obviously hopes her boyfriend will stick around.", ">  She said if I don\u2019t come she\u2019s going to be mad at me because my reason for not coming is stupid.   \n    \nNTA, I'd just tell your friend that you are sorry, but this camping trip has always been a way for you to relax and connect with friends, and the complaining and extra work involved make you not want to be there.  It ruins your vacation, and if people like that are going, you are better off going to another place to relax.", "NTA...  Tell her you will come, but she will be caring if bag.  Why can't ppl just take a \"no\" instead of being a$$holes about it", "NTA. I'm sorry you feel like you're getting butted out of your own tradition. It's not fair to have to take on more than your fair share, and that would definitely affect my enjoyment and future desire to go on a trip too. If others are fine with carrying his stuff for him, so be it. His personality and presence on the trip aren't things that can be avoided, so if that's what it boils down to for you, I can see why it's not worth going.\n\nThere might be ways to divide up the labor, however, in a way that feels more fair-- maybe he could do the dishes afterwards when he's feeling less winded, since others prepared the meal? Something like this would definitely need to be discussed prior so that there aren't any hard feelings down the line. Maybe as part of planning, tasks could be assigned in a non-partisan way, so that everyone's pulling their own weight while doing what they are capable of, and maybe your friend who's trying to pull strings to get you to come could help out with organizing this? Just a thought;)", "> She said if I don\u2019t come she\u2019s going to be mad at me because my reason for not coming is stupid.\n\nAnd her reason for getting mad at you is even more stupid. If you can't enjoy a trip, you don't go, that's just logic. Although I would be more public about it. Just say \"I just didn't enjoy last years trip as much as I enjoyed **all** the *previous* years, so I'm going to forgo this one.\" NTA", "Do you mean call him on it before committing to going? I hope so, otherwise OP's still going to end up listening to the whinging and carrying the cooler or the guy's pack, as will someone else, plus be out the travel money for it.\n\nOP, NTA.", "Yeah. Your friend is being childish and a total A, OP. You have every right not to go because you dread a repeat of last year. \n\nNTA", "That might be another reason why she's so eager for OP to go: making sure there are enough guys to pick up the slack.", "This. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you are making a drama out of this. You just don't want to have a repeat of last year. Having someone come along who isn't in shape is one thing, but to hear him constantly annoying is another!", "NTA but this is what's wrong  with some  friend groups. Instead of calling out the problem no one says anything and let's the issue fester. Then when one person complains they're made to be the bad guy. Tell your friend that she is welcomed to subject herself to endless whining and no help from a grown as man, you don't have to go anywhere. Tell her to have a great trip and you enjoy your whineless weekend.", "Your camping trip is for you and your people - people that pull their weight - to have fun. This guy doesn\u2019t pull his weight and will make the trip less fun. No brainer lol.\n\nIs the best friend the one dating him? Funny how she got mad at you, but said nothing to him but getting more in shape/pulling his weight.\n\nEnjoy your day in.", "NTA", "NTA. Just don\u2019t go.", "NTA.\n\nThe guy sounds like he's not cut out for the hiking/camping trip if he's that out of shape. It's perfectly fine to bow out on the trip knowing you'd end up carrying his gear, but for a second why not consider a compromise: you go, but whatever the guy doesn't want to carry can be brought to the campsite by his girlfriend/your friend.\n\nPut the burden of care on her and watch how she reacts. Her reaction would be all the justification you'd need.", "Camping is great once camp is all set up, food is cooked and you're sitting around a fire with a beer. If he doesn't have to carry his own gear, the cooler, or help with set up at all, why *wouldn't* he go?\n\n\nNTA OP. Freeloaders suck, no need to put up with them.", "NTA - I agree with what everyone else is saying. I also suspect your friend is worried that without you, who will carry the cooler? We all know it isn't going to be the BF, and you're not there to carry it alone.  She may be realizing just how much more work there will be without you.", "I had this same thought. Not that he has to go but personally, I would let them know I\u2019m hiking separately and let them sort out the extra weight amongst themselves since they don\u2019t seem to mind. And do your proportionate share of work at the camp and not volunteer to do more. Just sit and drink a beer and let his gf and others pick up the slack. If they give you the slightest pressure to pick up slack, say \u201cno, thank you\u201d and leave for an extra hike on your own. Learning how to channel your apathy can be a strength.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking as well. That\u2019s why I think he should go but hike in and out separately. Let them feel the burden of their decisions without him to help with the heavy lifting. And it\u2019s nice to hike alone! If OP hasn\u2019t tried it, I strongly recommend it. And he can do exactly his part around camp and then drink a beer and watch while others pick up the slack from the lazy bf", "NTA. But I say go and just don\u2019t carry a cooler with him. I also wouldn\u2019t carry his gear at all. Like, wtf?  Let his girlfriend pick up his slack.", "NTA but someone should speak up", "Just an additional thought to what folks have added here: Is this friend important to you and do you think this guy is someone she will be dating for a while? If so, I think there is a middle ground that could be explored here that would just require some open and honest communication. I think you could have a frank conversation with this person about where they feel comfortable ability wise and make accommodations to make the trip more pleasant for everyone. For instance, maybe the group could have a conversation ahead of time about splitting this guy's gear up among the group to carry in, and the guy could start the hike earlier than the rest of the group with his girlfriend to accommodate his pace. You could then organize a trade off -- since he can't carry gear in, he can chip in other ways (prepare meals, filter water etc). If he is someone who doesn't camp often, he may not have known how to help set up/cook and his partner could help him be more prepared ahead of this trip. It's completely up to you if these are the conditions under which you would like to take a vacation, but it is an option that would improve accessibility and also potentially lessen resentment around shared tasks.", "You\u2019d be the AH if you\u2019d publicly demanded that it\u2019s either you or the other guy. But you\u2019ve quietly dropped out, so totally NTA. You have no obligation to do something you don\u2019t enjoy, and your friend is being quite emotionally manipulative.", "NTA, why would you want to do something you know you\u2019re not going to have a good time doing? Sounds like a waste of time to me", "INFO with the guy now even more out of shape, does HE even want to go?", "NTA, as an adult we all have [choices.](https://choices.You) You simply made a choice.", "NTA. Tell her you will go if SHE is willing to carry that guy\u2019s pack and the cooler he dumped. And to help you duct tape his mouth shut.", "Probably gonna get downvotes to hell but ESH. \n\nYour friend for inviting her bf knowing he\u2019s physically unprepared/unable, the bf for coming along for a second year having seen the impact it had on you and your friends trip when you clearly didn\u2019t want to help him, and you and your group for not looking out for someone less able than yourselves. \n\nI know it sucks to have to carry someone else\u2019s load, but we\u2019re almost all going to be in that position eventually and it\u2019s a sad state to see someone being excluded over what you described yourself as an \u2018easy\u2019 hike. If it\u2019s that easy, helping another person shouldn\u2019t be an issue. Although I get that him complaining would be frustrating, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a lot more frustrating to him that he wants to be a part of the group but can\u2019t keep up or contribute in the same way the rest of you can.", "100%, women are not fainting daisies incapable of tasks requiring stamina", "I think OP brought up sex because they're small women carrying all their own gear. It was to contrast with the dude who complained.\n\nBut I agree that it was stupid.", "If she can\u2019t, that\u2019s a him problem", "Show up late and hike on your own and leave early so you dont have to put up with the nonsense during the hike.  Maybe even get your friend who is complaining that the only way you will go is if she goes early with you to setup camp and avoid the drama. You still have to be with him and the group but he stays on his own anyway. It sounds like the hike is the worst part.  Everybody is happy then.", "NTA. Tell her you'll go if she assumes full responsibility for any gear he can't carry, and for his share of the work in setting up the campsite. See if the tune changes.", "INFO: Can\u2019t you carry the cooler with someone else? I mean this guy only came last year, so presumably you had someone to partner with the year before. Or did someone else drop out?", "INFO, please: is the friend who's mad at you, the friend who is in a relationship with the ~~sad sack~~ guy  you are choosing to avoid?", "NTA but if I were you I'd bring it up to the whole group. That you'll only go if he carries his own weight and that no one babies him and he doesn't complain or he's kicked out and has to go home.", "NTA. But honestly, I\u2019d be honest in the group chat. \n\nThat this dudes attitude and complaining ruined it for you last year and your just not in the mood to deal with that on top of having to do more work because he doesn\u2019t do anything but run his mouth.", "NTA. Your reason for not going is stupid to her because *SHE* won't be carrying his gear when he gets winded.", "NTA. Don't downplay your feelings, to make up for someone else's. Start a dialogue. Talk about last year and how maybe it can be avoided. If it can't, or he won't grow a pair, Sorry can't make it. I tried.", "Rather than arguing with the friend or getting berated for making demands in a group chat - whats stopping you from heading in early? Like, just go 2 hours early, get your gear set up, and have a fire and food started. You already know it would be easier than literally carrying his weight and probably less than doing it with him there, even including the setup.", "NTA. But if you do go, maybe you and another guy can team up with a cooler and tell everyone you\u2019re going to go get a head start so you can start setting up and cooking since you didn\u2019t get there until after dark last year. That way you don\u2019t have to carry extra or listen to the guy the whole way", "NTA, I'd hate that guy, bad expedition behavior.", "NTA. Honestly? If he can\u2019t physically do his part he should not go. I can\u2019t imagine not carrying a cooler. I can see stopping for a break but just giving up?\n\n\nMy friend pissed me off when he wouldn\u2019t listen to me when I went camping. He also whined a lot", "Did the complainers gear have community gear or just his. If just his it should have been left where he dropped it", "Ask your friend if she is going to demonstrate her acceptance this year by carrying a cooler by herself.", "NTA, i'd suggest going to keep the peace with your friend and then give her a look every time he complains / annoys you just so she knows", "NTA, I still don't get how you think you're an asshole just because she's mad. It doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is supposed to be a fun trip, if she's the chief organizer of the event, and she's going to invite someone who's going to drag down the entire event because she's fucking him, what is the purpose of going?", "NTA - sucks that one stupid person ruined your trip for you.", "I politely disagree with this idea of listed demands (as-is) to present\u2014don\u2019t get me wrong they are all valid points and I like each of them, but, since the dude has already proven his inabilities/reluctance to contribute or even carry his own weight-I feel like this list will be ill received and cause further frustration and potential arguing. \n\nIf anything those issues should have been addressed at the end of the last trip and not at the forefront of this new one. I think OP, however, could present all of those points as reasons the joy and happiness were sucked out of the last trip, leading him to identify the reason he can\u2019t make it out. NTA for not wanting to go, but definitely try to speak up sooner", "I\u2019m willing to cut him a little slack the first year - not everybody knows what they are capable of, and he maaaay just have thought he can do it, he just doesn\u2019t like camping. (No allowance for the whining, he should have been very eager to pick up chores once he was on site and gotten his wind back). \n\nBut this year, either he doesn\u2019t go, he asks for accommodation and a less remote site (which people aren\u2019t compelled to agree to) or he sits it out. To go _knowing_ the group will have to baby him along is not fair on anyone else, and the complaints\u2026 I\u2019m not surprised OP does not want to go. \n\nI think OP needs to tell everyone in the group. \n\nI\u2019m usually all for accommodations, but this guy seems oblivious to the problems he\u2019s caused, and the complaining is on him alone. _That_ behaviour, not his inability to hike, would get him uninvited from any trip I\u2019m on.", "Aye so why are they forcing only the guys to carry coolers?", "To be fair, they did carry the guy's stuff last time and didn't make him do his fair share of setting up the camp. Why should OP have to go when they know it'll suck like last time? OP isn't obligated to attend, and they certainly aren't required to go just so that they can carry the guy's stuff and make him feel included?\nOP wants to go have a fun time, if the cons outweigh the pros then what's the point?", "Oh I totally appreciate that they did it the first time, but it didn\u2019t seem to be done out of any goodwill and with no understanding that what OP considers easy isn\u2019t easy for everyone. \n\nOP is under no obligation to go ofc, but basic decency to me means you include people regardless of their abilities (though I am physically disabled so definitely biased). \n\nIt absolutely sucks not being able to be included in stuff, especially when you\u2019re excluded through no fault of your own. It\u2019s just one of those things that are hard for everyone, but realistically OP could be hit by a car tomorrow and have similar struggles and I bet they\u2019d expect, or at least hope, that their group would help them to make the trip. \n\nWhile it\u2019s not technically OPs problem, a bit of compassion goes a very long way, and no one is guaranteed lifelong health or mobility.", "NTA.  What does \u201cbe more accepting\u201d mean, other than ignore the griping and carry more stuff?  Does anyone else in the group have reservations because of the new guy?  Why is your friend so angry with you when you have valid concerns?  She should offer viable solutions to the problems associated with the addition of the new guy (complaining and unfair distribution of workload).  Maybe everyone carries their own mini-cooler, food, and drinks along with their own gear.  Maybe you pitch in to hire someone to haul your heavy stuff back and forth.  \n\nRegardless, this is time for a serious conversation with the group.  Does that guy even enjoy the outing or is he just going for her?  Will the girlfriend go without him?  Frankly, your description makes him sound like he should not be 5 miles from an ER, much less 5 miles out in the wilderness.  \n\nWhatever happens, the \u2018good old days\u2019 of the original group outing are likely in the past.  I hope you salvage your friendships without sacrificing your own comfort level.  Good luck, OP.  I hope we get an update.", "NTA, clearly he's not even willing to try to keep up even a portion of the commitment he has to make in order to go on this trip.", "NTA. Your friend is for telling you that your reason is stupid. It\u2019s a very valid reason. No way would I want to go camping (or anywhere) with someone who complains the entire time.", "NTA", "you could go and be an ass to your Bestie's asshole BF though.\n\nhe cant carry his part of the cooler? \n\n\"oi bestie, help me out here. your BF is not doing his share.\"\n\nhe cant Carry his backpack? dont pick it up and let him suffer.  \n\nhe's being a whiny kid?\n\nrecord it and play it again and again.\n\ny'know, to give them a hint.\n\n\nlol\n\n\nyoure NTA OP", "Cant believe I had to scroll this far to find someone noting that. How much you wanna bet this guy just happens to be fat and actually wasn\u2019t even complaining as much as OP is making him out to, hence the friend\u2019s reaction?"]}
