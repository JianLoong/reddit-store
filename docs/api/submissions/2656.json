{"id": 2656, "submission_id": "yymfyc", "title": "AITA for not going on our traditional camping trip because of 1 guy?", "selftext": "So my friends and I have a traditional camping trip since our college days. It\u2019s nothing crazy and not at all a survival type situation but we do have to hike about 5 miles over uneven terrain and at a slight incline to get to the camping spot. It\u2019s not a rough hike at all because 2 people who usually go have asthma and they can do it while carrying their gear. Plus it\u2019s a mix group and there are women who are barely over 5\u2019 who can make this hike carrying their own gear.\n\nLast year a friend invited this guy she was dating along. This is a common practice so no one had any problems with it until we started the hike. The guy was complaining 5 minutes into the hike and kept it up the entire time. We also bring coolers of ice, food, and drinks. Usually the guys carry the coolers, 1 on each side. This dude was so winded walking, he gave up carrying his side of the cooler within sight of our cars. At this point I was already annoyed at his loud complaining and more so because I\u2019m stuck carrying a cooler by myself. Half way there, he couldn\u2019t make it with his pack so he took it off and another guy had to carry this dude\u2019s gear. We got to the camp site late and it was an hour after dark. I was tired, hungry, and in no mood for the dude. He was drenched in sweat, sat down, and did nothing while the rest of us set up the site and started to cook. I was annoyed for the rest of the time there but kept it to myself.\n\nOur camping trip is coming up and the dude and my friend are in a serious relationship. He\u2019s even more out of shape now than last year so I can already see repeat. When it came time to plan the trip, I opted out and said I can\u2019t make it. This is the 1st year I\u2019ve missed so there were questions. I didn\u2019t say anything to anyone but did tell my best friend because she was trying to work out all sorts of ways for me to go. She even offered to pay for my ticket because she thought it was a money issue. When I told her, she got offended and lectured me about how I need to be more accepting. I\u2019m accepting, I just don\u2019t want to hear him complain and carry his stuff because he can\u2019t. She said if I don\u2019t come she\u2019s going to be mad at me because my reason for not coming is stupid.\n\nNormally I wouldn\u2019t care but she\u2019s my best friend since college and I haven\u2019t seen her this mad at me before.", "created_utc": 1668784422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yymfyc/aita_for_not_going_on_our_traditional_camping/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The \"traditional camping trip\" doesn't work if one of the attendees can't walk to the camp site, and doesn't enjoy camping.\n\nThe dude is an AH - if he doesn't want to walk a few miles to a campsite, that's fine: this isn't something he has to enjoy. But he's an AH for knowing that he won't like it, agreeing to go, and then whining all the time.

It's not like you gave an ultimatum, either he goes or you do, you just opted to sit this one out. It's unfortunate that you are missing out on a tradition you enjoy with your friends, and it's kinda shitty that she's trying to blame you for her guilt.", "NTA.  You don't want to spend your vacation listening to this guy complain, doing his share of the work, and carrying his stuff.  I don't blame you for any of that.  It's a shame you miss out on the vacation though.  Is there a way for you to join the group the next day so you avoid the hike in with the AH?", "NTA there's no point in going on a trip that you won't enjoy", "NTA. At all. I used to be a part of an off road club and it was member invite only. We had big camps every year and it was amazing. Club became hugely popular so they just opened up to everyone. And unfortunately, it attracted a lot of the kinds of people I don't want to associate with, and then the politics of 2016 crept in and I was out. Last camp I went to was 2017 and the vibe had changed too much and although I had fun, it didn't feel nearly as safe or calm or relaxing or fun as it once had. \n\nI don't understand why he would want to go of he had such a horrible time.", "The comment about women being able to make the hike is really fucking sexist.\n\nI mountaineer and climb. The women in these communities would crush 99.9% of men in some stupid hike. Your size and gender has shit all to do with ones ability to hike.", "NTA. It's easy for your 'best friend' to be accepting when she didn't pay the price of have to carry his gear or carry a cooler by herself. You should be sure to inform the group that she has eagerly volunteered to pick up the slack for him in the future.", "NTA\n\nWhat does your friend want?  For you to gladly accept carrying someone else's gear on tip of your own while they complain the whole time?\n\nIf it's not enjoyable for you, don't go. It's not like you said \"if he goes, I won't go.\" You just took yourself out of the equation and only said so once your friend pushed for more info.", "This. Aside from anything else, it's not up to your friend whether or not you go. I'm assuming why she thinks you're not being accepting enough, but if you're annoyed and would irritated for a weekend you don't anyone your presence.", "He's coming this year because he was babied the entire time last year and will expect the same treatment this year.\n\nOP is smart, they know this, that's why they're refusing to go.", "I would say that not being able to carry your own stuff the 2nd time would make this guy the AH. The first time, ok, it's annoying but he could have thought he could do it. Now he knows.", "NTA\n\nHowever, you need to be honest with everyone.  Start a group chat and say that you would like to go if:\n\n1). The guy carries his own weight, literally.\n\n2).  He keeps his complaints to himself.  He's not a toddler, no one is his Mommy.  No one wants their time ruined by whining.\n\n3). The guy helps out, give him a list of things he must do.\n\n4). The guy can stay home if he cannot pitch in.", "NTA, but you should have spoken up to make sure he\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t go and you all get to continue enjoying something you\u2019ve been enjoying for years.", "NTA It sounds like you had an awful time last time. You are the one that ended up having to carry that guys stuff for him, not her. Of course you wouldn't want to go on a miserable trip again. The insanity would be going knowing what you're in for. Your friend can be disappointed all she wants, but that is not your problem. Let her carry his back pack for him this time around.", "NTA. tell your friend that this guy put a damper on the trip for you last year and that it just wouldn\u2019t be worth it to go through that again. Your other friends might not have been bothered by it, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should suck it up for the sake of the group. Plus, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re saying either he goes or you go, you\u2019re just saying that putting up with him isn\u2019t worth it, so you\u2019re bowing out. \n\nI do have to say though, if he and your friend are serious, he\u2019ll probably be going on this trip for years to come so you\u2019ll either have to deal with it or just never go again.", "NAH\n\nYou generally aren't TA for declining an invitation to a social event. But just saying \"I can't make it\" instead of having a discussion with the group *is* stupid. It will do nothing to address the situation for this year or future years, and your friend obviously hopes her boyfriend will stick around.", ">  She said if I don\u2019t come she\u2019s going to be mad at me because my reason for not coming is stupid.   \n    \nNTA, I'd just tell your friend that you are sorry, but this camping trip has always been a way for you to relax and connect with friends, and the complaining and extra work involved make you not want to be there.  It ruins your vacation, and if people like that are going, you are better off going to another place to relax.", "NTA...  Tell her you will come, but she will be caring if bag.  Why can't ppl just take a \"no\" instead of being a$$holes about it", "NTA. I'm sorry you feel like you're getting butted out of your own tradition. It's not fair to have to take on more than your fair share, and that would definitely affect my enjoyment and future desire to go on a trip too. If others are fine with carrying his stuff for him, so be it. His personality and presence on the trip aren't things that can be avoided, so if that's what it boils down to for you, I can see why it's not worth going.\n\nThere might be ways to divide up the labor, however, in a way that feels more fair-- maybe he could do the dishes afterwards when he's feeling less winded, since others prepared the meal? Something like this would definitely need to be discussed prior so that there aren't any hard feelings down the line. Maybe as part of planning, tasks could be assigned in a non-partisan way, so that everyone's pulling their own weight while doing what they are capable of, and maybe your friend who's trying to pull strings to get you to come could help out with organizing this? Just a thought;)", "> She said if I don\u2019t come she\u2019s going to be mad at me because my reason for not coming is stupid.\n\nAnd her reason for getting mad at you is even more stupid. If you can't enjoy a trip, you don't go, that's just logic. Although I would be more public about it. Just say \"I just didn't enjoy last years trip as much as I enjoyed **all** the *previous* years, so I'm going to forgo this one.\" NTA", "Do you mean call him on it before committing to going? I hope so, otherwise OP's still going to end up listening to the whinging and carrying the cooler or the guy's pack, as will someone else, plus be out the travel money for it.\n\nOP, NTA.", "Yeah. Your friend is being childish and a total A, OP. You have every right not to go because you dread a repeat of last year. \n\nNTA", "That might be another reason why she's so eager for OP to go: making sure there are enough guys to pick up the slack.", "This.
