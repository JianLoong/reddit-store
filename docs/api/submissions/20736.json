TBH I am not sure what should be done here since you did promise to split the costs, but at the end of the day it looks like he performed needlessly erratic behavior, and the action is fully a consequence of him", "No I didn't. Initially he was driving recklessly on the road, like taking tight corners at high speed and I told him to knock it off. So backing up like that was the only thing he was still \"allowed\" to do.\n\nI started driving after that because the girls were uncomfortable after we hit the pillar", "There was insurance, the damage maxed out the deductible. Both doors on the left side were wrecked and I assume had to be replaced. It probably would've been $4000-5000 without insurance.", "Nah, him intentionally driving like an idiot shouldn\u2019t warrant everyone else paying for his stupidity.", "OP added that the vehicle was insured and the 2k was the deductible.", "NTA. He should pay because this wasn't an ordinary oopsie; this was completely due to his careless behavior.", "Gotcha, then I vote NTA.", "OP stated in the post that they knew he drives like an idiot yet allowed him to drive anyway. I'd say that makes him complicit to me.  \n\n\nEdit: The friend should pay the fine; however, the collective group allowed him to drive despite knowing how he drives. Would you allow your friend to drive a car that isn't legally his if you knew he drove like an idiot?", "Then he's still the asshole as he agreed to the deductible upon taking the insurance.", "I am guessing since the friend got the invoice, they were technically the individual that rented the vehicle. I am personally for treating adults like adults and if they fuck up then it is their problem.", "So? Doesn\u2019t make anyone else complicit in his stupidity. Only he is to blame for that. If he wants to drive, he needs to take responsibility for when he fvcks up.", "He didn't agree to reckless driving so i don't agree, but you are entitled to your opinion.", ">Then he's still the asshole as he agreed to the deductible upon taking the insurance.\n\nNah, everything has implied limits. They were splitting gas with the expectation they would all be benefiting. If one of them took the car off on a joy trip and spent hundreds on gas, nobody would help pay for that.\n\nSimilarly, helping pay for accidents means helping pay for accidents that aren't your fault. If you do something obviously stupid, like ram the car into a  stationary concrete pillar, that's on you. Drivers have a responsibility, and on top of it all, the friend insisted that they do the driving.\n\nI would agree with you if the friend was coerced into driving, or if the accident wasn't his fault, or if there wasn't anything the friend could have done to prevent the accident. None of those apply to this situation.", "he did agree to it, after multiple instances of reckless driving  the day before he \"allowed\" him to back up..", "Nope. The only person to blame for driving like an idiot is the driver themselves.", "only if said idiot took the car without 3 other people's permission.   If he had the accident in the car alone, he'd be solely responsible..  They knew he was a bad driver they all agreed to let him drive and got in the car with him...   if he had hit a person all 4 would be charged with criminal negligence.", "LOL absolutely not!

Key term: \"...insisted on driving...\". His fault, his duty to pay up.", "It\u2019s the driver responsibility to make sure to check their surroundings when backing up and such. Now if it was an accident that\u2019s not anyone fault, I say you all should chip in but this is his fault. NTA", "NTA what is this thinking? If I drive I am responsible. If he drove through red does he expect you pay the bill too? Heck no. It\u2019s his fault and it sucks but that\u2019s his risk. He\u2019s lucky nobody got hurt, how ridiculous to put this on his passengers while he essentially put you all at risk.", "NTA.", "NTA since it was his driving that caused the accident, it's on him.", "NTA.

Or did anyone do Allianz?\n\nCheck those things too.", "NTA and this one is on him. \n\nMy friends and I had some windshield damage with a rental car in Iceland, which our credit card insurance too care of. But \u201cwe\u201d also got a speeding ticket around the ring road that was on my friend who was driving too fast after repeated warnings. We did end up splitting it with her out of courtesy but it wasn\u2019t anywhere near your 2000 Euros equivalent and she recognized we didn\u2019t have to do this.", "NTA. He was the one who drove the rental and damaged the vehicle. He is 100 percent responsible for the damages caused.", "NTA\n\nIt was due to his driving habits", "NTA!  The driver is responsible for his driving and the accidents he causes and the resultant property damage.  Your presence in the car does not make you liable for damages.", "NTA.  But at the same time, stop splitting costs/responsibilities with people who you know are going to end up with these charges, and stop letting him do insane shit while you and your GF are in the vehicle. \n\nHitting the pole is the *best* thing that could have happened, what if he killed someone and yall were stuck with an impounded vehicle and an arrested friend in a foreign country?  And a whole-ass dead person?  If he couldn't see a concrete bollard he certainly wouldn't notice someone approaching on a bike or some kid or something.", "Are you splitting damage cost four or two ways?

There are a bunch of countries over here. Most have different languages", "Once upon a time, the rental car guy in Ireland told us that they didn\u2019t look at side scratches. Scratching the sides against bushes or sheep was totally normal and there was no reliable method of differentiation between users.

Or got a speeding ticket. \n\nNTA", "> ALWAYS get insurance through the rental agency if your policy/credit card doesn't cover it.\n\nfirst time i rented a car i got the insurance and did this exact thing - backed into a pole and fucked the rear bumper. dropped it off, explained what happened, they said \"oh looks like you got the insurance, no problem, have a nice day sir\" and i left\n\nALWAYS. for sure.", "There are also a lot of reputable third party insurers for this purpose (in Europe, at least) who will give you more comprehensive coverage at a far better rate than the rental agency.", "No the split cost was referring to the rental price", "This is not declined coveragey it's an insurance policy where you pay all damages up to a certain amount (here: 2000)", "absolutely not. he caused the damage being a reckless driver, he's responsible for the payment with or without Insurance", "I would expect that if someone was kind enough to drive a group of us somewhere, and something happened, we'd help them out.  Even if it was marginally their fault, like not seeing a warning sign in time that none of the rest of us saw either.\n\nIf dude was checking his phone and rolled the car and put us all into the hospital, not so much.\n\nThis isn't as clear-cut, but grabbing the keys and saying you'd drive because you'd driven in Europe before and then backing up into a bollard at full speed is pretty AH behavior.  And in a car that everybody was already paying for.\n\nI guess part of it would depend on how dear that $2K was to everybody.  If Mario Andretti there was rolling in the dough, I'd be more likely to let him deal with the consequences of his stupidity.  If he was gonna be unable to pay his rent, I'd be a little more likely to step up.\n\nThis feels closer to the line, but NTA.", "And even drive on different sides of the road!", "I take back my TLD comment about this, you did the right thing in all respects.", "okay, we get it. you're the asshole who couldn't back out of the parking spot without  destroying the car you were driving. sorry to say, but the damage is solely your Responsibility", "Most places, when you rent a car, only the driver/drivers listed on the rental agreement is legally allowed to drive the car. Based on some of OP's comments, it sounds like the friend was the only one on the rental agreement and they didn't know how reckless a driver he was until after they were there and he was driving. \n\nAlso, I have never heard of a case where the passengers in a vehicle are charged for criminal negligence when the driver hits someone; that would make no sense at all."]}
