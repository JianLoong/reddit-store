It\u2019s on him to pay for that damage.", "NTA, I agree with what you said.  It was the fault of the one driving which makes it his responsibility.  If you are going to insist on driving and then drive poorly that's on you dude.  If  he was driving diligently and there was like you said a freak accident than yes you should share the cost but sounds like it was his AH driving skills that caused the accident.", "He drives like an asshole and his wallet should bear the consequences.

He pays.", "Info:\n\nYou mentioned the costs were being split equally & he's trying to get your gf to pay now.

TBH I am not sure what should be done here since you did promise to split the costs, but at the end of the day it looks like he performed needlessly erratic behavior, and the action is fully a consequence of him", "No I didn't. Initially he was driving recklessly on the road, like taking tight corners at high speed and I told him to knock it off. So backing up like that was the only thing he was still \"allowed\" to do.\n\nI started driving after that because the girls were uncomfortable after we hit the pillar", "There was insurance, the damage maxed out the deductible. Both doors on the left side were wrecked and I assume had to be replaced. It probably would've been $4000-5000 without insurance.", "Nah, him intentionally driving like an idiot shouldn\u2019t warrant everyone else paying for his stupidity.", "OP added that the vehicle was insured and the 2k was the deductible.", "NTA. He should pay because this wasn't an ordinary oopsie; this was completely due to his careless behavior.", "Gotcha, then I vote NTA.", "OP stated in the post that they knew he drives like an idiot yet allowed him to drive anyway. I'd say that makes him complicit to me.  \n\n\nEdit: The friend should pay the fine; however, the collective group allowed him to drive despite knowing how he drives. Would you allow your friend to drive a car that isn't legally his if you knew he drove like an idiot?", "Then he's still the asshole as he agreed to the deductible upon taking the insurance.", "I am guessing since the friend got the invoice, they were technically the individual that rented the vehicle. I am personally for treating adults like adults and if they fuck up then it is their problem.", "So? Doesn\u2019t make anyone else complicit in his stupidity. Only he is to blame for that. If he wants to drive, he needs to take responsibility for when he fvcks up.", "He didn't agree to reckless driving so i don't agree, but you are entitled to your opinion.", ">Then he's still the asshole as he agreed to the deductible upon taking the insurance.\n\nNah, everything has implied limits. They were splitting gas with the expectation they would all be benefiting. If one of them took the car off on a joy trip and spent hundreds on gas, nobody would help pay for that.\n\nSimilarly, helping pay for accidents means helping pay for accidents that aren't your fault. If you do something obviously stupid, like ram the car into a  stationary concrete pillar, that's on you. Drivers have a responsibility, and on top of it all, the friend insisted that they do the driving.\n\nI would agree with you if the friend was coerced into driving, or if the accident wasn't his fault, or if there wasn't anything the friend could have done to prevent the accident. None of those apply to this situation.", "he did agree to it, after multiple instances of reckless driving  the day before he \"allowed\" him to back up..", "Nope. The only person to blame for driving like an idiot is the driver themselves.", "only if said idiot took the car without 3 other people's permission.   If he had the accident in the car alone, he'd be solely responsible..  They knew he was a bad driver they all agreed to let him drive and got in the car with him...   if he had hit a person all 4 would be charged with criminal negligence.", "LOL absolutely not! If he wants to drive, then he gets to take responsibility for his fvck ups while driving. Also no, only the driver would be charged in your fictional scenario."]}
