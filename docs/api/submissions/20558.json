So I awkwardly stood off to the side for a few a bit as they played with the tag I wanted to read. When I hit the point were it was potentially odd for a grown adult to stare at a child, I decided to step closer and ask them to stop pulling on the labels and pushed the label back down so I could read it.\n\nThe price was like $6 because it was one of those fake 'here's the normal price' tags and nothing else was on special, so I moved on.\n\nI went a few metres over and was looking through the frozen desserts when someone, who I presume was the child's father, came up and commented that I should never touch his kid again or someone was going to get hurt. They also commented something about their son helping stick on the price tag, so I may have mis-understood what was happening somehow. It didn't look like they were doing anything as they had half peeled it off and stuck it back on a few times, but maybe they were trying to make it more straight and I didn't realise.\n\nI wasn't exactly paying attention to what the father(?) said because I had just found a frozen cheesecake so I kind of waved them off with a half muttered sorry without really listening to them.\n\nI don't blame them for this reaction as I am tall and likely had come across as threatening. Now I wasn't in a rush or anything, so I could've just gone and gotten the other things on my list and come back later. They likely would've moved on by that point and there would've been no issue at all. I also could've just kept my mouth shut.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I did not actually touch them.

Their brains are not fully formed, function quite differently than an adult brain does, and perceive the world very differently than do adults. This is a biological and scientifically proven fact. In Victorian times, it was thought that children were just little adults. The result of that type of thinking is often the child is abused when they cannot (understandably) act like the little adults, or \u201clittle humans,\u201d society deemed them to be. They cannot communicate as adults can.\nParents need to protect their children by training them how to properly function in society. That is impossible to do if the child is allowed to run feral and be a nuisance to other adults.\nIt sounds like the father wanted it both ways. He wanted to let his child run around unsupervised but also didn\u2019t want other adults to \u201cparent\u201d his child. The father\u2019s anger stems from lack of parenting. He just happened to have another adult to take his anger out on in this situation. Next time, it could be an inanimate object that negatively impacts his child\u2019s existence as he roams areas without a parent.", "[removed]", "Ok then I\u2019m actually gonna go with NTA.
