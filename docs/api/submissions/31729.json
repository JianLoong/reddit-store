Standing your ground is a must, but diagnosing a problem that is 20-30 years old based on recollections from a person you disagree with is a slippery slope. There could have been any number of issues other than her not feeding them enough. You\u2019re likely right, but it\u2019s too sensitive a topic and you don\u2019t know everything.

It would be difficult to outright say she did a horrible job raising kids when she raised the guy you love, and who actually stands up to her. \n\nJust bask in your husbands glow of his shiny spine and let him deal with his circus.", "Yes I think you're right. I need to adapt my style. She senses my weakness haha.", "Honestly yeah, that sounds like something I might have to do. Just repeat ad nauseum. Thanks!", "Yeah I've already asked him to cut down the amount of time we're there so now it's usually a 4-6 hr visit when it used to be all day/all weekend. He feels guilty like he has to take care of her since the other kids all moved away. Someone else suggested me not going each time and that's something I'll keep in mind.", "Honestly I think she feels like she's \"helping\" or that she feels the \"need to be needed\" so I'm trying to think of other ways I can have her feel helpful or needed that aren't just shaming our parenting and giving unsolicited advice.", "Husband feels he needs to take care of her as she's old and the other kids all moved away.", "Unsolicited advice is annoying because it shows that the other person thinks, he/she is somehow superior in his/her knowlege. \n\n\"I'm better than you, that's why I know exactly what to do in your situation, although I hardly know anything about your situation because you are so dumb, that you don't get the easy answers, I figured out in the 2 minutes I watchted you, yourself!\"", "Yeah that's why I said I'm mostly venting at the end. And I asked for other ideas. Since she goes on about this for hours every time we see her, it's getting very old, repetitive, and more than just a bit annoying. What would you say?\n\nETA: but I do agree, not everything needs a response. It's very draining and like I said, I don't get much sleep, so it feels a bit like being constantly kicked when I'm down.", "Thanks, yeah I agree. I won't be saying anything to her, venting here really did help.\n\nAnd while there's other medical context that makes it pretty clear that's what was happening, I'm trying to keep things somewhat anonymous. Every time I'm feeding my baby, she'll say to the baby \"you're not hungry already\" or \"you're eating too much.\" And she tries to tell me not to feed the baby. I keep saying some version of, \"if they're hungry, feed them. Growing babies need to eat.\"\n\nHonestly typing it out is making me sad that my baby even has to hear this harmful talk. But hopefully my voice is louder in defending him.", "That's what I do currently say. She just ignores it and repeats how things went for her.\n\nIt is speculating, but I'm 99% sure that's what happened. There's other medical stuff that happened that's pretty clear. I'm trying to keep it somewhat anonymous. \n\nShe's also someone who thinks smoking is healthy and smoked during her pregnancies, if that gives you some more context.", "Hahaha that's awesome. Yeah, it really helps that he's aware of the issues.", "Obviously I know nothing about the situation other than what you've told me. I can tell you I had a meddlesome MIL, though. Because I was young when I married, she decided that meant I was not intelligent. She did two wonderful things for me, though. One, she gave birth to my husband, who is a good man. And two, she died before we had children.  \n\n\nI hope you can work the situation out without feeling like you're not doing it right and without her getting shrill and aggravating.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, congrats on the baby. Mine are all grown now, but I so enjoyed them as babies and toddlers and grade schoolers and teenagers. Every age and every stage was wonderful and I am so glad for them.", "Let him take care of her at her place. YOu do not have to join him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand DON'T makle the error of letting him move her in with you. YOur sanity and your marriage would not survive that.", "Thank you! That's basically a big part of it, I'm not asking for her advice so it's constantly unsolicited. I do feel like she's feeling the \"need to be needed\" and I've tried to think of things that maybe she could give me advice on.", "**Do you live with her?** If not, then how often can she so frequently have your attention for \"hours\" to yammer about this?\n\nIf you have passed the point of just changing the topic, nodding along, rolling your eyes, or saying something generic like \"I'm looking forward to the toddler years\" then maybe you need to *reduce the amount of hanging-out time* you spend with your MIL.", "But you don't need to bring her parenting into it.  Just tell her this is how you're raising your kids and you don't want any unsolicited advice. That said, you probably can't being up any complaints about it because then you're opening the door for advice.", "They live in a neighboring municipality. We used to go every two months and stay the weekend. That would be so draining, I finally asked my husband if we could go more often (every couple weeks) but not stay the night. So we end up visiting about 4-6 hours, and let me tell you, it's the entire time (give or take small changes in conversation). It's very hard to get her to change the subject! She will just ignore you and keep repeating what she wants to say. \n\nI do try most of what you're saying. I don't think she picks up on conversation cues. \n\nMy husband feels obligated to see her and take care of her, since the other kids all moved away. I get that and I'm trying to be supportive... I kind of get why they moved away though lol.", "That's way too much time. If he wants to spend that time away from you and your kids, and you agree, then fine. But there's no reason anyone else has to go.", "I appreciate that perspective. I will consider that as an option if I'm feeling like I can't deal with it ahead of time next time!", "If she doesn\u2019t stop after you tell her together one more time STOP GOING. Just stop. It\u2019s torture, why would you put yourself through this??"]}
