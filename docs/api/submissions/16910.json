Silence is golden, but block caller is priceless!", "But the father in all this where is it?", "ESH\n\nThe issue here (as I see it) isn't about having kids, its about making wise or selfish decisions with how to spend your time and resources. The friend (as far as OP has made us aware) is choosing not to do what is necessary for what she is responsible. Its not about \"having too many kids\", its about asking for handouts instead of sucking it up and finding a dirty job that pays the bills. That said, \"the poor you have with you always\" and there will always be people who struggle to make ends meet; and its not always their fault nor are they destined for misery and failure. Based on what OP has said, I can't pass judgement on whether the mom could reasonably find work to provide for her children. Its not evil to ask for help, especially when you're doing it for your family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut the biggest question in all of this is: where is dad?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain, this points not to her decision to have children, but whom she chose as their father/her partner. If she keeps picking men who have no intention of raising children, *that* is a character issue that needs to be resolved. Address the root issue, don't make it about her kids (its not). Boundaries need to be set in any relationship but stating she just needs to stop having kids isn't setting the right boundary. And perhaps there's even a way to provide non-financial support? Point her to resources; all those pro-life friends surely know about pregnancy centers, support groups, etc. that can provide a lot of those basics like diapers, clothes, finance classes, etc. There are even maternity houses for people in this kind of situation where they can learn life skills and even a trade! The caveat is most of those organizations have strict guidelines and boundaries which *perhaps* is why the mom hasn't used them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr Address her root heart-issues and decision-making; don't make it about her kids. Set clear boundaries.", "Soft YTA, only because she obviously knows what is making them at #3 so at this point it's not really helping since she's purposely choosing to avoid birth control. \n\nThe best thing you can do for her is to stop enabling her and giving her money.

Your friend needs to be responsible enough to not have more kids when she can't afford it and it's really weird she expects her community to fund her literal life decisions, AND your delivery was harsh and lacked emotional intelligence. She's unlikely to change her ways when you criticize and confront her like that even if you're right, which means that was an ineffective and hurtful approach. Nothing will change that way. \n\nBoundaries here could look like this: \"I can't imagine how hard your situation is right now. Unfortunately, I'm unable to provide support like that right now.\"  \n\nIt's okay to disagree with someone's life decisions, and to say no when they ask for help. It's not going to end well when you criticize them, nor is it productive. It's not going to inspire her to change, change her sincerely held beliefs, or undo her irresponsible behavior. You can only control your life.", "Maybe ESH? It wasn't nice but you're not wrong.", "Yta. I understand your frustration. What you said seems to make logical sense. It would be ok to withdraw support. The rest is not your business and you don't have a right to tell another person when and how they should handle their medical care. You would not be wrong for explaining to her that you don't have enough money to help her, giving her resources for community help, etc.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her failure to plan does not constitute an emergency for you.  While I\u2019m all for it takes a village. Thats not whats happening here.  She is just mooching off the kindness of ur friendship.

First off, you guys are 20, what money does she expect you to have also?\n\nSecond, instead of giving money, see if there any organizations or welfare programs that can help. I got pregnant off birth control and got connected with a lot for assistance. It'll be better to connect her with people who can help. Plus, most cities have a diaper bank, some even several! I've had two \"baby showers\" provided by different organizations and got a free stroller out of it!\n\nThe situation is going to continue to get worse, she is going to lose her friends and has already lost her family, and pretty soon everyone around her will think she's a leech. If any of her baby daddies decide they want to be more involved, they'd have an easy case for custody based on what you described, especially if they can provide better. I can't imagine she can afford a good lawyer, either. Seriously, even working minimum wage, she would qualify for daycare assistance from any state!! \n\nShe also needs a reality check. I have several friends who have social media status, and I promise you that they all have another job along with. So that was dumb.\n\nShe needs a reality check soon before her children suffer more because of her inability to take care of them.", "NTA. Have the amount of children you can afford to give a decent life to. Being pro life does not affect you taking/using BC. She is going to have CPS taking the children off of her.

That\u2019s because reliable family planning tools made it possible for people to climb out of multigenerational poverty and enabled women to live their own lives.

It has to do with conception, abstinence, etc. They (and they were formally speaking on behalf of their pro-birth organization) think birth control is a plague on American culture because it turns women into floosies. That's what I was told.", "My only assumption is that her friends are the few extreme cases of pro life. Unfortunately in some small groups people believe that any sort of birth control-even condoms- are of the devil because \u201cit meddles with god\u2019s intentions of you having babies\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s your duty as a women to provide life\u201d. It\u2019s horrible thinking with STDs and life threatening complications being possibilities", "Naa man, you're NTA. You gave her a dose of reality that she needed to hear a long time ago.\n\nSometimes being a good friend isn't about saying the right thing, its about saying the true thing.", "Many of the loudest and most stringent pro-life/anti-choice political advocates and organizations are anti birth control. In many instances, they try to make arguments that birth control/Plan B counts as an abortifacent (because many types of birth control, in addition to preventing ovulation, make the uterus inhospitable to a fertilized egg to prevent implantation - so HYPOTHETICALLY, in case you ovulate and have sex and an egg is fertilized, lowers the chances that the fertilized egg implants in the uterus and becomes a pregnancy. HOWEVER, literally, physically, scientifically, pregnancy does not begin until the egg implants in the uterus, so it's LITERALLY NOT AN ABORTION IF THIS HAPPENS!!!! Fertilized eggs can pass normally through periods with or without birth control.)\n\nANYWAY, sorry, got off track. Just wanted to chime in and say that pro-lifers who are anti-BC and try to pretend it's about abortion are just liars. It's always about controlling people's reproductive choices and sex lives. Meanwhile young women like OP's friend are ruining their lives because they're brainwashed with all this bullshit.", "I have heard of it, just not associated with pro-life before. I think I\u2019ve heard it commonly believed by people in the Catholic Church, but I also know people that are pro-life and still think you should be able to use contraceptive. Never made sense to me to just have 15 kids or risk an STD for something so trivial."]}
