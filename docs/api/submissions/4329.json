He was someone she knew who was willing to let her have a child to raise herself. When I was 12 mom met her husband. Her husband had a 17 year old daughter at the time. Her husband and his daughter were dicks and mom threw me in at the deep end and she thought I'd see this dude as  my dad because I never had one before. Even at 12 I knew a guy who commented on how I didn't smile like a girl should and who commented on my weird interests for a girl was never going to be worthy of being called my parent, let alone my dad. His daughter taunted me for having no dad and for not being cute enough when my donor didn't fall in love with me and decide to be my dad. I asked her if she understood what a sperm donor was. She told me someone who makes freaks.\n\nWhen I was 16 her husband's daughter moved back in with her boyfriend and their kids. I was then forced to babysit after school and sometimes on the weekends because they either couldn't be bothered or nobody wanted to pay. I did the bare minimum of babysitting and I did not grow attached to those children in the twoish years I babysat them. I wanted nothing to do with babysitting them but figured I could at least game when home with them rather than being grounded.\n\nI moved out and cut my mom off because she chose a husband who was a dick to me and kept me around him and his daughter who was also a dick to me.\n\nI have nothing to do with any of them.\n\nA few months ago my sperm donor died and I learned he left all his assets to me. It was a lot of money and a house that I sold, which got me a lot of money. My mom learned about this via mutual friends and she reached out and told me how much they have struggled financially since their house burned down two years ago (I had heard about that at the time) and how her step grandkids are looking at a really bad Christmas and how great it would be if I, as their aunt, her daughter and part of the family bought gifts for the kids. I told her she and her stepgrandkids are not my family and were not owed any money from me and that I would like it if she did not make me change another number (she called me on a business number I have). She asked me how I could be so cold and even if I resent her, how could I say that about the niece and nephew I spent every day with for two years and who looked up to and adored me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670600157, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zh0de9/aita_for_telling_my_mother_that_she_and_her/", "score": 3949, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
