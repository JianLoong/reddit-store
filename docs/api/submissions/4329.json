He was someone she knew who was willing to let her have a child to raise herself. When I was 12 mom met her husband. Her husband had a 17 year old daughter at the time. Her husband and his daughter were dicks and mom threw me in at the deep end and she thought I'd see this dude as  my dad because I never had one before. Even at 12 I knew a guy who commented on how I didn't smile like a girl should and who commented on my weird interests for a girl was never going to be worthy of being called my parent, let alone my dad. His daughter taunted me for having no dad and for not being cute enough when my donor didn't fall in love with me and decide to be my dad. I asked her if she understood what a sperm donor was. She told me someone who makes freaks.\n\nWhen I was 16 her husband's daughter moved back in with her boyfriend and their kids. I was then forced to babysit after school and sometimes on the weekends because they either couldn't be bothered or nobody wanted to pay. I did the bare minimum of babysitting and I did not grow attached to those children in the twoish years I babysat them. I wanted nothing to do with babysitting them but figured I could at least game when home with them rather than being grounded.\n\nI moved out and cut my mom off because she chose a husband who was a dick to me and kept me around him and his daughter who was also a dick to me.\n\nI have nothing to do with any of them.\n\nA few months ago my sperm donor died and I learned he left all his assets to me. It was a lot of money and a house that I sold, which got me a lot of money. My mom learned about this via mutual friends and she reached out and told me how much they have struggled financially since their house burned down two years ago (I had heard about that at the time) and how her step grandkids are looking at a really bad Christmas and how great it would be if I, as their aunt, her daughter and part of the family bought gifts for the kids. I told her she and her stepgrandkids are not my family and were not owed any money from me and that I would like it if she did not make me change another number (she called me on a business number I have). She asked me how I could be so cold and even if I resent her, how could I say that about the niece and nephew I spent every day with for two years and who looked up to and adored me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670600157, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zh0de9/aita_for_telling_my_mother_that_she_and_her/", "score": 1013, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stick to your guns and ignore her rewriting of history to suit herself. \n\nThat\u2019s a really touching thing your donor has done and you should make the most of your own opportunities and life as he hoped.", "They treated you terribly, and they haven\u2019t reached out between when you moved out and when they heard you have money. That answers everything I need to know here - NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. So many people on here are really awful to person A. Then person A comes into some money and suddenly \u201cso many people\u201d want forgiveness and a fAmiLY.", "NTA \n\nYour mother failed you. Your stepfather and daughter bullied you and used you. I am not surprised that you feel no familial connection or obligation to these people.\n\nI feel sorry for their children. I suppose you could send them the contact information for toys for tots or the Salvation Army or any similar programs so they can do what other people who can\u2019t afford gifts do for their children. Maybe if they try they can do better for this set of kids.", "NTA you are right to cut them off. They don't care about you but they sure are trying to exploit you.", "NTA. Sperm donor knew mom. If he wanted to get any of his money he would have left some in his will for her. He didn't. That said it all. NTA and enjoy the leg up after an awful childhood at the hands of your mother.", "NTA - I know this sounds elitist, but there are presumably multiple working age adults in their home. Why are they asking you for money?", "NTA! You can\u2019t chose family but you can chose to cut off toxicity for your mental and emotional health. The nerve of her.", "NTA. Damn, your mom is a piece of work. The audacity of even daring to beg you for money... Just, wow.", "They only care when moneys involved. Ha. NTA", "NTA!!! The have what they deserve", "NTA. It's so sick how she wants to use you now and have you around just because you have money. Christmas can still be made without gifts and material items. Just because they are family doesn't mean that you have an obligation to make them your permanent responsibility. Good for you for setting boundaries.", "NTA you don\u2019t owe her anything. She chose some other persons kids over her own child. Block her and if she keeps harassing you get a restraining order. They\u2019re not your family Anyways, they\u2019re just the people you were stuck with because your mother chose to marry someone with children.\n\nYou should tell your mother that she\u2019s the one that chose some other guya children that are not hers over her own child, and did nothing when her own child was being abused. She let her husband treat you terribly, and did nothing to protect you. Ask her what kind of mother does that?", "They looked up to you while you were forced to babysit them? NC is exactly right and NTA.", "Oh, so now you have value to her... financial value... and she has the audacity to call you \"cold\".  \nNTA", "NTA lol no", "NTA and\u2026.. bwahahahaha karma baby!   Please don\u2019t give give in and give any of them so much as a penny.  They treated you like filth, and would continue to treat you like filth if you hadn\u2019t suddenly become wealthy.  They deserve absolutely nothing from you.", "NTA tell her you\u2019ll give back all the babysitting money\u2026 oh wait", "Nta- hugs", "NTA. You owe them nothing.", "NTA.", "Nta, dude, wtf is up with step families? They sound like horror stories.", "NTA", "NTA, your bio father didn't give the money to your mother ir her family, tell her to pound sand.", "NTA.  She's only reaching out because you have something she wants.  Tell them to get jobs and a second if they need to provide for these kids.", "Nta you were forced to babysit.", "Tell them you want back pay for all that babysitting.", "NTA. Go on with your life. It's time for good things for you now.", "Fu\u20ack them all. Enjoy your holidays and let them drown in their karma!", "NTA and I\u2019m sure once the moneys gone, so will she", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA. Your mom allowed her husband and his bratty teen to verbally and emotionally abuse you. Then made you babysit her kids when she\u2019s 21. Nope. You do you, take care of yourself. They made their bed and they can sleep in it .", "NTA but you\u2019re also not, like, a good person.", "I would do something for the kids...\n\nIn the OP shoes I would set up a sizable college trust with all the stipulations that come with a higher education trust. That way the people who actually want the money have no access to it whatsoever and they get to know it's sitting there out of their reach for all time. \ud83e\udd23\n\nNTA", "NTA, but don't waste your breath asking her why she never stood up for you. You'll never get the answers you're looking for and if there is an apology it won't be sincere. Just continue no contact and enjoy your life.", "He also might have realized mom was a neglectful AH and wanted to make sure this poor person was taken care of", "He might have had any other next of kin.", "Yeah, I wonder this too.  Honestly it feels more like mom is mad all his money went to OP instead of her and is now trying to weasel in on it.", "how are they not, like, a good person?", "She owes these leaches nothing", "Doormat=/=good person.  It just makes them enable bad behavior.  If anything, OP is doing them the favor of making them understand their bad manipulative and abusive behavior =/= monetary payouts.", "Why, \u2018cause she didn\u2019t drop everything and take care of tHe PwEcIoUs BaBiEs?", "It\u2019s also odd he would leave everything to OP as well though. That\u2019s also not really how sperm donors work. Which is why people are surprised there was no attempt to form a relationship between them.", "I think I'd snap \"what kind of woman uses kids as meat shields to hide from her own failures!\"  NTA.", "Trouble is, it\u2019s usually that very trauma that makes it hard to see clearly how awful they are and how you deserve better- like a double-edged sword where both sides catch the victim\u2026 \n\nYou are totally right, of course, it\u2019s just that manipulation and devaluation can make it hard to stand up confidently against another onslaught. Hopefully OP will ignore any contact and live happily without her so-called mother."]}
