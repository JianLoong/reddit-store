Nina is not short but she\u2019s willowy. She looks very delicate and fine-boned. Nina has been doing a couple forms of martial arts since she was 7 or 8.\n\nA couple days ago I took Nina with me to pick up a few things at my uncle\u2019s. My cousin Ted arrived early from another city so we stayed so I could catch up with them a bit. Everyone welcomed Nina and asked her how was her life in another city and her hobbies and whatnot.\n\nMy cousins Ted (22m) and Cole (17m) were openly staring when Nina told them she does martial arts. Ted used to wrestle in high school and Cole is on his school\u2019s varsity football team. They said it was great she took martial arts to defend herself but suggested a couple objects she could use against \u201creally big, strong guys\u201d she may be unable to handle.\n\nNina said sizes don\u2019t matter and she can protect herself against attackers of all kinds.\n\nAgain, Ted and Cole stared at her and asked if she seriously thought she could protect herself against someone their sizes. Ted was 6\u20194 and Cole was 6\u20193, both over 200 lbs.\n\nNina said yes.\n\nCole then asked Nina to go to the living room and told her to try to fend him off. We watched as Nina dodged Cole\u2019s grab until he managed to hold her ankle and brought her down. She tripped him in return and tried to shake him off while he tried to pull her to him. In the process they pulled the rug which upset a table, knocking it into another table and the vase on it fell to the floor, broken.\n\nMy aunt came downstairs and gave everyone involved a scolding, telling them the house was no place for a fight. She then said Cole and I owed her a new vase.\n\nI told her this was all on Cole who suggested they fight in the first place. Cole also said it was on him, but my aunt wouldn\u2019t have it. She said this was a teaching moment for Nina to own up to her mistakes. Nina offered to pay but I refused to let her.\n\nTed stepped in and said he got his mom a new vase for Christmas so this was perfect timing and there was no need to make this a big deal. Nina and I left and my boyfriend agreed we shouldn\u2019t have to pay. My aunt later called me and said I was being selfish and that the vase wasn\u2019t even that expensive but it was the principles of things that when you broke stuff, you need to take responsibilities.

Yeah right.\n\n(I want to be clear, I think women are more than capable of competing in combat sports, but there's no way to bridge a 100 pound gap even if they were the same gender).\n\n\nEdit to add: LOL at the downvotes from all the people angry that they fell for a bullshit story and don\u2019t like that their fantasy is invalid.", "She wasnt being attacked. This was an agreed on playfight", "Sheesh. Takes two to tango. To frame it like she was being attacked is what a crazty person would do.", "Ultimately, martial arts are *combat* sports and I\u2019ve never been to a class that hasn\u2019t driven home the point that you\u2019re not supposed to use it as a *first resort* outside of class; your first option should be to run. Just because it\u2019s not the main reason a person is attending doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t necessarily a core element of why they ended up there.\n\nThis goes doubly so for women-specific martial arts classes. If they aren\u2019t specifically branded as sports/competition classes, they are going to explain ways to use their teachings for self-defence, because that *is* why many start women going to them. Even for self-defence, you *need* to continue going to class to practice those skills, because you want them to be there when you need them.", "What a strange comment. That\u2019s just categorically untrue.", "Yes exactly. Yet she sat there thinking she could take a heavier and bulkier man. Better this lesson is learned in a safe environment that no, most likely, you cannot.\n\nAgility is your advantage and you can Dodge, sure, but once they grab your the power is... Something else.", "Everyone knows that **any physical activity whatsoever** can lead to broken objects.", "I mean, I'm 33, and sometimes I act like a 9 year old. If you think 15 year olds and 17 year olds are incapable of immaturity, you're an idiot.\n\nAlso, there's no part of the story where a willowy 15 year old did anything against two boys over 6 foot 3 and 200 pounds \n\nFan fiction you say, but you're making up details and imparting your own boring personality onto all of the characters?", "My kids in their mid twenties AND their spouse would totally act like this. It\u2019s a freaking zoo when they come home to influence the other actual kids.", "It\u2019s not angry. I can\u2019t speak for everyone else but in my case, it gets old that every post has to be questioned now because some people feel smug when they can snarkily be like \u201cthis story is totally fake hahaha, you don\u2019t realize that???\u201d\n\nThere are lots of fake stories. Yes, we know. \n\nNow probably you\u2019ll respond with some condescending explanation of your expertise in teenager behavior and the superiority of big men fighting thin women.", ">Late teenagers don't act like 9 year olds. This sounds like boomer fan fiction.\n\nhave you ever met a teenager? I've had a bunch of 17 year old boys climb flag poles for fun and were shocked when they got into trouble for it", "i feel like you dont understand how martial arts work", "-Age doesn't equal maturity. There are adults who do this shit. Do you know how many college kids put holes in walls rough housing? \n\n-If you read it, you prove your own point. Nina didn't get a singular good hit in. She dodged for a while and when Cole got her down, she shouldn't escape the pin. He was winning and if the vase hasn't broken he would have won. \n\nI get the people lie on here for karma or whatever, but this isn't a life-changing story or a dazzling feat. This is two people who were kidding around (possibly even flirting) and weren't paying attention to their surroundings. Has that never ever happened to you?", "Shes only fighting one of them, how you can claim its fake and not even understand what just read. How are you going to make a decision on the truth of something when you dont even get whats being said.", "For a second, I thought there might be actual good reasons to think the story is fake but it's just plain misogyny. Dang, really had me going for a sec.", "Eh you could whoop anyone of any size with the proper training", "She fought the brother who played football. She could take him. He does not know the technique for fighting and she does. Had it been the wrestler, I\u2019d agree.", "Of course she'd stand no chance if they were really trying to hurt her.  Cole was clearly playing around, though.  I think this pushed a button for you or something and you're not interpreting it clearly.", "People r mad bc u pointed out how obviously gullible they are lmao", "Also, if her martial arts teacher didn't warn her against trying to fight men, it would be a very bad teacher.", "Which only happened because much larger men with no expertise felt entitled to lecture someone who actually practices fighting about how she should fight, and when she didn\u2019t meekly nod along with their ignorance felt the need to enforce their opinions on her by insisting on physical violence.\n\nThis is a great lesson for the kid - she has now identified two men in her life as being exact examples of unsafe people.", "And to frame it like men just aren't capable of helping themselves is what a normal person would do.", "No it\u2019s not. Source: People who have spent their lives doing martial arts. None of the people I know who have martial arts as their hobby have ever done it for selfdefence reasons. They do it like other people might do running or yoga - because they enjoy it and for the exercise. You\u2019d have to be pretty committed to self-defense to take classes multiple times per week for a lifetime, if that was your main reason for doing it.", "Didn\u2019t say she did it to both of them. Either.", "He\u2019s been responding with condescending explanations of his expertise in *martial arts* and the superiority of big men fighting thin women. So close!", "Writing an essay to defend yourself for being gullible", "Or teenagers\u2026", "There are so many dudes on reddit who are for some reason weirdly invested in the fact that men are physically stronger than women, and get SO OFFENDED at the idea of any woman beating any man in a fight lol.", "I feel like you don't understand how weight classes work", "I have trained it for most of my life, would you like to debate me on this?", "I\u2019m aware of what she said, and nothing about my comment suggests I think she fought both of them at the same time.", "Huge myth. Not true at all.", "Why are you imagining details as if you were present in a made up story?", "Uh not necessarily. When I did martial arts in my early 20s the only students who were my size and skill level were two brothers who were 10 years older than I am. \n\nI took them down every time. \n\nI also took down my brother in law, who outweighs me by at least 175lbs, and also is martial arts trained, using a bokken. *Twice*.", "Weird take. Doing martial arts as a kid doesn't mean that you are able to fend off all attackers. Life isn't a Jet Li movie. \n\nI can say with utmost certainty, as someone who has trained for competitive fighting, and who has regrettably been in more than a few street scraps in their youth, running is the best course of action if something kicks off and your safety is on the line.\n\nNothing to do with size or gender when I say that. The life long injuries and brain damage that can occur from a five second mistake are no joke for anyone, nevermind the possibility of weapons being pulled or others jumping in.", "Did we read the same story. It sounds like she wanted to fight with him. If she is a martial artist she likely fights for the fun of it. Especially if she practice BJJ which is sounds like.", "No because if she honestly thought what she said shed be in big trouble. I dont care how strong you think you are, the playing field is not level and you need to realise this. Even as a guy ill flee before i try to fight.", ">None of the people I know who have martial arts as their hobby have ever done it for selfdefence reasons.\n\nHow lucky they are to NOT BEEN IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAD TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. Just because it might not have been the original main motivation it is certainly a thought.", "So when an MMA fighter gets into a fight outside the ring, they just forget everything they know about fighting? Get real. \ud83d\ude02", ">There is zero chance this \"willowy\", \"very delicate and fine-boned\" young lady could do anything against two boys over 6'3\" and 200 pounds (who used to wrestle and play football). ZERO CHANCE\n\nIt's right there in black and white, dude.", "Damn, missed it by one!", "Sure buddy, if that helps you feel smart.", "FACTS", "Or Boomers.", "Its so bizarre like. Why is it so important to be stronger than somebody you already decided is naturally weak?? \n\nMake it make sense", "Mixed martial arts has weight classes but when done individually its generally based on skill level so theres that", "So have both my little brothers (i did dance) and the 15yo girl i mentor and she regularly toss 200+ lb dudes across the dojo so idk maybe youre just not good at it", "Except for it doesn\u2019t say that she \u201ctook\u201d two large men. It says that during the fight, she was able to effectively dodge and wriggle out of his grip. Which is actually what some martial arts teach women to compensate for the physical strength difference. Why pretend to be an expert lmao", "Lol, its the first sentence of your second bullet point. Zero chance you reading comprehension. ZERO CHANCE.", "My brother is taller than me - 6ft3 to my 6ft. That\u2019s back when we were teens. I was \u201cwillowy\u201d at a size 10, I still managed to launch him across the living room and into a wall when he challenged me.", "Nobody said it did. A bunch of dipshits decided a kid who has *actually been training*, and therefore has been told \u201cstep one is don\u2019t be in a fight\u201d repeatedly, needed to be lectured by larger men on how she should be afraid and helpless all the time and nothing she does matters. She didn\u2019t cower sufficiently so one of them decided to try and enforce it physically, and from the description he got pretty embarassingly thrown around, proving her point rather than his. What are you trying to achieve here?", "You think she only trains with willowly 15 year old girls at her class my guy? In BJJ class there\u2019s  students of all sizes. Maybe shes confident because she is skilled. Lots of martial arts were created for smaller people to overcome larger bodies in combat. It is smarter to flee, but your mindset is what gets a lot of these large guy either knocked out or choked out by smaller trained opponents.", "And you need to understand that when your first instinct on hearing that a woman is learning self-defence is to try and physically overwhelm her to ensure she continues feeling properly unsafe at all times, you are part of the problem.\n\nIf you think martial arts and self defence classes don\u2019t teach that exact thing, *you are too ignorant on the subject to be in the conversation*. It\u2019s that simple. You are not sharing a helpful opinion, you\u2019re not enlightening the poor confused women to something they\u2019ve never heard before for their own good - you\u2019re just throwing your weight around because you can\u2019t tolerate hearing them be confident. Stop it.", "If an MMA fighter gets into a fight outside the ring the best thing to do is remove themselves immediately. Being a pro fighter means if anything bad happens you\u2019re extra f\u2019d because you should have known better.", "Right?? It\u2019s like me being really sanctimonious about how much better women are at breastfeeding than men lol", "i never claimed to be an expert, im just talking about things the way i personally know about them", "Until she has to find out the hard way irl and she is actually abused.\n\nAbusers need to be punished but lets not imagine they dont exist.\n\nYes we need to fight against burglars but hey. Ill still lock my front door to be safe.", "If someone attacks or strikes you, you have the right to defend yourself in most states. If you severely injure someone as a pro fighter you can be charged with assault/deadly weapon. My point still stands though. When a physical altercation finds you, you don't just forget what you learned because you're not in the dojo.", "Sorry not you the guy I replied to! I agree with you", "You do understand that you fantasising about a child being abused in order to make her learn to be afraid is as weird as those guys deciding to try and physically push her around because she dared consider herself something other than totally helpless?\n\nLearn to hear about a woman not being afraid all the time without instantly starting to try and force her to be afraid. It\u2019s weird."]}
