Nina is not short but she\u2019s willowy. She looks very delicate and fine-boned. Nina has been doing a couple forms of martial arts since she was 7 or 8.\n\nA couple days ago I took Nina with me to pick up a few things at my uncle\u2019s. My cousin Ted arrived early from another city so we stayed so I could catch up with them a bit. Everyone welcomed Nina and asked her how was her life in another city and her hobbies and whatnot.\n\nMy cousins Ted (22m) and Cole (17m) were openly staring when Nina told them she does martial arts. Ted used to wrestle in high school and Cole is on his school\u2019s varsity football team. They said it was great she took martial arts to defend herself but suggested a couple objects she could use against \u201creally big, strong guys\u201d she may be unable to handle.\n\nNina said sizes don\u2019t matter and she can protect herself against attackers of all kinds.\n\nAgain, Ted and Cole stared at her and asked if she seriously thought she could protect herself against someone their sizes. Ted was 6\u20194 and Cole was 6\u20193, both over 200 lbs.\n\nNina said yes.\n\nCole then asked Nina to go to the living room and told her to try to fend him off. We watched as Nina dodged Cole\u2019s grab until he managed to hold her ankle and brought her down. She tripped him in return and tried to shake him off while he tried to pull her to him. In the process they pulled the rug which upset a table, knocking it into another table and the vase on it fell to the floor, broken.\n\nMy aunt came downstairs and gave everyone involved a scolding, telling them the house was no place for a fight. She then said Cole and I owed her a new vase.\n\nI told her this was all on Cole who suggested they fight in the first place. Cole also said it was on him, but my aunt wouldn\u2019t have it. She said this was a teaching moment for Nina to own up to her mistakes. Nina offered to pay but I refused to let her.\n\nTed stepped in and said he got his mom a new vase for Christmas so this was perfect timing and there was no need to make this a big deal. Nina and I left and my boyfriend agreed we shouldn\u2019t have to pay. My aunt later called me and said I was being selfish and that the vase wasn\u2019t even that expensive but it was the principles of things that when you broke stuff, you need to take responsibilities.

Yet my understanding is that certain forms of martial arts wouldn\u2019t be ideal for a smaller person taking on a larger attacker, especially not those heavy on wrestling on the ground. It\u2019s also best for self-defence because usually attackers aren\u2019t expecting you to know how to fight and will potentially be intoxicated too, so you can much more easily knock them off their feet, escape from their grip (and potentially run if necessary), or potentially incapacitate them. If trained to take down larger attackers you\u2019re also usually weaponising their size and momentum against them, so you don\u2019t necessarily want to be the one on the offensive there.

And there are many martial art practitioners who severely overestimate the effectiveness of the martial art they practice, and/or their own ability to protect themselves. And this is not even related to gender. Anyone smaller and weaker will suffer more for having unfounded ignorance in their ability to protect themselves.", "Cole has accepted full responsibility and offered to pay for it. That should have been it. Anything afterwards was an attempt to \"teach a lesson\" in a way aunt deemed appropriate. In reality, kids have learned the lesson the minute they've caused the damage and the \"lesson\" they received from auntie is that she is an AH.", "I wasn't assuming Krav Maga at all.", "I simply said it as an extreme example.  Most martial arts (at least as it is taught in the US) doesn't have a string focus on self defense.  More so a focus on the forms.  Some focuses on sparring as well, but that varies.  My main point was just that someone who is versed in martial arts is in no way inherently well trained in self defense.", "I can tell you've never been in a fight \ud83d\ude02 you don't \"remove yourself\" when someone starts swinging. Ever heard of a sucker punch? They wait till you aren't paying attention then all of a sudden, your head is snapping back. Once someone swings or strikes you first, most of that shit goes out the window.", "NTA. You\u2019re the visitor not involved in the action.  Your SIL is only 15 and was responding to an invitation from Cole who lives there. He is the responsible party for the initiating action.", "The real lesson here is Nina should know that no martial arts maneuver will defend her against two giant men. Life is not a movie. Stay safe.", "NTA.", "Bottom line both the 17 & 15 are old enough to know better than wrestling in the house. They should pay for the vase if the home owner is asking for it. Both are wrong and it is disrespectful to the home owner. You are also being disrespectful to the home owner and not teaching the 15 to take responsibility when causing an accident", "\ud83d\ude06  NTA", "I", "ESH. Why didn't anyone stop this before the vase broke?", "Why did you just sit there and allow Cole and Ted to try to prove their masculinity in the living room? You knew it would be physical. You are YTA.  Your aunt was right. The living room is no place for a fight. Yet neither you or Ted (adults in the room) thought about your aunt's property. Your.aunt is right to be upset. Nina is NTA. She was the youngest one in the.room.", "NTA \n\nThis was coles idea, she does carry some responsibility but not nearly as much as your aunts trying to claim. Also funny how she demanded she pay but made zero comments about her son paying. If this was purely rational and principle based she\u2019d have demanded they both split the cost to replace it, and in that case id be defending her. She didn\u2019t though, she singled her out. Not entirely sure why, when again it wasn\u2019t her idea.\n\n I have to wonder though does your aunt not like your bf? does she have more money status than his side? does she feel some type of way about you being close enough to your boyfriends side to care for his sister and feels her side is being cheated? Is she enmeshed with her sons and picked up a tone of flirting? Is Nina particularly pretty? is she just generally entitled/narcissistic? Or is she the type that thinks her kids can do no wrong and it\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault? \n\nI feel like there has to be more to this for her to be specifically singling her out and only her. Especially in a case like this when her son took complete responsibility, admitted he started it, and that he\u2019d pay to replace it. Either way she\u2019s being entirely unreasonable here. Not for wanting it replaced.. but for again, singling only her out while absolving her son of responsibility and going out of her way to harass you after the fact. I\u2019d put some distance between you two and just wouldn\u2019t talk to her for awhile.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not saying forever (unless she\u2019s really that toxic, there\u2019s more we don\u2019t know, or she doubles down and continues to harass you) just long enough that she understands she\u2019s not getting her way and she doesn\u2019t get to harass you and Nina and get away with it.", "Judgement was already rendered on this one before I saw it. But I just wanted to say that my daughter faced the same problem. As soon as a boy heard she studied martial arts, they wanted to challenge her. I don\u2019t know what it is about a girl learning martial arts that makes it a challenge to guys. In most situations, she\u2019s had to use martial arts to flip someone on their back, throw them, or just plain kick/knee them in the balls to protect herself from them. At least your bf\u2019s sister knew it was coming. My daughter usually didn\u2019t get a warning. \n\nNTA by the way.", "I do feel bad\u2026.for you. Her part in it is on her, not the entire incident. OP never said anything about the aunt or uncle (the homeowners) saying it was \u201cfine to fo stupid shit\u201d in the house. Quit making up shit so you can feel a certain way about it. You\u2019re a reason why people in this country are how they are\u2026.no one\u2019s ever wrong or accountable for their actions.", "That's actually a very real issue with women and martial arts. *If* she's been training in a setting where she's not really being exposed to how strong or dangerous men can really be, she can have an exaggerated sense of strength and end up in danger. There are/were plenty of women and teenage girls that were extremely skilled in my dojo, but sheer brute force is going to get the best of most women, period. And I say this as a woman, just fyi.", "As a woman who lives in this world, it is how we are require to think to keep ourselves safe. Do I think every single man will attack me? Of course not, that's stupid. It's not all men, but it's some (very few) of them. And there is no way to tell them apart from good people at a glance.", "If you only knew", "Yeah, the one who instigated the incident should pay, not the victim\n\nI'm surprised the males didn't ask her to name three MMA fighters - but no, not the popular ones - no, three obscure ones - no, not those three - huh, who are they?", "Hopefully they also won't assume girl = weak", "So annoying that male superiority is framed as flirting.\n\nNo, he doesn't like you, and if he does, if he is cruel to girls he likes, then get far, far away.", "\"Girls and women accurately knowing their own strength and skills is worse than creepy men belittling them\"\n\nNo.", "Or she could simply acknowledge that while martial arts training is helpful, she's not invulnerable.", "Not reminding someone of the fact that most men can beat them up is not the same as actively encouraging someone to think they can defend themselves against someone twice their size. Which is what happened here... Everyone kinda acted like children (half of them were).", "She wouldn\u2019t need to have this conversation if those two boys didn\u2019t have ego problems", "Exactly this.
