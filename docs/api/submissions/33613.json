Nina is not short but she\u2019s willowy. She looks very delicate and fine-boned. Nina has been doing a couple forms of martial arts since she was 7 or 8.\n\nA couple days ago I took Nina with me to pick up a few things at my uncle\u2019s. My cousin Ted arrived early from another city so we stayed so I could catch up with them a bit. Everyone welcomed Nina and asked her how was her life in another city and her hobbies and whatnot.\n\nMy cousins Ted (22m) and Cole (17m) were openly staring when Nina told them she does martial arts. Ted used to wrestle in high school and Cole is on his school\u2019s varsity football team. They said it was great she took martial arts to defend herself but suggested a couple objects she could use against \u201creally big, strong guys\u201d she may be unable to handle.\n\nNina said sizes don\u2019t matter and she can protect herself against attackers of all kinds.\n\nAgain, Ted and Cole stared at her and asked if she seriously thought she could protect herself against someone their sizes. Ted was 6\u20194 and Cole was 6\u20193, both over 200 lbs.\n\nNina said yes.\n\nCole then asked Nina to go to the living room and told her to try to fend him off. We watched as Nina dodged Cole\u2019s grab until he managed to hold her ankle and brought her down. She tripped him in return and tried to shake him off while he tried to pull her to him. In the process they pulled the rug which upset a table, knocking it into another table and the vase on it fell to the floor, broken.\n\nMy aunt came downstairs and gave everyone involved a scolding, telling them the house was no place for a fight. She then said Cole and I owed her a new vase.\n\nI told her this was all on Cole who suggested they fight in the first place. Cole also said it was on him, but my aunt wouldn\u2019t have it. She said this was a teaching moment for Nina to own up to her mistakes. Nina offered to pay but I refused to let her.\n\nTed stepped in and said he got his mom a new vase for Christmas so this was perfect timing and there was no need to make this a big deal. Nina and I left and my boyfriend agreed we shouldn\u2019t have to pay. My aunt later called me and said I was being selfish and that the vase wasn\u2019t even that expensive but it was the principles of things that when you broke stuff, you need to take responsibilities.

Yet my understanding is that certain forms of martial arts wouldn\u2019t be ideal for a smaller person taking on a larger attacker, especially not those heavy on wrestling on the ground. It\u2019s also best for self-defence because usually attackers aren\u2019t expecting you to know how to fight and will potentially be intoxicated too, so you can much more easily knock them off their feet, escape from their grip (and potentially run if necessary), or potentially incapacitate them. If trained to take down larger attackers you\u2019re also usually weaponising their size and momentum against them, so you don\u2019t necessarily want to be the one on the offensive there. In an actual fight where you needed the self-defence training the goal is often to get away rather than to engage further and prove how tough you are. \n\nSo even if she\u2019s capable of defending herself against someone their size it\u2019s dumb to challenge people to a fight, especially in the house where you\u2019re breaking stuff.", "[removed]", "And one got shamed and have to pay for the broken Vase.", "So why wouldn't you pay 'her share' then?

From the outside, it\u2019s pretty clear the older boy was interested in the younger girl. So she should have, as a guest, told her host \u201cno\u201d, that he was making an irresponsible suggestion. That\u2019s unfair onus. It\u2019s his house. She shouldn\u2019t have to assume she knows better than him what is and isn\u2019t allowed. In fact, it\u2019d be arrogant to assume to know the house rules better than someone who lives there, as a guest.

I\u2019m talking about self-defence though. I\u2019m not sticking around if I can help it, risking a larger attacker getting the upper hand in the scenario. I\u2019d not be treating it like sparring, where there\u2019s rules in place and the expectation for both parties to continue to engage. I\u2019m also not going around picking fights with anyone, especially not people significantly larger than me. The kind of people likely to pick a fight with a significantly smaller person randomly also probably aren\u2019t expecting any training, probably are intoxicated, probably feel recklessly confident, and honestly probably don\u2019t have fighting training and probably aren\u2019t likely to even be athletes. If you manage to knock them off their feet if they grab at you acting aggressive that could be enough to jar them temporarily and give you time to get away. If you manage to do that and stick around for some reason then the odds obviously get worse. My karate training had a lot of focus on keeping balance, maintaining a good safe distance, and being mobile. It was often said while learning moves or ways of responding to different attacks or grabs that it was to give you the chance to get away. \n\nIf they go from 0-100 and start punching unexpectedly, which seems unlikely to be the scenario based on my experience, then yeah you\u2019re likely screwed. \n\nIn general it\u2019s best to just avoid fighting, deescalate if possible, and run if it seems like fighting is the alternative. \n\nMartial arts usually also teaches you how to fall and protect the most vulnerable parts of your body, so hopefully if you\u2019re hit and overwhelmed you can still minimise the damage done and maybe still get away. Maybe give enough time for someone else to step in to help. It really depends on the specifics obviously. \n\nGoing on the offensive against a significantly larger attacker for no reason is just dumb though imo.", "It still doesn't equate an 80pbs difference. This guy is correct. Nina's only really shot is to just run away. 80lbs is nothing to be triffled with. Unless she has a weapon, she's going to lose.

The weight/size difference there is the key of why women in general have yo be careful fighting. Most of the time we are outsized by opponents. So we have to find different ways to fight and survive.

But hopefully she takes the guys up on learning how to use the \"weapons\" offered to protect herself too.", "So, nothing broke because we were outside, but a childhood friend of mine moved back when we were teens... 100% flirting the entire time because his glow up was huge, and so was mine. We weren't those awkward little kids anymore that was bored and only had each other to play with. He was tall and muscular and played football. I was huge into makeup and cared about my appearance, but still insecure. The giggling was obvious, and hormones clearly now in the mix versus when we were kids. I had no regrets as he swooped me off my feet and carried me fireman style, and my brothers laughed at me for even trying.
