And when stepmom is shown a mirror of how hateful she has been to your wife, stepmom immediately pulls the emotional blackmail card with the crying. And you fell for it. Your wife needs a partner who isn't enabling stepmom's hateful behavior, but you are doing that every step of the way. Where was your lukewarm \"I felt kinda bad\" chivalry when your wife was being bullied by stepmom?", "YTA. Step mom finally got a taste of her own medicine and you ruined it.", "ESH\n\nInstead of whatever you just did that made your step mom cry, you should have an adult conversation with her about her rude behavior and how you won't tolerate anymore insults to your wife. Next time she insults your wife, leave.", "YTA, not for ratting her out , but for not standing up for your wife. It must suck for her to deal with all the comments when the person who could (And should) help doesn\u2019t", "ESH. Step mom's behavior sucks, but the way you deal with it is to communicate and set boundaries. Y'all just made more conflict for yourselves. What happened after this?", "YTA\n\nYou let your family bully your wife, and the one time your wife fights back, you start to feel sorry for your stepmom. Did you ever confront your family about their treatment of your wife? If I was your wife I'd simply refuse to visit your family from now on. \n\nAnd due to your folding down to your stepmom's manipulative tears, your family has escalated their bullying of your wife. And now you do nothing again.", "ESH.  Your stepmom needed to be stood up to, but you didn't handle it well either. You didn't think it through.\n\n>My stepmom specifically doesn't like the fact that my wife refused to take my name upon marriage and continues to work\n\nYour stepmom does not get a decision-making say in your household. She thinks she does, and that's the problem you tried to address.\n\nNormal social convention is quite clear that these are your wife's decisions, that as her husband you should be ok with, but the in-laws have no say. Your stepmom was breaking the social rules before anything else happened.\n\nThere was a germ of a good idea in there. Holding a mirror to her actions is not a terrible thing to illustrate the point, but it needs to be short and sharp. Telling her that you were *messing with her* was the insult. You weren't messing with her. You should have told her that her overstepping comments weren't welcome, and you wanted to her to see it for herself. That gives you room to say it didn't come out the way you wanted, she can do the same, and perhaps there's some growth.\n\nBut by saying you were messing with her, you didn't get the point across, and you just portrayed yourself and your wife as purely being mean.", "YTA - for falling for the tears\n\nINFO: why did you stop the prank? Does she ever stop when asked? Does she accept others discomfort as a sign to stop?\n\nShe\u2019s spends her time judging (not very Christian) and bullying your wife, and you\u2019re just now addressing it. She is a grown adult, not a delicate flower. **And since she\u2019s happy to dish it out, she better be able to take it.**\n\nYou, however, it seems need to work on a shiny spine and putting a stop to her behavior or make it clear that y\u2019all won\u2019t be around. The relationship she has is a privilege, and if she cannot be a decent human being then let her make snide comments to herself. Alone.", "ESH, why weren't boundaries set to begin with, which is the adult thing to do? Your stepmother's opinions were unwanted, and so you should have told her so. Was this communicated to your parents? It was childish of your wife to make this suggestion, and childish of you to comply. The only way to fix this is to sit down with your parents and talk like adults.", "ESH. Meeting bad behavior with more bad behavior is never the way to go in my experience. What needed to happen was for there just to be a firm conversation with stepmom saying: She\u2019s not taking my name, she\u2019s going to work, etc. and that\u2019s the end of it. You have your own lives now and she either accepts it or you\u2019ll have to reconsider the relationship with her, such as possibly going no contact. Period. And then if she couldn\u2019t keep her mouth shut, follow through on your parameters. As far as you wife right now, tell her you\u2019re sorry you deviated from the plan, but after reconsidering, it was cruel and the wrong way to go and that you both should rethink your strategy.", "NTA\n\nYou're taking your wife's side like you should, I'm surprised you didn't stand up to her earlier and let this thing escalate. So you're not the AH for defending your wife but you're the AH for not standing up to her form the very beginning.", "YTA. Man up and stand up for your wife, for God's sake.", "ESH, you all need to grow tf up.", "EDIT: After reading a response from OP that stepmom\u2019s comments are not just a little old fashioned, but outright sexist and offensive. It\u2019s a soft YTA because yeah we shouldn\u2019t make people cry, but it sounds like she\u2019s made your wife feel that way on several occasions and karma was just paying her an early visit via your wife. Is it the most altruistic course of action? Of course not. Was it deserved? Oh yes.\n\nNTA, your wife and you were being a bit petty and decided to show your stepmom the ridiculousness of her behavior. Nothing wrong with a little giving someone a taste of their own medicine. However, you noticed the prank had gone too far with your stepmom in tears and did the right thing to end the prank, so to speak. Your wife needs to learn that petty and mean-spirited behavior (whether deserved or not) always runs the risk of making you look bad/ just as mean to others.", "NTA. The whole point was to impress upon your stepmother how corrosive her remarks and attitude are to your wife. Now, your stepmother understands you are unequivocally in your wife\u2019s corner and if she insults one, she has to answer to both. Your wife should be happy.", "YTA 1 for letting your dad and step mum treat your wife this way. 2 for going ahead with the stupid childish plan in the first place. \n\nBe grown ups tell your step mum how you feel and if she doesnt accept you and your wifes choices then you will limit contact. You wife should not be stressed just to visit your family", "YTA\n\nWhy haven't you made clear to your stepmom what her place is when she made her first comment months ago? And why are you still visiting your parents when stepmom can't respect your boundaries?\n\nTo me, this sounds like you care more about your stepmom than your own wife. A few crocodile tears from your stepmom are more important to you than your wife being harrassed for months now. \n\nWondering how long your wife will keep up with this. Good thing is, she doesn't have to change her name back when she divorces you, lol.", "YTA\n\nGrow a back bone and tell your step mother to shut up instead of playing this weird game and then caving when she pulls out crocodile tears.\n\nStand up for your wife.", "You do realise you're not helpless, you're not a child and you can tell your family where to shove it don't you? Why are you coming up with silly games to mess with your stepmother instead of flat-out telling her that she will keep her snide comments to herself, or she won't be seeing you or your wife?\n\n\nYou gave in because your stepmonster was reduced to tears. Is that what your wife needs to do to get your support - cry? Or is it only stepmother who can manipulate you like that? YTA. You need to grow up and meet your family as an adult protecting his own new family. I can't believe you've allowed it to go this far frankly.", "ESH. You played of game of escalation until you all lost. You won nothing by winning. \n\nYour stepmom would be better served with a sincere conversation and confrontation regarding her behaviour and words.", "ESH.\n\nThis is childish and you should have had a frank conversation about boundaries instead, much sooner than this. \u201cWe have made these decisions as a team and they are not up for debate, you will not talk to my wife like that. If you do, we will leave.\u201d And then do.\n\nInstead of defending your wife, you threw her under the bus for her aggressor\u2019s comfort.", "ESH", "NTA \ud83d\ude02.
