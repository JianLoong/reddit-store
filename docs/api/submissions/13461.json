And when stepmom is shown a mirror of how hateful she has been to your wife, stepmom immediately pulls the emotional blackmail card with the crying. And you fell for it. Your wife needs a partner who isn't enabling stepmom's hateful behavior, but you are doing that every step of the way. Where was your lukewarm \"I felt kinda bad\" chivalry when your wife was being bullied by stepmom?", "YTA. Step mom finally got a taste of her own medicine and you ruined it.", "ESH\n\nInstead of whatever you just did that made your step mom cry, you should have an adult conversation with her about her rude behavior and how you won't tolerate anymore insults to your wife.

Did you ever confront your family about their treatment of your wife?

You didn't think it through.\n\n>My stepmom specifically doesn't like the fact that my wife refused to take my name upon marriage and continues to work\n\nYour stepmom does not get a decision-making say in your household. She thinks she does, and that's the problem you tried to address.\n\nNormal social convention is quite clear that these are your wife's decisions, that as her husband you should be ok with, but the in-laws have no say. Your stepmom was breaking the social rules before anything else happened.\n\nThere was a germ of a good idea in there. Holding a mirror to her actions is not a terrible thing to illustrate the point, but it needs to be short and sharp. Telling her that you were *messing with her* was the insult. You weren't messing with her. You should have told her that her overstepping comments weren't welcome, and you wanted to her to see it for herself. That gives you room to say it didn't come out the way you wanted, she can do the same, and perhaps there's some growth.\n\nBut by saying you were messing with her, you didn't get the point across, and you just portrayed yourself and your wife as purely being mean.", "YTA - for falling for the tears\n\nINFO: why did you stop the prank?

She is a grown adult, not a delicate flower. **And since she\u2019s happy to dish it out, she better be able to take it.**\n\nYou, however, it seems need to work on a shiny spine and putting a stop to her behavior or make it clear that y\u2019all won\u2019t be around. The relationship she has is a privilege, and if she cannot be a decent human being then let her make snide comments to herself. Alone.", "ESH, why weren't boundaries set to begin with, which is the adult thing to do? Your stepmother's opinions were unwanted, and so you should have told her so. Was this communicated to your parents? It was childish of your wife to make this suggestion, and childish of you to comply. The only way to fix this is to sit down with your parents and talk like adults.", "ESH. Meeting bad behavior with more bad behavior is never the way to go in my experience. What needed to happen was for there just to be a firm conversation with stepmom saying: She\u2019s not taking my name, she\u2019s going to work, etc. and that\u2019s the end of it. You have your own lives now and she either accepts it or you\u2019ll have to reconsider the relationship with her, such as possibly going no contact. Period.

Is it the most altruistic course of action? Of course not. Was it deserved? Oh yes.\n\nNTA, your wife and you were being a bit petty and decided to show your stepmom the ridiculousness of her behavior. Nothing wrong with a little giving someone a taste of their own medicine. However, you noticed the prank had gone too far with your stepmom in tears and did the right thing to end the prank, so to speak. Your wife needs to learn that petty and mean-spirited behavior (whether deserved or not) always runs the risk of making you look bad/ just as mean to others.", "NTA.

Why are you coming up with silly games to mess with your stepmother instead of flat-out telling her that she will keep her snide comments to herself, or she won't be seeing you or your wife?\n\n\nYou gave in because your stepmonster was reduced to tears. Is that what your wife needs to do to get your support - cry? Or is it only stepmother who can manipulate you like that? YTA.
