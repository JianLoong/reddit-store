We all disliked her for valid reasons but for the sake of peace, we pretended to like her to support him. They've been married for at least two years and today I got a call from him telling me he was considering divorcing Emily because of \"issues\". I wasn't at all surprised, took him long enough, or so I thought.\n\nHe asked me for advice and I was hesitant since I knew nothing about marriage but when he asked for my honest opinion about her, I was only too glad to finally tell him that I, including everyone else, found her completely obnoxious, rude and self absorbed. I had first hand experience in this because I went to school with her. She was/is a bully, constantly puts anyone down just to feel better about herself and always trying to one up others. Honestly if I had a penny for everytime she did something witchy, my name would be Jeff Bezos. \n\nAnyways, I told him that I thought him marrying her was a huge mistake. To my surprise, Emily got on the phone and started going off at me, calling me names. I was confused about this whole thing and they told me it was some sort of test to get our real feelings towards Emily because she was suspicious that we were talking shit about her behind her back.\n\nAnd she was spot on. We were talking shit about her. I wanted to apologize for talking behind her back but after all the name calling, I realized I didn't have to pretend to like her anymore so I told her almost nobody likes her in the family and that she was a spoilt wretch who was never taught how to treat others. At the end of the heated call, I told my brother to do us all a favour and divorce her. \n\nI also told my sisters and the rest of the family that we didn't have to pretend around that self centered arrogant prick anymore so now she's manipulated our brother to make us look like we're ganging up on her, all in a day's work. The devil works hard but she definitely works harder.\n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1699652654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17senpz/aita_for_giving_my_solicited_opinion_about_my/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Should have been first clue that something was fishy, why wouldn't you ask HIM what happened...", "NTA he brought it on himself. The best part is not having to pretend anymore.", "NTA. If they wanted honest answers, they got them. If they didn't want the truth if it was that you didn't like her, they shouldn't have asked. They literally walked themselves into that situation. Good on you for being honest. You keep doing you and your brother can deal with his wife on his own. :)", "Wow he's 29 and shes 27?

He set you up because she suspected you didn't like her, you said that you don't, and the rest of your family doesn't, and that makes you bad? Nah. She is a spoilt wretch and if he wants to isolate himself with her, he'll just have to go ahead and do that.", "Mixed\n\nNTA: He asked, you answered. \n\n(Though you could have been more tactful -- you smacked as hard as you could. It was overkill and immature.)\n\n\nAHs: Brother and his wife are BOTH AHs with underhanded behavior. And don't blame his wife alone like your brother is innocent either --  your brother owed you more loyalty than his wife. He let you down horribly and completely.\n\nWhere you're YTA: Stick with how YOU feel. It was up to your family what each wanted to divulge.They told you in confidence. \n\nAnd BTW: Never, ever trust your brother again. He betrayed you SO badly.", "NTA.

If my options were between a burning dumpster, and a minute with Emily, I\u2019d jump right in and pay the raccoons rent money. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t like her, you and the family did the right thing by keeping quiet these years.

You for pretending to like her, before you were asked. It doesn't pay to be dishonest about these things. I am not suggesting that you should have abused her to her face from her wedding day onward, but you could just have said nothing and remained neutral. Then you brother sucks for putting you through the test, your SIL for the same reason and possibly also for being a witch. I don't know her, so I couldn't say. Word to live by: Never talk shit about the other part in a divorce situation, till you know it is actually happening, if even then. The amount of people who will suddenly discover new-found love for each other 5 minutes after your having said your honest (non-flattering) opinion about the other party is staggering.", "Wow...now that's how you go scorched earth.  I guess it will be a peaceful holiday season as you won't be seeing brother and 'wretch' this season.", "Ugh... ESH.\n\nYou should simply have said 'my opinion of her doesn't matter, you'e the one who married her'.  And you definitely shouldn't have said \"...including everyone else...\".\n\nBut... oh, well. You lost the high road when Emily realized y'all were talking about her behind her back.\n\nETA: You were asked specifically and under those circumstances you could have said (for example) 'she has a short temper, like last week when she yelled at the kid next door and she's always complaining about having no money but you always complain that she comes home from shopping with lots of junk...' When you bring up concrete examples of behavior to reinforce your opinions, people take your opinions a lot more seriously.", "N A H / E S H\n\nHe literally asked you for your honest opinion and you gave it to him. It's a very negative opinion but you might be right and you did stay cordial and keep it to yourself around them, until directly asked. \n\nTheir tactics was underhanded but it sounds like they had reasons to suspect you hated her guts and talked shit behind her back. They were right about that. It's kinda shitty but so is feeling that everyone is secretly hostile to you and just waiting until you exit the room to talk trash behind your back and not knowing whether it's real or it's in your head. \n\nBasically: they wanted to know. Now they do. It is what it is. Unfortunately, you likely lost your brother, at least for the time being. \n\nETA: INFO: was is the first time he or she asked how you felt about her? Did they ever try to address that she felt you disliked her before?", "ESH\n\nYour opinion should have been restricted to your thoughts alone you aren\u2019t your family\u2019s mouthpiece.\n\nYour bro and Emily for setting up a tap like that, obviously.", "ESH - He asked for your opinion and you gave it, however if you knew all of this you should've looked out for your brother and told him sooner", "ESH - You for talking bad about your SIL behind her back. Your brother for setting the little trap.\n\nI'm puzzled by the dynamic of trapping you into making an admission, either they believe the people who say you've been talking behind her back, or they don't. This \"test\" was of those people's honesty as much as it was of yours. It seems that they trust neither their friends (who told them that you were spreading venom) nor do they trust their family. The way they act (and you as well) makes me wonder why you all surround yourselves with people who need to be tested.", "I mean, kinda YTA. Especially for getting into it on the phone and digging in deeper. The real question is this is who was the bigger AH. And IMO it's your brother.\n\nBut that was a REAAAALLLLLLY stupid thing for your brother to do. He totally set you up for it. And now he's going to have one helluva time integrating whatever family him and SIL may have with his side of the family.\n\nAs I started reading your post I thought, \"Oof, I hope she doesn't unload in case they get back together and he forever knows you hate his wife.\"", "Instead of supporting your brother during his confession, you blew your shit wide open. When you marry someone, you marry their family as well. I'm sure he has known for some time about your feelings towards his wife. And it hurts... It hurts her too. I would have never told my brother those awful things, even if he did divorce her.\nSomething's are better left unsaid. I hope your family can heal in time... Find something, anything you like about your SIL and focus on that. They will have children someday together.\nBe a family. Be the sister your brother hopes you are.", "ESH. It\u2019s fine to answer your brothers question and I think it was a pretty big self own for them,  but they got their answer. Calling her a wretch? Lame. \n\nAlso it\u2019s generally best not to opine on what other people think of something. If you want to tell her you hate her, fine I guess. But don\u2019t speak on behalf of others no matter how confident you are as a messenger. They may not want their opinions known.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
