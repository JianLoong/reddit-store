I said no off the bat because I just found it an odd request tbh, our flat is two rooms and a bathroom so our bedroom would be off limits to everyone.

AITA?\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone for interacting and giving advice! Unfortunately our doors don\u2019t have locks on and because we rent it would be unlikely for us to fit locks ourselves.

That includes a bed in a guest room, a blow up bed, a camping bed, sofa bed, sofa, or the floor. (Or a tent in the garden.) The alternative if those are not suitable, is to go to a hotel or someone else's home. It does not include the host giving up their own bed and room. Your dad is being manipulative.

I\u2019ve given my bed up for my in-laws before, but it was something we discussed and all agreed upon beforehand.

When we got our room, it was a single bed. No problem - we just topped and tailed. However, we were given a single blanket and  one pillow.  The next day, I asked for another cover (which I got and a pillow - which was refused.  I've never forgotten that.  \n\n\nThe partner told me that he'd suggested giving up their bed to us. Quite rightly, the daughter had refused. (The baby was only 2 and a half  months old then.) However,  I still can't get over the fact that we were invited and couldn't even get a pillow each.

It is a somewhat weird request (especially if there are no medical factors to her needing a bed vs pullout) but doubly so bc of what the event is. Like if you don't want to stay up late and party to some extent why even go to a nye party? Just decline the invite with a \"I don't care about nye and don't want to stay up all night. Don't want to interfere with other celebrating and since there is no space I have to respectfully decline the invite\" \n\nI ditto other people's comments. If they do come, get a lock for your door so it can't \"accidently\" happen and you're stuck.\n\nThe only other thing I could think of is, if there is a space that's away from the party get a decent air mattress and they can sleep there instead of the sofa.", "NTA.

I had a renters situation where my bedroom doorknob didn\u2019t have a locking mechanism and I just bought a keyed doorknob for $30 and installed it in 10 minutes. When I moved out I just swapped it back, just as fast. A lot of doorknobs aren\u2019t actually permanently attached to the door but are threaded through a hole and held tight to to the door through the tension of two screws that attach the doorknobs on either side.", "I'd really like to know how people come up with these amazing comebacks. Teach me your ways", "Definitely need it locked. And I will gladly be the asshole if she were to break into my bedroom to sleep, I will drag her out by the hair to get her out of there.", "Oh yeah we have a spare double duvet and many pillows and blankets they\u2019d be able to have", "Unfortunately our apartment is very small so there isn\u2019t space for a mattress apart from in the living room where the party will be happening. To clarify there are no medical reasons for the request (but obviously if she did have any or feel unwell I\u2019d feel differently about the whole thing)", "> Your dad is telling you that he is not feeling comfortable with the arrangements you made for your guests (aka him and his gf).\n\nThen he can stay somewhere else. Demanding OP's bed instead of the sofa bed is unreasonable."]}
