The title sounds cold, but I am sincerely not sure what the right thing to do is in this case. I (17f) live with my mom (53f) and sister. Sister isn't really relevant.\n\nMy mom pays for a woman \"Adi\" (50f) to come clean the house once a month. She has been coming for about 5 months now. I do not see her often but always say hi when I do (probably 3 times max). We do not have a close relationship. \n\nI have an okay relationship with my mom. We are not close on a personal level because I grew up with her berating me on the phone to anyone that would listen. She would just always say I'm being bad all the time. I was raised watching the TV and never had that tender love you see on it. I only got tough love and basically she always took it personal and defensive if I ever cried. (This is ever since I could remember. Like 4 years old) If I ever cried for any reason I'd be told to shut up and stop being dramatic).\n\nI do love my mom, but a result of how she raised me is that I NEVER tell her anything about my personal life. I don't feel that it would stay with between us so I just don't confide in her for anything. I very much hate when she blabs to random people about my personal life.\n\nOnto the issue: Adi lost her son. My mom came to me spilling all the details of his death and the fact that Adi was going to take time off from work. \n\nToday, Adi came over. When I saw her I greeted her with my usual Hi, which she reciprocated in a friendly manner and continued on working. \n\nLater on, my mom asked me if I said anything to her about her son. I looked at her and told her that I said hi to her and did not mention her son. My reasoning being that Adi herself never disclosed that information to me. I felt I would be very disrespectful to bring it up especially while she is working and we do not have a close relationship. \n\nMy mom said I NEED to say something and that its rude not to. I stood firm that it's rude to bring it up.\n\nIf it were me, I sure as hell would not want people coming up to me at work about something extremely personal as it would cause me to cry and give me a lot of grief while I'm just trying to get through my day.\n\nNow, taking my relationship with my mom into consideration, I understand that I may have a very warped and wrong viewpoint about these things. So I could definitely use some insight and point of views that aren't my own (Unfortunely I do not trust my mom's judgement).\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts.", "created_utc": 1698379219, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hf07x/aita_for_not_offering_my_condolences_to_the_woman/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm going throw age in here but as a 17 y/o its not really your place. If you never had a close relationship to begin with I don't see the issue. Now if anything, at most I would say, \"Hey, my mom told me about your son and I'm sorry to hear about his passing\" and leave it at that. So if she's upset that you know about it, at least you can pass the blame off on to your mom? lol.", "NTA. In a situation like this, you should follow the other person's lead. Some people like to wear their heart on their sleeves and feel better after talking about their heartaches. Others would prefer not to discuss something so personal with a near stranger and might even be grateful for a distraction (such as work) when they can perhaps put it out of their mind for a short time. Neither approach is wrong. \n\nIf Adi seemed business-as-usual, I don't think you were wrong for assuming she didn't want to talk about it. If you saw her looking distraught, on the other hand, it would be kind to go up to her and say something sympathetic, then follow her lead from there. It can be hard but do your best to read the room and care for the person in the way they prefer, to the best of your ability. Which is what you did.", "NTA\n\nI cleaned houses many many years ago & I would not have expected a client\u2019s teenager to offer me condolences if I had lost someone", "NTA, you were doing a kind thing for not bringing up a heartbreaking thing in this woman\u2019s life out of the blue. The right moment would be when she mentions it, in my opinion.", "NTA you are right in that you\u2019ve only met her 3 times. Since she told your mom all the details it\u2019s appropriate for your mom to offer condolences. Your approach was fine. Ignore your mom.", "Hmmm you could be the asshole but I also see where you're coming from. In general it's polite to acknowledge someone's loss BUT if you didn't know she had a son etc I get it. \nAlso as someone who's lost a parent the last thing I wanted was people coming up to me and trying to talk to me about it. If they did it was an instant breakdown and I'm sure her emotions are very raw regarding the loss of her son. \nI wouldn't worry much about it. If you had more contact with her then yes you probably should have said something. NTA IMO", "NTA\n\nReading it, I was first leaning towards Y T A, but your reasoning is very sound. \n\nIf I revealed something so horrific to my employer and they treated it like office gossip (as your mom did), I\u2019d be pissed as hell. It\u2019s terrible behavior.\n\nGood job. You are a very wise and intuitive 17yo. Impressive.", "You, being the son of a less than stellar mother, and Adi being a grieving mother, I think you have a great opportunity at a lifelong friendship on a level you would never dream. You can tell Adi that don\u2019t you don\u2019t to be insensitive, but your mom told you about her son and just tell her how absolutely sorry you are. Then if she wants to talk about it, she will. If not, you did what was right.", "You are not the asshole at all but if YOU WANT you could offer condolences. I wouldn't if I were you bc I agree with your point that whyyy would you bring it up the poor woman is just trying to work not be reminded of her loss.", "NTA. Based on your relationship I doubt she is offended or hurt you didn\u2019t say anything. That being said, telling her next time you see her that your mom told you of the passing of her son, and you are sorry for her loss, is a thoughtful thing to do. If she is going to continue working for your mom even though you have not had a lot of interactions with her now, that doesn\u2019t me you will not in the future. It is a good thing when people who work in your home have a good opinion of you. This simple gesture will\nshow her you are a kind person.", "I lost my son about 5 1/2 years back.  I obviously told my employers because they needed to know, but I went into work between his death and the funeral.  One of my coworkers noticed my personality difference and asked what was wrong.  I told her I didn't want to discuss it... so she went to the bosses to find out and then came back to pass along her condolences.  \n\nIt pissed me off.  I do not want condolences from a bunch of people who barely know me and don't know my son.  There is a reason why I didn't tell her and told her I didn't want to discuss it.  \n\nOthers, though, want the condolences.  The right answer is never one size fits all.  You are not the asshole.  When in doubt, take the cue from the grieving person.", "NAH. She wouldn't expect you to say anything because she doesn't even know whether you're aware. Since you are aware, though, it would be kind to tell her that you heard about her son and are sorry for her loss. Keep it brief, and let her respond and then get on with her work. I'm sure she would be touched, even if she does tear up a little (that's not a bad thing!).\n\nIt's more important, however, that your mom recognize her loss since she works for your mom and there was already a direct communication about it.", " NAH it costs you nothing to be kind. Adi may not have told you herself but you know she lost her son. A few kind words would go a long way. I\u2019m sure she is struggling to show up to work each day. Your words may be a small comfort.", "NTA with a but\n\nWhile I understand your point of view and your mom is wrong to say you \u201cneed\u201d to say something\u2026\n\nIt would be an extremely kind gesture for you to acknowledge Adi\u2019s loss.  You don\u2019t have to say anything - but a simple sympathy card might be nice.  Even for someone you don\u2019t know well.", "YTA. None of your explanations about your relationship with your mother are relevant to you not having the common courtesy to extend condolences to the woman who cleans up behind you and your family.  This isn\u2019t about how you think you\u2019d feel in her place, the fact is her son died and her client\u2019s daughter couldn\u2019t be bothered to acknowledge her monumental loss. You didn\u2019t care about her feelings, this was about *your* awkwardness and immaturity. \n\nBut in time you\u2019ll probably think back to this and hopefully realize it was the beginning of your life lessons on practicing empathy and compassion when it doesn\u2019t seem to benefit you - because making the effort to connect face to face instead of behind a screen does take courage. I wish you the courage to step out behind the screen and learn how to connect to RL people of all ages and backgrounds in all social situations.", "NAH. I mean I get not wanting to be personal but showing small acts of kindness can really make someones day", "You don't have to if you don't feel comfortable saying anything. It's a nice gesture, showing empathy, but you're not obligated to do so.", "I\u2019m on the fence with judgement but for this specific scenario I think NAH. This is one of those things that you have to go with your gut, if you feel you don\u2019t know Adi well enough to give condolences that\u2019s fine. It may be awkward and I see your perspective on not wanting to bring it up. But on the flip side people can feel hurt that the topic goes unmentioned. It would in any normal scenario be totally devastating to lose your child and to think that the topic wasn\u2019t important for others to even acknowledge would really hurt.", "NAH but you should have said something, and now that it's been brought to your attention, you should say something. Losing a son is too big not to acknowledge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

But it isn't oversharing for you mom to tell you that Adi's son died (though perhaps she overshared in regards to the details). \n\nSince your approach doesn't appear to bother Adi, I'm going to say NAH.

Since you weren't told directly by Adi, you'd say \"My mother told me about your son. I'm so sorry for your loss,\" and then move on. You don't need to really dwell on it. And as you're young, I'll give you some more advice for the next time you are confronted with a grieving friend or acquaintance - *absolutely* use neutral, standard phrasing - \"I'm sorry for your loss\" or \"I'll be thinking of you\" works just fine for nearly every situation. Never try to get creative. Never say that the deceased \"is in a better place\" or otherwise imply that it's good that they died - no \"his suffering is over\" or \"God wanted him for something special\" or anything like that. If they say it, you can agree with it, but don't be the one to say it. Also don't suggest you'll pray for them unless you are *certain* that they will appreciate this sentiment - people who have a difficult relationship with religion sometimes struggle to hear that, even though of course they know it's well-intentioned.\n\n> If it were me, I sure as hell would not want people coming up to me at work about something extremely personal as it would cause me to cry and give me a lot of grief while I'm just trying to get through my day.\n\nI promise you, she's already sad about her son. You're not going to remind her of him. He's already there.\n\nOn that note, I'm sorry that your mother is the way she is.

So that is a good way of showing condolences.", "Suggesting OP should strategically approach and comfort this grieving woman in the hopes she'll become some sort of surrogate mother is very, very weird and inappropriate.", "A lifelong friendship? Sounds unrealistic, this isn't some Disney movie. Perhaps Adi doesn't want to talk about this in her place of employment with a teenager she has seen 3 times before.\n\nSome people just want to get on and not be reminded of their loss all the time by strangers.", "They might be a small comfort or they might bring her grief to the fore and turn her into a sobbing mess in front of a teen she barely knows in a place she's trying to work.", "Or Adi may be relieved she's able to escape the reality of having lost her child by being somewhere she doesn't have to acknowledge it for a few hours.

This is why I added my upbringing to my post because I feel that it is very specific to myself.\n\nI do not know how the average person feels about it which is why I posted.", "Not necessarily.  Everyone is so stuck on what they're sure anyone who is grieving would want.  But the reality is that you do not know what Adi wants.  Neither do I.  Neither does this kid, and based on her description of her mother I wouldn't trust her mother's judgment either.  \n\nIt may surprise you but some people do not want condolences from someone they barely know and who did not know the deceased person.", "I would like for her to feel good and comfortable.

That is, IMO, sufficient.", "Not hoping, being caring opening herself up to possibility.", "We're all different. For me personally it would mean you know, you cared enough to show me some support.", "I would absolutely hate getting a physical condolence card from someone I barely know.
