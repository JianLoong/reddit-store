I don\u2019t mean that as in your son could grow up to be bad in any way, I just mean that the love and pride from you might not something that would be prominent in his life, depending on how it goes. Therefore he might then read the letter and it not mean much to him. Then he\u2019d maybe feel a bit awkward, not knowing what to do with the emotions and thoughts conveyed. \n\nAs you\u2019d written a letter for every eventuality, it might seem a bit impersonal if your son was actually interested. As in, for the scenario that he actually has, the letter wouldn\u2019t be your personal reaction to the exact situation that he\u2019s going through, it would just be generic thoughts about the topic that encompasses the situation he\u2019s in. So it might just lack that personal touch. Also I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be lots of the same things across the different letters. He might come to realise that. \n\nAlso, your wife and I\u2019m sure others are going to be there to give him the support, love and pride that he needs. So yours probably isn\u2019t needed on top of theirs. And if you put yours alongside theirs, your son may just benefit from theirs more than yours because he\u2019s never met you so could find it easier to take from the support your wife and others are giving. \n\nAs I say, those are just the ones I can think of and of course I know that you had the best intentions at hand.

In retrospect, an absolutely ridiculous thing to believe, borne out of a life of self-esteem issues and a feeling of imposing myself on others, but nonetheless it is what I believed.\n\nAs you can probably imagine, the reason I'm mentioning this is because when my grandmother died, she died not really knowing who her grandchild was, and *I* live on, not knowing how she would react. If she had left me something like that, if she had known, if I had said or similar, have been things that I have reflected on many times alone ever since.

You hide those letters, put them in a security deposit box so they don't get the chance to get ahold of those letters and destroy them because if they feel justified and believe you owe them an apology, I wouldn't put it past them. I'm so proud of your spouse as well. Shiny spine for days. Give em a big ol hug and kiss for sticking by your side on this. Also to add, glad you're healthy and you'll be sticking around :)", "THEY'RE THE A**SSHOLE !!\nhands down. period. full stop.\n\nhow vile & disgusting of your in-laws to invade such a private repository of your family's life together.\n\ni'd cut off communication if at all possible until if & when *they* realize how repugnant they have been.\n\ngods'speed \ud83d\ude4f\u2665\ufe0f", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" MIL was being nosy and when she was alone\"  Kick your In Laws out of your life. They are AHs for snooping, so do not allow them into your home ever again. And STOP discussing this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not apologize, THEY are the AHs here.", "NTA. It is absolutely amazing how hypocritical ILs are. Do they really think snooping isn't a horrible way to treat people? That they never had the right to read those letters in the first place? That if anyone should apologize, it's them for violating your privacy and your wife's privacy?", "NTA and I am so happy for you to get the correct diagnosis! I teared up a little reading this. You are an amazing parent.", "NTA. Fuck them off out of your life", ">They confessed to reading the letters and then accused me of trying to make my son gay or trans\n\nNTA - It would be a long time before the IL saw their Grand kids ever again. As a minimum they owe you your wife a HUGE apology for violating your privacy. After that, knowing what bigots and AHs they are, they would never be left alone with your kids. NO weekends over, no vacations w/o one of you there to protect them.", "If one has to explain it to you...", "op=NTA\n\nThey read stuff they weren't supposed to read and then judged you for it.  Feck them(and the sister). \n\nNot sure I'd want these people around my kids.  But you and wife need to make your own decision.   \n\nPS you sound like you want to be an awesome parent.  And your wife wants your kid to know that.", "What a wonderful person you are OP, and you\u2019re definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nMy mom died from cancer less than a year before I realized that I'm trans, and it left me with a lot of conflicting emotions around her because I don't know how she would have reacted. My dad tries (when he eventually realizes he has to), would she have? Would she have accepted me? I don't know.\n\nThat you tried to make sure that your child would know that you loved them, and that you were proud of them no matter what. That you tried to cover any situation you could think of. To make sure that after you were gone, they knew that if there had been any way for you to be there to support them in person, you would. Unquestionably.\n\nIt is also a wonderful way of one day being able to show them that you wanted them. Not just wanting a baby, or a child. You wanted them as an hormonal, argumentative, struggling teen. As the adult walking away, and leaving home to find their own path. You wanted the opportunity to watch them grow into becoming themselves, regardless of what that would look like.\n\nI think that's wonderful, and that your in-laws are unwilling to recognize that is entirely on them.\n\n(Also, in my opinion, I think you (or your wife) should do something like that for any other kids you have as well. Both because you never know what could happen, but also because one day, in the far future, your child would be standing with those letters in hand and know with absolute certainty that \"From day one, my parents loved me unconditionally\")", "NTA. Their ignorance is sad.", "NTA.\n\nTwo words for your in-laws, and they rhyme with \"tuck\" and \"hem.\"\n\nYou sound like an incredible, emulate-able ( and if that's not a word, let's make it one) and loving parent.

These people would no longer be welcomed into my home. NTA.", "Love this!"]}
