{"id": 6049, "submission_id": "zzbv39", "title": "AITA for Making Noise in the Gym?", "selftext": "I (26M) came back to my suburban hometown for the holidays and signed up for a gym membership at the local Planet Fitness to tide me over while I was away from home. I've been going to the gym for \\~5 years now and think I'm familiar with typical gym etiquette, but maybe I'm off..?\n\nToday, I was doing chest flys on the cable machine at a fairly heavy weight for me. At the end of the set - as usual - I'd stop, let go of one side near the pulley, and then aimed to let go of the other somewhat near the other pulley (as the other pulley would pull me after letting go of one side). Given this was the cable machine, it made a decent amount of noise at the end of every set when I let go (but I wasn't making noise in between reps and it's not like I was letting go from full extension).\n\nAfter two sets, a person (30-35M) came up to me and admittedly asked me politely to make less noise. Fair enough. EDIT: For clarity, this person was another gym goer - not an employee.\n\nAfterward, I tried to more gently let go of the cables near the pulleys (maybe 4-6 inches on both sides). This still made a bit of noise, but no more than any other machine might make.\n\nThe guy came back and said something along the lines of: \"I already asked you to stop nicely. This is dangerous and also might crack the weights. I'm not going to ask you again.\" There was a bit of back and forth but I said \"I am putting it down lightly. I'm not going to gently place / touch down the weights. Letting it go near touching is already more than a person typically does.\" He also said his safety worry was that the noise might distract people lifting weights, but who doesn't expect noise in the gym..?\n\nFirst time this has happened to me. Normally I have my headphones in so I've never thought about this either when I use the machine or others do. AITA (or in the wrong)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: This blew up a bit more than I was expecting but seems like there's a bit of a theme with the comments. Worth calling out two things:\n\n1. PF staff was never involved and, whether or not there is a policy, I'm not sure if that's relevant here given PF didn't feel it necessary to say anything - I've done this exercise here for a few days now, and I think the noise is a lot less than some of you are assuming. Honestly, I think the guy went and searched out for PF staff (he wandered through the different areas at one point), but, for whatever reason, they declined to get involved.\n2. The way the exercise is set up, the weight does not return to rest at the end of a rep/set - the weight is indeed controlled throughout the entire exercise. Given two cable machines (left and right) are used for the exercise, it's pretty hard to return the weight gently at any meaningful weight because you are off balance once one side is put down.\n\nBelow is the exercise in question, but it's important to note the machines I used are two separate machines that were a bit further away. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5uWfxV0piE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5uWfxV0piE) ", "created_utc": 1672435204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzbv39/aita_for_making_noise_in_the_gym/", "score": 2164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not even familiar with Planet Fitness so I know nothing about that, but it's pretty common knowledge for anyone who had high school physical education to not let the weights slam at the end of your set and always do a controlled release (both from a noise perspective and just respecting the equipment so it stays in good working order for the high volume of people using it).  Accidentally slamming them (even from 4-6\") once is one thing - you misjudge the weight or the distance and then readjust.  But continuously doing it?  Nope.  I think you're underestimating how other people behave because everyone I know where I work out are very conscientious about not letting the weights slam and do a controlled release bringing them to a rest.", "YTA - I was leaning toward NTA, until I read that you just weren't going to gently place/touch down the weights.

The first is that the mild \"weight slamming\" which your neurotic gym adversary complained about would be tolerated in virtually every gym except Planet Fitness. Gold's Gym has a rule against slamming and dropping weights, but if you spend a lot of time working out there or anywhere else with the same rule, you will find that light dropping of plates and weights is virtually always tolerated. It is really unusual for anyone to approach you in the gym about noise that is less than egregious, because most people who are working out to build muscle eventually push to failure... which means plates can clack. Sometimes you need to drop weights to avoid injury. Sometimes it's actually more dangerous to set weights down softly. Almost no one cares.  \n\n\nThe second is that you made an effort to quiet down after the guy asked you to do so. If you were the asshole, you would have told the guy to blow you and then slam the weights harder out of spite. Instead, you did what most kind/agreeable would do and honored the stranger's request.

Not only can you do repeatedly the same swift movement but you can also hold that same amount of weight longer by slowly lowering it down. It's better on your body to only work within your full capacity, lifting and setting down gently. It's not a competition with others, only with yourself. The finish line is being able to put down your tools with care, just like your caring for your bodies limitations as you workout.

Who utilizes their membership the least? Regular people who are intimidated by gym-bros. \n\nPlanet Fitness made a funny name to humorously villainize an intimidating group that they don\u2019t even want using their facilities, which allows them to make a ton of money on lots and lots of memberships that are rarely ever used; more memberships but less wear and tear on facilities and equipment, less operating costs, etc.", "Competitive powerlifters (different from Olympic weightlifters) will do this as that's how they do it in competition. The reason for that is to not waste energy lowering controlling the bar on the way down, and to lift more weight. \nHowever, you won't see many competitive powerlifters in regular gyms, most people in those just do it because they've seen it online, think it looks cool and you add more weight on the bar.", "I think the point is that there should be no \"pieces of metal dropping onto each other\" at all.

Planet fitness is not meant for you then. They want everyone to feel comfortable, and yeah it does distract people when they hear weights slamming down, doesn\u2019t matter if they are close to the weight, they are still making noise.

But it was done thank goodness. Several weeks later I personally received a letter from a collections agency for the cost of a months membership. I couldn't believe it.

If you're lifting heavy, you're usually putting most of your effort into lifting/controlling the weight and not into making sure you're completely silent - and it's pretty natural to make noise when you're exerting yourself.
