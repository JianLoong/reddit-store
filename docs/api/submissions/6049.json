I've been going to the gym for \\~5 years now and think I'm familiar with typical gym etiquette, but maybe I'm off..?\n\nToday, I was doing chest flys on the cable machine at a fairly heavy weight for me. At the end of the set - as usual - I'd stop, let go of one side near the pulley, and then aimed to let go of the other somewhat near the other pulley (as the other pulley would pull me after letting go of one side). Given this was the cable machine, it made a decent amount of noise at the end of every set when I let go (but I wasn't making noise in between reps and it's not like I was letting go from full extension).\n\nAfter two sets, a person (30-35M) came up to me and admittedly asked me politely to make less noise. Fair enough. EDIT: For clarity, this person was another gym goer - not an employee. \n\nAfterward, I tried to more gently let go of the cables near the pulleys (maybe 4-6 inches on both sides). This still made a bit of noise, but no more than any other machine might make.\n\nThe guy came back and said something along the lines of: \"I already asked you to stop nicely. This is dangerous and also might crack the weights. I'm not going to ask you again.\" There was a bit of back and forth but I said \"I am putting it down lightly. I'm not going to gently place / touch down the weights. Letting it go near touching is already more than a person typically does.\" He also said his safety worry was that the noise might distract people lifting weights, but who doesn't expect noise in the gym..?\n\nFirst time this has happened to me.

I'm not even familiar with Planet Fitness so I know nothing about that, but it's pretty common knowledge for anyone who had high school physical education to not let the weights slam at the end of your set and always do a controlled release (both from a noise perspective and just respecting the equipment so it stays in good working order for the high volume of people using it).  Accidentally slamming them (even from 4-6\") once is one thing - you misjudge the weight or the distance and then readjust.  But continuously doing it?  Nope.

The first is that the mild \"weight slamming\" which your neurotic gym adversary complained about would be tolerated in virtually every gym except Planet Fitness. Gold's Gym has a rule against slamming and dropping weights, but if you spend a lot of time working out there or anywhere else with the same rule, you will find that light dropping of plates and weights is virtually always tolerated. It is really unusual for anyone to approach you in the gym about noise that is less than egregious, because most people who are working out to build muscle eventually push to failure... which means plates can clack. Sometimes you need to drop weights to avoid injury. Sometimes it's actually more dangerous to set weights down softly. Almost no one cares.  \n\n\nThe second is that you made an effort to quiet down after the guy asked you to do so. If you were the asshole, you would have told the guy to blow you and then slam the weights harder out of spite. Instead, you did what most kind/agreeable would do and honored the stranger's request.

They still make noise and can break the floor if you drop them at the wrong place.\n\nThere's also zero spotters because it's super dangerous to have anyone around you when you yeet a barbell from ground to overhead and there's 0 safe way to spot that.
