I've been going to the gym for \\~5 years now and think I'm familiar with typical gym etiquette, but maybe I'm off..?\n\nToday, I was doing chest flys on the cable machine at a fairly heavy weight for me. At the end of the set - as usual - I'd stop, let go of one side near the pulley, and then aimed to let go of the other somewhat near the other pulley (as the other pulley would pull me after letting go of one side). Given this was the cable machine, it made a decent amount of noise at the end of every set when I let go (but I wasn't making noise in between reps and it's not like I was letting go from full extension).\n\nAfter two sets, a person (30-35M) came up to me and admittedly asked me politely to make less noise. Fair enough. EDIT: For clarity, this person was another gym goer - not an employee. \n\nAfterward, I tried to more gently let go of the cables near the pulleys (maybe 4-6 inches on both sides). This still made a bit of noise, but no more than any other machine might make.\n\nThe guy came back and said something along the lines of: \"I already asked you to stop nicely. This is dangerous and also might crack the weights. I'm not going to ask you again.\" There was a bit of back and forth but I said \"I am putting it down lightly. I'm not going to gently place / touch down the weights. Letting it go near touching is already more than a person typically does.\" He also said his safety worry was that the noise might distract people lifting weights, but who doesn't expect noise in the gym..?\n\nFirst time this has happened to me. Normally I have my headphones in so I've never thought about this either when I use the machine or others do.

I'm not even familiar with Planet Fitness so I know nothing about that, but it's pretty common knowledge for anyone who had high school physical education to not let the weights slam at the end of your set and always do a controlled release (both from a noise perspective and just respecting the equipment so it stays in good working order for the high volume of people using it).  Accidentally slamming them (even from 4-6\") once is one thing - you misjudge the weight or the distance and then readjust.  But continuously doing it?  Nope.  I think you're underestimating how other people behave because everyone I know where I work out are very conscientious about not letting the weights slam and do a controlled release bringing them to a rest.", "YTA - I was leaning toward NTA, until I read that you just weren't going to gently place/touch down the weights.  This is why people can't go to gyms and use anything that isn't cracked, warped, or bent.   Yes, no gym is noise free, but that doesn't mean it has to be an obnoxious experience.  Working out is hard enough with a headache, or getting hurt because some fool abused the equipment and it broke on you.\n\nIf it isn't your personal equipment, treat it right.  To your credit, at least you weren't doing the barbarian yell, before throwing an olympic bar, with more weight than you could safely control, down from shoulder height.", "YTA - PF has a pretty well known 'no lunk' policy.  Everyone agrees to it when they sign up.  You were quietly spoken to and still couldn't keep it down.  You're lucky they didn't sound the klaxon and hit the strobe on the wall, TBH.", "YTA because Planet Fitness has been known for discouraging any noise for over a decade now. It's hard to imagine you didn't know this as they have a prominent \"lunk alarm.\"", "Dropping a weight 4-6 inches is slamming them. YTA here.", " PF has a notorious *lunk alarm*. Honestly though if you were warned once already and still continued going against norms, then YTA. Pretty cut and dry.", ">I'm not going to gently place / touch down the weights. Letting it go near touching\n\nYTA.  Gently placing or allowing the weight to touch the stack is exactly what you're supposed to do.  You refuse to do this, causing the weights to crash down.  Even at a low height, this is unacceptable.  It will make a lot of noise, and risks cracking weights.  It can also cause damage to the cables and handles.  There's even a risk that the handles will swing and strike you or someone nearby.", "YTA- \n\nIf you're improperly using a machine (making a huge clacking noise by dropping the weights every rep) than yes you're an AH.

Planet Fitness is extremely well known for having policies against excessive noise making, and thus you should be aware to use weights that you can still control through the full range of motion. Since you're violating a known social norm and refusing to change your behavior when asked, you are the AH, even if your behavior would be acceptable in other gyms.", "YTA. Dude, put the weights down, don't let them slam.", "YTA. Weights are not meant to be slammed. There\u2019s absolutely no reason for you to be making so much noise.", "YTA.  This kind of stuff is frowned upon at planet fitness.  It\u2019s not a gym for serious gym rats.  It\u2019s rude af to slam the weights.  I have a cable machine in my home gym.  I don\u2019t mind friends using it but I have a zero tolerance for slamming weights.  I have invested tens of thousands of dollars in my home gym and I won\u2019t have it wrecked by people who cannot be respectful of my property.", "YTA - If you need to slam your weights down instead of placing gently, they're too heavy for you.", "YTA, I hate planet fitness but they are very much \"no noise allowed\" at their gyms. You have to follow their rules.", "YTA\nWhy not buy your own crazy ass expensive equipment and then drop the weights.\nHow much will it cost to fix? How long will the machine be down?\n\nHonestly.

The first is that the mild \"weight slamming\" which your neurotic gym adversary complained about would be tolerated in virtually every gym except Planet Fitness. Gold's Gym has a rule against slamming and dropping weights, but if you spend a lot of time working out there or anywhere else with the same rule, you will find that light dropping of plates and weights is virtually always tolerated. It is really unusual for anyone to approach you in the gym about noise that is less than egregious, because most people who are working out to build muscle eventually push to failure... which means plates can clack. Sometimes you need to drop weights to avoid injury. Sometimes it's actually more dangerous to set weights down softly. Almost no one cares.  \n\n\nThe second is that you made an effort to quiet down after the guy asked you to do so. If you were the asshole, you would have told the guy to blow you and then slam the weights harder out of spite. Instead, you did what most kind/agreeable would do and honored the stranger's request. Whether or not you did a \"good enough\" job for anyone but him is unknown, but the noise issue seems irrelevant compared to 1) his choice to escalate the situation with a threatening tone, 2) his sanctimonious/narcissistic reasons for riding your ass about noise in the gym (protecting equipment that isn't his, playing gym lifeguard), and 3) the fact that gyms are generally noisy and no one gives a shit, unless you work out at Planet Fitness.", "\"No lunk\",  ya learn something every day", "They said \"lunk\", but I knew they were thinking \"hunk\".", "What does that mean?", "I think you misspelled \"at all.\"  Unless you own them, don't drop them.", "I am guessing you have never done olympic lifting or deadlifts.", "False", "[deleted]", "Yea op sounds kind of annoying, but random members coming up and aggressively criticizing is much worse\n\n>\"I'm not going to ask you again.\"\n\nWell that's a relief", "Casual sexism, really cool.
