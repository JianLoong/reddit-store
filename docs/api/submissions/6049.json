I've been going to the gym for \\~5 years now and think I'm familiar with typical gym etiquette, but maybe I'm off..?\n\nToday, I was doing chest flys on the cable machine at a fairly heavy weight for me. At the end of the set - as usual - I'd stop, let go of one side near the pulley, and then aimed to let go of the other somewhat near the other pulley (as the other pulley would pull me after letting go of one side). Given this was the cable machine, it made a decent amount of noise at the end of every set when I let go (but I wasn't making noise in between reps and it's not like I was letting go from full extension).\n\nAfter two sets, a person (30-35M) came up to me and admittedly asked me politely to make less noise. Fair enough. EDIT: For clarity, this person was another gym goer - not an employee. \n\nAfterward, I tried to more gently let go of the cables near the pulleys (maybe 4-6 inches on both sides). This still made a bit of noise, but no more than any other machine might make.\n\nThe guy came back and said something along the lines of: \"I already asked you to stop nicely. This is dangerous and also might crack the weights. I'm not going to ask you again.\" There was a bit of back and forth but I said \"I am putting it down lightly. I'm not going to gently place / touch down the weights. Letting it go near touching is already more than a person typically does.\" He also said his safety worry was that the noise might distract people lifting weights, but who doesn't expect noise in the gym..?\n\nFirst time this has happened to me.

I'm not even familiar with Planet Fitness so I know nothing about that, but it's pretty common knowledge for anyone who had high school physical education to not let the weights slam at the end of your set and always do a controlled release (both from a noise perspective and just respecting the equipment so it stays in good working order for the high volume of people using it).  Accidentally slamming them (even from 4-6\") once is one thing - you misjudge the weight or the distance and then readjust.  But continuously doing it?  Nope.

The first is that the mild \"weight slamming\" which your neurotic gym adversary complained about would be tolerated in virtually every gym except Planet Fitness. Gold's Gym has a rule against slamming and dropping weights, but if you spend a lot of time working out there or anywhere else with the same rule, you will find that light dropping of plates and weights is virtually always tolerated. It is really unusual for anyone to approach you in the gym about noise that is less than egregious, because most people who are working out to build muscle eventually push to failure... which means plates can clack. Sometimes you need to drop weights to avoid injury. Sometimes it's actually more dangerous to set weights down softly. Almost no one cares.  \n\n\nThe second is that you made an effort to quiet down after the guy asked you to do so. If you were the asshole, you would have told the guy to blow you and then slam the weights harder out of spite. Instead, you did what most kind/agreeable would do and honored the stranger's request.

I'd understand if it was power lifting like squatting, benching, or presses, but a _cable machine_??? Absolutely you can control your noises.", "Not false. If you can't put it down without dropping it, don't pick it up.", "Oh man, if I ever work out anywhere but home I better avoid going there. I don't grunt so much as loudly and obnoxiously whine, but they'd be ringing that damn thing at me every leg day.", "I\u2019ve heard it before, I thought it was trigger by the sounds, didn\u2019t realize it was the employees doing it", "I've heard the alarm go off...my brother caused it", "I didn\u2019t think the alarm was even real because but someone sounded the one at mine recently! \n\nOh and op, YTA", "I do deadlifts and dropping them isn\u2019t a thing.", "Meh. Let the dude workout. He\u2019s not harming himself or the equipment.", "False. When lighting to failure that is just not possible. The whole point to lifting for many is to put on muscle not use lean it out. For light weight I absolutely agree with you though.", "This is my new life motto", "For light weight sure but when lifting to failure he is absolutely correct. IMO if you can lift your arms when done then you didn't do enough.", "Lol! Was he picking things up and putting them down?", "ohh i see, thanks", "You think letting a cable with 50lbs loaded on it drop from 6 inches is going to result in a \"clink\"? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Please for the love of god shut the fuck up and just go to gym", "If he\u2019s letting the weights drop he absolutely is hurting the equipment.", "Cable machines are on fairly thin metal guide rods. They are absolutely not meant to endure large amounts of weight drop pressure.\n\nIf it's enough to make noise that bothers other people, it's way more than the machine was designed to endure.", "I would say improper lifting causing stress on joints tendons and ligaments, not to mention potentially cracking of the plates and cables would be... Harming. But go off ig", "He's letting the weights drop on a cable machine. He's absolutely harming the equipment", "Chest flies on the cable machine? There is literally no way that he shouldn't be able to set the weights down gently on both sides, even with the full weight stack on there.\n\nIf you are letting the cable machine handle go 6 inches from dead, you're doing something very wrong.", "Not gonna matter bruh, the downvoters are all the type that Planet Fitness exists to serve. No one truly serious will lift there because they they have almost no free weights as their usual clientele would be able to work with them.", "Bro- I give him the benefit of knowing what he is doing. It\u2019s just a different gym with different etiquette.", "Thanks! Noisy workouts are apparently the hill I am dying on.", "It is also a gym that specifically says to don't do things like that. It is literally written on the walls in every one. It doesn't matter what he used to do. Where he is now, it is an asshole move.", "I'm not referring to PF's rules regarding noise. \nIf you're not able to control the weights on the last rep, they're too heavy for you. You risk a major injury. \n\nIf you want to work out with heavy-ass weights, always work out with a buddy who can be your spotter. They can catch the weights before you fatigue, preventing you from dropping the weights and potentially buckling your joints.", "I\u2019ve never been able to stick with a gym, but I joined PF this year and I\u2019ve finally stuck with it. Everyone is so nice, the facilities are immaculate, and I love working out with teens and seniors at the same time. The atmosphere is absolutely working for me.", "Yup we covered that elsewhere."]}
