I have always been against spankings but my bf has no problem with it because \u201cit worked for him\u201d. Shortly after our youngest was born his mom came to visit for 2 weeks. About 5 days after being there she had gotten on to our oldest for something that she had no proof that she did, she just assumed. I told my MIL that if she didn\u2019t see her do it then she can\u2019t get on to her (especially because this isn\u2019t something she would do) and she went off on me telling me that my daughter isn\u2019t an angel. This then led into spankings, I told my MIL that she is not allowed to spank my kids. I had previously told her this over text a few months prior and she denied my request. I just believe that it isn\u2019t a grandparents place to spank since that is how I grew up. We argued back and forth about it but then it was let go and I was thinking it was resolved. A few hours later my bf came home and my MIL ended up bringing it up again. Saying she has a right to spank because they are her grandkids and if she isn\u2019t allowed to spank them then don\u2019t bring them to her house. This blew up into a big yelling argument between me and her and my bf took her side saying she can do what she wants and that I need to go to my room to cool down. I left and for the rest of the 2 weeks I was getting the silent treatment from both of them. However, my MIL would shit talk below her breath anytime I was around. I would ignore it but I was over it at one point and addressed it. I told her I hadn\u2019t said anything to her all week and she needs to stop talking about me under her breath. My bf them came around the corner and took up for her again and told me to go back to my room and calm down. After she left me and my bf were on rocks because I was so upset he didn\u2019t take up for me and ultimately was a big reason we broke up (backed by a whole bunch of other stuff).

You\u2019re protecting your kids. If you\u2019re in the US, a lot of judges will put a \u201cno corporal punishments\u201d rule in the parenting plan.

I don't know where you live, but here in the US, that's physical abuse! You are the mother! You can call the cops and you can have her arrested!\n\nYou have every right to yell at his mother.

She's the AH for demanding to be allowed to physically abuse your kids. \n\nI'm glad you dumped the bf. He shouldn't be around kids if he thinks spanking is okay.", "NTA at all. Grandparents should not be punishing when parents are there. And, if you say no to any type of punishment it is off the table. \n\nI can't get over the fact that you were sent to your room!!!!! That would be the final stray for me.", "<<..ultimately was a big reason we broke up...>>\n\nThere's no current conflict to judge here.

If the father doesn't want you to be an equal parent, your relationship was bound for the rocks from the beginning.", "NTA!!! When dealing with custody of the kids, make sure you detail all of this for the judge, they usually frown at spanking and physical forms of punishment.", "NTA.\n\nYou're allowed to yell at people who aren't the parent of the child and think they have any right to spank them.", "NTA. I would have left with my kids and left this dude with his mommy. If she touches your child file a police report and press charges.  Be done with him.", "Nope NTA and good you broke up with him. They sound like quite the pair.", "NTA and you might consider revisiting your custody agreement. Your exMIL does not have your permission to discipline and to do so should violate her right to see your kids. Good luck and stick to your guns!!", "NTA at all, and good for you for protecting your kids.

If you're not okay with someone essentially hitting your kids and don't even have an established warning/method in place hell NO does anybody have permission to \"do what they want\" with your child!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA that if gramma wants to take her mean hands out of the picture, let her!", "NTA\n\nTell MIL if you get even a hint that she has assaulted one of your children. You will be going straight to the police.", "NTA \n\nI'm glad he's now your ex. Did he think he was your parent sending you to your room. WTF As you're both the kids parents then you BOTH have to come to a mutual decision on who can discipline your kids. If you don't agree with him then he was to respect your wishes and his mom can kick rocks and discipline herself. Just because she's the grandparent doesn't make her the actual parent. She doesn't get a say in if she can discipline or not.", "NTA for yelling at your MIL but you would be TA if you continue to live there with your kids. The woman is spanking your kids for things she *presumes* they are doing? That's abuse. Grandparents do not get to choose how to parent. They had their chance to do that already. Your boyfriend should grow a spine too, he shouldn't be belittling your decisions in front of his mother.", "INFO: why is your MIL so thirsty for smacking kids? Why does she so desperately want to hit them??", "spanking a child only teaches them to expect pain.

I didn't realize this, but a therapist told me that even the silent treatment is considered abuse. I'm glad this guy is her ex.

Ummm was he actually telling you to \u201c go to your room?\u201d I would have broken up with him the first time he said that. You are not his child. Everybody has their own thoughts on spankings but definitely a grandparent shouldn\u2019t do it. She seems to have anger issues. Young kids are so active and maybe she is just too old to watch them.", "NTA. But were seriously accepting your boyfriend ordering you to your room? Wth? I can\u2019t get over that. Also the parents decide on the spanking thing. Anyone else needs to abide by their decision. The problem is that 1/ you ex and you didn\u2019t agree and 2/ he kept defending his mother. Big red flag.

Do not EVER let either of them be alone with your children.  In fact, never let your \"MIL\" be around the children, at all.  I'm betting you do not live in the US, because I can't imagine someone trying to banish an adult to their room over this kind of disagreement.  I don't know what the laws are where you live, but do your best to get a legal injunction against them having contact or control over the children.
