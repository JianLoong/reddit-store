Actually, she did but, like you, she came back. Fast forward and my first memories are my parents smoking crack in the car with us after going on a drug run and our car getting shot at. My first memories are my dad and mother screaming at each other when my dad came home after weeks of being MIA and me lying awake in bed whispering to myself \"please God, let them divorce, please God let them divorce\" over and over and over again. My first memories are watching my dad choke my mom against a wall until she passed out and then tackling my brother when he ran to call the police. \n\nShe finally left when I was 10, which wasn't early enough to protect me from the life long anxiety, depression, and cptsd I have struggled with since I was a small child. It certainly didn't help that she left him, rushed into another relationship only to repeat the process but again, staying for the stability only compounded all the things I already mentioned. \n\nI think you need to go to therapy and work on your past traumas and your hurt instead of allowing those projections keep you in a guilt spiral that prevents you from actually protecting your child/children. \n\nI know these comments seem harsh but I guarantee every one of them is coming from a place of concern and more often than not, that concern is from lived experience. Please listen.", "Sometimes divorce is the only correct option. When it comes to abuse, the abuser RARELY improves. They pretend to improve to get back into good graces and then take it all away again and get just as bad, if not worse. You are not protecting your son or your family by trying to reconcile, you're probably actively making it worse. That's probably why your mother did what she did. If my mother had just left my father when he started hitting her kids from her first marriage, I wouldn't exist but I also wouldn't have been abused. \"Trying\" is not always good. You should have never started speaking to him again, he's already trying to abuse you AGAIN by gaslighting. As soon as he gets into your home, it will all come to a head and he will either relapse or become a while new monster.
