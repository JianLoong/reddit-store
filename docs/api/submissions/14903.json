During this  time, he bought a house with his 82-year-old mother (which was always  his plan before I met him). We eventually worked things out and started  dating again.\n\nWe were together  four years before he asked me to move into his new home and then a year  after he proposed and another year we were married. So we have been  together for about 7 years.\n\nLiving  with his mother never bothered me until after the wedding. Now  everything she does bothers me. I am in therapy and we are working  through why I don't get along with her and the only solution seems to  move out.\n\nSo... The problem:\n\nWe  are about to go on three years of me living with my now husband... I  haven't put much into decor or nesting because every time I do, his  mother says she wants to do something else... So I wait and wait. Summer  is coming up and I want to redo the kitchen and update the patio with  flooring.\n\nToday, I started hanging  up pictures and I got paint samples for our room. I told her my plans  and she said to wait on the patio because she wants to do the floors.  Btw.. she painted our common area white - which my husband and I do not  agree upon. So I expressed what MY HUSBAND and I want for the patio. She  says that doesn't fit her idea and that right now the patio looks  embarrassing (I picked out a patio sofa and our cats like to sit on the  furniture.  She said the patio looks dirty and she wants her son out  there grilling more often. (Ummm...sorry didn't know you were married to  your son)\n\nMy husband has been  really supportive and sticks up for me when I am upset. But I honestly  cannot live like this. Am I the bad guy for asking for my husband and me  to move out? He has already said yes, but I think when actions are  called - he won't make the move.\n\nI feel torn because she owns half the house...

He needs to talk to his mother and find some sort of common ground, or push selling/her buying out the house.\n\nYour MIL is TA for refusing to compromise with her son, especially if he has been actually supporting you as you say.  Is she able to live on her own?\n\nThis seems harsher than I intended.  I'm actually quite sorry you are in this situation and I hope you all find a solution that makes everyone happy.

Who, sadly, has just as much of a right to \u201cdecorate\u201d as you do. Yay :(\n\nIf your husband *really* supported you, he would be taking real action into moving out. Not just lip service.

Your MIL needs to understand that the house is not just hers.\n\n>But it's like look lady, you aren't going to be around forever..\n\nThen you can just wait for her to die to change the house instead of expecting her to live the way you want because she is old.

It\u2019s obviously true, she won\u2019t live forever, but she\u2019s alive now, so she absolutely gets a say.\n\nKeep in mind that as she paid for half the house, she gets as much say as you and your husband combined!\n\nI don\u2019t think you can work out this dynamic. Living with other people is always hard, even more so with generational differences. It looks like she considered herself more of an adult than you, which is why she probably thinks she gets the last say when it comes to wallcolours and patio floors. \n\nI also wonder what kind of agreement your husband made with his mother in regards to moving out/selling his \u201ehalf\u201c of the house?", "NAH.\n\nHowever, you missed a huge red flag.  Regardless of the reason for the situation, you never even THINK about marrying someone who is living with their mother.  That hard, fast rule is 1000% more relevant if the person deliberately chose to live with their mother and intends to keep living with mom after marriage.\n\nI wouldn't say anybody is an AH in this situation.  But we need a new judgement for this one.  YAYOWE  (you are your own worst enemy)", "NTA and WOW. Sorry you're living in this situation this sounds like my hell. \n\nI'll keep it simple and short. You definitely need to move out ASAP or as soon as feasible. You're right that she owns half the house but that is fine they can sell it and split the proceeds or she can buy him out of his half. Your marriage and household decisions should be up to you and your husband. Unfortunately, as things stand right now, you're basically living in 50% of her home and as a result, she has a say in these things.", "NTA - she owns half the house, but that doesnt mean you half to stay or that she makes every decision. Your husband also owns half the house, and it doesnt sound like she cares about his input either.", "NTA, but you moved into a bad living situation.   I understand your pain.  You may want to discuss selling the house,  with your husband and you two getting your own place.  What you are doing now does not sound sustainable.", "NTA, but while the house is half hers, she gets a say\n\nI agree that your best course of action is to move out, however it\u2019s not great optics that you are \u201cmoving out from your 82yo MIL leaving her to fend for herself\u201d\n\nYour MIL should be more accommodating, but the problem is she doesn\u2019t have to.\n\nFor your own sanity, move out,  you will have to do most of the work because it doesn\u2019t sound like your husband will be motivated to.", "NTA and good luck with getting your own place to make into the home you want. \n\nAlso I hope your husband has all the legal ends of this property tied up correctly, if there are siblings or anyone else who feels they might have a claim to it after she passes it might become even more of a headache. \n\nOne of my siblings took a loan for his house with my parents but he pays for everything and always has so they have a section in their will that specifically excludes that home from being considered part of their estate when it comes time to split everything.", "NTA. You want to set up a home you and your husband will be comfortable in, but MIL won't let you, so it's a perfectly reasonable response to move out together.", "NTA.   \nCan you afford to leave her in the house and move somewhere else? Is it possible to do that without making either party homeless of financially destitute?   \nYour husband needs to put his foot down somewhere and sort out this stuff. I would stop talking to your MIL about your plans and just let him handle her.   \nAnd if he has agreed to move out - start finding properties to view and have him tell your MIL that\u2019s your plan (remember: he deals with his mum) and don\u2019t wait for him.

Moving out is your best move.", "NTA but you should really get out of there for your own mental health. Your now husband should have discussed seriously with his mother before buying that house about boundaries between them, with his future wife (no matter if that was you or anyone else) and future kids, arrangements about the handling of the house and, in general, they should have set some rules from back then. It is only logical that at some point more people would be living in this house, so these rules were and are much needed. It's not too late for these rules to be set, but it will be way harder 'cause know both sides will have to compromise and \"sacrifice\" some of their \"rights\", while before the buy it would simply be more of compromises in order to both get what they want (a house). Your husband has to talk with his mother so that she'll realise that you may not have been there when the buying happened, but you're now a member of this family, this is now your home as well, this will be a house that will be left to you two for many many years and, hopefully, will be left to your kids afterwards (if you want to have kids), so some more respect to your opinion wouldn't harm her (you're not a guest there after all). That being said, I don't know if your husband and MIL have \"split\" their power of deciding things for the house in 50-50 or something else, 'cause her painting a room white while even your husband disagreed on shows that she either doesn't respect his say either or she has more power in decisions than him. Either way, move away 'cause right now it doesn't seem like the circumstances are in your favor at all.", "INFO\n\nWhat, exactly, is the arrangement? Did your husband own 100% with his mom as a guest? Or do they own it jointly?? Because in the former, you own half, in the latter you own 1/4.\n\nRegardless, seems like you would all agree on a list of priorities of things that must be done and a general order for completion. \n\nShe's 82 years old. I think when you sit down to talk about potential house projects--which I'm assuming you currently do with hubs & exclude her?--the three of you should participate. And frankly I'd give some priority to her needs right now as she's aging and won't be with you forever. If she wants to spend her last few summers on the patio, then redo the patio. Maybe the house can be configured so that she has her own space, and you end up with an income-producing ADU after she's gone?\n\nNo one should paint anything outside one's own bedroom without running it by the other two, though.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow would you ever thing that could be a good idea?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut: it is HER house much more than it is your house - so she gets as much of a vote ay your husband and you together. Respect that, or Move out.", "Uhm, this isn't working out, and it isn't going to work out.  Your MIL has far more power than you do in the home where you live with your husband.  He can stick up for you until the white paint blisters and peels off the walls, but that isn't going to change the situation.\n\nMaybe it's time to sell the house, divide up the assets, and get two separate places to live.  It's clear that you shouldn't be living under the same roof as your MIL, and that's not just because of differences of opinion about decor.\n\nYou deserve to have authority in your own home.

She should be more compromising and willing to work woth OP and the husband. \n\nThe husband should be playing mediator, which is a tough position to be in but there should be a way to keep everyone mostly content for now. Maybe they split up which rooms each get to remodel/ decorate, or maybe they both agree to hold off from any big changes  for now and both go to therapy to figure out why they are no longer able to coexist. I also don't think it is necessarly reasonable to expect the husband to move out and leave his mid 80's mother by herself, although he does need to support his partner.
