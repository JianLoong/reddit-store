You are also under no obligation to house them while they're in town. They shouldn't expect to stay with you.", "You should just be honest.  The fact is you obviously haven\u2019t baby-proofed your home and aren\u2019t interested in doing so.  A lot of things were broken last time so you are more than happy to cover the cost of a hotel until he grows up a little more.  \n\nIt\u2019s not the child\u2019s discipline necessarily and I would that topic.  Kids will break things and you would rather accommodate them in a hotel to keep\nit easy for everyone.", "NTA. Absent prior promises, no one, not even your family, has a right to stay in your house. Even offering to pay for a hotel is far outside of your obligations.", "NTA. How entitled can they be, to completely ignore/forget the fact that they allowed their son to trash your house the last time they were there? Did they pay to replace the things their kid broke? I\u2019m guessing no - that you paid to replace them.\n\nI suggest that you call and tell them the truth - otherwise, they\u2019re going to just keep asking in the future.", "NTA. You've even bent over backwards by offering to pay for a hotel. The one major thing you did wrong was offer an excuse. They're not entitled to one. Giving them one just invites argument.\n\nThe answer to \"why?\" is \"That doesn't work for me\". If they press, repeat as necessary. No means no.", "NTA.

YTA for refusing to be honest and set boundaries in YOUR home. Yes, they are your nephews, but they are your things. I'd ask to talk to them.face to face when they do travel to visit and explain you'd love to have them all BUT, you work hard for your home and the things in it and would expect them to teach their children how to respect other people's property. If they understand what is causing you to slightly ostracise them from your home, I'd hope they'd review all their behaviour as well as their kids. I am childless by choice mid 40's two of my 3 siblings all have young children, but they all have ALWAYS  disciplined and bought their children up to respect those who respect them, expecially my home and me. That doesn't mean things don't get broken or messed up here  because they're kids, s#%t happens and I really am not fussed about most material things as I adore all my siblings babies, but it is a great life lesson to teach them and hopefully will make people want them.around if they can show the same respect afforded to them.", "YTA for lying.
