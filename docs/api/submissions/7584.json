Gross.\n\nNTA", "NTA sounds like your dad committed a pretty bad crime and knows that they will still be looking for his DNA later", "NTA, and also him keeping it in a drawer for extended periods of time is doing the opposite of keeping his DNA inaccessible, so his logic is double-twisted", "Please please please come back and post an update on your DNA test results. And don\u2019t forget to load them into gedmatch dotcom", "Yeah, either OPs dad has some intense paranoia going on that he really needs to see a therapist or psychiatrist about, or he's definitely committed some sort of crime he's worried he's about to be caught for. This is totally weird. I'm curious how long this had been going on for, if it is life long or just recent. Either way, completely bizarre.", "I\u2019m scared to ask what the dad makes OP do with her menstrual supplies if this so really about DNA. \nNTA", "Either that or he's a dark sorcerer and a danger to us all. I read the Dresden Files, I know what's up.\n\nNTA OP but suuuuuuuuppppppeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrr SUS.", "Yeah this might be a rare case in which Occam\u2019s razor actually says serial killer. \n\n(Okay maybe not. But it is the first thing I thought of, and if I were OP I wouldn\u2019t rest until my DNA was checked.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 for real!!", "Agree. Flushing it can create plumbing issues, and if rotorooter has to pull a big hair clog out of the mainline, your dad'll REALLY freak.", "But probably don\u2019t mention it to your father. Based on what you\u2019ve said, he may get angrier than is safe.", "But don't really. Because violence is a possibility. Either because you violated his paranoid delusion severely enough, or because he's really a serial killer and he's afraid the database will out him like it did the Golden State Killer.\n\nEither way, throwing it in his face is a potentially dangerous move.", "It's like a messed up Shel Silverstein poem.", "Also, if he\u2019s that worried about someone finding your hair and getting your DNA, it is unbelievably illogical to\u2026 store a massive stash of hair in one easily found place without disposing of it. There\u2019s no internal logic to what he\u2019s doing at all, and this definitely seems like a symptom of some sort of mental illness.", "I didn't know this. Just lay it on the plant's soil?", "No, of course not. So this reasoning at-home doesn't make sense.", "No, don\u2019t take a DNA test - they will find the family! The family is in the Witness Protection Program.", "Just saying, I wouldn\u2019t do anything to help rat out a family member, regardless.", "this was what I thought of honestly", "Or an evil sorcerer!", "This!! \n\nBest case scenario- untreated mental illness\n\nWorst case scenario- he committed a crime with a very long statute of limitations", "For a sustained, specific paranoia that is consistent for years while functioning fairly normally and not deteriorating? It's not paranoid schizophrenia.", "DNA is just in the root of the hair snd not of the hair itself. If you lise a hair naturally, no DNA, just if you rip it out with the root... But i guess people that collect hair in a drawer give a shit about logic, haha. \n\nBut if you want to frame someone with a hair, check if it has still the root. Criminal Handbook - Framing Innocent People 1.01", "Yeah, yeah, it was a joke, I'm not actually recommending this. It's bad to play with someone's paranoia, for both your sakes. Not okay to be petty to mentally ill people, could expose you to danger to provoke abusive people, best you can do is to distance yourself from the person if you feel unsafe.", "If it was, it would just be a line of \u201cEw\u201ds in the shape of a long hair that curls into a drawer, with a kid next to it looking disgusted", "They found the Idaho college murder suspect by genetic genealogy. I\u2019m not saying your dad is a criminal - he might just be paranoid or mentally ill - but the curiosity would be killing me ngl.", "So glad you wouldn't help rape or murder victims get justice.", "Even if he was a serial killer?", "If you switch to cannibalism of meat eaters only you\u2019ll save more animals \n\n/S", "lol now I want to see that\n\npaging /u/Shitty_Watercolour", "So you are saying that OP's dad needs to collect hair from all his family members just in case Cousin Timmy took a DNA test and posted the results?", "INFO: Does he have a cum box?", "BTK was caught because of his arrogance. You're thinking GSK.", "Genetic genealogy. I believe now you have to opt in for the results to be included.", "I guess what I\u2019m saying in this particular instance is that if this person would go to 23 and me specifically to get their familial DNA into a public database on the off chance that their father might\u2019ve done something years and years ago, that is a super weird move loaded with disloyalty that OP has no reason to display.", "Serial killer or child killer, yes. Otherwise, he may have killed somebody long ago that he had a very good reason to kill and is still afraid of getting caught.  I\u2019m just saying my default would be to protect family members, unless there is literally no other choice.", "If there are two things I know about white people, it's that they love Dave Mathew's band, and they are *terrified* of curses.", "BTKs identity was confirmed by his daughters DNA from her college campus clinic.", "I mean, it doesn't *have* to mean your dad is a serial killer. It's possible he's just a garden variety conspiracy nutball...\n\nBut he's definitely not what you might call a normal, sane individual.", "The reality is if he was a criminal and the police wanted his DNA, there are easier sources. Used kleenex and straws and coffee cups are common and would be used way before random garbage hair.", "Dr Kim McMorries was my OB for both my kids when we lived in Nacogdoches, TX. (Normal pregnancies, I had no problem with fertility, my kids are less than 13 months apart! Also, he was right down the street). Super nice guy, except:\n\nhttps://www.texasobserver.org/fertility-fraud-east-texas-kim-mcmorries/\n\nI had already heard about it, and when I searched his name to add the link, his website and webmd came up way before his atrocious behavior.

He was then followed by officers until he left a coffee cup and a tissue in a relatively uncontaminated place, the officers retrieved it, GSK caught.", "The way the genealogical DNA is used is they cast a wide net.  They compare evidence DNA to everyone catalogued to develop suspects.\n\nWhat you are talking about is confirming a suspect through DNA.", "Yeah creepily there have been MANY cases of fertility doctors using their own sperm to inseminate clients. I'm sure by far the majority of doctors in this specialty are not doing anything inappropriate, but it's really disturbing how there's at least one instance of this being discovered a year. And it's never one time per doctor, it's dozens.", "Oooo so the timeline matches, too. OP, please update us about your results.", "Right. My point is if they were suspecting him, her hair would not be used. If her dad is wanted, his paranoia is in the wrong place.", "What I AM saying, and I don't think it needs translating is IF he is a criminal, he should be worried about other DNA sources. Her hair in the garbage is NOT how he would ever get caught.", "The most prolific ones have hundreds of biokids.", "But the familial DNA was still essential to catching GSK. Without the relatives DNA being used to lead to him, they would have never narrowed in on him. The direct DNA from DeAngelo was only useful because they had already used familial DNA to narrow in on him.", "You're right.  I think the underlying problem here is that her dad might be living in a cuckoo clock.", "But her DNA might be why it would occur to the authorities to suspect him. If it comes up as a close match, that wouldn\u2019t be evidence it was him, but it would be a good reason to look for actual evidence.", "Well we know OP is"]}
