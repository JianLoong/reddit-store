That you will (gently) correct him if he calls you Dad, and that if it continues, you will mostly be spending time with your son alone. \n\nBoundaries are needed here, and even though it seems mean to say, it's better to enforce them now while both kids are still young than try to appease your ex with this only to have a real clusterfuck of a situation to untangle when the kids are older.", "NTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t *want* him to call you dad, you *aren\u2019t* his dad, and on top of that, you don\u2019t seem to have the type of relationship with this child that would make it normal/appropriate/sensible for him to call you dad. You just aren\u2019t playing the role of \u201cdad\u201d in this kids life. Having him call you dad could confuse him and give him unrealistic expectations for what type of relationship he will have/does have with you.", "NTA \n\nI think a better solution would be for you to see your son alone from now on rather than visit with all of them. Go get a custody order in place.", "NTA. Poor kid, though.", "NTA You have a responsibility to parent your child. The older child has a dad somewhere. It might be a good idea for her to contact him and see if he is willing to parent his son.\n\nYou are not in a relationship with the mother. It would not be right to expect you to be a father to her other son. It isn't fair to the child to raise expectations. She needs to have a talk with her older son and explain that you are not his dad.\n\nWhy are you visiting and not having custody of your son on a schedule? You need a shared custody agreement. Pick your child up to spend parenting time. When you visit it seems like you are visiting the family not your son. It could cause confusion for the older son.\n\nIt might be better if you limit your contact. Do child exchanges quickly, do not socialize at these exchanges. Do not give false hope to the mother or the son. Don't be manipulated or made to feel guilty. Create boundaries and stick to them. You are not this woman's partner so her scenario from her past doesn't work.\n\nI feel sorry for the little boy, but this is on mom. The only ones responsible for this child are the ones who created him.

Kid is 4 and when I go to their home to pick up and drop off my son, his brother is always coming up to hang out with me. Kid loves me and I\u2019m always cool with him. We buy him birthday and holiday gifts. \n\nKids can never have enough loving and kind people in their lives. Sounds like you\u2019re doing the right thing in being kind to him and showing him love.

These are small children and this situation is going to mess her other up her other child,  who will likely take out his frustration, confusion and fear on your child.\n\nTo keep your son feeling safe and whole you need to sort this out, either by:\n\n 1. Taking your child into your home, away from a clearly unstable and manipulative mother who is putting these kids on a collision course; or,\n\n 2. Professional intervention who will help you have this conversation with your child's mother that you are not her orher child's father, and to help the mother manage this landmine of a relationship because she is clearly unable to manage this on her own. \n\nIf you don't step in now YWBTA because your son is in a bad situation that is only going to get worse.

This is heartbreaking, but you aren't his dad nor are you in a long-term relationship with his mother in which you would be a father figure. You have legal rights with your son, but all interactions with her elder son would be based on her whims. She could enter a committed relationship with someone who would be in a position to be a father figure; the boy's father could come back into his life; she could get really mad at you. There are so many things that could happen that would be devastating to the child if he had grown to think of you as his dad and something interrupted that, and that's not even factoring in the impact on you. Not to mention how confusing and hurtful it would be for him to see \"dad\" step up for his brother financially, but not for him. I feel terribly for the little boy, but I think the path you've chosen causes the least harm. She should have never put you in this position to have to make this decision.", "Nta but she is. Just because she wants this does not mean you have to be his dad. She should be grateful you are a good role model.  6 years old is old enough to explain you are not his dad. Not your responsibility. She screwed up by having a baby with a man that is not being a dad to his child.  You both screwed up by not practicing birth control. Still not your job to father another man's son unless you choose to take on the job. Stand your ground", "NTA\n\nAnd if she didn\u2019t want kids raised in these circumstances she should have been more careful about contraceptives.  (And yes, it takes two to get pregnant, but she could have insisted on using multiple forms of birth control to reduce the odds.) She\u2019s got two kids with two exes.  \n\nIf she wants her older child to have a better father figure she needs a different guy, not you OP.", "NTA he is not your child.  Time to see your son alone from now on.  Your ex is trying to put the responsibilty of fatherhood onto you, when this kid isn't your bio nor did you have a long term relationship with her.  Nip this in the bud now as her expectations will grow if it continues.", "NTA, however this was difficult for me to judge based on the limited info.  Do you feel she might try to press you for additional financial support if you take on the role of \"daddy\" to her older child? Is she hoping you'll take both boys for days at a time so she get's a free babysitter?\n\nOn the other hand, while that child is not your child, he is your son's brother and nothing will change that.  You're in a unique position to be a positive influence to him and that may have a huge benefit for your son in the long term.\n\nIf you do routinely spend time with both boys, please occasionally spend time with your son alone so he knows he's special to you as an individual.", "NTA.  His mother seems to have a habit of having children she's not married to.  Do things in the wrong order and get the wrong result.  Good that you're stepping up and being a father for your kid, but she can't, and shouldn't, put the older kid's feelings on you.

Your ex really needs to back off on the \"Dad\" thing.

What about when the kid grows up - your Ex would encourage him to expect you to be there for his extra-curriculars, games etc. What about school trips, college funds, vacations, holidays, birthday and Christmas gifts? \n\nYour Ex is forcing you into a parent role and setting up her other children to a lifetime of emotional and financial disappointment. It is best if you stop this now. \n\nAITA is full of parents and children who are navigating this exact mess. And this extends not just to the other parents but also extended families. What happens when your parents or siblings buy gifts for your child and your Ex insists that her child should be included too or guilt trips your child for having a caring family while his half brother is missing out on it. \n\nI see years of legal mess and therapy bills for both the kids and yourself. Have a stern talk with your Ex, if required with a lawyer present and make it clear to her that you are not responsible for her other kids, you do not want any emotional or financial responsibility for them.
