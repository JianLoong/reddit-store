You are at a point where you can change the course of a child's life.  Consider the name uncle.  Include him in your time with your son. Expecially if he is a good kid( not some brat). Maybe the name dad will grow on you.", "NTA, you\u2019re doing a great job as a dad, that other kids want to be your kids. What is wrong is that she\u2019s trying to manipulate you\u2026 yes, she wants what\u2019s best for her kids, but you have the right to define the relationship. Tell him to call you \u201cuncle ( your name here)\u201d, and reward him for it. This is just pure kindness, and your son will have a happy, loving, secure older brother.", "NTA  You are entitled to autonomy and do not have to accept labels.", "NTA. \n\nIf you let him call you dad you have to *be* a dad to him. Otherwise he\u2019s going to feel even more unequally treated compared with his brother. Don\u2019t let your ex manipulate you into a lifelong commitment you don\u2019t want to make.", "Yet another reason why you never date single moms. Ever. NTA for your feelings but soft YTA for putting yourself and her son in this position by dating a single mom.", "NTA. Get a lawyer. Establish custody. See your son separately.", "I don't know anything about this,  but from what I've read on here at some point won't he be responsible for child support, etc. if he keeps playing the dad role for the older son? I'm not going to assume that's her play,  but being on the hook for 12 years of expenses I wasn't planning on would sour any positive relationship with the boy if the mom was going to push for that, and would make me hesitant to feed that narrative.", "It depends on how long the kid was dependant on OP it's usually 5 years but anyone correct me if I'm wrong.", "In some places acting as a father can get you forced to pay child support even if there is no biological relation ifirc so it\u2019s could in fact negatively impact him", "NTA", "NTA you should be firm on no dad. But you could ask to be called Uncle (your name) if you\u2019re willing to be a loving adult in this boy\u2019s life?  But sounds like mom sees double treats and money if she foists the dad title on you. Not how it works!", "If you take on the title of \u201cdad\u201d next thing will be you have to pay child support. Thread very carefully.\n\nIf you ex didn\u2019t want her children to be treated equally, then she should have been more care to avoid a pregnancy, especially by a \u201cbrief relationship \u201c.  Did you get dna proof the kid is yours.\n\nNTA  don\u2019t take on a lifetime commitment of being a dad role to this child, you have no way of knowing what future commitments you will have", "NTA but maybe say how about you  call me Uncle instead? I feel like your ex is trying to manipulate you into being Dad so she can get support later. Stick to your boundaries.", "You could find yourself legally responsible for financing this other child if you take a parental role.", "NTA it seems to me that your ex is trying to secure the financial security of both her children by manipulating you into becoming a parental figure. If you give in, child support will follow for sure. You will be better off securing a convenient custody agreement for your child and stay away of any manipulation attempts.", "NTA\n\nShe's using the kid to make you pay for him, take him with you when you go out with your kid...\n\nAnd from what i read here you might be sued for child support for that kid.\n\nDon't forget to document your written refusal to have a relationship with that kid and every text she sends...\n\nAnyway, i saw many crazy things happening around the world and paying for another man's child was one (but the man signed the birth certificate as father and the DNA test was considered irelevant)... Making someone pay for a kid with whom he lived doesn't seem to be as much of a stretch.\n\nKeep telling her her older kid has a father, you're not responsible for him, the money you give her are only for your bio kid. And ask her to stop pushing her son to call you dad because you never bonded.\n\nMight seem harsh, unfair, but it might save you alot of trouble.\n\nAnd yes, the kid is innocent - but so are you.", "Why do people get into relationships with others with children if they don\u2019t want to act as a parental figure? You\u2019re the only father like figure the kid has, and he\u2019s known you at leeeast since he was 3!\n\nThis baffles me. SMH.\n\nYTA!!!!!", "Nta, and be careful with this precarious situation.", "Wait, fast forward to the day when OP's ex files for a child support order for the kid that calls him \"Daddy.\"", "I have never heard of this happening, other than on Internet message boards, and no one has ever verified the rumor. There needs to be a legal relationship between the child and the adult for a support obligation to accrue. If he adopted the child, then yes, support. If the mother seeks support for OP's child and spends part of that support on the other child, that is usually accepted by the courts as it's considered in the supported child's benefit to have their sibling well cared for also. But separate support of a child who isn't his when he was never married to the mother and never believed the child to be his, nor held himself out as the parent? Not going to happen.", "No. This varies from state to state, but there has never been a parent-child relationship between OP and his ex's son, there's never been an adoption, OP was never even married to the boy's mother. So he's not going to be on the hook for child support or anything else for the ex's child (although he will be required to support his own child). However, that doesn't mean his ex won't try to start pushing for/guilting him into providing financial support for her son. That's where this might be leading. But she won't be able to get a court order for support because there's no basis for it.", "There has never been a legal relationship between the ex's child and OP, so there's not going to be a basis for support. Even if OP lived with ex and the child, that wouldn't be sufficient to establish child support for a child who isn't his and who he hasn't adopted.", "NTA! NONONONONO! In the US, you can be held legally and financially responsible if you take on a fatherly role, if a judge decides that is what is best. Keep that boundary harder than diamond.", "NTA.  \nIt's amazing to me the amount of people that try to force a familial bond. Either it's there, or it isn't.   \nIt's not as if you're stopping her from treating her kids equally. What she wants is for you to treat her kids equally, even though one isn't yours. \nTell her flat out it makes you uncomfortable, and that if she insists, then you'll want to have alone time with your son.", "NTA, you weren't together long enough for that kind of a relationship to be established and she's got to be egging this on since it's so persistent.\n\nShe needs to stop this and explain to her son that you aren't his dad!", "NTA. Nip this in the bud right now. Explain to him that you are \u201cbrother\u2019s\u201d dad and not his. You do not want to cause confusion/hurt feelings when he gets older and sees the difference in care between him and brother. Then the question will be why did you give him hope that you will treat him like your bio son by letting him call you dad."]}
