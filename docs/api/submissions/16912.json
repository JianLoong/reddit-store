She lives a few states away and wants us to be able to fly to her in case something happens to her.

She allowed us to borrow some money and we paid it back fairly quickly with 5% interest.

I was very upset and sent him text messages exchanged between MIL and my husband.

That's a very well developed answer! 5 extra points!\"\n  \nI'll forget I have said these things, so I make it a point to write it down on their paper. I do this because I KNOW I'll forget.
