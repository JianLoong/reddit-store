This happened last week and I\u2019ve been torn over it since. I see lots of these posts on Facebook so I asked my grand niece to help me set this up. \n\nI\u2019m 64 and I have one son, Robert, with my late husband James. Robert is engaged to Sarah who is also 35. \n\nLast Sunday Sarah and Robert came to my house for dinner. We were chatting and I told them a story about James, who Sarah unfortunately never got to meet. \n\nWhile I was pregnant, James was very excited and insisted on putting together everything, cribs and changing tables etc. \n\nBless him, but my James was not much of a carpenter and one day when I was putting Robert in his crib, the whole thing broke! I managed to catch Robert in time so no harm done thankfully. \n\nAfter the story I made a joke along the lines of Sarah never having that problem if they have children, because Robert actually is a carpenter. \n\nShe burst into tears and asked me why I was being so cruel. I was taken aback and asked her what was wrong as I certainly hand t meant to upset her and I was sorry if I had. \n\nShe told me they discovered recently that Sarah is infertile and she would never be able to have children even with IVF. \n\nI apologized profusely and said if I had known I would never have made a joke about it. James and I struggled with having Robert and we\u2019re never able to give him siblings so I felt awful that I had hurt Sarah like that.  \n\nThe mood was ruined after that and Robert and Sarah decided to leave early. \n\nOn Tuesday, I ran into Roberts best friend and his wife while I was out shopping. His wife is good friends with Sarah and seemed unusually cold towards me. \n\nI asked why and she said she hadn\u2019t known I was so rude and that I should be ashamed of mocking Sarah\u2019s infertility. It turns out that the story has been spread that I viciously insulted Sarah and insinuated she shouldn\u2019t marry Robert! \n\nThe story even got back to our family and a lot of our relatives are quite upset with me. I apologized when I made the joke, but now I\u2019m wondering if I really did overstep that badly and insult Sarah horribly. I don\u2019t want to be a bad MIL and I get along quite well with Sarah ordinarily\n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1670779201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zj0ct2/aita_for_accidentally_insulting_my_future/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have you tried speaking to your son about this situation?", "You made a joke about your late husband's carpentry skills, not your daughter in law's infertility as you were completely unaware of their situation. \n\nThat Sarah has chosen to make you a villain to everyone who will listen says more about her than it does you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou had no idea about her infertility and that is not on you at all. From what I see here, you'd never, ever joke about something so serious, especially right to the person's face. \n\nThey're TA for spreading this around and making such a big deal out of it when you didn't know at all what was going on with her.", "NTA.  You did not accidentally insult your DIL.  You were referencing your son's capability as a carpenter.  If you had not been notified of DIL's infertility, how could you be insulting her?\n\nYou CANNOT insult someone about infertility if YOU DO NOT KNOW THEY ARE INFERTILE.\n\nYour son and DIL are the A H here, not only for taking false offense, AND for getting the whole family involved.", "NTA. You made an innocent joke that would have been fine if not for background information that you didn\u2019t know. Sarah was understandably upset as it is such a sensitive subject and she has only just found out. I would have said N.A.H, except that they have been spreading the story as if it was done on purpose and after you apologised. Perhaps with a bit of time they will realise that it wasn\u2019t malicious but they are only just coming to terms with their infertility.", "If the conversation went exactly as you describe  then NTA.\n\nHowever, the story your son and his fianc\u00e9e are sharing is so dramatically different from what you described, I think there is way more going on here.  It doesn\u2019t feel like a simple misunderstanding or people being overly sensitive.  You should call your son to get a better understanding of what is going on.", "NTA.  You had no idea at the time you told your joke that Sarah was infertile.  Your joke also poked fun at your late husband, not the concept of infertility.   Being infertile is unfortunate but it isn't a license to spread false and malicious rumors that you \"viciously insulted Sarah and insinuated she should marry Robert\".", "NTA\n\nIf they found out recently then she is still dealing with her emotions about it which can take awhile. You weren\u2019t told and had no idea and you immediately apologized.", "NTA hahaha you had no way of knowing, had no intended malice, and apologized profusely.\n\nIf I was Robert this would be a huge red flag for me.", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t be blamed for something that you didn\u2019t know. You shared a humorous family anecdote and had no idea that Sarah was struggling with just finding out that she was infertile.", "NTA. You had no idea she was infertile and your joke was about carpentry.", "NTA: You told an anecdote and tied it back to the people around you, and if the retelling is correct, you didn't say \"when\" but \"if.\"\n\nHowever, if they've only recently found out, their emotions will be quite raw. Give them time, space and only bring up the whole thing if they do. But perhaps check in with you son to see if his fiance is ok/see if there is anything you can do.", "100% NTA. You didn't know about her situation and you were not purposely talking about it. You were talking about your late husband.  I feel your future DIL is now playing a power move and telling everyone she can that you were being cruel when in reality it was lack of information regarding the topic of children. I got more of a Red Flag from your future DIL than anything else.", "NTA. You didn't know. Don't beat yourself up about it.\n\nHopefully they'll come round in time. But you weren't aware and so are not to blame.", "NTA\n\nHave you checked with Robert about the embellished story being passed around?", "NTA how could you have known she was infertile AND the story was about your late husband. I see no correlation between them other than they both involve babies. I'm guessing she recently found out and that's why it's a sensitive subject. She definitely flew off the handle bars in this situation however and it's definitely not your fault. If she continues acting like this and doesn't come to her senses soon I'd start being a bit worried about her mental health.", "NTA you didn\u2019t know about her infertility therefore you can\u2019t insult her about it. \n\nShe\u2019s obviously feeling very sensitive and repetition of the story has given it more legs which has caused it to run further and faster than the original conversation. \n\nI think it\u2019s worth speak to you son again in the first instance.", "Provided what you wrote is accurate, NTA. You didn't mock her. You didn't even act like it was assumed they would be having children.", "NTA  At worst you have a bad case of foot in mouth disease.  Most likely you just have extremely unlucky timing.  Continue to apologize and stress that you didn't know, don't have anything against her, etc.  She's going through a painful time so I wouldn't take it personally.", "NTA. You didn't know about the infertility issue, and your actual comments weren't out of line. You made it clear that if you'd known, that you wouldn't have made the remark.\nI struggled to conceive for nearly a decade, with no luck. I'm sure your future DIL is feeling all kinds of negative emotions relating to this- I know I did. Still, it's not okay to take out one's frustration on other people. Hopefully, at some point she realizes this and y'all can mend fences.", "That was a funny joke to me.\n\nYou didn\u2019t mock her infertility (that you had no idea about), you joked that their crib wouldn\u2019t fall apart if they have children because Robert is a carpenter. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know about Sarah\u2019s infertility and your joke was more of about your late husband than it was about Sarah and Robert having kids. I think that Sarah\u2019s distress over this issue has caused her to make you the face of this issue. You can\u2019t sit infertility down in a chair and yell at it for causing you so much pain so instead Sarah is lashing out at you. Sarah should be allowed to have as much time as she needs to process this distressing news but she has no right to lie on you and destroy your reputation. I would tell your son that he needs to tell the truth.", "NTA You can\u2019t mock something you don\u2019t know.", "NTA. You didn't know. Stand your ground and stick to your version of events.", "NTA \n\nYou made a joke, and Sarah took it way out of proportions because she was emotional. It sucks for her but if you didn\u2019t know how the hell is that your fault? \n\nAlso, maybe try talking to your son about the rumors. Just tell him what\u2019s going on. Hopefully he isn\u2019t okay with these lies being spread around.", "NTA. I just don't see how this is your fault because you apparently had no idea about her fertility struggles. Also you apologized profusely and the joke that you wrote here I just don't see how it's turned into what she's told everyone else. I'm sorry that this happened to you but based on what you wrote here it was just a terrible misunderstanding that you had no way of knowing would affect her the way it did. It seems really unfair that she's telling other people you attacked her and I hope you guys are able to work things out.", "Nta. \n\nYou had no way of knowing what was going on with them and your reaction upon learning the information showed that.", "NTA You didn't know she was infertile so your comment had nothing to do with her infertility, nor did you ever insult her. \n\n> It turns out that the story has been spread that I viciously insulted Sarah and insinuated she shouldn\u2019t marry Robert! \n\nIf what you said was bad, then it wouldn't need altered when telling other people. \n\n> Am I the asshole here?\n\nNo, but it sounds like you have a fat lie to clear up. You're not a bad MIL, but she is a bad DIL for spreading a lie.", "NTA you weren't even insulting her .........", "NTA. Why would they expect you to know that without telling you. They are being unreasonable.", "Good grief. You are not a mind reader!  I\u2019m sorry Sarah was upset but you are not at fault here. \n(I also think she\u2019s got bigger issues if she can\u2019t let this go and is blabbing to all and sundry)\nNTA", "I\u2019m kind of surprised that you even need to ask, but the answer is, no, you\u2019re absolutely NTA.", "Nta. You didn't know, your not psychic and it wasn't intended in malice", "NTA   If it went down the way you told it.   If it did happen this way then Robert is gettng in with a woman who is a liar and toxic irregardless of her inferility issues.\n\nI think you need to have a frank discussion with Robert and figure out how it got to this point and if it is repairable.", "Nta, she\u2019s just over dramatic. You didn\u2019t insult her or were cruel. You didn\u2019t even know. She is badmouthing you and needs to apologize", "NTA\n\nHere's the thing: the standard that's set by our society is that women can get pregnant. The fact that that's not always the case, be it because of genetics, illness, or personal choice does not change that unless one knows better one will expect that it's a possibility. Your son and his future wife clearly did so as well, since there isn't much point to testing one's fertility if one isn't actually trying to have a child and running into difficulties with that.\nIf you, as someone who clearly knows (as in you know that they are not child free by choice but rather plan to have children someday) your son and his future wife, talk about any future (grand) kids without any pressure about time lines or special expectations, you're not doing anything wrong.\n\nThere's nothing morally wrong or questionable about what you did.\n\nYou didn't purposefully hurt your future dil. You didn't even do anything that - at least in your mind and with the information you had at that given moment - had a more than negligible chance of hurting her. That explanation together with a promise to be careful in the future should have ended that conflict.\n\nThat your daughter in law blew the conflict out of proportion may very well be her showing her own insecurities. My guess is that she herself hasn't gotten over the shock of the diagnosis, is deeply unhappy as well as overwhelmed with her own expectations for herself and her life and that new reality - and your innocent joke hit just that still heavily bleeding wound and she lashed out. If it had stayed a conflict between you and her, I'd have chosen n a h because of that. But it didn't, did it? \n\nAfter your dinner she maybe tried to explain her reaction to this faux pas and made you into the bad guy in her mind because she couldn't stand to be it herself. Because in her mind she already is, simply because her body won't be able to do what she and our society expected from it. But she went a step further and engaged other people into this situation while misrepresenting the situation. That's lying. That's makes her the a h, her personal pain and grief notwithstanding.", "NAH. It seems like Sarah was in a very vulnerable and delicate state, and I could totally see her misunderstanding what you meant to emphasize in the story, especially considering how common it is to pressure women in her age group to have kids. According to your story, you were not being deliberately insensitive, and you didn\u2019t have all the information.\n\nI\u2019d also be curious if you or anyone else in Sarah\u2019s life, like if her parents or relatives have been putting pressure on her about kids purposely or not purposely. This could have been the metaphorical straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\nThe way you describe the events and your existing relationships, it doesn\u2019t seem like this is a typical situation.\n\nAs for the story going around, it\u2019s easy for these things to get out of hand. When someone\u2019s so vulnerable and upset about something so overwhelming, it\u2019s common to vent and lash out at safer, concrete things. \n\nShe\u2019s probably feeling a mix of shame, disappointment, guilt, anger, and all sorts of things. She probably also has internalized fear of rejection: you know how much women\u2019s value is tied to fertility. You have an opportunity to reach out and be a source of support. \n\nYou could write a letter or message apologizing and acknowledging her feelings, stating that you love her and are excited to have her as part of the family. That you wish you had not shared that specific story at that specific time, because although you meant it in one way, hindsight behind 20/20 after her reaction you realize how much it hurt. \n\nTell her how much you value your relationship with her, as well as her relationship with your son. Offer to talk/grab coffee/ do something together when she\u2019s ready, then give her space. Tell her you\u2019re here to support her.\n\nAvoid focusing too much on your own struggles with infertility, saying \u201cI know how you feel\u201d or giving advice, because that\u2019s often taken as patronizing.\n\nMany people on this subreddit have a very black and white view of these types of situations, but it sounds like you are two kind, reasonable people who are in a difficult situation. Some might say that Sarah is totally in the wrong and that you should be vindictive, but really, both of you are imperfect humans. As long as both of you are able to approach with kindness, I can see you moving forward together with a stronger relationship.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t know.\n\nWith that said it is very risky to mention/joke/suggest to anyone of childbearing age anything about having kids. So many people have suffered miscarriages, infertility, and other heartbreaks and you are inadvertently picking at the scab of their pain.\n\nYou didn\u2019t know. \n\nWe are in a different world now with people getting married and having kids 10 or 20 years later than they used to meaning struggles with fertility are more widespread.\n\nMaybe flowers, a card and a profuse apology will help smooth things over with future DIL.", "ESH\n\nIt is rude to voice any assumptions about a couple having children, infertility or not. \n\nThe story she\u2019s telling doesn\u2019t match what you said either. She needs therapy.", "ESH\nthey are wildly exaggerating \n\nI get yours was an innocent mistake but please, can we please all learn to avoid referring to \u201cfuture children\u201d or similar?\nIt\u2019s a topic that should be left alone, for several reasons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not sure why you are being painted as some sort of mother-in-law villain in this scenario.

You want the situation resolved and the harmony restored in your family. I would look for a way to express that you value your dil as an individual, invite them out to her favorite restaurant, send them her favorite flowers, something that shows you have been listening to her, and when they are ready you can reiterate that you did not know, and that you love them under all circumstances. Over time the situation will resolve itself if you continue on with love.\n\n\n And I only say all of this because I respect your interpretation of the situation, that this is like a game of telephone, and the DIL is not intentionally over dramatizing the story, but instead expressing her hurt and badly telling the story, and people are filling in the gaps with outrage.", "NTA.

A good friend once came to me about James having an affair- he went for coffee with his sister! \nI think going for lunch is a good idea.
