This happened last week and I\u2019ve been torn over it since. I see lots of these posts on Facebook so I asked my grand niece to help me set this up. \n\nI\u2019m 64 and I have one son, Robert, with my late husband James. Robert is engaged to Sarah who is also 35. \n\nLast Sunday Sarah and Robert came to my house for dinner. We were chatting and I told them a story about James, who Sarah unfortunately never got to meet. \n\nWhile I was pregnant, James was very excited and insisted on putting together everything, cribs and changing tables etc. \n\nBless him, but my James was not much of a carpenter and one day when I was putting Robert in his crib, the whole thing broke! I managed to catch Robert in time so no harm done thankfully. \n\nAfter the story I made a joke along the lines of Sarah never having that problem if they have children, because Robert actually is a carpenter. \n\nShe burst into tears and asked me why I was being so cruel. I was taken aback and asked her what was wrong as I certainly hand t meant to upset her and I was sorry if I had. \n\nShe told me they discovered recently that Sarah is infertile and she would never be able to have children even with IVF. \n\nI apologized profusely and said if I had known I would never have made a joke about it. James and I struggled with having Robert and we\u2019re never able to give him siblings so I felt awful that I had hurt Sarah like that.  \n\nThe mood was ruined after that and Robert and Sarah decided to leave early. \n\nOn Tuesday, I ran into Roberts best friend and his wife while I was out shopping. His wife is good friends with Sarah and seemed unusually cold towards me. \n\nI asked why and she said she hadn\u2019t known I was so rude and that I should be ashamed of mocking Sarah\u2019s infertility. It turns out that the story has been spread that I viciously insulted Sarah and insinuated she shouldn\u2019t marry Robert! \n\nThe story even got back to our family and a lot of our relatives are quite upset with me. I apologized when I made the joke, but now I\u2019m wondering if I really did overstep that badly and insult Sarah horribly. I don\u2019t want to be a bad MIL and I get along quite well with Sarah ordinarily\n\nAm I the asshole here?", "created_utc": 1670779201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zj0ct2/aita_for_accidentally_insulting_my_future/", "score": 490, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have you tried speaking to your son about this situation?", "You made a joke about your late husband's carpentry skills, not your daughter in law's infertility as you were completely unaware of their situation. \n\nThat Sarah has chosen to make you a villain to everyone who will listen says more about her than it does you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou had no idea about her infertility and that is not on you at all. From what I see here, you'd never, ever joke about something so serious, especially right to the person's face. \n\nThey're TA for spreading this around and making such a big deal out of it when you didn't know at all what was going on with her.", "NTA.  You did not accidentally insult your DIL.  You were referencing your son's capability as a carpenter.  If you had not been notified of DIL's infertility, how could you be insulting her?\n\nYou CANNOT insult someone about infertility if YOU DO NOT KNOW THEY ARE INFERTILE.\n\nYour son and DIL are the A H here, not only for taking false offense, AND for getting the whole family involved.", "NTA. You made an innocent joke that would have been fine if not for background information that you didn\u2019t know. Sarah was understandably upset as it is such a sensitive subject and she has only just found out. I would have said N.A.H, except that they have been spreading the story as if it was done on purpose and after you apologised. Perhaps with a bit of time they will realise that it wasn\u2019t malicious but they are only just coming to terms with their infertility.", "If the conversation went exactly as you describe  then NTA.\n\nHowever, the story your son and his fianc\u00e9e are sharing is so dramatically different from what you described, I think there is way more going on here.  It doesn\u2019t feel like a simple misunderstanding or people being overly sensitive.  You should call your son to get a better understanding of what is going on.", "NTA.  You had no idea at the time you told your joke that Sarah was infertile.  Your joke also poked fun at your late husband, not the concept of infertility.   Being infertile is unfortunate but it isn't a license to spread false and malicious rumors that you \"viciously insulted Sarah and insinuated she should marry Robert\".", "NTA\n\nIf they found out recently then she is still dealing with her emotions about it which can take awhile. You weren\u2019t told and had no idea and you immediately apologized.", "NTA hahaha you had no way of knowing, had no intended malice, and apologized profusely.\n\nIf I was Robert this would be a huge red flag for me.", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t be blamed for something that you didn\u2019t know. You shared a humorous family anecdote and had no idea that Sarah was struggling with just finding out that she was infertile.", "NTA. You had no idea she was infertile and your joke was about carpentry.", "NTA: You told an anecdote and tied it back to the people around you, and if the retelling is correct, you didn't say \"when\" but \"if.\"\n\nHowever, if they've only recently found out, their emotions will be quite raw. Give them time, space and only bring up the whole thing if they do. But perhaps check in with you son to see if his fiance is ok/see if there is anything you can do.", "100% NTA. You didn't know about her situation and you were not purposely talking about it. You were talking about your late husband.  I feel your future DIL is now playing a power move and telling everyone she can that you were being cruel when in reality it was lack of information regarding the topic of children. I got more of a Red Flag from your future DIL than anything else.", "NTA. You didn't know. Don't beat yourself up about it.\n\nHopefully they'll come round in time. But you weren't aware and so are not to blame.", "NTA\n\nHave you checked with Robert about the embellished story being passed around?", "NTA how could you have known she was infertile AND the story was about your late husband. I see no correlation between them other than they both involve babies. I'm guessing she recently found out and that's why it's a sensitive subject. She definitely flew off the handle bars in this situation however and it's definitely not your fault. If she continues acting like this and doesn't come to her senses soon I'd start being a bit worried about her mental health.", "NTA you didn\u2019t know about her infertility therefore you can\u2019t insult her about it. \n\nShe\u2019s obviously feeling very sensitive and repetition of the story has given it more legs which has caused it to run further and faster than the original conversation. \n\nI think it\u2019s worth speak to you son again in the first instance.", "Provided what you wrote is accurate, NTA. You didn't mock her. You didn't even act like it was assumed they would be having children.", "NTA  At worst you have a bad case of foot in mouth disease.  Most likely you just have extremely unlucky timing.  Continue to apologize and stress that you didn't know, don't have anything against her, etc.  She's going through a painful time so I wouldn't take it personally.", "NTA. You didn't know about the infertility issue, and your actual comments weren't out of line. You made it clear that if you'd known, that you wouldn't have made the remark.\nI struggled to conceive for nearly a decade, with no luck. I'm sure your future DIL is feeling all kinds of negative emotions relating to this- I know I did. Still, it's not okay to take out one's frustration on other people. Hopefully, at some point she realizes this and y'all can mend fences.", "That was a funny joke to me.\n\nYou didn\u2019t mock her infertility (that you had no idea about), you joked that their crib wouldn\u2019t fall apart if they have children because Robert is a carpenter. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know about Sarah\u2019s infertility and your joke was more of about your late husband than it was about Sarah and Robert having kids. I think that Sarah\u2019s distress over this issue has caused her to make you the face of this issue. You can\u2019t sit infertility down in a chair and yell at it for causing you so much pain so instead Sarah is lashing out at you. Sarah should be allowed to have as much time as she needs to process this distressing news but she has no right to lie on you and destroy your reputation. I would tell your son that he needs to tell the truth.", "NTA You can\u2019t mock something you don\u2019t know.", "NTA. You didn't know. Stand your ground and stick to your version of events.", "NTA \n\nYou made a joke, and Sarah took it way out of proportions because she was emotional. It sucks for her but if you didn\u2019t know how the hell is that your fault? \n\nAlso, maybe try talking to your son about the rumors. Just tell him what\u2019s going on. Hopefully he isn\u2019t okay with these lies being spread around.", "NTA. I just don't see how this is your fault because you apparently had no idea about her fertility struggles. Also you apologized profusely and the joke that you wrote here I just don't see how it's turned into what she's told everyone else. I'm sorry that this happened to you but based on what you wrote here it was just a terrible misunderstanding that you had no way of knowing would affect her the way it did. It seems really unfair that she's telling other people you attacked her and I hope you guys are able to work things out.", "Nta. \n\nYou had no way of knowing what was going on with them and your reaction upon learning the information showed that.", "NTA You didn't know she was infertile so your comment had nothing to do with her infertility, nor did you ever insult her. \n\n> It turns out that the story has been spread that I viciously insulted Sarah and insinuated she shouldn\u2019t marry Robert! \n\nIf what you said was bad, then it wouldn't need altered when telling other people. \n\n> Am I the asshole here?\n\nNo, but it sounds like you have a fat lie to clear up. You're not a bad MIL, but she is a bad DIL for spreading a lie.", "NTA you weren't even insulting her .........", "NTA. Why would they expect you to know that without telling you. They are being unreasonable.", "Good grief. You are not a mind reader!  I\u2019m sorry Sarah was upset but you are not at fault here. \n(I also think she\u2019s got bigger issues if she can\u2019t let this go and is blabbing to all and sundry)\nNTA", "I\u2019m kind of surprised that you even need to ask, but the answer is, no, you\u2019re absolutely NTA.", "Nta. You didn't know, your not psychic and it wasn't intended in malice", "NTA   If it went down the way you told it.   If it did happen this way then Robert is gettng in with a woman who is a liar and toxic irregardless of her inferility issues.\n\nI think you need to have a frank discussion with Robert and figure out how it got to this point and if it is repairable.", "Nta, she\u2019s just over dramatic. You didn\u2019t insult her or were cruel. You didn\u2019t even know. She is badmouthing you and needs to apologize", "NTA\n\nHere's the thing: the standard that's set by our society is that women can get pregnant. The fact that that's not always the case, be it because of genetics, illness, or personal choice does not change that unless one knows better one will expect that it's a possibility. Your son and his future wife clearly did so as well, since there isn't much point to testing one's fertility if one isn't actually trying to have a child and running into difficulties with that.\nIf you, as someone who clearly knows (as in you know that they are not child free by choice but rather plan to have children someday) your son and his future wife, talk about any future (grand) kids without any pressure about time lines or special expectations, you're not doing anything wrong.\n\nThere's nothing morally wrong or questionable about what you did.\n\nYou didn't purposefully hurt your future dil. You didn't even do anything that - at least in your mind and with the information you had at that given moment - had a more than negligible chance of hurting her. That explanation together with a promise to be careful in the future should have ended that conflict.\n\nThat your daughter in law blew the conflict out of proportion may very well be her showing her own insecurities. My guess is that she herself hasn't gotten over the shock of the diagnosis, is deeply unhappy as well as overwhelmed with her own expectations for herself and her life and that new reality - and your innocent joke hit just that still heavily bleeding wound and she lashed out. If it had stayed a conflict between you and her, I'd have chosen n a h because of that. But it didn't, did it? \n\nAfter your dinner she maybe tried to explain her reaction to this faux pas and made you into the bad guy in her mind because she couldn't stand to be it herself. Because in her mind she already is, simply because her body won't be able to do what she and our society expected from it. But she went a step further and engaged other people into this situation while misrepresenting the situation. That's lying. That's makes her the a h, her personal pain and grief notwithstanding.", "NAH. It seems like Sarah was in a very vulnerable and delicate state, and I could totally see her misunderstanding what you meant to emphasize in the story, especially considering how common it is to pressure women in her age group to have kids. According to your story, you were not being deliberately insensitive, and you didn\u2019t have all the information.\n\nI\u2019d also be curious if you or anyone else in Sarah\u2019s life, like if her parents or relatives have been putting pressure on her about kids purposely or not purposely. This could have been the metaphorical straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\nThe way you describe the events and your existing relationships, it doesn\u2019t seem like this is a typical situation.\n\nAs for the story going around, it\u2019s easy for these things to get out of hand. When someone\u2019s so vulnerable and upset about something so overwhelming, it\u2019s common to vent and lash out at safer, concrete things. \n\nShe\u2019s probably feeling a mix of shame, disappointment, guilt, anger, and all sorts of things. She probably also has internalized fear of rejection: you know how much women\u2019s value is tied to fertility. You have an opportunity to reach out and be a source of support. \n\nYou could write a letter or message apologizing and acknowledging her feelings, stating that you love her and are excited to have her as part of the family. That you wish you had not shared that specific story at that specific time, because although you meant it in one way, hindsight behind 20/20 after her reaction you realize how much it hurt. \n\nTell her how much you value your relationship with her, as well as her relationship with your son. Offer to talk/grab coffee/ do something together when she\u2019s ready, then give her space. Tell her you\u2019re here to support her.\n\nAvoid focusing too much on your own struggles with infertility, saying \u201cI know how you feel\u201d or giving advice, because that\u2019s often taken as patronizing.\n\nMany people on this subreddit have a very black and white view of these types of situations, but it sounds like you are two kind, reasonable people who are in a difficult situation. Some might say that Sarah is totally in the wrong and that you should be vindictive, but really, both of you are imperfect humans. As long as both of you are able to approach with kindness, I can see you moving forward together with a stronger relationship.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t know.\n\nWith that said it is very risky to mention/joke/suggest to anyone of childbearing age anything about having kids. So many people have suffered miscarriages, infertility, and other heartbreaks and you are inadvertently picking at the scab of their pain.\n\nYou didn\u2019t know. \n\nWe are in a different world now with people getting married and having kids 10 or 20 years later than they used to meaning struggles with fertility are more widespread.\n\nMaybe flowers, a card and a profuse apology will help smooth things over with future DIL.", "ESH\n\nIt is rude to voice any assumptions about a couple having children, infertility or not. \n\nThe story she\u2019s telling doesn\u2019t match what you said either. She needs therapy.", "ESH\nthey are wildly exaggerating \n\nI get yours was an innocent mistake but please, can we please all learn to avoid referring to \u201cfuture children\u201d or similar?\nIt\u2019s a topic that should be left alone, for several reasons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not sure why you are being painted as some sort of mother-in-law villain in this scenario.

You want the situation resolved and the harmony restored in your family. I would look for a way to express that you value your dil as an individual, invite them out to her favorite restaurant, send them her favorite flowers, something that shows you have been listening to her, and when they are ready you can reiterate that you did not know, and that you love them under all circumstances. Over time the situation will resolve itself if you continue on with love.\n\n\n And I only say all of this because I respect your interpretation of the situation, that this is like a game of telephone, and the DIL is not intentionally over dramatizing the story, but instead expressing her hurt and badly telling the story, and people are filling in the gaps with outrage.", "NTA.

A good friend once came to me about James having an affair- he went for coffee with his sister! \nI think going for lunch is a good idea.

So I\u2019m not judging because I feel like something is missing.", "NTA. As someone with fertility issues I\u2019m honestly a little embarrassed that your DIL put that on you. I realize everyone deals with these things in their own way, but you had absolutely no way of knowing, and furthermore, on a personal note, were I in this situation, I\u2019m not even sure I\u2019d bring up the fertility thing in the first place at that time because it would come across as needlessly passive aggressive. I\u2019d simply chuckle at the joke and move along like a normal human being. Please don\u2019t let this eat at you, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA", "NTA, it was a cute and funny story, and you had no way of knowing. \n\nIf you knew she was infertile you would be an enormous enormous AH. But if everything went down as it\u2019s written here you are innocent", "NTA. You weren't making a joke about her infertility, but about your late husband's lack of carpentry skills vs your son's ability. \n\nI can see how future DIL could have taken it as a dig at her (hearing it as \"won't be a problem for you because you can't have kids!\"), but only because I'm sure it was already weighing heavily on her mind. Of course you didn't say that at all, and didn't know about her infertility in the first place, so you're NTA regardless. \n\nI'm sorry the messed up game of telephone is getting so out of hand. Maybe try reaching out to apologize again now that she's had some time to process, and reiterate you had no idea and didn't mean anything by it. Hopefully once emotions aren't running so high, she'll understand and clear up the miscommunication with family!", "NTA. You had no idea and even apologized right away and clearly felt horrible. While I can see how children is a touchy subject for hee, she shouldve shown you some grace and realized it was a mistake.", "NTA. IF you had KNOWN she had received news she was infertile then I could see how you could be perceived as cruel for the comment. You didn\u2019t know though, and I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t have some history of being known as a mind reader. \n\nIt sounds like you are being made into a villain very unfairly, not to mention other misinformation is being spread as well. The latter I think you would have every right to be angry about. Nothing worse than people putting words into your mouth with the added insult of spreading around that narrative to everyone within earshot. \n\nYour DIL is going to probably need to get some therapy to overcome her feelings about her infertility. Part of that therapy is going to involve her having to come to terms with the fact that other people around her are still going to mention babies, post about babies on social media, or have babies themselves etc. There will be plenty of triggers and she will have to find a way to overcome them. The rest of the world still moves on even if her world feels at a standstill. Now that you know the situation you can do your best to help her through things and be sensitive. You had no way of knowing before this incident though so imo there\u2019s nothing to feel guilty about. \n\nBest of luck, you are likely in for a rough road ahead while she grieves and works through emotions.", "NTA", "NTA. You unknowingly hit a very sensitive nerve. Sarah will hopefully realize you weren\u2019t mocking her", "NTA.  You had no way of knowing.  You should continue to make efforts to patch things up with them as a couple personally.  Hopefully the game of \u201ctelephone\u201d will settle down.", "Sarah sounds unhinged. Very.\n\nNTA", "You may need to ask your son why people think you insinuated they shouldn't get married.

The  joke was about carpentry... not getting pregnant.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t know.", "NTA. How were you to know that she \"**RECENTLY**\" found out she has fertility issues? Are you a mind reader or have a crystal ball? Gehtdafukouttahere with that BS! That story had absolutely nothing to do with fertility FFS! You were talking about carpentry. It is just amazing how some people will turn any conversation into a discussion about their problems. Just let it go because some people just never out grow their need to be overly dramatic.\n\nETA: you didn't insult her fertility, you insulted your deceased husband's carpentry skills. That woman needs therapy.", "NTA, but I think it\u2019s important to note here that bringing up future children is generally inappropriate. I\u2019m a 30 year old woman and people do bring it up innocently, not meaning any harm, but it truly feels irritating. It creates a sense of pressure, and it\u2019s really none of anybody else\u2019s business. I think you should reach out to them and let her know you understand this topic is off limits, and that you won\u2019t bring it up again.", "NTA- are you supposed to be psychic now?

You had no reason to know about it. And you apologized on the spot. It\u2019s a pretty reasonable joke to make given the circumstances known to you at the time.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t know she had fertility issues. There was no malicious intent with what you said. \n\nSarah likely needs to go to therapy to learn how to deal with her emotions surrounding her infertility diagnosis. It sounds like she\u2019s projecting her anger on you in an unhealthy coping mechanism. Now, I wouldn\u2019t go and say that to them\u2014 hopefully they come to that answer in time. \n\nRule of thumb, never bring up the topic of children with anyone. \n\nI\u2019d probably send her flowers with an apology note. Even if you were not aware, you can apologize for bringing up the topic and the feelings it brought up. \n\nBest of luck to you.", "NTA, if things really went as you told here then you're not the asshole. They might be very sensitive right now because they just found out and emotions are flying high.\n\nMy advice would be to invite them both and have another talk about this.", "Nta. You obviously didn't insult Sarah, but she is fanning an untrue story about you and is insulting you.", "NTA - u didn\u2019t make a joke about her infertility! U didn\u2019t even know she was infertile! So how were u rude? \n\nShe is rude for acting like u came after her fertility", "Sarah is being an AH, you didn\u2019t know about the infertility, the fact that she is gossiping to everyone about you makes it so much worse, you are in no way the AH here.", "NTA! Whoa! Not only are you NTA, you need to have a serious talk with your son about her behavior. This is a huge red flag and may be indicative of how she is going to treat you in the marriage.", "NTA. It's a joke that didn't land, and how can you avoid a sensitive subject if you don't know?", "NTA.\n\nYou can't mock something you don't know about.\n\nOn the other hand, why would future DIL do this?\n\nAre you contributing financially to the wedding?  She is smearing your name. You need a public apology, and you may have the leverage to get it.\n\nIf your post is accurate, you seem sweet and kind, and I don't think you'll do the above, but figure out how to keep your good name.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know so how could it possibly be seen as cruel? \n\nIt was a sweet story that should in fact have made her happy that you saw her completely as family as you were prepared for them to potentially have kids. \n\nIt was never cruel. And though I do understand how she could be sensitive on the subject she Completely over reacted. \n\nShe\u2019s the one who owes you an apology.", "NTA. If you truly didn\u2019t know about her infertility then the story they are spreading is the only rude and cruel thing here.", "NTA. Sarah is a gossip. She should\u2019ve taken your apology seriously. I get how horrible infertility is\u2026trust me. But it doesn\u2019t give women license to be absolutely horrible to everyone around them any time they say something baby adjacent.", "NTA\nYou literally had no idea", "NTA.  It must have been very raw subject for Sarah, but the smearing of your name with friends and family isn't right.  You need to have a meeting with Robert and Sarah.  Again, tell them that the discussion about babies was made by you without the knowledge of Sarah's infertility and you meant no harm and you did apologize.  You have been told that you have viciously attacked Sarah about her infertility and friends and family are actually shunning you.  Tell them that if this is really what they intended to be your 'punishment,' you really don't want to be associated with them anymore. Sarah's actions have been mean and cruel.  I don't even know how she can fix the damage she has done to your reputation.", "NTA you were telling a story about your late husband and it had nothing to do with her. Bless your heart ma'am cause you most certainly did nothing wrong at all.", "Nta. I\u2019m sorry. That sucks, but she won\u2019t get away with it.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t know that she has infertility problems, besides, the joke wasn\u2019t about that, it was about carpentry. Also, they\u2019re the ones jumping to conclusions, infertility is tough and all, but they still can adopt, why people tend to forget that adoption is an option? Robert still can use his abilities as a carpenter to do a nursery or a crib, or whatever if they adopt. They can still have kids that way.", "NTA, but your DIL is for how she got butt hurt. I struggled with infertility too and she is acting out her pain on you. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to suffer for pain which you didn\u2019t cause. Seems to me like you\u2019re the easiest person to make the bad guy", "Oh god, NTA. At least if your version of the story is what happened, this is a pretty easy accident to make. Your comment had nothing to do with her infertility, and rested on a fair assumption, which is that your son and future DIL MIGHT plan to have children at some point. (I say this as a married person who intends to remain child free, but most of the time couples are capable of having children and choose to do so.) It was purely hypothetical and you were just making fun of your husband's poor carpentry skills. I understand your DIL's reaction in the moment but to continue to be upset about it is a gross overreaction, and made worse by the fact that she seems to be spreading a vicious rumor about it.", "NTA\n\nYou son is though. Sarah of course is being really insufferable. But your son didnt inform you and his negligence is leading to your ostrisization. And that he isn't stepping up to bat for you is salt onto the wound.\n\nI think a talk between you 3 woukd be good. And then maybe a family group chat explaining everything. And an apology from both Sarah n Robert", "NTA. You didn't say anything remotely wrong and Sarah is ridiculous. Given how unreasonable she is I think eventual estrangement was inevitable.", "NTA\n\nYou seem like a very kind person.\n\nYour story was totally appropriate. You had no idea that they were going through that. Sarah is allowed to be upset, I\u2019m sure that was distressing news for her. But it was clearly an accident and you never said anything about not marrying Robert. It\u2019s pretty disingenuous of Sarah to tell people you maliciously attacked her, when it seems clear she should have known it was an accident.\n\nLet yourself off the hook, these things happen and you really didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. Is everyone in your family crazy? What about your son? How could you have known. This is terrible.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't insult Sarah, you were teasing your late husband's lack of carpentry skills. She needs to realize that.", "There is a huge chasm between what you think you said, what your future daughter in law thinks you said and what other people think you said.  \n\nWhat does your son think you said?", "NTA, you're not a mind reader and didn't know about her issues so Sarah is definetly overreacting and I don't know what Sarah's been telling the rest of the family but clearly it's not the whole truth, your joke was about your late husband's skills and nothing else", "NTA - you immediately apologized and you were being malicious on purpose", "NTA but apologies are definitely in order. You didn't know, but it did hurt her badly. Maybe a small gift? Idk I'm not really good with this sort of thing", "NTA!!! You had no idea and everyone around you is being cruel and immature", "NTA\n\nYou told a cute story not knowing vital information and Sarah spun it as an attack.", "NTA.  You can't be blamed for insulting/making fun of something you didn't even know about.  Besides, you were joking about James' lack of carpentry skills, not Robert and Sarah's infertility.  If just the mention of children makes Sarah feel insulted, she really needs some therapy to get through the bad news she has received.", "NTA and they already have a baby - Sarah, who can\u2019t stop crying to whoever will listen and totally blow out and miss appropriate a misunderstanding into such a clusterfuck deserves an Oscar.", "Not the asshole. How could you possibly have known about this situation?  Your son and daughter in law are acting childish and lashing out. Unfortunately it\u2019s directed to you. You\u2019ve apologized, they need to grow up. There are millions of babies who need good homes. If they are mature enough to handle it, they should look into it. YOU deserve an apology.", "NTA and I hope you clearly explain this to everyone. Sarah sounds like she was looking for a reason to alienate you from your son. Get out in front of that. Sarah is no good.", "NTA, but I hope Robert is not aware of this and that he stops it once he is made aware.", "NTA", "NTA. You did not know. I would have made the same joke", "You know usually I read these titles and I wanna go you\u2019re probably the ass but in this case you\u2019re by no means an asshole. Infertility sucks but you had no idea you didn\u2019t say it even about having children just that your past husband is a bad builder. I recommend your dil get some therapy with your son to get over or better handle the emotions that come with this type of news instead of lashing out at everyone who makes jokes. If it makes you feel any better I\u2019d be satan in her eyes. I make jokes all the time about me having endo and a few miscarriages before having my babies!", "Sarah is a snake. NTA. Your son was there though? He heard your story, and knew what you said? Because this should be a huge red flag for him.", "ES\n\nThat 'story' about your husband , while cute' , was probing into the 'when am I going to have grandchildren' territory.  DIL is 35+ and fertility is an issue. \n\nAll baby territory should be taboo unless the people in question introduce the topic.\n\nDIL went a bit wobbly and took the story out of context because she felt under attack and vulerable.", "NTA - but this is why MIL\u2019s should never comment on babies - wanted, waiting, anything about possible future babies.", "Op didn\u2019t even say \u201cwhen you have children\u201d. She said \u201cif\u201d. \n\nSarah sounds insufferable.\n\nI never wanted kids, and it annoys me when people say \u201cwhen\u201d like it\u2019s some kind of given EVERYONE will have kids. So I could see someone who wants kids but can\u2019t have them getting upset about that. But even if that was the case - Sarah would be overreacting.", "Sarah needs stories for @JustNoMil. \n\nOp, NTA", "NTA\n\nI agree.\n\nOP apologized, she should probably talk to her son to see what's going on. And she might be willing to let this go if Sarah comes to her senses, sometimes people who are traumatized by recent bad news truly hear something different to what was said because they project THEIR fears and judgment of themselves on to others.\n\n\nI would also suggest she she shows him this post and gives her version to the family. Empathy does not involve letting yourself be the villain so someone else can play the victim.", "yeah,sarahs really reaching here..", "Not only that, but OP said \u201c*if* you have children.\u201d \n\nSo she was telling a funny anecdote from Sarah\u2019s future husbands childhood and didn\u2019t assume they *would* have kids. \n\nNot only that, but there\u2019s more than one way to become parents. So there could still be cribs in their future. Even if the news is too raw to process that now.", "Agreed. NTA if it went down like this.\n\nHowever, now that OP does know, OP could reach out & apologize again. OP culd try to explain their side of things now that folks are hopefully a little calmer. OP could also plainly say something along the lines that you would be happy with adopted grandchildren, or no grandchildren at all, as long as your son is happy. While it may not be OP's responsibility to apologize again, OP could.", "James was certainly a character! I have lots of good stories to tell about him. \nI think a nice lunch or dinner out with Sarah might help to clear everything up because the poor woman has a lot going on without all this too. She\u2019s ordinarily very sweet but I can definitely understand how the story could have gotten twisted. When they got engaged I was terrified of turning into my own mother in law, who to quote one of my grandnieces favorite movies, was a \u201cheinous bitch\u201d, pardon my French. I think that has probably added to my feelings about the whole situation but I feel a lot more clarity after reading all these lovely comments.", "I agree with you!  We had problems getting pregnant and were very lucky to be successful.  MILs talking about future grandbabies like it\u2019s a given fact make me crazy.  Some couples just cannot conceive and people can be so nosy and pushy.  When you\u2019re in the thick of infertility treatments none of it is funny.", "I think they only found out very recently, so I believe it\u2019s a case of feeling very raw about the whole infertility thing. James and I struggled to conceive Robert for years and afterwards we never managed again. I felt horrible about it, especially since my mother in law was very clear about who she blamed. \nSarah is quite a lovely woman so I really do hope this is just a case of Telephone", "How is that what you got from \n\n\u2018If you ever have kids, the crib won\u2019t break cause your husband is a carpenter\u2019 \n\nShe actually never mentioned Sarah being pregnant, so even if she was a bit off base for joking abt *children* in general, she was not assuming Sarah\u2019s life trajectory or pressuring pregnancy. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to insult somebody for something you don\u2019t know about, it can happen but more often than not it\u2019s due to the other person being overly sensitive about that particular subject and assuming the comment is a personal attack. That\u2019s what happened here.\n\nAt absolute best, it\u2019s ESH bc Sarah and hubby are walking around town talking shit. Be mad and take time apart from OP all you want, but you immediately lose your upper hand the second you start spreading fake stories and trying to paint OP as evil.\n\nI feel immensely for sarah and Robert, but no amount of personal pain makes it okay to lash out at others. I hope they get the help they need and can move forward with whatever their view of family is.", "Sarah sounds like she\u2019s struggling with difficult news and is being extra sensitive here. She\u2019s wrong, but come on. People fuck up after getting devastating news. It\u2019s likely this isn\u2019t even about the OP, and it\u2019s her way of grieving or having somewhere to focus her anger.

Mostly to me, as all of James siblings had big families so she believed I was at fault for us only having the one child.

They KNOW you had NO idea\u2026they only RECENTLY found this out themselves, how could you know?

Not an apology gift per se but more like an I\u2019m sorry life dealt you this shitty gut punch gift. Writing your thoughts down gives you a chance to compose them in a way that is coherent and makes sense so hopefully she understands and won\u2019t get super mad. Write it out a few times even before you put the final version in the card. \n\nAlso, NTA. I just think her feelings are raw like an open wound and anything about having kids would\u2019ve been a catalyst to upset her in that moment.

And she wouldn't even have had to lie maliciously.\nSometimes one fears and blames and hates oneself so much that one can't deal and can't move on. Then even an innocent remark from anyone else can not be taken in any other way than as a confirmation of ones own repressed fears and thoughts. One has created a self-fulfilling prophecy and the mind *will* uphold it. Because otherwise one would have to fight an internal battle and accept that the only \"villain\" to overcome is oneself.\nIt's fight or flight - and accepting that your joke was innocent, that what she heard were only her own fears spiralling out of control and that you're not the enemy that is hurting her so badly would mean accepting that you and other peoples opinions are not what she is fleeing from right now. \n\nSadly that would also mean that every bad thing she told or alluded to when talking about the incident is something she told herself beforehand.\n\nThe diagnosis surely was traumatic for her and I hope that she'll be able to receive and accept help for that. It may be prudent to contact a professional.", "Language is powerful. Women (and men) are pressured about having children (typically pregnancy) during many life stages.  OP addressed her comment to Sarah; not hubby or both.  When OP paralleled her life story (crib building and an infant) to Sarah's life it was funny to her and painful to Sarah. OP asked to be judged on her behavior: AITA for accidentally insulting my future daughter in laws fertility? This is a single act that was judged; not the the collective behaviors that followed. \n\nI appreciate your message. \"Its hard to insult someone for something you don't know...\". Yes, I agree. If you don't know, don't bring it up. Discussing 'children/pregnancy' is to be brought up by the person (DIL/son not MIL).
