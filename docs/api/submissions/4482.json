This happened last week and I\u2019ve been torn over it since. I see lots of these posts on Facebook so I asked my grand niece to help me set this up. \n\nI\u2019m 64 and I have one son, Robert, with my late husband James. Robert is engaged to Sarah who is also 35. \n\nLast Sunday Sarah and Robert came to my house for dinner. We were chatting and I told them a story about James, who Sarah unfortunately never got to meet. \n\nWhile I was pregnant, James was very excited and insisted on putting together everything, cribs and changing tables etc. \n\nBless him, but my James was not much of a carpenter and one day when I was putting Robert in his crib, the whole thing broke! I managed to catch Robert in time so no harm done thankfully. \n\nAfter the story I made a joke along the lines of Sarah never having that problem if they have children, because Robert actually is a carpenter. \n\nShe burst into tears and asked me why I was being so cruel. I was taken aback and asked her what was wrong as I certainly hand t meant to upset her and I was sorry if I had. \n\nShe told me they discovered recently that Sarah is infertile and she would never be able to have children even with IVF. \n\nI apologized profusely and said if I had known I would never have made a joke about it. James and I struggled with having Robert and we\u2019re never able to give him siblings so I felt awful that I had hurt Sarah like that.  \n\nThe mood was ruined after that and Robert and Sarah decided to leave early. \n\nOn Tuesday, I ran into Roberts best friend and his wife while I was out shopping. His wife is good friends with Sarah and seemed unusually cold towards me. \n\nI asked why and she said she hadn\u2019t known I was so rude and that I should be ashamed of mocking Sarah\u2019s infertility. It turns out that the story has been spread that I viciously insulted Sarah and insinuated she shouldn\u2019t marry Robert! \n\nThe story even got back to our family and a lot of our relatives are quite upset with me. I apologized when I made the joke, but now I\u2019m wondering if I really did overstep that badly and insult Sarah horribly. I don\u2019t want to be a bad MIL and I get along quite well with Sarah ordinarily\n\nAm I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: I decided to edit this and answer some questions! \n\n1. I haven\u2019t spoken to Tobert about the story spreading the way it did. I thought it was best to give them space after the dinner to process Sarah\u2019s diagnosis but a lot of commenters are saying I should ask him about it and I think you may be right. \n\n2. I haven\u2019t discussed future children with the before as my own MIL was quite cruel to myself and James, especially me, since we only had Robert. James\u2019s siblings all have quite large families and until she sided my MIL was very clear about who she blamed for our lack of children. I decided early on in Sarah and Roberts relationship that I wouldn\u2019t ask the typical questions of when they would have children but I have only met Sarah\u2019s family once so I don\u2019t know if her own relatives pressure her the way my MiL pressured me. \n\n3. Sarah is a very lovely woman and we have never had a big problem together before. Many commenters have said frankly rude things about her which wasn\u2019t my intention when posting here. I know Robert has always wanted a big family and he wouldn\u2019t have asked Sarah to marry him if they weren\u2019t in the same page about that, so Sarah is likely going through an enormous  amount of grief at the moment. Do be kind to her please \n\n4. I\u2019ve also decided to reach out to Sarah and ask if the two of us can talk. I think the story spreading was really a case of Telephone but I would like to clear the air . Following that I\u2019m going to ask the both of them over for a chat and discuss the situation as I don\u2019t want this to fester. I haven\u2019t decided what I\u2019m going to do about clearing everything up with the family but it\u2019s not my main concern, Robert and Sarah are. \n\n5. I would like to thank everyone for their comments, as they were mostly all lovely and kind. The situation truly upset me and a lot of you had very good advice so thank you all.", "created_utc": 1670779201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zj0ct2/aita_for_accidentally_insulting_my_future/", "score": 7107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have you tried speaking to your son about this situation?", "You made a joke about your late husband's carpentry skills, not your daughter in law's infertility as you were completely unaware of their situation. \n\nThat Sarah has chosen to make you a villain to everyone who will listen says more about her than it does you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou had no idea about her infertility and that is not on you at all. From what I see here, you'd never, ever joke about something so serious, especially right to the person's face. \n\nThey're TA for spreading this around and making such a big deal out of it when you didn't know at all what was going on with her.", "NTA.  You did not accidentally insult your DIL.  You were referencing your son's capability as a carpenter.  If you had not been notified of DIL's infertility, how could you be insulting her?\n\nYou CANNOT insult someone about infertility if YOU DO NOT KNOW THEY ARE INFERTILE.\n\nYour son and DIL are the A H here, not only for taking false offense, AND for getting the whole family involved.", "NTA. You made an innocent joke that would have been fine if not for background information that you didn\u2019t know. Sarah was understandably upset as it is such a sensitive subject and she has only just found out. I would have said N.A.H, except that they have been spreading the story as if it was done on purpose and after you apologised. Perhaps with a bit of time they will realise that it wasn\u2019t malicious but they are only just coming to terms with their infertility.", "If the conversation went exactly as you describe  then NTA.\n\nHowever, the story your son and his fianc\u00e9e are sharing is so dramatically different from what you described, I think there is way more going on here.  It doesn\u2019t feel like a simple misunderstanding or people being overly sensitive.  You should call your son to get a better understanding of what is going on.", "NTA.  You had no idea at the time you told your joke that Sarah was infertile.  Your joke also poked fun at your late husband, not the concept of infertility.   Being infertile is unfortunate but it isn't a license to spread false and malicious rumors that you \"viciously insulted Sarah and insinuated she shouldn't marry Robert\".", "NTA\n\nIf they found out recently then she is still dealing with her emotions about it which can take awhile. You weren\u2019t told and had no idea and you immediately apologized.", "NTA hahaha you had no way of knowing, had no intended malice, and apologized profusely.\n\nIf I was Robert this would be a huge red flag for me.", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t be blamed for something that you didn\u2019t know. You shared a humorous family anecdote and had no idea that Sarah was struggling with just finding out that she was infertile.", "NTA. You had no idea she was infertile and your joke was about carpentry.", "NTA: You told an anecdote and tied it back to the people around you, and if the retelling is correct, you didn't say \"when\" but \"if.\"\n\nHowever, if they've only recently found out, their emotions will be quite raw. Give them time, space and only bring up the whole thing if they do. But perhaps check in with you son to see if his fiance is ok/see if there is anything you can do.", "100% NTA. You didn't know about her situation and you were not purposely talking about it. You were talking about your late husband.  I feel your future DIL is now playing a power move and telling everyone she can that you were being cruel when in reality it was lack of information regarding the topic of children. I got more of a Red Flag from your future DIL than anything else.", "NTA. You didn't know. Don't beat yourself up about it.\n\nHopefully they'll come round in time. But you weren't aware and so are not to blame.", "NTA\n\nHave you checked with Robert about the embellished story being passed around?", "NTA how could you have known she was infertile AND the story was about your late husband. I see no correlation between them other than they both involve babies. I'm guessing she recently found out and that's why it's a sensitive subject. She definitely flew off the handle bars in this situation however and it's definitely not your fault. If she continues acting like this and doesn't come to her senses soon I'd start being a bit worried about her mental health.", "NTA you didn\u2019t know about her infertility therefore you can\u2019t insult her about it. \n\nShe\u2019s obviously feeling very sensitive and repetition of the story has given it more legs which has caused it to run further and faster than the original conversation. \n\nI think it\u2019s worth speak to you son again in the first instance.", "Provided what you wrote is accurate, NTA. You didn't mock her. You didn't even act like it was assumed they would be having children.", "NTA  At worst you have a bad case of foot in mouth disease.  Most likely you just have extremely unlucky timing.  Continue to apologize and stress that you didn't know, don't have anything against her, etc.  She's going through a painful time so I wouldn't take it personally.", "NTA. You didn't know about the infertility issue, and your actual comments weren't out of line. You made it clear that if you'd known, that you wouldn't have made the remark.\nI struggled to conceive for nearly a decade, with no luck. I'm sure your future DIL is feeling all kinds of negative emotions relating to this- I know I did. Still, it's not okay to take out one's frustration on other people. Hopefully, at some point she realizes this and y'all can mend fences.", "That was a funny joke to me.\n\nYou didn\u2019t mock her infertility (that you had no idea about), you joked that their crib wouldn\u2019t fall apart if they have children because Robert is a carpenter. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know about Sarah\u2019s infertility and your joke was more of about your late husband than it was about Sarah and Robert having kids. I think that Sarah\u2019s distress over this issue has caused her to make you the face of this issue. You can\u2019t sit infertility down in a chair and yell at it for causing you so much pain so instead Sarah is lashing out at you. Sarah should be allowed to have as much time as she needs to process this distressing news but she has no right to lie on you and destroy your reputation. I would tell your son that he needs to tell the truth.", "NTA You can\u2019t mock something you don\u2019t know.", "NTA. You didn't know. Stand your ground and stick to your version of events.", "NTA \n\nYou made a joke, and Sarah took it way out of proportions because she was emotional. It sucks for her but if you didn\u2019t know how the hell is that your fault? \n\nAlso, maybe try talking to your son about the rumors. Just tell him what\u2019s going on. Hopefully he isn\u2019t okay with these lies being spread around.", "NTA. I just don't see how this is your fault because you apparently had no idea about her fertility struggles. Also you apologized profusely and the joke that you wrote here I just don't see how it's turned into what she's told everyone else. I'm sorry that this happened to you but based on what you wrote here it was just a terrible misunderstanding that you had no way of knowing would affect her the way it did. It seems really unfair that she's telling other people you attacked her and I hope you guys are able to work things out.", "Nta. \n\nYou had no way of knowing what was going on with them and your reaction upon learning the information showed that.", "NTA You didn't know she was infertile so your comment had nothing to do with her infertility, nor did you ever insult her. \n\n> It turns out that the story has been spread that I viciously insulted Sarah and insinuated she shouldn\u2019t marry Robert! \n\nIf what you said was bad, then it wouldn't need altered when telling other people. \n\n> Am I the asshole here?\n\nNo, but it sounds like you have a fat lie to clear up. You're not a bad MIL, but she is a bad DIL for spreading a lie.", "NTA you weren't even insulting her .........", "NTA. Why would they expect you to know that without telling you. They are being unreasonable.", "Good grief. You are not a mind reader!  I\u2019m sorry Sarah was upset but you are not at fault here. \n(I also think she\u2019s got bigger issues if she can\u2019t let this go and is blabbing to all and sundry)\nNTA", "I\u2019m kind of surprised that you even need to ask, but the answer is, no, you\u2019re absolutely NTA.", "Nta. You didn't know, your not psychic and it wasn't intended in malice", "NTA   If it went down the way you told it.   If it did happen this way then Robert is gettng in with a woman who is a liar and toxic irregardless of her inferility issues.\n\nI think you need to have a frank discussion with Robert and figure out how it got to this point and if it is repairable.", "Nta, she\u2019s just over dramatic. You didn\u2019t insult her or were cruel. You didn\u2019t even know. She is badmouthing you and needs to apologize", "NTA\n\nHere's the thing: the standard that's set by our society is that women can get pregnant. The fact that that's not always the case, be it because of genetics, illness, or personal choice does not change that unless one knows better one will expect that it's a possibility. Your son and his future wife clearly did so as well, since there isn't much point to testing one's fertility if one isn't actually trying to have a child and running into difficulties with that.\nIf you, as someone who clearly knows (as in you know that they are not child free by choice but rather plan to have children someday) your son and his future wife, talk about any future (grand) kids without any pressure about time lines or special expectations, you're not doing anything wrong.\n\nThere's nothing morally wrong or questionable about what you did.\n\nYou didn't purposefully hurt your future dil. You didn't even do anything that - at least in your mind and with the information you had at that given moment - had a more than negligible chance of hurting her. That explanation together with a promise to be careful in the future should have ended that conflict.\n\nThat your daughter in law blew the conflict out of proportion may very well be her showing her own insecurities. My guess is that she herself hasn't gotten over the shock of the diagnosis, is deeply unhappy as well as overwhelmed with her own expectations for herself and her life and that new reality - and your innocent joke hit just that still heavily bleeding wound and she lashed out. If it had stayed a conflict between you and her, I'd have chosen n a h because of that. But it didn't, did it? \n\nAfter your dinner she maybe tried to explain her reaction to this faux pas and made you into the bad guy in her mind because she couldn't stand to be it herself. Because in her mind she already is, simply because her body won't be able to do what she and our society expected from it. But she went a step further and engaged other people into this situation while misrepresenting the situation. That's lying. That's makes her the a h, her personal pain and grief notwithstanding.", "NAH. It seems like Sarah was in a very vulnerable and delicate state, and I could totally see her misunderstanding what you meant to emphasize in the story, especially considering how common it is to pressure women in her age group to have kids. According to your story, you were not being deliberately insensitive, and you didn\u2019t have all the information.\n\nI\u2019d also be curious if you or anyone else in Sarah\u2019s life, like if her parents or relatives have been putting pressure on her about kids purposely or not purposely. This could have been the metaphorical straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.\n\nThe way you describe the events and your existing relationships, it doesn\u2019t seem like this is a typical situation.\n\nAs for the story going around, it\u2019s easy for these things to get out of hand. When someone\u2019s so vulnerable and upset about something so overwhelming, it\u2019s common to vent and lash out at safer, concrete things. \n\nShe\u2019s probably feeling a mix of shame, disappointment, guilt, anger, and all sorts of things. She probably also has internalized fear of rejection: you know how much women\u2019s value is tied to fertility. You have an opportunity to reach out and be a source of support. \n\nYou could write a letter or message apologizing and acknowledging her feelings, stating that you love her and are excited to have her as part of the family. That you wish you had not shared that specific story at that specific time, because although you meant it in one way, hindsight behind 20/20 after her reaction you realize how much it hurt. \n\nTell her how much you value your relationship with her, as well as her relationship with your son. Offer to talk/grab coffee/ do something together when she\u2019s ready, then give her space. Tell her you\u2019re here to support her.\n\nAvoid focusing too much on your own struggles with infertility, saying \u201cI know how you feel\u201d or giving advice, because that\u2019s often taken as patronizing.\n\nMany people on this subreddit have a very black and white view of these types of situations, but it sounds like you are two kind, reasonable people who are in a difficult situation. Some might say that Sarah is totally in the wrong and that you should be vindictive, but really, both of you are imperfect humans. As long as both of you are able to approach with kindness, I can see you moving forward together with a stronger relationship.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t know.\n\nWith that said it is very risky to mention/joke/suggest to anyone of childbearing age anything about having kids. So many people have suffered miscarriages, infertility, and other heartbreaks and you are inadvertently picking at the scab of their pain.\n\nYou didn\u2019t know. \n\nWe are in a different world now with people getting married and having kids 10 or 20 years later than they used to meaning struggles with fertility are more widespread.\n\nMaybe flowers, a card and a profuse apology will help smooth things over with future DIL.", "ESH\n\nIt is rude to voice any assumptions about a couple having children, infertility or not. \n\nThe story she\u2019s telling doesn\u2019t match what you said either. She needs therapy.", "ESH\nthey are wildly exaggerating \n\nI get yours was an innocent mistake but please, can we please all learn to avoid referring to \u201cfuture children\u201d or similar?\nIt\u2019s a topic that should be left alone, for several reasons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Over time the situation will resolve itself if you continue on with love.\n\n\n And I only say all of this because I respect your interpretation of the situation, that this is like a game of telephone, and the DIL is not intentionally over dramatizing the story, but instead expressing her hurt and badly telling the story, and people are filling in the gaps with outrage.", "NTA.

I\u2019ve never pressured them about kids as my own MIL was rather insulting to me about James and I only having Robert but I\u2019m not sure about Sarah\u2019s situation with her side of the family. \nI don\u2019t blame Sarah for the story going around because I\u2019m well aware of how things get twisted. A good friend once came to me about James having an affair- he went for coffee with his sister! \nI think going for lunch is a good idea. We often do it, as I moved closer to Robert after James died so location wise, I\u2019m quite near to them. \nThank you for your lovely comment!", "There were no assumptions.

You weren't making a joke about her infertility, but about your late husband's lack of carpentry skills vs your son's ability. \n\nI can see how future DIL could have taken it as a dig at her (hearing it as \"won't be a problem for you because you can't have kids!\"), but only because I'm sure it was already weighing heavily on her mind. Of course you didn't say that at all, and didn't know about her infertility in the first place, so you're NTA regardless. \n\nI'm sorry the messed up game of telephone is getting so out of hand.

The latter I think you would have every right to be angry about. Nothing worse than people putting words into your mouth with the added insult of spreading around that narrative to everyone within earshot. \n\nYour DIL is going to probably need to get some therapy to overcome her feelings about her infertility. Part of that therapy is going to involve her having to come to terms with the fact that other people around her are still going to mention babies, post about babies on social media, or have babies themselves etc. There will be plenty of triggers and she will have to find a way to overcome them. The rest of the world still moves on even if her world feels at a standstill. Now that you know the situation you can do your best to help her through things and be sensitive. You had no way of knowing before this incident though so imo there\u2019s nothing to feel guilty about. \n\nBest of luck, you are likely in for a rough road ahead while she grieves and works through emotions.", "NTA", "NTA. You unknowingly hit a very sensitive nerve. Sarah will hopefully realize you weren\u2019t mocking her", "NTA.  You had no way of knowing.

U didn\u2019t even know she was infertile! So how were u rude? \n\nShe is rude for acting like u came after her fertility", "Sarah is being an AH, you didn\u2019t know about the infertility, the fact that she is gossiping to everyone about you makes it so much worse, you are in no way the AH here.", "NTA! Whoa! Not only are you NTA, you need to have a serious talk with your son about her behavior. This is a huge red flag and may be indicative of how she is going to treat you in the marriage.", "NTA. It's a joke that didn't land, and how can you avoid a sensitive subject if you don't know?", "NTA.\n\nYou can't mock something you don't know about.\n\nOn the other hand, why would future DIL do this?\n\nAre you contributing financially to the wedding?  She is smearing your name.

You didn\u2019t know so how could it possibly be seen as cruel? \n\nIt was a sweet story that should in fact have made her happy that you saw her completely as family as you were prepared for them to potentially have kids. \n\nIt was never cruel. And though I do understand how she could be sensitive on the subject she Completely over reacted. \n\nShe\u2019s the one who owes you an apology.", "NTA.

It must have been very raw subject for Sarah, but the smearing of your name with friends and family isn't right.  You need to have a meeting with Robert and Sarah.  Again, tell them that the discussion about babies was made by you without the knowledge of Sarah's infertility and you meant no harm and you did apologize.  You have been told that you have viciously attacked Sarah about her infertility and friends and family are actually shunning you.  Tell them that if this is really what they intended to be your 'punishment,' you really don't want to be associated with them anymore. Sarah's actions have been mean and cruel.

That sucks, but she won\u2019t get away with it.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t know that she has infertility problems, besides, the joke wasn\u2019t about that, it was about carpentry. Also, they\u2019re the ones jumping to conclusions, infertility is tough and all, but they still can adopt, why people tend to forget that adoption is an option? Robert still can use his abilities as a carpenter to do a nursery or a crib, or whatever if they adopt. They can still have kids that way.", "NTA, but your DIL is for how she got butt hurt. I struggled with infertility too and she is acting out her pain on you. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to suffer for pain which you didn\u2019t cause. Seems to me like you\u2019re the easiest person to make the bad guy", "Oh god, NTA. At least if your version of the story is what happened, this is a pretty easy accident to make. Your comment had nothing to do with her infertility, and rested on a fair assumption, which is that your son and future DIL MIGHT plan to have children at some point. (I say this as a married person who intends to remain child free, but most of the time couples are capable of having children and choose to do so.) It was purely hypothetical and you were just making fun of your husband's poor carpentry skills. I understand your DIL's reaction in the moment but to continue to be upset about it is a gross overreaction, and made worse by the fact that she seems to be spreading a vicious rumor about it.", "NTA\n\nYou son is though. Sarah of course is being really insufferable. But your son didnt inform you and his negligence is leading to your ostrisization. And that he isn't stepping up to bat for you is salt onto the wound.\n\nI think a talk between you 3 woukd be good. And then maybe a family group chat explaining everything. And an apology from both Sarah n Robert", "NTA. You didn't say anything remotely wrong and Sarah is ridiculous. Given how unreasonable she is I think eventual estrangement was inevitable.", "NTA\n\nYou seem like a very kind person.\n\nYour story was totally appropriate. You had no idea that they were going through that. Sarah is allowed to be upset, I\u2019m sure that was distressing news for her. But it was clearly an accident and you never said anything about not marrying Robert. It\u2019s pretty disingenuous of Sarah to tell people you maliciously attacked her, when it seems clear she should have known it was an accident.\n\nLet yourself off the hook, these things happen and you really didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. Is everyone in your family crazy? What about your son? How could you have known. This is terrible.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't insult Sarah, you were teasing your late husband's lack of carpentry skills.

You didn't know, but it did hurt her badly. Maybe a small gift? Idk I'm not really good with this sort of thing", "NTA!!! You had no idea and everyone around you is being cruel and immature", "NTA\n\nYou told a cute story not knowing vital information and Sarah spun it as an attack.", "NTA.  You can't be blamed for insulting/making fun of something you didn't even know about.  Besides, you were joking about James' lack of carpentry skills, not Robert and Sarah's infertility.  If just the mention of children makes Sarah feel insulted, she really needs some therapy to get through the bad news she has received.", "NTA and they already have a baby - Sarah, who can\u2019t stop crying to whoever will listen and totally blow out and miss appropriate a misunderstanding into such a clusterfuck deserves an Oscar.", "Not the asshole. How could you possibly have known about this situation?  Your son and daughter in law are acting childish and lashing out. Unfortunately it\u2019s directed to you. You\u2019ve apologized, they need to grow up. There are millions of babies who need good homes. If they are mature enough to handle it, they should look into it. YOU deserve an apology.", "NTA and I hope you clearly explain this to everyone. Sarah sounds like she was looking for a reason to alienate you from your son. Get out in front of that.

And she might be willing to let this go if Sarah comes to her senses, sometimes people who are traumatized by recent bad news truly hear something different to what was said because they project THEIR fears and judgment of themselves on to others.\n\n\nI would also suggest she she shows him this post and gives her version to the family. Empathy does not involve letting yourself be the villain so someone else can play the victim.", "yeah,sarahs really reaching here..", "Not only that, but OP said \u201c*if* you have children.\u201d \n\nSo she was telling a funny anecdote from Sarah\u2019s future husbands childhood and didn\u2019t assume they *would* have kids. \n\nNot only that, but there\u2019s more than one way to become parents. So there could still be cribs in their future. Even if the news is too raw to process that now.", "Agreed. NTA if it went down like this.\n\nHowever, now that OP does know, OP could reach out & apologize again. OP culd try to explain their side of things now that folks are hopefully a little calmer.

I have lots of good stories to tell about him. \nI think a nice lunch or dinner out with Sarah might help to clear everything up because the poor woman has a lot going on without all this too. She\u2019s ordinarily very sweet but I can definitely understand how the story could have gotten twisted. When they got engaged I was terrified of turning into my own mother in law, who to quote one of my grandnieces favorite movies, was a \u201cheinous bitch\u201d, pardon my French. I think that has probably added to my feelings about the whole situation but I feel a lot more clarity after reading all these lovely comments.", "I agree with you!  We had problems getting pregnant and were very lucky to be successful.  MILs talking about future grandbabies like it\u2019s a given fact make me crazy.  Some couples just cannot conceive and people can be so nosy and pushy.  When you\u2019re in the thick of infertility treatments none of it is funny.", "I think they only found out very recently, so I believe it\u2019s a case of feeling very raw about the whole infertility thing.

That\u2019s what happened here.\n\nAt absolute best, it\u2019s ESH bc Sarah and hubby are walking around town talking shit.

I can understand how that would be triggering for her, but you didn't know. Honest mistakes like this can happen all the time. Yes this might have been a sore spot for her, but you apologizing was enough here.

I too struggled with infertility, so I\u2019m not without sympathy, but her reaction was ridiculous.

Best of luck resolving it!", "NTA While I understand the news of her fertility was fresh on her mind that's not an excuse for spreading lies later to others, slight excuse for her reaction at the time though.

I said exactly what was on the sheet that they had filled out themselves, only adding that one of the members had a bad back so needed a comfy safe horse as she was also a nervous rider (this member appreciated that I had asked for a safe comfy horse for her). Another member kicked off about it, took it as I had asked for a boring plod for her as well. Stated straight away that I had only asked for a specific horse for 1 member, the others I just said what was on the sheet.

You don\u2019t get to use innocent people to take that hurt out on. \n\nI only mentioned my own situation to let you know I get it, but it doesn\u2019t matter if I understand or can emphasize. \n\nWe shouldn\u2019t have to know peoples personal situations to not be assholes to each other. We should never think it\u2019s ok for others to put up with being our punching bags because we are hurting. \n\nAn outburst in the moment = maybe. But Sarah shit talked op about the situation after the fact when she instantly apologized and was respectful (the \u201cif\u201d vs \u201cwhen\u201d). Sarah is an asshole.", "I joined for a whole hour. An hour. My future MIL actually said, \"you're way more intelligent than I expected\" to me (a Mexican with a PhD). I thought I found people I could vent to...I ended up making peace with my MIL. Cuz WOW. Just wow.", "I was coming here to say just this! In the post it says the discovered RECENTLY that she is infertile. That is a whole lot to take in, especially if you wanted a big family, Sarah is probably just a living raw nerve right now. I was told at 24 that I am completely infertile and I\u2019m 26 now and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed what that really means, I was never even really sure I wanted children and the news devastated me. EVERYTHING about pregnancy and children is going to be painful to Sarah right now, not OP\u2019s fault, not okay for Sarah (or Robert) to spin it the way it was, but I feel like this can be resolved easily by open communication. OP you very clearly care about your son and future daughter in law a lot and it makes my heart happy to see, it\u2019s so rare these days. Hope it\u2019s all resolved soon.", "Yes! I\u2019ve seen those too and I think they\u2019re looking too far into it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, some of the JNMILs are tyrants but those \u201cmy baby\u201d stories annoy the shit out of me.", "Funny story, I have some serious trauma over people fake liking me then flipping a switch. My MIL is the most WONDERFUL of ladies I just straight up call her mom now. But the first time I met her she had already made up her mind that she loved me and I was her family now, it was SUPER intense and I needed some more time. Which she graciously gave to me. She had issues with her love making her step on a few boundaries but I would correct her firmly but gently. \n\nIn the middle of my being super overwhelmed and suspicious 9f her affections I would hop on JustNoMIL to remind myself that a MIL who loves me, wants to connect with me, and form our own relationship outside of as MIL and DIL, was NOT the end of the world.\n\nMy BIL and I also had our bouts of sniffing around each other with our dander up, it was uncomfortable as all get out because I was worried he was judging me and he was worried I was using his brother. Now he's one of my besties, we have a massive bromance, and I even introduced him to my best friend and now they are practically living together \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. \n\nI love my in laws, all of them are just the most wonderful people and they welcomed me and my 5 year old into their family with as little hesitation as my husband did. Just Justno and Aita makes me just appreciate my husband and his family so much more.", "Lol, I always called my nephew my baby, my child. I still do. Used to call him my \"Raja\" (King) so often that some people in the apartment thought that's his name! So glad that my sister didn't banish me from his presence!\n\n( I still sometimes say that while my toddler is my first born son, my nephew will always be my 1st child)", "I can\u2019t believe this comment has 3k Fucking upvotes. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t seem to be hiding anything. Reddit just can\u2019t handle a MIL being in the right. Jesus fucking Christ.", "Well OP did neither. She said \"if you decide to have kids, you won't have that problem.\" That's it.", "Yeah, there are some genuine horror stories but overwhelmingly, it\u2019s an echo chamber. You can\u2019t give constructive feedback to any op who is CLEARLY antagonising the situation or potentially misreading a situation, you have to validate that they have a Justno.", "Don't be easily persuaded. Having kids is a huge deal and not everyone has too. Even if you are filled with enthusiasm it is still something you should think very, very carefully about.", "Your post reminded me of my late former MIL. Before the wedding, she pulled me aside and said, \"I like you; please don't marry my son.\"\nWhen he and I got divorced, she took my side and offered to testify on my behalf, should it ever be necessary. \nShe died from Alzheimer's 8 years ago and I still miss her every day.", "My first guess was that the pain is so raw for DIL she just made a story up to be able to cope with it when the whole situation had nothing to do with her.", "Exactly; you only usually find out you have fertility issues if you\u2019re trying to conceive, and that may have been talked about.", "I feel like a lot of people say \u201cmy baby\u201d like \u201cmy team\u201d\u2026 cheering them along all the way. Ofc then there are some batshit women looking for a do-over baby, so take it all with a grain of salt.", "I call my nieces \"my babies\" all the time, I'm glad my siblings don't actually get offended and think I'm trying to steal their babies. I am also 26 and fence sitting, leaning on the side of CF so maybe that's why, but no one gets offended at \"how's my baby doing?\"", "Even if she brings it up regularly, this story was about OPs husband, not kids.. and the SiL claimed OP told her not to marry her son which also is weird in this setting?", "True. I have a JNMIL but my reasons are pretty obvious. Some of those folks on there will NEVER be pleased until their JNMILs are dead, and even then.... \"JNMIL's funeral cost X, we could have used that money for a vacay!\"", "\u0635\u062f \u062e\u0648\u06cc\u0634 \u0642\u0648\u0645 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0637\u0631\u0641 \u0648 \u0627\u0645\u06c1 \u06cc\u06a9 \u0637\u0631\u0641!\nIn my culture we consider our khalas/mother's sisters to be our mothers too.\n\nAnd there's a saying that goes something like \"selling your son for your nephew\" which is just a way to say that your nephews and nieces are just as/even more dear to you than your own children.\n\nMy aunt calls me her first child too, and your comment reminded me how much I love her. I bet your nephew loves you a lot, too.", "NTA for this. A heartfelt apology would be a nice gesture. You meant to tell a funny story about your husbands carpentry and didn\u2019t know the impact but that doesn\u2019t make it less hurtful to her or your son. You obviously feel bad and you should express that to both of them.", "Ouch OP, I get you put your foot in it, and I think that you're doing the right thing by resolving it. NTA.", "As someone who\u2019s late father in law constantly questioned when my husband and I were having children KNOWING I have fertility issues, and having to get very mean with him about it, your comment was not made out of malice. Just finding out that you are infertile is hard, and the smallest things can seemingly set off emotions for no apparent reason. I think it\u2019s wonderful that you want to clear the air with your son and future daughter in law. I wish you the best", "NTA- Why is Robert allowing Sarah to behave this way?..\nWhy is He not defending you and explaining the real situation to these ppl since he was there?..", "I was gonna check it out because I don\u2019t like how my MIL treats my SO but now I\u2019ll just avoid it. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "You didn\u2019t have to add the \u201cinfertile\u201d description in your comment, ironically. All of these types of subreddits are \u2018full of people acting irrational\u2019.", "Yeah, there are some serious just no's. It's put mine in perspective and made me *extremely* glad we've never lived in the same state (physically or state of mind!). It's just hard to see people blow up their lives when they might not have to. But, we usually don't get the full backstory either!", "That's an interesting point. I don't have kids, though that wasn't voluntary. Maybe that helps it sound okay.\n\nAnd... Happy Cake Day \ud83c\udf82", "In the situation*exactly* as you described it? NTA.\nIs you had said \"when\" instead of \"if\", don't know that I'd say AH, but it is a VERY critical syntax distinction. \nDepending how much of the \"other side of the story\" is true there's definitely AH potential. \nBut it seems like you're very aware of all the things to avoid with women and pregnancy talk and how even an offhand comment that insinuates children is a must-have to be a fulfilled and happy woman is a problem so.... mostly just commenting so I can see an update later after you speak to them.", "There\u2019s definitely some malice going on here considering how badly your reputation got tarnished. Not necessarily from Sarah, but it would be a good idea to talk about this. She was clearly upset and vented to people, meaning she probably exaggerated what happened.", "My maternal grandmother had that exact same problem.  She developed eclampsia while pregnant with my mom. Mom was born nearly 3 months early and my grandmother had to get a hysterectomy.\nEven though having a child nearly killed her, she faced all kinds of grief and scorn for failing to breed like a sow. It was considered a further sign of inferiority that the only child she did have was a girl.\nI have always thought that one of the reasons why my mother bore 7 children (4 boys) was to make up for hearing what a reproductive failure her mother was seen to be.", "Both my wife & I hate the \u201cmy baby\u201d thing and it\u2019s incredibly annoying that after 12 years her mum still doesn\u2019t respect our views. However the stories on that sub make me cringe so fucking hard. \n\nI just want to shake the authors and yell at them to grow the fuck up."]}
