My husband promised me he would come shopping yesterday because I hate it and get very resentful every year. I told my mom this before we even came to please let me arrange his time because I\u2019m not having another year where I do all the Christmas shopping and he gets to sit in his work shop or Lego room. So when she asked he jumped at the opportunity and it put me in a bad spot. She left all of that part of this out. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but at least now there\u2019s full story. \n\nEdit 2: HIS family puts this insane pressure every year that everyone should get a perfect gift and since we\u2019ve been married he\u2019s let that fall on me every year. I hate it and he promised he would help this year, specifically coming with me on Black Friday since it\u2019s the only day we have and I\u2019ll throw up if hear HIS Mom say smugly \u201coh did you find this on Amazon, do you know how they treat workers?\u201d The door opener project gAve him a way of breaking his promise to me and my mom knew our plan before we came. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so upset and we fought until 1am. \n\nMy daughter and I have a $1 bet riding on this and she is the one who encouraged me to post. I feel I\u2019m not the \u201casshole\u201d she said and I quote \u201cbeyond the asshole.\u201d\n\nI raised my kids as a single mother who pretty much sacrificed my entire identity to raise my girls\u2014whom I love. But the way I managed was by doing and getting favors from people and I\u2019ve extended this into my adult life. \n\nMy son in law is a very talented carpenter with some electrical and plumbing experience. They live across the country so I don\u2019t see them often and thus don\u2019t ask much of them. I recently bought a new Alexa enabled garage door opener and I was shocked to see how much it would cost for installation. I figured since my daughter and her husband were flying in for thanksgiving and he doesn\u2019t enjoy the shopping, cooking or watching football maybe he would enjoy installing my garage door opener. I also figured it was fair trade since I was buying all the food and cooking it.\n\nI brought this up yesterday and my son in law said he didn\u2019t mind at all. My daughter came unglued and told me I was way out of line, that we are guests, that he\u2019s been working really hard and it was classless of me to even asks. We fought all day shopping yesterday. \n\nWhen we got home he had installed the garage door opener. I tried to smooth things over and said I would pay him. He said that no he was happy to do it. My daughter said \u201cthen pay me the goddamn money\u201d so I did. Later in the day my son in law returned the money out of his own wallet.  We all went to bed but I heard them fighting well into the evening.\n\nThings are a little more calm this morning and we both agreed that we would let this Reddit help in solving our dilemma and hopefully have a nice day before they leave tomorrow.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669483698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5cw5f/aita_for_asking_my_son_in_law_to_install_a_new/", "score": 464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To the mom: if your daughter told you she didn't want to do Christmas shopping without your SIL, then you need to respect that. \n2. To the daughter: don't go shopping.  Cyber deals are a thing you know and if it bothers you so much, be selfish on your own behalf and adjust other's expectations. \n3. To the SIL: really? Your wife made a simple request and the first chance to have to blow it. You could have installed that door after coming home from shopping I'm sure.", "INFO: did you reimburse him for supplies and any tools he had to purchase because he left his tools across the county?", "INFO: How long is this task?", "Info: does it happen every time they visit? \n\nIf not every time (even if some times still) I would vote NAH. \n\nMy husband is a little more introverted and loves to have solo time and do projects for my folks while we hang out/shop/etc. it helps him enjoy the time together more to have a project/his own space before being around everyone for an extended time. That said, in my own family they started asking him to do stuff way too much and he felt like he couldn\u2019t say no so I had to privately tell him it was okay and personally defer the project list next time we visited - in a way that everyone was still happy/no one was put out/bothered. I don\u2019t appreciate your daughter coming unglued - there\u2019s a lot more loving ways to say no/say - actually he was planning on doing x without hurting anyone\u2019s feelings. \n\nFamily helps eachother to me - it\u2019s not transactional but only if you don\u2019t abuse it and the motive is love. \n\nThat said, he was probably happy to help you but your daughter sees the stress of his day to day life and probably sees the need for him to relax too. He\u2019s a good son in law and she\u2019s a good wife. And I think your a good mom/MIL too trying to think of an activity he might enjoy - just don\u2019t abuse his kindness.", "N T A, you asked, he said yes and he seems perfectly happy. It didn\u2019t take multiple days and he still got to eat etc. \n\nBut do you have a habit of frequently asking other people to do things for you to the extent that she might see this as the start of a pattern that she doesn\u2019t want to expose her husband to? It might be that you\u2019re that person who is always asking for favours and she finds that embarrassing. She might be afraid that you\u2019ll take advantage of her and her husband if she doesn\u2019t stop things right now.\n\nETA now your daughter has put her point of view, I\u2019m changing my verdict to ESH. There\u2019s a conflict going on between husband and wife and OP needs to stay out of it. She certainly shouldn\u2019t be intervening on husband\u2019s side, as she has here! Wife should be talking to husband, not OP, because he\u2019s an adult and should have stood by his commitment to being an equal partner. Husband sucks because he should be pulling his own weight in the boring, frustrating or tiring chores!", "With the daughters Edit, the only AH is the son in law. He knew what he was doing.\n\nIt\u2019s ok to ask for help. Daughter is right to be pissed. Son in law: he needs a conversation.", "After your daughter's edits, you are absolutely the asshole and her husband is too.", "NTA in the least. Wtf is wrong with your daughter?\n\nEdited to add after the daughters update: ESH including the husband", "**After reading the edit**\n\nMIL is (soft) YTA for asking her son to do something he doesn\u2019t mind doing. (She\u2019s enabling him, I\u2019ll give you that). \n\nHusband is 100% TA for jumping on an excuse to get out of the shopping after knowing you wanted him to go shopping with you. **he agreed to go shopping and dipped at the first chance!** \n\nDaughter in law is (soft) YTA for making MIL the \u201cbad guy\u201d and not the husband for dropping his responsibilities. MIL is a small part of the problem, husband is 100% the AH for accepting. You are mad at the wrong person.\n\nOverall verdict, everyone (kinda) sucks in this situation.", "Since the edit was added, im glad i didnt comment the first time around. Youre a MAJOR AH. Your daughter set a boundary and you stomped all over it and conveniently left that part of the story out to make yourself look better.... So not only were you the AH before, now that makes you a bigger AH imo. I knew there was more to the story for the daughter to flip out.....", "As I have been the daughter in this situation, I can understand her anger with the edit she made. \n\nAny time we would go visit family, the entire time my spouse would be fixing computers getting viruses off, building new ones, setting up networks. Meanwhile, I\u2019m stuck taking care of kids in a different place and not getting backup. It was hurtful and frustrating because we were there to relax and visit. \n\nI would make plans for us to go do things and visit friends only to not be able to go because of all that", "YTA. \nYour son in law is ditching the shopping, leaving it to your wife. It seems to be a pattern, and she specifically told you she wanted him to help her this year and you ignored her so you could have your garage door installed.\nSon in law was more than happy to oblige because he leaves the mental load to his wife.\nYTA, and so is he.", "Your daughter\u2019s reaction is extreme enough that it kinda feels like a *trauma response. I don\u2019t think you were wrong to ask, and your SIL was very kind to graciously help. But my judgment would depend on a lot of context that simply isn\u2019t present here. And i admit I have to wonder what \u201cI don\u2019t ask much of them\u201d is something your daughter would agree is accurate, as I have elder relatives who say things like that and yet every single time I see them, all they have is stuff they need help with. It gives the impression that all they care about is what you can do for them. It sucks, especially for a kid. If your daughter is sensitive to this, her husband likely knows\u2026 which means he may be in peacekeeper mode. Just not enough info for me to say. \n\n*i don\u2019t mean trauma in the abuse sense - just that when something upsets you and it keeps happening, your reactions can seem over the top when taken out of context.", "NTA. Helping family is a normal thing for people who care about it each. A garage door opener isn't a horrible install if you are familiar with doing DIY projects like that.\n\nWeird that your daughter was getting so upset about this on her husband's behalf.", "That edit makes you a huge asshole, Mom. You still dragged your daughter out shopping after you made your choice and asked her husband for help.\n\nHer husband was trying to get out of the shopping, and you got in the middle of a martial dispute, which you had been warned about in advance. If you didn't want to get involved, you could have asked her husband about the garage door after the shopping was done. Instead, you specifically did what your daughter warned you not to do, and got him out of the shopping.\n\nThis was not a casual act. It was a taking of sides, and deciding that the information given to you by your daughter didn't matter. \n\nYTA", "Something tells me your daughter is more aware of how often you depend on others for favors than her husband who hasn't had to live with you, so she's a lot more bothered by it. But if it doesn't take much effort and it's certainly not worth a fuss, not surprised her husband just said yes ma'am and did it, making your MIL happy always a positive thing. NAH but you and your daughter probably need therapy \ud83d\ude05", "After the edit I would say YTA. OP could have talked to their daughter and son in law when OP realized that they needed help with the garage opener so that the daughter and son in law would have been able to schedule it into their trip. Biggest AH is the son in law who is pawning all of the joint responsibility onto his wife and should have refused or at least waited until after shopping was done to fix it.", "Info re: your daughter\u2019s edit. Did you know about your daughter\u2019s request that her husband come shopping with her? Also, is the Christmas shopping something your daughter *has* to do? Because I hate Black Friday shopping, so\u2026 I don\u2019t do it. \n\nSeems to me that the whole problem would have been solved by everyone just doing what they wanted to do\u2026", "Based on the edit, ESH . \n\n\nYou knew what she had planned and why, but you ran right over it. You should have talked to her first. \n\nShe is because of her over the top reaction. \n\nHe is because he jumped at the chance to make his wife do all the Christmas shopping again. \n\n\nYou all need to treat each other better.", "YTA\n\nWith the added info from your daughter and some of your comments, you're definitely the AH. \n\nYou say this happens the majority of times they visit. She specifically asked you not to do this, so he couldn't ditch her with all the shopping responsibilities.\n\nYou did this intentionally, knowing he was using these chores to dump more of the mental/family load on your daughter. She told you as much.\n\nDon't be surprised when they stop visiting.\n\nAnd he shouldn't be surprised if he loses his wife if he doesn't shape up. Taking on the whole mental load burns people, and relationships, out.", "Lol at the people saying n-t-a, you can tell even from the way that the mom instantly said \u201cI sacrificed my whole life & identity for my daughters.. oh but I dont resent that\u201d that she disregards her daughters feelings over her own. She put so many reasons why she wasn\u2019t the ah but actually, yta immediately just because your daughter asked you to do something, and you disrespected that. She said \u201clet me manage my husbands time please.\u201d But the mom said nope I know whats better, he doesnt like it so Im gonna give him an out even if my daughter asked me not to. Oh but IM the ah?\u201d Yes. Yes you are. Apologize to your daughter for making the shopping even worse than she was already imagining by fighting with her the whole time, bet she really loved that. YTA mom.", "The edits are very telling here. YTA because your daughter asked you to specifically to not have things to do for her husband and you ignored her. \n\nHer husband is the biggest AH here though, abandoning his wife with this task and not standing up to his family.", "Based on the edits, it sounds like the husband is the asshole here.", "YTA. You need to stop asking for favors, there is nothing stopping you from learning to do things like that on your own. Your \u201cI paid for all of all of the food and did all of the cooking so it\u2019s a fair trade\u201d reasoning is nonsense: did you tell them beforehand that you would be doing all of that in exchange?

Stop imposing on people and take care of yourself!", "> I told my mom this before we even came to please let me arrange his time because I\u2019m not having another year where I do all the Christmas shopping and he gets to sit in his work shop or Lego room. \n\nOP, if this is true, you're definitely an asshole. You knew your daughter wanted him to help with the shopping and you went \"hey instead of shopping, how about you do this thing for me?\" \n\nOf course they're fighting. He's trying to get out of normal, adult, holiday responsibilities and you're helping him.", "NTA but the way you thought about this as some kind of trade it made you sound like one. I am sure that if he had said no you wouldn\u2019t have then refused to let him eat?\nI very rarely end up without a job at my GMIL\u2019s even taking to putting some tools in the boot before we go. I do stuff for her because it helps her out not because she will likely make me a cup of tea whilst I do it!", "NTA. Son in law didn't mind doing it and reiterated that when he returned the money you gave his wife for the work he did. Your daughter is making a mountain out of a molehill that she shouldn't even be involved with. This is between you and your son in law. This is also the kind of stuff families do for each other. It's not like you gave him a long list of tasks that would have kept him busy for the entire visit. I suspect this is a part of a bigger issue in their marriage that you just happened to stumble into.", "NTA no it's normal to ask family members for help all the time. He's family now if you asked him to completely rewire his garage then maybe but not installing one thing.", "NTA.  Honestly, if I was your Sil, and I had the skills,  I would be happy to help out my Mil.  I mean, why not?  Seems like a nice thing to do.  Seriously, what you are asking is a fairly quick, easy job for someone who knows what they are doing.  Family helps each other in my experience.   When I was younger and didn't have much money I would do little jobs for my parents.  I built them some stairs once and when they went to pay me I said, \"no charge. Merry Christmas!\"  They were delighted.  ( even if it was only September)", "Girl, you're so NTA. In my younger days I was a mechanic by trade. On holidays I was usually bored out of my mind as I don't enjoy sports and hanging out with the guys because....sports. While I'd prefer to be in the kitchen, I usually wasn't allowed. It never failed though, someone's car would be messing up or the host needed something fixed or installed. I ALWAYS jumped those jobs because it gave me a task to focus on instead of being bored beyond belief. If I was your SIL, I'd have done the very same thing, and would have told my wife to STFU. The only AH in this scenario is your daughter.", "NTA. You asked him and he said yes. I didn't know his wife and him share the same body. I'm sure if he declined you would have just went ahead and paid for it to be installed by someone else. Clearly your son in law loves and wants to help you when he can. I think the person with the problem is your daughter. Maybe it's because she grew up with you doing that, but that still doesn't really make sense to me.\n\nFamily helps family. It's not uncommon for the MIL to ask the SIL for help when there is no one else around that you know that could help. Maybe your daughter has some other problems going on and she took out her anger on you? I just really don't get the argument unless the guy was forced to do it.", "NTA. If you'd have asked him for multiple jobs over the time he was staying that would push you into AH territory but one favour is no big deal.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand why this is such a big deal. You didn\u2019t force him to do it and it sounds like he was happy to be able to help.", "NAH - it\u2019s pretty normal to ask for help from family if they have the time, so as long as it wasn\u2019t taking up time that you\u2019d otherwise have spent socialising with your son in law it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask. If he\u2019d looked hesitant or reluctant himself then you definitely shouldn\u2019t insist he does it but it seems like he really didn\u2019t mind. And you paid for the favour anyway, which is very reasonable. It might have been better to ask before they arrived whether he would have time or inclination to do the work, but that\u2019s more of a slight bad manners than a proper asshole thing.\n\nYour son in law did the work willingly, spoke for himself, and paid back the money afterwards - so he\u2019s been more than generous throughout this.\n\nAnd your daughter is also not an asshole for looking out for her husband\u2019s wellbeing and making sure that his holidays are relaxing and that he gets the rest he needs. Getting into an argument with her husband about it afterwards probably negated her intentions here but having tension within a marriage during the holiday season doesn\u2019t necessarily make anyone an asshole either.\n\nJust bear in mind that your daughter and son in law might not have told you the full story here - her behaviour makes a lot more sense if it\u2019s in the context of her husband having refused to do DIY jobs around *their* home because he\u2019s \u201ctoo tired\u201d or \u201ctoo busy\u201d on other days, which would make her wanting the money from you so she could hire someone to do those jobs much more reasonable and much less petulant-sounding. But again neither of them are necessarily the asshole for that because it\u2019s very different finding time or energy to do work on your home in the evenings or weekends than it is to finding that same motivation in someone else\u2019s house where you have plenty of time and little else to do.", "NTA. In my world, family helps family. He has the skills and was likely happy to be able to give something back for your hospitality of giving them a place to stay and the food to eat while doing so. I'm sure if you went to their home for the holiday you would have helped them out wherever needed.", "NTA. But next time ask before they come. Also your daughter might have wanted him to go shopping and you gave him an out without asking her first.", "A tiny bit of the AH for bringing up the fact that you bought food for the guests being a fair trade for some reason. You\u2019re NTA for asking him to help.", "NTA. His others have said, it's pretty normal to ask family members to help with something like that, especially if it's something they have skills in. If you did it constantly it would be a problem of course, but clearly you don't.\n\nYour SIL sounds like a nice guy, maybe you should adopt him, lol.", "NTA\n\nMy mom has helped me  a whole lot in life. Both with her time and money. Despite an awefull divorce that left her with nothing. \n\nSo yeah, we return the favor the way we can. My husband fixes her computer, my son mows the grass, I fast track her hospital appointments, or check on her house when she isn\u2019t there, my daughter waters her plants\u2026\n\nFamilies helps each others.", "NTA - everyone should contribute on Thanksgiving. If he\u2019d rather install a garage door opener than cook, great! But no one should be sitting on their ass doing nothing\u2026 is that what daughter thinks should have happened? Because that\u2019s nonsense.", "NTA funny thing is that many don't  have a problem with asking women to do all the shopping. Prepping. Decorating, cooking, cleaning, on holidays while the men watch football but ask thr men to do something and all he'll apparently  breaks loose. \n\nIt is a family  event and everyone should be pitching in. If his thing isn't all of the other stuff and he likes fixing things thrn there is no harm in asking if he could fix something simple. \n\nHeck, my daughter flew in and decided to tackle the garage, cleaning it out after i asked her to just move a section so we could look through food and grab out the tree. Exhausted me, but I am grateful for her help and she said she was just in the mood to do it since there was nothing else to do.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA- there\u2019s nothing wrong with asking for a favor from family as long as you\u2019re also okay with them saying no.", "NTA - He installed it while you and your daughter were shopping. I\u2019m assuming he had no other plans while visiting and staying at your house? I don\u2019t see an issue of asking family for help. \n\nSide note: I really do hope you don\u2019t remind your children how you sacrificed your entire identity to raise them. That detail seemed pretty irrelevant to the story. YOU chose to be a parent and have children. When parents say these type of remarks it comes across as if your children owe you for those sacrifices. It could be that your daughter has a slight grudge and that\u2019s why she\u2019s reacting in this manner.", "YTA for not asking prior to their arrival.", "Questions before I vote? What does the man who put the garage opener in feel?  Why is his opinion not directly  mentioned?\n\nEdit: due to the post edit.\n\nESH \n\nMom you knew SIL was booked already.\n\nDaughter why are you having a fit? If he was suppose to shop for HIS family he's a big boy he can do it by his self now, since he overbooked. Do not take on his family trauma if he isn't willing to help. If your MIL makes a snide comment refer her to the person who bought the gifts. Don't by into gendered stereotype bullshit that says the wife has to manage christmas. \n\nHusband/ SIL - you in danger girl.", "Nta. The daughter could have really just not gone shopping.  Amazon is a thing.", "With the daughter's edit, YTA! And YTA even more for leaving out the information that your daughter asked you to arrange his time to help her with shopping because your SIL clearly isn't helping her. Your daughter asked you for help and you took advantage of the situation for your own selfish reasons. Not cool OP!", "Sounds like the husband is the AH and could have said no or later, dunno why she mad at her mam for asking.", "YTA for leaving out pertinent information. Your daughter told you specifically NOT to do this kind of thing and why. You did it anyway. So the burden of shopping for his family once again fell on her while he got to do something he enjoyed. Why not wait until after they went shopping to ask? He could have done it today.", "After the daughter\u2019s edit, YTA. \n\nYou were apparently aware of a decision having been made that your SIL would accompany your daughter on the shopping trip, yet you asked for your favor anyway. I guess you decided \u201cto hell with whatever they\u2019ve got going on, I hAvE NEEDS that must be met above all else\u201d? That\u2019s disrespectful. It\u2019s like you inserted yourself right in the middle of a marital issue *of which you were given advance notice yet chose to ignore for selfish reasons*.", "Woof, what an edit. Husband is the major asshole, Mom sucks too for manipulating the situation deliberately and then playing dumb about why her daughter is upset. Daughter didn't handle it great but I wouldn't have either, so a qualified ESH.", "NTA!!! This is what families do for each other!!", "NTA\n\nYou asked and he didn't have a problem with it. I've helped family members with stuff like this over the holidays.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong in asking, you didn\u2019t force him at all. He chose to do it, why your daughter is all up in arms about it is beyond me. If anything, she\u2019s more entitled than you here, thinking she speaks for her adult, independent husband.", "NTA\n\nAs a son in law, I take great pleasure in helping my in laws with things around the house. He probably feels the same way.", "NTA at all and your daughter is acting really really weird. Her husband is an adult and she does not get to take money for his labor. Rich of her to call you classless when she demanded money for doing absolutely nothing. I would make her fork over money for the groceries and labor it took to cook the meal she came over and happily consumed.", "NTA. You asked the person with the skills and he said yes. By everything that followed, it sounds like he really was fine with doing you the favor. \n\nI think it\u2019s mildly AHish that you were thinking of him as owing you something for hosting in the first place, but as long as you didn\u2019t present it as him needing to repay you for something you gave freely, it all seems fine. \n\nI think your daughter has her own grudges at play here, perhaps about expectations you\u2019ve had of her to \u201cpay you back\u201d for things that shouldn\u2019t have needed that (which is pretty much anything done by a parent for a child in my mind).", "I've been married for 40 years and I adore my in-laws. My parents have been gone a long time and my in-laws have always been like second parents to me. I look forward to Holiday visits because I love spending time with them and it gives me a chance to use my mechanical skills and ability and help them with special projects around the house that they can't handle. We discuss it ahead of time to make sure they have the parts and tools we'll need. I have never seen it as a burden. Maybe I'm the odd one?", "NTA\n\nI don't understand all the YTA answers. Yes you can ask for a family member's expertise in solving a problem. From what I see of her writing, I don't think she would've made things weird if he had said no. \n\nThe fact that the SIL returned the money out of his own wallet probably means that he really didn't mind, and thought his wife was taking things too far. There is such a thing as wanting to help family in need without compensation.", "I'd say daughter is overreacting to you being a bit of an AH. Nobody wants to work on holiday and you just assumed he would enjoy working for you over spending time with family. He seems like the level one.", "You are N T A for asking, but I do think your reasons are sketchy. It should be ok because they live far away and you don\u2019t ask too much of them? So because they are family they are obligated to do what you ask? Or you have a right to have them do things for you? They are family. Not your errand boys when you feel like not paying a professional. \n\nThe only thing saving you right now is that he was fine with it. As far as I know you didn\u2019t push. So for that I give you a NAH. But the fact that you seem like you are owed your family helping out because you were a single mom would irritate me quite a lot.", "NTA \nNo you're not TA!

My brothers would make a special trip if they knew I needed help with something, they also knew I would do that for them in a heartbeat.

I also figured it was fair trade since I was buying all the food and cooking it.\n\nI brought this up yesterday and my son in law said he didn\u2019t mind at all. My daughter came unglued and told me I was way out of line, that we are guests, that he\u2019s been working really hard and it was classless of me to even asks.

If both of them hate Christmas shopping so much, they need to come together as a team and work out a better arrangement than a loose agreement that he'll help this year. If anyone is TA it would maybe be the son in law for breaking his promise to help shop, but honestly, I would want more context on that before declaring him TA. This post is if you're TA for asking for his help, and for that, you're not.

I'm not a handy dude when it comes to building or fixing things around the house, but computers/tech/IT is where I can be help and I usually enjoy doing it. \n\nMy GMIL is especially not the nicest person and usually cold and standoffish to significant others, but it kills my wife and BIL that she absolutely loves me and callse all the time to come over and help. When she was switching internet and phone providers, she told me Verizon was trying to explain to her how it works and all the stuff she would need to do, and she apparently said \"I don't need to do any of that, I got a grandson who can do it for me!\" And called me lol.", "INFO did you know about your daughter\u2019s agreement with her husband concerning the Christmas shopping?", "I didn\u2019t read any of the other posts, but you are both AH. \n\nThe Mother is all..

Just wants someone else to help with the kid.\n\nI do not mind babysitting. But it's the fact that it's sexist literally because I'm the only girl. Why did they only ask me when there are plenty of capable men around me.\n\nIt probably comes down to the way you asked that upset your daughter so much.  And did you ask him because he's a man so you expect him to do things like that?\n\nWhen I go home for holidays, I will often help my parents do something similar.

That way they can do it together as husband clearly hates in person shopping. Or they don't buy presents as a couple. She can gift things from her, he can gift things from him, no need to shop together. If her husband loves DIY and chose to cancel their planned shopping trip to help his MIL than its for the daughter to confront her husband on cancelling.

Daughter discusses something that makes her frustrated, how she plans on encountering it, then mom undermines that plan by asking for husbands help during the exact time they are Christmas shopping? \n\nI agree that daughter had a pretty extreme reaction, there's a lot of pent up emotion there and definitely could have bee handled in a calmer manner but HOLY SHIT if my parent threw a wrench in my carefully laid plans like that I think the shock and betrayal would make me react in a more extreme way too! \n\nIt sounds like daughter and husband need to be talking more about how to mitigate frustration around Christmas shopping and mom needs to not sabotage. \n\nI'm gonna have to go with YTA mom; you knew this would set your daughter off, and its very uncool to purposefully do that then post such an incomplete story that she looks like a raging asshole with an anger issue to internet strangers.

Perhaps she is truly just upset that you are asking her husband to work while they are visiting (which is normal in my family but I understand for others it\u2019s not) and doesn\u2019t feel like you are even listening to her POV.

Obviously there's a problem if it's only going one way, but for healthy relationships, this is mutual. You are cooking a Thanksgiving feast for everyone, screwing an Alexa device into the wall probably took him 15 minutes. I would call that a more than fair trade. It's not like you asked him to re tile your bathroom and it took him more time doing that than enjoying his visit.\n\nI do understand the other side of this though, whenever you are skilled in something useful, people like to ask you for favors. It gets old after a while, and sometimes it gets to the point where you can't enjoy visits with people because you'll end up being pressured into doing something. \n\nClearly the examples I've given are two extremes with the size and frequency of the jobs. I'm not sure where you draw the line between \"presumptuous asshole\" and \"friendly favor\" but IMO it's much closer to the latter. Again, this probably took him 15 minutes.\n\nAbout installation costs, they're all ridiculous. First it's a service charge just to get out there, then it's 2-3x their hourly wage in labor, and then whatever parts they use at premium price. I had a tech come out to fix my dryer, guy was there for maybe 45 mins, used a 75$ maintenance kit, and he changed me like $350. I get that this is what it costs to be profitable but the work itself was pretty minimal. I actually changed all the locks on my house myself with a $20 kit I found on eBay, whereas a locksmith would have charged $200+. So don't make the mistake to think that just because the service charge to have a \"professional\" come and install it is pricey, it doesn't mean the work is intensive.\n\nA small word of caution though, don't assume that someone enjoys doing their profession outside of their work hours.

We live 800 miles away and it's always a great feeling I get to get some work done. Yeah, they host us and we eat most (okay, we eat ALL) of their food...it feels like the least I can do. The kids help out and we have a great time together. \n\nThis is how I (personally)  relax, so I'd love a suggestion from any of the parents when we get there.

Or is he just the odd man out who has to pay for his meal with manual labor? He was not in a position to refuse, so she *never should have asked*. \n\nI am incredibly proud of OP's daughter for standing up for her partner against her family, even if he might be more conflict averse than her.

That's how it is supposed to work.", "I am not making up details - I am explaining how there are two possible outcomes, one of which he actually doesn't mind, one of which he feels this is an imposition.

Even if we both agreed that OP was morally correct to ask him to do it in the first place, she should have stayed around to help out instead of going out shopping and leaving him alone to do house work while she had fun. \n\n\n\nOutside of all that, I definitely agree with you about the whole \"fair trade\" thing.
