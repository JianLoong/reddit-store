It is also great that he feels safe and confident enough to deny the actions requested if he is uncomfortable at just 6 year old. Sure, some manners could be taught for future interactions with complete strangers (such as just a \u201cno thank you\u201d instead of \u201cyou stink\u201d) but this is his family member, he should feel comfortable telling them things without being \u201crude\u201d. \n\nIf BIL is ashamed or offended by a child telling him he stinks, he shouldn\u2019t stink.
