It is also great that he feels safe and confident enough to deny the actions requested if he is uncomfortable at just 6 year old. Sure, some manners could be taught for future interactions with complete strangers (such as just a \u201cno thank you\u201d instead of \u201cyou stink\u201d) but this is his family member, he should feel comfortable telling them things without being \u201crude\u201d. \n\nIf BIL is ashamed or offended by a child telling him he stinks, he shouldn\u2019t stink.

I\u2019m a retired respiratory therapist and have lost too many family, friends, and patients to that horrible plant.\n\nThis issue, though, isn\u2019t entirely about tobacco. It\u2019s about being polite. Regardless of your son\u2019s age, he needs to learn that it\u2019s impolite to call someone stinky. When he\u2019s older he can learn the nuances of that rule. For now, though, he needs to learn to not say it. You could also have modeled for him staying and visiting for a few minutes before letting him go to his room to play.

Yes, BIL is the reason he stinks. But your child didn't know this.  Yiu pretty much just taught him it is okay to voice your opinion regardless of the consequences.

Cigarettes are terrible, and any degree of inhalation is bad.", "NTA. Smokers stiiiiink. For a smoker to come into a non smoking home stinking like he did, he would have been going hard. Probably as a FU to you if he knows you're antismoking. You were being honest with your son and not normalising being around that disgusting stench. You husband needs to get over himself.", "So husband is right that it isn't polite to tell people they smell bad. But that doesn't mean OP is wrong in her answer.

Gives me a headache now.", "I quit smoking last year, and I know I will never smoke again because the smell is the most disgusting smell in the world. 2 weeks in I was in a lift with an obvious smoker and had to hold my breath the whole time because it made me feel sick. \n\nI kept asking my husband why he never said anything about the smell, he said he didn't notice. I don't know how he couldn't notice, it's a foul stench that permeates everything and it isn't something that just washes off.\n\nI do like the smell of weed though.

You can smell it without having to be particularly close to them. You can smell it through a mask. Smoking is like deciding you want to wear the world's worst perfume at all hours of the day. Seriously. Lots of people will avoid normal perfume for being overwhelming, but tobacco smoke is a whole other league.\n\nPeople can do whatever they want, but when the things they do create a kind of sphere of effect wherever they go, they're going to have to realize that people will avoid them if they don't like whatever that effect is. This goes for smoking, perfume, playing music off your phone in public, anything that effects your environment without the consent of the other people in that environment.
