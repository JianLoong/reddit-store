I love taking care of plants, and I tend to spend a ridiculous amount of money buying rare plants. Plants are my hobby, and everyone in my office has dubbed me the office plant lady.\n\nMy boss asked if I would help cover another office that was short staffed, I agreed since I would only be out of my office for a week. I watered all my plants before leaving, and didn\u2019t give them another thought. \n\nWhen I got back from helping the other office, I noticed that all of my plants had been disbursed around the office, not just near the window, where I had them previously. My coworker had moved my plants from my station to her station, and my manager had claimed my larger (and very rare) plant for her office. \n\nI was peeved, because I was gone for a week and it\u2019s as if my plants were up for dibs. So I wordlessly moved my plants back in front of my station, and moved my rare plant from my managers office to where I had it before. Even if I had humored my manager and let the plant stay there, it would not have lasted long because my managers office has no natural lighting, and I paid too much for the plant to watch it slowly die from lack of sun. \n\nMy coworkers made some comments about me taking back my plants, but I just casually shrugged and said \u201csorry, these are my babies. I like to look at them where they are.\u201d \n\nI paid for all my plants myself, but I can\u2019t help but feel a little bit guilty for taking them back.

At my old job someone (lateral to my boss but in a different department) tried to steal a plant from my cube and was stopped by my boss. They both then came up to me laughing about how my plant almost got stolen. I think there is something to be said though for not leaving anything in the office that you would be too upset about losing.
