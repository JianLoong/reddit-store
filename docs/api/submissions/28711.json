You are NTA, friend.", "NTA.  I would have a closed door discussion with your manager.  \u201cHey, I was shocked to come back and find my plants scattered all over the office.  How did that happen?\u201d  Listen.  \u201cI am not sure if you are aware that many of those plants are difficult to come by and you can kill an indoor plant just by moving to a less ideal place with conditions it does not like.\u201d", "Take them home, at least the rare one. Oh, and even if you don't, you're probably effed at the workplace. People are going to resent you, possibly the manager will turn on you; there really is no way to fix this.\n\nDid the rest of the office know you'd be back? Because taking your property while you were helping out another part of your company was really low. And your manager apparently led the steal, commandeering the valuable plant.\n\nUpdate your resume, and rethink having anything other than geraniums at your workplace.\nYou're NTA, but this sort of thing leads to gossip and backbiting.", "> My coworkers made some comments about me taking back my plants, but I just casually shrugged and said \u201csorry, these are my babies.

Can't argue with that.", "EVERYONE KNOWS YOU DON'T MESS WITH THE PLANT LADY'S PLANTS!!!!\n\nIn my office, our plant lady is meticulous about watering schedules, lighting, trimming- once I poked fun a little bit, and she informed me some of the bigger plants were from the funerals of former office employees, and that those are what carry on those employee's spirits. The biggest was from a funeral in 2005-ish. I don't touch anything because I'm a plant hospice worker (they go to their death when I care for them) and none of us dare mess with her routine. \n\nNTA in any way shape or form.", "LOL...they stole you plants and expected you to be ok with that?", "This is a non issue.

If they make comments though it might be best to take them home, especially the rare one. But you could suggest maybe if they bring a pot and soil in you can take a cutting as a compromise and providing it doesn't hurt your plant.", "NTA Im always amazed at the audacity of people.

Maybe tone it down a bit and bring some home?", "Do you bring water from home to water them? If not, then you're using valuble company resources to maintain them....I'm just kidding.\nNTA. \nIt would be one thing if they told you to remove them for some valid reason; taking up space, someone has an allergy, etc.\nBut this was just people being A-holes.\nSide note: if you still feel guilty, you could get your coworkers some small inexpensive plants for their space if they are that desperate for some greenery.", "I\u2019m still shocked at the audacity (though I really shouldn\u2019t be, I guess). How self-centered and arrogant do you have to be to go rearrange and steal someone else\u2019s possessions for no reason whatsoever?", "This. OP, I'd put stickers on the bottom of them with your name just in case there's another problem and maybe consider leaving the rare ones at home moving forward.", "She really should, especially since the manager personally took the most valuable one for their own office.

Do I need to label my lunchbox as \"personal property\"?? Buddy, I bought it and brought it. It's obviously mine.", "Your better label all your stuff them, or I am taking it.", "Knew someone who went on vacation and when she came back to her desk all her office supplies were gone.\n\nHer office mates just plundered everything (stapler, ruler, paper clips, pens) shamelessly.\n\nShe went from desk to desk and took back everything right in front of the people who stole it. Some of them even complained about her taking things back.\n\nShe learned to label everything she had and took a lot of things home to prevent them from being taken again.

If not I would absolutely tell your boss what happened and keep a paper trail of who took what.", "Perhaps in your office, that is the case.  I\u2019ve been in offices where some plants were paid for by the corporation and they had a service to occasionally water and inspect them.  This was confusing when some individuals bought/brought their own plants in\u2026 When offices or personnel had turn over, oftentimes plants would be \u2018relocated\u2019 during the transition. \n\nI came in once to my personal refrigerator having gone walkabout while I was away (in addition to my plants).  I had to do an after-hours mission to retrieve and then label all to avoid future misconceptions.  Cheers.", "Again?! :)", "This happens to me at work all that time. I hate it so much. They should have gone into the supply closet and gotten their own. Hard agree.", "I had a job once where people were constantly taking my pens and markers.  I think it was due to my desk being right next to the law library.  Also, I think people assumed that I got the pens and markers from the office supply room, but some of them I bought myself.  I actually put a post it on a marker that said 'Do not remove from this desk.  I bought and paid for it myself.'  It didn't get stolen."]}
