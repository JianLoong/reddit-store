As I know how I am, I taped a little label on all my pens, erasers, stapler...everything. I also put them away when I go on lunch. I even have co-workers return my items because they saw my name and remembered to bring it back.\n\nI suggest if you want to keep your plants in your office, that you label them.

I'd tell your manager that you didn't give anyone permission to move any of your plants for the week you were away and it was outrageous that people took your plants and then got mad when you brought them back to your space!

Worked for everybody. \n\nBut also wasn't my stuff lol. \n\nMy husband's coworker \"stole\" one of his plants from his desk since he's rarely there, but it was just a golden pothos and she knows I sent it because it's low maintenance and easy to replace if he wasn't in the office for a few weeks and it died from lack of care. She waters but doesn't move his nicer plant in a pot I painted for him - totally different scenario. It's a running joke in the office that she's a plant thief.
