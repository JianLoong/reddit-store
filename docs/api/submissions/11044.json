I\u2019m super frazzled right now but I really need a wider opinion since nobody involved can agree on who messed up.\n\nI (27F) was picked to be the maid of honor at my best friend Jo\u2019s (28F) wedding which happened last week. I was so excited! We\u2019ve been friends since we were kids and had already agreed to be each other\u2019s maid of honor way back then, but that didn\u2019t make it any less exciting. I helped Jo pick out my dress, my shoes, etc etc, everything except for my makeup. I don\u2019t agree with wearing makeup because I think the beauty industry is misogynistic and because it makes my face break out. I don\u2019t shame anyone else for wearing it but I just don\u2019t wear it myself. Jo knows this and told me that it was totally ok to go makeup free which I was super grateful for. I had thought that because Jo was ok with no makeup, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\n\nMost of the other bridesmaids as well as Jo ended up going very heavy on the makeup, so I kind of stood out. I\u2019m not self conscious even though I don\u2019t wear it, and the other bridesmaids didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t wearing it, so I didn\u2019t really mind. The wedding was very beautiful, and went perfectly until about halfway through the reception.\n\nJo\u2019s groom Henry (35M) pulled me to the side and told me how inappropriate it was for me to not be wearing makeup. He said that I was upstaging the bride at her wedding and that a woman shouldn\u2019t be going to a public event without makeup anyway. I felt so terrible. I really hadn\u2019t intended to take any attention away from Jo. I waited until after the wedding to text Jo and say that I was sorry for not wearing the makeup, and that I had heard her message loud and clear. She was super confused, and said that she really hadn\u2019t had a problem with it.\n\nWe talked on the phone and I told her what Henry had said to me. She was furious and said that she hadn\u2019t put him up to that, and that she had been very clear that she was fine with my choices. She and Henry got into a huge fight and she\u2019s been staying at my apartment for the past few days while she tries to figure out what to do. Henry and his friends have been texting me nonstop about how I ruined his wedding and his marriage, and even some of my and Jo\u2019s friends are saying that I should have just worn the makeup and that a wedding wasn\u2019t the right place to make a political statement. Jo is insisting that I wasn\u2019t in the wrong at all and the bridesmaids plus Jo\u2019s mom are on our side.\n\nEveryone in my life that knows about this has some kind of bias, so I want to know whether I was actually in the wrong. I really hadn\u2019t intended to make a political statement or anything at the wedding, and I would have worn the makeup if Jo had asked me to. I feel terrible for hurting Jo\u2019s marriage and tainting her memory of her wedding even if she still doesn\u2019t think I did anything wrong.

It feels odd on my face and i don't mind not wearing. \n\nThe last thing i would care is if any of my guests wears makeup or not.\n\nIt's super weird to know that the GROOM thought that you looked better than any other woman, including his bride, and it's more than rude to say that a woman shouldn't go out whithout makeup.\n\nHe's a creepy man and their fight has nothing to do with you, instead with his controlling, misogynistic views.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit to correct", "NTA.  I don't wear makeup either for the same reasons.  At most, maybe lipstick.  If Jo was okay with that, you need not explain yourself to anyone.  Perhaps Jo didn't tell Henry?  I don't know.

Maybe he should have been wearing make up if this upsets him so.\n\nHim making the bride look awful by saying what he said, is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nThe fact that your friend had a fight with her husband about it and now staying at your place just shows you're not to blame for this situation, something she also keeps telling you. He sounds kind of controlling, but picked absolutely the wrong person to do that with. \n\nI really hope you'll get to feel better soon.", "Lol   upstanding by not w earing makeup ?\nThat's a new one.\n\nHmm  I would have had a few drinks by that time and would have told the groom to fuck off.  \n\nNTA.   The bride was fine.  He's an asshole.  Don't worry about it.", "NTA, and frankly it\u2019s probably for the best that she found out now that Henry has a generous streak of misogynistic beliefs (vs when they have kids and he imposes these beliefs on their sons and uses them against their daughters). \n\nHenry is the only one with an issue, and needs to examine why he doesn\u2019t think women are allowed to make their own choices.", "What does Henry think you did to upstage the bride? This is very confusing. Jo was fine with you not wearing makeup. She told you multiple times she was fine. Why are you still involved? This is between Henry & Jo. You\u2019re no longer involved. \n\nWhy you chose to not wear makeup is not up for debate or open for discussion. However, if you made a point to tell everyone at the wedding why you or other women should not be wearing any makeup, that would be an issue. \n\nNTA\n\neta \u2014 as a wedding planner (for 25+ years) this is a first for me. I have never heard of anyone \u201cupstaging\u201d the bride because they chose not to wear makeup. I also have never heard of a groom that has ever noticed who was wearing makeup.

What a strange comment from a groom. Usually it's the bride who wants everyone to look identical in pictures. It's nice to hear about one who doesn't. He should be happy his wife is not superficial. It's good that she's taking some time to think. Who knows what other things came out during the argument. And for those who say OP ruined the wedding: It's better these issues come up now than in a few years.", "NTA but turns out Henry is a massive AH especially for the comment about women not going out in public without makeup.

He\u2019s the one ruining the marriage with misogyny", "This is why I hate weddings. Ok so this is an extreme example but you get the picture.\n\nYou're NTA and Henry is a dick.

I'm surprised he hadn't shown his true colors sooner. He sounds like he's from the 50's or earlier with that attitude.", "NTA\nThere is nothing wrong with wearing makeup if you like wearing it, and there is nothing wrong with not wearing makeup if you don\u2019t want to.\n\nThere is everything wrong with telling a woman how she should be presenting herself in public, double wrong for doing it behind your wife\u2019s back after she said she was ok with it.

Henry showed his true colours and that's his problem, not yours. It's better that Jo knows.", "HAHA NTA. Henry\u2019s true colors have shown. Hopefully he can cover them with some make up", "NTA\n\nIt appears that the Groom has his priorities mixed up. How could not wearing makeup upstage the Bride? Frankly, I'm confused. Unless you are drop-dead gorgeous, how could you possibly be upstaging the Bride? \n\nThe Groom had no place telling you what to do, when the Bride is the one who decides what she wants.\nI mean, it's sad that it turned into such a vicious argument between them, but it's not your fault. Perhaps it's time to turn 'Silent mode' on your phone, or even change your phone number. You did nothing wrong.", "Sounds like Jo got a veeeeery early insight into what married life will be like.\n\nA woman shouldn't go to a public event without make up? Bugger right off. \n\nNeither you nor your poor poor friend did anything wrong and anyone siding with her revolting, shallow husband is as hateful and fragile as he is.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.

How horrible it must be to think that the man she loves/loved was capable of such behaviour and mindset.", "NTA\nYou checked with the bride first and she was ok with it, and she's STILL ok with it.

Jo\u2019s fine with it, why should he care what you are doing?", "NTA. Sounds like your best friend would be better off without him", "Nta.

If you never wear makeup it would have been weird if you all of a sudden did.", "NTA.. this is ridiculous.

Henry or what his name was is a massive dipstick, though.", "Wow what an asshole statement from the groom. And I don't understand why everyone is giving their opinion on this now. Since the bride said it's okay, everyone has to shut up.", "NTA and you may have saved your friend as well.  Maybe this has enlightened her to what an AH her husband is.", "NTA, you didn't ruin their marriage. Jo just happen to find out right after the wedding what a prick she married and that her groom doesn't even think she was the most beautiful women present on her wedding (you upstaging her by wearing no make up). Trust your friend when she tells you you did nothing wrong.", "3 things: \n\n1. Henry is an old-fashioned asshole for telling you this. \n2. Henry clearly told a different story to his and Jo's friends than how it actually went. Somehow, he made his and her friends believe that you caused this fight between them, when you clearly thought that Henry came to you and said this because Jo may have said something to him. \n3. Jo is a great friend. There might be some other things going on in her marriage though, if this \"small thing\" is causing her to sleep at your place. She seems like a very reasonable person who wouldn't make these kind of decisions over nothing.", "Last year on this sub there was a bride who was pissed off that a guest upstaged her by wearing glamorous makeup. There was also a bride who kicked out a catering staff member because the staff member had heavy eyeliner. Now someone is being accused of upstaging the bride by NOT wearing makeup.\n\nNo one can win when it comes to wedding assholes.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Jo's fine. Henry is the problem here. This is a \"water off a duck's back\" situation for you. If their marriage is destroyed by this, that is not on you. Henry took it upon himself to make the comments he did and he has to live with that. Judging by Jo's reaction, maybe this isn't the first time Henry has done something like this. She needs to start speaking up to take the heat off of you because, based on the way this is worded, you did nothing wrong. I sincerely doubt this one instance alone is why she's moved in with you after she just married the guy. Something is missing here, other than an apology from Henry for being an absolute dick.", "NTA \n\nThere are clearly deeper issues between the two of them if something like this has cause a separation so soon after the wedding. \n\nIf the bride was ok with you not wearing make up, then it\u2019s a non issue.
