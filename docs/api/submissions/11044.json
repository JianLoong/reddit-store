I\u2019m super frazzled right now but I really need a wider opinion since nobody involved can agree on who messed up.\n\nI (27F) was picked to be the maid of honor at my best friend Jo\u2019s (28F) wedding which happened last week. I was so excited! We\u2019ve been friends since we were kids and had already agreed to be each other\u2019s maid of honor way back then, but that didn\u2019t make it any less exciting. I helped Jo pick out my dress, my shoes, etc etc, everything except for my makeup. I don\u2019t agree with wearing makeup because I think the beauty industry is misogynistic and because it makes my face break out. I don\u2019t shame anyone else for wearing it but I just don\u2019t wear it myself. Jo knows this and told me that it was totally ok to go makeup free which I was super grateful for. I had thought that because Jo was ok with no makeup, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\n\nMost of the other bridesmaids as well as Jo ended up going very heavy on the makeup, so I kind of stood out. I\u2019m not self conscious even though I don\u2019t wear it, and the other bridesmaids didn\u2019t mind that I wasn\u2019t wearing it, so I didn\u2019t really mind. The wedding was very beautiful, and went perfectly until about halfway through the reception.\n\nJo\u2019s groom Henry (35M) pulled me to the side and told me how inappropriate it was for me to not be wearing makeup. He said that I was upstaging the bride at her wedding and that a woman shouldn\u2019t be going to a public event without makeup anyway. I felt so terrible. I really hadn\u2019t intended to take any attention away from Jo. I waited until after the wedding to text Jo and say that I was sorry for not wearing the makeup, and that I had heard her message loud and clear. She was super confused, and said that she really hadn\u2019t had a problem with it.\n\nWe talked on the phone and I told her what Henry had said to me. She was furious and said that she hadn\u2019t put him up to that, and that she had been very clear that she was fine with my choices. She and Henry got into a huge fight and she\u2019s been staying at my apartment for the past few days while she tries to figure out what to do. Henry and his friends have been texting me nonstop about how I ruined his wedding and his marriage, and even some of my and Jo\u2019s friends are saying that I should have just worn the makeup and that a wedding wasn\u2019t the right place to make a political statement. Jo is insisting that I wasn\u2019t in the wrong at all and the bridesmaids plus Jo\u2019s mom are on our side.\n\nEveryone in my life that knows about this has some kind of bias, so I want to know whether I was actually in the wrong. I really hadn\u2019t intended to make a political statement or anything at the wedding, and I would have worn the makeup if Jo had asked me to. I feel terrible for hurting Jo\u2019s marriage and tainting her memory of her wedding even if she still doesn\u2019t think I did anything wrong.
