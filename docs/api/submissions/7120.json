I invited my friend Kelly (also 24) and her boyfriend of 10 months, Cam, to come and stay with us for 10 days. I had met Cam a few times before and we always got on well so I thought it would be fun.\n\nMy bf was away on a business trip for the first two days Kelly and Cam were there, and we all had a lot of fun. When my bf came back we all went out to dinner and I noticed things were a little awkward, but honestly my bf is very introverted especially around new people so I just put it down to the fact that Kelly and Cam are both quite outgoing, and Cam quite obviously didn't 'get' him. \n\nOver the next couple of days, Cam started asking me what I thought were invasive questions. He asked how old my bf was and a lot about the age gap, how we met, if I find it hard that he travels so often etc. I figured he was just being curious, and Kelly said he is just very blunt so I brushed it off. When we'd go out and my bf wouldn't come, Cam would ask if it bothers me that we don't enjoy the same things and that he prioritises work. A few times I had to shut his questioning down because it was making me uncomfortable. He was always apologetic and didn't seem offended so I let it go, because when he wasn't asking questions he was an affable, fun guy.\n\nOn day 6 of the trip we had dinner at our apartment and my bf was present. We were talking about how me and my bf are traveling to the US later this year for an event, and Cam said he was surprised my bf could get a visa there on account of his record because they're quite stringent. To be clear, my bf does not have a record, the charges were dropped. The whole table went silent; I could see on Kelly's face she was mortified, and I was, too, because I told her about the issues in confidence. I immediately told both of them that they had to leave, they had 15 minutes to pack their stuff and get out, and I left the table. My bf tried to calm me down but I said I wanted them out so he went and made sure they left. Apparently they had to pay a lot to get a hotel on such short notice. Kelly texted me a lot apologising but saying I overreacted by kicking them out in an expensive, foreign city. Cam even messaged to say he's sorry he upset me. I haven't spoken to Kelly since, even though she keeps texting.\n\nI'm not even angry that Kelly told Cam, it's that she either didn't tell him it wasn't appropriate to bring up, or even if she did, she continued to defend him after he'd said it. Our mutual friends are divided. Some think Kelly was out of line to defend Cam after he'd been consistently rude and she should have been on my side, some think while Cam was rude, it was probably a foot in mouth moment and that I overreacted them throwing them out immediately. I'm not sure whether it's unfair of me to hold this against Kelly.

Nothing is more frustrating to me than when people will share things their partner shares with them in confidence", "NTA. It sounds like Cam kept consistently violating your boundaries and making you uncomfortable, on purpose. Then to top it off with the comment at dinner. It was extremely rude of him and I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting them in your house anymore. Good for you for standing up for you and your boyfriend. He f*cked around and found out lmao", "Funny how Cam says he's sorry you're upset but he never actually apologizes for what he did.\n\nCam's pushing and probing and poking... he's definitely a major-league A H.

That\u2019s what his type is like- push push push, then when someone finally has had enough and fight back they say they didn\u2019t mean it. It\u2019s bullshit. He knew exactly.

He should\u2019ve stopped the first time, but didn\u2019t. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason for him to make you uncomfortable in your own house.\n\nNTA", "Honestly it sounds like Cam is an ass.  He sounds like one of those people who pick at others to make themselves look better by default.  NTA, better off without him in your life in any way.", "Once words leave your lips, you can no longer control what happens to the information. Even if you had sworn her to secrecy, you can't enforce that. \n\nThat being said, NTA because wow. Cam is an intrusive, rude person. No one should need to be told how rude it is to bring something like this up. Particularly when you hardly know the people.", "NTA and it's clear you can't trust Kelly with sensitive information. Cam was extremely unthoughtful and is judging your situation for some ridiculous reason. I wouldn't throw away your friendship but I wouldn't want Cam in your house anytime soon!", "NTA.  They came with an agenda, or atleast the visiting bf did.  Give this friendship a rest. With friends like these...", "NTA- cam was rude af multiple times and pushing ur boundaries . He was a guest in ur home, his behavior is ridiculous. Who is he to judge anything about u or ur bf. Sounds like he was being the creepy one and trying to make u feel insecure about ur relationship. And ur \u201cfriend\u201d Kelly is no better because she was clearly gossiping about it and bright this guy to ur home. She could have talked to him to behave himself the first time, even though he\u2019s an adult and shouldn\u2019t need to be said but idk they are both the AHS", "NTA - There's being persistently invasive with questions and there is being WAY out of line, which Cam was. For your friend to defend him was inexcusable. An apology needs to happen before you can move on to staying friends.", "A bit of both. He is to blunt and she should have reined in her bf better. But you did tell her all these things as bf and gf they will probabally communicate and its not to abnormal. Also this was clearly an issue before the final straw. You should have talked to her and him and properly said that the questioning was out of line rather then jumping straight to kicked out. Her bf sounds like an idiot but it doesnt seem like he has any ill intentions given what you have written. Also you left out your bf age which kind of sets off my sussometer a bit", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would however let Kelly know that she betrayed your friendship by telling her bf something you told her in confidence and you no longer trust her and will no longer be confiding in her ( if you choose to maintain the friendship). \n\nI would also let her know that her bf  was asking inappropriate questions during the visit that made you uncomfortable and by bringing up the charges he crossed a line and you want nothing to do with him and he is no longer welcome in your home.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA   \nYour friend's boyfriend was being rude and invasive in asking you questions about your relationship and your boyfriend's personal matters, and was clearly not respecting your boundaries. Furthermore, he brought up sensitive information that you had shared with Kelly in confidence and in front of everyone.  \nIt's understandable that you would want them to leave after that, especially since their presence was making you uncomfortable.  \nIt's also quite reasonable that you would be upset with Kelly for not doing more to stop her boyfriend's behavior, but also for not taking your side in the situation.  \nIt would be fair to have a conversation with Kelly about how you felt her boyfriend's behavior and her reaction to it made you feel and see if you can come to a mutual understanding .", "NTA\n\nI'm not sure given the comments I saw and your position on Kelly; I think you need to have a conversation with Kelly and ignore the friends. Because what I read is that Cam, in general, is an intrusive AH. And in your situation there wasn't a way to really kick out just Cam. But you need to have that conversation with her that Cam is a complete AH and it'll take time to get over that, if you do. That if this is how Cam is with others she should watch out (That's what I'd say at least, I get others would say that's a bit far).", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a particularly private person. I personally don\u2019t trust people like this. And the people who see how they operate, yet still trust them with other people\u2019s personal information.\n\nIt\u2019s odd that he would even bring such a thing up or feel comfortable doing so. How much is your friend discussing with him? Sheesh.", "NTA - I do think your reaction might have been a little harsh\u2026I just would have snapped at him. However, when you continually poke a bear, you can\u2019t get mad when the bear attacks.", "You seem more insecure about dating this old guy than his criminal charges tbh", "NTA. Set them boundaries!! \n\nCam is your friend's boyfriend of less than a year, and you were hosting them for a long period. Not only you were you hosting them, but your SO was too since it is a shared residence.  Cam asked intrusive questions. You aren't even friends with him. He F'd around and found out. \n\nIf it was something truly serious I would hope your ACTUAL friend would talk to you in private and not let some chump take charge that you don't even know well.", "ESH.\n\nCam was absolutely wrong to keep prodding, but I really must ask - at any point did you tell him point blank he should no longer ask any personal questions?\n\nKicking them out like that was a bit of an overreaction, even if I do understand why you were so fed up.", "INFO:  Age of your bf, also what are the charges?\n\nAnwer: Organized crime, sounds like bf got accused of being in the mafia/gang (wtf)", "NTA. Read some comments and that age gap. You're 24 so if the age isn't an issue for you then everyone needs to mind their business. As far as these charges last I looked being arrested and charged with a crime does not equal a conviction. Since he travels often for business your boyfriend would already know if he's clear to travel to the USA or not. As for Cam he's intrusive, rude and an instigator.", "Overall, YTA. You shouldn\u2019t have shared information that your SO didn\u2019t want distributed and if you trusted your friend, and she trusted her SO with that information, maybe after four days of hanging out he didn\u2019t think it would be crazy to mention something that was part of a public record (this would be the case in the US, though you stated you were from another country, and I obviously would have no idea what you can see wherever you are about dismissed cases) YTA for sharing something your SO didn\u2019t want shared, and YTA for kicking out your friends for something that was your fault, and your fault alone", "INFO: Did your boyfriend respond to Cam at all? Was your boyfriend aware you discussed this with Kelly, or did Cam in effect surprise him (and embarrass you) with this fact?", "Duuuude.  YTA.  Your friend told her BF, that\u2019s totally normal.  And his comment didn\u2019t deserve you kicking him out after you invited them to stay.", "with the guys both being uncomfortable I would assume they had a run in around what ever crime your boyfriend did\nI would say YTA as you clearly could tell they had some beef and get this blown up at the mention of this", "YTA for inviting houseguests for 10 days.  Especially considering you had a wild card in the mix.  You met Cam a few times and then jumped directly into the deep end.", "NTA- cam knew it was rude to bring it up, he did it anyway because he thought he could get away with it. He didn\u2019t expect you to call him on it and tell him he should leave for being rude and disrespectful as a guest in your home. Cam did not need to be told not to bring it up, as I\u2019m sure he knew it was a sensitive subject and a private matter. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Cam should apologize to both of you directly if there\u2019s any hope of salvaging this relationship. And that\u2019s what I would say to my friend Kelly.", "YTA.  I don\u2019t think much of Cam or his behavior, but I don\u2019t think his last comment rose to the go nuclear, throw them out of the house in 15 minutes, and stick them with a large hotel bill, level - with no chance to clear the air or explain/apologize.  It\u2019s a friendship ending move.  Sometimes friends make mistakes, and date jerks who act like assholes.  It doesn\u2019t always mean that it has to end your friendship.", "ESH. Cam is an asshole but you are also an asshole for kicking them out because Kelly is your friend too.", "Hot take, YTA for telling your friend something very personal about your boyfriend. Did you really think she would keep it confidential?", "YTA. If something is so sensitive that broaching the subject results in kicking them out of their place to stay into a foreign city within 15 min of the comments, you should not have shared the info.", "YTA.  You reacted instead of responded, and when you did, you went nuclear.  Now you are in danger of losing a friendship over a clod with no tact, or someone who, through no fault of their own, has a brain that doesn't understand tact.\n\nThe first line should have been:  Why would you ask about something so personal?\n\nThe second thing could have been excusing yourself from the table and telling everyone you weren't feeling well suddenly and aren't hungry any more, and that you are going to bed.   That sends a better message.  It gives them space to think about what he said and maybe feel remorse.  Overreacting like that allows them to focus on how irrational you acted instead.\n\nThen Kelly apologizes and you don't accept.  So you really want to throw away this friendship?  Or are you the type that will only let things get back to normal after you make sure the other person suffers as much as you deem necessary?\n\nEither way, giving them 15 minutes to leave is an AH move.  And holding it against Kelly is also an AH move.  If you want to demonstrate you are taking the high road, you lost it here.", "It was to do with his business, not anything about him being aggressive or anything like that. Tbh Kelly doesn't even know the full extent of what the charges were but wasn't to do with any 'weird' behaviour on his part if that's what you mean.", "Agree.\nNTA.", "It\u2019s none of his business either way. She didn\u2019t ask for his help. I suspect he was feeling insecure and wanted to work at the cracks of their self esteem to make himself feel better.", "He travels a lot, I'd say he's gone about 40% of the time, but he's slowed down on travelling since we moved in together. I travel with him as well, if he's going somewhere I like. At the end of the day if I had the slightest doubt he was cheating I wouldn't be with him, no man is worth the anxiety lol.", "That's the part I can't get past - 10 days! Eek! I think my max is 4. That's just too much time having guests in my space.", "That\u2019s what I think too. It\u2019s like Cam had an agenda to cause issues between them.", "The guy is 36 not really that old.", "Ugh, why should Cam have to be told not to ask intrusive questions about a subject he *shouldn't* even know about? Does he also need to be told to not shit on the floor?\n\nThere is a paucity of detail that makes me think that universal suckiness could be correct. Dropped charges aren't a ringing endorsement but then if OP's partner is a notorious wrongdoer, why would the friends stay ten days? That's too long for an intervention.\n\nEDIT: I see from other responses that the charges related organised crime so it seems that Cam wanted to roleplay he was staying with Tony Soprano. NTA", "I told him that his questions were inappropriate when they were. I didn't make a blanket statement that he can't ask me anything, but every time he asked something weird I told him to stop.", "My bf is 36.\n\nI won't say what the exact charges were but it was nothing violent, it had to do with business and there was no 'victim', the charges were brought by the police and had nothing to do with this personal actions.", "It's not public information, we're not in the US. \n\nMy bf knew I told Kelly he'd had legal issues, I never told her the full extent of what the charges were, and he knew exactly what I told her. We weren't even surprised that she told Cam, it was more that it was rude as hell for him to talk about it.", "No, he didn't, other than dealing with getting Cam and Kelly to leave, and he wouldn't have. Doing what he felt like doing about it would have not even giving me the option to be friends with Kelly again, and he doesn't like to create problems unnecessarily.\n\nHe knew I told Kelly, no one was surprised that she told Cam, because if it were the other way round I would have told him, it was more that Cam mentioned it. I was embarrassed to even know such a person, but my bf was more angry.", "Okay. Thanks for answering. I didn\u2019t need to know 100% of the details but I was worried it was something violent, so you pretty much answered that for me.\n\nAs far as Cam goes, it wasn\u2019t his business to bring up in the first place.\n\nNTA.", " In my opinion, your friend obviously can't be trusted with information you gave her in confidence, and her boyfriend's interest other people's business is not within socially acceptable limits. I feel you struck out because you were embarrassed that your boyfriend found out you discussed his personal situation behind his back. The only one not the asshole is your boyfriend.", "Are we taking tax evasion or discrimination case? Like those both deal with the business but one is much worse and makes people uncomfy.\n\nJust because it deals with his business doesn't mean it can't be bad", "So... how old is he?", "Mad respect for that! Good on you for knowing your self worth!", "Lol so you know it\u2019s weird, go to therapy.", "Why not??? This post can not be traced back to you (we don't know who you are) and no one can make a call without the info", "I guess what we\u2019re missing here is context? Especially If you guys knew she told cam, maybe after four days of hanging with you guys I could see mentioning it. Without further context, it seems kind of like an overreaction.", "Either his legal issues are off-limits for discussion (in which case why did you blab to Kelly originally, expecting she would blab to Cam) **or** his legal issues are no big deal because the charges were dropped, so why get so bent out of shape?\n\nYou invited these people for 10 days, so clearly Kelly is a good friend. Demanding they get out in 15 minutes is an overreaction to an on-topic remark that could have been anything from clueless to rude (and you don't know which). \n\nYou could have all slept this off and if in the morning cooler heads weren't prevailing then you could have told them that the trip was cut short and see ya later.\n\nI'll go ESH, but I think you're leading the pack.", "Well, it didn't have to do with discrimination, or harassment, or anything like that. There was no complainant, it wasn't something to do with anything he did to someone else.", "36, its in a comment", "No relevant, because she\u2019s in her mid 20s. Shes not 18 or 19, she\u2019s well into being an adult. \n\nWe gotta stop treating women in their 20s like children. We don\u2019t have to infantilize them. Grooming is a real concern - but after a certain point you gotta realize she is capable of making her own decisions. If those decisions are poor, then that\u2019s a function of her character, not her age. \n\nEveryone knows this is purely a gendered thing too. Nobody wants to say that out loud though. But let\u2019s be honest with ourselves - if it was a 24 year old man, nobody would be prying to find out his girlfriends age. Their would be no concern from anyone.", "Yes we can. His \u201ccharges\u201d aren\u2019t really a big part of the story, and the main conflict isn\u2019t even about the charges per se. it\u2019s about Cam being both nosey and rude as fuck.", "I'm not sure if I can edit the post with this info or it will get Flagged, but basically he was accused of being involved in organised crime. All the charges were dropped.", "Is this Cam\u2019s burner account?", "Well, in the six days they'd been there he'd seen my bf maybe three times, I think bringing up someone's arrest record when you've had like, one conversation with them is quite bold, but that's just me.", "The in a and outs of what the charges were are off limits, and I never told Kelly the full detail, but I told her the basics because it was a really hard time for me and she's my friend. \n\nI don't know if it was on topic, it was tangential, and on top of everything else he'd said over the trip it seemed like he was waiting to bring it up.\n\nBut fair enough, I'll take the judgement.", "Embezzlement?", "Thank you. My father was 15 years older than my mother, and they had the happiest, healthiest marriage I have ever seen, each devoted to the other.", "That makes it sound like he was accused of being in the mafia...", "Yeah I would agree, I couldn\u2019t tell if that was the first time they had talked in four days or if y\u2019all had been hanging out for 12 hrs a day. That makes me lean a lot more towards NTA.I would say that you reacted completely reasonably, but maybe explaining to your friend what happened and why would be a good idea", "Literally does not matter. Charges were dropped, so whatever it was is not legitimate.", "Well, I won't be calling Francis ford Coppola quite yet, but crime syndicates exist in many forms nowadays, and sometimes people see them where they're not.", "ESH. You for sharing with your friend what was a private matter between you and boyfriend. Friend for gossiping to her boyfriend about people he didn't even know. Cam for being noisy pushy and rude.\n\nIf something is told to you privately, unless you are a mandated reporter and it is something you must report, keep it in the vault!", "ESH. Y\u2019all seem well matched", "ESH\u2026 you had an insane overreaction that makes me wonder. Like no chill. Why couldn\u2019t you just tell him to stfu and go on about your night?", "NTA. you opened your doors to them and Cam keep disrespecting your SO and you in extent, while being very intrusive.\nI wouldn\u2019t want a person like this in my home not even for 10 minutes.", "NTA\n\nWhen is Kelly dropping Cam? He has the awareness of a 5 year old", "I'm gonna go with YTA. Not for kicking them out, but for sharing your partners personal stuff with other people. \n\nIf you didn't gossip and share personal information that wasn't yours to share, you would have never been in the situation you're in. Now you're placing the blame on your friends for talking about things they wouldn't even know if you hadn't run your mouth. Gossiping about a partner's personal stuff only has 3 outcomes, you lose the partner, you lose the person you told about the partner, or you lose them both. If you aren't prepared for one of those 3 things to happen, don't gossip.", "NTA, you told your friend something in confidence and she decided to tell a man she hasn't been seeing even a year.", "NTA. Mainly for the fact that Cam thought it appropriate to say it at all - and that the moment it came flying out Cam\u2019s mouth, Kelly knew she screwed up.  Let this be a lesson learned to you NOT to share any critical information about your relationship with anyone else, especially Kelly.  \n\nI think part of this is a compounded issue. It sounds like you don\u2019t know Cam all that well outside of him being your friend\u2019s boyfriend. He made it increasingly more uncomfortable for you throughout the trip. He continued to ask you invasive questions even after you asked him to stop multiple times.  Then he said something, very nonchalantly, that clearly was not appropriate for anyone to bring up.  I\u2019m not sure why he felt like that was the right thing to bring up during a casual dinner conversation. Especially when it really had nothing to do with the conversation at hand. It was rude and tactless. I\u2019m feeling very suspicious about Cam\u2019s intentions here."]}
