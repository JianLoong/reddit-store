I get on great with everyone, that has never been an issue. \n\nLast week my SIL invited us both round for dinner, as J\u2019s Mother was staying with us for the week (she lives out of town). Whilst we originally accepted the invitation, the day of (a couple days later) I was hesitant to go, and asked J if he minded if I stayed home- he did. \n\nI had just gotten my period that morning, and I could already tell today was going to be a hard day for me mentally- I just didn\u2019t feel like I would be able to let our child out of sight, let alone leave them for a few hours- yes I am in therapy, yes I can still have bad days. \n\nAnyway, J ended up convincing me to go as SIL had sadly once again not gotten pregnant through a round of IVF. Everything was going well until near the end of dinner, when I realised breast milk had leaked through my shirt. I honestly had nothing left in me after this, and just wanted to go home. My SIL said she understood completely (she\u2019s so supportive LOVE her), and had no problem with it. My Husband however was embarrassed and said no to us leaving. \n\nMy SIL gave me one of her shirts, and moved us to their couch to start pumping. J was still in the dining room with SIL\u2019s Husband, so I had already finished pumping one breast by the time he came into the lounge. When he did though, he just started yelling at me. He started ranting about how horrible I had been to his sister all day, by not wanting to go etc. and now apparently I was shoving it in her face that we have a baby and she doesn\u2019t. \n\nMind you- all I wanted to do was go home. I was cramping like hell, bleeding through products every hour (don\u2019t try to educate me on my own period please) and missing our child who I never wanted to leave in the first place. I tried to reason with J, but he said that our child is 6 months old and this is getting ridiculous now. We left after this, but on the drive home J said his sister\u2019s Husband has been giving him flack for marrying someone like me who is weak and pathetic. \n\nWhen we got home early, J explained the situation to his Mom and she was on his side- which surprised me as we have never butted heads in the past, and SIL wasn\u2019t even upset about it. She believes that my SIL is just putting on a front because she\u2019s a really kind person but was likely upset by actions- that comment made me think I might actually be in the wrong. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1678625701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pdw63/aita_for_pumping_milk_in_front_of_my_sil_when/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't want him to see them if he's just going to yell at you (if you think he would yell at you, then you have some things to think about)", "Does he understand that (in addition to all the other issues here) not pumping is very much a health risk? The last thing you need on top of everything you\u2019re going through is mastitis, which you will get if you don\u2019t empty your breasts when it\u2019s time to.", "Nta and please get away from this family, as fast as you can. I know it might take time. But, these people do not care for you at all. Please start looking into an exit strategy.  I hope I'm wrong and having a new baby has just made everyone crazy, but I doubt it.", "NTA you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and it wasn\u2019t on purpose. You can\u2019t control your body functions. The person who\u2019s having the difficulty didn\u2019t find anything wrong with it and here\u2019s your husband being angry over for her. If I\u2019m pumping for the child whom I literally made with my husband and then my husband have the audacity to shame and try to to put blame on me for something i didn\u2019t do on purpose, for sure this is a hill I\u2019ll die on. The disrespect he have show you. You\u2019re being too easy on him OP.", "Holy shit NTA. I love that your SIL is so supportive, but your husband is a total AH. He is not listening to your needs, pushing you around, and blowing up at you in a fragile state. I\u2019m so sorry OP. I can\u2019t offer good advice as idk the whole picture, but your husbands actions are\u2026 not it.", "Nta. Do you have friends that can help. Your husband and his family is abusive and you and your baby need out of that toxic and dangerous environment.", "This! NTA but get rid of your husband. It's not a choice to leak and if he forces you to visit his sister he should be aware that you have a baby and they would want one. Btw your SIL sounds great and as if she knows to distinguish...", "Your Doctor is amazing", "Oh this is a great point. As is the one about potential manipulation. The SIL seems to be the only stable support in this family\u2026", "Definitely all the more reason to bring it up.", "Now, *that\u2019s* something that can be done in the bathroom. Flush him down, forthwith!", "NTA divorce", "NTA for wanting to go home and you are not shoving it in her face but YWBTA is you stay with such a collasol AH of a husband and walking \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. Sorry but cut your losses before it gets worse.", "NTA. I'm so sorry this ~~happened to you~~  was done to you. Your husband is TA and so is his family, excepting the SIL who may or may not be depending on if she's truly supportive or putting on a kindness act. If the latter, and she really was offended, then I feel bad for her situation but cannot abide that she'd judge others for living their lives, and you specifically for how yours is going in ways that are outside your control and involve how your body works. Be kind all you want, but if your true feelings are s\\*\\*\\*\\*y ones then I don't care much about your kindness anymore. No, you need to cultivate a support structure outside of these people who would treat you this way, and that includes your massive AH of a husband. This... person makes me feel bad as a husband and a partner that someone would be this way towards someone who just **grew and birthed a whole-a\\*\\* person**, and is just trying to deal with the really bad cards her body is dealing right now. I'm not perfect but this guy makes me feel better knowing I did not and would not act like that.", ">My SIL said she understood completely (she\u2019s so supportive LOVE her), and had no problem with it.\n\nI would go with N-A-H, *buuuuut*:\n\n>My Husband however was embarrassed *and said no to us leaving*  \nHe started ranting about how horrible I had been to his sister all day, by not wanting to go etc. and now apparently I was shoving it in her face that we have a baby and she doesn\u2019t\n\nNTA, but *he is* \\- your SIL doesn't feel like he is saying so he doesn't get to put emotions on her and then yell at you for it.\n\nAgain, NTA.", "NTA-\n\nAlso, you need to take your child and run, not walk, away from this emotionally abusive man you\u2019re married to.", "Your SIL is the obly sane person here. Your husband is a complete AH! I would make hellfire under his ass right then and there if he screamed at me like that and told me what he told you.\nUngrateful SOAB, You gave him a kid with hard work, your body still has the aftereffects of a pregnancy, on top of it, you got your periods on this day,\nAs if a woman chose to bleed and have cramps and feel horrible and disgusting while on it, and if a woman chose that their breasts produce milk after birth, no matter when or where. \nMust be nice for your husband to have his body under control.\nI've tried to get pregnant 9 years, 5x with ivf, and before with medications and light hormones. Never worked out so far.\nIt doesn't mean that i couldn't stand to be n3ar people with babies. Obviously i will always be alittle envious, but im also happy for the people i like, plus i realized that not having a baby also has its ups.\nYour husband should be apologizing to you that he dragged you there when you had your first day of periods, and for basically everything he did and said to your that night.\nAlsoy what does it mean WEAK AND PATHETIC? F... HIM. No matter who said it, the fact that he said this to you afterwards means that he also feels the same way, that you are weak and pathetic.\nHonestly, i would run away. A husband who screams at his wife for basically no reason and disrespects her bcs od this in front of everyone, and then tattles to his mom what you did and brings her against you, a husband who doest care about your wellbeing or your feelings. \nI really really wish every guy in the world could have one week of periods at least, just so they get the taste of it, and hear if they ever dare ro say something like weak or pathetic to a womans face.\nUff, sorry, i blew up here completely. Your husband just made me so incredibly angry, i actually hate him i think. Only forgivable if he begges you to forgove him.\nAlso, i have a cat who i sometimes just miss so much when im at work, i can absolutely see that you would miss your baby, especially on a day like this. Also, i heard thst a womans body needs the time of a whole pregnancy to turn back to its normal shape(more or less), and i jist imagine that hormones still acting crazy, especially on your periods. Ugh, must be horrible.\nSo sorry for you, enjoy your baby for as lomg as you likey they grow up so fadt anyway, dont ever feel bad for missing them.", "NTA. And have you talked to your dr. I am not talking about your periods and all, but about how your husband treats you. Good lord that\u2019s not good.", "Your husband gives me the creeps, i just thought i watched a thriller where the husband does something horrible some dsy. NTA", "NTA. Your husband and family are HUGE AH! Who gets upset for someone missing their baby and having to pump bc of being away from their baby.", "NTA. Divorce ASAP. Try to convince your SIL to divorce too and go NC with her family. They do not seem like good people", "How tf are you weak and pathetic?! Producing enough milk to feed your baby and others in need? If anything your SIL seeing raw mothering in the modern age could influence her hormones. Like if I saw my brother and husband, then my mother tear down my postpartum SIL, I would rethink if going through IVF was worth it\u2026", "Xeah, someone with no family. Easier to control. This one day she described made me think: RUN! And I'm not one to easily say divorce. But he showed so many red flags in one night, plus that :\n\"J said his sister\u2019s Husband has been giving him flack for marrying someone like me who is weak and pathetic\"!!!\n This gave me the rest. He disrespects her, screams at her(in front of family) belittles her, i would honestly be afraid that he goes further and does something worse. Gave me the creeps. NTA OP", "Ewwww. \n\nYour husband also gets no opinion on this. He could have been the one to help you when the milk leaked. But he was embarrassed and didn't want to have to do anything. If your husband is upset that someone made his sister be reminded of her own fertility problems, then he should take a look in the mirror. The only person who put your SIL in that position is your husband, who refused to act like an adult. \n\nYour SIL helped you because she wanted you to feel comfortable and not be embarrassed. It's rather concerning that she cares more for your comfort than your husband. Especially if she has emotional baggage on the topic and your husband doesn't.", "The only person being nice to OP is SIL.\n\nShe should dump the husband and raise the baby with her instead. \n\nNTA.", "He didnt let her stay home, he didnt allow her to go home when she started leaking milk amd feeling more uncomfortable. He screamed at her, and everyone in the house could hear him. Basically belittled her in front of hid family. Said on the way home the other dude said she is weak amd pathetic. Tattled the story to MIL. yeah, what a prince DISGUSTING charming. Ii usually dont say to div2, but in this case, DEFINTLY THINK about it at least. Deeply. Talk to a therapist. Open your eyes. No need for enemies if you have a husband like this. NTA"]}
