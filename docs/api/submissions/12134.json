I get on great with everyone, that has never been an issue. \n\nLast week my SIL invited us both round for dinner, as J\u2019s Mother was staying with us for the week (she lives out of town). Whilst we originally accepted the invitation, the day of (a couple days later) I was hesitant to go, and asked J if he minded if I stayed home- he did. \n\nI had just gotten my period that morning, and I could already tell today was going to be a hard day for me mentally- I just didn\u2019t feel like I would be able to let our child out of sight, let alone leave them for a few hours- yes I am in therapy, yes I can still have bad days. \n\nAnyway, J ended up convincing me to go as SIL had sadly once again not gotten pregnant through a round of IVF. Everything was going well until near the end of dinner, when I realised breast milk had leaked through my shirt. I honestly had nothing left in me after this, and just wanted to go home. My SIL said she understood completely (she\u2019s so supportive LOVE her), and had no problem with it. My Husband however was embarrassed and said no to us leaving. \n\nMy SIL gave me one of her shirts, and moved us to their couch to start pumping. J was still in the dining room with SIL\u2019s Husband, so I had already finished pumping one breast by the time he came into the lounge. When he did though, he just started yelling at me. He started ranting about how horrible I had been to his sister all day, by not wanting to go etc. and now apparently I was shoving it in her face that we have a baby and she doesn\u2019t. \n\nMind you- all I wanted to do was go home. I was cramping like hell, bleeding through products every hour (don\u2019t try to educate me on my own period please) and missing our child who I never wanted to leave in the first place. I tried to reason with J, but he said that our child is 6 months old and this is getting ridiculous now. We left after this, but on the drive home J said his sister\u2019s Husband has been giving him flack for marrying someone like me who is weak and pathetic. \n\nWhen we got home early, J explained the situation to his Mom and she was on his side- which surprised me as we have never butted heads in the past, and SIL wasn\u2019t even upset about it. She believes that my SIL is just putting on a front because she\u2019s a really kind person but was likely upset by actions- that comment made me think I might actually be in the wrong. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1678625701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11pdw63/aita_for_pumping_milk_in_front_of_my_sil_when/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially with the men trying to speak for your SIL. Did they even ask her if it upset her?\n\nI imagine she doesn't actually care much about it because she knows babies need to be fed. I bet she feels awful because she probably think you're deliberately keeping your baby away from her because she is struggling, but in reality she would probably love to have your baby around her.\n\nThe poor SIL had all these people speaking for her and ignoring her when she says she's okay...\n\nMIL is enabling her awful sons!", "Lots of red flags from him, his mother and the husband of SIL.
