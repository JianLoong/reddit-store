The only time I got to use it was about a week after it was given to me. I wanted to use it to buy my sister and I a pair of earbuds, so when my mom had to make a quick stop at Dollar General to get a few things, I sent her in with the card to get the headphones for me (I think I was holding some food or something so I couldn\u2019t go in myself). My mom came back and gave us the headphones, and she put the card in one of the compartments of the car. After that I forgot about it. \n\nA few days, probably even a week later, I was in the passenger seat of the car and saw the card again in the compartment. When I realized what it was, wanted to use it again because I was running low on my other birthday cash and didn\u2019t want to spend any more of it. I picked it up, chuckling as I looked up at my mom.\n\nMe: Oh yeah, I forgot I had this! I should use this instead of my cash!\n\nMom: Oh, I used that to buy cigarettes\u2026\n\n(Cigarettes costed $12.80. Yes, she spent over twelve dollars PLUS TAX on cancer sticks.)\n\nMe: \u2026Oh\u2026okay\u2026\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much more conflict, but after my physical cash ran out, I started to make small comments and jokes here and there like, \u201cDang, I wish I had my gift card\u201d or that \u201cSomeone owes me fifteen dollars\u201d. I didn\u2019t take it too seriously, but my mom\u2019s reactions to the comments really irritated me. She would play it off at first, but then she gets mad and starts lecturing me about how she buys food, clothes, and everything for me, always managing to make me feel bad.\n\nYesterday, however, made me question if my mom\u2019s sanity.\n\nI mentioned the card again, but this time I pressed into it a little bit more, making it known that I wasn\u2019t going to let it go so easily. Then she exploded:\n\nMom: You know what, fine! I\u2019ll give you you\u2019re fifteen dollars back, but after that, don\u2019t expect shit from me! You know I don\u2019t joke like that, and so sick of you expecting handouts from me after everything I do for you!\n\nShe gave me the money back on cashapp, but it doesn\u2019t even matter, because today she started charging me for certain things. I have to pay her five dollars for a ride to school, because now suddenly \u201cGas isn\u2019t free.\u201d I don\u2019t even have a job yet, so all I have right now is the money she gave me.\n\nI also have to pay her a dollar to eat, drink, or even touch any of the food in the cabinets and fridge. I\u2019m scared of what will happen when the money runs out, because I\u2019m already down to nine dollars left after paying for a ride to school and to eat. My school is a mile away, which wouldn\u2019t be bad to walk in if it wasn\u2019t twenty degrees Fahrenheit (-6.6 degrees Celsius). Mind you, I\u2019m only a freshman in high school.\n\nI\u2019m starting to regret even talking about the damn card in the first place, and now I\u2019m considering just giving her the money back.\n\nAITA for mentioning the money in the first place?", "created_utc": 1698968631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17mhcrc/aita_for_constantly_mentioning_the_fifteen/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
