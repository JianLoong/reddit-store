This is my first post so sorry if I\u2019m not writing this well, but I am really upset and need some advice. My dad, step mum, half brother (11) and my step mums mum are all going on a summer holiday without me and didn\u2019t invite me. My step mum has been in my life since I was 7 and I have lived with my dad and step mum since I was 12. My mum lives in another country that is a 4 hour flight away so I don\u2019t see her often and consider my step mum and dad my parents. I currently live at home with them since I have graduated uni and come back home as I can\u2019t afford to move out yet. \n\nI found out they had booked a holiday with it telling me a few months ago when we were at a summer event, my step mum was talking to her friend and I was next to her and the holiday got brought up. Her friend said she has \u2018the holiday to look forward too\u2019 and my step mum turned to me and said \u2018we are going on holiday in August and you\u2019re not invited\u2019 and then turned back to her friend and continued talking without giving me a chance to respond. \nI then spoke to my dad a few days later and simply asked why I wasn\u2019t invited on the holiday. He said he didn\u2019t know, my step mum had arranged it and he didn\u2019t even think about me when they were organising it. I started crying and my dad said it wasn\u2019t malicious and he would ask my step mum about it. \nI was upset for not being considered seeing as we get on well as a family, we eat dinner together every night etc. I am also upset that my dad didn\u2019t even think of me or think to suggest that I should be invited. \n\nIt never got brought up again, I didn\u2019t want to bring it up again as it makes me upset as I feel excluded from the family and this is something I have had to deal with for a while. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk about it without getting angry or crying. I also already spoke about my feelings and my dad knows it upset me, I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s up to me to bring it up again. \nThey leave tomorrow and I am really upset about the whole ordeal. \n\nSo AITA for expecting to be invited on the family holiday?", "created_utc": 1692958379, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160v272/aita_for_expecting_to_be_invited_on_a_family/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then I read this:\n\n>my step mum turned to me and said \u2018we are going on holiday in August and you\u2019re not invited\u2019 \n\nAnd my heart broke for you. This feels personal. And the fact that your dad doesn't seem to care why his wife wants to exclude you even though it hurts you makes me sad on your behalf.\n\nNTA duckling. I hope you can talk to your dad about it again. At the very least to find out what they will and won't include you in going forward. It might hurt but at least it won't be a surprise.", "NTA \n\nYou feel excluded because you were. \n\nThat said, you need to bring this up with them and talk about it, with step mum and dad both present. (When they come back, not the day before they go)\n\nI know you\u2019re hurt and don\u2019t want to bring it up, but for your own sake you need to understand the motivations here to either move on or reassess. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry OP", "NTA, but your SM and dad are flaming \na$$holes.  Your SM for deliberately excluding you and your dad for not having your back.", "Thanks for all your comments! It\u2019s nice to hear other people\u2019s opinions and have some support. I just wanted to add as I think it\u2019s important, a bit more about why I haven\u2019t discussed this issue w them again. I have tried to voice my feelings about issues like this many times before and each time I get shut down and told that I am making it up (being excluded). I would also like to add that a similar situation happened like this 2 years ago when they went on holiday without me and I found out by my little brother mentioning he was excited for the holiday. The reasoning I wasn\u2019t invited is because they were invited by friends and weren\u2019t paying for it. Whilst upsetting I understood and expressed my upset about missing out on time with my family. Last year I was invited on a family holiday so I assumed that they had understood my feelings the year previously until here we are again now.", "NTA - you were at university and are still living with them. They should have considered you in their plans. \n\nFrom the sounds of it, your step mum does not consider you her daughter. I don't know but maybe now you are adult she no longer feels like she has any parental concern for you? The way she was so matter of fact of 'you are not invited' is pretty bloody cold. \n\nI say this as she has invited her side of the family but not the side of your father (you). I would be upset and disappointed as well. Your father's reaction is pretty gut wrenching as he did not even think of you for a FAMILY holiday? As essentially, are you no longer deemed part of the family anymore? \n\nI'm terms of advice, I would talk to your father about this. Stating how it comes across and how it makes you feel. As in theory, he should have thought about you during the initial planning and in theory, should have asked why his wife is excluding you. Also, to me, it seems like this holiday has been kept a secret from you as well. \n\nGoing forward, when the cats are away the mice can come and play. Free house for week so time for some friends to sleep over and do whatever you lot like to do for fun.", "NTA\n\nYou should go to your step-mum and ask her why she excluded you though. You need to know that if you want to have some sort of closure on the matter. And if there's a reason behind it you should be able to work on it together.\n\nYour father saying \"I didn't even think of you\" must have stung. What a heartless thing to do (I'm assuming he wasn't lying, so the heartless part wasn't saying it, but the action, or lack of, itself). And your step-mum is a big AH for giving you the news like that and not even explaining herself.", "NTA- but sadly your stepmother does not consider you the same amount of family you consider her.\n\nI'm very sorry about that.  I'm sorry your father is not advocating for you.  You said you consider them your parents.  They do not consider you.  At least that is the message they are sending you.\n\nBut I would take that as a baseline of the relationship.  You can attempt to talk to your father and make it clear that that is how you're taking it.\n\nLikely you would get called spoiled.   But anyone would have hurt feelings over this.\n\nI would just say if there's anything you do for them stop.", "NTA. But you should have brought it up earlier. You had months to talk about this. Your step mom doesn'T seem to know you are hurt and your father seems to forget such things (so don't be surprised if he just forgot again).\n\nThe reason might be that you are an adult now and graduated uni. So they might not want to pay for your holidays anymore or thought you don't want to go on a family vacation because you have friends and other things to do. Maybe it is something where they want to hint you in some direction (like 'get a job and don't use family vacation as an excuse to not apply'). What ever reason it is, you should have ask them. Now it is to late. So make the best out of it. Maybe see it as allowing your little brother to have time with his parents all to himself. And do a holyday for yourself. Travel with a friend or by yourself somewhere you wanted allways to go, there might be cheap option - interrail in Europe, staying at Air BnBs. Maybe do a short spa weekend.\n\nYou can ask your step mother AFTER their vacation, why she didn't include you", "NTA. You are now an adult and cannot expect to be included in family holidays automatically, but your step mom\u2019s comment makes it clear that she is actively excluding you. That seems malicious and I can imagine that you are hurt by that. If these kinds of things (being excluded or made to feel unwanted) happen more often I would get out of there as soon as possible if I were you.", "NTA. But I bet that the step mums mum is going to watch the 11 year old so your dad and stepmum can have some romantic time alone together while on vacation. A 23 year old is up late and can interfere in the parents romantic holiday time", "Find out why you werent invited. Was it because you are an adult and they cant pay for you to come ? Or was it because she genuinely doesnt want you there etc", "*<my step mum turned to me and said \u2018we are going on holiday in August and you\u2019re not invited\u2019 and then turned back to her friend and continued talking>*\n\n*<my dad said it wasn\u2019t malicious >*\n\nUhm, yes dad, it actually was...\n\nObviously you won't be included as long as step mom is around.\n\nI'd go NC with her.\n\nNTA", "ESH \n\nWhen I became an adult, I stopped going on family holidays for the most part. You're mostly the soft AH here for not simply talking to your step-mother about it. You are an adult and should be capable of having a conversation. The reason could be everything from reasonable ones like financial (they don't want the extra expenses and know you can't pay your own way), to evil-step mother behavior. \n\nKnowing the reasoning would greatly influence the judgment. I am also giving her blame for not taking the initiative to explain it. \n\nAsk:\n\n\"You said I am not invited to this family vacation. Can I ask why?\"", "You're 23 so you can't be going on family holidays forever. At your age you should be going on holidays with friends.\n\nHowever, the way your stepmum told you was unnecessarily unpleasant. I sense that she was waiting for a holiday for a long time that you weren't going on that why she planned almost in secret.\n\nYou should talk to your stepmum about your relationship and how she sees you. Tell her how she made you feel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Being excluded is never fun.\n I am sorry your step mom is an asshat and your dad is being led by his tickle stick. Talk to them express your feelings. But I encourage you to start living YOUR best life.", "INFO: Has your stepmum brought up issues before around you living at home (paying rent/contributing to the house, \u201cyou should be out on your own by now,\u201d conflict with your dad about having you live at home, saying she wants space)?\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, both of them handled this poorly. Stepmum was needlessly callous in the way she brought this up, especially in front of others, dad should have had a much clearer conversation with both you and her, and the whole thing could have been avoided by them being honest at the time of booking in a private setting. There is likely more to the story that\u2019s probably relevant to how you move forward, though not relevant to whether they were hurtful here. \n\nWhen you say \u201cI feel excluded from the family and this is something I have had to deal with for a while\u201d - is this something that has been going on since you were a kid, or since you graduated and came back home? \n\nAs written, this sounds like an underlying conflict about a stepmum not wanting an adult daughter to return and/or her thinking you should be out on your own. And perhaps her/your dad\u2019s/your mismatched expectations about adult children at home. You are NTA for being hurt that you were pointedly excluded. If the conflict started when you graduated and she has made other pointed comments about her wanting space or more contribution, for your OWN peace of mind you might want to initiate an adult conversation with her about expectations and ID where they conflict. She may be dropping hints that don\u2019t read as hints to you - they may read as exclusion. \n\nBut again: It\u2019s not ok for her to not communicate clearly, and to treat you so poorly in the meantime.", "NTA but you are an adult so maybe they expect you to pay for yourself, do you chip in at home work/expenses?", "NTA, and your dad is wrong, this was absolutely malicious. Live as simply as you can, save up as much money as you can, and get out of there. You don\u2019t deserve to be treated with such wanton cruelty.", "NTA but as an adult you'll be expected to payvfor your share. Is it possible thst it's as your dad said and it wasn't malicious, but recognition that you can't afford a vacation? \n\nStepmother may not think of you as family tho. Are you included if your dad makes the plans?\n\nYou haven't mentioned if you've gotten a job; your best strategy is to get a job of any kind and get a pt job to go with it so you can move out and have distance from them.", "How does a parent forget his/her own child after getting remarried? This seems to be a common occurrence here on Reddit, It\u2019s too bad most of the blended marriages seem to become one sided and usually one of the kids gets forgotten about. \nIt\u2019ll serve your SM right if you become successful and she has to come and ask YOU for something, and than you can turn to her and say\u2026 yes I have money, but your not getting any of if! Your NTA", "Im right there with you, went through the same thoughts.\n\nSeems like Stepmom has gotten used to a family of 3 and likes it, and Dad is crap enough not to stand up for or even remember/consider his first kid.", "I would move out while they\u2019re on holiday and go NC for awhile.", "You need to find out why your stepmother was so cold to you when she told you that you were not invited. You need to talk to your father again, and (maturely) not allow him to skirt away from the issue. You are an adult and will probably not always be invited, but the secrecy and your stepmom's comment does warrant some questions.", "does she stop being a family member at 23?", "So rent was mentioned but it never went anywhere, it was more a passing comment. I do my fair share in the house, I wash all my own clothes, bedding etc. I help with the clearing up after every meal and I cook once a week. I also pick my brother up from clubs or look after him when no one else is around. We have a cleaner who cleans the house. I also just started paying for my phone bill as I have just entered full time employment and I pay for my petrol for my car. When my car insurance is next due I will be paying for it. \nI have felt excluded and unfairly treated since I was about 14, mostly in comparison with my brother and finances. As well as comparing with my friends how they are treated by their parents. \nBut my SM and I talk everyday, we gossip and she enjoys talking to me about my life and hers. We get on well most of the time. So I feel confused about why I am excluded when I feel as though we get along.", "If that's the case, then stepmom or dad should have said so. And should have said so from the very outset of when discussions of a vacation were starting.\n\nI doubt that was actually the reason here, though. There is a big difference between \"you're not invited\" and \"you're welcome to come, but your stepmom and I will no longer be paying for your expenses.\"\n\nThe former (what happened) is just exclusion. The latter is (or can be) an invite with parameters.\n\nAnd really, to do that sort of \"we're not paying\" invite right, it's going to be more than just saying it. There should be more conversation about what it means. Setting the parameters for stuff like hotel rooms, or rental car/taxi/uber costs. Is the adult child on their own for all of those things? Parents will cover some stuff but not others?\n\nLots of possibilities, and no single right answer. One family might decide it means the adult child can share hotel room and rental, but has to chip in a certain percent for their share. Or they need to get their own room, but won't have to help cover the rental. Or maybe they're really on their own and are completely separate on everything.\n\nAlthough that last, for an adult child in their early 20s, as with OP, would really just be a subtle way of saying \"We don't want you to come, but we're not going to say it outright.\"", "No, but how many 23 year olds go on family holidays?", "Oof, since 14?  So sorry, that's not okay.  I mean, some differences between a 14yo and a then-toddler/preschooler are to be expected, but savvy parents are sensitive about those issues especially in blended families.  I'm really sorry OP.  I hope that you can have a conversation with each of them and lay out a plan for better communication from them in future.  Stinks that you have to be the one to initiate it, truly they should set the example about how to speak as adults.  \n\n(Unrelated: good for you for finding a full time job, and this is generally a really hard time to be graduating and trying to strike out on your own - sending best wishes.)"]}
