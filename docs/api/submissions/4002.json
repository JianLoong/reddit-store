It\u2019s frankly none of her business, and shouldn\u2019t matter to her if you decide never to shack up with anybody.\n\nYou - it was an accident, four years ago!

You have come across as very entitled.", "NTA\n\nOP your Mom is an AH, both for ragging on you for not beong married and for causing the accident that led to your families financial hardships.

Your mom sucks for complaining about not being married at age 23 (plus about the grad school bit when she is partially to blame).  YTA for blaming your mom for an accident (an accident caused primarily by your brother, not your mom - the driver has to be mostly at fault).  \n\nYou also have a fantasy notion of this magic life that exists in a different timeline where you didn't enlist in the navy and got to study abroad.  No one made you enlist in the navy.  Tons of people have zero money from their parents for college.  You said you still had some college fund.  You have to find a way to stop hating your mom for being in a car accident.", "it is an asshole remark, but very understandable.. so NTA to me", "ESH.\n\nLook, you've been carrying around this grudge against your parents for using money that was set aside by them for your college expenses. I get the frustration, but it sounds like they didn't have any other options at the time. Did your mom cause the accident by pressuring your brother and screaming? Maybe. Did this really have any play into your situation of being single at 23? Um, no...I seriously doubt it. And yeah, your mom stepped out of line asking about your status, but you also decided to lash back with an old grudge.\n\nHow do you think this grudge is affecting your brother? Your bitter comments may be directed at your mom, but I'm willing to bet he's feeling quite guilty for the accident.\n\nYou can't control the actions of others, but you can at least control your reaction to negative circumstances.", "NTA.

And did you not apply for student loans?\n\nMy opinion might change depending on whose money actually was in the bank. Was it money you earned and they put in there for you or was it their money that they earned with the intent to put it away for your college but their financial circumstances changed due to an unfortunate accident?", "YTA. Mom in general are pretty infamous for nagging kids about their relationship status. Being pissed off over it enough to throw a 4 year old accident back in her face is pretty shitty. Sports cars aren't cheap, at least she taught y'all how to drive and you had a college fund at some point in time. LOTS of kids don't get a DAMN thing on either of those fronts. You are not ENTITLED to a college fund. Does it suck you got clipped? Absolutely. Was it YOUR money that you earned yourself? NO.", "YTA. Pretty shitty she blamed you for being single, but is has nothing to do with the accident. Not her fault you can't go to a fancy med or law school or study abroad.\nAccidents can happen to everyone and insurances that won't help is nothing new.", "ESH. Your love life is definitely not her business, but it looks like you took the chance to express a lot of resentment against her.

In my opinion, 23 is too young to marry.

Independence is a gift, and you should try to enjoy it while you have it. \n\n\nI\u2019m sorry you missed the opportunities you did. Accidents happen, b it  it wasn\u2019t fair that you lost out on your college fund. Sometimes, life can be really shitty\u2026 I understand your bitterness, because it wasn\u2019t YOUR mistake that caused it. Your mother knows this, and that\u2019s why she was upset. She tried to redirect things to your supposed \u201cfailings,\u201d instead of accepting her responsibility in robbing you of the future you wanted!\n\nAll you can do is focus on the path ahead.

It could have been a parent losing his job, or sudden death, all of this is just life. Life is unfair. Your mother suffered the consequences too. You can\u2019t hold a grudge on her for it forever.\n\nIt is true that she has right to say anything around your private life and she shouldn\u2019t ask why you don\u2019t have a boyfriend, but your response was an asshole one.

This would be covered under the property liability coverage, unless brother was an excluded driver. If the other car was expensive enough, the policy limits might have been too low to cover it, though.

Really?", "He was learning how to drive under high pressure and his mother screamed. The mother shouldn\u2019t have stressed him out because stress just add up and would cause more mistake.

It\u2019s still also his mistake. I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say mostly responsible because I really don\u2019t think he is, he just did a beginner mistake that could in other conditions have no consequences, but I also think that if under panick you can mix up pedals, you\u2019re not ready to learn driving outside of a double pedal car yet.\n\nThat might be cultural difference though, I\u2019m not from the US but from Europe and driving at 15 is not happening in my country, plus driving with regular car and no driving teacher with double pedal car can\u2019t happen before the driving school checked your skills and gave their approval, which means you don\u2019t mess up basic stuff anymore.", "> How would the 15 yo be mostly responsible for the accident? \n\nHe\u2019s not. \n\nThe adult who decided to teach an unlicensed child how to drive on a street with cars in it was.", ">The mother shouldn\u2019t have stressed him out \n\nThe mother shouldn\u2019t have been trying to teach him how to drive on that street in the first place."]}
