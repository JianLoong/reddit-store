Even in shitty parenting situations, it seems kids are beaten over the head about behaviors, consequences, taking responsibility, etc. The brother was 15 on a learner's permit and the mother's screaming caused the accident. The family finances took a hit, including OP's college fund. There's no mention of the brother's college fund.

The holiday was brought to the island by visiting American whaling ships.[41]\n\n> In **Brazil**, National Thanksgiving Day was instituted by President Gaspar Dutra, through Law 781 of August 17, 1949, at the suggestion of Ambassador Joaquim Nabuco, who was enthusiastic about the commemorations he saw in 1909 in St. Patrick's Cathedral as an ambassador in Washington. In 1966, Law 5110 established that the Thanksgiving celebration would take place on the fourth Thursday of November.[42]\n\n> Thanksgiving (French: l'Action de gr\u00e2ce), occurring on the second Monday in October, is an annual **Canadian** holiday to give thanks at the close of the harvest season.\n\n> In the West Indian island of **Grenada**, in the Caribbean, there is a national holiday known as Thanksgiving Day which is celebrated on October 25.\n\n> In the West African country of **Liberia,** Thanksgiving is celebrated on the first Thursday of November.[49]\n\n> **The Netherlands;** Many of the Pilgrims who migrated to the Plymouth Plantation resided in the city of Leiden from 1609 to 1620 and had recorded their births, marriages, and deaths at the Pieterskerk (St. Peter's church). In commemoration, a non-denominational Thanksgiving Day service is held each year on the morning of the American Thanksgiving Day in the Pieterskerk, a Gothic church in Leiden, noting the hospitality the Pilgrims received in Leiden on their way to the New World.[53]\n\n> **The Philippines**, while it was an American colony in the first half of the 20th century, celebrated Thanksgiving as a special public holiday on the same day as the Americans. During the Japanese occupation during World War II, both the Americans and Filipinos celebrated Thanksgiving in secret. After Japanese withdrawal in 1945, the tradition continued until 1969. It was revived by President Ferdinand Marcos, but the date was changed to be on every September 21, when martial law was imposed in the country. After Marcos' ouster in 1986, the tradition was no longer continued, due to the controversial events that occurred during his long administration.[54] As of 2022, Thanksgiving has been revived as a commercial and cultural holiday, albeit stripped of its official status.\n\n> Called Umuganura Day, this is a Thanksgiving festival to mark the start of the harvest in **Rwanda**.
