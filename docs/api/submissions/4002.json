Having a partner does not mean you're having a great life.   \nAnd yeah, I would be frustrated as well if my college fund was lost because my mother screamed at my brother so hard he panicked and crashed. This is IMHO definitely her fault and her responsibility.  And for people saying it is the brother's fault: no, it isn't. As the teacher and adult the mother is responsible for making sure the learning environment is safe.   \nPlus, even though the OP is frustrated about the college fund she is not sitting around complaining but instead enlisted in the military, something not many women or people in general do, she is trying to make it work despite her financial loss.", "ETA stop blaming the present situation on your mother.

College and money doesn't guarantee that your relationship will work out and the lack of them doesn't guarantee it either, but saying because your lack of money or a college education because of an accident 4 years ago has kept you single is like saying the sprained ankle you had in second grade is the reason why you aren't a gold metal Olympic track star", "NTA and your dad needs to shut her down if he doesn't want her feelings hurt by someone else doing it.
