She didn\u2019t have much to say.\n\nThis morning I was leaving for work at 5:30 am. She told me last night that I needed to walk her dog in the morning when I got up because she didn\u2019t want to wake up that early and walk her at 5:30. \n\nSo I proceeded to walk her dog and left without saying goodbye. One reason being because I didn\u2019t want to wake her up but also because I was still bothered that she make sex conditional yesterday.\n\nI started heading to work and she calls me all pissed off and upset that i didn\u2019t kiss her goodbye. I told her I was still bothered from her rejecting me yesterday making it  conditional (which has happened couple times recently) so I was going to make the kiss goodbye conditional but also didn\u2019t want to wake her up.\n\nShe got all pissed off, said I made her cry, and said the two situations aren\u2019t the same. To me this is just some petty childish stuff and situations were similar, she made sex conditional so I would make kiss goodbye conditional.

Thats just plain normal put into weird way of phrasing\n\nIf you upset someone and turn them off, accept youre not getting laid that night jeesh", "YTA. The fact that you're in the comments arguing about what conditional means makes you sound like TA so hard. She didn't want to have sex with you. The fact she used the words she did was dumb and kinda manipulative, but she DID NOT WANT TO have sex with you. It's not about making it \"conditional\". I doubt she was super horny all ready to go, but despite her desires decided to deprive you. No, she didn't want it.

What did you ask her to do? It is relevant. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t ever have to have sex if she doesn\u2019t want to, for whatever reason, but to say \u201cyou don\u2019t deserve it\u201d?

Might be controversial, but your gf has the right to determine whether or not to have sex with you. It's her body. Same with you in reverse.

YTA YTA YTA!", "I don\u2019t know how to feel about this\n\nOn one hand. Withholding affection of any kind unless someone follows their conditions is unhealthy behavior and gross. Only showing affections if someone \u2018deserves\u2019 it is kinda disgusting Ngl \n\nEdit: I reread the beginning and I\u2019m still conflicted. You both came off as passive aggressive to each other during that inciting incident\n\nOn the other hand if she doesn\u2019t want sex. You aren\u2019t entitled to her body, you can\u2019t force her to have sex. Which granted you said if she just said she didn\u2019t want it. That was different \n\nBut on the third hand I could drag this entitlement with her getting all pissed you didn\u2019t kiss her goodbye. What if you were just tired instead hypothetically. Or just not in the mood. Of course in that case you should communicate about it hypothetically . \n\nLike don\u2019t get me wrong. You should show affection often. But I feel like getting pissed at a partner for not showing it ONCE IN A WHILE. Is something that comes off as entitled. (If it was constant neglect. That\u2019s one thing). Like how getting pissed at no sex comes off as entitled. \n\nBut also making the kiss conditional if she has sex with you also isn\u2019t healthy behavior. \n\nSo yeah I have no clue who to side with in this. Romance is confusing man. Maybe it\u2019s just me not understanding outside of fictional romance which is why I\u2019m so confused on how to feel about this.\n\nI guess \u2018everyone sucks\u2019? I honestly have no clue. Maybe nobody sucks and it just needs to be talked through calmly and thoroughly .

Sex is inherently conditional. No one wants to be intimate with someone who\u2019s not making them feel good. That said, making it specifically conditional like \u201cI won\u2019t have sex with you unless you do the dishes\u201d isn\u2019t the best way to approach this, but she does have the right to say something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m not feeling seen/wanted/appreciated/loved/whatever when you don\u2019t help around the house/take the time to love me in nonsexual ways/speak to me kindly/whatever\u201d You see the difference. Don\u2019t hold shit over each others heads, but also please take the time to take care of and be considerate of each other to help create the closeness needed for intimacy. Listen to all these people getting upvotes because your replies kind of just sound like you\u2019re looking for someone to agree with you.\n\nETA: think of it this way - do you want to be the person that\u2019s right/wins? Or do you want to put your ego aside and have a healthy relationship? Can\u2019t have both. Try seeing any problem as you and her vs the problem instead of you vs her. You should have said goodbye.", "SEX IS CONDITIONAL! The conditions are everyone is happy, turned on and in the mood for engaging. \n\nYou expecting it regardless about how she feels in response to your behavior is really dismissive of your actions and insulting to her sexual autonomy. \n\nI\u2019m glad to see you doubled down on the passive aggressiveness by not saying goodbye to her in the morning to punish her. Again. \n\nYTA", "NTA. Don't try to force a relationship that isn't happening. If you aren't compatible, just move on.", "Both. She's wrong for how she said no, you're completely right about her making it conditional with how she said it but you're also not entitled to have sex with her so you still have to respect her no, but if you're upset with her tone about it and not about not getting any in general then you're NTA.", "YTA\n\nSex is never owed to another person.", "Dude YTA. She doesn't owe you sex if she doesn't feel like it.", "NTA, just love on. Your tit-for-tat style will age poorly the deeper you guys get.

And since that\u2019s obviously something you don\u2019t want in a relationship, you should move on. Doing the same thing back just adds to the issue.", "NTA because of the last sentence you wrote.\nIt's a bit petty to not tell her goodbye, but I get why you are frustrated.\nTbh sounds like there is more to all of that.", "NAH.

Don't listen to the people saying yta. They are clearly biased,", "NTA\n\nOnly because during my lowest point mentally I did this same thing to two of my bfs. Of course they got mad. They saw sex as a more intimate way of connecting but I was incapable of reciprocating. I do not blame them at all, in any way.\n\nI caution that it may get worse, resentment growing and all that. I would suggest perhaps calling it quits before it grows into a bigger mess than it already is. Sure she may call you every name under the book but affection is affection and normal people need it.\n\nI'm going to assume there are other problems brewing so you may even find yourself feeling a tad relieved.", "NTA - she pushed you away and you are still recovering.

You both sound slightly immature, but I'm leaving her out of my judgement for the following reason.\n\nSex IS and SHOULD BE conditional, always. That's how consent works. Sex should only be done under the \"conditions\" that both parties feel safe, respected, and are enjoying the encounter. Those conditions were not met, so she didn't consent. That is fair.

This is a disgusting way to put it. I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with anyone for whom having sex would be a way to reward me or not.", ">How is withholding after an argument not the same. Wasn't the ulterior motive to punish him after the argument? \n\nNot necessarily. Sometimes you just aren't in the mood to have sex with someone after an argument. It isn't any punishing them, it's about just not feeling sexual desire in the moment", "It\u2019s possible that she is doing that, but that\u2019s a \u201cwhat if?\u201d. Women are not like men, we don\u2019t like having sex when there\u2019s conflict. It\u2019s unhealthy for a relationship! We would prefer to feel loved and secure before having sex.\n\nMost men don\u2019t really care and are all for \u201cmake-up sex\u201d, but in most cases it\u2019s not very smart. Men use sex to feel loved and secure, but for us it\u2019s typically a requirement rather than an outcome.\n\nEdit: typo", "Because you do not try to understand what the commenter is saying.", "Ignore them! Yes, she absolutely did make sex conditional. Saying you don't deserve it, was most definitely making sex conditional. \n\nHowever, she does have the right to not want to have sex if she's angry with you. And that's what she should have said. \"I don't feel like having sex, I'm still upset with you.\" \n\nYou can't have sex with someone, if you're angry with them. The same thing goes with kissing. If you're upset with someone, you're not going to want to kiss them, therefore, you had every right to not kiss her goodbye. \n\nIt does sound like you both need to sit down and talk about this though, or it's just going to keep happening.", "Could she communicate better. Sure. To me that is the smallest issue in this whole story.", "The same goes for a kiss goodbye, so yeah.", "You can't have sex but I still want a kiss goodbye. How entitled \ud83d\ude43.", "I would say that sex when you aren't feeling it and a kiss goodbye when you aren't feeling it are very *very* different levels of sacrifice.  \n\nEither way, this relationship seems built on petty fights and withholding on both ends, so I'm going ESH", "Not really entitled. That level of affection is what differs platonic relationships from romantic. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be rude or argumentative, I really do want to help you understand. Coercion is a real issue but not many people know the signs!"]}
