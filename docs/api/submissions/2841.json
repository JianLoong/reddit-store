Also typing on my phone, so apologies in advance.\n\nSo although yesterday was my wedding ceremony (in which I felt obligated to kick out my best man), the build up of this incident started on Friday night.\n\nMy groomsmen surprised me with a private room in a local bar. Not the bachelor party, but I guess they wanted to celebrate one last time together before I got married. My best man - let\u2019s call him Steve - was the main planner and told me that it was \u201cjust a night for chill drinks.\u201d Steve has been my best friend since 3rd grade. Okay, I\u2019m down for that, so we were having a fun time. Later in the evening, 3 strippers enter the room, and Steve is pressuring me to interact with them. For context, I refused to have strippers at the bachelor party because I\u2019m not the type of guy who is dreading no longer being single. That\u2019s just me though, to each his own. I make it clear to Steve I\u2019m uncomfortable, and at this point, Steve is pretty drunk and keeps on pressuring me. I text my now-wife, and she told me to just keep my cool and not create drama for the big day. So I do, even though I feel upset that Steve would disrespect my wishes like this. At some point we all leave. \n\nFast forward to the next day.\n\nSteve is sitting at a table with my now-wife, and he keeps talking about Friday night, bugging me to comment on the women\u2019s appearance. I tell him to \u201cpiss-off\u201d, to which he says, \u201cMaybe you think they were hotter than [my now-wife] and you just don\u2019t want to admit it. I know your taste in girls!\u201d This comment set me off, and I told him to leave immediately. I didn\u2019t make a big scene, and the rest of the ceremony wasn\u2019t really awkward. My now-wife and I still had a great time. \n\nToday, though, my wife is asking me if I thought I was being too harsh. She said Steve was probably joking. Steve also texted me today telling me how much of a dick I was to kick my best friend out of my wedding. He said he doesn\u2019t want to talk to me again after I embarrassed him like that.

It's your wedding, and thereby your bachelor party. He completely disregarded your preferences, and then tried to humiliate you about said preferences afterwards. Bonus points because you kept your soon to be wife in the loop.", "NTA.  He was turning your wedding day into something else that you didn't want it to be.  Sounds like Steve needs to grow up.  Maybe when he does, he'll come back around.  Until then, who needs that?", "His comments to your wife right before you kicked him out were disgusting.    You did the right thing, if not for your wife, for yourself.   He was trying to start trouble.", "NTA.  Insulting the bride's appearance at her own wedding is pretty inflammatory.  I think you probably outgrew this friendship and should take him up on letting it go.", "NTA. You repeatedly set boundaries with him that he ignored.", "His comments to your wife right before you kicked him out were disgusting.    You did the right thing, if not for your wife, for yourself.   He was trying to start trouble.", "NTA. \nHe disrespected your wishes from the beginning and even embarrassed you, and disrespectfully insulted your wife. \n\nEven though I am saying this might have been a bit too harsh (a warning could have been enough), it is your wedding and you have the right to kick him out for his actions.\n\nI would have done the same tbh.", "NTA you did a good job protecting your wife against your friends, something a lot of guys struggle with. You did the right thing and this internet stranger is proud of you,\n\nI\u2019m also pretty sure Steve\u2019s misogynistic views aren\u2019t new and he can\u2019t have any relationship with women where he isn\u2019t paying. So good job dumping him, too.", "NTA\n\nWell done, you're already demonstrating that you understand what marriage is - and that includes sticking up for your wife when people insult her. Steve sounds like a (expletive deleted) who is insecure about your happiness while he has to pay women to assiciate with him.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't need friends like him.  Whether he has alcohol problems, jealousy over your marriage, or is just an immature ass, he crossed the line multiple times and it's on him to decide if he wants to behave like a human being and salvage your friendship.", "NTA. You tried to establish reasonable boundaries with this guy, and he stomped all over them. Then he says something like that, on your wedding day, in front of your new wife!!? If he doesn't come back with a sincere apology, I think you have to face the fact that this friendship is over. He doesn't sound like the sort of guy, normal people would want to have around.", "NTA. Steve was way out of line to ignore your boundaries, and then speak to your wife like that. It sounds like Steve is pretty upset about you getting married - maybe jealous of how much more time you'll be spending away from him? But that doesn't give him a pass to act out like a child.", "NTA. \n\nYour true colours come out when you\u2019re drunk, and Steve showed his Friday night. You didn\u2019t give in to him pressuring you about strippers, bcus you respect your now-wife and stood up for her. Some friendships aren\u2019t meant to last a lifetime, and this is an example of that. Good on you for standing up to your now wife, Steve\u2019s comment was uncalled for.", "NTA...people are allowed to have boundaries, and eventually people who disrespect them get let go.", "NTA if he knows your taste in women why would he not know the one woman for you is the one you married? I love she is supportive on you and wanted to keep you from having a big argument with him, sounds like a relationship based on respect and trust. Unlike Steve. You might have grown apparat, it happens, the three strippers was his idea of fun and he care dmore about that than your comfort. And then talking about it at the wedding, just wtf. Sorry, don't really think that friendship is a healthy one", "NTA. Steve did something he knew would make you uncomfortable in hiring strippers for the party, then he ambushed your wife about it & was talking smack about you by implying that she doesn't stack up compared to a stripper & you would have preferred the eye candy he hired. The guy is an asshole, period. Good for you for throwing him out of your wedding, & from where I sit you've lucked out that he doesn't want to talk to you ever again. Why would you want someone so disrespectful in your life?\n\nAnd I get it that your wife is trying to be conciliatory because she doesn't want to be seen as coming between you & your best friend. But this is your decision to make, & you are not an asshole for refusing to let someone badmouth both of you to your faces at your wedding.", "NTA\n\nHe disrespected your wife and went against your wishes with the no strippers. If it was a joke then it was a really bad one.", "NTA.  Ask your wife why she cares more about Steve's reaction and not hurting Steve's feelings than the fact Steve's not acting like someone who likes you *or* her, much less a friend who cares about and wants you to be happy.  If he doesn't want to talk to you over that, then good riddance.", "NTA.\nGood riddance\nYour integrity and your loyalty are commendable.\nMaybe Steve will grow up, someday.", "NTA. I can't imagine anything more inappropriate or disrespectful to say at a wedding. Steve started trouble by inviting the strippers when you had already told him you were uncomfortable. Then, when you handled the situation gracefully, he insulted your new wife by comparing her, the bride, unfavorably with other women. What kind of friend does that? \n\nBest friends treat each other with respect. You don't get to try to hurt your best friend's bride's feelings or cause trouble in a new marriage and play the \"I'm his best friend, so I get to do it\" card. Maybe you have some idea why he acted that way, but if I were you, I wouldn't want to talk to him again either.", "NTA the man bagged out your wife.", "Steve is jellin!\nNTA", "NTA.", "All you need to know is that, as opposed to apologizing for being an AH, he tried to blame you. \n\nWonder how often this has happened over your friendship, and you sucked it up, thinking, *oh, that's just Steve.*\n\nRegardless, Steve has made super clear who he is. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. He sounds like a jerk. I think you\u2019ve out grown this guy.", "NTA\nYou didn't want strippers, he invited strippers. You didn't want to interact with them, he kept pressuring you. Which is, in fact, harassment. \n\nWhat he did on your big day was just the cherry on top really. I don't think anyone needs people who blatantly disrespect their boundaries in their lives.", "NTA It honestly amazes me how sometimes people don\u2019t know when to shut their mouth and continually push things too far. It wasn\u2019t funny.", "NTA, he was being too much of a stereotypical lad, plus strippers are such a rubbish clich\u00e9, its fine if your into it and go along, but what he said at the wedding was out of line. Id give him the benefit of the doubt and say the occasion got the better of him and maybe alcohol.", "NTA. WTF is wrong with him? That is very disrespectful to say something like that to a groom at a wedding. You have to either be really drunk or really stupid to say something like that at a wedding. If I were you, I'd ditch the friendship for good. If someone keeps peer pressuring you into something that you don't feel comfortable with, they're not really your friend.", "NTA", "INFO- you said you kicked him out of the ceremony, but the context makes it sound like it was the reception, after the ceremony.", "NTA- proud of you.", "NTA.    A best friend wouldn't be such an asshole", "NTA\n\nHe disrespected you, he disrespected your wife, and he made an ass of himself. He didn't deserve to be in your wedding.\nBy the sounds of it everything else went on drama free so clearly you took proper action to fix the problem.", "I was a bit on the fence at first, leaning more towards NTA because you've been friends with him for such a long time, but this whole thing during the meal seemed like he either wanted to stir up shit (maybe he is the one who regrets that you're no longer single/available/whatever?) or he VASTLY overestimated his own \"joke\"\n\nI've done my fair share of bad jokes, but this one was in such bad taste ...", "Having strippers at this bachelor party against your wishes is a big violation but not totally unforgivable. Talking smack about your wife and comparing her to those strippers to her face on your wedding day is unforgivable and definitely a damn good reason to kick humor anyone else out who disrespects your wife in such a manner. NTA. He's cutting you off until you apologize. Sounds like a great wedding gift. Congratulations on the marriage.", "NTA maybe your wife is so chill because she knows you have her back? Either way, you don't have to hang out with some one that disrespects your boundaries", "You embarrassed him??? GTFOOH.
