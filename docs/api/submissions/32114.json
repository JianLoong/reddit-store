I (24M) live with my girlfriend of 10 years now. We both graduated and got our first house together. It's been great. I'm not close with my dad. We ended up with bad blood between us in my teens because when he remarried after the death of my mom, his wife wanted all traces of my mom removed from the living spaces of home to make it \"feel like her home\" and they were not willing to compromise and keep some up for me. My dad told me I can make those decisions when I pay the bills. Since I was a kid that wasn't possible and so, all my mom's photos, keepsakes and anything she ever added to the house on her own were taken down and stored in my room because I said dad didn't get to keep it if he didn't think enough of mom to keep even one thing of hers up.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have a lot of childhood and family photos in our place. I kept all of mine safe at my aunt's house until I had my own place. My girlfriends family are big on taking photos so she has a lot of them too. We also have photos of us from our 10 years together.\n\nDuring the house warming my dad's wife noticed that she wasn't in any of the photos around the home and nothing she ever gifted me was there. She took offense and dad took offense on her behalf. He confronted me on the lack of sign that I had a stepmom. I shrugged him off and told him to focus on the party. He didn't like that. So a few days later he comes back over and tells me I should show some sign of his wife being part of the family and having one photo of her would not kill me. I told him he can make decisions about my home when he pays the bills for my home. He went red in the face and told me that was SO different. I told him it was not different. I said his home was supposed to be my home back then but he needed to take making his wife comfortable to the extreme and showed me how little he thought of mom or me in the process. He accused me of acting 4 instead of 24 and then he told me I was petty for throwing his words back in his face like that.\n\nHe stormed off and a few more days went by and then he started sending me these random texts that are essentially just him repeating that I behaved like a child and throwing those words back at him did not help me make a valid point. He told me I hurt his wife out of spite and I threw his words back at him out of spite and it's time for me to grow up.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701438174, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188c5yi/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_can_make_decisions/", "score": 2069, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stepmother also sounds wild to just neglect the fact there is a child who lost his mother. She sounds very self centered.

He's throwing a tantrum because he hates being on the served side of what he previously dished out.\n\nHe's right about it being different, though. It was much worse when he did it to you.

I\u2019m so sorry you had that experience. Your dad and his wife are behaving atrociously and have been since she moved in by the sounds of it.

If you had a close relationship with her, she\u2019d be on the wall, but her rejection of your mother\u2019s memory (and your dad callously supporting this rejection) immediately set a tone between you two.

(And if that's true, there are techniques of dealing with narcissistic family members if you can't go nc, so have a search around for that.) It really sucks that your father is siding with her but it sounds like he's deep in the cycle of narcissistic control and abuse. You're never going to change his mind and while he himself is not *entirely* the problem, he's now a \"flying monkey.\" Your stepmom wants the accolades of motherhood without having done any of the actual work eg. letting you grieve for your mother when you were a child.

I finally told him one day that has been over 30 years and I am tired of hearing about it, and that set him off even more.  \n\nYou did nothing wrong, and he set the precedent by his actions in the past.

Hurting feelings is not always a malicious act sometimes it\u2019s the natural consequence of learning some hard truths. Could this have been delivered more gently? Yes absolutely but that\u2019s your choice to make. And using his words back at him is just speaking a language he taught you and you know he understands the nuances.

You and your GF have a home together. It is up to the two of you how you keep it. That said I have the following thoughts\u2026.\n\nIf you have no place in your life or in your heart for step-mom, that is what you have reflected in your choice to exclude the presence of her photos - and it seems that is how it has been perceived.  If you are excluding her due to your own past hurt that is just something you need to be aware of.  I point these out simply as something to think about. \n\nAs an aside - I get how you feel. It can take a long time to heal from certain kinds of hurt.\n\nWhatever the reason it is your space to decorate how you wish and including or excluding anyone for any reason doesn\u2019t make you the AH. \n\nIf I had any advice it would be as follows.  If you care for or have any love at all for stem-mom, you might call and tell her that. You can if you choose attempt to express that you are working through past hurt and trauma and it will take the time it takes. That no consideration was made for you about preserving your mother\u2019s memory when you needed it as a teen, and you are embracing that now. [I know from my own experience that hurt a lot and it lingers.]\n\nIf you are doing it out of spite, anger, or revenge, the only outcome of that is to spread hurt and pain and alienate others. Which in the long run will likely hurt you more in the end also. \n\nIn any case I wish you and your GF the best in your new home together.", "You have gotten a lot of advice but I am going to go in a bit different direction.\n\nBasically, don\u2019t debate, don\u2019t engage in justification.  Simply don\u2019t respond and don\u2019t get into justifying your position.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty basic, your house, your rules.  It really does go back to who pays the bills.\n\nNow if you had an otherwise good relationship with your step mom I don\u2019t see why a picture of the whole family couldn\u2019t be up.  BUT if it wasn\u2019t a pleasant relationship then absolutely not.\n\nIn the end you need to decide if you want a continuing relationship with your dad/stepmom.  If so be the bigger person.  \n\nYou can placate him with a single photo while keeping many times that up of your mom.  Sort of still makes the same point while maliciously giving him a bone.", "So you and your GF started living together at 14?", "NTA for throwing it back in his face. But, have you had any relationship with the stepmom? Seems like there is something since you had them to the house warming and she's apparently given you gifts over the years.  Do you want a future relationship with her or your father especially if y'all decide to have kids?  You've made your point to your dad and he's feeling the burn but now you have to look to the future.  If you want any relationship with them then extend the olive branch and set out one of her gifts or a photo with her and your father.  Maybe even have a conversation like an adult were you tell them both how much you resent them deleting your mom when you were a teen. Give them the opportunity to understand and apologize or show any kind of contrition and then decide if that is enough to leave the resentment in the past.  You are young with hopefully a LOT of years ahead of you...what do you want those years to look like?", "Overall NTA with what you displayed in your house, but were TA in what you did at your dads house.\n\nIf the stepmom felt uncomfortable with photos of your mom around, they had every right to make the decision at an adult level to remove them, but also you should have been able to keep some photos of your mom in your room.\n\nTaking all of them and telling your dad he had no right to own them since he didn't display them was very immature and hurtful.\n\nThe decision for your dad to not display the photo's may have been very hard for him and your mom likely still has a place in his heart. Moving forward from a death is very difficult for everyone in those circumstances.\n\nYour dad is TA now because he has no right in saying what you should and should not display in your own home.\n\nI've been dating a lady for 5.5yrs with 3 children who lost her husband, and she has a few photos up of her deceased husband and none of me, we don't live together though and I don't have a problem in her displaying the photo's because I totally understand family is everything.

I (24M) live with my girlfriend of 10 years now. We both graduated and got our first house together. It's been great. I'm not close with my dad. We ended up with bad blood between us in my teens because when he remarried after the death of my mom, his wife wanted all traces of my mom removed from the living spaces of home to make it \"feel like her home\" and they were not willing to compromise and keep some up for me. My dad told me I can make those decisions when I pay the bills. Since I was a kid that wasn't possible and so, all my mom's photos, keepsakes and anything she ever added to the house on her own were taken down and stored in my room because I said dad didn't get to keep it if he didn't think enough of mom to keep even one thing of hers up.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have a lot of childhood and family photos in our place. I kept all of mine safe at my aunt's house until I had my own place. My girlfriends family are big on taking photos so she has a lot of them too. We also have photos of us from our 10 years together.\n\nDuring the house warming my dad's wife noticed that she wasn't in any of the photos around the home and nothing she ever gifted me was there. She took offense and dad took offense on her behalf. He confronted me on the lack of sign that I had a stepmom. I shrugged him off and told him to focus on the party. He didn't like that. So a few days later he comes back over and tells me I should show some sign of his wife being part of the family and having one photo of her would not kill me. I told him he can make decisions about my home when he pays the bills for my home. He went red in the face and told me that was SO different. I told him it was not different. I said his home was supposed to be my home back then but he needed to take making his wife comfortable to the extreme and showed me how little he thought of mom or me in the process. He accused me of acting 4 instead of 24 and then he told me I was petty for throwing his words back in his face like that.\n\nHe stormed off and a few more days went by and then he started sending me these random texts that are essentially just him repeating that I behaved like a child and throwing those words back at him did not help me make a valid point. He told me I hurt his wife out of spite and I threw his words back at him out of spite and it's time for me to grow up.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I think OP is choosing not to put out a fire they didnt start.", "I don't want a photo of someone in my home who neither my girlfriend or I care for. My dad's wife is not someone I want to stare at in my home. She doesn't deserve it.", ">She has been part of your life, for good or ill, since you were a teen.\n\nDo you hang pictures of all of your traumatic experiences in your home?", ">But, would it kill you to be the better person?\n\nWell it wouldn't kill him yes. BUT allowing people to trample over your feelings and decisions in your own home sets a horrible precedent. It basically teaches the father that he can berate and harass the OP into doing what he wants. I am all for compromises and learning and growing but it cannot be all on one person to be making those compromises. Because rather then \"being a better person\" you become a door mat. If the father (and more importantly step mother) also tries and shows some growth (like acknowledging what they did to the OP when they were young) sure I would be all for being a better person. But his father response was just to blow up and call the OP a kid for his feelings.", "I don't have photos of her. They probably think I should but I didn't actually keep anything like that ever. I never cared to keep photos of us.", "NTA. Your dad is right in one instance the situations are different. You were a teen grieving the loss of his mother and dealing with a new stepmom and a father who decided it was ok to erase any traces of your mom, even items they liked just because she bought them which is a weird level of petty/insecure, in the home you lived in and had to live in because you were a kid. You had to be there and deal with this behavior and your father let you be hurt and dismissed your feelings when he should have been a supportive parent. \n\nYou, on the other hand, are an adult starting his own life and own family in his own home. You can decide whose pictures are put up and who you want represented around your house. Your house that your father is not required to live in. Your house that never had anything of your stepmom in it so no one was being erased. \n\nVery different, his behavior was inappropriate and makes him an a h. Your behavior is normal and not a h material.", "I'm glad you were able to save some of those items to bring to your new home(congratulations)! You were allowed to have comfort items back then & I'm sorry that was taken from you.", "NTA.  Karma's a bitch ain't it.  That's how he raised you, his house his rules.  Well, now it's your house your rules.  How insecure do you have yo be for both of them to do that?", "If he doesn't want you throwing \\*his\\* words back at him, maybe try some new ones: \n\n\"She didn't care about hurting my feelings when I was a grieving child who had no choice but to living in that home, why should I care about hurting her feelings when she's a grown ass adult who can choose not to visit mine if it bothers her.\"\n\nThe fact is that she didn't treat you like family (by prioritizing her own jealousy of a dead woman over your comfort and grieving) so you have no obligation to treat her like family.", "So she felt insecure about a dead woman, class act. Your father is calling you immature/disrespectful because he has no other argument. What he wants is a child he can control so he can make his wife happy, but you're not letting him and he can't outright say it. Feel free to tell all and sundry what he did, and what he's doing now.", "As for SM, I would tell him she isn't your mom, and you have no strong feelings about her. She is your dad's wife. Period..", "NTA. \n\nRock your kids in that chair, as your mother probably did with you.", "Ngl like wedding photos would be appropriate to take down, but art and other stuff? Wow sorry", "Lol, you don't need to keep even a single pic of her in your house, she never cared enough about you to keep your moms stuff in the home that was also yours.", "My late cousin's daughter had the opposite problem. Any pics/items of her mom had to be kept in the 'public' areas of the house, she couldn't have one in her room, and even trips to the cemetery to visit her grave had to be family events. The first thing she did at 18 was go by herself.", "Well, someone is definitely acting like a 4 year old but it ain't you brother. Congratulations on the house, and enjoy displaying your mom's things all you want.", "It sounds like she's very immature and insecure.  I cannot imagine any parent being so callous and cold hearted to his childrens grieving process. I'm so sorry you went through this and are still dealing with her immaturity and your fathers lack of understanding your POV. PS You could be really petty if you'd like and find the least flattering picture of her you possibly can, put it in an ugly frame and make sure to display it right next to your favorite picture of you and your Mom where all will see it next time they come over. If they ever do.", "I wanted to give you a fist bump just reading the title. To be honest your dad sounds 4 and you sound like an adult LOL. Truth hurts and they didn't like the flavor of their own medicine. Sounds to me like you and your (clearly wonderful) GF have made a lovely home together with picutres and items from both of you that bring joy and comfort. The heck with dad and stepmom enjoy your life. Congrats on your first home and a beautiful relationship. EDIT forgot NTA.", "I'd add that depending how long this goes on for this could effect any type of inheritance if that is something you are concerned about. Seems your dad's wife has a lot of pull over him. \n\nNTA though, this is your house. If your dad thinks anything is wrong with your behavior, you should remind him that you learned it from him and his new wife. \n\nI am sorry you had to live in a house where your dad's new wife tried to erase your mother and your dad didn't defend her, if anything, for your sake.", "I have one for my husband who passed away (his choice) because we have three kids together. Even when a boyfriend was living here, it never even occurred to me to take it down, and if bf had suggested it... Well that relationship would have ended faster than it did.", "But he's not arguing with a kid now, is he? You're an adult homeowner making adult decisions, so his argument is garbage. \n\nTell him an adult homeowner making adult decisions isn't some kid living under his rules. NTA.", "All these people are telling you write books out to this man, but that's never gonna work and you're never gonna 'win' any argument with someone like this because they possess no respect for you to care about such things. Instead, I would simply tell him something like this, in whatever manner you choose:\n\n\"Dad, I'm an adult, I support myself, and handle my own. You don't have to like the decisions or choices I make, but I'm telling you now that if you want a relationship with me, you're going to have to respect them. I have told you my decision regarding this photo fiasco and it is not going to change. I will not talk about any longer. Any attempts to further argue with me about this will get you blocked if over the phone, or I will leave if we are in person. This is not up for debate or argument.\"\n\nAnd the most important part: *follow through.* I'm not telling you to go no contact if that isn't something you want, but information diets and enforcing boundaries and space are *critical* for parental relationships with people like this. My own relationship with my mom improved after I made it abundantly clear that we *will not* talk about certain things if she wants a relationship with me. I had to be firm with her and tell her something very similar to the above, and then we didn't talk for a few months.\n\nIt's been years since that final, no holds barred, screaming argument, and fortunately our relationship is better than it ever was when I was a teenager. And on *my* terms. That's the most important realization to have when dealing with a parent like this: you no longer have to put up with their bullshit.", "Unlike you did, he has a choice about whether or not to be in your home. You also have a choice on whether or not he visits you going forward.", "If your father were a rational reasonable man he would recognize that the words he casually threw at you about his house cut you so deep that you remembered them and used them against him 10 years later.", "You can tell your father that his wife is childish and disrespectful trying to dictate in other people house, that you and your partner have the right to decorate however they want and make \"homeowners decisions\". \nThat if he needs to send you petty texts so often means his wife can't understand respect and boundaries and she needs to grow up.", "Well parents don't get to make decisions about their adult children's homes either.", "Tell him if he pays off your mortgage you\u2019ll put up one photo.", "Actually, the difference is you lived in that house so having some input makes sense. \n\nYour father does not live in your house, therefore he does not get to have input.", "Tell him that you\u2019ll put a photo of his wife in your house when he puts a photo of your mom up in his.  If he wants to claim that it\u2019s different since you\u2019re both adults making adult decisions now he should have no problem honouring your wishes.", "And you\u2019re saying it to a weak-willed p-whipped father. You make adult and homeowner decisions now.", "It is the same though. Because your father can't make \"adult or homeowner decisions\" about YOUR house. In fact, since your father and stepmother don't have to live there, they don't get even \"child stuck in the house\" consideration of their opinions.", "NTA Dude, that sucks-sorry about your mom & your dad's reaction! Reply \"If I'm being childish, what were you doing when you didn't care how I felt when Mom passed?\" Were YOU \"childish\" too-or just being an AH when you showed that how I felt mattered nothing to you?\"", "I\u2019m married to a widower. If you walk into my house and look just to the left of the entry way, near the entrance to the living room, you\u2019ll see an old Victorian era upright piano. That piano belonged to my husband\u2019s late wife\u2019s grandmother before they inherited it. On top of the piano you will find a nice little display of photos of her and their family. In the center is their wedding photo and moving outward is photos of them and their daughters growing progressively older. On the far end on one side is the urn with her cremains and on top of that are some glasswork flowers that she particularly loved. \n\nWhen I moved in that wasn\u2019t there. I did change a lot when I moved in, but I wanted to make sure her memory was never erased from this house she loved so much. If her daughters ever walk into this house and feel like their mother has been erased I will consider myself a failure. Yes I made the house more functional for me, and decorated it to my taste, but part of my taste is also acknowledging this woman who was an integral and very much loved part of my husband\u2019s and their children\u2019s history. \n\nYour father and his wife didn\u2019t do that. Next time he starts on you tell him that by erasing your mother they drove a wedge between you and them. By driving out her memory they drive move your out too. Their choices guaranteed you\u2019ll never see his wife as family. That was their choice. She is not a part of your family because she made the choice not to be. And by supporting her he also made sure your relationship with him was damaged. It can\u2019t be fixed unless or until they acknowledge how badly they messed up, and possibly not even then. They won\u2019t take it well, but you\u2019ll have said the truth, and they can simply love with the consequences of their actions.", "Ah that\u2019s sucks I\u2019m so sorry you lost your dad", "Yes, I think an excellent olive branch from u/CompanyAltruistic694 would be:\n\n\"Tell you what. I'll put up a picture of stemmom in *my* home, if you put up a picture of *mom* in yours.\"", "... YAH I GUESS BUT I WAS TRYING TO BE A PETTY FUCK", "\ud83e\udd13\u261d\ufe0f", "100%. I married my husband when my son was 14 and my husband never allowed a bad word to be spoken about my son's father (although he deserved it, we wanted my son to still have a good relationship with his father). No pictures (of my son and his dad) were taken down. We always welcomed his dad (my ex) into our home when he came to pick my son up etc. My husband and son (now 21) have a good relationship and everyone acts mature and respectful. \n\nI'm sorry you lost your mom. I lost my dad a few years ago and it fucking sucks.", "Good. Both him and your stepmom sound insufferable. \n\nYou were a child who was grieving, and they essentially said \"STFU, here's your new mom. Problem solved\". You deserved all the time you wanted and needed, without people being jealous about someone who couldn't hurt them. They should have been there for you and supported you with love and compassion.\n\nI'm sorry on behalf of actual loving parents everywhere.", "Well there you have it and I don\u2019t blame you.", "It\u2019s insane that you weren\u2019t his first priority when your mom passed, sorry for your loss. After all that\u2019s happened, your dad still haven\u2019t realized his relationship with you is slipping. Once you\u2019re pretty much out of his life, he\u2019ll probably realize he messed up and try to reconcile. And it\u2019ll probably be a little too late. Stay strong OP.", "Yes. I totally get it. And I\u2019m sorry that she treated you this way. Wishing you the best.", "Father and stepmother sound like a lost cause, frankly", "I went through the same thing, and having lived through it, to me it isn\u2019t that simple. In fact I would say many family issues are not nearly that simple. People can have very complex feelings about people and situations. That\u2019s why i inquired as to OP\u2019s feelings toward her. I didn\u2019t say he needed to or had to call her. It was qualified with IF.. and that would be completely up to OP. \n\nI do agree about the father, but as many husbands I have observed he will stand and defend his wife right or wrong.", "Fair enough. As I said, you're NTA and your dad is out of line. I still think you should use whatever useful things she gave you.", "You're NTA at all. I'm so sorry you went through this. I'm glad you're able to be (hopefully, from how you write it) in a better place now.", "OK - that's different. You were somewhat neutral (other than the comments about her \"making it her home\"). I retract the comment.   \n\n\nAnd you're still NTA.", ">Your house that your father is not required to live in.\n\nNot only is OP's father not required to live in OP's house, he currently does not live there. So it's not even like OP is forbidding his father to have pictures of his second wife in his space in OP's home, because he has no space in OP's home. Meanwhile, the fact that OP had to store mementos of his mother at his aunt's house implies that OP was not granted the freedom to keep memories of his mother in his own bedroom.", "Very succinct, concise and logically laid out.\n\n\n\nI would tect this to dad if i was OP\n\n\nNta", "Absolutely! And well played indeed. He is the one who needs to grow up. NTA !", "Definitely send this to your dad, op", "She's really insecure. I couldn't even leave my bedroom door open back then because she hated to see my mom's stuff in there.", ">she never cared enough about you to keep your moms stuff in the home that was also yours.\n\nCounterpoint: she cared enough that she didn't press OP to throw out all their Mom's belongings. Given Dad's capitulation it might have been pretty easy for SM to demand all the stuff be thrown out and she didn't do that (as far as we know). It's possible that Dad was the one that really wanted to get rid of Mom's things and used the excuse that it was SM. It's also possible Dad OFFERED to remove all of Mom's things to make SM feel more at home. We don't know and I'd wager that OP doesn't know.\n\nBeyond this we don't know how SM actually treated OP. Maybe SM was actually a good parent but had one small hang up? It's also possible that OP, traumatized by their loss, fixated so much on it that they resented SM regardless and without ever really giving her a fair chance.\n\nOP is still NTA but we don't have enough information to determine if SM really cared or not imo.", "Can confirm. Lived this.", "Yeah, I'd be reminding him of the latter fact.", "He's like my dad. Zero apologies for any of the many things he said and did when I was a kid, and he will never understand that those things hurt me deeply even now. People like that can't be reasoned with. They're the only person whose feelings matter and everyone else is being irrational. They're not worth the energy.", "Thanks for that. It\u2019s never easy losing a parent at any age but to lose one parent and then have the other try to erase that parent from memory would be unbearably painful. Can\u2019t imagine how hurt OP must have felt", "It does suck and I'm sorry for your loss as well.\n\nAlso, I think it's awesome you guys are so supportive of your son loving his dad. I have seen the mess it creates when parents divorce and basically act like their kids other parent no longer exists. I have seen what it did to friends.", "I try to be as neutral as possible even though I do dislike her.", "I think he was... until he went to college and initially moved out. It sounds like he had mom's pictures and things in his room until they got moved to aunt's place. So I'm guessing once he was 18 and out to college, dad and stepmom made noise about reclaiming his room.", "or show him the post.  I bet he'd love that.", "I agree!", "His wife's insecurity is not your problem, especially after the way she treated you when you had to live with them.\n\nWell handled. I think your dad is upset because you burned him so hard with the truth, but he is refusing to accept that as the truth. He chose her over you. Why would you want a reminder of that in your house? \n\nI would be low-contact for sure after this.", "Imagine how pathetic a person has to be to try and compete with a dead person", "Wow. NTA and I\u2019m sorry for your loss", "I have to stop reading this thread now because this is pissing me off so much. I'm sorry your dad emotionally checked out on you when you needed him most. You deserved much better.", "She's a horrible human.", "There is a full damning psychological hurt to try to make you keep your door closed because things in there reminded her of your mother. YOU are a part of your mother that is rough my man. Good on you for getting out and doing well.", "It must have been horrendous. I live in permanent denial my parents will ever die (I know they will but I actively tell that thought to fuck off) and I can\u2019t imagine being a child and having to process then and even understand it. My cousins lost their dad at young ages (they were 7, 10 and 12) and they struggled massively and my ex lost his dad at 28 and it wrecked him, to have that happen and have your other parent shit on their memory and your pain like that must be absolutely soul crushing. Gutted for OP (and for you and anyone who loses a parent).", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f \n\nSame. Most people shouldn't even have kids.", "All the stuff that fit in my room, yes. Other stuff my aunt always stored but then she kept it all when I moved out for college. It was safest.", "Absolutely 100% true!!!!
