Her family is very tight-knit and every month they have a family get together at my wife's parent's house.  It is always on Sundays because my wife's siblings have kids and they all have activities on Saturdays, so Sunday is the only free day everyone has. They live a 3-hour drive from us.  We always make a day-trip because obviously we have to work on Monday.   Needless to say, it's a lot of driving in one day.  \n\nThe get together is usually just a nice meal and some games, nothing too fancy or crazy.  I like her family and enjoy hanging out with them, but there have been times when I don't feel like going and there's no hard feelings about not attending.  \n\nThe problem is, that if I don't attend, my wife doesn't attend.  She is a very anxious driver, especially on freeways and highways where aggressive drivers and semi-trucks tend to be more common.  She's never been in an accident or anything like that, she just doesn't feel comfortable driving long distances on freeways with speeding cars, it freaks her out.  So if I don't go, she won't drive herself there.  There also isn't anyone else from her family that lives nearby could come pick her up without adding at least 2 hours to their drive.  \n\nLast month we didn't attend because I had just gotten back from a work trip and wanted to use that weekend to relax at home.  My wife and in-laws understood.  This month's get together is this coming Sunday.  My wife is adamant that we attend this one because we missed the last one.  I told her I will go, but she is going to have to drive at least one leg of the trip, I don't want to be driving for 6 hours like every other time.  \n\nThis started a fight because she said I know how much she hates driving on freeways and that's too far of a drive for her to keep from freaking out.  I told her that if she wants to keep driving 6 hours in a day to see her family every month, then she's going to need to start driving at least half of it because I'm tired of doing all that driving by myself.  \n\nI told her that I will be with her in the car and will be a good co-pilot to keep her calm and focused.  Unlike when I drive and she buries her face in her phone for 2/3 of the drive.  I told her we can take it slow and easy and it will be good practice for her to become more comfortable with that type of driving.  \n\nShe is not agreeing to this and is insisting that I drive like every other time because of her anxiety about it.  I am refusing to budge and told her that this is something for her family so she needs to start putting in at least some effort to make it happen.  She thinks I am being a jerk about it and not taking her feelings into consideration and being dismissive of her anxiety.  \n\nWe have not come to an agreement on this yet, but I really don't want to give in.  Driving 6 hours in a day can be exhausting and I'm tired of being the only one to do it.  Especially when it's every month.

It's not fair of her to expect you to bear that entire burden every time to visit her family without driving at least part of the distance, and you pointing out that you'll be there supporting her as copilot is the right approach. I can understand how anxiety makes driving scary/hard for some people, but also, it's really not fair to expect you to be the only one making the sacrifice here. \n\n(That said: have you guys considered maybe going on Saturday even if most of the rest of the family isn't available, and just entertaining yourselves that day or visiting with the family that aren't busy? It might make for a more relaxing experience for both of you if you're not cramming the driving into a single day. It might depend on if her family has a place to put you up or if you can get a hotel/motel/air bnb nearby, but, still, an option).)", "NTA and this sounds like a reasonable compromise! Her anxiety is *her* issue to deal with. Therapy if needed. She\u2019s choosing not to deal with it or even attempt to try to overcome it. Giving her experience driving on the highway with you with her could be a good way for her to build more confidence and comfort in herself. 6 hours is a lot of driving for one person in a day.", "NTA - A six hour drive every month is ridiculous and absurd. \n\nI think this behavior borders really close to weaponized incompetence.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe you're being dismissive of her anxiety but she's also being dismissive of yours. A monthly six-hour roundtrip sounds *exhausting*. It seems like you've been a champ about it thus far. You'll eventually have to come to a long-term compromise, though. Agree you'll only go every other month from now on or something like. It seems like there has been some resentment bubbling about this for a while and figuring out only what to do for *this* particular trip will only be a band-aid.", "NTA. \n\nIf it\u2019s this bad, then she needs therapy.

You're not your wife's indentured servant who has to make a six-hour drive just because she wants to go somewhere.", "NTA. It is very normal to take turns driving on long drives.\n\nPlus, driving on a freeway is just a normal part of operating a car\u2014if she challenges herself to do it she'll get a lot more comfortable.

You're being perfectly reasonable", "NTA. That is an exhausting expectation. 3 hours total driving would be more than I was willing to compromise on once a month but 6 hours total in one day? No. If these gatherings were less frequent maybe but I wouldn\u2019t give up one day a month for this for my own family.

Would it be possible for her to meet them at their home or another suitable point, then ride the rest of the way with them? If so, that could be an agreeable compromise. If not - I'm going NAH anyway. Anxiety  when driving can be dangerous, and there are kids involved that would be in danger. But you deserve the time to either split the drive or don't go. I don't think it's either one of you being unreasonable, just need to find an answer respectfully.", "NTA.  Regardless of this specific set of long trips, she needs to get over this anxiety.  What if you're injured?  What if you have to leave town?  What about other long road trips?\n\nIf you're in the US (and I assume you are given that you'll drive 6 hours in one day), she needs to be able to drive on the freeway.", "NTA. Driving confidence is a life skill (unless you live in a place with decent public transportation).\n\nAsk her this - would she rather gain the confidence of driving on a freeway during calm times with a patient co passenger to support her (ie you), or find herself in an emergency situation that she has to force herself to drive.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is a HER issue that she does not drive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are STILL fine to stay at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSHE can decide if she would rather drive herself or stay at home.", "NAH - 6 hours of driving in a single day _every month_?

Thankfully there were quite a few times he felt up to driving both ways, and sometime this summer when he couldn't be around due to work I started making the drives both ways by myself, and didn't even notice when the anxiety dropped. \n\nIt isn't fair to force you to do all of the driving, because 6 hrs in one day, with half of it being after dinner and a long day of visiting, is a lot to ask of you without her figuring out some kind of way to lessen the load.", "NTA.

Her phone has to be on silent, and you put it in the center console or the door or the trunk or wherever it is so that she can't get it \"just to check something quick\". No books or other distractions either.\n\nI suggest this for 2 reasons:\n\n1. at the very least she's actively talking to you\n2. Being forced to pay attention to what's going on around might help her work on her anxiety. You can even suggest she point out specific moments as they happen that would make her really uncomfortable and talk her through how you navigate them (slow down, change lanes, etc). \n\nWhile I 100% agree that it's a fair ask that she participate in the driving because you don't want to do it, perhaps meeting her a bit more on her side than the middle will help the shift happen faster, and makes the focus be more on helping her overcome her anxiety for this. If that doesn't work, honestly look at some specialty/focused driving classes for her, or anxiety therapist.", "my partner doesn't drive either and I hate it.

Your wife will very likely be able to help out with the driving in 2-3 months and can probably handle driving it herself within 4-6. CBT therapy is very effective for phobia. But, she'll have to want to do the work. It isn't easy.\n\nTrying to fix it by having her drive on the highway is not a safe idea. She will be so tense and keyed up that she'll be a dangerous driver.\n\nI'd sit down and apologize for setting an unreasonable timeline. Her phobia isn't her fault, but it is her responsibility. Tell her that you'd like to help her, but you're aware this isn't something that gets fixed overnight or by amateurs. Remind her that this phobia is limiting both of your abilities to live your lives. And, it will eventually put her in a tough spot. At some point she'll need to be able to get to her parents' when you're on a business trip, or injured, or otherwise incapable of helping. She'll feel so much better knowing that she can get there in an emergency.

It's exhausting, especially if you have something (like work) to do the next day.  \n\nIf your wife agrees to drive half the trip, make sure she does it on her way to her parents' so that she can't refuse to drive home which will force you to drive home as well.", "Has your wife considered therapy for this extreme discomfort?

He is the one changing the rules mid game. \n\nI know I am projecting, but I am wondering if he is the reason she lives three hours from her family to begin with. Did she agree to that b/c he never made a big deal about the drive at any other point in their relationship? \n\nI lived away from my family (about 2.5) hours when I first got married. It was up for debate if we were going to stay near where we lived when we met (college town) and focus our careers looking for jobs in nearby cities, or move back home and look for jobs there. My husband having issues with his family, who lived about 30 minutes from mine at the time, wanted a buffer from his family so I agreed to stay. The condition on that was he agreed we would go home for all holidays and major events, as well as buying a place with a guest room he was okay with my family coming up a few days each month to stay in.  We also agreed to reevaluate moving back home we started to think about kids. \n\nFour years later he always found a reason not to drive into see the family, not b/c he didn\u2019t like them, texted and called them all the time on his own, he just wanted to hang at the house and chill instead. He was always inviting them to the house, but in those years my siblings started having kids, so visiting us became less of an option. \n\nI still drove in, we didn\u2019t fight about it like OP and spouse, but it was a source of frustration. It also made me realize if I wanted to see my family with any frequency, that is without the time having a cloud over bc I was a bit miffed at him, something would have to change. \n\nWhat changed? I was 100% not willing to compromise about moving home before we had kids. If he could not make the 2.5 hour as a healthy 26 year old without the complications of kids, I knew he would not once we had them. I wanted my kids to know their cousins, grandparents,aunts and uncles. Being a close family growing up I knew how much easier family support can make your life when you have kids. I wanted kids, if he refused to move home this would have lead me to think long and hard about our marriage. \n\nThis may seem to be just about a weekend trip, but I am guessing this maybe eye opening to OP\u2019s wife as it was for me.

Many people see their family less often than that.\n\nShe needs to understand that she is now married and accommodating her husband should be more of a priority than accommodating her childhood family.

Obviously if there is a train for the equivalent amount of time OP's wife should do that. But really OP's wife needs therapy and driving lessons so she is self sufficient.", "Let me give you a concrete example.  We live an hour and a half by car from my daughter's best friend.  If she were to take public transport (and I have looked into it) it would take six hours by bus and still end up 30 minutes away from friend's house.  Bus schedules being what they are she would likely need to catch a bus at 6:30 am.  And we live in New England.", "Again, this comes down to where you were at.

How can it get better when she\u2019s not doing anything to *make it* better? We tend to avoid the things that make us anxious, which makes sense, BUT this doesn\u2019t help us in the long run. \nSeeing her family can be a strong reward to dealing with her anxiety head on. I suggest starting small, like you suggested too. You\u2019ve been doing this for awhile so you haven\u2019t been a jerk. And you ARE taking her feelings into consideration - by not making her drive the whole drive every time. Just because she\u2019s not continuing to get her way doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re a jerk.

But I just never got how people can accept that they're just never going to drive, like, on a highway? Or any distance at all? It just seems like a basic function to being an independent human, so I guess I just can't understand how someone could just resign themselves to it without conquering that fear. Like yea when I first started driving it was intimidating but I powered through because I wanted to be able to go places without depending on someone else to take me. \n\nMaybe it's time to encourage your wife to spread her wings. She would probably feel really proud of herself if she realized she could actually do it. And isn't it kind of enabling for you to keep doing it? Because her just not going because you won't escort her there seems like an easy out to not wanting to grow and confront a fear and become a more well-rounded and capable person. \n\nI know people will probably get mad at me for saying that.

Ever while driving? It's terrifying,  and it just builds up so much in your head that you literally pass out/ throw up. Bodies are stupid sometimes. That being said- your wife needs help. That level of anxiety is not sustainable and builds resentment in the non-anxious person. Therapy or anti anxiety meds are a must. \n\nAs a perspective,  I was in almost exactly this situation, and didn't initially get help. My husband didn't think my anxiety was really that bad. I ended up needing him to come get me 3 hours out because I ended up passing out in the car.  I did manage to pull over, so that was ok. He was mad that I passed out, mad that I was so obsessed with family that I'd risk my life and confused about it.  I ended up getting prescribed anti anxiety meds for long term and panic situations. My doctor was able to explain what my brain was doing,  and we worked together to get me back out on the road and ok. Now,  I can take our kid 12hrs away for multi days and I'm fine. He never got over his resentment for my family though, so now kiddo and I go to all the events alone, and it's really ruined the good relationship they had before this. \n\nI really hope you can work together to be open about your feelings, and your wife can at least get comfortable with driving 1 leg.", "I suggest if you drive agree that it\u2019s a phone free drive.

That's not a bad distance compared to the three hours you'd have to drive, HOWEVER, I know that if he doesn't feel like driving down to see family, I will either have to see if family will come get me for a visit OR we wait until he is feeling up to the drive/visit.  I cannot complain about his decision because he has the right to say no and do his own thing that day if he so chooses. \n\nYou should be able to compromise, which, you DID make suggestions to make it easier for you and for her to meet her goal (which is seeing HER family). \n\nIf you want something, you've got to work for it. If she isn't willing to make an effort on her part when it is something that she wants, then she shouldn't get it. I feel like it very entitled of her to think that you should do all the work and not take into consideration how YOU are feeling, then turn around  and say that you're not taking HER feelings into consideration. \n\nI truly hope you can come to a compromise where everyone is happy. Sending love and light, friend.", "This. Go up on Saturday. Why not every other month. Also is their a train or bus she could take instead.", "The monthly Sunday lunch somewhat suggests the rest of the family still lives in or near the original city and only wifey has moved a considerable distance away. \n\nPersonally I can relate to the 3 hours drive away as this is the distance from where I live to Sydney. I will do a day trip to Sydney occasionally but it's a long day. I will *not* do it for any random Sunday lunch.", "By far the best comment on this post, I'm sad to see it being downvoted.\n\nIt's a little too nuanced for this sub, though.", "You bring up a great point.  OP's frustration with driving is just as legit as her anxiety. NTA", "Given that this is the US, and interstate speed limit is generally 70mph, we are looking at 400+ miles every month.", "I visit family almost monthly, and even though it is just a 3 hour trip, it gets old fast.  I feel somewhat obilgated with birthdays like every month, and when not there is mother's day and father's day, and then anniversaries.  Then there there is Thanksgiving and Christmas.  September and October are the two months I can reasonably skip.", "Unless you have a surplus miles or work for the airlines, flying will get expensive fast.  And in the US?  Buses and trains are not the answer even if they do exist.  They are expensive and slow.\n\nI live in Mid MO.  There is a private shuttle service to both the St Louis and KC airports, but it costs $100 a trip.", "She isn't capable of going from no driving to a 3 hour drive, all at once. Let her start with way less and work her way up, with YOU driving the scary stretch until she is way more solid behind the wheel. Sure, it's not fair that you do all the driving. You're right. But what good is being right, if she crashes because she doesn't have a good driver's reaction time and instincts? \n\nIf you'll only drive there every three months until she's able to equally split the driving, that will motivate her to practice. You could drive somewhere about 30-45 minutes away on Sundays, with her driving home, or she could use an adult driver's ed instructor to knock the rust off... \n\nThere's a lot if ways to get her where you need her to be. All at once just sounds dangerous.", "Why don't you select no highway option in google maps  and then let your wife drive one way even if it takes a little longer?. Not the correct way to solve the problem, but at least resolves the fight.", "I used to suffer from a lot of driving anxiety, and I say start small. She can drive from their house to the first small town/gas station/rest stop on their route, then they switch and he drives the rest of the way. Then when she\u2019s familiar with that and it doesn\u2019t make her feel anxious anymore, they can pick a new switch point that\u2019s a little further out.", "I was the remote person during Covid, and found it annoying.", "And adds possible hours to the trip", "I'm cheering you on! I was in the same boat! \ud83d\ude01 And also got back to driving too! On highways with a LOT of lanes! (Which is still scary but oh well).", "Me too! But you gotta work that shit out in therapy. Otherwise you find yourself in the ER with panic attacks. \n\nI used to be nervous on highways too. But driving more and getting used to the highway helped me get over the fear. I have worked out exactly what lane I need to be in at each point when I am traveling to my parents (about and hour away) so that it\u2019s become automatic", "Wait so 3 hours of driving and you're still in the city?", "Hell my sister lives 35 minutes from me and I don\u2019t see her once a month \ud83d\ude02", "If there are indeed buses or trains that she can take, then absolutely.  Or drive herself.  Or skip the gatherings.", "But if she could drive, she could go without him when he doesn\u2019t want to go. It really solves the problem if she just gets comfortable with highway driving", "Not to mention driving while exhausted can be just as bad as DUI. I imagine one is not very \"awake\" after a day of family gathering and games. The first 3 hours are probably pretty safe, I doubt the second 3 are exhaustion free.", "*laughs in Australian*", "If she wasnt married, she would probably live 3 blocks from her parents.", "If she wasn't married she might live close to her family, and not have to figure it out. We can't know some 'what if' things sometimes.", "Seriously! It takes a toll on the driver and that\u2019s not fair.", "If they weren\u2019t married, she\u2019d probably be living much closer to her family/somewhere where she wouldn\u2019t have to drive so far or on freeways. I specifically asked OP why they live so far away from her family, but no reply so far. I suspect OP is probably the reason (ex: OP\u2019s job, living closer to his family, etc), and if that is the case, then he does have some responsibility to ensure she gets to see her family."]}
