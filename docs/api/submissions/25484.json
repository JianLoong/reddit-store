Her family is very tight-knit and every month they have a family get together at my wife's parent's house.  It is always on Sundays because my wife's siblings have kids and they all have activities on Saturdays, so Sunday is the only free day everyone has. They live a 3-hour drive from us.  We always make a day-trip because obviously we have to work on Monday.   Needless to say, it's a lot of driving in one day.  \n\nThe get together is usually just a nice meal and some games, nothing too fancy or crazy.  I like her family and enjoy hanging out with them, but there have been times when I don't feel like going and there's no hard feelings about not attending.  \n\nThe problem is, that if I don't attend, my wife doesn't attend.  She is a very anxious driver, especially on freeways and highways where aggressive drivers and semi-trucks tend to be more common.  She's never been in an accident or anything like that, she just doesn't feel comfortable driving long distances on freeways with speeding cars, it freaks her out.  So if I don't go, she won't drive herself there.  There also isn't anyone else from her family that lives nearby could come pick her up without adding at least 2 hours to their drive.  \n\nLast month we didn't attend because I had just gotten back from a work trip and wanted to use that weekend to relax at home.  My wife and in-laws understood.  This month's get together is this coming Sunday.  My wife is adamant that we attend this one because we missed the last one.  I told her I will go, but she is going to have to drive at least one leg of the trip, I don't want to be driving for 6 hours like every other time.  \n\nThis started a fight because she said I know how much she hates driving on freeways and that's too far of a drive for her to keep from freaking out.  I told her that if she wants to keep driving 6 hours in a day to see her family every month, then she's going to need to start driving at least half of it because I'm tired of doing all that driving by myself.  \n\nI told her that I will be with her in the car and will be a good co-pilot to keep her calm and focused.  Unlike when I drive and she buries her face in her phone for 2/3 of the drive.  I told her we can take it slow and easy and it will be good practice for her to become more comfortable with that type of driving.  \n\nShe is not agreeing to this and is insisting that I drive like every other time because of her anxiety about it.  I am refusing to budge and told her that this is something for her family so she needs to start putting in at least some effort to make it happen.  She thinks I am being a jerk about it and not taking her feelings into consideration and being dismissive of her anxiety.  \n\nWe have not come to an agreement on this yet, but I really don't want to give in.  Driving 6 hours in a day can be exhausting and I'm tired of being the only one to do it.  Especially when it's every month.

My in-laws live a 3-hour drive from us, so 6 hours roundtrip.  My wife hates freeway and highway driving, so I am the one who drives us there every time.

It's not fair of her to expect you to bear that entire burden every time to visit her family without driving at least part of the distance, and you pointing out that you'll be there supporting her as copilot is the right approach. I can understand how anxiety makes driving scary/hard for some people, but also, it's really not fair to expect you to be the only one making the sacrifice here. \n\n(That said: have you guys considered maybe going on Saturday even if most of the rest of the family isn't available, and just entertaining yourselves that day or visiting with the family that aren't busy? It might make for a more relaxing experience for both of you if you're not cramming the driving into a single day. It might depend on if her family has a place to put you up or if you can get a hotel/motel/air bnb nearby, but, still, an option).)", "NTA and this sounds like a reasonable compromise! Her anxiety is *her* issue to deal with. Therapy if needed. She\u2019s choosing not to deal with it or even attempt to try to overcome it. Giving her experience driving on the highway with you with her could be a good way for her to build more confidence and comfort in herself. 6 hours is a lot of driving for one person in a day.", "NTA - A six hour drive every month is ridiculous and absurd. \n\nI think this behavior borders really close to weaponized incompetence.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe you're being dismissive of her anxiety but she's also being dismissive of yours. A monthly six-hour roundtrip sounds *exhausting*. It seems like you've been a champ about it thus far. You'll eventually have to come to a long-term compromise, though. Agree you'll only go every other month from now on or something like. It seems like there has been some resentment bubbling about this for a while and figuring out only what to do for *this* particular trip will only be a band-aid.", "NTA. \n\nIf it\u2019s this bad, then she needs therapy. If she\u2019s already in therapy and no progress, time for a psychiatrist and a switch in therapists. \n\nHer refusal to do anything to help/change for HER family\u2019s sake isn\u2019t a YOU issue. It\u2019s a HER issue. \n\nYou\u2019re right. At least half the drive should be her responsibility, or you\u2019re both staying home \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. If all of the driving falls to you, then you go only when *you* want to go. When you don't feel up to making that drive, you're free to not go. \n\nYour wife's anxiety about driving is hers to deal with \u2014 and it's entirely your wife's decision whether she elects to go without you or stay home.\n\nThat much driving every single month sounds exhausting, and I certainly would not be making that drive every month. You're not your wife's indentured servant who has to make a six-hour drive just because she wants to go somewhere.", "NTA. It is very normal to take turns driving on long drives.\n\nPlus, driving on a freeway is just a normal part of operating a car\u2014if she challenges herself to do it she'll get a lot more comfortable. I understand anxiety is a bitch, but this particular anxiety towards freeway driving \\*has\\* to be impacting her life, and it is obviously impacting yours. She needs to grow up and find ways to get over it.", "NTA - your wife needs to learn how to drive. She is not a child", "NTA - in a relationship it\u2019s about both parties putting the effort in \n\nPoint b) having to constantly drives etches at your mind and your physical health, if she wants you to enjoy these family gatherings with your in-laws then she going to have to take some of the driving and get past her fear", "NTA. It's reasonable to ask her to make an effort so she can attend these get-togethers. Also, I suggest talking with her and figuring out a schedule of attendance that works for both of you. Six hours of driving is a lot, and weekends are for recuperating!", "NTA - Geez, 6 hours is a long drive.  I get the anxiety but she's never going to \"get over it\".  Tell her to fly?", "NTA. You are actually doing your wife a favor, by making her deal with this phobia. Stick to your guns!", "NTA\n\n6 hours is a bloody long drive.\n\nI don't blame you for wanting to share the driving.\n\nIs there not a Bus or a train she could take?", "NTA but has your wife ever sought therapy for her anxiety disorder that is clearly having a negative effect on her life?", "NTA, the only way to deal with her anxiety is for her to confront it... You're being perfectly reasonable", "NTA. That is an exhausting expectation. 3 hours total driving would be more than I was willing to compromise on once a month but 6 hours total in one day? No. If these gatherings were less frequent maybe but I wouldn\u2019t give up one day a month for this for my own family. It is kind of you to agree to go, but your wife needs to work on her diving anxiety or agree to go less frequently even when there isn\u2019t a good excuse", "Info: I also have freeway anxiety so I am admittedly biased. No one should be on the freeway if they're super anxious. If she is willing to try - great! Youve proposed a good solution if that's the case. If the anxiety is truly too much , it's dangerous. \n\n\nThat out of the way, you said that it would be 2 hours out of the way for family to pick her up. Would it be possible for her to meet them at their home or another suitable point, then ride the rest of the way with them? If so, that could be an agreeable compromise. If not - I'm going NAH anyway. Anxiety  when driving can be dangerous, and there are kids involved that would be in danger. But you deserve the time to either split the drive or don't go. I don't think it's either one of you being unreasonable, just need to find an answer respectfully.", "NTA.  Regardless of this specific set of long trips, she needs to get over this anxiety.  What if you're injured?  What if you have to leave town?  What about other long road trips?\n\nIf you're in the US (and I assume you are given that you'll drive 6 hours in one day), she needs to be able to drive on the freeway.", "NTA. Driving confidence is a life skill (unless you live in a place with decent public transportation).\n\nAsk her this - would she rather gain the confidence of driving on a freeway during calm times with a patient co passenger to support her (ie you), or find herself in an emergency situation that she has to force herself to drive.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is a HER issue that she does not drive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are STILL fine to stay at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSHE can decide if she would rather drive herself or stay at home.", "NAH - 6 hours of driving in a single day _every month_? That's insane. You've been married for three years - if you have a small child that will be _unbearable_. Every two to three months is a lot more reasonable. Maybe she can do something with a video chat app instead?", "NTA, having you with her as she drives is good practice", "NTA, I think you're being more than reasonable. You sound completely burned out, she needs to compromise with you on this.", "NTA that's a her problem.", "INFO:\n\nDoes your wife assist with your families things? Birthday presents? Christmas? Anniversaries? Scheduling vacations?", ">I told her that I will be with her in the car and **will be a good co-pilot** to keep her calm and focused. **Unlike when I drive and she buries her face in her phone for 2/3 of the drive**.\n\nSo basically you called her a lousy co-pilot. That petty remark makes me think that your way of keeping her \"calm and focused\" would also involve some degree of patronizing microaggresion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I am refusing to budge and told her that this is something for **her** family\n\nNewsflash: Dude, you married her, **she is YOUR family** and they're **YOUR** family now too. But let's overlook that for a second - *even if you say \"my wife's parent's house\", \"my wife's siblings\" as if they were not related to you in any instance-* she is the woman you love enough to get married, and driving there is something you do for **HER**, not for \"her family\".  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We have not come to an agreement on this yet, but **I really don't want to give in**.\n\nYou could reach a compromise of going there every other month and since you already skipped going last month it's only logic to go this time, but seems to me like that would feel like \"giving in\" to you, because I'm getting vibes that you came here just to see if people could give you arguments on how to \"win\" this fight.YTA", "Your wife probably does a lot of emotional labor for your family.

I feel like you guys need to figure out a solution that works for everyone. I totally get her refusal to just jump into the 3 hour drive. I have driving anxiety and I have found exposure therapy to work but very slowly. I also found I can only have 1 passages, anymore and it makes my anxiety worse. It took months to figure out what worked best. I understand your frustration but it\u2019s counterintuitive to push this for the next visit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thankfully there were quite a few times he felt up to driving both ways, and sometime this summer when he couldn't be around due to work I started making the drives both ways by myself, and didn't even notice when the anxiety dropped. \n\nIt isn't fair to force you to do all of the driving, because 6 hrs in one day, with half of it being after dinner and a long day of visiting, is a lot to ask of you without her figuring out some kind of way to lessen the load.", "NTA. She needs to build confidence, and this is the time and way to do so. Insisting you drive 6 hours once a month to see her family indefinitely is too much of an ask. As others have pointed out, being comfortable driving longer distances is an ability she needs in case of emergency.", "NTA. You are MORE than generous. I wouldn\u2019t make that drive every month for my own family! She needs to be an adult and DEAL with her anxiety directly. It\u2019s not fair of her to put that all on you.", "NTA\u2026 there has to be a way to compromise.\n\nSaturday night dinner, stay the night, Sunday brunch and hit the road back home?\n\nThat way you can see the family in the evening (or just parents) and the rest of the family the next day. Could that work?", "NTA and actually her taking over for part of the drive could very probably help her anxiety. A lot of times, exposure therapy is the best therapy. \n\nIf she starts freaking out halfway through her part of the drive, obviously you could take over and complete the trip or take yourselves back home. However, the more she does it, the more comfortable it will become.", "NTA.  This seems pretty fair and nothing about it suggests you're being petty or trying to avoid the gatherings altogether.\n\nSix hours of driving in one day is a lot.  One thing you might try is 1 1/2 hours each on each leg.  So she can build up to the full three hours.\n\nGood luck!", "So, have you done this once a month for the last 3 years?!", "NTA. Take it from someone whose parents would never drive in a big city or the interstate. They didn\u2019t teach us, so for the longest time I was terrified and had to get over it so I wouldn\u2019t be a burden to friends and family, especially when I got older. She needs therapy and you are more than reasonable asking her to drive when you are there to help. Question though: how are YOU with her driving? Like in the past have you corrected her a lot, or been a back seat driver? It\u2019s possible she doesn\u2019t want to drive with you because YOU make her even more nervous. Is that a possibility? But yeah, she needs to learn. My daughter is almost 16 and we are absolutely teaching her freeway driving and city driving.", "NTA. Your wife is being unfair, 6 hours in one day is a lot of driving, especially if you're doing it on a regular basis to see *her* family. It's more than reasonable for her to do at least some of the driving, now and then. Also, this is a fear worth facing: I'm a lot like your wife, I'm an anxious driver, but if I avoid driving on highways (like I'm tempted to), it just makes me *more* anxious because I don't have the confidence that comes from experience.", "NTA.  I couldn't do a 6 hour round trip every month.  Not happening whether I was the driver or not.  I have better things to do than spend that kind of time in a car.", "NTA.
