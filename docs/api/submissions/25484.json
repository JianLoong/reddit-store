Her family is very tight-knit and every month they have a family get together at my wife's parent's house.  It is always on Sundays because my wife's siblings have kids and they all have activities on Saturdays, so Sunday is the only free day everyone has. They live a 3-hour drive from us.  We always make a day-trip because obviously we have to work on Monday.   Needless to say, it's a lot of driving in one day.  \n\nThe get together is usually just a nice meal and some games, nothing too fancy or crazy.  I like her family and enjoy hanging out with them, but there have been times when I don't feel like going and there's no hard feelings about not attending.  \n\nThe problem is, that if I don't attend, my wife doesn't attend.  She is a very anxious driver, especially on freeways and highways where aggressive drivers and semi-trucks tend to be more common.  She's never been in an accident or anything like that, she just doesn't feel comfortable driving long distances on freeways with speeding cars, it freaks her out.  So if I don't go, she won't drive herself there.  There also isn't anyone else from her family that lives nearby could come pick her up without adding at least 2 hours to their drive.  \n\nLast month we didn't attend because I had just gotten back from a work trip and wanted to use that weekend to relax at home.  My wife and in-laws understood.  This month's get together is this coming Sunday.  My wife is adamant that we attend this one because we missed the last one.  I told her I will go, but she is going to have to drive at least one leg of the trip, I don't want to be driving for 6 hours like every other time.  \n\nThis started a fight because she said I know how much she hates driving on freeways and that's too far of a drive for her to keep from freaking out.  I told her that if she wants to keep driving 6 hours in a day to see her family every month, then she's going to need to start driving at least half of it because I'm tired of doing all that driving by myself.  \n\nI told her that I will be with her in the car and will be a good co-pilot to keep her calm and focused.  Unlike when I drive and she buries her face in her phone for 2/3 of the drive.  I told her we can take it slow and easy and it will be good practice for her to become more comfortable with that type of driving.  \n\nShe is not agreeing to this and is insisting that I drive like every other time because of her anxiety about it.  I am refusing to budge and told her that this is something for her family so she needs to start putting in at least some effort to make it happen.  She thinks I am being a jerk about it and not taking her feelings into consideration and being dismissive of her anxiety.  \n\nWe have not come to an agreement on this yet, but I really don't want to give in.  Driving 6 hours in a day can be exhausting and I'm tired of being the only one to do it.  Especially when it's every month.

It's not fair of her to expect you to bear that entire burden every time to visit her family without driving at least part of the distance, and you pointing out that you'll be there supporting her as copilot is the right approach. I can understand how anxiety makes driving scary/hard for some people, but also, it's really not fair to expect you to be the only one making the sacrifice here. \n\n(That said: have you guys considered maybe going on Saturday even if most of the rest of the family isn't available, and just entertaining yourselves that day or visiting with the family that aren't busy? It might make for a more relaxing experience for both of you if you're not cramming the driving into a single day. It might depend on if her family has a place to put you up or if you can get a hotel/motel/air bnb nearby, but, still, an option).)", "NTA and this sounds like a reasonable compromise! Her anxiety is *her* issue to deal with. Therapy if needed. She\u2019s choosing not to deal with it or even attempt to try to overcome it. Giving her experience driving on the highway with you with her could be a good way for her to build more confidence and comfort in herself. 6 hours is a lot of driving for one person in a day.", "NTA - A six hour drive every month is ridiculous and absurd. \n\nI think this behavior borders really close to weaponized incompetence.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe you're being dismissive of her anxiety but she's also being dismissive of yours. A monthly six-hour roundtrip sounds *exhausting*. It seems like you've been a champ about it thus far. You'll eventually have to come to a long-term compromise, though. Agree you'll only go every other month from now on or something like. It seems like there has been some resentment bubbling about this for a while and figuring out only what to do for *this* particular trip will only be a band-aid.", "NTA. \n\nIf it\u2019s this bad, then she needs therapy.

You're not your wife's indentured servant who has to make a six-hour drive just because she wants to go somewhere.", "NTA. It is very normal to take turns driving on long drives.\n\nPlus, driving on a freeway is just a normal part of operating a car\u2014if she challenges herself to do it she'll get a lot more comfortable.

It's reasonable to ask her to make an effort so she can attend these get-togethers. Also, I suggest talking with her and figuring out a schedule of attendance that works for both of you. Six hours of driving is a lot, and weekends are for recuperating!", "NTA - Geez, 6 hours is a long drive.  I get the anxiety but she's never going to \"get over it\".  Tell her to fly?", "NTA.

You're being perfectly reasonable", "NTA. That is an exhausting expectation. 3 hours total driving would be more than I was willing to compromise on once a month but 6 hours total in one day? No. If these gatherings were less frequent maybe but I wouldn\u2019t give up one day a month for this for my own family.

Would it be possible for her to meet them at their home or another suitable point, then ride the rest of the way with them? If so, that could be an agreeable compromise. If not - I'm going NAH anyway. Anxiety  when driving can be dangerous, and there are kids involved that would be in danger. But you deserve the time to either split the drive or don't go. I don't think it's either one of you being unreasonable, just need to find an answer respectfully.", "NTA.  Regardless of this specific set of long trips, she needs to get over this anxiety.  What if you're injured?  What if you have to leave town?  What about other long road trips?\n\nIf you're in the US (and I assume you are given that you'll drive 6 hours in one day), she needs to be able to drive on the freeway.", "NTA. Driving confidence is a life skill (unless you live in a place with decent public transportation).\n\nAsk her this - would she rather gain the confidence of driving on a freeway during calm times with a patient co passenger to support her (ie you), or find herself in an emergency situation that she has to force herself to drive.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is a HER issue that she does not drive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are STILL fine to stay at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSHE can decide if she would rather drive herself or stay at home.", "NAH - 6 hours of driving in a single day _every month_?

Thankfully there were quite a few times he felt up to driving both ways, and sometime this summer when he couldn't be around due to work I started making the drives both ways by myself, and didn't even notice when the anxiety dropped. \n\nIt isn't fair to force you to do all of the driving, because 6 hrs in one day, with half of it being after dinner and a long day of visiting, is a lot to ask of you without her figuring out some kind of way to lessen the load.", "NTA.

Her phone has to be on silent, and you put it in the center console or the door or the trunk or wherever it is so that she can't get it \"just to check something quick\". No books or other distractions either.\n\nI suggest this for 2 reasons:\n\n1. at the very least she's actively talking to you\n2. Being forced to pay attention to what's going on around might help her work on her anxiety. You can even suggest she point out specific moments as they happen that would make her really uncomfortable and talk her through how you navigate them (slow down, change lanes, etc). \n\nWhile I 100% agree that it's a fair ask that she participate in the driving because you don't want to do it, perhaps meeting her a bit more on her side than the middle will help the shift happen faster, and makes the focus be more on helping her overcome her anxiety for this. If that doesn't work, honestly look at some specialty/focused driving classes for her, or anxiety therapist.", "my partner doesn't drive either and I hate it.

Your wife will very likely be able to help out with the driving in 2-3 months and can probably handle driving it herself within 4-6. CBT therapy is very effective for phobia. But, she'll have to want to do the work. It isn't easy.\n\nTrying to fix it by having her drive on the highway is not a safe idea. She will be so tense and keyed up that she'll be a dangerous driver.\n\nI'd sit down and apologize for setting an unreasonable timeline. Her phobia isn't her fault, but it is her responsibility. Tell her that you'd like to help her, but you're aware this isn't something that gets fixed overnight or by amateurs. Remind her that this phobia is limiting both of your abilities to live your lives. And, it will eventually put her in a tough spot. At some point she'll need to be able to get to her parents' when you're on a business trip, or injured, or otherwise incapable of helping. She'll feel so much better knowing that she can get there in an emergency.

It's exhausting, especially if you have something (like work) to do the next day.  \n\nIf your wife agrees to drive half the trip, make sure she does it on her way to her parents' so that she can't refuse to drive home which will force you to drive home as well.", "Has your wife considered therapy for this extreme discomfort?

First, could you go late on Saturday, so you still have the day to relax and do the driving after dinner? You would get in late, but be able to sleep in and relax for most of Sunday instead of it all being driving. Second, it's there another family member that she can ride with somewhere in the middle that you could drop her off with once in a while? 4 shorter legs to drive for you, but you still get most of the weekend to yourself. Third, would she be willing to see a mediator, counselor, or driving instruction extraordinaire to at least make an effort to become capable of the trip?", "Put her on a bus or a train. She can drive, she just doesn't want to, so she is the A H here to make you do it every month. \n\nNTA", "Have you thought of driving Saturday afternoon, then coming back Sunday evening?\n\nOr, maybe suggest it is time for family gatherings to be hosted elsewhere, like your place for a Sunday.", "What about rotating houses each month so you don't have to drive so far. Are you the furthest out of all the family?", "She needs the practice for the future. I have driving anxiety but find myself having to drive alone to help family with medical care.\n\nEarly Sunday traffic isn't too bad, unless they live in a resort city and leave in the morning with all of the vacationers.

I think you're in your right in this situation, she should work on her anxiety.", "Sometimes people miss the obvious solution.", "Sure. That time doesn't count, as nobody could go anywhere so null and void IMO.

Fucking SIX hours in the car for a monthly day trip?  My parents live two hours away and we seldom see eachother without spending a night.", "Then she can take a fucking Greyhound bus", "I may have phrase it wrong, I meant stuff like Greyhound or Amtrak if this is the US.

I traveled A LOT by public transport and Greyhound. Trains were an even faster option, but they were more expensive.

I still get anxious driving *new* places, but in general, I am happier and more capable.\n\nAll to say, I don't think your wife's driving anxiety is some unchangeable law of the universe.

I have a friend who literally does not drive at all and uses transit or relies on others to drive her.   Are those situations ideal?  Obviously not, but they also aren\u2019t insurmountable.  \n\nMostly I just think it\u2019s insane to regularly do a day trip 3 hours away, regardless of who is driving.", "I agree.", "Exactly, but she doesn\u2019t want to. She is selfish and entitled", "Glad you are an expert on US transportation after spending a few summers here. If you look on a map of Greyhound's service in the US you can see that there are definitely places that are not covered. Moreover even if it were possible it is likely the trip by bus would take twice as long.  There are quite a few reasons why it just may not be practical.  I think OP's wife needs to get over her driving anxiety if she wants to go monthly."]}
