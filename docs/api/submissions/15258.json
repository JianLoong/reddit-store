I'm worried I'll enter adulthood unprepared so every time my parents are out I cook and bake behind their back lol. (My father is just emotionally absent so he really does not care). The one space I get is my side of the bedroom, which I share with my little brother (13M), I treasure the little privacy I get and I become badly anxious when someone invades it. However recently my parents have started to come in my room to \"clean\" while I'm at school, they basically come in and move things around, I've told them not to do so but they don't really care.\n\nIn my bedroom I keep a box of old sketchbooks, I've been saving them for 6 years and I'm always excited to add to the collection; I keep the box jealously because my mother is obsessed with decluttering and throwing away things that we don't use anymore, again I've made it clear multiple times that the box is very sentimental to me and that I don't want anyone coming into my room, I also haven't given them reason to be worried, I don't keep illegal substances or moldy plates in my room, I don't eat on my bed and I enjoy cleaning.\n\nYesterday evening I came home from school and the first thing my parents said was to thank them for cleaning my room, which was oh so disgusting (I maybe had 2 shirts on my bed). I was immediately pissed but went to check my room to figure out if they snooped around, I found a few drawing papers were missing, and when I opened the box my sketchbooks had clearly been moved around. I was fuming but decided to wait and cool down before confronting them because I needed to get my argument together.\n\nThis morning I told my parents that I don't appreciate my boundaries being crossed, that this is the only thing I ask of them and to please stay out of my room, at no point did I raise my voice. My parents blew UP, screaming about how ungrateful and dirty I am, about how I'll never get to move out, how I've been corrupted by the media to turn against my own family and my mother threatened to not pay for college, not a big deal since I'm not american and I can just get a job (edit: without dealing with big student loans, uni isn't as expensive here) but she wanted me to feel guilty. I'm honestly offended they'd think me stupid enough to fall for mid manipulation tactics, so I decided there was no point in arguing if they weren't gonna be productive about it and I walked away.\n\nI'm tired of having my privacy invaded and I'm tired of my parents blowing up for every little thing, but I'm worried I might have been in the wrong, if so please enlighten me, I'll own up to it.

I've no idea why people think that children and young adults have no right to privacy. It doesn't matter who owns the house, it doesn't give people the right to behave like this towards their own children. And the thing with the sketch books feels like a very deliberate power play. That's mean and manipulative. \n\nI hope you can move out soon.", "Definitely NTA. But please hold on just for a little bit longer. I know it's hard ATM but you are almost 18 and while there are so many possibilities for you to move out, arguing or cutting ties with your family won't help you when so young. \n\nOnce you are 18 I'd look into moving into some student housing close to a college you like or just getting a part time job and renting s flat with some roommates. All of this will require planning and hence a roof over your head and resources. So just make peace with the fact that you will not have privacy for a while now as it is still their house and their rules, but you will have it all a bit later.", "NTA sadly I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much you can do until you move out.", "NTA. Your parents are being emotionally abusive.\n\nINFO: just curious what you man- I\u2019m not American so I can just get a job? Nbd, just confusing.", "NTA- but also at this age it\u2019s kind of your parents way. I\u2019d move out when you can, and grow into the person you want to be, as it seems like your manipulative parents are trying to shape you. Best of luck.", "NTA at all - your room, your space! It\u2019s good that you put your foot down and tried to establish some sort of boundaries!\n\nTricky one given it\u2019s your parent\u2019s place, but at the same time they don\u2019t have any right to micromanaging you! \n\nA shame they don\u2019t let you cook etc - I would have thought they\u2019d be all for it! \n\nHopefully you\u2019ll be able to find your own accommodation soon - you\u2019ve got this!", "NTA. I fear the only solution is to move out. Can you do that legally before 18 in your country?", "Honestly you're 17 and it's \"their house\" you can demand it and be mad...

If you have any close people outside your immediate family, I would tell them about how unsafe you feel at home. Are you legally an adult at 18 in your country?", "> I just want to do laundry man\n\nSweetie, you are going to make your future SO very happy one day if you keep that attitude.\n\nYou are definitely NTA. Yes, you deserve privacy. Yes, you should be able to keep sentimental items. Yes, you should clean up after yourself (including laundry), and yes, you are old enough to learn how to cook.\n\nIs there a family member you can talk to about this and possibly move in with until you can legally be out on your own. If not, are there courses at school (or another learning institute) you can take like home economics. My dad took cooking and sewing during highschool to ensure he could \"survive on his own\". Sewing classes usually go over different fabric types and how to wash them (including all those little symbols on the tags that tell you how to wash your clothes).

Maybe ask your grandma to keep some special things for you? When you finish a sketch book, send it to her to store for you. It would be a kind of emotional safety chest.\n\nYou don\u2019t know for a fact your parents will treat brother as bad if you leave, maybe get a job asap and try to get a room in a hostel at 18?", "that's a great idea I'll ask her about it \n\nthankfully my brother has a stronger personality than me and he's easily twice my size so I don't doubt he'll get our parents to respect him, I just want to spend the most time with him before I move for university"]}
