Their dynamic was weird, true, but very healthy.", "Oh I didn\u2019t know they were being sarcastic \ud83d\ude2d but same with me , helps me communicate with others better as I have a hard time feeling awkward in casual conversations \ud83d\ude2d", "The post makes no sense. He wants a maid and the maid seems to be doing a good job but he so much doesn't want his wife to be friends with \"people they pay\" the wife fired the maid.\nSo the wife is desperate for friends and fires this woman! Is the maid even okay with that?", "Looks like we found ops' alt account", "So you still don't get it SHE'S LONELY", "Great, so you are an asshole who hardly knows anything about your wife's life, but want to restrict it anyways. \n\nYTA.", "Oh, so that's why she hasn't left you", "So I take it your parents aren't too friendly with your wife, seeing as she works for them and they pay her? \n\nHow do they feel about their son having married a lowly employee? \n\nYTA", "So, she's busy at work for many hours a week, and doesn't see her other friends very often, so you go rid of the one person she did see regularly?", "The Iranian yoghurt is not the issue here. \nI'm dying. Thank you Reddit \ud83e\udd23", "Agreed. I always have a good chuckle when someone brings up the marinara sauce too", "OP works for his parents company.

And do you have any reason to believe that's the case here? \n\nDo you not think if OP was fine with paying someone to hang out with his wife instead of cleaning, then this post wouldn't even exist?", "I mean, based on what you're describing it sounds like your grandma is paying for friendship. Not sure if I'd call that particularly healthy, but hey, not my circus not my monkeys. If she's fine with it then who am I to say anything otherwise.", "just shows the wife needs company more than the help", "I have a feeling the wife and the maid were in cahoots because the maid had a new house to replace theirs already", "I was just going to say that!", "Have you read what I wrote? She isn't lonely, she has friends already. And also workmates. And she talks to her mother over the phone almost every day.", "By design.", "I hope he's not friendly with his family then, because with his logic, they're his employers and they shouldn't be friends with people they pay!", "It's still wild to fire someone.

I can think someone is being taken advantage of while also realizing that if she's fine with it then it's not my place to do anything about.", "wife fired her so they could be friends rather than him butting in", "Facts \ud83d\udcaf", "Holy moly, we are talking about this specific situation.  If the person who makes the decision is OK with it, they can't be taken advantage of when it benefits both of them.\n\nIf you are just here to be a right fighter, I am not interested. So I will not be addressing this any further.", "Oh I knows why she did it. I just hope she she discussed it with the maid first.", "Sorry, I just don't agree. Someone can be taken advantage of, yet be fine with it, at the same time. Those two are not mutually exclusive things.\n\nThe grandma can be perfectly fine with paying the maid to stay around and watch TV with her, but that doesn't mean the maid isn't taking advantage of the grandma's loneliness."]}
