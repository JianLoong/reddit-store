Did you secretly steal candy bars from shops at 6yo? Did you get a job at 11yo and spend the money on crisps? No, an overweight child is exclusively the fault of the parents (barring health issues).\n\nSo your mum was negligent, and then she joined in to make fun of you. That's *horrible*.", "Nta.  Your mom is abusive.", "NTA, your mother wasn\u2019t parenting you, it wasn\u2019t \u201ctough love\u201d, it was abuse.  Call your dad and see if he would let you go live with him.", "NTA your mom sucks. Sucks harder than most moms. Who doesn\u2019t tell their child they love them??? This whole story is very sad. Im so sorry you\u2019ve gone through this.", "NTA. Your mother isn\u2019t so good at the parenting thing. There\u2019s a right way and a wrong to promote healthy habits in kids. She\u2019s doing it wrong. Instead of shaming you, she should encourage you to eat more healthy foods and probably get you to a doctor to make sure you don\u2019t have a medical condition affecting your weight.", "NTA and maybe time to see if your dad wants to be involved in your life.

She raised you to be a punching bag.\n\nIf she wanted you to be tough, she'd teach you to have self respect and not take crap from anyone. By just constantly insulting you all she taught you was \"you should accept hate and insults and bile thrown at you and you should never complain\". Does that sound tough to you?\n\nBeing tough means being able to endure pain and hurt, but it also means knowing when to fight back, and it also means protecting those who need your help. Attacking children over their appearance is not tough, it's *weak.* It shows deep down your mum is a frightened bully that can only feel better about herself by attacking those she knows are weaker than her. And when called out on it, she continues to make you look small in order to try to convince herself she's tough.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Unfortunately, people still believe that fat people are fat because they choose to be and because they are lazy when there is so much scientific evidence that points to genetics and mental health issues. I\u2019m sorry to say that your mother is a huge AH for allowing anyone else to bully you, and for participating in that bullying. And if you have health insurance that covers mental health care, I recommend you seek counseling from someone who specializes in weight management. I would also try to get in to see acphysician. Unfortunately, all that will require you to return to your mothers house. If that happens, you should make sure that you are fully participating in doing chores around the house. Good luck.", "NTA and \"tough love\" is a lie. If our lives are tough, real love is where we go to be safe, not a place where they make our lives harder to make everything else pale in comparison. Love supports us as we weather tough things, and it helps us face the world by the side of someone we trust (I'm talking any kind of love, family/friend/romantic/etc)\n\nYour mom isn't showing you love, and you don't deserve how she treats you.

First off, I am soooo sorry you are dealing and have been dealing with this your entire life. Your mother and seemingly your entire family is EXTREMELY abusive. Even if you were 400+ LBS, family that \"loves you\" would come to you privately and say they're worried about your health and try to push you to live a healthier lifestyle, not belittle you and make you feel like garbage. You have every right to feel how you feel and you have every right to never talk to her again. I promise that you will find \"non-blood\" family that will truly love you for who you are. It sounds like you already have at least 1 friend that fits that statement. I hope you find your place in this world and I hope you look in the mirror and love who you see.  Your weight does not define who you are as a person. You have a long beautiful life ahead of you and negativity like this is not going to give you that. Break the chain and leave this toxic ass family.", "You're NTA and I hope you can find a safe place to stay permanently you finish your education and leave for good.
