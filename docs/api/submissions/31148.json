{"id": 31148, "submission_id": "17xf4zn", "title": "AITA for doing what my husband\u2019s ex wants and stepping back from my stepson?", "selftext": "My (29f) husband (34m) has an 8-year-old son (Luca) from a fling (Shanna). My husband and Shanna are not on good terms. She and my husband were never in a relationship but agreed to co-parent. However, Shanna got into a relationship with another man, who did not want Luca in his home, and she decided to stop picking up Luca when he was about 1.5. I was introduced to Luca when he was 2 and we get along great.\n\n  \nLuca and I share a strong bond, with me taking on a sort of parental role for him, as he started calling me mommy/mom when I got pregnant. Being financially comfortable, my husband and I tend to spoil him a lot, and his clinginess has reached a point where he checks on me in the middle of the night since I'm now pregnant; the love and indulgence extend from my in-laws to my own family. He eagerly looks forward to Fridays at my parents' place for Grandma's cooking and treats/gifts from Grandpa.  \n\n\n  \nAbout a year ago Shanna pretty aggressively came and tried to take custody of Luca. We were advised to give in to her demands, which turned out to be a mistake, and she has visitation every other Sunday. Every time he has to go to Shanna, he screams and kicks. He just doesn\u2019t want to go, and the one time we went with him, he told Shanne that he hated her. \n\n  \nShanna always thought Luca clinging to me was kind of creepy, so she brought in her mystery \u201cpsychologist\u201d\u2019 who suggested my family and I step back, blaming us for babying him and having zero discipline at home, even though he's totally different with us. My husband got suspicious about his conclusion, and we got our own therapist. We only had a few sessions, but she said our home situation seemed stable and loving.\n\n  \nI was contacted by my sister\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d, who also knows Shanna. She basically said the same as the psychologist. She really went in on me and basically said it was all my fault. I just agreed with them. I\u2019m completely done with this situation, I just don\u2019t have the energy for this anymore. I\u2019m 38 weeks pregnant, the baby will be here any day. I\u2019m just done. Usually, my husband and I do everything together for Luca. \n\n  \nAgainst my husband\u2019s wishes, I decided to do what Shanna wanted and completely step back from Luca as a parental figure. Luca has not noticed anything and is completely fine. However, My husband, in-laws, and family are of course not happy with me. My mom literally comes to my home every day to talk to me about it. I just want to focus on having the baby and not constantly be blamed for everything I do for Luca.

Block the \u201cfriend\u201d, get a lawyer and a proper custody arrangement, go to family therapy or individual therapy if you need it. I\u2019m really sorry that you are having this stress in your life, especially while you are pregnant but it\u2019s absolutely awful how easily you are willing to give up here. If you don\u2019t get it together the situation is going to get worse when there are two children in the home and you clearly favor one over the other.", "YTA. Your Lucas mom. At least to Luca. Regardless of whatever is going on outside of your house, you made a relationship with Luca, and suddenly decided to pull away for no reason (to Luca). How do you think that makes Luca feel?  I can only imagine how hurt he is. Especially if he\u2019s as attached to you as you say. \n\nTo further that, Luca is now going to see you doting on baby and feel like he\u2019s been replaced, isn\u2019t worthy, and/or both/more hurt. Jfc YTA. If you were going to give up on the kid so easily you should have NEVER let him bond with you. \n\nAs for bio mom, and her fiends that are saying shit to you. Take your financially comfortable selves back to court, and get the custody agreement laid out in great detail. Then stick to it. If biomom is breaking it, or communicating with you (herself or through others) take it back to court. \n\nShe abandoned her child and now you have too. Asshole.", "YTA.\n\nThere\u2019s no way that I would let a deadbeat mother who chose a man and abandoned her own child, that I\u2019ve been raising since he was two years old, to come back and dictate to me/my husband, my relationship with MY son. Sure, he wouldn\u2019t be biologically/legally mine, but that doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nWhere was she when he was sick? First days of school?  First steps/words? \n\nI would not step back, if anything I would go Momma Bear on her and not make him go see her if he didn\u2019t want to. He doesn\u2019t know her.\n\nI get you\u2019re pregnant and don\u2019t need this stress, but DO NOT step back from YOUR son. You put in all the hard work with his father while the egg donor was out living her best life. And now she thinks she can just become his mom again after 6 years away? \n\nThere\u2019s a reason she was only giving every other Sunday. Get Luca with a therapist and get documentation that going to his bio mom\u2019s house is detrimental to him.", "YTA. You're failing Luca. Girl, you're his mom. Realise that, no but or if, you are this child's mother. Not the genetic donor who abandoned him for a man.\n\nWhy the FUCK are you listening to these weirdos?! Why are you listening to the ex that abandoned this sweet boy?! Why are you not fighting?!\n\nOr were you waiting for a chance to abandon the poor kid, too, now that you're pregnant? What, is he not good enough now that you're about to birth your \"own\"? There is no other reason to abandon poor Luca, especially because he loves you, and considers you his mom. That's what you are. His MOM. If this is your reason to abandon Luca, then you're a shitty person and a shitty mom and you'll always be a shitty mom and I feel sorry for your son and the child you're about to birth.\n\nPut Luca first, fuck everyone else. you either tell them to pound sand and be his mom like you have been so far, or chose to be a shit human and abandoned the poor child like his genetic donor did.\n\nAnd Luca noticed. Of course he noticed. If you think he didn't, you're a moron and not fit to be a mom, actually. He is probably heartbroken and doesn't even know what to do, he's probably afraid to approach you in fear of being told off by you, since he already was abandoned by  his genetic donor, now he has to go through this all over again. Poor kid has women in his life just constantly failing him.", "YTA.  Don't do this.  That child sees you as his mother and you did too until Shanna reared her ugly head.  Yes, she's his biological mother but that doesn't mean anything right now to an 8-year old that's had you as his mom for most of his life.  Please don't punish him for the actions of his bio mother and her flying monkey friends.  Be the mom you've always been for him - he needs you.", "How have you stepped back if Luka hasn't noticed?", ">I just want to focus on having the baby and not constantly be blamed for everything I do for Luca.\n\nYTA. If you don't want to be blamed for everything, you have to fight for *something*.\n\nLuca's mother has at least learned that.", "**YTA**  You are Luca's mother and you are shirking your duty to protect him from an emotionally abusive bio-mom.   Her \"psychologist\" is a sham and you know it.\n\n> Luca has not noticed anything and is completely fine.\n\nNot true.   He has noticed and he's not fine.   He thinks you are replacing him with the baby and has steeled his little heart.   You are just as bad as his bio mom.   You are copping out on your responsibility to a vulnerable child using your pregnancy as an excuse.\n\nYour husband needs to step up and stop letting Shanna jerk the three of you around.   He can stop the damaging visitations any time and let a court ordered psychologist weigh in.", "Yta. You are using this as a excuse  to focus on your \"real\" child ND push Luca. Just cut Luca has not said anything  does not mean. He has not noticed", "YTA you've been raising this kid, he's your child. Don't abandon him just because his biological mother is a nightmare.", "YTA \nWhy are you punishing a child because his deadbeat incubator is making demands? You are his mom.  Once he notices,  it will only be a matter ob time before someone puts the idea in his head that you don't want him anymore because you have your own baby now.  This is cruel.  \n\nLet your husband deal with the ex but do not deprive a child you raised you love.", "So she ignores her son for almost 7 years and is mad because you stepped up and now wants to be mommy again because she\u2019s lonely or something?  I\u2019m assuming that dude that didn\u2019t want Luca is now out of the picture. I have a cousin who is like this and I can\u2019t stand how messed up her kids are because of her actions.  Fight for your boy because he is yours!", "YTA. You\u2019ve essentially been his only mother for years and now that you\u2019re having your own baby, you want nothing to do with him anymore? \n\nI get that there are other circumstances but that is what he will feel. Especially since he\u2019s not only losing you as a \u2018mother\u2019 but also your parents as his grandparents. That\u2019s a truly terrible thing to do to a child", "YTA, this is a sign of something called parental alienation and interference. and you, virtue of marriage, are a parental figure.  I would encourage you to help Luca understand the importance and benefit of having multiple parents and encourage him to trust you/husband with the visitation schedule of his mother as I haven\u2019t read any significant abuse  or neglect concerns.\n\nNote I really would not call you an a-hole as this is a tricky situation for step parents.", "YTA, and a pretty disgusting excuse for a human as well based on the actions you describe.\n\nThis little boy looks to you as his mom, and you are willing to drop him off like an unwanted puppy at the pound??  I understand you are exhausted - that's what being a PARENT is!!  Now that you're getting a new pet, though, you're just going to tie the old one to a street sign, pat him on the head and walk away convincing yourself that someone will adopt him and give him a nice home..\n\nDo you not see how reprehensible your actions are??\n\nYou need to quit listening to the advice of people who are both uneducated and biased and you and your husband need to get to a LAWYER.  I am assuming you are in the US, and if so there are laws in place to protect this child from the flake of a mom and to give him some stability and continuity in his life. (unless, of course, you don't want him any more in which case you should just keep doing what you are doing.  \n\n(And WTF - you're taking advice from a friend of the Mom??  Why not just pick some random stranger at the mall?)\n\nHere's my prediction - once \"your\" baby arrives, you are going to completely abandon Luca.  You will then look for reasons to encourage your husband to simply grant full custody over to Luca's mom so you don't have to interact with him any more and then you can play happy new family and pretend he never existed.  Never mind that you have F'd up this poor little kid for the rest of his life.\n\nTrust me, Luca has noticed that you have \"stepped back\".  At his age, he may not be able to verbalize it, but he has noticed -- and he will remember.\n\nYes, this post is harsh.  You deserve it.  Don't let anyone convince you otherwise.", "YTA\n\nWhy are you listening to a deadbeat about how to be a parent?\n\nI have no doubt that Shanna is making life difficult but you said you had a strong bond with Luca. He loves you as his mom. And losing you as his mother will destroy him. He doesn't like Shanna with good reason. Stop lying to yourself. Luca is not fine with it.\n\nWith your last line, it feels like you don't see Luca as a son and my heart breaks for that boy.", "YTA  Way to be an itty parent. Get your head together and get a good lawyer and take care of YOUR kid!", "YTA. Luca will blame the new child for him losing his mommy. Why are you listening to people that don't have the best interests of the child at heart and not your own best instincts?\n\nA child cannot have too much love. Why are you punishing everyone because the birth mother is insecure? Luca, for all intents and purposes, is your child. Access your momma bear instincts and act like it.", "YTA. He had one mom abandon him and now his other one is doing it too. And you might think he hasn't noticed, but I promise the caring, intuitive kid you describe has.", "Your response to any unsolicited advice on how you are raising Luca should be that unless they have been court appointed to review the situation, you are not interested in their opinion. An 8 year old is going to act out being left with a stranger who feels entitled to be treated as a parent.  \nI would suggest some counseling for you. You are hormonal now, but don\u2019t let that witch have her way. Remember what is best for Luca. If you continue down this path then you will be the asshole.", "YTA all your showing him is your replacing him with a new baby and your going to cause him real distress. What you should have done is told his mother to do one now she's decided she has a son and carried on as normal.", "YTA!! I'm you but older. I met my boys when they were 11 and 9. Like Shanna, Mabel left for a man. She saw them once a week for an overnight. When I came along 2 years post divorce she hated me! Tried everything to make life harder for us. Then they went after my youngest at the time with all kinds of \"jokes\" and rude remarks. My boys are grown men but they will always be my babies. I am a grandmother to my oldest kids. \nDo not let her get her way! This is all about control. She doesn't care about her son! Change your number and let your hubby handle this circus! Don't hurt this innocent little boy. He needs you to love and protect him from his narcissistic mother.", "I think you\u2019re exhausted both physically and emotionally from the pregnancy and now is not the best time to make this decision. I think Luca loves you and calls you mom and you may regret caving to his ex. Let your husband be in charge of interacting with her. Do you even know if what she\u2019s saying this therapist said is accurate? I\u2019d give a soft YTA if you take away the affection of the only stable mother figure Luca\u2019s known.", "First, I can't imagine how you must be feeling dealing with all that while heavily pregnant. But I'd like to say that this feels like a knee-jerk reaction, one you will likely regret when your relationship with Luca ends up being non-existent or he ends up resenting you for basically emotionally abandoning him to keep peace with his egg donor. She doesn't get to dictate your relationship with him when she literally abandoned him for years. She isn't/shouldn't be your concern, he should. I think he needs to stay in therapy, as kids are a lot smarter than people give them credit for. He may not know exactly what's going on, but he's obviously going to notice the tension, and eventually, he's going to notice that you are keeping your distance. \n\nBe the mom you've been for him, and she can work to build and improve her relationship with him on her own. I'm not saying stand in her way, but you can be cordial, have all communication go through your husband or inlaws, and go about your business. \n\nI'd also document everything in case this goes back to court, she's shown she's not dependable already. Why on earth give up the relationship with YOUR son when there's a very real possibility she does it again when she doesn't have the picture perfect relationship with her kid because it's too hard.", "YTA - You're more of a mother to this boy than the woman who gave birth to him. He's your son.\n\nHe'll notice you've stepped back and he may come to resent you for it.\n\nYou shouldn't give a shit what Shanna thinks. She abandoned him. You do what's best for him. Be his mother.", "YTA\n\nKids are astute. He's going to notice and then watch you put effort into your bio child and be convinced you love bio child more. It will build up resentment. It will cause trauma.\n\nAnd his bio mom will be there saying, \"see! I told you so!\"", "Yta to Luca. You're *his mom*.  You ALL need to go back to court.  The kid is old enough to talk to the judge and tell him that he hates going.  You need to record his reaction to being forced to go and show that in court. \n\nYou need to rando 'miss stick her nose in your business' that her friend fucking abandoned her kid for 6 YEARS and she has jack shit to say to you.", "YTA.  Do not step back from Luca - you are the only mother figure he's known.  What would his egg donor know about being a mom to him?  She's been absentee for 6 years, and now wants to come back and play mommy?  No way.  Listen to your husband, in-laws & family.  They are right, Shanna and her \"friend\" are dead wrong.  And honestly, if I were your husband, I'd document these things and take Shanna to court to reduce her visitation even more.  As others said, what she's doing is parental alienation, and will only hurt Luca.", "YTA  Why would you even listen to the mom? Why are you allowing her to set rules for your family? Do you not believe that once the baby is born the favoritism won't be noticed by him? You are already driving a wedge between the two siblings. Husband should probably think about taking custody of both children and kicking you out. Neither of you are worthy to call yourselves mom.", "YTA. \n\nYOU are his Mom. Parenting isn\u2019t easy! But you step back the second it gets hard? How are you different than Shana? If you TRULY saw Luca as your own you would\u2019ve fought this tooth and nail. Not used your pregnancy as an excuse. \n\nYOU abandoned him! Plain and simple. And he DID notice. And he WILL be affected by it. But I guess now since your baby will be here Luca won\u2019t matter. \n\nKeep this up and your husband will choose Luca\u2019s will being and decide to coparent with you as well", "YTA.  And I say this with 20 years as a step-mom having gone through shitty situations myself.  \n\nLuca needs a mother, and his own has demonstrated she is incapable of doing so.  You love Luca, but you are understandably stressed, and I get it.  I was pregnant with my child in the middle of shitty custody issues with his ex as well.  But the solution is not to step back from Luca.  The solution is to step back from Shanna.  Shanna will not be happy, ever.  She will always hate you for your existence, and now she's punishing you by forcing you to abandon Luca.  This will only hurt Luca in the long term.  \n\nYour relationship with Luca is YOUR relationship with Luca.  Not hers.  Not your husband's.  YOURS.  How do YOU want your relationship to be?  How does Luca want your relationship to be?  Decide that, and go with it.  \n\nAnd you say Luca hasn't noticed.  I guarantee he has, and he probably believes that you are abandoning him because of the new baby, and I'll bet that is also what Shanna is telling him.  \"OP won't love you when she has the new baby.  You'll only have me.  Look, she's already stopped loving you.  She doesn't do things with you anymore.  She hates you.\"  \n\nYour husband, his family, and your family should be shielding you from Shanna.  She's HIS problem, not yours.  He procreated with her, you didn't.  \n\nBut, for Luca's sake, don't do this.  He's going to need as many people in his corner as possible, and he's going to need to know he is loved.  Shanna is likely destroying him mentally.", "ESH except maybe your mom and in-laws (and Luca of course)\n\nShanna sucks for obvious reasons.  She abandoned a child and now wants back into his life but in doing so she's traumatizing the poor boy by breaking up his previously stable home life.\n\nYour husband should be dealing with his ex.  Full stop.  His priority should be, in order 1) his son, 2) you and your unborn baby, 3) him and his family unit.  That's it really.  His ex should not be on that list.  Neither should his sister's friends.  He needs to find the funds for a lawyer.\n\nAnd lastly, you.  I get that you are tired and you're in a difficult position, but this boy needs his mommy, and that is you.  You are his mommy and don't you dare try to pretend otherwise.  He's already been abandoned by one mother-figure, don't let it happen a second time.", "Huge yta when the going gets tough you bailed your despicable and a lousy fucking mom ,", "Wow, you're getting flamed really hard here...and you honestly deserve it. Absolutely YTA. You've got your own baby now and are happy to dump the \"problem child.\" The fact that you're so easily giving in, even with the support of your husband and family, is absolutely disgusting.", "Don't do this.  You have an eight-year-old child who is \\*not\\* the one conniving and making everybody's life difficult, and he is going to be really upset and bewildered if his mother figure (that's you) suddenly doesn't love him any more.  Throw in the fact that you're having a baby and he'll very soon work out that you replaced him and don't want him now.\n\nDon't do it.  Your husband is right, your in-laws and your family are right.  Shanna is wrong.  Love the kid, and be his mommy.\n\nThe AH here is Shanna, but if you do what she wants, you'll be one as well.  Stand up and do the right thing.", "YTA. Life is sometimes hard. That child needs a stable maternal figure in his life. It isn't his bio mom. It's you. This may stretch the situation,  but I hope that when your own child is here, you don't give up if parenting gets hard.", "Are you kidding right now.. you\u2019re backing off from a child you stepped in and raised because of an abandoning mother.. \n\nYTA", "YTA and delusional as well. 'Luca hasn't noticed' that you've stepped back? I call bullshit. He's an 8 yo kid and you're the only mother he's really known. He's noticing. Unless you only started this silliness last night, in which case, give him a day.", "YTA - Honestly, you might as well just get divorced now. Your bio-kid is gonna be your golden child that you put all your effort into and it isn't fair to Luca for him to be around that, you can't even tuck him in at night or drive him to school. You're actually worse that his bio-mom, at least she didn't play mommy for 8 years before dipping.", "Please do not, do not, do not step back from that little boy. \\*I\\* was that child. My bio-mom basically abandoned me, and I was raised by my dad and \"step\"mom. I say \"step\" because SHE was my mom. She taught me and loved me and provided for me. And yes, bio-mom at times made her life miserable. I never realized it until I was older, though. \n\nBut, at the end of the day, her love and support and structure made EVERY difference in my life. We made it legal when I was 19, married and pregnant and she adopted me (no need for the other parent to approve the adoption when you're an adult). Sadly, she passed away when I was 24, but her involvement in my life made EVERY difference.\n\nBlock his mother from your phone. YOU don't need to have contact with her or anyone else who wants to demean you for stepping up for a child. Your sister's \"friend\" calls? Hang up and block her. Your husband needs to protect you and shield you through this. \n\nI KNOW it's a lot, so I'm not going to give any judgement, but PLEASE do not step back from that child.", "YTA.\n\nFor most of the post you were not, but by the end you were.\n\nYou are, effectively, the only mother Luca has known. Stepping back as a parental figure from him is going to hurt him, and he's innocent in all this.\n\nThere might be more context to this, but from the summary written, I can see multiple things you guys did wrong.\n\n1. Giving in to Shanna's demands for visitation because you were \"advised\" to do so. Advised by who? Did an actual family lawyer say this, or was it just friends/family? If the latter, then there was no reason for you to do that. She basically abandoned the child for over 6 years. You absolutely should have consulted a lawyer.\n2. The mystery psychologist. Even if this person really was a psychologist, and even if he was the best psychologist in the history of psychologists - why are you allowing Shanna to dictate these situations? Why does she have the ability to bring over random psychologists and you guys just sit around and listen?\n3. Your sister's friend. Again, you're just allowing a random third person to interfere and give you their opinion. Why are you listening? Why, when you were contacted by this person who said they wanted to talk about Shanna and Luca, did you simply not respond, \"None of your business, kindly fuck off\"?\n4. Why is your sister giving out your contact details to people you don't know?\n\nIt seems to me that a big part of the problem here is you guys don't enforce any boundaries. Shanna is your husband's ex, not yours. There is no reason for you to have direct contact with her. Shanna's psychologist is *her* psychologist, not yours. There is no reason for you to have direct contact with them. Your sister's friend is *your sister's* friend, not yours. There is no reason for you to have direct contact with her.\n\nLet your husband deal with Shanna, through legal means if it comes to that, and tell everyone else who is not family to fuck off.", "Poor boy being abandoned by both his moms. YTA. You are heavily pregnant and tired, but I\u2019m positive you can do much better than this. Once the baby arrives it will only get harder, make sure you talk with your husband and Luca before baby arrives please.", "YTA", "YTA, \n\n>I just want to focus on having the baby and not constantly be blamed for everything I do for Luca\n\nYou have another child. Please explain how Luca will not notice you stepping back when he is so clingy and concerned about you?", "YTA.", "YTA. I know they\u2019re wrong. Don\u2019t give up on your son. Luca is the one who will suffer from your neglect", "YTA. A major AH. You say you love this kid and you guys have a strong bond, so strong that he calls you mom, hates being separated from you and checks on you because he knows your pregnant but you aren\u2019t willing to fight for him.

You are Luca\u2019s mom start acting it again.", "YTA. His bio mom ditched him for some dick. The only mother he knows and remembers is you and you're completely ok with emotionally neglecting him because of some woman who is a stranger to him?", "YTA. You are taking parenting advice from a neglectful parent. She is the last person who should be having a say in how you treat your son.", "If you don\u2019t fight to protect that boy from being used as a pawn then don\u2019t you dare call yourself Mom. \n\nYOU are the only Mom he knows. You fight for him ffs. Shanna and friends have opinions on the matter, they can pound sand. Get lawyers involved if you must, but FFS, FIGHT FOR THAT BOY. \n\nAs a parent we are supposed to do what\u2019s right, not what\u2019s easy. Eff you for leaving him hanging after 6+ years.", "YTA - my God, I am crying for that little boy who has now been abandoned by both his mothers. \n\nYou need to ignore biomom and her friends and so called psychologist. You need to go back to normal before you completely break Luca\u2019s heart and trust.\n\nMy God. You are worse than bio mom if you step back from him for her", "YTA. I honestly doubt you ever felt he was your son if you can so easily drop him like a hot potato. That poor boy.", "YTA. And you\u2019re being played. If you & your husband haven\u2019t lawyered up, you\u2019re also dumb. You need to take the bio mom to court & officially decide custody. It will likely go in your favor since the bio mom basically abandoned Luca for 6 years. And btw, you may not have birthed Luca, but you are his mom & pretty much the only mom he\u2019s ever known. How about acting like it?", "Bio mum is the true AH and a gigantic one at that. She is a literal stranger to luca, his feelings towards his bio mum are absolutely normal, and her problem to fix. \n\nIs he in therapy? I would absolutely get him into therapy ASAP and look at family therapy involving mum as she needs to be held accountable, and if she is found to be negatively influencing luca (which she will) then the therapist  will report it. A judge listens to a therapist, and parental alienation is heavily punished nowadays. \n\nKeep doing what you're doing for luca. Block anyone who contacts you on her behalf and have dad handle any and all communication via text or email only and have him do all pick ups etc. \nIf you pull back now, you will cause him a whole world of emotional damage that will scar him for life. You are his safe parent bio mum has to work to earn her place in his life, if he ever accpets her but she did this all by herself  she is just lashing out at you as she is too selfish to admit she is at fault. \nI also bet if luca continues to act out towards her, she will get bored quickly as she has no desire to fix her mistakes. If she does, then check your states laws around child abandonment. Most are 6 months of no contact. Have dad file for abandonment and step parent adoption, then you never have to deal with her returning.", "YTA and YTD\n\nyou're an asshole and a doormat.

Bottom line OP, if Luca chose you to be his mom that\u2019s exactly what you are and you need to act like it.

My husband and Shanna are not on good terms. She and my husband were never in a relationship but agreed to co-parent. However, Shanna got into a relationship with another man, who did not want Luca in his home, and she decided to stop picking up Luca when he was about 1.5. I was introduced to Luca when he was 2 and we get along great.\n\n  \nLuca and I share a strong bond, with me taking on a sort of parental role for him, as he started calling me mommy/mom when I got pregnant. Being financially comfortable, my husband and I tend to spoil him a lot, and his clinginess has reached a point where he checks on me in the middle of the night since I'm now pregnant; the love and indulgence extend from my in-laws to my own family. He eagerly looks forward to Fridays at my parents' place for Grandma's cooking and treats/gifts from Grandpa.  \n\n\n  \nAbout a year ago Shanna pretty aggressively came and tried to take custody of Luca. We were advised to give in to her demands, which turned out to be a mistake, and she has visitation every other Sunday. Every time he has to go to Shanna, he screams and kicks. He just doesn\u2019t want to go, and the one time we went with him, he told Shanne that he hated her. \n\n  \nShanna always thought Luca clinging to me was kind of creepy, so she brought in her mystery \u201cpsychologist\u201d\u2019 who suggested my family and I step back, blaming us for babying him and having zero discipline at home, even though he's totally different with us. My husband got suspicious about his conclusion, and we got our own therapist. We only had a few sessions, but she said our home situation seemed stable and loving.\n\n  \nI was contacted by my sister\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d, who also knows Shanna. She basically said the same as the psychologist. She really went in on me and basically said it was all my fault. I just agreed with them. I\u2019m completely done with this situation, I just don\u2019t have the energy for this anymore. I\u2019m 38 weeks pregnant, the baby will be here any day. I\u2019m just done. Usually, my husband and I do everything together for Luca. \n\n  \nAgainst my husband\u2019s wishes, I decided to do what Shanna wanted and completely step back from Luca as a parental figure. Luca has not noticed anything and is completely fine. However, My husband, in-laws, and family are of course not happy with me. My mom literally comes to my home every day to talk to me about it. I just want to focus on having the baby and not constantly be blamed for everything I do for Luca. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He needs the love and you have been a great mother so far.", "So... Do you actually want to be Luca's mom or do you only care about your biological child? Because the first thing is what Luca is going to take away from this. The first is what his biological mom will use against you. YTA. Correct your course immediately if you actually care about him. Otherwise I've got to hope your husband divorces you to keep Luca safe from your heartlessness.", "YTA\nWhy are you letting this sorry excuse for a \"mother\" determine how you interact with this child who has bonded with you? Those advising you to step back don't have the child's interest at heart.", "YTA. You are actively punishing Luca because you \"can't deal\" with his birth mother. Tough. You are one of his parents, act like it and stand up for him. Push back against this woman and stop Luca from growing up knowing that neither his birth nor step mother wanted him. His mother left and now you can't be arsed to fight for him. Nice. YTA.", "YTA please don\u2019t turn into one of those step parents who prioritize their biochild over their stepchild, especially when the stepchild in question is so bonded to you. Luca is your son.

Were you a new girlfriend to your husband, I\u2019d say be courteous but keep a healthy separation. At this point you have stepped up and the child has you as his mother figure. You accepted that role. You cannot abandon him now because things got hard (and it is fully acknowledged they do look really hard). As an adult, you need to guide the boy to help him understand the current context and what\u2019s expected of him in its different aspects. Which can be less of you and help him figure out how to think about you, how to build independence and resilience. But you can\u2019t make him feel like a 2nd mom has abandoned him.

Probably one of the hardest things in the world. \n\nBut loving a child and being someone who is always there for them and an encourager for them is never wrong.

His egg donor and that other friend are not thinking about Luca at all they are only thinking about what the bio mother wants and that is doing yet another huge disservice to Luca. He is a child not a doll, she can\u2019t just drop him for multiple years and then just pick him back up again like nothing happened and make demands that will ultimately hurt Luca.

Block her and all her flying monkeys on everything: phone, facebook, instagram, twitter, everything.

Immature selfish people are always going to be selfish and immature, but you don't have to communicate with any of those other people. Make sure your husband is taking the lead on dealing with her and any of her family. \n\nIf you want to step back, there are ways to do it therapuetically, but to just cut him off is not going to help any of you but really will have a long term impact on him and your family and your own child.

I agree with you being the AH but also tell your husband and family what you need from them to be able to love Luca and be his other mom and not have them make you feel like trash.

When the lawyers start calling and want to talk about the whole situation, just block them too who fuckin cares. Why don\u2019t these people get that the block button solves every problem in their lives?", "This is the most sensible and positive answer!", "And they will just find more ways to contact her and it seems like op hasn't told her husband which is another  reason she is the AH", "She's probably doing it on purpose so she has a \"good reason\" to push Luca to the side and put all of her focus onto her \"real\" kid.", "There is no doubt that she is the AH but if you have been subjected to stuff like this before you know that blocking them doesn't always work. They just find more ways to contact you and that is why she needs to tell her husband about what is going on and not just give up and listen to them", "I would put money that she isn't with him and that is why she is back. Once she finds Mr Next she will ghost the kid again.", "Absolutely. Even if he doesnt think so right away, he will eventually. And that is the kind of deep hurt that might never heal."]}
