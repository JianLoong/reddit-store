The father didn\u2019t want to do anything with the child, so she is a single mother. Her daughter, Kate (2yo) a really cute, I love babysitting her, but she is all Ann cares about now. . \n\nFor example she often cancels meetings with friends because of her. I understand that sometimes things come up, but this happens often and she gives reasons like \u201cKate is really clingy today\u201d or \u201cKate really wants to go to the zoo\u201d. And even if she is there, her daughter is all she can talk about. She shows us a bunch of pictures, talks about her sleeping, eating habits, her diaper content, her favorite songs, everything. And while I would be interested inthem, if you don\u2019t stop her, she can literally talk about this for hours. And even if I try to change subjects, the topic of Kate comes up again and again. A week ago we had a two-hours-long coffee meet, and when I asked a server for some water. She said \u201cKate want Kate to drink more water\u201d and then for the rest of the meet was about how she wants to teach Kate to drink more water. \n\nYesterday I babysat Kate, and I stayed there after Ann put her to sleep. We started talking and the topic of being a single mother came up shortly. She told me how hard it is to parent alone and how distant she feels from her peers. I tried to be emphatic, because I understand that being a young, single parent is always challenging. But then she said how people show their true colors, and listed a few of our friends who have been distant with her. She called them \u201cfake friends\u201d and \u201cbitches\u201d which I didn\u2019t like. \n\nI told her that most of those friends wanted to be child-free, and that maybe talking about Kate made them uncomfortable. She dismissed it and said that if they were true friends they would love her kid as much as her. I told her that she is having unrealistic expectations, and that just because her world revolves around Kate, it doesn\u2019t mean that everybody\u2019s too. She got really upset and accused me of shaming her for being a single mother. I told her I\u2019m just trying to point out that not everybody cares as much about Kate as her, and her constantly talking about her kid can be tiring. She got angry and told me to leave, so i did.\n\nToday I woke up with angry messages from our friends saying that Ann is a struggling mom, and I should have shown her support. I feel bad about how I phrased it, but I don\u2019t think that I was being an asshole here. I do understand that Kate is a very big part of her life, and that she wants to talk about her, but I think there is a healthy limit to that. I am closer to Kate than most of our friends, some of them never met her, so it is like hearing about a strangers every little habit all the time.

It was factual and valid.\n\nShe pushed, and is pushing, her friends away by only having one topic of conversation and expecting everyone to be as excited about it as she is. She csn join a mommy group for that.", "Boy, that was a big leap she took from maybe tone down the mommy talk, to being shamed for being a single mom.  They are barely related concepts.  NTA", "NTA\n\nI think you were trying to do her a favor by telling her that when she is with her friends, they want to talk about things OTHER than her child. I mean, I get it. I was a single mom for a while too, but honestly there were times I would go out with friends and absolutely NOT want to talk about my daughter or the mommy part of my life. I just wanted to be an adult hanging out with my adult friends.\n\nThe friends that are blowing up your phone, do they have an issue with her going on and on about \"Kate\"?", "NTA. You're right, maybe you could have phrased it better... but Ann sounds extremely self-centered. Yes, being a single parent is incredibly challenging. Yes, it's ok to need to cancel last minute and take care of the needs of your child, yes, it's ok to talk about your kid (to a degree). If someone does truly care about you and is a good friend, they will also to some degree care about your child. But there is no excuse for how Ann is acting. Being a single parent doesn't mean you get to disregard everyone else's time and interests. Being a single mom is not an excuse for being a bad friend.", "NTA. It was a message that Ann needed to hear, if she's calling her (former) friends \"fake\" and \"bitches.\" She should find a mom's group where she can exchange child stories to her heart's content.", "NTA. It is pretty dull hearing about someone else\u2019s kid all the time when you don\u2019t have any and can\u2019t relate, but the problem now is that Ann has had nothing else in her life and nothing else to talk about anymore, and some parents just suffer from this lack of understanding that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around their child and everyone does not love their kid, you will have to get used to the change if you want to keep the friendship.", "NTA. You were honest with her and defended your other currently child-free friends, and from what you posted it doesn\u2019t sound like you were rude at all.\n\nI was originally leaning NAH because it\u2019s really easy to get carried away talking about your kids. But her offended reaction of kicking you out then apparently slagging you to your mutual friends was an asshole move.", "NTA -  Anne needs to figure out that her child is not the center of the entire universe for everyone else. She has become so narrowly focused that she probably literally cannot see how annoying and exhausting  it is for her friends to never hear a word out of her mouth unless it's about her child.", "NTA, primarily because she's monopolizing conversations (with topics that other parties can't really participate in to boot), as well as bad mouthing mutual friends which is just rude. Your friend needs to learn how to balance being a mother and individual, and realize that her life shouldn't be the focus of every interaction she has.", "NTA, it's unfortunate but she had a kid way before the rest of the friends did and she's out of sync with them. It's pretty common when some friends have kids and others don't. She needs mom friends, which she'll make in a couple years when the girl is in school.\n\nAnd in 10 years those other friends will probably have babies they're gushing over while she has a middle schooler.", "NTA. I was a single mom at 19. I still met with her ifriends and talked about things other than my child. She was always with but we could still have adult conversations. I did talk about her some but not the majority of the time. And now I am a grandmother. Sometimes I talk about them a lot because I am raising them by myself. But again I don\u2019t monopolize the time talking about them. I want to talk about everyone else as well. And she should also want to talk about other things, adult conversations.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to blather about Kate to everyone she needs to join a new parenting group where people actually care about the contents of the diaper.

Its good to give people wake up calls sometimes even though they might make them upset first.", "NTA you tried to have an honest conversation with her, and defend your other friends (who are now mad at you!  Hypocrites).  \n\nIt's not easy for her, but you were not single mom shaming, and it sounds like her world has gotten very small and she really should be embracing time on her own too, and discussing things unrelated to her kid.  But she probably feels like she doesn't have anything else to talk about.", "NTA", "NTA, you \"showed her support\" by being honest with her.", "I'm saying NTA, my best friend is a very very active single father (since high school) and it did cost him some things.  He knows I love his child and will be there for said (now an adult) child if God forbid he can't be; but he also knows that, unlike him, in not a dad.  Now yeah, there are friends that drifted away in the past cause they had more freedom but none of them were false friends.  Being a parent changes things, period, and no, not everyone cares  to hear about children that aren't theirs constantly.  But this really sucks for your friend and you; this is natural diverging paths in life.  You said nothing out of malice, and you shouldn't support \"un-truths\" said about others, but I get why your friend would feel the way she does.

And not saying it\u2019s right but I can understand the need to discuss her kids with her close friends. \n\n\nYou had to tell her the truth. But it is a thing, new moms often get abandoned by friends with no kids. And it\u2019s extremely hurtful", "NTA. These types of single mothers are the absolute worst because being a mom is now their only personality point.", "Erg ESH a bit. Yeah you could have handled that a little better probably and not spoken for other people, her world is her daughter right now and she's probably lost a bit of herself because of it since she's on 24/7 with not much help. She is though for not always reading the room, for calling others bitches and fake friends who aren't kid people. You're right on that.

I'm 32, and child free, but hanging out with my friends now is like sitting in a room full of ALL Anns! This is what being a mom is like. This is what all my mom friends are like.

The children become your attention fulltime 24/7. Their accomplishments become your become your talking points.  You've have to setup times to go out with friends and have a babysitter arranged.

It's also normal for her to be a bit defensive.\n\nUltimately, I think it would have gone better if you had had brought up toning it down a little in a loving way rather than it coming up when she's venting.

It sounds like Ann is feeling unsupported by other people in your lives, so it seems like she\u2019s lashing out at you because subconsciously she knows that you\u2019re a good friend. The best thing you can do is tell her that you never intended to make her feel unsupported, you were just trying to offer advice.", "NTA.

It tiresome...\n\n\nNta", "NTA.\n\nI have always been the one to say something to someone's face, rather than behind their backs, and at your age I definitely lost a lot of \"friends\" to it. You weren't wrong to say something to her, and she was wrong to accuse you of what she did.\n\nHowever, I will say, she is probably VERY lonely. It is hard being a young mom, and my husband was gone a lot at work but was there, yknow? It's very easy to completely lose your identity and it's frustrating and exhausting and her brain probably is screaming for adult interaction but her mouth just keeps spewing kid blabber because it's the main thing she's got going on.\n\nSo while you weren't wrong, please keep that perspective in mind.

But she also needs to be more self-aware of how she is coming off and make an effort to ask about others and not take over.\n\nI have been a single parent without support and at a young age where my peers do not yet have kids, and it is extremely hard and isolating and I suffered depression as a result.\n\nNAH", "NTA\n\nThis woman needs to find a mom\u2019s group, stat, cause her hyper-focus on her child isn\u2019t going to go over for long (clearly)", "It's probably an unpopular opinion here, but I'm going with ESH. You can tell that the friends group is totally different places in life. Your friend is a single mother, and her life revolves around her child. That is expected, and there is nothing wrong with that. Your friend will miss a lot of other events with childless friends because the child will always come first. Your other friends are still young and do not know what it is like to completely change your life by adding a child to the mix. Your friend kind of sucks for saying that those friends that don't stay close are fake, but I think you kind of suck in this one for not truly accepting that her daughter is her main priority. Your post kind of reads to me as you like her daughter but resent her at the same time for taking up all your friend's time. This just sounds like a point in life when people of different stages just drift apart. Might be time for your friend to look for friends in a mother's group.", "NTA.\n\n\nPeople will always give shit for this, but the fact is that just because someone has kids, it doesn't mean their friends want to be all about those kids too.

Something I learned when I was a little older than you is that when someone becomes a parent, it is shockingly common for their old friendships with non-parents to fall away. It is actually pretty difficult for parents and non-parents to maintain close friendships. \n\nQuite understandably, your friend\u2019s world is totally centered around her daughter. You and your other friends aren\u2019t going to be able to relate and Ann expecting you and your friends to have the degree of investment she expects in Kate is tantamount to screaming out loud that she has no ability whatsoever to relate to her old friends anymore. \n\nI\u2019ve lost many friends under similar circumstances. No big blow out like with Ann though. They just kind of fade off on to their own path. When I was younger, I had some bad feelings about it.
