The father didn\u2019t want to do anything with the child, so she is a single mother. Her daughter, Kate (2yo) a really cute, I love babysitting her, but she is all Ann cares about now. . \n\nFor example she often cancels meetings with friends because of her. I understand that sometimes things come up, but this happens often and she gives reasons like \u201cKate is really clingy today\u201d or \u201cKate really wants to go to the zoo\u201d. And even if she is there, her daughter is all she can talk about. She shows us a bunch of pictures, talks about her sleeping, eating habits, her diaper content, her favorite songs, everything. And while I would be interested inthem, if you don\u2019t stop her, she can literally talk about this for hours. And even if I try to change subjects, the topic of Kate comes up again and again. A week ago we had a two-hours-long coffee meet, and when I asked a server for some water. She said \u201cKate want Kate to drink more water\u201d and then for the rest of the meet was about how she wants to teach Kate to drink more water. \n\nYesterday I babysat Kate, and I stayed there after Ann put her to sleep. We started talking and the topic of being a single mother came up shortly. She told me how hard it is to parent alone and how distant she feels from her peers. I tried to be emphatic, because I understand that being a young, single parent is always challenging. But then she said how people show their true colors, and listed a few of our friends who have been distant with her. She called them \u201cfake friends\u201d and \u201cbitches\u201d which I didn\u2019t like. \n\nI told her that most of those friends wanted to be child-free, and that maybe talking about Kate made them uncomfortable. She dismissed it and said that if they were true friends they would love her kid as much as her. I told her that she is having unrealistic expectations, and that just because her world revolves around Kate, it doesn\u2019t mean that everybody\u2019s too. She got really upset and accused me of shaming her for being a single mother. I told her I\u2019m just trying to point out that not everybody cares as much about Kate as her, and her constantly talking about her kid can be tiring. She got angry and told me to leave, so i did.\n\nToday I woke up with angry messages from our friends saying that Ann is a struggling mom, and I should have shown her support. I feel bad about how I phrased it, but I don\u2019t think that I was being an asshole here. I do understand that Kate is a very big part of her life, and that she wants to talk about her, but I think there is a healthy limit to that. I am closer to Kate than most of our friends, some of them never met her, so it is like hearing about a strangers every little habit all the time.

It was factual and valid.\n\nShe pushed, and is pushing, her friends away by only having one topic of conversation and expecting everyone to be as excited about it as she is. She csn join a mommy group for that.", "Boy, that was a big leap she took from maybe tone down the mommy talk, to being shamed for being a single mom.  They are barely related concepts.  NTA", "NTA\n\nI think you were trying to do her a favor by telling her that when she is with her friends, they want to talk about things OTHER than her child. I mean, I get it. I was a single mom for a while too, but honestly there were times I would go out with friends and absolutely NOT want to talk about my daughter or the mommy part of my life. I just wanted to be an adult hanging out with my adult friends.\n\nThe friends that are blowing up your phone, do they have an issue with her going on and on about \"Kate\"?", "NTA. You're right, maybe you could have phrased it better... but Ann sounds extremely self-centered. Yes, being a single parent is incredibly challenging. Yes, it's ok to need to cancel last minute and take care of the needs of your child, yes, it's ok to talk about your kid (to a degree). If someone does truly care about you and is a good friend, they will also to some degree care about your child. But there is no excuse for how Ann is acting. Being a single parent doesn't mean you get to disregard everyone else's time and interests. Being a single mom is not an excuse for being a bad friend.", "NTA. It was a message that Ann needed to hear, if she's calling her (former) friends \"fake\" and \"bitches.\" She should find a mom's group where she can exchange child stories to her heart's content.", "NTA. It is pretty dull hearing about someone else\u2019s kid all the time when you don\u2019t have any and can\u2019t relate, but the problem now is that Ann has had nothing else in her life and nothing else to talk about anymore, and some parents just suffer from this lack of understanding that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around their child and everyone does not love their kid, you will have to get used to the change if you want to keep the friendship.", "NTA. You were honest with her and defended your other currently child-free friends, and from what you posted it doesn\u2019t sound like you were rude at all.\n\nI was originally leaning NAH because it\u2019s really easy to get carried away talking about your kids. But her offended reaction of kicking you out then apparently slagging you to your mutual friends was an asshole move.", "NTA -  Anne needs to figure out that her child is not the center of the entire universe for everyone else. She has become so narrowly focused that she probably literally cannot see how annoying and exhausting  it is for her friends to never hear a word out of her mouth unless it's about her child.", "NTA, primarily because she's monopolizing conversations (with topics that other parties can't really participate in to boot), as well as bad mouthing mutual friends which is just rude. Your friend needs to learn how to balance being a mother and individual, and realize that her life shouldn't be the focus of every interaction she has.", "NTA, it's unfortunate but she had a kid way before the rest of the friends did and she's out of sync with them. It's pretty common when some friends have kids and others don't. She needs mom friends, which she'll make in a couple years when the girl is in school.\n\nAnd in 10 years those other friends will probably have babies they're gushing over while she has a middle schooler.", "NTA. I was a single mom at 19. I still met with her ifriends and talked about things other than my child. She was always with but we could still have adult conversations. I did talk about her some but not the majority of the time. And now I am a grandmother. Sometimes I talk about them a lot because I am raising them by myself. But again I don\u2019t monopolize the time talking about them. I want to talk about everyone else as well. And she should also want to talk about other things, adult conversations.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to blather about Kate to everyone she needs to join a new parenting group where people actually care about the contents of the diaper.

Its good to give people wake up calls sometimes even though they might make them upset first.", "NTA you tried to have an honest conversation with her, and defend your other friends (who are now mad at you!  Hypocrites).  \n\nIt's not easy for her, but you were not single mom shaming, and it sounds like her world has gotten very small and she really should be embracing time on her own too, and discussing things unrelated to her kid.  But she probably feels like she doesn't have anything else to talk about.", "NTA", "NTA, you \"showed her support\" by being honest with her.", "I'm saying NTA, my best friend is a very very active single father (since high school) and it did cost him some things.  He knows I love his child and will be there for said (now an adult) child if God forbid he can't be; but he also knows that, unlike him, in not a dad.  Now yeah, there are friends that drifted away in the past cause they had more freedom but none of them were false friends.  Being a parent changes things, period, and no, not everyone cares  to hear about children that aren't theirs constantly.  But this really sucks for your friend and you; this is natural diverging paths in life.  You said nothing out of malice, and you shouldn't support \"un-truths\" said about others, but I get why your friend would feel the way she does.

I'd, personally, apologize for making her feel bad but not for what was said.", "NTA - her baby has become her whole personality, which is not uncommon!

And not saying it\u2019s right but I can understand the need to discuss her kids with her close friends. \n\n\nYou had to tell her the truth. But it is a thing, new moms often get abandoned by friends with no kids. And it\u2019s extremely hurtful", "NTA. These types of single mothers are the absolute worst because being a mom is now their only personality point.", "Erg ESH a bit. Yeah you could have handled that a little better probably and not spoken for other people, her world is her daughter right now and she's probably lost a bit of herself because of it since she's on 24/7 with not much help. She is though for not always reading the room, for calling others bitches and fake friends who aren't kid people. You're right on that.

I'm 32, and child free, but hanging out with my friends now is like sitting in a room full of ALL Anns! This is what being a mom is like. This is what all my mom friends are like.

The children become your attention fulltime 24/7. Their accomplishments become your become your talking points.  You've have to setup times to go out with friends and have a babysitter arranged.

It's also normal for her to be a bit defensive.\n\nUltimately, I think it would have gone better if you had had brought up toning it down a little in a loving way rather than it coming up when she's venting.

It sounds like Ann is feeling unsupported by other people in your lives, so it seems like she\u2019s lashing out at you because subconsciously she knows that you\u2019re a good friend. The best thing you can do is tell her that you never intended to make her feel unsupported, you were just trying to offer advice.", "NTA.

It tiresome...\n\n\nNta", "NTA.\n\nI have always been the one to say something to someone's face, rather than behind their backs, and at your age I definitely lost a lot of \"friends\" to it. You weren't wrong to say something to her, and she was wrong to accuse you of what she did.\n\nHowever, I will say, she is probably VERY lonely. It is hard being a young mom, and my husband was gone a lot at work but was there, yknow?

You can tell that the friends group is totally different places in life. Your friend is a single mother, and her life revolves around her child.

Your other friends are still young and do not know what it is like to completely change your life by adding a child to the mix. Your friend kind of sucks for saying that those friends that don't stay close are fake, but I think you kind of suck in this one for not truly accepting that her daughter is her main priority. Your post kind of reads to me as you like her daughter but resent her at the same time for taking up all your friend's time.

Maybe your friend is trying to over compensate bc Kate's father walked out. Hearing that not everyone cares as much as she does may have been a trigger. Having an absent father can significantly impact kids negatively.  So it could be she's trying to get everyone to love on Kate even more, so she feels less abandoned as she gets older. While you had good intentions, its natural for some parents to be overly defensive. Maybe approach her again and validate her first.

And to top it all off I\u2019m expecting my next baby soon. The bit of reading I do is always related to something parenting. My conversational topics are pretty much limited to children/family life. But I recognise this and generally make a point of not being super social so I don\u2019t bore people.", "not trying to be rude but damn that sounds hard, like isn't it making you a bit unhappy at least? i feel like your partner should be stepping up a lot more so you get time in the evenings to yourself to focus on your hobbies or even just watching some tv you actually enjoy. maybe they can do some chores when they get home so you have potentially a bit more time in the day to yourself when your kid is preoccupied with playing or whatever kids do. even just reading something you actually enjoy while your kid is playing with something in the same room.", "How can you type that out, and not realize how unhealthy that is. At 2 shouldn\u2019t she be capable of some self entertainment. To have zero personal anything, and be 100% caretaker at all times sounds like you need to find a something for you. Do you not even have personal care you do that you could talk about. I know my friends talk about hair products and clothing selection. Even just food choices. Sales. Just day to day stuff.

That sounds so awful, sorry you\u2019re getting that backlash.", "NTA you aren't wrong about it, just because her kid is her world it didn't mean it's anyone else's.

You don't have to be religious but most local churches will have a mommy and me day so that she can leave Kate there and do things with the other mothers of the group and then she'll form new bonds with other mothers who will also over share. She'll probably see it pretty fast too and will forgive her original friends group. It's just there are plenty of things that she could do that she needs to do not the OP. She needs to do this for herself too, the longer she does this the more aggravated y'all will get with her and she'll end up feeling lonely when she pushes you all out of her life because she feels like she has to choose between friends and her baby. I am so sick of people thinking that not just their world but their kids and everything is something that everybody else has to know every detail about we don't have the time for that in our lives really we don't. Like right now she's doting on her only child but if she has a second child it will not be the same way like forget the baby book barely have a baby shower you're mostly using hand-me-downs and the stuff especially the gender neutral stuff etc. from your first pregnancy. My first pregnancy we took pictures of everything every stage and had over 200 pictures on my memory cards before my husband accidentally lost it on our way to the hospital to have our daughter. So instead of like hundreds and hundreds of pictures of my kids I had like a couple hundred pictures of my first born son a few pictures of my kids together playing when they weren't trying to beat each other up for some reason they're 2 years 2 months 2 weeks 2 days apart and oh my gosh they're both incredibly smart but my daughter is super sporty and my son is just like a YouTube viewer with an IQ of 138. They are both really awesome kids but that doesn't mean I go on and on and on and on and on about them and trust me I actually have their accomplishments to do that with but this woman is literally having to use the content of her baby's diaper you know when you have to talk about your babies stool with a stranger or even a friend that doesn't have a baby at all you need help.", "NTA. You ARE supporting her. You happily babysit and you listen to her go on and on about her child.

That is if you care enough about her to do so.", "NTA. As long as what you said is actually how you said it, then you just pointed out something that she didn\u2019t want to hear - and sadly, it\u2019s something that many new parents don\u2019t want to hear.

I had my first at 20 and I was obsessed with him, truly. I no longer cared about the vapid, shallow and dramatic conversations that my friends were so interested in. They wanted to talk about who slept with who, the latest episode of the Kardashians and other topics that didn\u2019t interest me. He became my world. I started pulling away from my friends.

She\u2019s my bff now and we love each other\u2019s kids and can relate to each other. \n\nAs a side note: most mothers produce more oxytocin (the love hormone) after birth than any other time in their lives. They are wired on a cellular basis to love that child and make their children a priority. Look up \u201cmom brain.\u201d It\u2019s why the human race continues. I understand that some people can\u2019t imagine loving a toddler so much, especially if they\u2019re not a parent themselves, but most Moms love their children an astronomical amount, hence why most Moms opt to put themselves through pregnancy and labor multiple times.

It\u2019s also ok for you to not relate and therefore struggle to only want to talk about her daughter. \n\nI\u2019d suggest your friend try to connect with other moms, even some older moms. I\u2019m 36 but have mom friends that are in their mid 20s and into their 40s. Motherhood can be very isolating; young single motherhood even more so.

Before I had a kid, I had some friends with kids. Since having a kid, some of my friends or my wifes' friends have had kids. And we adore them. Fairly typical for the normal chitchat of a mom to be mostly about the child she's raising, especially as they go throughout different milestones.\n\nNow, it seems clear that most of this \"friend\" group are in different stages of life than each other. Some have the \"I don't want kids\" mentality, and I'd wager others have the \"I'd like kids in the future mentality\". Ultimately, Ann having a kid does change the way these friend relationships work. And it may mean that because most of her life is centered around her child first (as it should be!) it may alienate her former friends who don't like kids, don't really want kids, or are uncomfortable by Kate's conversations. \n\nI can't fault her for feeling alienated, especially since for mothers, being a mother seems like such a natural thing.

NTA how you wrote it here.\nBut you could have perfectly been an AH back then, and rephrased it here to \"win\".\n\nOnly you will know. :)", "INFO\n\nI'm sure the two of you know others with young kids. Does Ann allow them to also speak about their own or just turns it back to Kate?", "NAH.  Unfortunately, you both have taken different forks on the road of life and it is pretty typical of friends with kids to go off in a different direction of friends without kids.  It often isn't purposeful.  It just happens, especially as the kids grow and develop their own social circles which by necessity drags their parents along.\n\nTell her NOBODY is going to love Kate more than her.  It's just a fact. Kate's her child. And perhaps apologize for the way you said things but not for what you said. You are concerned that she stay's Ann and not just Kate's Mom.", "NTA. I don't care WHAT the subject is, no one wants to hear about it exclusively and unendingly.\n\nAnn has a responsibility to be good company to the people she is with. She's not holding up her end of the social contract. If she wants to talk about her kid 24/7, I've seen enough mom groups on Facebook to know there are plenty of women who will share that interest. She needs to befriend them.", "Oh my lawd. NTA. Do not feel guilty about how you phrased it - you handled it so well. You were a good friend and she threw it in your face. Just walk away, maybe she will realise you were right after she loses a few more friends. Don\u2019t forget to tell the other friends what she said about them!", "NTA. For being 20 I'd say you've been extremely supportive, patient and explained the issue in a pretty rational manner. Hell, no one wants to listen to someone drone on about the same 1 thing non-stop, child or otherwise. She needs to join a mommy group for that.", ">And it\u2019s silly in my opinion to say child free folks are \u201cuncomfortable\u201d hearing about a kid.\n\nYes, but it would also be silly that childfree people should just be fine with hearing about a kid 24/7.\n\nSome childfree people love children, enjoy hearing about children... And even they would get sick of every conversation revolving around a child.\n\nAnd some childfree people really don't like children. They don't want kids to suffer or die, but they prefer to avoid being in the presence of a child, and really don't want to hear about 'my daughter this, my daughter that, blablabla'...", "These are my exact thoughts. \n\nAnn has her head way up her ass if she cannot see how good of a friend you have been just because you dropped some cold hard truth into her lap.", "Yet something tells me that if Ann were friends with another parent, she would still not want the discussion to be about anything but Kate...", "Maybe they're angry at you because Ann won't probably ask you to babysit any time soon, meaning they're the ones in the hook...", "Literally you could use that to describe Ann's behavior -- she can have her own opinion without downgrading her friends and calling them fake bitches. \n\nNot even sure where the baby daddy point is coming from. Ann struggles being a single mom. Totally get it. It's hard. But the argument isn't \"should Ann neglect her kid\" or \"should baby daddy be absentee\" -- it is \"was OP TA for pointing out that Ann is losing friends by dominating every conversation only talking about one topic?\" If you want to take this out of the realm of kids, it would be like having one friend who only EVER talks about their dog, uses non-sequiturs to bring conversations back around to their dog, and doesn't want to talk about anything else. I love dogs, and I'd still find that tedious and not someone I'd make extra time to hang out with.", "Its not about what your point is,, its about the aspects you overlooked.\n\nNot having things revolve entirely around her isn't the same as not being supportive. From OP's description it doesn't sound like she leaves room for other people and their interests.\n\nShe should *show* more care for them and their interests and lives if she cares about them. If she doesn't then its dumb to blame them for not wanting to be around her as much\n\nWhat she's calling them out on is not being happy with a friendship that only revolves around her", "Yes, but unlike your friends who get into bitcoin or fanfic, the \u201cmy baby\u201d stage lasts two years, tops. I\u2019ve got a friend who has been ship warring on Twitter over Supernatural for 10 years. The show ended in 2020.", "I mean I wouldn't hang out with someone like that unless\n\n1) That isn't all they talked to me about\n2) I was similarly interested in that\n\nI would relegate them to people I vaguely know and talk to once and a while if they couldn't consider my interests as well and I'd think it would be dumb if they blamed me for that if they couldn't recognize that the issue was that they were only focused on their own interests\n\n2 years is a long while and the length of time that seems normal to fall out of regulsr contact with someone if they pick up some trend that makes them not a great person to hang out with. Not like they all said they weren't friends anymore, but like yeah you don't keep hanging out regularly with people when you stop enjoying it", "Those people don't ditch the friend because she has a child. They ditch her because it's impossible to do something that doesn't involve the child. Because it's impossible to talk about anything else than the child.", "I think there are a lot of logical fallacies in your blanket condemnations of mother baby groups that fall into the realm of \u201cquackery.\u201d  As someone who deals with parents mislead by pseudoscience every single day, it runs the gamut of social groups and is certainly not linked to which parents have joined groups for social support.", "Fair enough. If you're actually dealing with them, then you def will know more than me. I've only heard it second-hand from parents who have come across these type of persons. From those anecdotal accounts, I am not a fan, and my patience has run v thin when I come across them online. Tbf I usually just avoid the convo.", "YTA. You\u2019re supposed to be her village. You will understand if you ever become a mother.", "NTA i have plenty of friends that have kids and while I understand being a single parent is diffcult i have never heard about their kids poops,eating habits, or sleeping do i ask how they are yes do they tell me oh they didnt sleep well last night sure but every detail no. her canceling plans yeah that sucks it doesnt make her a good friend so of course other people decided to distance themselves it happens but she shouldnt be shitting on them because they arent catering to her. she chose to have the child not them. and you should proably distance yourself from this friend if she cant even appreciate that your the one there babysitting and just trying to show her your friends point of view that leave her alone. trust me i did so with a so called friend and it was needed.", "NTA", "NAH\n\nand i'm speaking as a single mother as well. you did NOTHING wrong. yes, there is some parents who think rainbows shine their kids butt cheeks, and then are parents who love their kids , but that time away to talk about literally anything else. Kate can be her own world. but she needs to understand other peoples lives focus on other things", "Is anybody a real assholes here? This is just a natural parting of ways. Her world is supposed to revolve around her daughter now, and that\u2019s how she wants it. She needs new friends who have children.", "YTA, she\u2019s a single mother, her life revolves around her child. It is NORMAL for her child to be her focus and when she spends most of her time with her child, it\u2019s expected she won\u2019t have a ton outside of that to talk about. Instead of shaming her, all you had to do was say that people drift apart.", "NTA.  \n\nShe complained about feeling cut off, and you told her one reason it's happening. If she wants to socialize, she has to understand that the center of her life isn't the center of everyone else's life.", "Ironically Kate is the only one minding her own business and and lives life without drama."]}
