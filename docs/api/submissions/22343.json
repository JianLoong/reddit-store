Since I\u2019m sick they made it safe. It was outside, everyone wore masks, and there was lots of hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes. \n\n\nSince being sick I most days dress very comfy in lounge shorts and a T-shirt. Well, today I did the same thing. Well, a few family members (aunts and uncles and a few older cousins) kept asking why I decided to \u201cdress like that\u201d and that I should put more effort into my appearance. Nobody was super dressed up but I was the most underdressed. My parents said something but didn\u2019t want to get mad because they didn\u2019t want to ruin the day for my grandma which I understand. \n\nChemo messed up my taste buds and make me nauseous. the main things I can eat that don\u2019t make me completely sick are different types of potatoes,  grilled chicken, and popsicles/slushes. Well, all they had that I could eat and not vomit were popsicles so I had a few. Those same family members kept criticizing me saying I need to be healthier and eat actual food. I explained (so did my parents) the chemo has made me not be able to eat a lot of foods and popsicles are one of the \u201csafe\u201d things I can eat. \n\n\nI wanted to yell at them but my parents reminded me we shouldn\u2019t ruin the day for grandma. Well, I held my tongue until I complained about being exhausted and wanting to go home soon to my mom. And one of my aunts said, \u201cwhat do you do that makes you so tired, every time I talk to your dad you are laying around or watching tv\u201d. I finally got too upset so I said well my body is constantly trying to fight off cancer cells while making the rest of me sick and weak. \n\nThen I said so if you guys want to keep criticizing me you guys can experience cancer and chemo and then if you want to keep criticizing me go right ahead. I then apologized to my grandma and walk away. As I was I heard my aunts and uncles grilling my parents for what I said. My parents aren\u2019t upset but I do feel like I ruined the party by saying what I said.
