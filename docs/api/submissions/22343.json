Since I\u2019m sick they made it safe. It was outside, everyone wore masks, and there was lots of hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes. \n\n\nSince being sick I most days dress very comfy in lounge shorts and a T-shirt. Well, today I did the same thing. Well, a few family members (aunts and uncles and a few older cousins) kept asking why I decided to \u201cdress like that\u201d and that I should put more effort into my appearance. Nobody was super dressed up but I was the most underdressed. My parents said something but didn\u2019t want to get mad because they didn\u2019t want to ruin the day for my grandma which I understand. \n\nChemo messed up my taste buds and make me nauseous. the main things I can eat that don\u2019t make me completely sick are different types of potatoes,  grilled chicken, and popsicles/slushes. Well, all they had that I could eat and not vomit were popsicles so I had a few. Those same family members kept criticizing me saying I need to be healthier and eat actual food. I explained (so did my parents) the chemo has made me not be able to eat a lot of foods and popsicles are one of the \u201csafe\u201d things I can eat. \n\n\nI wanted to yell at them but my parents reminded me we shouldn\u2019t ruin the day for grandma. Well, I held my tongue until I complained about being exhausted and wanting to go home soon to my mom. And one of my aunts said, \u201cwhat do you do that makes you so tired, every time I talk to your dad you are laying around or watching tv\u201d. I finally got too upset so I said well my body is constantly trying to fight off cancer cells while making the rest of me sick and weak. \n\nThen I said so if you guys want to keep criticizing me you guys can experience cancer and chemo and then if you want to keep criticizing me go right ahead. I then apologized to my grandma and walk away. As I was I heard my aunts and uncles grilling my parents for what I said. My parents aren\u2019t upset but I do feel like I ruined the party by saying what I said.

Try to  take some safe food and drink with you to chemo .  Nibble VERY SLOWLY and take tiny sips during infusion.   I had a LOT of stomach issues (vomiting) at first but a seasoned infusion nurse told me to try and nibble/ sip every 15 minutes or so  and it really helped.   She also changed the order in which the chemo drugs (I had 5 different drugs) were administered saying that in her experience adding benadryl early and not giving me these 2 chemo drugs back to back should help.  She was also able to add a anti- nausea med once we determined which drug was the main cause of the vomiting.   They are there to help you thru this nasty stuff.

Popsicles were one of the safe foods for my son and dehydration was a big concern. We found flavors he liked and I would make homemade popsicles for him.

If other people don't like that, it is their problem and not yours! You are going through some scary shit right now and dont need the added stress of worrying about how other people think you should be dealing with leukemia.

I'm diabetic and ended up in hospital 3 or 4 times because of chemo making me so ill that I couldn't eat or drink, and as I didn't get a correct diabetic diagnosis until after my cancer was discovered (I'm T1/LADA, so insulin is required), my endocrinologist was still trying to find the correct insulin strength and dosage. \n\nYou're always tired, always just trying to maintain feeling ok enough to not be super ill. People, even family, who have never experienced it just don't understand. Add to it that these relatives of yours aren't with/around you enough to see what cancer and its treatment does. \n\nIf you feel bad about how the day went, talk to your grandma. She's the only one who can say it was ruined as it was her day. More than likely, unless your relationship with her is bad or she plays favorites and you aren't a fave, then she's probably more concerned about your wellbeing than the opinions of a few grumps who don't understand the hardships of cancer.\n\nLeave the stress of this elsewhere. You've got enough to deal with. I came away from my cancer treatments with far more of an idgaf attitude about people like the grumps in your family who complained about you.

The second type made him nauseous and tired, except this time the level of both was so much worse that he spent 2-3 days almost entirely in bed after each dose and could only eat potatoes, bread, rice, and Gatorade for 3-4 days.

Every day everyone has a certain number of spoons to give, and every activity in a day takes some spoons to do. Some days, because of chemo, or complications, or bad sleep, or infections, or feeling tired of being sick and just overall shitty emotionally, you may have less spoons than other days. \n\nNow, think about if you were ranking a list of all the things you care about right now - doing your hobbies, watching your favourite shows, spending time with friends and your close family, etc. How do you want to use your spoons today? I bet you that you have things you would rather use your spoons for than worrying about your extended family's feelings. \n\nIf, after this thread, you are still having trouble disconnecting from thinking about it, consciously choose to dedicate your spoons elsewhere.

I've come to rely heavily on superhuman understanding and comfort...from God. I'm twice your age, so I know that religion and spirituality is not a mainstream concept. But your situation is anything but mainstream. If you don't believe in God, I ask you to consider that now. If you do believe in God, I ask you to consider it more. He is the only one who is with you when no one else can be. And there is some type of strange comfort and change in thinking that occurs when you learn to lean on Him. Many people here will tell you I'm wrong. But many people here haven't been in the trenches with all different people and families with cancer, all experiences different from and yet elements the same as the next. The truth is, dear poster, most people don't know how to react to cancer. Your family is one of many who don't. The internet won't change them and it won't heal you of the experience of being shit on at 16, in a multitude of ways. Often times, I envision sitting with Jesus, asking him what he thinks. Most times, though, I know he's just trying to support me through the myriad of mindfucks in life, helping to keep me accountable, helping to keep me strong, loving me not because of my accomplishments but simply because I'm human. I'm not the greatest Christian. But if I can help you by telling you where to turn, then I've done some of my job. Hang in there. Pray, even if you don't believe or don't know how to. And I'll pray for you, too. \"Do not let your heart be troubled. Believe in God. Believe also in me. I will not leave you comfortless. I am with you always.\"", "Nta. You should have eaten and then barf on them. \"Oops, sowwy, i guess i was right all along and i cant eat that\".", "OP, you\u2019re a fighter and a rockstar. I cannot imagine how hard fighting cancer must be for you. You showed up to be there for your grandma to celebrate her birthday, only to be criticized for something you cannot control. You and your parents told relatives to stop belittling you and they did not. Your reaction is justified here. You are 100% NTA in this situation.

Not only you are so young, but are fighting against cancer.\nI work in healthcare and I've seen people with cancer and people going through chemo or radiotherapy....and I'm soo disgusted by your relatives behavior (parents included).\nThey should use their braincells (if they have any at all), to start reading about what you are going through (and even with that they would never really understand).\nMaybe go to some of your chemo sessions and see other patients that are fighting for their lives, to help them see how luckly they are to not have cancer.\n\nBut putting your relatives aside, I'm also angered by your parents actions.\nTheir child has leukemia, she's understandably scared of the situation, she needs to go through chemo and all the side effects...and what they do?\nThey ask you to be the 'bigger person', and bite your tounge while letting them criticize you?\nYour relatives were the one that ruined your grandma birthday, with all their out of place criticism. They knew you have cancer, and should have know that a birthday party wasnt the right place to talk about your health (and in general, they have zero rights to judge you).\nIf you were my daughter, I would have been the one asking them to mind their own business and shouting at them if they continued..\n\nGood luck OP, I wish you all the best in the world!", "NTA! \n\nYour graciousness in that situation is truly inspiring and a real testament to your resilience and strength of character, I don't know you but I'm proud of you!\n\nI have no doubt in my mind that you will beat this.\n\nThe insensitive and ignorant family members are indeed the AssHoles", "NTA.... Not by a long shot \n\n  F cancer...   My mother is going thru it now and has been on chemo for over a year now.   The only things I can get  her to eat are some soups, and a slushy make from frozen fruits (berries) and  and a berry juice.  I add in a scoop of protein powder to get some protein into her.\n\n Everything else is either too spicy  or too hot.\n\n We have found for family gatherings we have to pack her a meal.  If we even go.", "NTA.                      My nan asked that we cut back on family while she was in her last months. She was living with us and only found out when it was really too late to do much about the cancer. We stayed home through the chemo and her final days. It was a quite time and really showed us who cares and who only makes a show of caring. Only spend your energy on the people who are gonna spend the energy on you too.", "NTA This is  very common and the younger the person is  the more people don't accept the struggle.", "NTA you are a kid and the only one behaving like an adult.

If they did you can bet the others would be more than happy to knock them down a peg. It\u2019s appalling that they treated you that way. \n\nTV shows and movies with cancer patients seem to have put in people\u2019s heads that cancer treatment isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds. When in fact it can be a hundred times worse depending on the person.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you had to go through that what with chemo kicking your butt.

You already have enough toxicity, you definitely don\u2019t need more.\n\nKeep fighting the cancer b*****d!", "If OP does want to go to a function in the future, maybe bring food with you.  My brother did that during his year long chemo and radiation.   We also asked what he could eat and made good broth and then cooked ingredients on the side to add to it if you wanted.

You were a lot kinder than I would have been", "NTA - As someone that's been through chemo, they don't know the half of it. I would sleep 14 hours a day. Food tasted like licking an ashtray. The chemo killed my pancreas so all of a sudden I was diabetic. It also upped my uric acid levels and I went into dual renal failure and needed emergency surgery for that. The whole world felt gray. I would get one good day a week, knowing that the next day, it would start all over again, and the whole time, they were playing with my medication. The steroid booster also made me gain 50 pounds.\n\nI'm going to applaud you for MAKING the party at all. I finally got to the point where given the choice of dying of cancer or continuing chemo, I took cancer. At least I would feel like I was living.

Some people are ridiculously insensitive and don't realize that right now you have to focus on your body beating leukemia above everything else.

NTA!! I\u2019m so so sorry you have assholes for relatives. You wear whatever you can deal with. You eat whatever you can tolerate. Your parents shouldn\u2019t have judged what you were wearing and if they heard your relatives, taken them aside and told them to stop pushing you.\n\nThey kept critisizing. It\u2019s on them.
