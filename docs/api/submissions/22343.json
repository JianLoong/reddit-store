It has been very very difficult chemo is a complete monster. But I\u2019m trying to stay strong. \n\n\nToday\u2019s my Grandma\u2019s 70th birthday. My extended family wanted to do a big party. Since I\u2019m sick they made it safe. It was outside, everyone wore masks, and there was lots of hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes. \n\n\nSince being sick I most days dress very comfy in lounge shorts and a T-shirt. Well, today I did the same thing. Well, a few family members (aunts and uncles and a few older cousins) kept asking why I decided to \u201cdress like that\u201d and that I should put more effort into my appearance. Nobody was super dressed up but I was the most underdressed. My parents said something but didn\u2019t want to get mad because they didn\u2019t want to ruin the day for my grandma which I understand. \n\nChemo messed up my taste buds and make me nauseous. the main things I can eat that don\u2019t make me completely sick are different types of potatoes,  grilled chicken, and popsicles/slushes. Well, all they had that I could eat and not vomit were popsicles so I had a few. Those same family members kept criticizing me saying I need to be healthier and eat actual food. I explained (so did my parents) the chemo has made me not be able to eat a lot of foods and popsicles are one of the \u201csafe\u201d things I can eat. \n\n\nI wanted to yell at them but my parents reminded me we shouldn\u2019t ruin the day for grandma. Well, I held my tongue until I complained about being exhausted and wanting to go home soon to my mom. And one of my aunts said, \u201cwhat do you do that makes you so tired, every time I talk to your dad you are laying around or watching tv\u201d. I finally got too upset so I said well my body is constantly trying to fight off cancer cells while making the rest of me sick and weak. \n\nThen I said so if you guys want to keep criticizing me you guys can experience cancer and chemo and then if you want to keep criticizing me go right ahead. I then apologized to my grandma and walk away. As I was I heard my aunts and uncles grilling my parents for what I said. My parents aren\u2019t upset but I do feel like I ruined the party by saying what I said.

But in order to show her relatives that she appreciates their inconveniencing themselves for her, you're arguing that she has to wear uncomfortable (hot, scratchy, constrictive) clothes so she can look nice?

Wearing super thin piece of cloth across their face and using hand sanitizer so as to reduce the health risk for their severely immunocompromised younger relative is a *significant* sacrifice on their part?
