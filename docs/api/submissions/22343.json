Since I\u2019m sick they made it safe. It was outside, everyone wore masks, and there was lots of hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes. \n\n\nSince being sick I most days dress very comfy in lounge shorts and a T-shirt. Well, today I did the same thing. Well, a few family members (aunts and uncles and a few older cousins) kept asking why I decided to \u201cdress like that\u201d and that I should put more effort into my appearance. Nobody was super dressed up but I was the most underdressed. My parents said something but didn\u2019t want to get mad because they didn\u2019t want to ruin the day for my grandma which I understand. \n\nChemo messed up my taste buds and make me nauseous. the main things I can eat that don\u2019t make me completely sick are different types of potatoes,  grilled chicken, and popsicles/slushes. Well, all they had that I could eat and not vomit were popsicles so I had a few. Those same family members kept criticizing me saying I need to be healthier and eat actual food. I explained (so did my parents) the chemo has made me not be able to eat a lot of foods and popsicles are one of the \u201csafe\u201d things I can eat. \n\n\nI wanted to yell at them but my parents reminded me we shouldn\u2019t ruin the day for grandma. Well, I held my tongue until I complained about being exhausted and wanting to go home soon to my mom. And one of my aunts said, \u201cwhat do you do that makes you so tired, every time I talk to your dad you are laying around or watching tv\u201d. I finally got too upset so I said well my body is constantly trying to fight off cancer cells while making the rest of me sick and weak. \n\nThen I said so if you guys want to keep criticizing me you guys can experience cancer and chemo and then if you want to keep criticizing me go right ahead. I then apologized to my grandma and walk away. As I was I heard my aunts and uncles grilling my parents for what I said. My parents aren\u2019t upset but I do feel like I ruined the party by saying what I said.

Try to  take some safe food and drink with you to chemo .  Nibble VERY SLOWLY and take tiny sips during infusion.   I had a LOT of stomach issues (vomiting) at first but a seasoned infusion nurse told me to try and nibble/ sip every 15 minutes or so  and it really helped.   She also changed the order in which the chemo drugs (I had 5 different drugs) were administered saying that in her experience adding benadryl early and not giving me these 2 chemo drugs back to back should help.  She was also able to add a anti- nausea med once we determined which drug was the main cause of the vomiting.   They are there to help you thru this nasty stuff.

Terrible!", "NTA. You didn\u2019t ruin anything. I\u2019m hoping you don\u2019t have to spend much time with these people. Do they not understand what cancer is or the fact that the treatment for it is literally poison? If anyone had said this to my kid while they were dealing with chemo they would have been told to get over themselves and not very nicely either. Though I do understand your parents not wanting to ruin your grandmother\u2019s day and I\u2019m sure they had a \u201cnice\u201d conversation with the relatives that were inconsiderate of what you\u2019re going through. \n\n    I completely understand the issues that you have with food. Popsicles were one of the safe foods for my son and dehydration was a big concern. We found flavors he liked and I would make homemade popsicles for him. He could eat them and it helped with the dehydration risk. Just a suggestion cause he had days where even water wouldn\u2019t sit right but he could handle popsicle. Stay strong and please try to ignore the toxicity of people. I wish you all the best.", "Are your relatives stupid? Do they not understand what chemotherapy is? They need a straight up come to Jesus moment. Good luck for your treatment xx", "NTA, whatsoever. My mom had cancer. She usually pretended to be healthier than she was to make other people more comfortable around her. It frustrated me beyond belief on her behalf. If you feel bad, it's okay to let people know you feel bad. Either by verbally telling them or just laying around all day doing absolutely nothing and eating popsicles. If other people don't like that, it is their problem and not yours! You are going through some scary shit right now and dont need the added stress of worrying about how other people think you should be dealing with leukemia. Them even bringing that stuff up with you is beyond toxic. Maybe try distancing yourself from these people, if you can. I'm sorry you are going through this.", "I went into this with an open mind cause their are definitely some sick people who use their sickness for AH behaviour and it's not okay. This AIN'T it.  NTA by a mile. Wtf. People with the flu make less effort than you. Good luck on your fight.", "NTA at all, darling girl. You're literally fighting a killer disease and they're choosing to tear you down. You were totally right to stand up to them. You didn't ruin the party; their thoughtless and cruel words did. \nWishing you a very speedy recovery and lots and lots of love and light. I hope your taste buds come back and you have the *best* meal of your life soon!!!xxxxx", "NTA my dad had cancer recently and I've seen the toll it took on his body so fuck them it's they who are the assholes not you.", "NTA. \n\n\nYou're young and female, two counts against you in their eyes that makes you someone they think they can boss around. No wonder women of the middle ages \"had the vapours\" to get away from people like that. \n\n\n\nThey probably expected you to put up a polite pretense so they don't have to give you sympathy.\n\n\n\"oh I'm ever so sorry my cancer is such an incovenience for you! Here, let me just pick myself up by the bootstraps and paste a smile on so you feel better about yourself\"", "**\"What do you do that makes you so tired?\"\n\n\"Chemo.\"**\n\nNTA and please don't bother with those people. They're completely ridiculous. Let your grandma know you love her, ignore everyone else and their total lack of common sense, and just keep getting through the day. If shorts and a t-shirt are best for your burning, tingling skin, wear the t-shirt and shorts. Maderma soap really helped with the awful skin sensitivity when my sibling was going through chemo. Maybe you'll get some relief with it. Hug your parents, get some rest and I hope tomorrow is a much better day. \n\nNTA, and fuck cancer.", "OP, so NTA! \n\nI'm a cancer survivor, 3.5 years cancer free now. Chemo sucked! I'm diabetic and ended up in hospital 3 or 4 times because of chemo making me so ill that I couldn't eat or drink, and as I didn't get a correct diabetic diagnosis until after my cancer was discovered (I'm T1/LADA, so insulin is required), my endocrinologist was still trying to find the correct insulin strength and dosage. \n\nYou're always tired, always just trying to maintain feeling ok enough to not be super ill. People, even family, who have never experienced it just don't understand. Add to it that these relatives of yours aren't with/around you enough to see what cancer and its treatment does. \n\nIf you feel bad about how the day went, talk to your grandma. She's the only one who can say it was ruined as it was her day. More than likely, unless your relationship with her is bad or she plays favorites and you aren't a fave, then she's probably more concerned about your wellbeing than the opinions of a few grumps who don't understand the hardships of cancer.\n\nLeave the stress of this elsewhere. You've got enough to deal with. I came away from my cancer treatments with far more of an idgaf attitude about people like the grumps in your family who complained about you. FYI, I'm sure these same people would've complained if you hadn't shown up either, even if you'd have been in hospital (I have \"family\" like that, too.)\n\nYou do you, rest, leave stress out as much as possible, focus on healing and getting better and embracing life. \n\nSending you hugs and healing vibes! May you get to and stay cancer-free very soon!", "Man seriously fuck your extended family. If you were in my family I'd be happy that you even came. \n\nThey should be a lot more sensitive to what you're going through currently. Again, fuck then with an old rusty iron dildo.\n\nHope you beat that shit", "NTA. As a survivor of a whole bunch of health problems over the years, I've told people the same thing. When you've walked a mile in someone else's shoes, _**then and only then**_ can you criticize them or complain about what they do/don't do.", "NTA some of my siblings treated my son badly before he was diagnosed with his ASD because they read his difficulties communicating and his clothing choices as 'being an AH' and he was 11 at the time.  It was heart breaking to watch.  your aunts and uncles are AHs,  I hope you heal well and get past this quickly.", "Until quite recently (really the late 1980s) in the US, in many parts of the culture and many parts of the country, cancer was considered shameful and unmentionable. It was pretty disgusting. People with cancer were supposed \u2018put up a front\u2019 and then be hidden away to die.", "NTA \n\nYou said your piece and it needed to be said.  You were kind to your grandma and apologized if your words made her uncomfortable.  I just want to add that I'm happy your parents are firmly supportive of you.", "Sounds like a bunch of people about to get cut out of your life until they apologize.\n\nOr send them a video of times when it's at its worst. Then ask them if it's such a walk in the park.", "Chemo\u2019s a goddamn monster.  Fuck those assholes trying to make you feel like you need to cater to their feelings", "Omg. Chemo is very hard on your body! I'm so sorry for what you're going through. - Definitely NTA", "NTA and I'm proud of how strong you had got, will be eagerly waiting for the news when you defeat cancer too.", "NTA. Your family are massive A's and your parents should grow a spine and be actively advocating for you here. Pathetic patenting", "NTA and WTF. All of it is terrible, but not understanding why you would be tired I just\u2014 you are the child and they are supposed to be the adults. How absolutely horrific. You did great.", "Ruining you own day so someone else has a good day.", "NTA \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNothing wrong with what you said.\n\nGuarantee they'd be singing a different tune if they walked a mile in your shoes.  \n\nGet well soon!", "Fake", "Oh sweetheart, I am so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this horrible beast that is cancer, let along such selfish and horrible family who clearly don\u2019t give a damn or understand just how taxing chemo is on you and your body. If anything you\u2019re a goddamn hero for even attending in the first place !! \nI\u2019m hope to hell your parents cut those awful family members out of your life and prevent them from having any contact with you. \n\nI hope treatment is successful and you get to restart a fresh new lift without this awful people around you \u2764\ufe0f", "I would've love to have the OP throw up on them. Insensitive bastards.", "My grandmother got angry at my father for never visiting anymore. When he had lung cancer. During the pandemic.\n\nBut then, this is the woman criticising his choice of music for his own funeral because \"none of the songs are in Dutch, she wouldn't be able to understand any of them!\"", "People treat mental health like this all the time but this is the first time I am seeing someone treat physical illness like this.", "Just want to say. Good Luck and stay strong and beat this thing.", "I\u2019ve been in your (similar) shoes with more than insensitive family members.  For what it\u2019s worth,  no\u2026 they will never understand what it\u2019s like unless they have the misfortune to experience it themselves. \n\nSupport groups with similar people and similar problems is where it\u2019s at for you.", "You are NTA and I\u2019m sorry those relatives seem to lack empathy. Either that or they\u2019re not bright enough to understand what chemo does to your body, I\u2019ve watched several relatives go through that hell and never even considered questioning their sweat pants at Christmas or the box of crackers the brought because the couldn\u2019t eat much else. I even, as a 11 year old, let my aunt borrow my room to nap in the middle of a bbq because she was exhausted, and I offered my bed to her without being asked because I could see she was tired. What is wrong with these people? I sincerely hope grandma understands and scolded them like children.", "Sending hugs to you! NTA!!!", "You\u2019re a girl. Of course, that\u2019s what they think. Girls aren\u2019t supposed to be visibly sick. We\u2019re supposed to pretend we\u2019re fine when we\u2019re not.\n\nI hope you kick cancer\u2019s ass. NTA", "I know its kinda irrelevant but towards the end of my mums battle (before she passed, different cancer) she gave up on brushing her teeth because the toothpaste was triggering her nausea (her thought process was why continue making herself sick when it no longer mattered).\n\nWhile I was pregnant I had the same issue with toothpaste (all three pregnancies) and ended up discovering that the kids \"milk toothpaste\" was tolerable during my last pregnancy. \n\nJust thought I would recommend giving it (kids/baby toithpaste) a try if you end up in a similar situation cause cancer sucks (understatement of the millennia) but it doesnt have to control every aspect and sometimes the little winnable battles helped my mums mental state according to my grandmother.\n\nOh and your NTA, and you were right, and they were warned, they ruined the party, not you.", "FWIW, I *only* meet with doctors in non-exam spaces; they\u2019ve repeatedly proven they can\u2019t be trusted in a space where they believe they have the right to touch others. You can request this when you make the appointment.", "Don't blame yourself for that at all. My dad had 2 types of chemo. With the first one he was tired and nauseous, which meant he reduced his activity, started taking afternoon naps, and stopped eating spicy food or milk products. The second type made him nauseous and tired, except this time the level of both was so much worse that he spent 2-3 days almost entirely in bed after each dose and could only eat potatoes, bread, rice, and Gatorade for 3-4 days. Each type of drug and round is going to make your body react a little different and that's totally normal. You absolutely should do things you like to do when you have the energy to do them and when you don't you absolutely should let yourself rest. \n\nThis is an idea from disability literature but you can think of yourself as having \"spoonfuls\" or \"spoons\" of energy. Every day everyone has a certain number of spoons to give, and every activity in a day takes some spoons to do. Some days, because of chemo, or complications, or bad sleep, or infections, or feeling tired of being sick and just overall shitty emotionally, you may have less spoons than other days. \n\nNow, think about if you were ranking a list of all the things you care about right now - doing your hobbies, watching your favourite shows, spending time with friends and your close family, etc. How do you want to use your spoons today? I bet you that you have things you would rather use your spoons for than worrying about your extended family's feelings. \n\nIf, after this thread, you are still having trouble disconnecting from thinking about it, consciously choose to dedicate your spoons elsewhere. Put on a show you love. Call up a friend. Talk to your parents about something. Read a book. Watch a YouTube video about a hobby you would like to pick up. Etc.", "Keep fighting the good fight and focus on the important things in life, like beating cancer. Your extended family sounds insufferable, but at least now you know clearly what is in their hearts. Maybe next time you see your grandma give her a hug and explain what happened on her bday.", "I hope your jaw spoke some choice words to MIL.", "NTA - not even for acting though; for literally being sick as a result of treatment. Like I cant understand why no one defended OP... her parents not being upset with her? Wtf is that... they should have jumped to her defence and told her aunt and uncles off. This is their child people are shaming for her cancer treatment.", "Re: the good thing \u2014 cancer or not, people need to drop the healthist virtue signaling. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business what other people are eating.", "Excuse me lack empathy but still can cognitively understand that someone going through chemo is going to be feeling tired and sick. The family members here are just ass holes", "Gatorade is a lifesaver. Genuinely. You can also find single-flavour packs of the crystals on amazon if any of the flavours make you nauseous or are unappetizing, OP.", "What a wise comment. Your Dad was fortunate to have you. Lost my Mom & MIL to cancer. But they were so brave!", "I stand corrected", "Yes, Gatorade was very helpful to me. Some chemo patients swear by Pedialyte, but I never tried it.", "Ty! Unfortunately he passed in January - had a very aggressive, rare cancer known for being refractory. I'm sorry for your loss and they were lucky to have you as well. Fighting cancer is the bravest fight I know.", "I have never had cancer, but I can see how the plain stuff might be especially useful - they have unflavored Pedialyte. It just tastes faintly salty to me, so may be useful for anyone who has issues with things being too sweet (one of my dad's symptoms in the second type of chemo). I do find the texture is a bit thicker/gloopier than Gatorade, but you can always water it down.", "Oh my, so sorry for your loss, too. \ud83e\udd79\ud83d\udd4a"]}
