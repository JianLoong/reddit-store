Since I\u2019m sick they made it safe. It was outside, everyone wore masks, and there was lots of hand sanitizer and Clorox wipes. \n\n\nSince being sick I most days dress very comfy in lounge shorts and a T-shirt. Well, today I did the same thing. Well, a few family members (aunts and uncles and a few older cousins) kept asking why I decided to \u201cdress like that\u201d and that I should put more effort into my appearance. Nobody was super dressed up but I was the most underdressed. My parents said something but didn\u2019t want to get mad because they didn\u2019t want to ruin the day for my grandma which I understand. \n\nChemo messed up my taste buds and make me nauseous. the main things I can eat that don\u2019t make me completely sick are different types of potatoes,  grilled chicken, and popsicles/slushes. Well, all they had that I could eat and not vomit were popsicles so I had a few. Those same family members kept criticizing me saying I need to be healthier and eat actual food. I explained (so did my parents) the chemo has made me not be able to eat a lot of foods and popsicles are one of the \u201csafe\u201d things I can eat. \n\n\nI wanted to yell at them but my parents reminded me we shouldn\u2019t ruin the day for grandma. Well, I held my tongue until I complained about being exhausted and wanting to go home soon to my mom. And one of my aunts said, \u201cwhat do you do that makes you so tired, every time I talk to your dad you are laying around or watching tv\u201d. I finally got too upset so I said well my body is constantly trying to fight off cancer cells while making the rest of me sick and weak. \n\nThen I said so if you guys want to keep criticizing me you guys can experience cancer and chemo and then if you want to keep criticizing me go right ahead. I then apologized to my grandma and walk away. As I was I heard my aunts and uncles grilling my parents for what I said. My parents aren\u2019t upset but I do feel like I ruined the party by saying what I said.

They don\u2019t like things they can\u2019t control, so they try to control the person with the disease or disability. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this. Cancer sucks. Treatment for cancer sucks. You go right ahead and shout that from the mountain tops (or directly into these selfish relatives\u2019 faces). \n\nHow dare they?

I was diagnosed with endometrial cancer last year and had a radical hysterectomy and 6 mos of relatively low impact chemo. It was already a completely useless organ that I was glad to get rid of, the chemo regimen was not that bad, and no matter how I downplayed it and said I was fine, feeling fine, don't worry about me, people were constantly asking and worrying and my work was like\"whatever you need for time off, don't worry about it.\" Meantime, you have a cancer that affects your bone marrow, not so useless and expendable, and probably had a way harsher chemo regimen and your family expects you to, what, just woman up and act like you're at the peak of health?", "Definitely NTA. Your aunts and uncles kept pushing and pushing, until you've had enough.", "NTA - 1st and foremost you are battling CANCER. This isn\u2019t a stroll in the park. You are in a battle for your life. Chemo is so draining because it\u2019s like a wildfire in the body. Popsicles are cooling. That was always a chemo favorite in \nmy family too. \n\nIgnorant people are annoying and your family needs to get a clue. \n\nI\u2019m proud of you for advocating for yourself. Don\u2019t apologize anymore to anyone for fighting to LIVE. \n\nAnd tell them that\u2019s what your purpose is right now HEALING and  LIVING. \n\nWish I could hug you. You\u2019ve got this, OP. You are a badass warrior. ((((((Hugs)))))))\n\nIf anyone doesn\u2019t get that, then they can pound sand, sweetheart.", "NTA and I am so FUCKING proud of you. Not even chemo can hurt that shiny backbone of yours. Good on you, OP.", "NTA, not only are you dealing with shit you also apologised to your grandma, the one person your parents were afraid of ruining the day for.

I\u2019ve got Stage IV colon cancer and am going through chemo. Everything you said is valid\u2026 Foods taste weird and ir sucks. You get tired as hell and it sucks. Sometimes you get rashes and need comfy clothes and it sucks. There are good times (the off weeks if you get them) and bad times, and maybe you\u2019ll learn to tolerate the effects over time, but chemo is downright hard!\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to face that kind of criticism. In my experience, most people treat you with an extreme amount of grace and leeway when they find out what you\u2019re up against, and I hope that\u2019s the case for you outside of this incident.\n\nAnyways, not much more to say than good luck to you from one person living with cancer to another. Keep on going.", "NTA. Your extended family can go kick rocks for picking on a kid who is battling cancer. Wishing you the best of luck. \n\nCancer sucks, treatment sucks and so does your extended family.", "These people have zero empathy, I hope your parents set them straight about their cruel and pointless busybodying... in writing, so they remember it, hopefully.

I hope you beat the sh$t out of that nasty cancer!", "NTA - had you been my niece I would have been overjoyed you were able to make it, tried to make you as comfortable as possible and asked your parents beforehand if I could make or bring  any particular food that might be appetising to you. Your aunts and cousins sound like d\\*cks, just quietly, and they\u2019re the ones who ruined the day.", "Nta!! Your relatives suck so much. They need to educate themselves. Why do you need to act strong? What does that accomplish? So they don't feel bad?\n\nYou are a teenager going through  treatment that literally kills cells that are growing/dividing and your body is fighting!! Of course you are tired and there are only certain things you can do because it sucks. Please know you didn't do anything wrong. You didn't ask for cancer. You are doing the best you can.", "NTA.  As a cancer survivor myself I feel your pain. Physically and emotionally.  They have no right to criticize you at all.   Family should stand by you, not attack you for not dressing how they like, or eating how they like.  You did nothing wrong. \n\nAs a tip: Work with your infusion nurse.  Try to  take some safe food and drink with you to chemo .  Nibble VERY SLOWLY and take tiny sips during infusion.   I had a LOT of stomach issues (vomiting) at first but a seasoned infusion nurse told me to try and nibble/ sip every 15 minutes or so  and it really helped.   She also changed the order in which the chemo drugs (I had 5 different drugs) were administered saying that in her experience adding benadryl early and not giving me these 2 chemo drugs back to back should help.  She was also able to add a anti- nausea med once we determined which drug was the main cause of the vomiting.   They are there to help you thru this nasty stuff.  They know the tricks but often won't tell you unless you ask.  Sometimes you have to ask around and find the most seasoned nurse as this stuff is not taught but comes from experience.  \n\nGood luck and stay safe.", "NTA. \n\nI know when my sister was going through treatment she always dressed nice to make people feel more comfortable around her. People don\u2019t want to be confronted with the reality of young people having cancer. But that\u2019s their problem, not yours.", "You are SO SO SO NTA! \n\nYou're strong as hell for even getting up and GOING to the party while dealing with chemo! One of my close friends went through leukemia treatment several years ago. She's doing really well now, but I remember how absolutely miserable so much of that time period was for her. \n\nHell, I'm dealing with serious but *much* less severe health problems at the moment, and I would've shown up at that party in comfy clothes, too!   \nI also can only eat a select few Safe Foods at the moment (mostly Ensure shakes, ugh), and if anyone dared to give me shit about it there's no way I'd just stand around and take it either! You lasted longer than I would've.\n\nPeople tend to have this attitude that if you're not in the hospital hooked up to an IV line, a pulse oximeter, and a BP cuff at the very least, then you're *clearly* not *that sick*.   \nLike nope, hate to break it to you, but I dragged my ass out to this event *despite* being *that sick*, not because I'm actually *not that sick*. \n\nAnyway, keep kicking leukemia's ass\u2014hope ya make a full recovery!", "YTA - Cancer jokes? Not cool. But hey, at least you've got a strong sense of timing!", "NTA. Can't believe this happened to you. I'm so sorry.. stay strong and fight!!! You are amazing and will triumph. Don't let any of this cause stress,. Don't waste a second thinking about it.", "NTA- your body is trying to kill you and your medicine to kill it is also trying to kill you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your family doesn\u2019t understand, and I hope your grandma will understand why you finally snapped.  I\u2019m sure if you threw up the \u201chealthier\u201d food then they\u2019d be mad at you for that too.\n\nForget them, focus on your battle and stay strong.", "Definitely not the AH.\nBut id call grandma later and talk to her. It was her day and you did your best to be there for her. It is surprising that any adult who knows that someone is activly going through chemo, would comment on your low energy and the want to be comfortable when your body is going through so much. I'll be generous and say the comment about your eating could have come from a place of caring. It would have been nice if it came accross that way instead of critical. l hope they understood after things were explained. \n\n... im thinking on it. I wasnt there, so you may ignore this. What youre going through(to put it extremely mildly) is stressful and takes a hell of a toll. I wonder if you were feeling sensitive and felt that everything said about you was critical and that might not have been the spirit it was intended? Again, i wasnt there, and you are still NOT the AH, but thinking on it, its baffling that grown adults could act so ridiculous. That last aunt though? Clearly the AH. No defending her comment on you laying around. That was stupid to say.", "You are a kid with cancer doing chemo! They can all go fuck off! Rest up and eat all the food you can. NTA. You are allowed to be comfortable.", "NTA. Your family are insensitive jerks.\n\nWe know you\u2019re going through hell and I hope the reward for you is a long healthy life at the end of it.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for people to appreciate how serious something can be. My parents didn\u2019t appreciate how bad my allergies were, even after an anaphylactic reaction, until testing last year shows how bad.

All those difficult teen boys in my school were super protective of him, put a word out that he is under classmates protection and nobody can make fun of his appearance or tease him. Unfortunately some of the teachers were not so great and one even tried to get rid of him because she thought that school is no place for \u201cthat\u201d kid. \n\nAll my classmates stand up against her and push administration to leave him alone, so he successfully graduated with us \ud83e\udd0d\n\nUnfortunately some people are too emotionally immature to accept that someone is going through difficult times and  choosing pretend ignorance over basic human decency. \nI\u2019m glad your parents are on your side.
