Your daughter is an adult with adult work commitments and can't just wander off on an impromptu trip because you feel like it.\n\n>She'd rather give them a vacation than spend time with us and I told her this.\n\nThis statement is abusive, false, and yet strangely prophetic because you are doing absolutely everything in your power to ensure that your daughter does NOT want to spend time with you. Keep up the disrespect and you'll never see her again.", "Yta in this situation.  When you surprise your adult daughter, who has her own responsibilities, you run the risk of those things conflicting. She wasn't wrong to not cancel", "YTA. Your daughter has to work and can't make it. She promised them she'd be there, so respect that.", "YTA. This is her JOB. This is how she supports herself. That family depends on her and she is committed.

She's an adult with a JOB, you also an adult with a job should be fully aware you cannot always duck out for a trip. **JUST BECAUSE YOU THINK THE TRIP IS IMPORTANT, DOES NOT MAKE IT SO FOR HER.**\n\nShe's a FT nanny, possibly even live in which means she cannot just \"Take time off\". If you don't respect what she does just say that because its obvious. \n\nTake this as a lesson because your 18 year old will soon enough ALSO have a schedule which means you need to **TALK TO AND PLAN THINGS OUT WITH THE OTHER ADULTS.**", "YTA. You're disrespecting your daughter's job and work. And then you tried to guilt her and gaslight her.

You expect your daughter to ditch her job just because you want to see her.\n\nYou should be proud that you've raised a child who honors her commitments but instead you're sad because you aren't getting your way.\n\nMight want to rethink your position here and also, give a helluva lot more advance notice for special family events if you really want her to attend. She's an adult with time commitments that she can't just drop because you want her too.

Nice way to play the victim though.", "YTA - WOW!  You have a responsible daughter who HONORS her commitments and you try to shame her into risking her job!?  Here is another option, PLAN AHEAD, so she can know in advance when she needs to request time of!

Would the Mom's really care if she cancelled one weekend? Probably not. But, what your asking of your Daughter is for her to compromise on her values.\n\nIt sounds like you just have to come to terms with the fact that your Daughter(s) are starting to create their own lives.

Go with the other two or delay until a time all three can go.", "Well, you're not TA for wanting to spend time with her, but the thing with surprise trips is that people who work might not be able or want to get out of a work commitment on short notice.
