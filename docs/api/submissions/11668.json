Thus growing up, my family had always stressed that I (f27) had to marry a Muslim Pakistani man and, trying to be a good daughter, I would just nod in agreement.\n\nThen I went to college, and in my first day of class I sat next to this Punjabi Sikh man (he isn't and wasn't turbaned just for clarification). Also I'll call him Raj (m27) to hide his identity. He was extremely handsome, charming, intelligent and tall. It felt like he had walked out of a movie and just for me. Originally I tried not to show any interest in him, but eventually he won me over.\n\nAfter finishing my third-year, my parents tried to get me an arranged marriage but instead I told them about Raj. They were very pleased to hear that he was Punjabi, but when I told them he was an Indian Sikh...they got very angry. They said I was abandoning my faith. Eventually after yelling at me and trying to forcibly take me back to Pakistan (I refused to go), they kicked me out of the house.\n\nI went to Raj and he went in-person to convince them and they just humiliated him. Soon, after he got admission into medical school and I finished my accounting degree, we got married. My own parents (and that entire side of the family) refused to come to my wedding. They told me they had disowned me.\n\nWe had both an Islamic and Sikh (one as an Anand Karaj and the other a Nikkah) wedding. Since then my faith has only gotten stronger. I started wearing a Hijab again and my husband motivates me every day to become a better Muslim. We waited a few years (until he graduated Medical School and got into Residency) to have kids. But just a couple of months ago, we had our first baby boy.\n\nSoon, my parents somehow found out (maybe through a cousin that told them of a post I made on facebook) and started to reach out again. They said, they wanted to meet their grandson. I refused them. My mother cried to me and tried to apologize but I wasn't having it. My husband has stated, that he will support me whatever decision I take but my father-in-law said maybe it is time to reconcile. He says he understands it was wrong what they did but maybe its time to move on and pave a kinder future. I respect my father-in-law too much to disregard what he is saying but I still don't want to let them back into my life. They were horrible to me and I don't want them in my life again.\n\nAITA for this?\n\nFYI: Please do not disrespect my father-in-law. He is a very very kind man. He even made the entire house practice Ramadan so I wouldn't feel alone doing it and he prays with me every morning so I do not feel alone for Fajr.

There's no point in introducing them to your son if they aren't really remorseful/are going to fall back into old behavior. \n\nThat said you don't have to let them back into your life. Your son and any other kids you may have will do just fine with  just your FIL's love and attention.", "From your post, your parents don't actually want to apologize to you, and make amends with you: they want a relationship with your son.\n\nYour parents sound like they are fairly traditional Pakistani Muslims, so I will say this: if they are sincere in wanting to rebuild a relationship with you, then the apology absolutely must come from your father. He needs to admit his fault and promise to to better in the future - then you might have a foundation on which to rebuild a relationship.\n\nNTA", "You, your husband and your father in law sound absolutely lovely. NTA and there's no wrong answer here. You could ban them forever because what they did is unforgivable - totally understandable. You could give them one chance to meet your husband and son and it could teach them about tolerance - it wouldn't be the first time a grandbaby turned someone around. Or you could give them a chance and find that they're hopeless. All are possible and none make you the asshole.", "NTA\nIt sounds like you married into a lovely family. \nEmbrace that. \nAnd considering your FiL's words, while respectful and reasonable, doesn't mean you must choose to follow them. \n\nThing is, this is a choice for you to make. And whichever you choose, it is your right to do so. Trust yourself to know what is healthier for you, and the family you are building.", "NTA. If you don't want them in your life you don't have to have them", "Good for you for holding your own on this!! I'd keep that baby away too. \n\nYour FIL is probably just a kind soul that wants to keep the peace.

You are not an asshole for not choosing to reach out at this point. However, it might be a kind and reasonable thing to do to try to include your parents in your grandson's life, for his benefit, *if* you think you can do so safely.\n\nLook, there's cultural differences and prejudices, which we all have, and then there's kidnapping. You say your parents tried to \"forcibly take you back to Pakistan,\" despite the fact that you are a full-grown adult. That is deeply concerning, and makes me worry about them doing trying to do something similar with your grandson. Hopefully, that's totally off-base, and they absolutely would not do that (and hopefully when you say \"forcibly,\" you mean \"demanded angrily but did not physically try to make you go\").\n\nIf it is indeed unlikely or not the case, then I think you are probably safe with the protection of your husband and in-laws. You could try to set clear boundaries with your parents (\"you *must* be respectful towards my husband and in-laws*\", \"you must respect their religion and practices,\" \"you must treat my grandson appropriately\", etc.) and then see if they will follow them. If they do, and they are indeed contrite, it is in everyone's best interest to try to forge a new relationship. But if they're not... I wouldn't give them a ton of second chances.\n\nBy the way, your father-in-law does sound like a wise and caring man. I'm glad you have a good relationship with him.", "NTA.

When someone disowns you as your family did, it is implied as something a \"for life\" thing. You do not need to forgive them, nor give them access to you or your children if you are not comfortable. It sounds like you have built a truly triumphant life with a wonderful man and supportive extended inlaws. The respect and support for your individuality in your relationship glows from your post, and it sounds like your father-in-law has good intentions. Not all wounds heal well. Ask in your own heart what would be best for your mental health and that of your child. The choice whether to reconnect with family is yours, and I see no road here where you would be the AH. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nYour parents rejected you and your husband. It is clear that they are interested in their grandson, but it does not seem they are truly interested in rebuilding their relationship with you or building one with Raj.\n\nYour father-in-law means well, but I would advise extreme caution if you let your parents back into your life. Whatever you decide, I wish you, Raj, and your son the best.", "NTA.  Are you sure they don't have an ulterior motive?  Depending on how angry they are/were over this, would they tey to take your child away?", "NTA\n\nIt's always so funny to me how people can disown someone and treat them terribly, then when they decide they want something (usually a grandkid), it's time to just move on and let everything go. Just astounding. They have a lot of work to do apologizing and trying to earn forgiveness before they just get a relationship with their grandkids. \n\nI relate. I'm currently pregnant, and we don't have a relationship with my in-laws. While I want my daughter to have a big extended family, they will not be meeting her. They have done terrible things to my husband and I both. Our child is half me and half him, so why would I trust people that have mistreated the two of us to be good to my kids? Why risk it? It's really basic that people be able to treat their own kids ok before they're around yours.", "NTA, they don\u2019t care about you, they just want access to the child, which is a right they gave away when they disowned you. Your FIL may be forgiving, but you do not have to be.", "Hugs \u2764\ufe0f.  Being disowned is a tough thing to get passed. If you do choose to see them I would suggest you and DH meet them in a public place, without your child. I would have a frank conversation about how much they hurt you and how horrible they treated you!  Tell them you don\u2019t know if you will ever be able to forgive their betrayal of you.   Hear them out and go back home to digest what was said before you agree to reconciliation.    I don\u2019t know if you will be happier with them in your life or without them in your life, what ever you decide to do will be the correct decision.    Personally I don\u2019t think I would be able to forgive them, no parent should disown their child for choosing their own spouse and life to lead.", "NTA. Your FIL sounds like a kind smart man that you respect. It's worth considering reaching out to your family, let them know you're doing it for him, not them, and letting them try to mend their relationship with you. You're absolutely right to protect your babies from their bigotry though, and my NTA stands regardless of whether you reach out or not.", "NTA\n\nYou are so very lucky to have found such a loving and supportive family to marry into.

But they aren't ones for reaching out. You don't have to let them back into your life. You don't need to believe they've grown or changed. And you'll likely never trust them again. \n\n\nBut also, it's okay to try if you want to. Absolutely meet them with just you and your husband first, if you do decide to meet. Use their attitude towards him as a barometer for whether you want them around your kids at all. It's okay to decide no. You can change your mind at any point and go no contact again. You can choose to explore this as an option or keep that door firmly shut for your sanity.\n\n\nMy partner's mother is horrific. She'd rather her daughter was a murderer than in a relationship with another woman. We've had nearly a decade of hell trying to give her time to come around, keep contact with other family, and have that fanily repeatedly let us down in an attempt to keep the peace. Finally, I got apologies from the other family members and they've stuck to supporting us. Sometimes I wish I'd had stronger boundaries and insisted my partner go LC/NC, but like your husband I wanted to support her whatever she decided. They've shown me that they do have capacity for change. But it's been painful to get here so I absolutely wouldn't judge you for deciding that isn't worth the risk. Especially with a child involved. \n\nAbove all remember this:\n\nYou are in control. You decide what is best for your family. \n\nGood luck, whatever you decide.", "NTA.\n\nAnd from your description your FIL is a gem", "NTA.\n\nYour parents don't care about you.

He says he understands it was wrong what they did but maybe its time to move on and pave a kinder future.\n\nI'm not surprised your FIL is voting for forgiveness.  Every Sikh I've ever met has been awesome.  He's just continuing the trend.  I completely understand why you don't want to talk to your parents - it sounds like the entire situation was very hurtful for you.\n\nTo be honest, my mom would probably throw a fit if I were to marry a non-Muslim.  She probably wouldn't have come to the wedding either.  But I don't think she'd be angry at me forever.  I think eventually she'd be sad that I wasn't in her life anymore, and I think she'd honestly want to reconnect.  And I think she'd realize she'd have to keep quiet about certain things that we'd disagree on, like the fact that I married a non-Muslim.\n\nYou know your parents better than we do.  Do you think it's possible that they regret this estrangement?  Do you think it's possible that they regret how they acted?  I know Reddit's big on \"cutting people off\" and \"going no contact\" - but while that may feel good in an empty, vengeful sort of way, I wonder if it's the best thing, emotionally speaking.\n\nYou certainly have the \"right\" to never talk to your parents again.  So I'm not going to call you an AH for wanting to avoid them.  But I wonder... do you think they'd make good grandparents?  My mom, for example, was SUPER strict with my sister and me when we were growing up.  But with her grandbabies?  Total pushover lol.  Sometimes people can surprise you.  Do you think your children would enjoy having them as grandparents?  Having more people to love and who love you in return isn't a bad thing, you know.\n\nAlso, (and I know Reddit's going to crucify me for this, but whatever), you say your faith has gotten stronger.  What do you think Allah would say about trying to talk to your parents again?  What do you think Allah would say about your mother crying to you and trying to apologize and you \"not having it\"?\n\nDo you think people can change?  Do you think people can sincerely repent?  Do you think people deserve a second chance?\n\nMaybe I'm biased because I've screwed up so many times in my life, and my mother has forgiven me each and every single time.  I have made her life objectively more difficult, and she still loves me.  If she decided that my latest disaster was IT and she was DONE...?  I'd be devastated.  I'd deserve it, 100%, but I'd still be devastated.\n\nNo one is \"owed\" forgiveness, that is true.  But that's what makes forgiveness so special.  You don't have to give it, so when you do, it feels... like you're clean again.  Genuine forgiveness is as much for the person doing the forgiveness as it is for the person who committed the offense.  Maybe even more so.\n\nMy family is from Pakistan.  The men there can be... overbearing.  Is it possible that your mom simply went along with what her husband said, even though she may have wanted to do something differently?  It's not an excuse, but it could be an explanation.  And sometimes an explanation is all we need to understand the other person.  And when we understand the other person, we can start to... forgive, maybe?\n\nI don't know.  Like I said, you know your parents better than we do.  Maybe your relationship is irrevocably broken.  Maybe your family would be better off without them in your lives.  I just feel bad for you.  You seem like a lovely person, but you have such pain bottled up inside.  I just wish you had a better relationship with your parents for your sake.", "NTA. Your FIL means well, and is clearly sympathetic to others, and empathizing with your parents from a grandparent point of view. He's a good man in my opinion. But only you and your husband truly know what is best for your family and in particular for your son. \n\nThere is no reason why you couldn't restrict contact to Facetime or Zoom meetings AFTER they apologize to you and your husband and AFTER you feel it is safe to introduce them to your son.", "NTA.

If not, then don\u2019t waste your time.\n\nNot Muslim or Pakistani or Indian, but this reminds me of my family (we\u2019re American). My mother was raised in house that was very \u201cblack power\u201d and \u201cwhite people are all bad\u2014 stay away!\u201d Then she met my dad, a white man, in her late teens, and the rest is history. It took a LOT of time and baby steps, but both my grandparents eventually came round and attended the wedding, though my parents had been together for seven years by that point.
