Thus growing up, my family had always stressed that I (f27) had to marry a Muslim Pakistani man and, trying to be a good daughter, I would just nod in agreement.\n\nThen I went to college, and in my first day of class I sat next to this Punjabi Sikh man (he isn't and wasn't turbaned just for clarification). Also I'll call him Raj (m27) to hide his identity. He was extremely handsome, charming, intelligent and tall. It felt like he had walked out of a movie and just for me. Originally I tried not to show any interest in him, but eventually he won me over.\n\nAfter finishing my third-year, my parents tried to get me an arranged marriage but instead I told them about Raj. They were very pleased to hear that he was Punjabi, but when I told them he was an Indian Sikh...they got very angry. They said I was abandoning my faith. Eventually after yelling at me and trying to forcibly take me back to Pakistan (I refused to go), they kicked me out of the house.\n\nI went to Raj and he went in-person to convince them and they just humiliated him. Soon, after he got admission into medical school and I finished my accounting degree, we got married. My own parents (and that entire side of the family) refused to come to my wedding. They told me they had disowned me.\n\nWe had both an Islamic and Sikh (one as an Anand Karaj and the other a Nikkah) wedding. Since then my faith has only gotten stronger. I started wearing a Hijab again and my husband motivates me every day to become a better Muslim. We waited a few years (until he graduated Medical School and got into Residency) to have kids. But just a couple of months ago, we had our first baby boy.\n\nSoon, my parents somehow found out (maybe through a cousin that told them of a post I made on facebook) and started to reach out again. They said, they wanted to meet their grandson. I refused them. My mother cried to me and tried to apologize but I wasn't having it. My husband has stated, that he will support me whatever decision I take but my father-in-law said maybe it is time to reconcile. He says he understands it was wrong what they did but maybe its time to move on and pave a kinder future. I respect my father-in-law too much to disregard what he is saying but I still don't want to let them back into my life. They were horrible to me and I don't want them in my life again.\n\nAITA for this?\n\nFYI: Please do not disrespect my father-in-law. He is a very very kind man. He even made the entire house practice Ramadan so I wouldn't feel alone doing it and he prays with me every morning so I do not feel alone for Fajr.

There's no point in introducing them to your son if they aren't really remorseful/are going to fall back into old behavior. \n\nThat said you don't have to let them back into your life. Your son and any other kids you may have will do just fine with  just your FIL's love and attention.", "From your post, your parents don't actually want to apologize to you, and make amends with you: they want a relationship with your son.\n\nYour parents sound like they are fairly traditional Pakistani Muslims, so I will say this: if they are sincere in wanting to rebuild a relationship with you, then the apology absolutely must come from your father. He needs to admit his fault and promise to to better in the future - then you might have a foundation on which to rebuild a relationship.\n\nNTA", "You, your husband and your father in law sound absolutely lovely. NTA and there's no wrong answer here. You could ban them forever because what they did is unforgivable - totally understandable. You could give them one chance to meet your husband and son and it could teach them about tolerance - it wouldn't be the first time a grandbaby turned someone around. Or you could give them a chance and find that they're hopeless. All are possible and none make you the asshole.", "NTA\nIt sounds like you married into a lovely family. \nEmbrace that. \nAnd considering your FiL's words, while respectful and reasonable, doesn't mean you must choose to follow them. \n\nThing is, this is a choice for you to make. And whichever you choose, it is your right to do so. Trust yourself to know what is healthier for you, and the family you are building.", "NTA. If you don't want them in your life you don't have to have them", "Good for you for holding your own on this!! I'd keep that baby away too. \n\nYour FIL is probably just a kind soul that wants to keep the peace.

You are not an asshole for not choosing to reach out at this point. However, it might be a kind and reasonable thing to do to try to include your parents in your grandson's life, for his benefit, *if* you think you can do so safely.\n\nLook, there's cultural differences and prejudices, which we all have, and then there's kidnapping. You say your parents tried to \"forcibly take you back to Pakistan,\" despite the fact that you are a full-grown adult. That is deeply concerning, and makes me worry about them doing trying to do something similar with your grandson. Hopefully, that's totally off-base, and they absolutely would not do that (and hopefully when you say \"forcibly,\" you mean \"demanded angrily but did not physically try to make you go\").\n\nIf it is indeed unlikely or not the case, then I think you are probably safe with the protection of your husband and in-laws. You could try to set clear boundaries with your parents (\"you *must* be respectful towards my husband and in-laws*\", \"you must respect their religion and practices,\" \"you must treat my grandson appropriately\", etc.) and then see if they will follow them. If they do, and they are indeed contrite, it is in everyone's best interest to try to forge a new relationship. But if they're not... I wouldn't give them a ton of second chances.\n\nBy the way, your father-in-law does sound like a wise and caring man. I'm glad you have a good relationship with him.", "NTA.

When someone disowns you as your family did, it is implied as something a \"for life\" thing. You do not need to forgive them, nor give them access to you or your children if you are not comfortable. It sounds like you have built a truly triumphant life with a wonderful man and supportive extended inlaws. The respect and support for your individuality in your relationship glows from your post, and it sounds like your father-in-law has good intentions. Not all wounds heal well. Ask in your own heart what would be best for your mental health and that of your child. The choice whether to reconnect with family is yours, and I see no road here where you would be the AH. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nYour parents rejected you and your husband. It is clear that they are interested in their grandson, but it does not seem they are truly interested in rebuilding their relationship with you or building one with Raj.\n\nYour father-in-law means well, but I would advise extreme caution if you let your parents back into your life. Whatever you decide, I wish you, Raj, and your son the best.", "NTA.  Are you sure they don't have an ulterior motive?  Depending on how angry they are/were over this, would they tey to take your child away?", "NTA\n\nIt's always so funny to me how people can disown someone and treat them terribly, then when they decide they want something (usually a grandkid), it's time to just move on and let everything go. Just astounding. They have a lot of work to do apologizing and trying to earn forgiveness before they just get a relationship with their grandkids. \n\nI relate. I'm currently pregnant, and we don't have a relationship with my in-laws. While I want my daughter to have a big extended family, they will not be meeting her. They have done terrible things to my husband and I both. Our child is half me and half him, so why would I trust people that have mistreated the two of us to be good to my kids? Why risk it? It's really basic that people be able to treat their own kids ok before they're around yours.", "NTA, they don\u2019t care about you, they just want access to the child, which is a right they gave away when they disowned you. Your FIL may be forgiving, but you do not have to be.", "Hugs \u2764\ufe0f.  Being disowned is a tough thing to get passed. If you do choose to see them I would suggest you and DH meet them in a public place, without your child. I would have a frank conversation about how much they hurt you and how horrible they treated you!  Tell them you don\u2019t know if you will ever be able to forgive their betrayal of you.   Hear them out and go back home to digest what was said before you agree to reconciliation.    I don\u2019t know if you will be happier with them in your life or without them in your life, what ever you decide to do will be the correct decision.    Personally I don\u2019t think I would be able to forgive them, no parent should disown their child for choosing their own spouse and life to lead.", "NTA. Your FIL sounds like a kind smart man that you respect. It's worth considering reaching out to your family, let them know you're doing it for him, not them, and letting them try to mend their relationship with you. You're absolutely right to protect your babies from their bigotry though, and my NTA stands regardless of whether you reach out or not.", "NTA\n\nYou are so very lucky to have found such a loving and supportive family to marry into.

But they aren't ones for reaching out. You don't have to let them back into your life. You don't need to believe they've grown or changed. And you'll likely never trust them again. \n\n\nBut also, it's okay to try if you want to. Absolutely meet them with just you and your husband first, if you do decide to meet. Use their attitude towards him as a barometer for whether you want them around your kids at all. It's okay to decide no. You can change your mind at any point and go no contact again. You can choose to explore this as an option or keep that door firmly shut for your sanity.\n\n\nMy partner's mother is horrific. She'd rather her daughter was a murderer than in a relationship with another woman. We've had nearly a decade of hell trying to give her time to come around, keep contact with other family, and have that fanily repeatedly let us down in an attempt to keep the peace. Finally, I got apologies from the other family members and they've stuck to supporting us. Sometimes I wish I'd had stronger boundaries and insisted my partner go LC/NC, but like your husband I wanted to support her whatever she decided. They've shown me that they do have capacity for change. But it's been painful to get here so I absolutely wouldn't judge you for deciding that isn't worth the risk. Especially with a child involved. \n\nAbove all remember this:\n\nYou are in control. You decide what is best for your family. \n\nGood luck, whatever you decide.", "NTA.\n\nAnd from your description your FIL is a gem", "NTA.\n\nYour parents don't care about you.

He says he understands it was wrong what they did but maybe its time to move on and pave a kinder future.\n\nI'm not surprised your FIL is voting for forgiveness.  Every Sikh I've ever met has been awesome.  He's just continuing the trend.  I completely understand why you don't want to talk to your parents - it sounds like the entire situation was very hurtful for you.\n\nTo be honest, my mom would probably throw a fit if I were to marry a non-Muslim.  She probably wouldn't have come to the wedding either.  But I don't think she'd be angry at me forever.  I think eventually she'd be sad that I wasn't in her life anymore, and I think she'd honestly want to reconnect.  And I think she'd realize she'd have to keep quiet about certain things that we'd disagree on, like the fact that I married a non-Muslim.\n\nYou know your parents better than we do.  Do you think it's possible that they regret this estrangement?  Do you think it's possible that they regret how they acted?  I know Reddit's big on \"cutting people off\" and \"going no contact\" - but while that may feel good in an empty, vengeful sort of way, I wonder if it's the best thing, emotionally speaking.\n\nYou certainly have the \"right\" to never talk to your parents again.  So I'm not going to call you an AH for wanting to avoid them.  But I wonder... do you think they'd make good grandparents?  My mom, for example, was SUPER strict with my sister and me when we were growing up.  But with her grandbabies?  Total pushover lol.  Sometimes people can surprise you.  Do you think your children would enjoy having them as grandparents?  Having more people to love and who love you in return isn't a bad thing, you know.\n\nAlso, (and I know Reddit's going to crucify me for this, but whatever), you say your faith has gotten stronger.  What do you think Allah would say about trying to talk to your parents again?  What do you think Allah would say about your mother crying to you and trying to apologize and you \"not having it\"?\n\nDo you think people can change?  Do you think people can sincerely repent?  Do you think people deserve a second chance?\n\nMaybe I'm biased because I've screwed up so many times in my life, and my mother has forgiven me each and every single time.  I have made her life objectively more difficult, and she still loves me.  If she decided that my latest disaster was IT and she was DONE...?  I'd be devastated.  I'd deserve it, 100%, but I'd still be devastated.\n\nNo one is \"owed\" forgiveness, that is true.  But that's what makes forgiveness so special.  You don't have to give it, so when you do, it feels... like you're clean again.  Genuine forgiveness is as much for the person doing the forgiveness as it is for the person who committed the offense.  Maybe even more so.\n\nMy family is from Pakistan.  The men there can be... overbearing.  Is it possible that your mom simply went along with what her husband said, even though she may have wanted to do something differently?  It's not an excuse, but it could be an explanation.  And sometimes an explanation is all we need to understand the other person.  And when we understand the other person, we can start to... forgive, maybe?\n\nI don't know.  Like I said, you know your parents better than we do.  Maybe your relationship is irrevocably broken.  Maybe your family would be better off without them in your lives.  I just feel bad for you.  You seem like a lovely person, but you have such pain bottled up inside.  I just wish you had a better relationship with your parents for your sake.", "NTA. Your FIL means well, and is clearly sympathetic to others, and empathizing with your parents from a grandparent point of view. He's a good man in my opinion. But only you and your husband truly know what is best for your family and in particular for your son. \n\nThere is no reason why you couldn't restrict contact to Facetime or Zoom meetings AFTER they apologize to you and your husband and AFTER you feel it is safe to introduce them to your son.", "NTA.

If not, then don\u2019t waste your time.\n\nNot Muslim or Pakistani or Indian, but this reminds me of my family (we\u2019re American). My mother was raised in house that was very \u201cblack power\u201d and \u201cwhite people are all bad\u2014 stay away!\u201d Then she met my dad, a white man, in her late teens, and the rest is history. It took a LOT of time and baby steps, but both my grandparents eventually came round and attended the wedding, though my parents had been together for seven years by that point.

Big thing would be to see if they'd be accepting of your husband or if it is some sort of act. Set some ground rules too. If they've not changed, you can keep a clean conscious knowing you've attempted to make amends in the relations. Good luck!", "NTa. No insult to FIL but again he does not know your own personal experiences. \n\nYour parents are not owed a relationship with their grandson and it would not be reconciliation. They would still treat you as they have been, and they'd be trying to poison your own kid against you when he's gotten older.", "NTA. Your husband and FIL sound amazing and your FIL made a good point, but ultimately, your parents were terrible to you and your husband, and your feelings about not wanting them in your life again are totally valid. They probably don\u2019t even want a relationship with you, only your son. After all they\u2019ve done, I wouldn\u2019t give them that. All that said, you do you. Whatever choice you make here isn\u2019t wrong as long as you feel good about it.", "NTA. I wouldn't suggest letting them back in but that's your call.

Don't let them meet the grandchild too soon. Make sure that they are sincere.", "NTA\nYou don\u2019t owe your prents anything, especially after how they treated you.", "I hate to ask this but do you think they would want to meet your baby if they were a girl? Your parents sound very conservative and old fashioned so I don\u2019t think their intentions are to make amends and come together as a family again, but more like getting access to the next boy in the family. Do you think they will treat you and your husband any different or just focus on the baby ?", "First, congratulations for marrying into such a loving, supportive family.  \n\n\nSecond...it's really up to you.  Can you trust your family to be respectful to your husband and his family should your parents come to visit?  If you consider it, would you be willing to lay down some ground rules before they visit?  (Their reaction to ground rules would tell you a lot about how they plan to behave.)    \n\n\nYour FIL sounds like a lovely, loving man, but as kind and loving as he is, he didn't live through this, you did.  Again, it's completely up to you, and you will have to decide what is best for you and your family.", "NTA...  sounds like you have a amazing father-in-law & husband.  This is your decision and unfortunately I don't think posting is going to help you make this decision. \n\nCould you maybe meet them (in a neutral place) and have a conversation with them first.  Then make a decision based off what they say.  If you agree to let them meet the child.. I'd  tell them what your expectations are if you do allow them to see the child.  They can't be allow with him, them can't speak against this father/ family/ religion. whatever...", "I'm Indian, and I feel like I hear this story so many times - Parents disown child for an interracial relationship. As soon as child pops out a grandkid, parents are back, acting like nothing happened, no apologies, no acknowledgment of wrongdoing, feeling totally entitled to grandkid time. \n\nNah. Disowned means disowned.", "NTA\n\nYour father in law sounds like a kind man. However, this is not just about forgiveness. You are a mother who needs to protect her children. If you parents pull another stunt like they did kicking you out, it could be hurting your children this time. You cannot trust they will not treat your husband  badly, and it is damaging to a child to see a parent treated badly.\n\nForgiveness does not mean forgetting. Your parents destroyed a lot of trust and have done nothing to rebuild it. You know their motivation- access to their grandchildren. They, however, did not care how they hurt you prior to realizing grandchildren were in the picture. Imagine if one of your children went against their beliefs? Do you think they'd be treated well?\n\nAnd on the subject of forgiving and moving forward, that needs to be on your terms when you are ready. You were deeply hurt by your parents. That isn't something you can will away. And moving forward does not have to mean moving forward with them as a part of your life either. That's for you to decide. You need to make sure you have healed enough to make that choice tho", "NTA. They have to make it right with you before you allow them to meet baby. They don\u2019t get to meet him just bc they demand it and want to act like it\u2019s no big deal the way they treated you. \n\nSo happy that you have such a lovely FIL. I have little first hand experience with those of the Sikh faith but all I have heard and read is just as you describe your FIL. Kind, genteel, inclusive, peaceful.. This decision is yours alone to make and you have to make the decision you can live with. I wish you all the best.", "NTA. You\u2019ve got to do what feels right to you. Your parents disowned you and now want back in because you have kids. But on the flip side, you\u2019ve got a new extended family that have loved, supported and respected you from day 1. At the end of it, who do you want to have as influences in your kids\u2019 lives.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t think your FIL is wrong to have suggested you consider it (and that seems to be all he did), which I imagine is also in part him wanting to make sure that he is doing good by you as effectively your only parent and also wanting to make clear that he is OK whatever you do.  Probably also has the experience of how relationships that deep can come with a lot of regrets when we hold onto things.\n\nBut ultimately, you are the one that has had to go through the hurt.  They were your parents - they loved you and then they rejected you. And desi parents really know how to say hurtful things to their children, so I cannot even imagine what they possibly could have said to you.  So if this is what you feel is necessary, feel free to do it.  \n\nOne thing you may want to consider, separately from your child meeting them, is seeking closure. You say they have tried to apologise, but if you have not yet had a detailed conversation with them about everything that happened, maybe it\u2019s time now. In any case, I assume there is no way you would let them see your child without knowing that they do now respect your husband and his family, so this may be a good way to gauge that sentiment, as well as see how you feel after hearing them out. But again only if you feel comfortable with it, and this endeavour would be fruitful (for your own peace of mind).\n\nAnd just reading this - I\u2019m really happy that you ended up with such a supportive husband. And such a caring FIL. Mashallah. Wishing you all the best.", "If you decide to I would say to meet on neutral ground in a fully public setting to place appropriate social pressure to behave with politeness. Also to limit the chance they might try something stupid such as taking your son away, as far fetched as that idea may be.\n\nBut NTA whatever you decide. You might suggest to your FIL that this is something you would prefer to do when the child is older.", "NTA\n\nCan I just say your in-laws and husband sound wonderful.

Follow your heart and your gut instinct on this!", "NTA. Your parents were obviously, but it seems like your in-laws (even after they've passed) were far better people. Not that I've met a single Sikh who wasn't one of the kindest people. I'm so sorry that your own family was so backwards.", "Your husband and in-laws sound wonderful! That said:\n\nNTA. I understand your FIL's desire to be kind and gracious, but we have to look at it from the perspective of what can logically be expected going forward, for you and for your son (and any other children). So far, they are not building credibility - they are apologizing, but they had years in which to apologize. Now they are only doing something because they want access to your son - not because they remembered the child they had and loved and then tossed away for not making the choices they agree with.\n\nI would suggest if you feel comfortable talking with your FIL approaching it from this perspective. What steps are your parents taking to make YOU feel important to them, other than as provider of a grandchild? What message will this send to your son, now and going forward? If they want a relationship with the child, they first need to rebuild the relationship with the parent - and as an adult, that is your choice whether you want or feel ready for such an experience. The choice which will be healthiest for all of you, including your parents, is the one which paves the road to *real* healing and reconciliation - not a paper-thin apology offered by them to get what they want.", "NTA at all, not one bit.

Should you have an inkling that this may be the case, *definitely* stay away.", "NAH\n\nI would ask if your parents are willing to reconcile with yourself and your husband to a satisfactory level before introducing your new child to the mix. (Congratulations by the way, beautiful news). \n\nMy own personal take on this, is that Islam is about forgiveness. Without forgiveness on Earth, Allah will not forgive on judgement day. Then your parents will not go to Jannah. Are you ok with that? That is fine if so. If not, see if your family are willing to 'forgive' you. I say 'forgive' as you did nothing wrong but it was potentially wrong in their eyes, so from their perspective they would be forgiving you. If they can open their hearts to 'forgive' you first, then I would forgive them back. Essentially rebuild your own relationship and ensure its strength before introducing your lovely child to the mix. My best friend is a Muslim who loves his faith. I have tried to think what I would advise to him as a Muslim. I hope that makes sense.", "Your parents disowned you, what they did to you hurts you a lot. It's like they don't deserve to see their grandson after what they've done to you.", "NTA they disowned you, so you have every right to decide for yourself if you will allow them back in.  It's quite telling that in all those years they never reached out to reconnect with you, only when you had a child.", "NTA.  Repairing the damage they caused is their job, not yours.\n\nYour FIL is right, to an extent,  though.  I would say you should go 10 percent to them,  and let them come the other 90. But make them understand that it's their responsibility to come EVERY STEP of that 90 percent. \n\nIt costs nothing to be open to letting them earnestly and honestly rebuild bridges.  But it's absolutely their job to do the work", "NTA. and what a lovely family your husband has. I love how much they respect and honor your faith. but yeah, your boundaries are very important. they hurt you badly, and showed how trivial they consider your relationship, so you guarding yourself and your baby is valid.", "Without knowing where this is happening, it's impossible to judge if it is safe.

When your father reaches out to your Husband and apologizes for his treatment of him and you, then consider it. Until then?  Keep your distance.", "OOF - this one is tough. It kind of sounds like your parents are total racists. They hurt you deeply. You are trying to move on and keep unhealthy people out of your lives. When they disowned you they disowned your progeny.

If it goes well, and they can not be racist toward your in-laws, then perhaps there is hope for reconciliation.

Would you be OK with never being able to talk to them again? Would you be at peace with how your relationship ended? Then write a letter. After doing so, wait and read it to your trusted people (husband, father in law). In my experience, this will tell you if you are ready to reconcile.

Second point, his religion, is what they did not approve of.\n\nI\u2019ll give an example of my experience. I know someone personally (and close to me). She is Bengali Muslim and married a Pakistani Muslim man. HIS parents were only slightly okay with the marriage because she is Muslim but not Pakistani. Ideally they would have liked him to marry a Pakistani Muslim girl.\n\nFurthermore, they didn\u2019t object much because it\u2019s their SON.

How you are rearing your son? How their attitudes are towards his father and his family?

But I would require a significant amount of time spent in visits with you and your husband alone to make sure they can behave appropriately toward the two of you before you risk bringing your son to them.

I wouldn't leave them alone with my children either.", "NTA", "NTA- They made their choice about what was important.

And I'm so glad your baby is growing up in such a loving home!", "Also, they are to never babysit without supervision. I'vre read crazy stories of family members converting kids and taking them away...", ">I believe that forgiveness can only come after regret, repentance and retribution.\n\nI certainly understand where you're coming from.  It definitely feels more... satisfying? to get retribution when someone has harmed you.\n\nBut what you're describing - I simply don't think it's... realistic to expect from people like OP's parents.  You need to consider where they're from and the culture that they're steeped in.  It's nice to think about all the ways you can make someone self-flagellate, I suppose, but if that won't fix the relationship, who's really won, in the end?\n\nMy mom is from Pakistan.  She simply isn't capable of doing what you would want her to do.  She wasn't raised that way, and to ask her to essentially prostrate herself before her child would be an exercise in futility.  She would never do it.  And then we'd both be furiously alone, convinced of our own righteousness.\n\nIt seems like you're thinking of forgiveness fundamentally as a gift to the \"offender\".  That's why they don't get it if they haven't \"earned\" it.  But I'm not so sure I see it that way, especially in this particular case, and especially since OP has mentioned how important her faith is to her.\n\nThe thing is, forgiveness doesn't mean that a person wasn't wrong for what they did.  It also doesn't make it \"okay\" that they did it.  What forgiveness allows the *giver* to do is just let go of the bitterness and anger.  It allows the giver to move past the hurt, and to maybe see their way towards a new beginning.  \n\nMaybe no new beginning is possible.  It's certainly possible to tell someone \"I forgive you for what you've done to me.  But for my own well-being, I cannot allow you to do it to me again.  So I think it would be best if we simply parted ways.\"\n\nI'm just not sure OP is at that point.  There was an awful situation involving the start of her marriage, but it doesn't seem as if OP feels like they were terrible people before that.  And if OP's faith really is as important to her as she says it is...\n\nI don't think I can over-emphasize just how valued parents, and especially mothers, are in Islam.  There's a famous hadith (or saying of the Prophet Muhammad) where someone asked him who was the person most deserving of his good companionship.  The Prophet replied \"Your mother.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Your mother\" the Prophet replied a second time.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Your mother\" the Prophet replied a third time.\n\n\"And then?\" the Prophet was asked a fourth time.\n\nFinally the Prophet Muhammad replied, \"And then your father.\"\n\nIn the Qur'an, literally right after Allah (God) commands that we only worship Him, He reminds us to respect our parents:\n\n>For your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And honour your parents. If one or both of them reach old age in your care, never say to them \u02f9even\u02fa \u2018ugh,\u2019 nor yell at them. Rather, address them respectfully.  (17:23)\n\nI know Reddit probably feels all kinds of ways about Islam, and what I just wrote.  But the thing is, it doesn't actually matter what I, or you, or the rest of Reddit believes about the status of parents and mothers in Islam is.  It only matters what OP believes.  She seems like a kind soul who was unbearably hurt, and can't see her way past that right now.  But if she really does look to her faith for comfort, I can't imagine that the way she responded to her mother literally crying for forgiveness won't begin to...gnaw at her.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, and maybe OP is capable of casting her parents aside without a second thought.  Ok then.  I just remember how worried she was about her FIL, and how she thought people were being \"mean\" to him (even though they were doing so in defense of *her*).  That doesn't seem like the kind of person that can cast... anyone away.  Much less her mother.\n\nI'm not entirely sure, but I think that perhaps forgiveness is seen as more... obligatory? in Christianity than it is in Islam.  But just because something isn't an \"obligation\" doesn't mean it's not a good thing to do.  When we pray, there are \"obligatory\" prayers and \"good to do\" prayers, and most people end up doing both because why not?  Why wouldn't you want to \"err on the side of caution\" as it were?  Be better than you're absolutely required to be.\n\n>The reward of an evil deed is its equivalent. But whoever pardons and seeks reconciliation, then their reward is with Allah. He certainly does not like the wrongdoers. (42:40)\n\nI know it might seem like I'm \"lecturing\" OP or whatever.  I really am not.  I truly, honestly believe that hate, bitterness, and anger are literally toxic to a person's health.  I think that if someone is able to \"lance the wound\" so to speak, and let go of some of that anger, I think they would be happier.\n\nThere have been people in my life that have treated me... callously, at times.  And while I was deeply hurt and upset at the time, I grew to understand something.  I could choose to forgive them, even if they never asked for it, even if they never even knew I was angry at them to begin with.  Even if they didn't change what bothered me.\n\nBecause in the end, I can't control what they do or what they say or how they think.  I *can* control how I choose to respond to them.  And I choose to respond to them with... understanding.  With a willingness to accept that they might not always say or do the \"right\" thing, but they never meant to purposefully hurt me.  They were just caught up in their own private chaos, and didn't realize how it spilled out.\n\nPossibly you think I'm \"enabling an abuser\" or something like that.  I dunno.  I just want OP to feel at peace.  I want her baby to have a happy life surrounded by people who love him.  I just think it's possible OP's parents could be some of those people.", "Nta they are just trying to make sure your children turn out Muslim.", "Info: OP, if you had given birth to a daughter, would they have been so eager to reconcile? \n \nJust trying to understand their motivation here.
