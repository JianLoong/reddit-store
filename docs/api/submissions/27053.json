I was petting the cat when my neighbour popped out and said that he\u2019s been out there all week - I was on holiday this week and this was my first day back - the cat was crying and begging. The cat was infested in fleas, skinny and absolutely filthy. I said maybe I\u2019ll take him in for the evening and take him to the vets two doors down to try and find his owners.\n\nThe next day, we scanned for a chip but we didn\u2019t find anything. I took him home and booked an assessment from the vets. They found that he was an adult male cat, not neutered and not microchipped (this is a legal requirement where I live), had a broken tooth and was covered in scratches meaning he\u2019s been in fights. They gave me two options: give him up to the RSPCA (an animal welfare shelter) or keep him. I decided to keep him.\n\n\nI booked his neutering for a month and a half later as the vets were full, I vowed to find his owners by posting on missing pet sites. However, I didn\u2019t have the time or resources to print out posters.\n\nI washed the cat, de-flead him, fed him, bought him toys, neutered & microchipped him. He was integrating with my other animals. I even got his blood work done. He was well looked after with me. This week, we decided to start letting him out as he kept trying to escape out of our window but we fitted him with an Apple AirTag.\n\nOn Friday, we couldn\u2019t find him. We tracked him to an area where a group of people were standing around. We asked if they had seen a cat and immediately the woman started shouting saying I stole her cat, she was calling me names. She was threatening to call the police. I couldn\u2019t even explain what happened to her.\n\nMy partner, to de escalate the situation said that he will transfer all legal ownership to her and she can keep the cat. He wouldn\u2019t listen to me and asked me to go home whilst he transferred the details.\n\nI\u2019m really annoyed as I truly looked after that cat whilst they didn\u2019t take the necessary precautions to care for him. I\u2019m also annoyed at my partner for buckling down but he was trying to de-escalate the situation.\n\nEveryone has told me I\u2019m NTA but I do feel really bad about the situation and I also miss this cat so much.", "created_utc": 1694943988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kwhx0/aita_for_taking_in_what_i_thought_was_a_stray_cat/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The cat is chipped and in your name, they can not claim anything from you.", "NTA\n\nAnd law around pets in most places says the owner is the one who pays most of vet bills.

If the cat was in the condition you say he was, his quality of life was horrible & you may have actually saved his life by taking him in.\n\nAt this point, your husband volunteered to give a cat you've been caring for (& have records of taking care of) back to the person who didn't take care of him, so there's not much you can do.

Should the animal manage to do so, you can welcome him in. Then, in a paroxysm of epiphany about the welfare of the cat, the local birds, and all those other neighbor's unsprayed stoops and foliages, you'd not need to let him back out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
