We have different seats on the plane because the flight is packed and overbooked. I tell her it\u2019s fine it\u2019s just 4 hours. She then comes to my seat and tells me the woman sitting next to her is willing to trade seats with me. I literally said \u201cgive me a break\u201d and told her no.

However once we get to \"don't talk to me until we get home\", I feel like that crosses from \"cranky\" to a downright gross way to talk to your partner.\n\nSomeone might be overly complaining without being fully aware of how cranky or nagging they're sounding. No one says \"You're not allowed to talk to me all day\" by accident.\n\nPlus, when two people are bickering and one is communicating more clearly and explicitly (girlfriend) and the other is being silently resentful and passive aggressive until they get downright mean (OP), I tend to judge the latter more.\n\nI'd say either ESH or YTA...it teeters between the two.

I can be quite an active sleeper, and have shared beds with other active sleepers, and yep sometimes people get knocked off (especially if it's a small bed).

I'm sorry I knocked you off, that must've been a pain,\" and similarly polite discourse for the person who got knocked off to respond \"Oh thanks, yeah it was a crappy way to wake up but it wasn't on purpose!\". I'd be cranky if a partner pushed me off by accident and then was rude about it though.
