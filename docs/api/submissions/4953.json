We get to the airport and she\u2019s complaining more, I tell her I\u2019m tired and let me rest, don\u2019t talk to me until we get home and she gets all mad and complains. We have different seats on the plane because the flight is packed and overbooked. I tell her it\u2019s fine it\u2019s just 4 hours. She then comes to my seat and tells me the woman sitting next to her is willing to trade seats with me. I literally said \u201cgive me a break\u201d and told her no.
