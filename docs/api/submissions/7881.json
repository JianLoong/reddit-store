When I got home, I let her know there was ice cream in the freezer and that she was welcome to help herself if she wanted any. I ate half a pint yesterday, and roommate didn't eat any.\n\nToday, I was stressed while working (wfh), and I ended up stress eating all the remaining 3.5 pints of ice cream while my roommate was out. When she got home, she saw there was no ice cream left and completely flipped out when I told her I finished it all. She called me a glutton with no self control, and that my offer to share ice cream was really disingenuous if I was just going to pig out on it before anyone else could get to it. And she had been looking forward to a treat after work, and that I had raised her hopes up for nothing. \n\nI apologized, but pointed out that she could've told me she wanted some and that I should save some. Or that she could've had some last night when I first brought it home. She just lashed out at me, saying this happens way too much. That I'll pretend to be generous with food, but then gorge myself  before anyone else could get any. She then ordered doordash and shut herself in her room.\n\nI get that she was disappointed when she got home, but I feel like it was my ice cream and I was being nice enough to even offer any at all and that she could've let me know if she wanted me to save any.

I would be hella annoyed if you did that on a regular basis tbh, sounds like this was just the last straw for her. I would kinda feel like somebody was fucking with me if I were her.

It's not like a week went by and she didn't try to eat it, it was literally the next day. Maybe you should stop offering her your food that you then eat anyway, after apologizing for dicking her around so many times.

Also, you can\u2019t expect people to eat food as soon as they are offered the food; 24 hours is not a long time.

In your situation, after making a point of offering my roommate something, I probably would have kept that in mind and saved at least a little for her, at least for the first week or so after offering.

Food gets eaten, a lot of people emotionally eat sometimes, everything is replaceable and was theirs. Their roommate was completely out of line for getting nuclear level pissed over something that wasn't theirs to begin with. If she had a bad day she can buy her own snacks to emotionally eat!\n\nAnd OP clearly acknowledges they're struggling...there's no point in a bunch of people (their roommate included) berating and preaching at them. They KNOW and whether they're working on it or not is their business.\n\nAnyways OP if I was you I would just smooth over any hurt feelings with an apology and buy her a pint and then say you're 100% sticking to no sharing and won't offer again since you don't want it to mess up the dynamic or whatever.", "The reason she is TA is because she offered the ice cream. She shouldn't offer it and then eat all of it. That would be very frustrating to be on the receiving side. If she might binge eat it she should never offer it.", "Poor \"mental health\" doesnt trump everyone elses feelings or experiences.", "I hate that they think excusing all horrible behaviour is ok because its attached to a feely issue.", "How was she supposed to know she was going to binge eat? That's not something you know ahead of time. She was just trying to be nice, and told her roommate she could have some if she wanted. Her roommate didn't express that she wanted any in any way, shape or form, so how was OP supposed to know she was supposed to save some for the roommate?", "It\u2019s an ice cream. She had a breakdown. If you value ice cream that wasn\u2019t even explicitly bought for you more than the mental wellbeing of the person you live with, you are a terrible & self-centred person. Buy your own goddamn ice cream, especially as she never even reciprocated OP\u2019s acts of generosity.", "Oh for sure, any weight issues or eating issues are a huge hot topic on reddit. There was a post about a girl claiming she'd be \"starving\" at her sisters house because she claimed there was barely any food. Everyone sided with the OP saying that her sister had an eating disorder for not eating a lot of food. Turns out the OP was also 5'4\" 170lbs as a 14 year old girl and people were saying \"thats not bad\" and didn't think it was just the OP grossly over eating."]}
