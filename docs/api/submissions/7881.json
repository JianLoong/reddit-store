We don't grocery shop together, but I have no problem with it if she ever wants any of my food. In fact, sometimes I'll tell her \"Hey, I got milk/ice cream/cookies/whatever - feel free to help yourself.\" She occasionally takes me up on this. I don't ever eat her food, aside from if we're cooking together or if she made something and directly offered it to me. \n\nYesterday, I went to the grocery store, and Ben and Jerry's was on sale (2 pints for $4). So I bought 4 pints of some of my favorite flavors, but also one that I knew was my roommate's favorite. When I got home, I let her know there was ice cream in the freezer and that she was welcome to help herself if she wanted any. I ate half a pint yesterday, and roommate didn't eat any.\n\nToday, I was stressed while working (wfh), and I ended up stress eating all the remaining 3.5 pints of ice cream while my roommate was out. When she got home, she saw there was no ice cream left and completely flipped out when I told her I finished it all. She called me a glutton with no self control, and that my offer to share ice cream was really disingenuous if I was just going to pig out on it before anyone else could get to it. And she had been looking forward to a treat after work, and that I had raised her hopes up for nothing. \n\nI apologized, but pointed out that she could've told me she wanted some and that I should save some. Or that she could've had some last night when I first brought it home. She just lashed out at me, saying this happens way too much. That I'll pretend to be generous with food, but then gorge myself  before anyone else could get any. She then ordered doordash and shut herself in her room.\n\nI get that she was disappointed when she got home, but I feel like it was my ice cream and I was being nice enough to even offer any at all and that she could've let me know if she wanted me to save any.

I would be hella annoyed if you did that on a regular basis tbh, sounds like this was just the last straw for her. I would kinda feel like somebody was fucking with me if I were her. I was on your side till the part about her saying it happens a lot. That's super rude to offer people treat type stuff only to eat the stuff yourself in less than 24 hours. It's not like a week went by and she didn't try to eat it, it was literally the next day. Maybe you should stop offering her your food that you then eat anyway, after apologizing for dicking her around so many times.

Also, you can\u2019t expect people to eat food as soon as they are offered the food; 24 hours is not a long time.

In your situation, after making a point of offering my roommate something, I probably would have kept that in mind and saved at least a little for her, at least for the first week or so after offering.

I wish I\u2019d done it much earlier in my life. Find a therapist who can help you unpack why you eat and treats this appropriately as a form of addiction, because binge eating during times of emotional distress is absolutely a form of addictive behaviour.", "I understand.
