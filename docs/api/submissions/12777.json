I missed my mom like crazy and would try to talk to my stepmother about her, but she didn\u2019t seem interested. Every time my mother was mentioned, she\u2019d stop engaging in conversation and just go on her phone or walk away.\n\nWhen I was 17, my grandmother told me that she was creating something special for my 18th birthday. I asked for a hint, and she said it had to do with someone I missed a lot. That night, I cried a lot. I knew she was going to create something to do with my mother.\n\nA while after that, my dad called me. He said he had bad news while sniffling. He said that my stepmother threw away all my mom\u2019s possessions. Not one thing was left. Not even sentimental items. I started crying, and my dad comforted me over the phone and then started crying with me.\n\nI know you aren\u2019t supposed to make major decisions when you are emotional because it can lead to reckless behavior. But I was so mad and sad that I decided to drive to my dad's house.\n\nMy grandmother opened the door, but I just walked past her. I went straight to my stepmother. I started yelling at her, calling her something along the lines of jealous and vindictive. Bitch. I said a lot of vile words. I told her I never wanted to talk to her again. She tried to apologize, but I just blocked out everything she was saying. I ignored what everyone was saying and just left.\n\nSince then, my half brother was born. I have nothing against him, but I barely visit him. My dad forgave my stepmother, but I can\u2019t. My family recently had a get-together and asked if I would be coming. I asked if my stepmother would be there, and my aunt said yes. I then declined. My aunt told me to get over her throwing away my mom\u2019s possessions and be there for my half brother. My cousins and other aunts and uncles have since messaged me to say similar stuff and have been really pressuring. I almost dropped out of my top-tier college due to being depressed, but I feel like they might have a point.

Or was it clear that these were sentimental items that your dad was saving for you?", "NTA, though\u2026\n\nYou\u2019re hurt, but you\u2019re distancing yourself from your actual family by avoiding her.

Your stepmother is a vile human being. If she wanted to box up your mom's stuff and save it for you except for a few things to keep in your bedroom that's one thing.", "Do you really want to miss out on family gatherings just because she is there? NTA, but for your own sake, sanity and peace, let it go. You do not have to forgive her, or even try to like her. When you're at a family event and she is there, simply say hi and keep it moving. You don't have to make conversation with her. But I think it's best to not allow her to prevent you from attending events/gatherings. And if she tries to make conversation with you and you don't want to engage simply say, \"Look I've said hello to you but I do not wish to have any further conversation than that.\" I'm truly sorry that evil woman threw away your moms belongings, but don't allow her to prevent you from going to family gatherings. I'm sure that's the way she wants it, to avoid having your presence. Don't give her the satisfaction.", "It's entirely valid for you to feel hurt and upset by your stepmother's actions. Throwing away your late mother's possessions was insensitive and disregarded your feelings and the sentimental value those items held for you. Your pain is understandable, and your reaction to the situation is a natural response to feeling betrayed and hurt.\n\nHowever, it has been several years since the incident, and it's important to consider the potential for growth and change in both yourself and your stepmother. Holding onto this anger and resentment may not be helpful for you in the long run, and it could negatively impact your relationship with your half brother, who has no connection to your stepmother's actions.\n\nYou're not the asshole for feeling hurt and betrayed, but it might be worth considering whether you can find a way to work through your feelings and potentially forgive your stepmother for the sake of your family relationships. This doesn't mean you have to forget what happened, but finding a way to accept it and move forward could be beneficial for you and those around you.\n\nYou may want to seek therapy or counseling to help process your feelings about the situation and explore whether forgiveness is possible. Remember that forgiveness is a personal choice, and it's ultimately up to you to decide what's best for your emotional well-being.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
