I asked for a hint, and she said it had to do with someone I missed a lot. That night, I cried a lot. I knew she was going to create something to do with my mother.\n\nA while after that, my dad called me. He said he had bad news while sniffling.

I started crying, and my dad comforted me over the phone and then started crying with me.\n\nI know you aren\u2019t supposed to make major decisions when you are emotional because it can lead to reckless behavior.

She tried to apologize, but I just blocked out everything she was saying. I ignored what everyone was saying and just left.\n\nSince then, my half brother was born. I have nothing against him, but I barely visit him. My dad forgave my stepmother, but I can\u2019t. My family recently had a get-together and asked if I would be coming. I asked if my stepmother would be there, and my aunt said yes. I then declined. My aunt told me to get over her throwing away my mom\u2019s possessions and be there for my half brother.

Which family member will tell someone to stop speaking about her mother.  But like I said, I'm petty. Maybe it's more reasonable to cut ties with these people...", "I also can't get past the father. He forgave her and expected OP to forgive her? The fact that he stayed with her sucks, he should have left her.", "Very well put.", "I'm even angrier now after reading that.  She didn't even care about how her actions would affect her step daughter, just saving her marrige.", "If it IS the same, and husband did not immediately divorce her, he deserves total estrangement from his kid! This is just psychotic and evil! This is like the worst thing you can do to a kid, completely erase their dead mom! I'm side-eyeing dad hard now, if it is the same person.", "I agree these posts are very similar, but the stepmom says she married the father when the daughter was 15. Here, the 23 year old daughter says her dad remarried over 9 years ago, which would have made her no older than 14. It\u2019s possible somebody either made a mistake or fudged the details (especially if stepmom wrote both posts).", "There\u2019s too many details for this not the be the same\u2026", "If it IS the same, and husband did not immediately divorce her, he deserves total estrangement from his kid!

The definition of a wicked stepmother.", "That\u2019s 100% without a doubt the stepmom. WOW\n\nOP you are NTA", "Did you actually read the post before commenting? She answered all these questions in it. ???", "Call me cynical but I bet they're both written by the same person. They both have a good number of short, terse sentences and they're both (pretty well) written at roughly similar levels of fluency.  \n\nI just don't believe in this sort of coincidence on advice seeking relationship subreddits anymore, I've seen too many writing prompts.", "[removed]", "Yes exactly! Haha I just responded to another commenter who also thinks it could be the stepmom. Ugh, I guess the dad didn't leave her yet....", "That line got me, too.", "Not really sure. She wrote the post five years ago. She said she married the husband for years before that the stepdaughter was 17 turning 18 at the time she wrote the post. So I mean that would line up. Dad remarried 9 years ago. So she would be 23 now", "Uh no she didn\u2019t? I just read THIS post. Now the stepmoms post actually answered the questions but you know good on you", "*\u2019Because they are her family\u2019*\n\nOne of the oldest and absolutely irrelevant excuses in the book\u2026smh", "I also was wondering the same thing! Given how similar the posts are, it seems much more likely that it's the same woman pretending to be the stepdaughter.", "Yes, so many similar turns of phrase such as calling the university \"top-tier\" etc. \n\nI believe both are one person's writing exercise, but it's all certainly very well written!", "\"Top-tier\" is the tip off. \n\nFor sure this is the same person.", "u/Previous_Barnac is a bot that stole this from u/Away-Living5278. Downvote and report as spam.", "Nope, the post says he managed to forgive her for erasing is late wife and the mother of his child.", "Oh the, \u201cI said many vile things\u201d, if your that mad and still refuse to apologize or forgive, you wouldn\u2019t regret saying something like that.\n\n\nAlso a throw-away post.", "Just read that one and it was prettier horrific as well", "The stepmom said the daughter was 17 and that she had married the dad \u201ctwo years ago.\u201d That\u2019s why I think the daughter was at least 15 at the time of the marriage. But again, it\u2019s certainly possible some details were fudged in an attempt to hide her identity.", "But she did, she said the Stepmom admitted to doing it. Also my bad, I reread my comment and it was overly harsh, sorry for that.", "This. It\u2019s VERY similarly written. Stepmom is so thirsty she\u2019s here trying to see if Reddit still hates her. SPOILER ALERT\u2026. We do.", "That could also be explained by them living in the same house for as long as they did.", "Where's the link for that one?", "She married him 2 years ago at the time of the post met 4 years ago", "No worries I saw the text saying stepmom admitted it but there wasn\u2019t really a timeline nor did I know about the stepmom post so based on the very little info I had it was like \u201cwhat\u2019s the background? How bad is the stepmom? How long ago did it happen?\u201d Etc but once I saw the stepmom post yeah\u2026 stepmom evil but as mentioned unless the entire family jumped up to stepmoms defense. Daughter is cutting off everyone - and I think going to events even if she is there, isn\u2019t end of the world as she plays the \u201cwhy do I hear this buzzing?\u201d Very polite and cold and pretty much acting like she doesn\u2019t exist like she does is but in front of her and still see family. But that\u2019s also if she wants to have anything to do with that family and she doesn\u2019t see them outside of the events.
