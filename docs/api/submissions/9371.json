{"id": 9371, "submission_id": "10w358h", "title": "AITA for walking out of our Christmas celebration because of a gift I received?", "selftext": "I (22f) have a very small immediate family that I celebrate Christmas with, and we always get together on Christmas Day to celebrate. Most of that side of the family (My mom\u2019s side), especially my aunt (61f), are mostly a judgmental bunch who like to constantly point out when I look different, they\u2019ve done this since I was about 10 years old. When I was overweight, my aunt and cousin would like to point it out. When I lost a lot of weight after high school, I was asked if I\u2019ve been purposefully skipping meals or have an ED. Aka, nothing I do is really enough for them, they always have to find some flaw to point out. \n\nBut anyways, to the point of this post, most of our celebration was going well. But, towards the start of the evening, I saw my uncle talking to my aunt and him looking hesitant before my aunt handed me a gift. My uncle said to me before I opened it, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t my idea, it was hers\u201d, pointing to my aunt. And what was in there, was one of those long inflatable tube men you normally see large ones of at car shops, but a mini version (Just look up inflatable tube man and it\u2019ll come up right away). Normally I wouldn\u2019t be so upset over a gag gift, but this one specifically hurt because I have TS (Tourette\u2019s Syndrome), and it was really bad when I was younger to the point where I developed severe neck pain from the certain tics I had. And surprise, my aunt used to make fun of me and compare me to one of those things when my tics were really bad, and it hurt me, a lot. And I\u2019ve said many times to her that this was one of the things that really bothered me about myself, even when I was younger.\n\nSo of course, I started to cry because that\u2019s one of the things I was extremely self conscious about. Most of my family was supportive of me and asked her why she would do that, while my aunt and my mom (58f), just told me that it was a joke and that I shouldn\u2019t be so upset about it. So I walked out of the house and locked myself in my mom\u2019s car and got my crying over and done with. I would have left tbh, but I can\u2019t drive because of my TS and another medical condition. \n\nI eventually had to come back in because it was freezing and I couldn\u2019t feel my hands after that (Another medical condition). We kinda continued as normal, but I feel like I really put a damper on everyone\u2019s mood and made my aunt to look like an asshole in front of everyone. I\u2019m asking a bit late because I\u2019m still, even after months, getting extreme anxiety over thinking about this, thinking I overreacted and could\u2019ve found a better way to handle this.

You didn't make your aunt look like an asshole. Your aunt made herself look like an asshole. What a terrible, awful thing to tease someone about. Your aunt and mother were clearly the Mean Girls in high school, and never grew out of it.", "NTA\n\nY'know, my child has one of those little desk-sized inflatable tube men. It is the *only* thing they asked for a couple years back for Christmas. I think they were... 10? 11?\n\nIt's super annoying, and they hated it after a day. It's really loud, making it impossible to focus on anything you might be *doing* at the desk. It's cute when it's inflated and just looks like a mess on the desk at *any other time*.\n\nIt's a $5 crappy gift even if it's something you *wanted* and asked for, lol.\n\nThe fact that your aunt purchased this specifically to make fun of you is completely unacceptable.\n\nI'm really tired of people trying to pass off bullying as just a joke, or just a prank. \n\nBullies ALWAYS think what they've done is funny. Of course they say it's just a joke. Whether it's intended to be funny or cruel, it doesn't excuse *attacking someone else*. And that includes this kind of teasing. *Especially* since you've already let her know this \"joke\" hurt you growing up.\n\n... as for your mother, whether she's typically a bully or not, she is *enabling* your aunt's bullying. Some people care way more about maintaining the facade of a \"happy day\" more than they care about what's right.\n\nI'm sorry your mother is being that shallow. But she's being the AH, not you.\n\nYour aunt is a giant AH for deliberately trying to hurt you at this occasion. Not you.\n\n>My uncle said to me before I opened it, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t my idea, it was hers\u201d, pointing to my aunt.\n\nYour uncle should have called out her bullshit right there. Loudly enough that the family could hear. \"No we will NOT give niece this highly offensive gift poking at her diagnosed medical condition\". He couldn't have stopped her, I'm sure, but he could have spoken up, and chose to watch the bullying instead (while saying he's not complicit). That makes him complicit in the behavior, and for that he's also a little bit of an AH. Not you.\n\nThe rest of your family sounds like they tried to be supportive. But I don't hear that anyone raked your aunt over the coals or really defended you, and for that they *might* be a little bit of an AH. Not you.\n\nAll you did was have emotions (which we cannot control), which suited the situation, and cry (a valid reaction to those emotions). When someone was invalidating your emotions, you left the situation, which is what any mature person would do. It's what you *should* do, when you're feeling emotional.\n\nYou're not the AH. Not even a little bit. \n\nFinal note: \n\n> mostly a judgmental bunch who like to constantly point out when I look different\n\nMost people who do this are really insecure. They don't like themselves, even if they are conceited people, they are constantly worried about what others will think of them/the people around them.\n\nBecause they feel small and petty and worthless, they want others to feel that way too. It's hard to do, but if you can make yourself realize how untrue their sentiments are, and take away their power to hurt you, it makes it less likely you will ever *become* as small and petty as they are.\n\nBe nice to yourself. You're a person and deserving of respect, just like any other person.", "Your aunt is a toxic cow and you are NTA.", "NTA at all. You expressed your feelings.
