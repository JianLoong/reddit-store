We (26F and husband 27M) are out of state staying at a cabin we rented by the lake side. The whole family has been enjoying going fishing, swimming in the lake, going out to together in the small town, and evening fires. However, my husband and I have been staying in the same cabin as my BIL (30M),  his GF (40F) and her two kids (5F and 3M). The whole trip was spent hearing my BIL's GF just scream at the kids and even punished them by sending them to bed at 6pm after dinner cause she didn't want to deal with them.\n\nI told her that she shouldn't be using bedtime as a punishment, screaming when they are acting like kids, yelling when they say their full but hasn't eatten all their food. She basically told me I don't understand since I don't have any children and that  kids are difficult. My husband and I have spent some time with them, and the kids seem to really like us. The little boy told me he likes me and my husband, when I was basically watching him at a restaruant while his mom just screamed at her daughter for moving in her chair.\n\nIt got to a point that one of the days, the GF wanted us to watch the kids for about an hour or so while she went to smoke weed (where we are weed is legal to smoke). I said no, since I was on vacation and they aren't my kids I don't have to watch them. She tried to push since she is dating my BIL that I shouldn't be fighting watching the kids. To which, I said \"You're dating my BIL and not married.\" Again I added how the kids aren't my responsibility to watch while you get high.\n\nShe got angry at me and told my BIL, who talked to my husband. Nothing going further than that. My BIL is kinda a push over and tends to not fight about things.\n\nMy husband was also mad that the GF tried go pawn the kids off on us for her to get high. We love the kids and care for them when we are around them, but now there is tension between us and the GF. The whole family doesn't know the situation cause no one has said anything, but a few have an idea since they hear the way she acts around the kids.\n\nThe GF is mad and claiming I'm the asshole. Maybe I am for how rude I was, but she has been awful to be around ALL vacation. I only put up with her for peace and the kids.

I know you might like the kids, yet <not your circus, not your monkeys>. She is such a character and super entitled.", "She is inviting her mother up next year to be her personal babysitter so she can go do whatever. She even said \"Yaaaay free labor\" and looked directly at me. I didn't say anything cause we were at another cabin for a family fire.", "Originally it was supposed to be my in laws, BIL with GF and kids, and my husband and I. My in laws didn't come last minute due to not feeling well, so it was just the five of us. Next year we have already planned on rooming just my husband and I.", "Exactly!! I have my own childhood trauma from my parents playing weird mind games to turn myself and my sister against each parent. I plan on having my own kids and plan to do better.", "Yeah she is not a great person but her kids are so sweet. I absolutely adore them. I know they're not my responsibility, but it makes me feel so bad when she just verbally attacks them.", "Well the GF not only yells but threatens and does places hands on the kids in public/in private.", "I only said because she screams at them in public and threatens to puts hands on them while in public. I don't believe the way she is doing it is right,  sure I'm not a mom so yeaaah I don't get it. But I work with kids and the way she acts towards them is close to abus!ve. I only get a small visual while we are together.", "Next year we aren't rooming together. We were supposed to room with them and my in laws, but in laws weren't feeling good so bailed on trip. The BIL GF says she is getting her mom to come as a free sitter so she can go drinking and get high.", "Me too.", "NTA what a nightmare.", "Who pays for the cabin? Any way you can be in a cabin away from them?", "If she's actually doing something phisically abusive, then, by all means, please intervene. \n\nBut don't try to dictate how their family works (such as complain about bed time being used as punishment) if you don't want to actually get a role in the raising of the kids.", "You misunderstood me!! I agree with you that your sister in law is wrong but unless she physically abused her children stay out of her business as far as how she interacts with her children!!! Best thing is to limit your exposure to her and her toxic behavior!!! That way you won\u2019t see what\u2019s happening and you never have to deal with her and she doesn\u2019t have to deal with you", "We all put money together to afford the cabin for this year cause it was supposed to house 8 but the in laws bailed due to not feeling well so just BIL, his GF, her kids, and my husband and I. We have the entire first floor away from them, and today is our last day of vacation we leave in the morning.", "She threatens but most she has done that I've seen is hit the head or hit hands. I can only assume buy its hard to tell. I think all she does is scream at them for just being kids.", "Sorry, my bad. Text can be easily misunderstood.", "There is such a thing as emotional and mental abuse. We don\u2019t have more info to go off of but the gf seems to be treading close to emotional/mental abuse if she is screaming/berating kids just because they moved in their chair and are behaving like normal kids.\nCPS does remove kids for all sorts of abuse in addition to physical abuse. Just because it isn\u2019t physical doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not abuse. I\u2019m not saying the gf is an abuser but I don\u2019t believe people should keep quiet when kids are being abused, physical or not. \n\nNTA", "I've been suggested by a family member to call CPS, cause if abuse is going on my husband and I could get in trouble for not reporting. Its making my stomach hurt cause I want to help these kids but I don't know what goes on at their home, but if this is how they act around us who knows how they are at home."]}
