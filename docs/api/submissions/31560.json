No parties.\n\nWould have went alright had it not been for the fact that they invited Emily over. It was very awkward with me giving a tense smile and saying a very strained hello. Had lunch with everyone. Then she sat next to me on the couch and placed one of her hands on my thigh.\n\nAt that point I panicked. I was startled and I told everyone \u2018Thanks for coming, but I have to go now.\u2019\n\nWent to a bookstore and didn\u2019t go home until two hours later.

They deliberately made it so you'd feel obligated to stay and be polite when your real desire would be to leave. They wanted to pressure you to get back with your ex using the whole situation for that purpose.\n\nYou endured as much as you could and then your ex pushed things further by putting her hand on your leg. You did well not to leave straight from the start when you saw her, and I wouldn't blame you if you had.\n\nTell your parents and any other flying monkey that they know as well as you do that you were set up and you did nothing wrong by leaving when you did. You don't owe them making up with your cheating ex just to be polite.", "NTA. This was not a party for you but an event for your parents to get you and Emily in the same room. Your parents have firmly violated your boundaries in favour of Emily.", "Your impropriety!? What about Emily's putting her hand on your thigh? What about your parents' inviting someone they KNEW you would be uncomfortable with to your birthday party? NTA!", "NTA\n\nIt's inappropriate for your parents to keep pushing for you to go back to being a couple with her when you do not want to. I think you need to have a talk with your parents on whether or not they invited her, or if she showed up with their friend. And how it makes you feel that they aren't listening to your very clear 'no's on this subject.", "NTA. Impropriety? Lol. This isn\u2019t Downton Abbey.\n\nThe girl cheated on you. Once a cheater always a cheater. Your parents don\u2019t seem to respect your feelings.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo your parents want to offer you as a sacrifice to the daughter of their boss for their own financial gain and job security.", "NTA. Once again a parent putting their status above their child's comfort.  What on earth is to be gained by putting you two together again? Oh yes, pleasing their friends in that their daughter isn't so awful for cheating, as the couple have got back together. Warn your parents that if they try this again you will just go on and on about Emily cheating. Loudly. \"What, we should get back together so you can cheat on me again?\" \"No, I don't want your hand on my leg, I don't know which other legs it's been on...\" That should do it...", "Nta\n\nThe party was for you, but you weren't the host, so you weren't a bad host. Your parents were bad hosts by inviting someone they knew would make the guest of honor (you)  feel uncomfortable. \n\nYou would have been completely in your right to make a small scene when the ex touched you,  mainly or loud, infront of everyone telling her that you never want her to touch you again. No one should be touched without their consent like that, and her being called out might be embarrassing enough for her, and all the adults, to stop trying to make it happen.", "NTA. Not even a little.", "You were not the host.  You were the victim.", "NTA. They ruined your party by inviting someone they knew hurt you. I would avoid them until they apologized. Also, you learned a lesson\u2026 don\u2019t dare someone that close to the family again as your family has shone they will not prioritize you.", "NTA, have you asked your parents how they feel about cheating, apparently they think it is ok and should be forgiven if they are trying to get you to get back with her.  Ask them if one of them cheated would it be ok?  Would they want to stay with a cheater?  If their answers are no, then why are they trying to push you into being with a cheater?  Ask them if they will be ok with grandchildren being fathered by someone other than you. Then lastly, ask them if they like her so much, why not adopt her since she makes such a good daughter.  Good luck!", "NTA. Your parents shouldn't tell you who to date. They shouldn't throw parties to try to force you back together with your cheating ex, just because THEY like her. And the fact that they would want you to give someone who cheated on you another chance means they aren't prioritizing your health or well being.", "NTA. \n\nIt was highly inappropriate of your parents to invite your ex-girlfriend when you made it very clear that you did not want to be together with her again. \n\nJust because they can't seem to stomach the fact that you broke up with her does not give them the right to interfere in your love life. It is your decision alone with whom you are together or not. \n\nIf anything, it is them who should apologize. About whose feelings do they care more? The feelings of their own son or about the feelings of his ex-girlfriend?", "NTA at all.\n\nThey made YOUR birthday about what THEY wanted.\n\nI can\u2019t believe they know she cheated on you and are still trying to push you to get back together. Ridiculous.", "NTA. Sorry, but you can't get back together with Emily again just because it would be so convenient for everyone else.", "NTA - This relationship had too much pressure on it to begin with. You both are too young - you began dating at 16/15. Your parents expect you to marry.  You both need a chance to date other people.", "You know, maybe i\u2019m out of the loop here, but imo it\u2019s also an \u201cimpropriety\u201d to spring the guest of honours cheating ex on them in a pathetic attempt to get them back together.\nNaw Op you did nothing wrong, i\u2019m guessing had YOU cheated on her they would be singing a VERY different tune eh\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA  I agree with the others who said your parents manipulated this situation to back you into a corner where you'd feel obligated to stay despite Emily's presence. Good parents would respect that you and Emily broke up and that you have every right to choose or reject any particular woman as your romantic partner. So your parents failed there already. They've also repeatedly said they want you to end up together even though you keep saying no.\n\nThe core problem is that their loyalty is divided between you and Emily. So I think if you want to solve your long-term problem you need to first define, what is exactly IS the problem.\n\nAs I see it, the root cause of this is probably that your father works for Emily's father. So there is a power dynamic there that maybe your parents feel they have to like Emily so your dad can keep his job. Although it's possible your mom really bonded with Emily as the \"daughter she never had\", I think it's more likely that your mom just went with the flow that she HAD to like her boss's daughter, so she did, and over time it's just grown roots and become fixed into their lifestyle. Likewise, even if your parents retire and are no longer in the monetary power of Emily's father, their whole social life is likely built on Emily, Emily's father, their friends are probably the same people as Emily's father's friends, and so on. It's REALLY hard to make new friends as you get older so unwinding this problem could be really difficult for them as they could end up isolated. Obviously I'm extrapolating from a tiny amount of information but I'm just trying to show you how cutting off Emily could be awkward from their perspective.\n\nIn summary, I think any solution that involves cutting off Emily or her family is probably a non-starter for your parents, no matter how unjust that is to you.\n\nOn the other hand, your parents really should be more loyal to you than to Emily. And it could be that the real problem is they aren't loyal to you. Maybe there are even understandable reasons, but it doesn't matter. You should be able to count on their loyalty. \n\nSo the question is can you or can you not count on their loyalty, given that you understand they are in a difficult position. If you came up with a compromise solution that met your own needs as well as those of your parents (i.e. your dad not wanting to get fired or to lose his entire social network) would your parents implement it or would they shaft you in favor of Emily?\n\nDo your parents know Emily cheated? Would you feel comfortable telling them? Can you have a serious conversation with them and say: look, I am never going to get back together with Emily; I get that you work for her dad and she has to be in your social life at some level, but if she's at family parties then I'll need to leave. I would hope her parents would respect that her ex-boyfriend might not want her at his family functions, but even if they can't, I'd hope that YOU as MY parents, would respect it. Emily has her own family, I don't interfere in her family life and I'd really appreciate if you'd help me have my own family life without her constantly there.", "You didn't organize or invite anyone for this party, so you were not the \"host\" but rather the subject. It sounds like your parents meant well, and I can understand if they felt a little embarrassed, but so did you. Not the asshole.", "NTA, and I\u2019m so sorry. Your parents are another kind of backwards to side with your cheating ex over their own son.", "So, your parents want to sell out your happiness by ignoring your (reasonable, human) boundaries and forcing you back together with a woman who cheated on you, to advance their own position with their boss. They are disgusting beyond words.  \nNTA, your family ruined your birthday ambushing you and trying to manipulate you like this, and they should all be utterly ashamed of themselves.", "NTA.  Ask your mother if she would be okay with dad screwing the neighbor?", "NTA.  This wasn't a birthday party, it was an ambush.", "NTA your parents only done the party to force you back to your cheating ex. Can\u2019t believe your parents are on her side, because her daddy is their boss & most likely wants his money, via your marriage to her. It\u2019s best not to continue dating a cheater, they will think it\u2019s okay to cheat, as long as they apologise over & over. 2nd chance, turns into 9th chance. Try to get out of their house asap. As soon as you done that, give them an ultimatum stop trying to get you & cheater together or no contact.", "If my girlfriend cheated in me, my mom would spit in her face for that and not try to get us back together.   Cheating is a no go and once a cheater always a cheater don't take her back bro.", "NTA", "I don't necessarily think they care more about Emily and I think they're just being pushy boundary crossing parents that think the know what's best for you, but here's what you could say to get them to back down: \n\n\"Emily cheated on me and I have no interest in getting back together with her. The way you keep throwing us together makes me feel like you care about her more than you love me, like you don't care about my feelings or the fact that I got cheated on, because you just want to have a reason to have her around despite the fact that she did something horrible to me. You keep saying that she learned from her \"mistake\", but the fact that she keeps pushing boundaries, tells me that she STILL only cares about what she wants and not about what I feel at all. I don't know why you want me to be with such a selfish person. I was not the person who did a horrible thing, yet you expect me to sit here and be disrespected. You're putting the daughter you never had above the son you do have. So yes, I left because I did not feel safe in my own home.\"\n\nThey sound like parents who can't let go of the dream of their kids marrying their best friends kid and want you to \"be a bigger person and let it go\". Right now they're just focused on your actions.

And also breached your self-privacy by touching your leg. You're not an item, and your parents should've known that. And with them trying to push you into a relationship you don't want? They don't care about your self-interest.\n\nSo screw them. They're a poor excuse for parents and should be kneeling and pleading for your forgiveness spewing apologies!", "NTA.

It's pleasing their friend who is also THEIR BOSS. They put their careers over his happiness and mental health, I'm almost 100% sure of it", "They don't care about eithers feelings, this is absolutely about job security for the parents", "Good comment. Op tell your parents you don't appreciate their attempt to pimp you out to their boss's daughter, the girl that had cheated on you in the past. Tell them you value loyalty and honesty, and she showed neither. \n\nPersonally I would not have faulted you if you had walked out as soon as you saw Emily.

Tell them she is absolutely 100% off the table in terms of options for your dating life. She cheated, she hurt you, she fucked up and you have no obligation to be involved with her again. If she cheated once, what makes them think she won't do it again? Maybe bring up what others have and point out them trying to force a relationship for their gain, do they care about YOUR happiness?

Your parents and Emily\u2019s need to accept that Emily betrayed you and that should you choose to forgive her or work toward forgiving her, and give her another chance then it needs to be on your timetable and terms and not theirs.

I understand some of what you are feeling, and it sucks. My dad actually lived with my abusive ex after we broke up. My mom went to his wedding years later. He threatened to kill me and spent time in jail over it. I don't know why our parents don't choose us. Just know that it's not your fault. I would recommend therapy if you can.

You guys can keep trying to force me into situations with Emily, but it'll be a waste of time. Emily has already lost all my trust. You guys will too if you keep this up. All it'll do is make me even more disappointed with all of you.

OP is nta.", "Yes, but dealing with sexual assault and forcing yourself to sit through literally anything at all isn't. OP has every right to leave the situation. They have nothing physically keeping them there, only the protests of people that don't care about them. Awkward situations? Yeah, they happen and suck and you just gotta deal, but you're still allowed to remove yourself from said situation and advocate not to be put into that position again. I'm sorry something happened to where you believe you have to be forced to keep the peace and be the push-over that can't speak up for themselves or walk out, but this young person should never have to feel that feeling.

Think they get to have a hand in choosing who a legal adult is going to take as a life partner. \n\n(NTA op)", "The best thing to do in these situations is say very loudly, \" Can you stop touching me, please?\" Everyone knows what they are doing, and everyone has a clear understanding that you don't like it."]}
