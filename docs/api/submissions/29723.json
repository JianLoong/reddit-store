Most of this is in the last two weeks.\n\nMy MOH (26F), M, was in charge of planning my bachelorette party, which I wanted to be a surprise. We live in a city, but none of us live downtown, so I was hoping for a hotel room downtown and having a fun night out with friends, maybe a brunch. Most of the bridal party live locally, but two girls flew in for it.\n\nWhen M picked me up 2 weeks ago on Friday , I was excited to see where we were going and what we were doing. We ended up going to M\u2019s 1 bedroom townhome and spent the whole weekend there. There are 8 of us, so it was cramped and we kept running into issues with only 1 bathroom. On Friday night we had games and ordered pizza, Saturday we had a mimosa bar, went shopping, ordered food, and watched a movie, before parting ways on Sunday. It wasn\u2019t the bachelorette party of my dreams, or a particularly fun weekend, but it was ok, and I appreciated it.\n\nLast weekend, my fianc\u00e9 (32m), J, had just returned from a work trip. I hadn\u2019t caught him up to speed on the party, because there wasn\u2019t much to report. But when he returned, we were chatting and I told him about the party. He looked confused but said nothing else that evening. \n\nThe next day, I got a message from M asking to meet up to talk about \u201csomething.\u201d M revealed that J had given her a significant amount of money over a year ago, with the intention that it was used to pay for a bachelorette party. It would have been enough to pay for the entire bridal party to do a week long vacation out of town, including airfare, hotel, food, drinks, and fun. I wasn\u2019t expecting this type of event; a weekend downtown would have been wonderful, and even though the party at her home wasn\u2019t what I hoped for, I was fine with it because I got to be with all of my friends. She, instead, used the money to pay off credit card debt and hoped that no one would notice.\n\nI told her I needed some time to process and went home. After talking with J about it, I decided, that the best action would be to remove her from the wedding. I came to this decision because I don\u2019t feel I can trust her and don\u2019t want her to be standing next to me at my wedding. I slept on it overnight and sent her a text saying this on Monday.\n\nSince then, I have been getting texts from her mom and boyfriend telling me how awful I am for doing this since I didn\u2019t need a big party and M was able to financially benefit . My mom is also against removing her from the wedding, as she\u2019s like a sister to our family and it would be tragic for me to get married without M there. The rest of the bridal party is split, with half saying I shouldn\u2019t have kicked her out and the other half agreeing with me. M has called me crying because she already has her dress (J and I paid for all dresses) and she can\u2019t wear it anywhere else. \n\nAt this point, I want the wedding to be over with so I can be on my honeymoon and not have to deal with these people. \n\nSo, was my action too extreme? AITA?", "created_utc": 1698355530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h74bo/aita_for_kicking_my_maid_of_honor_out_of_my/", "score": 3192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She also obviously knew it was wrong because she told you out of guilt.\n\nETA: Stealing $25,000 is insane. Put her on blast to everyone and file a police report. She also only told you because she was pressured. Cut contact and let the law handle it at this point.", "OMG! NTA. She stole from your fianc\u00e9 and lied to you and on top of all that she's crying because she can't wear the dress YOU PAID FOR anywhere else? Poor little felon. Depending on how much he gave her, she probably committed a felony as in some states the threshold is $1,000.\n\nHer mother should be calling to apologize to you for raising a selfish liar as well as criminal.\n\nUltimately it's up to you on who you want in your wedding. Longterm best friends often get a pass that other friends don't, but bottom line your friend is crying and playing the victim because she got caught.\n\nI am so sorry for this!", "She stole your fiance\u2019s money. Don\u2019t people realize this?", "NTA\n\nMake sure your family understands that this 'beloved sister' has become a conniving thief.   You can't trust her as she's already proven to be a betrayer of trust.   \n\nI'm sorry you lost a dear friend over this.    \n\nYou *could* choose to forgive her.

Tell her she is still invited and you hope she comes that way when you call the police you can tell them exactly where she is.\n\nThen stop responding. \n\nCongrats on your upcoming nuptials  My condolences you have such shitty people in your life that they think its ok for her to steal from your fianc\u00e9 to pay money she should have never spent in the first place. \n\nlastly make sure you put an armed guard on your gift table and your money basket because apparently its ok for people to take things that don't belong to them simply because it will financially benefit them.", "NTA, since she committed a felony the nicest thing you\u2019ve done for her is just removing her from the wedding.

I hope you have a wonderful wedding day, and a great honeymoon!!", "NTA. Have to say it took a turn there and I started out leaning the other way thinking it was going to be about how the bachelorette party turned out!\n\nYour decision is big but it is yours to make, and it seems like you have really thought it out and its about how you and J are going to feel on your wedding, which takes priority. Really, your wedding day is kind of the only day of your life that's really all about you and your partner.  I'm sure it would affect him at the wedding too (and what a sweet gift he attempted to give).\n\nTell your family and bridal party that this has already put a cloud over your wedding, let alone broken a very important relationship to you, and request them to respect your (very understandable) feelings about this, your decision about your wedding, and move on.  And remember M is the one who caused this.  Not you.\n\nFinally who cares about the dress she didn't pay for? That's all she can say for herself?", "NTA. She literally stole from your fiance.

She\u2019s a fucked up human being and you should cut contact.", "NTA her parents can pay you back the money she stole if they want this all over with. Otherwise she needs to set up a payment plan or get a small claims going.\n\nNever gonna trust her again so yeah the friendship won't survive.", "NTA, Absolutely not.  The best reason you listed was, \u201cM was able to financially benefit\u201d.  She literally committed fraud, or at the very least she stole from your fianc\u00e9.  I sure hope you don\u2019t continue the friendship or resume it.  Forgive her, yes. Trust her ever again, no.  Best wishes!", "I'm really shocked this is a mixed reaction from people you know. Like it's ok to steal a large amount of money from your friends because she benefits??? Uhh no. Wtf NTA.", "NTA- Things she stole: money, the gift your fiance wanted to give you, the experience he would have had seeing how much you enjoyed the gift he wanted to give you, your one chance at that experience, your trust. What else should you risk her taking from you?", "Wow. \n\nShe stole that money and has the audacity to cry about being kicked out of the wedding?! \n\nDo the others know how much money she decided to pocket? \n\nI'm actually shocked that anyone is on her side. \n\nNTA", "M: \u201cBut I was able to pay off my credit card bills!\u201d \n\nUm yeah, that\u2019s usually possible when you steal a whole bunch of someone else\u2019s money.

This decision is final and I'm not interested in any further debate on this\"\n\nI think it would be a bad start to your marriage if you let this girl continue to be the maid of honour. Your fiance generously offered financial support so that she wouldn't have to be financially burdened by a role she willingly took on, and she might as well have spat in his face. I don't know how else she thought this would play out.", "OMG NTA! my jaw literally DROPPED when you detailed her explanation- what a shitty shitty friend. \n\nAnd major side eye to anyone who is telling you that you overreacted- to me that means they have some sympathy or resonance with her actions. I wouldn't put my trust into any of those people either.", "NTA, except maybe a little to yourself.\n\nYour maid of honour steals a substantial sum from your fiance, and by doing so steals a once in a lifetime experience from you.

Rather than clarifying the amount she stole, how it has affected your wedding, and advocating for yourself, you just accept it.\n\nPeople you are close to know she stole from you and, instead of recognising the impact on you, advocate for her because she is upset. You accept this.\n\nYour own mother encourages you to ignore the situation because she cares for M, prioritising her over you. You accept this.\n\nWhat's stopping you from being more compassionate to yourself OP? Why are you allowing people to treat you this way instead of addressing it? Why do your friends and family get away with treating you with total disregard?", "NTA; she stole from you. She is a thief.", "NTA\n\nShe's lucky to have only been kicked out of the wedding. She should be sued! And in jail, but I feel like the police wouldn't have solid evidence of a crime at first and may need the evidence gathered for the civil court to try her as a criminal.", "NTA\n\nWhat she did was theft. She wasn\u2019t supposed to benefit personally from that money, it was not hers. It was given to her for a specific purpose, which it was not used for. \n\nIf all you did was remove her as your MOH, she\u2019s lucky.

Usually, con people will give you something that at least resembles the original deal so they can have plausible deniability, she basically gave you nothing and called it a day while pocketing what a lot of people consider a year's salary, that was supposed to be for 8 people to have a week-long vacation.", "NTA.\nOMG, I can barely believe this.

Yes, you had an okay time and made some memories, but it's not like she was hurting for the money because she was given it and she decided to use it for other purposes.

Everyone needs to step back and get their heads right. Your fiance is the victim here, not M. She is responsiblefor her actions and their repercussions, you are not over reacting, and your wedding is not something she is entitled to attend or participate in. She can look at the dress as another \"financial benefit\" she got from the end of your friendship. No one else has to agree, they just have to respect it. Tell everyone you don't want to hear about it again and to move on, so you can try and enjoy your wedding instead of it being all about M's betrayal of you and your fiance and the disappointment you feel, knowing that she wasn't who you thought she was.", "NTA. \nShe stole from your family. \nAll trust is gone.", "Nta.

If her response to all this was you can't kick her out because she has a dress and no where to wear it then I think your friendship is not viewed the same by her as it is by you.

You don\u2019t allow anyone in your life to steal from the man that you love. \n\n10. From now on that woman is known as the grifter and liar that she is.

That's not fair OR right to do to him.\n\n\n\nAnd he *gave* you an amazing Bachelorette party. A fantastic gift!!!! How do you think it makes him feel that you're not only never going to get to experience it, but that the money is *gone.* That feeling of being made whole after being taken from is forever lost to him.\n\n\n\nThis will taint your marriage. You need to seek legal counsel.\n\n\n\nShe went against the terms of a verbal contract. Sue her for breach of contract in the amount of 25k, plus legal fees, and be done with it.", "OMG that makes it even worse!  She stole from all the bridesmaids + your fianc\u00e9!!", ">The rest of the bridal party is split, with half saying I shouldn\u2019t have kicked her out \n\nIf you do end up texting your bridal party about the amount that was stolen, I would make a point to mention how this affected them too (monetarily). They essentially paid for an event that should have been 100% covered. \n\nNot to mention the fact that they aren't outraged at this on your behalf should speak to the kind of friends you have, sadly. If I were you, take note of who puts up a fuss/gets defensive/downplays it and maybe rethink their friendship.", "Enjoy your thief-free wedding, OP, and your honeymoon. Your fiance sounds amazing. When you two come back, hand all the evidence to a lawyer (no need for you to do this yourself, although you should provide a statement on the nature of the \"party\" and the additional costs incurred by your other friends that ought to have been covered) and have him write a demand letter to M, the boyfriend and the mom: come up with immediate repayment to J and the bridal party, or a reasonable plan, failing which criminal charges will be filed for theft/embezzlement (her) and possession of stolen property (them).", "So wait, she not only paid off her debt but her mom and bf did also?  Or did they also send you texts stating that is what she used the $$$ for?", "OP, I totally get it. You already have so much going on that the mental space it requires to deal with this, is too much. This is a beautiful time in your life and you've probably been the happiest you've ever been, up until that ill-fated coffee date where M turned your joy on its head. Nobody can blame you for wanting to rewind and reset to the moment before that when none of this drama existed. \nI truly hope you get to do that so that the memories of this time will always be positive to you. \nHowever, you do need to think ahead a bit, to also protect your own sanity. M's debt is STILL paid off. By you (yes it's your fianc\u00e9's money but it was intended for you... you gave up the intended benefit so you are essentially also paying). She is STILL BENEFITING from this. One day you're gonna run into her and see a new pair of shoes or a new car and you are going to feel that you paid for that. You are also going to resent her for the rest of your life for spoiling your wedding time. \nPlease don't do this to yourself. Go and enjoy your honeymoon but be sure to let all these critics know that there will be consequences once you are back and have the mental capacity to deal with this. And then follow through. \nYou will not only feel vindicated but you would have stood up for your husband. Hopefully the time you give them from now to when the consequences follow, will see her try to rectify this (and again it would be totally up to you to accept or not).\nRegret is not something you feel immediately. It will come later. And I am pretty sure you will regret it if you do not act on this firmly. \nNow go and enjoy your thief-free wedding,  have a blast on the honeymoon,  and update us on the festivities (and hopefully some M-tea) once you're back!", "This legit made my jaw drop. Your friend probably could've thrown you a great bachelorette AND pocketed like $10k without too much question and she threw you a slumber party at her house", "That's go to jail, do not pass go, do not collect $200 kind of money.  \n\n\nHOLY SHIT!", "That is more than a lot of people make in a year. And she just thought no one would notice?", "Oh please do this and report back lol. I wouldn't speak to her again. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding. Have fund and enjoy your honeymoon with that wonderful husband to be!", "The only thing I know for sure is that over 10k from a business is grand larceny. \n\nI only know that because my old GM wanted me to still hire a lady as an account manager that had that on her record... as a previous account manager elsewhere.

Another commenter pointed out it was 25k?! Take her to court OP! Hell no. Feel no remorse. Take out the cost of the weekend she did but get the rest back!", "Agreed. Maybe she has a friend that it can be tailored to fit", "That would still be conversion, a criminal offense.", "$25k?!!! What?! WTAF?!! I audibly gasped when I read that. NTA, at all. If it was $50, it would still be disgusting to steal from a friend\u2019s partner. But $25k?!! She is a criminal and anyone supporting her is either not getting the full story or is enabling this person\u2019s awful behavior.", "[ Removed by Reddit ]", "In another comment, she says her fiance gave her $25k for the party.

OP would absolutely be TA if she just let this go. He presumably worked hard for that money, and she\u2019s basically saying that her friendship with M is more valuable than him. I can\u2019t believe how blas\u00e9 she is treating this. Her \u201cfriend\u201d has literally committed a felony, there\u2019s no excuse for that.", "And she got away with it, so she\u2019ll do it again", "They just sent texts confirming that\u2019s what she used it for! As far as I know she\u2019s the only one who used it.", "That\u2019s the thing, OP. Your fianc\u00e9 is being gracious (again) by saying it\u2019s up to you, but you should defend him. She stole from HIM.", "100% on the 25k for the bachelorette  \n\n\nThank you for pointing out the one good thing about all this shit.\n\nDude rocks.", "Yes, publicise the information. Your social circle probably thinks that she just took a couple hundred or thousand dollars.", "It\u2019s only $500 in Virginia, which is actually an improve over the $200 it was a few years ago.\n\nEdit - It\u2019s actually $1,000.

So tell everyone who \u2018begs\u2019 on her behalf to go kick rocks or pay you the $25k she STOLE.\n\nHowever, when you come back from your honeymoon you really do need to press charges for theft. You have the evidence so it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to prove. \n\nI was friends with my MOHzilla for over 30yrs and it hurts not to have her in my life but she isn\u2019t the person I thought she was and sadly neither is yours xxx", "Congrats on the upcoming wedding hope you have the best day ever. Don\u2019t allow your MOH to come to your wedding, she stole from you, had no regard for your happiness, completely violated your trust. That is not a friend. Please update on how everything goes.", "It varies by state", "In the US, the number varies from state to state.  It's also more complicated than just a #.  \n\n\nTechnically, what OP says happened is not theft.  It's possibly embezzlement (which you could say is a form of theft) or more likely something like \"misappropriation of funds.\"  Whether it would be charged as a felony or not would depend on a lot of circumstances.  \n\n\nDoesn't matter, story is fabricated I think.", "These have got to be trust fund babies to have this attitude.
