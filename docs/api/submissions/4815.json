After about a month of dating and without any reason to do so, he ran a full background check on me, including a credit check, without my knowledge or permission.  It came back clean and my girlfriend told me about it immediately after the fact.  I noticed the 5-point hit to my credit rating, but that wasn't a big deal. \n\nI was more peeved that someone ran a criminal and financial check on me without my knowledge or consent, but I decided to let it go to keep the peace. We broke up 3 months later and had little contact after the break-up.  \n\nApproximately 2 months after we broke up, my now ex-girlfriend reached out to me.  It turns out her father ran the background and credit checks through his work. He hired employees, so he had access to his company's system to run the checks.  He digitally clicked that I had granted consent to the checks, but of course I had not done so and he had no back-up. His company's internal audit department was giving him a hard time to provide the back-up. \n\nShe asked me to complete, retroactively date, sign and e-mail a form consenting to the checks to her.  I was still a little peeved about the checks, so I declined to do so.  She went nuts and her father even called trying to explain his position. He was much nicer about it than her, but I still declined.\n\nUltimately, the internal auditor for my ex's father's company called to follow up and determine what happened and I told the auditor the entire true story.  My ex's father lost his job. He was close to retirement, but I know it set him and his wife back a bit.  She occasionally lashed out via text for a month after calling me an AH.\n\nIt was a relatively minor inconvenience to my life, and it did cost him a lot.

This is 100% a consequence of his own actions.", "NTA. What can be destroyed by the truth, should be.", "NTA - he used company time, employees, systems, access codes, etc. to do an illegal background check on you without your consent. He forged a document and then tried to coerce you into singing a falsified document. If he was so worried about losing his job he should never be doing anything illegal in the first place.\n\nHe did this to himself and honestly he shouldn't be working anywhere whre he has that much clearance to do such things.", "NTA that is against company rules if not illegal.", " NTA\n\n He fucked around  and found out \n He thought he wouldn't be caught... thats on him", "NTA.\n\nHe got what he deserved.

You didn't do anything to get this dude fired.

You\u2019re a totally passive player here \u2014 you didn\u2019t provide falsified documents and you only told the truth when asked. But even if you had actively turned him in, he\u2019s still the asshole for abusing his position.", "NTA.

In fact, we take yearly training on things like \"Protect people's PII\". (Personal identifying information)\n\nThere's no way the dad didn't know. He got himself fired for looking up someone's PII without their consent. There was even a checkbox he had to check that said he was doing it with consent! He did it to himself. Why he thought it was worth risking his retirement over, well, now he'll have plenty of time to think about that. \n\nFor crying out loud, criminal records are public. If he was concerned about that, he could have paid $20 to look those up online, on his personal machine, and not gotten in any trouble at all.

Running those checks without permission was his choice, and it's not on you to clean up after him.", "NTA - HUGE abuse of power on the dad's part.  It's like if my brother (a police officer) ran a criminal check on a person I was dating.  Completely unethical and inappropriate.\n\nAnd a hard credit check??  What if you had been in the process of buying a house?  That could have impacted your purchase or mortgage approval.\n\nI have a feeling that you weren't the first person he's done this to.

I DON'T know but I'm guessing him fraudulently checking up on you caused the hit to your credit. That he's doing this is NUTS. He and your ex are huge AHs for trying to gaslight you into thinking him reaping just consequences to running a fraudulent background check on you is anyway your fault or responsibility. Keep record of the your Ex contacting you, incase in turns into harassment.", "NTA. This is exactly what should have happened to him. He lied to his employer, used their resources for his own personal goal.. I mean. I assume claiming you agreed is some kind of fraud or something, I don't know but that all sounds illegal. Hell you could sue I bet.", "NTA. He made his own bed; he can lie in it.", "NTA. He better be glad no one is pursuing charges or a lawsuit and all he lost was his job.", "NTA - not your fault at all.", "NTA. You would have lied on an official document. Just blocked the numbers. At least he has hopefully learn his lesson and won't do that again.", "NTA. I worked in a loan department many moons ago (20ish years). I was in charge of running credit reports on individuals and businesses.  I had to do regulatory training and sign all kinds of paperwork that I would never run it on a business/someone without consent and never for anyone I knew personally (even with consent). They were very, very clear on the expectations. I would assume that the rules are even more strict now as the Internet was still not as common then. I cannot believe a grown man would do this and not expect harsh consequences. I was barely out of my teens when I was doing it and knew better. I\u2019m glad you refused to commit fraud for him.

So", "NTA at all, all you did was tell the truth.  Opening CCs is part of my job.  I would never do something like this no matter how bad I wanted to know.  If I did do it I\u2019d expect to lose my job.\n\nETA- You also have no idea how many times he did it prior without getting caught and he likely would\u2019ve done it again.", "NTA. We are responsible for our own decisions. There would be no consequences to suffer had he not committed a deliberately dishonest act on company time with company resources. Don't be an enabler. You absolutely did the right thing. Let his story serve as an example to others.", "NTA. What he did was illegal and unethical. He's probably done it several times and it finally caught up with him", "Nta, he abused his place of employment to do something he should not have, besides the credit hit, he got fired for doingsomething agaisnt company policies, let that be a learning oportunity .\n\nAs they say, one is never too ild to lean new things", "\"Hi, ex-bf, so remember when my dad abused company resources and forged your consent to run a background check on you? Haha, yeah, good times! Anyway, can you sign something that says you consented to the background check? It's no big deal, just a little... What? But he'll get fired! You asshole!\"\n\nReally.

He wouldn\u2019t ask you to do this if he weren\u2019t wrong.", "NTA\n\nWhile anyone can pay to run a background check, a credit check is much different and what he did was illegal.

However, being something of an opportunist I probably would have let it be known I really hate doing paper work but that I'm much more likely to acquiesce to filling out paper work when I have an extra $10k or so lying around. But, at the moment, I'm not feeling particularly inspired, but if some inspiration happens to come my way, then perhaps I'd consider it.", "NTA. He was foolish enough to do that through work. What was his plan? Assume you'd still be together and ask you to do something illegal for him? Which he'd also use against you probably. I hope this is real because it's very funny.", "Isn't that a felony? NTA", "NTA. Where I work this is a firing offense. This is known. We have meetings concerning this yet people still look up friends family plus those they're dating. He knew the rules. He chose to violate them. You did nothing to get him fired. He should be fired. No pity here.", "NTA. If the company thought this was a big enough grievance to fire him over it then it speaks to the level of trust he is supposed to have in his job. You didn\u2019t break the rules and asking you to lie about it after the fact isn\u2019t cool. If he\u2019d owned up to it from the beginning he might have kept his job. Chances are when the company found out he lied the first time when he ran the check and then AGAIN when they investigated it destroyed their belief if his trustworthiness and ethical decision making and he was fired from a position that required both.

Her father was a creep. NTA, again.", "A credit check is quite serious. NTA.

People like this need to learn their limits.", "NTA, he deserved to lose his job for being completely unprofessional.", "NTA. Period. If he had paid for it through public records or whatever sure, thats a minor inconvenience. A little creepy. \n\nUsing his work, that's a major overstep amd asking you to fake a document is asking you to comit fraud.  Not that nice a guy.", "NTA if this actually happened.  However, if the ex's father ran your credit as a potential employee with his company, as implied, that's a soft  credit inquiry and wouldn't affect your credit score.", "IDK what kind of organization your ex's father worked for but I worked for the government.  We dealt with a lot of very sensitive taxpayer information.  There were a lot of civil service protections so it was very difficult to fire anybody.  BUT if you used any government system for personal reasons, you were walked off the premises immediately and your access was revoked.  Using your business systems for personal reasons is a huge breach of your employer's trust.  It is a very justified fireable offense. And then he further tried to deceive his employer by asking you to lie.  The organization is well rid of someone who could have been a huge liability to them.  NTA.", "NTA. He\u2019s a grown man knew the potential consequences and still took the chance. It\u2019s not your job to lie for him.", "I understand dad wanting to keep his daughter safe bc you never really know someone and he was trying to protect her but what he did was illegal so now he\u2019s facing the consequences", "NTA \n\nYou didn't cause this man to lose his job. What you did was refuse to lie for and protect someone who lied in order to violate your privacy.\n\nI'm sure he was concerned about the well-being of his daughter, but as others have said, he could have done that outside his work(still shitty, but doesn't endanger his job). He chose to break the rules. \n\nI have access to sensitive data in my job. Every year I have to sit through a set of trainings on why I should only ever access that data when required by my job, and how bad an idea it would be to access that information for personal reasons.\n\nI'm positive this man has had to sit through similar trainings. He knew what he was doing.", "NTA. He broke the rules, got caught, and was punished accordingly.\nHowever, it was probably a huge slice of humble pie for him to call and ask you to sign the consent form retroactively on his behalf. I personally would have felt like this was punishment enough, and would have signed the papers. I\u2019m a big believer in giving someone a second chance - but there\u2019s also nothing wrong with sitting back and letting karma do it\u2019s job.", "NTA. I was sitting here a bit scared wondering how the hell someone can run a credit check on a random person. Now I see.\n\nHe is so controlling/protective of his daughter, who is an ADULT woman, that he just completely abused his position of authority. He deserves to be fired for that. And he\u2019s a fools to have done so and thought he would be lucky enough to see a blind eye from the law. It\u2019s a lesson too late to learn, but I\u2019ll bet some money I can\u2019t afford to lose that this ain\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done it. Just the first time he\u2019s been caught.", "Holding someone accountable for illegal activity doesn\u2019t make you an AH. He cost himself his own job. NTA", "NTA. I suspect you were not the first one he did this to? Maybe that is why there were sort of investigating him if i understood correctly. Anyway he abused his work resources for something pretty stupid. Glad you broke up with her", "NTA, but you could have been a gentleman.", "Even the US police will be fired if they check criminal backgrounds with out justification.", "Well said", "I've had several jobs where I've had access to sensitive information, and every one of those companies made it abundantly clear that you do not mess around with that data (and that doing so is an instantly fireable offense).\n\nHell, at one job, looking up my own records would have had security walking me off the premises within the hour.", "Yup. He got himself fired. You are NTA", "To me the fact that the ex so casually asked OP to forge documents, even though his privacy was so grievously breached, and then freaked when he refused suggests that the whole family (father and daughter anyway) see this kind of illegality as their right. OP is well shot of them.", "I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t look yourself up though. I mean I guess it\u2019s misusing time and resources but you can consent to look yourself up", "Oh yeah this wasn't a one off. They've been building a case for a while.", "I used to be in law enforcement and had access to several systems like this. A Special Agent was fired for doing this exact thing. It's more common than people think. Based on my experience, I doubt her father only looked at his daughter's potential boyfriends. He had access to look up neighbors, friends, co-workers, etc...", "So WHY would he do a hard credit check when for his job all he'd be able to justify is a soft one?", "There's two kinds, one does and one doesn't. \"Hard\" checks are when you are actually applying for a loan or similar. They go on your report and knock it down a few points. \"Soft\" credit checks are for other purposes, and don't go on your report or impact your score. I *believe* a hard check is more detailed than a soft check.", "It honestly seems like the daughter asked her father to do it in the first place. He should not have put his job in jeopardy for that. He should have directed her to an appropriate company for what she wanted or chose an outside company if it was his idea.", "Opinions can be stupid. Like how yours is.", "You don\u2019t appear to know how auditors work. They were comparing paperwork for job applicants to the credit reports that were run. This is very standard procedure during an audit in most companies", "it's possible the power of being able to run credit checks went to his head and he didn't think of the consequences of doing a hard credit check because \"that's my daughter and I only want the best for her\"", "Can confirm.  Any time we see stuff like that as a plot point on tv, my dh tells me just what that guy would be in for if it were real.  He says you would have to be nuts to try it.", "Not in my experience."]}
