After about a month of dating and without any reason to do so, he ran a full background check on me, including a credit check, without my knowledge or permission.  It came back clean and my girlfriend told me about it immediately after the fact.  I noticed the 5-point hit to my credit rating, but that wasn't a big deal. \n\nI was more peeved that someone ran a criminal and financial check on me without my knowledge or consent, but I decided to let it go to keep the peace. We broke up 3 months later and had little contact after the break-up.  \n\nApproximately 2 months after we broke up, my now ex-girlfriend reached out to me.  It turns out her father ran the background and credit checks through his work. He hired employees, so he had access to his company's system to run the checks.  He digitally clicked that I had granted consent to the checks, but of course I had not done so and he had no back-up. His company's internal audit department was giving him a hard time to provide the back-up. \n\nShe asked me to complete, retroactively date, sign and e-mail a form consenting to the checks to her.  I was still a little peeved about the checks, so I declined to do so.  She went nuts and her father even called trying to explain his position. He was much nicer about it than her, but I still declined.\n\nUltimately, the internal auditor for my ex's father's company called to follow up and determine what happened and I told the auditor the entire true story.  My ex's father lost his job. He was close to retirement, but I know it set him and his wife back a bit.  She occasionally lashed out via text for a month after calling me an AH.\n\nIt was a relatively minor inconvenience to my life, and it did cost him a lot.

He abused his position and got himself fired.", "NTA. It's illegal to run a check like this without someone's consent. Someone that is that prepared to bend the rules for their own benefit has probably done it many times before. Maybe this is the first time he's faced serious consequences for doing so. But this is an entitled person who had no issues breaking the rules for him to get his way.", "NTA. Her father isn't a \"nice enough person\", he's out of his mind. He broke the law (probably repeatedly) & would keep abusing his access. This is such fundamental stuff that he can't claim ignorance. He essentially cyber stalked you.\n\n I'm amazed you didn't bail on that relationship instantly.", "NTA. Big case of f\\*ck around and find out.", "NTA.  Her father made his bed, now he has to lie in it.  I'm all for checking out people who I'm dating, I do it all the time.  But he CHOSE to do something illegal.  I imagine, had you agreed and signed the form, you could have gotten in trouble if you were caught.", "You didnt cause him to lose his job. He did.\n\nNTA", "NTA. There were many ways he could've done the right thing, and he intentionally chose the illegal thing.", "NTA He's the one responsible for the misconduct and then he has the gall to ask you to commit misconduct to cover him? \n\nNo way, fam. That's called *accountability* and I'm sure is a word a man like him likes to throw around.", "NTA - You did not purposefully go after him, even though what he did was illegal and unethical. This is 100% a consequence of his own actions.", "NTA. What can be destroyed by the truth, should be.", "NTA - he used company time, employees, systems, access codes, etc. to do an illegal background check on you without your consent. He forged a document and then tried to coerce you into singing a falsified document. If he was so worried about losing his job he should never be doing anything illegal in the first place.\n\nHe did this to himself and honestly he shouldn't be working anywhere whre he has that much clearance to do such things.", "NTA that is against company rules if not illegal.", " NTA\n\n He fucked around  and found out \n He thought he wouldn't be caught... thats on him", "NTA.\n\nHe got what he deserved. It\u2018s entirely his fault, not yours!\n\nPeople need to stop blaming others when they have to face the consequences of THEIR very own actions!", "NTA. You didn't do anything to get this dude fired. He did it all himself by abusing work resources in his position, I guarantee you weren't the first person he did it to and that's why it got flagged and followed up on. At what exactly did you do to get a fired? You told the truth and refused to help him cover everything up.\n\nYour ex and her dad are really asking a lot from you.", "NTA he messed up, got caught out and then sent his daughter to go and try and clean up his mess. People like him don\u2019t deserve positions where they have routes to access peoples information without their consent because clearly he can\u2019t be trusted", "Lol NTA. You\u2019re a totally passive player here \u2014 you didn\u2019t provide falsified documents and you only told the truth when asked. But even if you had actively turned him in, he\u2019s still the asshole for abusing his position.", "NTA.  You are clear-eyed to acknowledge that it's a minor matter for you, but there's a world of difference between not reporting your ex's father and submitting a backdated falsified consent form or actively lying to a direct question.", "I've been at my job for 19 years. Despite having been there for such a long time, I am 100% aware of what things are grounds for immediate dismissal and I *don't do those things*. In fact, we take yearly training on things like \"Protect people's PII\". (Personal identifying information)\n\nThere's no way the dad didn't know. He got himself fired for looking up someone's PII without their consent. There was even a checkbox he had to check that said he was doing it with consent! He did it to himself. Why he thought it was worth risking his retirement over, well, now he'll have plenty of time to think about that. \n\nFor crying out loud, criminal records are public. If he was concerned about that, he could have paid $20 to look those up online, on his personal machine, and not gotten in any trouble at all. Dad lost his job and his retirement because he couldn't spend $20 of his own money on something that wasn't his damn business anyway. \n\nOP is the victim, not the dad. Dad FAFO. NTA.", "NTA. He had zero business doing this. He got what he deserved. Running credit check on people makes me wonder who else He has abused his position to do this.", "NTA. They were asking you to commit fraud.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong here. He caused the loss of his job, not you. Running those checks without permission was his choice, and it's not on you to clean up after him.", "NTA - HUGE abuse of power on the dad's part.  It's like if my brother (a police officer) ran a criminal check on a person I was dating.  Completely unethical and inappropriate.\n\nAnd a hard credit check??  What if you had been in the process of buying a house?  That could have impacted your purchase or mortgage approval.\n\nI have a feeling that you weren't the first person he's done this to.  It sucks that he got fired, but it's nobody's fault but his own.  And for him and your ex to ask you to LIE about it just makes it even worse.", "If you felt really well-inclined towards this man, you might have perjured yourself for him. That you didn\u2019t, is fine. He should never have done it, and he knows that, he just only cares that he got caught.\n\nNTA", "There\u2019s a reason why that consent tick box is there. To stop people abusing the system (which he was doing). NTA. Maybe not what i would have done, but NTA", "NTA, who knows how many people he's done this to. I DON'T know but I'm guessing him fraudulently checking up on you caused the hit to your credit. That he's doing this is NUTS. He and your ex are huge AHs for trying to gaslight you into thinking him reaping just consequences to running a fraudulent background check on you is anyway your fault or responsibility. Keep record of the your Ex contacting you, incase in turns into harassment.", "NTA. This is exactly what should have happened to him. He lied to his employer, used their resources for his own personal goal.. I mean. I assume claiming you agreed is some kind of fraud or something, I don't know but that all sounds illegal. Hell you could sue I bet.", "NTA. He made his own bed; he can lie in it.", "NTA. He better be glad no one is pursuing charges or a lawsuit and all he lost was his job.", "NTA - not your fault at all.", "NTA. You would have lied on an official document. Just blocked the numbers. At least he has hopefully learn his lesson and won't do that again.", "NTA. I worked in a loan department many moons ago (20ish years). I was in charge or running credit reports on individuals and businesses.  I had to do regulatory training and sign all kinds of foo that I would never run it on a business/someone without consent and never for anyone I knew personally (even with consent). They were very, very clear on the expectations. I would assume that the rules are even more strict now as the Internet was still not as common then. I cannot believe a grown man would do this and not expect harsh consequences. I was barely out of my teens when I was doing it and knew better. I\u2019m glad you refused to commit fraud for him. Just think how many people he could illegally research if he wasn\u2019t stopped.", "NTA- the father fucked around and needs to accept the consequences for fucking around.", "Im pretty sure you could have have gone after bhim for damages in your credit and fraud... So", "NTA at all, all you did was tell the truth.  Opening CCs is part of my job.  I would never do something like this no matter how bad I wanted to know.  If I did do it I\u2019d expect to lose my job.\n\nETA- You also have no idea how many times he did it prior without getting caught and he likely would\u2019ve done it again.", "NTA. We are responsible for our own decisions. There would be no consequences to suffer had he not committed a deliberately dishonest act on company time with company resources. Don't be an enabler. You absolutely did the right thing. Let his story serve as an example to others.", "NTA. What he did was illegal and unethical. He's probably done it several times and it finally caught up with him", "Nta, he abused his place of employment to do something he should not have, besides the credit hit, he got fired for doingsomething agaisnt company policies, let that be a learning oportunity .\n\nAs they say, one is never too ild to lean new things", "\"Hi, ex-bf, so remember when my dad abused company resources and forged your consent to run a background check on you? Haha, yeah, good times! Anyway, can you sign something that says you consented to the background check? It's no big deal, just a little... What? But he'll get fired! You asshole!\"\n\nReally. NTA, OP. Daddy should just take the L and walk away, and hope that no one presses fraud charges.", "NTA. He wouldn\u2019t ask you to do this if he weren\u2019t wrong.", "NTA\n\nWhile anyone can pay to run a background check, a credit check is much different and what he did was illegal. He abused his power and faced the consequences. This was not your doing.", "NTA.  Though you may have missed an opportunity to ask for a cash \"settlement\" before signing anything.", "NTA- ex\u2019s father broke the rules and got caught. You didn\u2019t initiate the internal audit.", "NTA - He broke a law so he had consequences. It isn't your job to cover his butt when he makes mistakes.", "NTA- he literally fucked with your credit. However, being something of an opportunist I probably would have let it be known I really hate doing paper work but that I'm much more likely to acquiesce to filling out paper work when I have an extra $10k or so lying around. But, at the moment, I'm not feeling particularly inspired, but if some inspiration happens to come my way, then perhaps I'd consider it.", "NTA. He was foolish enough to do that through work. What was his plan? Assume you'd still be together and ask you to do something illegal for him? Which he'd also use against you probably. I hope this is real because it's very funny.", "Isn't that a felony? NTA", "NTA. Where I work this is a firing offense. This is known. We have meetings concerning this yet people still look up friends family plus those they're dating. He knew the rules. He chose to violate them. You did nothing to get him fired. He should be fired. No pity here.", "NTA. If the company thought this was a big enough grievance to fire him over it then it speaks to the level of trust he is supposed to have in his job. You didn\u2019t break the rules and asking you to lie about it after the fact isn\u2019t cool. If he\u2019d owned up to it from the beginning he might have kept his job. Chances are when the company found out he lied the first time when he ran the check and then AGAIN when they investigated it destroyed their belief if his trustworthiness and ethical decision making and he was fired from a position that required both. Make stupid decisions, live with the consequences. You\u2019re totally NTA.", "So, her father was asking you to commit fraud. That's what it comes down to. He was asking you to *commit a crime* because he ran a *background check on YOU* because you were dating his daughter who, it should be noted, had been a legal adult for *decades.*\n\nThis is one of the easiest NTAs I've ever handed out. Her father was a creep. NTA, again.", "A credit check is quite serious. NTA. I hate when I loose any points", "NTA you were perfectly with your rights to refuse but I personally would have done it to save the old mans job. Everyone makes mistakes and he was just trying to protect his daughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I come from a family that is very invasive and also likes to run BCs on people just because they are nosy (like, my cousin has a subscription to one of those services). Totally unacceptable behavior and invasion of privacy on his part.", "Eeeeek this is kind of a hard one for me. Quite rude to run checks on someone without their knowledge, but also a bit ridiculous to jeopardize his retirement seeing that it was a relatively minor inconvenience for you re: credit hit, writing a simple email. Ultimately, NTA. People taking advantage of systems/resources AND disrespecting consent is a HUGE no-no.", "ESH \u2026 I can see both sides. Not okay to do, but also sort of a crap move on your part.", "YTA...I disagree with everyone. Running a background check is smart, using company resources was wrong. But why would you go out of your way to harm someone who is just protecting their child. It's just distasteful and smacks of ugly revenge.", "Yeah, this is a huge breach of ethics and a massive liability issue for his company. OP may have been nice enough to just tell the internal auditor's the truth, but he would have been well within his rights to pursue legal action over this. He deserved to be fired for violating people's privacy just because he felt like it, the vast majority of people don't have access to these types of systems and they still have romantic relationships without needing to background check people. Overprotective is one thing but this is another matter entirely.", "Daddy decided to f*** about and got found out. Isn't op fault. \n\nHe's probably done something similar before if they were investigating him over it.", "NTA. For exactly this. But I have a question. Why the five point drop on your credit rating?", "This! Never ever abuse your power. I work in the judicial system and therefor I could check a lot of information on my friends and stuff. But I will never do that. Only check the information of the persons I need to for the job. And if I ever needed to check information of people I know I would let my coworkers handle those. That is just called integrity and that should be norm.", "I wonder how many people the dad did it to that had a hit to their credit because of it, AND it caused a lot of damage to their lives and they didn't know about it.", "I have doubts as to whether the documents they wanted signed would be enough to cover up the dad's misdeed.\n\nThe checks were hiring related. If the auditors were worth their salt, they would have wanted to see the full paper trail on the hiring process leading up to the checks. Which are one of the last things that would be done in the offer part process.\n\nTo satisfy that level of audit, dad would have had to forge a lot of stuff. And forge it fast. Cause a good auditor would have been suspicious of extended delays in getting the documentation.\n\nAnd... if a place is big enough to have auditors for this stuff, they're big enough to have multiple people involved in any hiring. Were they all going to lie for him?\n\nThere are bunches of ways this could have been proven for what it was.\n\nOP is NTA.", "Seriously, if he really wanted the criminal info that's simple and cheap enough. If OP had verbally agreed to the credit check that might change things, but the dad was just snooping. How he managed to get the info to even run the cc is disturbing in and of itself.

Fully NTA.", "Probably the first time an audit would have caught any others.", "Op states the ages were in 30's and 40's. Its beyond inappropriate to have this level of interest in your adult daughter's dating life.", "OP didn't jeopardize his retirement - the dad did when he negligently ran a background and credit check on someone (which unless I'm mistaken needs a SSN) without OPs permission.  Now he wants OP to continue malfeasance to cover his ass.", "Are you fucking serious? This is identity theft and fraud. He ran an actual hard pull that went on his credit report.
