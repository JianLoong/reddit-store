You were in pain, and acting out where you felt safest- at home. \n\nNTA. Sit down with your mom and calmly explain how this makes you feel. Tell her you don\u2019t appreciate her bringing up your behavior - especially because it was caused by pain and an undiagnosed medical condition.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t a \u201cdifficult\u201d kid, you had a legitimate medical problem that you weren\u2019t equipped to manage as a child. The fact that your parents continue to treat this as typical childhood antics tells me they are refusing to accept that you were legitimately struggling, and their job as parents is to figure out what their kids need, and at that point in your life they failed. Things may have been resolved eventually, but the fact remains that for years your parents assumed you were choosing to behave badly when in reality you were expressing your discomfort and pain the only way you knew how. If you don\u2019t want them telling these stories they need to respect that. They can\u2019t fix the past but they could at least attempt to respect the experience you had and treat you better now.", "NTA\n\nYou've expressed in the past that you feel embarrassed by their storytelling, and they persist. I think quietly removing yourself from the situation is a pretty appropriate and mild response. I would go as far as telling them I will be removing myself from the situation every time they cross that boundary, and following through.", "NTA you asked your parents to stop making the 'jokes'  and they did not, therefore not respecting your wishes or boundaries. Walking out was a polite thing to do as you could have yelled and sworn at them in comparison.", "Your parents basically told people how they neglected you early on in life.  Yikes.  I don\u2019t blame you for getting out of there.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you missed a huge opportunity.  You should have thrown a huge tantrum and pissed yourself right in the middle of the party.", "NTA. You were medically neglected, and your parents were at fault. Next time a story starts, say something about how they are joking about neglecting an ill child. That's hilarious, right, just a freaking laugh riot. Move out as soon as you can.", "Mine do it too. I hate it, so I don\u2019t think you are being an asshole. I feel very uncomfortable with this kind of situation also.", "NTA. You've expressed your discomfort with these memories before and your parents don't seem to have taken it seriously. It's understandable that you would want to remove yourself from a conversation that makes you uncomfortable. Your feelings are valid and deserve to be respected.", "NTA.  You need to ask your parents at a time when you are alone with them why you find the fact that their child had an undiagnosed medical condition that caused him pain and irritability is so funny to them.", "NTA. My mom used to do that to me all the time until I set a firm boundary. Stick to your guns.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not funny. You had medical issues which caused the behavior. It\u2019s not nice to make fun of you for things that were caused by pain as a child.", "NTA, you had a boundary, they violated it and you calmly walked away. No transgression on your part.", "NTA.  You just walked out, it's not like you flipped a table.", "NTA. I am neuro divergent and dealt with \"funny\" stories all the time. Perhaps some people find that humiliating their kids is funny and ok, I never did. \n\nOn a perhaps unrelated side note, all those jokes, manipulation and abuse ended up with me going no contact for 10 years before they passed. My only regret was that it was only 10 years.", "Next time they bring it up in public, turn the tables and say it was all because they neglected you medically for so long. They didn't try hard enough to help you and you suffered because of their horrible parenting. Maybe they'll shut up", "NTA. You didn't ruin the mood - they did.", "NTA - but your parents are, for shaming you and choosing to ignore a clear boundary. Extracting yourself from further abuse was a great move. Keep it up.", "ESH I had childhood problems too but now I am able to look back and joke light heartedly about them with my parents. We both suffered and it\u2019s never turned into a big deal when we talk about the past. Obviously each family is different and you were uncomfortable with the reminder. Your parents were wrong for bringing it up but you were wrong for walking out when you could\u2019ve just talked about the issue with your parents later.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Let\u2019s all hear some more about you guys being shitty parents!\u201d\n\nEvery single \u201cdifficult child\u201d story should get this type of response from you.  Every time. Make it as awkward & uncomfortable for them as they do for you.", "NTA. Your parents are being unkind, and I don't blame you for walking away.", "NTA. They are. They do this because they're pretending they weren't horrible parents who allowed their child to suffer because they were too stupid to get you diagnosed sooner.", "NTA and next time they bring it up, especially in front of a group, ask them what is so funny about medical neglect of a child?", "\u201cLOL remember that time we were terrible parents and medically neglected you!\u201d", "And when they bring these stories up in front of other people, make sure to loudly explain about the underlying problem they never considered.", "NTA. I know it's difficult to think up the succinct response in the heat of the moment, but OP might formulate one to have ready next time and say something true and specific, such as, \"You tell that story as if I were a brat, when the reality was I had a long term medical problem that you ignored for years.\"", "Amazing. \n\nThis is the most correct response.", "LMAO", "They should be grateful OP let them save face and didn't expose their lackluster parenting.", "NTA\n\nSay in a monotone \u201cYes, ha ha very funny same old story about a behavior caused by a medical condition that I had for several years in my childhood that has since been fixed.\u201d\n\nThe key here is a very monotone voice and repetition. It doesn\u2019t matter if the story is new to the listener or the listener is new to the story or how many times the story has been said.", "NTA if you walking out of the room ruined the party it was not much of a party to begin with", "They don\u2019t respect you. Share a story about the time they soiled themselves.", "NTA", "If they keep telling the stories, OP should absolutely start explaining how those stories came about because of the medical neglect his parents inflicted upon him. Maybe once *they* start feeling some embarrassment and discomfort, they'll gain a new understanding of how unpleasant such feelings are, and learn to do better. Sure, not embarrassing and discomfiting their own son should be a good enough reason for them to do better, but if self-interest is what it takes, at least they'll eventually manage to reach the right outcome.", "Literally was just gonna type it out. OP please do this.

They've ignored your requests.  You dealt with it in the most non-confrontational way possible, simply leaving the room.  Keep doing it.", "NTA. You asked your parents not to share such stories and they ignored your wishes. How about you tell everyone next time they relay a childhood story, that your parents didn\u2019t take you to a doctor or care for you properly by neglecting you as a child to rectify the fact you were in pain all the time and the only way you could express your discomfort was in said behaviour.", "I\u2019m curious as to how many of these commenters have raised children. Not have/had children, but actually RAISED them? \n\nWelp\u2026I have. Gave birth to two amazing sons and raised them as a single mother for the most part. I got all kinds of stories. I earned my right to be able to tell them, just like they earned the right to tell their own stories.

Tell them if they would rather you stick around, you will be sure to add to their story how they managed to let you suffer in pain from a medical condition for the first decade of your life and isn't that just rollicking fun to hear about?", "NTA \n\nNext time if you're feeling like crawling into the pit with them you can always clap back about \"how funny it was to go without a proper diagnosis because your parents would rather laugh at you than parent\"", "NTA, next time they do this since they\u2019ve ignored you being polite, is to start laughing and say \u2018yeah that was so funny how you guys refused to take me to the doctor and get a proper medical diagnosis as a child I just kept throwing a fit because I was in so much pain and discomfort ha ha ha\u2019\n\nPromise you that\u2019s the last time they\u2019ll pull that", "Fuck narcissist parents are the worst. There\u2019s a cute picture of me as a little 6 year old where I\u2019m semi turned away from the camera and I\u2019m cradling a mini mouse in my arms like a baby. I\u2019m sort of looking down at it and I\u2019m melancholy. I\u2019m freaking adorable with my ponytail. It\u2019s my moms \u201cfavourite\u201d picture of me because I was \u201cso upset\u201d that day. What happened that day? Oh we were at Disneyland and my recently deceased father was replaced by an abusive new boyfriend who was bullying me and saying \u201cwhat are you going to cry, I\u2019ll give you something to cry about\u201d and my mom snapped the photo. It\u2019s so cute, look how precious she is cuddling her dolly. Dude, if your parents get positive feelings from your trauma, get away and find people who protect you\n\nEdit Sorry I made it about me\u2026 NTA"]}
