You were in pain, and acting out where you felt safest- at home. \n\nNTA. Sit down with your mom and calmly explain how this makes you feel. Tell her you don\u2019t appreciate her bringing up your behavior - especially because it was caused by pain and an undiagnosed medical condition.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t a \u201cdifficult\u201d kid, you had a legitimate medical problem that you weren\u2019t equipped to manage as a child. The fact that your parents continue to treat this as typical childhood antics tells me they are refusing to accept that you were legitimately struggling, and their job as parents is to figure out what their kids need, and at that point in your life they failed. Things may have been resolved eventually, but the fact remains that for years your parents assumed you were choosing to behave badly when in reality you were expressing your discomfort and pain the only way you knew how. If you don\u2019t want them telling these stories they need to respect that. They can\u2019t fix the past but they could at least attempt to respect the experience you had and treat you better now.", "NTA\n\nYou've expressed in the past that you feel embarrassed by their storytelling, and they persist. I think quietly removing yourself from the situation is a pretty appropriate and mild response. I would go as far as telling them I will be removing myself from the situation every time they cross that boundary, and following through.", "NTA you asked your parents to stop making the 'jokes'  and they did not, therefore not respecting your wishes or boundaries. Walking out was a polite thing to do as you could have yelled and sworn at them in comparison.", "Your parents basically told people how they neglected you early on in life.  Yikes.  I don\u2019t blame you for getting out of there.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but you missed a huge opportunity.  You should have thrown a huge tantrum and pissed yourself right in the middle of the party.", "NTA. You were medically neglected, and your parents were at fault. Next time a story starts, say something about how they are joking about neglecting an ill child. That's hilarious, right, just a freaking laugh riot. Move out as soon as you can.", "Mine do it too. I hate it, so I don\u2019t think you are being an asshole. I feel very uncomfortable with this kind of situation also.", "NTA. You've expressed your discomfort with these memories before and your parents don't seem to have taken it seriously. It's understandable that you would want to remove yourself from a conversation that makes you uncomfortable. Your feelings are valid and deserve to be respected.", "NTA.  You need to ask your parents at a time when you are alone with them why you find the fact that their child had an undiagnosed medical condition that caused him pain and irritability is so funny to them.", "NTA. My mom used to do that to me all the time until I set a firm boundary. Stick to your guns.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not funny. You had medical issues which caused the behavior. It\u2019s not nice to make fun of you for things that were caused by pain as a child.", "NTA, you had a boundary, they violated it and you calmly walked away. No transgression on your part.", "NTA.  You just walked out, it's not like you flipped a table.", "NTA. I am neuro divergent and dealt with \"funny\" stories all the time. Perhaps some people find that humiliating their kids is funny and ok, I never did. \n\nOn a perhaps unrelated side note, all those jokes, manipulation and abuse ended up with me going no contact for 10 years before they passed. My only regret was that it was only 10 years.", "Next time they bring it up in public, turn the tables and say it was all because they neglected you medically for so long. They didn't try hard enough to help you and you suffered because of their horrible parenting. Maybe they'll shut up", "NTA. You didn't ruin the mood - they did.", "NTA - but your parents are, for shaming you and choosing to ignore a clear boundary. Extracting yourself from further abuse was a great move. Keep it up.", "ESH I had childhood problems too but now I am able to look back and joke light heartedly about them with my parents. We both suffered and it\u2019s never turned into a big deal when we talk about the past. Obviously each family is different and you were uncomfortable with the reminder. Your parents were wrong for bringing it up but you were wrong for walking out when you could\u2019ve just talked about the issue with your parents later.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know it's difficult to think up the succinct response in the heat of the moment, but OP might formulate one to have ready next time and say something true and specific, such as, \"You tell that story as if I were a brat, when the reality was I had a long term medical problem that you ignored for years.\"", "Amazing. \n\nThis is the most correct response.", "LMAO", "They should be grateful OP let them save face and didn't expose their lackluster parenting."]}
