He's your son. Put up half or shut up. YTA.", "YTA. You don't get to spend other people's money like that. Your SON is benefiting from the sitter. The sitter is there for YOUR son. Stop being cheap with it and splitting hairs.

Does the sitter spend an equal amount of time at both households?  If so then 50/50 split seems most fair.", "YTA and you created this conflict on your own.

It's not about you or your exwife. Would it be nice for you or your wife to give the sitter a bonus. Of course.

However son broke his body on time with mom so 50/50 good. Its your SON receiving the help, not mom. I'm sure mom would be happy to help him bath/dress and wouldn't need the sitter for these tasks if son would let her so it's not fair that she is punished for her gender.", "YTA Split the bonus 50/50. The sitter is helping your SON not your wife.", "YTA. He\u2019s helping your son. It doesn\u2019t matter where your son is when that happens.

He benefits your son, not your wife.  So it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s house the help occurs in. \n\nAnd the last time I checked, your son got 50% of his DNA from you.

I get if the kid is embarrassed to have mom bathe him again like when he was a baby but it is NOT weird or wrong for a mother to bath and dress her own child and she doesn\u2019t need a man to do it for her to make it less weird so she isn\u2019t benefiting at all differently than you are. It\u2019s your child that is benefiting by having an added layer of comfort to his injury. Remember YOUR child not just hers she may be the mom but that doesn\u2019t mean you are less responsible. This is just a very weird excuse to be cheap and make someone pay more money. I can\u2019t begin to express how weird reading what you wrote was. I hope your ex is happy and finds an amazing man.", "YTA and thus is f-ing stupid. It's the epitome of stupid, petty games exes play.\nPick your battles, buddy. Pony up the cash yourself instead of volunteering someone else's bank account if you want to hardline it. \n\nGoing Dutch is reasonable, cut the shit.", "Not an AH exactly but definitely petty and childish. Your sons belong to both of you and you both agree the sitter deserves a bonus so adult logic would say you each pay half.

Never said you did? That's not the issue here", "Does he suddenly stop being your son when he's with his mom? Does it *really* matter who he's with when he's benefitting?

Sure, she's not doing that actual labor but I bet she wishes she could. She's probably sad her son has grown up enough to not need/want her help with this. As a parent it's always sad when your kids evolve into a new stage that pushes you out. So, her \"benefit\" isn't the benefit you think it is.", "Your son is the one refusing his moms help though."]}
