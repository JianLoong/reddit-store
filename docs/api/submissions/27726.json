I'd turn it around and ask why SHE doesn't come and visit... except no I wouldn't because she might take that as an invitation or use it to blast you again, and for the sake of yourself and your kids, in your position?  I'd be muting her on social media and going even lower contact than you already are.", "You didn\u2019t butt in, but others did.  Not your problem, NTA.  I have a service dog, and I have listened to others talking about getting service dogs\u2026I bet you know what you are talking about.  Have a Service Dog is NOT for the faint of heart.

She sounds like a perfect candidate to go NC with.", "You're NTA for not visiting often, but Y T A for how you approached the service dog situation. It's not your place, you don't visit enough to know enough about their situation and needs to be giving unsolicited advice. The way you should have handled this was to say \"hey, hear you're getting a service dog, I've got quite a bit of experience with them as you know so if you need a hand with anything just let me know\n\nEdit: misread post, changed my judgement.

From your comments, you were right to be concerned about whether they are getting scammed. Her comments on Facebook is more a reflection of her than you. Anyone reading them is not blaming you for not visiting.", "ESH Let's be real, you kicked the hornet's nest, so can't really complain when you get stung.\n\nShe's obviously high drama and twists situations to make you look bad. But you *knew* this already, yet went ahead and questioned her parenting.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to cause more drama by blocking, just stay out of her business. \n\nHer post was likely just her twisting things, so don't beat yourself up about not visiting.", "NTA she sounds problematic. With your kids being autistic and her tendency to twist things, it\u2019s probably best to be careful about your interactions with her.", "NTA in any way.", "YTA for your comments about service dogs. You have your experience and that is great. But is is completely within the law for people to train their own service animals. Whatever training is required to perform the task for a disability is up to the owner to get. You have no idea what the dog is being trained to do, or how long that particular dog will take to master the task. They could actually call it a service dog in training and have protection by law as well. Let them do them. You get off your high horse and worry about yourself. If this is how you treat them I cannot understand why they would want you to visit at all.", "U not asshole. Sis need chill out. Travel expensive, kids autistic, and sis twists words. Block her if u want, nephew only reason still talkin to her.", "It takes give-and-take why should it always be you visiting her?", "Go NC.\n\nAs a fellow Service Dog Handler the whole community is so riddled with AHs and Judgement and a culture of \"Fake Spotting\" that no one is good enough for anyone else so you can't win even if you have good intentions you're likely bringing your bias into the situation. \n\nThere isn't a good way to comment on someone else's Service Animal BECAUSE the culture of tearing people down. Even if you were 100% in the right it becomes very easy to get defensive because EVERYONE has a nasty opinion that you're doing something wrong. You may have stepped on a landmine but frankly it sounds like she lives in a minefield.\n\nNTA", "NTA - You are not required to visit, especially if she is out of state.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s Facebook. Just block her, you\u2019re not gaining anything from having her as a contact and you won\u2019t lose anything by not seeing her foolishness. Out of sight, out of mind.", "My issue with the service dog is that in the go fundme page, she stated that the trainer would get the dog fully trained and ADA Certified in 10 weeks. Plus, this is a 25 week old German Shepherd from a friend's opps litter no testing of any kind. Those were my concerns, and I saw what my family members wrote. One was about there is no ADA certificate in the US, and the other wrote most service dog training takes years, not weeks.", "I don't know. My main concern in this situation is the dog. I think OP is right to ask questions if she thinks the dog might be miserable.", "I never questioned her parenting. I mentioned to family members that I thought what she posted on a go fundme was too good to be true. She wrote that the trainer was able to get the dog ADA Certified and fully trained in 10 weeks. This is a 25 week old Oops litter German Shepherd. 1 there is no ADA certificate in the US. 2 it can take up to two years to get a fully trained SD. What I worry about the dog it has not been health tested.  I also never said anything to her.", "Wow, you didn't read it at all. I never commented to her on anything. I said I had concerns to other family members. I was worried she was getting scammed by a trainer who said that they could get the dog trained and ADA Certified in 10 weeks. I know there is no ADA Certificate in the US, and it takes way longer than 10 weeks to train a SD. The dog is only 25 weeks old. Also, how did I treat them? I never spoke to them.", "R/legalcatadvice", "My concerns were she was being scammed by a trainer because her post said the trainer could have the dog, who is 25 weeks old, fully trained, and ADA Certified in 10 weeks.", "It's been a while since I've raised a seeing eye dog, but the earliest they sent them in for the actual service animal training was 1 year old. Before that, the training that I and other volunteers did was mostly for socializing the dog, teaching them regular commands, not to bark, etc. 25 weeks strikes me as very young to start a dog on that kind of training, especially since I'd be surprised if the basic obedience training was well-established at that time.\n\nPlus, not every dog has the temperament to be a service animal, and at 25 weeks you really can't know whether they're suited for the work.", "So, I'm going to hold my hands up at this point and say I misread your post when I commented, thinking that you had also messaged SIL which resulted in my judgement. I realise now that you didn't and just discussed it with your family so will go back and edit. \n\nThose are valid concerns but I don't think your family members should have messaged what they did, but you have no control over their actions. \n\nIf blocking and going NC isn't an option, I would consider unfollowing or hiding their posts so you don't have to deal with their drama", "That\u2019s not really your issue, though. Stay out of this service dog conversation. YWBTA if you inject yourself into that, for no reason other than to stir some shit, from across the country.", "To be fair, OP did stay out of it apart from having a conversation about what they had seen on a public Facebook post. It was the other people in their household that went and DM'd the SIL. Those two should have stayed out, but having a conversation between your own household over something you saw on a relatives page is pretty standard I'd say. OP should not engage at all for a peaceful life."]}
