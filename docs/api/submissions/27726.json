You have your experience and that is great. But is is completely within the law for people to train their own service animals. Whatever training is required to perform the task for a disability is up to the owner to get. You have no idea what the dog is being trained to do, or how long that particular dog will take to master the task. They could actually call it a service dog in training and have protection by law as well. Let them do them. You get off your high horse and worry about yourself.

Before that, the training that I and other volunteers did was mostly for socializing the dog, teaching them regular commands, not to bark, etc. 25 weeks strikes me as very young to start a dog on that kind of training, especially since I'd be surprised if the basic obedience training was well-established at that time.\n\nPlus, not every dog has the temperament to be a service animal, and at 25 weeks you really can't know whether they're suited for the work.", "So, I'm going to hold my hands up at this point and say I misread your post when I commented, thinking that you had also messaged SIL which resulted in my judgement.

I train my own SD. From time I have dog till 2 years are regular obedience training and desensitized to other animals and cars.

But most SD training and intensive training does not start until 2 years old when most of the puppy faze is gone. And it takes a year to 2 years of training. \n\n\nSo I can see your concern.
