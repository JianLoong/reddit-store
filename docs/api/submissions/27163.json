Sounds like this house was your main residence. It seems reasonable to me that you would've discussed what would happen to it after your move. That would've been the time to make the case that the apartment you also own could serve as her residence when she's in town. It does seem that you didn't care what she thought about selling the place. You should've involved her, even if you think it is \"your asset.\"", "YTA. It's definitely weird and a dick move to sell the house out from under her without even mentioning it or discussing it. I get that it was \"yours\" but you lived in it together, she was living in it at the time, so it's just really, really strange that you didn't even inform her that this was happening.", "YTA. This isn't a money thing, or even a house thing. It's a communication thing. She's lived in that house for years. She has memories, associations, and probably had plans for the future involving it. Just snatching that away from her is an AH move.", "YTA cool its your money but damn is she your partner or what? If you can't talk through life deicsions with your life partner and treat her like an equal why did you get married? I couldn't imagine doing something like that to my bf.  Not to mention she was living there and its a big deal to have your house sold out from under you, whether  you owned it or not. Ultimately this is not about the money but about your wife feeling like an accessory.", "Wtf is your marriage. It sounds more like a business deal than a relationship..", "YTA\n\nPlease post an update on whether she actually moves with you after this. Thanks!", "YTA. what\u2019s wrong with people\u2019s communication? Of course you have to talk about these kind of things.", "YTA. She\u2019s your wife not a roommate. Your wife shouldn\u2019t be finding out what\u2019s going on in your life after the fact. And this isn\u2019t something small like a tattoo, which most couples also discuss btw. It is a huge deal and will affect you both regardless of prenup or solo assets.", "YTA. Do you see your wife as your partner in life or just a business arrangement? Even if the house was yours like you said, it was the home you both lived in. Not communicating that you would be selling it to her comes across as you don\u2019t care about her enough to even tell her you were going to sell it. You need to share with your wife.", "OP is definitely hiding the reason why they didn't tell their wife. Nobody can be this obtuse.", "YTA.\n\nIt is your place to do what you want with. But, if you care about your wife you would have involved her in the decision.", "She\u2019s right.  You sold the house you\u2019re currently living in without saying a word until you were able to present it as a fait accompli.  Even when a thing belongs wholly to you, if selling it affects your partner - like, say, forcing them to move - part of being a *partner* is at least talking about it first.  That gives your partner the ability to have a conversation with you about their priorities and needs and how not having their current living space will work.  It gives them more time to make alternative arrangements if your ideas about how their needs will be met don\u2019t suit them.  The whole point of being married is that you\u2019re choosing to become a team, theoretically for the rest of your life.  So act like one! YTA", "YTA- Sir you may be great with finances, but you apparently fail at relationships. To your partner, that house is more than a simple dwelling, it was a place filled with shared memories. A Prenump has nothing to do with the martial emotional betrayel you just pulled. This is an emotional/relational mess you made, not a financial one.\n\nChances are you two will still stay married and everything, but I hope you take some onus and apologize to her for not consulting her about this decision. Bonus points if you can validate her conflicting feelings of anger, sadness, and grief with moving out of a home where likely so many amazing memories have been made without time for closure. Failure to do so could lead to building resentment that could impact your relationship long term.", "YTA\n\nIt is weird to not communicate that you\u2019d be selling the home. Yes, you own it. Are you not capable of disclosing major decisions to your wife, or would you rather blindside her? There is a disconnect that you don\u2019t see. You should\u2019ve told her.", "Yta it's a lot of extra work moves to a different aparment she should know before it happens.", "YTA\u2026seems like you\u2019d have to do a lot of lying and sneaking to pull this off. Why so shady?", "YTA. It may have been your asset, but it was also her home. You didn't need her permission, but it wasn't okay to not even tell her.", "YTA. If you had a dog before you got married, then both lived with the dog for years, then you had the dog put down while she was gone and don\u2019t tell her, then tried to say - it was my dog first she shouldn\u2019t care, you\u2019d be Captain of the Assholes. In this case, you\u2019re the lieutenant.", "YTA. \n\nWtf is wrong with you?", "YTA. It was home to both of you even if it was your property. Though you defend yourself using logic, this reeks of underlying malice or resentment. I would say you've got some big problems in this marriage. Your poor communication is the tip of the iceberg. You need to be honest with yourself about what motivated you to do this.", "It's common courtesy to discuss major things like this with your spouse, regardless of whose asset it is.  She lives there now, so it affects her, whether or not you realize that.  YTA", "YTA. Whether you own it or not, this is the house she lives in.\n\nAnyone with the tiniest shred of decency would have clued her in. You did it this way to assert control.", "YTA. A heads-up would've been the right thing to do.", "YTA\n\n\\-read your own post. It is clear that you are...", "YTA", "YTA. Common decency and respect dictates saying something to your wife prior to selling the house. Yes. Even if it was solely yours. What you did was a dick move.", "That seems like a pretty big decision to not at the very least inform her about your plans. Had it been the apartment, I would understand but the main residence? That makes Yta. \n\nShe lived there. She should have been informed.", "YTA. Yes, it was your property. Ultimately the decision is yours. But how do you not think this is something you should talk to your wife about. Even though your assets are separated you are still a team.", "Uh, people in transactional marriages.. it may have been solely yours but she lived there too. \n\nYTA", "Major YTA, how could you not tell your wife you sold the place you were living in?", "YTA so much that I'm not even sure this is real.\n\nYou guys talked so much about this move over **years,** but you drop selling the house you were both living in as a last minute piece of info?...\n\nDoesn't sound like you see her as much of a \"business\" (OP's language, not mine) **or** \"romantic/emotional\" partner. Not even sure why you'd be married. **This screams \"I know best and didn't want to worry your pretty little simple mind, so I took care of it\"** which is extremely condescending.", "Yta", "Big YTA. Do not be surprised if your wife leaves you. In some states, no matter who owned it first, the spouse has some interest in the primary residence in not getting forcibly displaced from it.  This is something someone does when they want to dump someone", "YTA and with communication skills like yours don't be surprised if that pre-nup swings into action sooner rather than later. \n\nWhy the heck wouldn't you mention it? You could have let her know what you were planning to do, but that you weren't expecting her to deal with any of the legalities or paperwork as she's busy with the other house. That way she would have had a heads up and be able to consider where she'll stay when she comes back to the area.", "YTA, please post an update when she divorces you", "You could have told her. I mean, why not??? Its just weird.", "It's not about the money, it's about respect your partner. Like your kidney is yours but if you want to donate or sell it at least talk to your family first.", "It\u2019s not the point of leaving her with the apartment or not. Nor does it matter if it\u2019s your asset or not. You did it and did not have a general conversation about it to be a dick and act like you can do as you wish with no consideration of her. I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t have cared about the sale but it\u2019s more about including her in the decision within the marriage.", "Whatever.  It\u2019s not a partnership marriage. It\u2019s the other kind. Now at least his wife knows.", "YTA \n\nHoly hell YTA. \n\nYou don\u2019t sell the home someone lives in, regardless of who they are, without at least informing them. \n\nYou sold her home, regardless of whose name is on it (and prenup or not, asset or not, a marital home that she\u2019s lived in for years is still her home too.) \n\nWho think it\u2019s okay to sell a house that you both live in without mentioning it first?", "It's like you're not even married. You're business partners who live together. YTA", "YTA. As she said, you haven't treated her as your wife. You're looking at it as just an asset however that asset also has a lot of memories in it. If you had made your mind to sell it as 'your asset' you could have given her the option to buy it. Sounds like you need a little more communication bud...", "YTA", "YTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn what world would you not even casually mention it before selling?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso how did you do any showings without her knowing?", "YTA-Communicate with your wife. You guys aren\u2019t divorced yet.", "I mean is it that hard to tell your wife so you could avoid this situation? OP is hiding something.", "YTA. It may be your asset but it\u2019s her home. You should have discussed it with her.", "Without even informing her? Absolutely YTA. You didn't have to ask or get permission, but you could have let her fucking know.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t really matter if the house is solely yours, she\u2019s still your spouse. Spouses need to be informed of these things.", "YTA. Had a school friend who's parents divorced because his step-dad bought a house without informing his wife, forcing her to sell her inherited childhood home they had lived in before then to get through the payments because they had merged all accounts at marriage. So yeah, who would've have thought making life changing decisions on your own, which also involves your partners life, without communication would leave to arguments and a possibly strained relationship. That apartment of yours don't matter in this case", "You keep saying \u2018solely MY asset\u2019 as if being legally in the clear absolves you from all other responsibilities. \n\nYou have a responsibility towards your wife to discuss major decisions. That\u2019s part of being in a relationship. I don\u2019t understand how you managed to sell your home behind her back without her knowing. Don\u2019t you talk? At all? \n\nYTA. There has to have been a conscious decision on your part to not tell her.", "I am so confused\u2026 how do you communicate in your marriage that you managed to sell a whole house without once mentioning it to your spouse? This is a process that takes time and effort so, even ignoring that you did not consider it necessary to inform the person that you share your life with about such an important step, how has it not even once been mentioned just casually during one of those \u201chow was your day\u201d talks? YTA \ud83d\ude44", "YTA.\n\nYou don't respect your wife. If you did, you would communicate major decisions with her.", "I\u2019d leave you, not gonna lie YTA, you are supposed to be partners but you are a dictator", "YTA\n\nI struggle to believe you can go through the whole process of preparing, showing, and selling a house without your wife knowing unless you were actively trying to hide it. You didn't mention at any moment a meeting with an estate agent? You didn't mention someone coming to view the property? You didn't mention the logistics of moving out all of your furniture into the new property? You waited until it was all completely done before you told her anything at all", "YTA. It's both of your's current residence. You seem to attach way too much weight to property ownership over and above consensus-baded decision-making in a marriage. (This is not to say that you don't have the ultimate say about the house. Just that you didn't even give her any chance to give input, possibly change your mind. Also, you made no effort to change hers and come around to your attitude.)", "YTA, it's not about who has what assets, or reducing stress, or even asking permission. You basically evicted your woman. You didn't even think of any sentimental value the home may have to her. The prenuptial was to protect assets in case of failure, right? It wasn't supposed to be a carte Blanche to live as if you have no responsibilities to anyone", "Yta", "YTA \nSo your money - your business. Maybe it would make sense for your wife to look for HER OWN apartment in the city. Of course, without informing you beforehand, because she would have been paid by HER money, so not your business. She wouldn't want to stress you with it...", "YTA -  So the house that has been HOME to you both was simply discardable without so much as a discussion?  No heads up?  No anything? \n\nIf your marriage is good, then there are likely \"many years\" of loving memories in that house ... and you just tossed them away without much of a thought.  Are you really that lacking in sentiment?  Because clearly your wife isn't.\n\nWhile it may be technically yours, it was HER HOME too.  And you totally discounted that.\n\nYour screen name is sadly ironic.", "YTA. Yes,  it was \"your house\" but it was her home. What you took from her was the benefit of her input. You can justify the reasons all that you want, \"we talked about it being too big\", but ultimately this was a decision that should have been reached mutually.\n\nYou seriously disrespected your partner.", "You were intentional about keeping it from her. You had plenty of opportunity to mention it but you chose not to. So yes YTA.", "Um, is this actually a question? Of course you should have discussed it with her and if you knew you definitely were planning on selling it the discussion would have been more of a letting her know in advance kind of thing which is only right as she's your wife. Good grief. You are married and live together. Why would it have been so hard to have a conversation?", "YTA, but only slightly. I consider a prenuptial agreement as something to document how you\u2019d split assets if you divorce. While you\u2019re married my understanding is it would be still be yours together. Anyway I don\u2019t think you meant to be an asshole but you should\u2019ve ran it by her at least.", "INFO did the real estate agent and/or the prospective buyers look around the property?", "NTA for selling the house but you are one for not talking to her about it. Your reason for selling are more than reasonable the upkeep of the house, you will no longer be there full time, it\u2019s too big for just two people and you have an apartment that you can stay at in the city. The only thing you didn\u2019t factor is the emotional connection that your wife has with the house and yes it isn\u2019t her property which I understand but you should of at least spoken to her and told her your plans before selling up.", "I'm gonna say NTA but you could have given your wife the courtesy of a heads up.  \n\nYou already bought a new place and you still had the apartment.  The house was your property and it was your right to do with as you wished.  Unless you were going to give her the option to buy it, the fact that it *was* her home doesn't entitle her to a veto in case she objected to you selling it.  \n\nMy husband purchased the house we live in before we got married.  We didn't sign any pre-nup and my name is not on the deed, but a platform has been set-up for me to inherit the home and his assets should anything happen to him God forbid.  I was visiting my grandfather (Parkinson's) for what will likely be the last time when this house went up for sale and he pulled the trigger while I was away.  After losing 4 separate opportunities (very aggressive housing market at the time), I don't blame him for not including me.  \n\nI also understand that if he decided to sell this place it's on him.  Your wife is not wrong to feel excluded on a big decision, but the decision was never hers to make.  I won't say that means it doesn't matter ultimately, but in the end, it doesn't matter: it was your asset to manage as you see fit.  Unless she was going to buy (or rent from you) her opinion on what you should do with your stuff is just that, an opinion.", "NTA, A testament that there is always varying degrees of wealth. \n\nBut, the wife is the boss.. you know that\u2026", "First world problems.\n\nAnyway if it was in the prenup it's mostly a decorum/general communication breech rather than a morally bad one. NTA", "Marriages with prenups aren\u2019t real partnerships anyway.", "NTA. You sold an asset you owned. It didn\u2019t impact your wife or her quality of life. If your marital understanding is that you manage your assets separately, you didn\u2019t need to consult her before acting in your best interests. I understand she would be disappointed that you didn\u2019t discuss it with her, but I don\u2019t think YTA because of that.", "Yes.

It never occurred to you that she might want to, I don't know, know about the process considering she's been living there years and years???", "My ex-wife contacted an agent and put our house on the market without telling me....\n\nOne of many life altering decisions she unilaterally made... which is part of the reason she is now my ex-wife.\n\nOP is an AH", "Bro, I didn\u2019t even sell our old kitchen table on FB Marketplace without talking to my partner. \n\nA whole house?!", "That sounds like entitlement. If they were a group that bought up homes and apartment complexes, I could see your point. But they're individuals. There isn't anything that says you are only allowed so much property in a lifetime. OP isn't the one making housing unaffordable. \n\nThis is why higher-ups never get called out. They have us snipe at each other, rather than pointing the blame where it actually belongs.", "I never expect one when I ask them that. Lol", "Is that true? I find that kind of odd if only one name is on title and especially as they even have a prenup stating it is a separate asset.\n\nThat means you can essentially \"block\" your spouse from selling a thing you have no ownership of? Because hypothetically OP could just divorce the wife then sell it anyway, if she said no. (Obviously an insane example, just saying why the rule doesn't really make sense)\n\nOr is it specifically because it's where they live that makes it different?\n\nIs it a formality?\n\nI'm a Canadian but I was in a similar spot. Bought a home prior to getting together with my now spouse, lived in it together, then sold it. She never had to sign a thing. I still involved her in the process but legally it was entirely my directive.\n\nThat said if this story is even true OP is still a dick.", "In Canada as well. When my husband sold the house he owned (but we lived in together), I had to sign a form at the notary essentially giving my blessing for the sale before the realtor would list it. Even though I had no claim to the house, he was not legally allowed to make me homeless without my consent.", "He didn't just \"not mention\" it either. Selling a house is a fairly involved task, he would have intentionally needed to conceal that from her.", "Not to mention, what is the likelihood she is going to have to do the hard yards of the incredibly tough logistics/planning job that moving houses is?! He might move some boxes if she asks him to, but sure as hell she will be the one running around orchestrating this life upheaval. \n\nMoving is one of the most stressful things you can do. OP does not treat his wife as an equal, at all. OP is a goddamn asshole.\n\n(Side note, it is incredible that money makes peoples lives so much easier but also has a vicious asshole perpetuation cycle that creates these ridiculous relational problems that boggles the minds of poor couples who have to actually work as a team)", "Unless she didn't think the intention was to make the beach house the primary residence. Which it doesn't sound like she did to me. The apartment is his rental property so that is somewhat irrelevant.", "This is exactly how my lawyer explained it to me. This is why we bought a home together and didn't live in either of our homes. This way, if it comes to divorce, no one feels like they got taken advantage of. I also just saw this happen with my parents.", "When I refinanced the house (we bought before we were married and it was solely in my name--and easier to keep it that way), my husband had to sign. The bank didn't tell me ahead of time because I guess they assumed I knew. But yeah, I don't think a married person could sell without their spouse signing off on it.", "Exact thoughts I had", "Sounds like \"I'd rather beg for forgiveness than ask for permission\" which is the worst Man Disease\u2122\ufe0f", "Substantial wealth, prenuptial agreement, beach house. Might as well give her a reason to leave so he can get a newer model.", "I don\u2019t think OP cared how she\u2019d feel", "Which also indicates a lack of respect.", "Not necessarily life long you see he avoided that.\n\nAnd those things aren't mutually exclusive.", "I was thinking the very same thing", "Right!", "Right? My husband and I keep our bank accounts separate. We are not welathy, but we have a reasonable \"rainy day fund\" equal to about one year of his income, all saved by ME, in my account. Even though I made this money, even though it's in my account, I don't tie any of it up in a CD without consulting with him first to make sure we're on the same page about future expenses and plans. For example, if I want to put $25k into a 14-month CD, I send him a message first (so that it's documented, and ask him if he thinks it's safe to tie the money up and if there's anything I should be aware of. It's just common courtesy and common sense when you're MARRIED.", "Although it's ideal to make the house as clean and streamlined as possible, it can be shown in absolutely any state. Totally up to the seller in the end.\n\nI've viewed plenty of for-sale houses still in their natural lived in state.", "I didn\u2019t even think of that. You\u2019re right", "Wouldn\u2019t there have been a for sale sign in the yard??", "It could have been a private sale with no showings at all.", "As if it\u2019s not a stressful process for OP\u2019s wife! He\u2019s definitely an AH.", "I was looking for this. This reads like fiction written by a 14-year-old, based on a 14-year-old\u2019s idea of what adult life and marriage are like. So many things don\u2019t add up. Here\u2019s one: he sold the home without telling his wife, and when she objected, he \u201cexplained to her\u201d why it was fine. See, in real life, after that she would be his ex.", "Or maybe HE wants to move to the beach, she doesn't. So, by selling the house without her knowledge, he forces her to move. Probably the apartment \"she can use\" is tiny, or usually rented (even if vacant at the moment).\n\nEDIT: OP, YTA.", "Not always. The owner has to give permission for a sign to be place. Realtors can't place a sign unless the owner of the home says they can."]}
