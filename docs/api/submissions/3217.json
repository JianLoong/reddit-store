It was also my (f16) birthday so besides thanksgiving we also had a whole birthday moment. \n\nMy family celebrates thanksgiving at my grandparents' house. One person being there is my Aunt (f30) and her daughter/ my cousin (f8). My aunt had 4 miscarriages before her daughter was born, so when my cousin was born my aunt made it a big deal which is fine. But it has led her to spoil her daughter so much and now acts like a brat because of it. If my cousin doesn\u2019t get her way she\u2019ll throw a fit. My cousin is also the last born of this generation of the family so my aunt has made it a point that her daughter is the princess of the family and she should get all this attention because she is special. My whole family just lets her think that way because they know how hard it was for her to have those miscarriages so her daughter is special to her. \n\nSo as I was saying yesterday was also a birthday celebration for me besides thanksgiving. While most extended family members give me money or gift cards for my birthday my grandparents always give me actual gifts so they were sitting out for me. My cousin started throwing a fit that nobody got a gift for her. So my Aunt asked if my cousin could help me open my gifts I agreed. Well, she got mad that it was nothing she liked and ended up throwing and breaking a new makeup plate I got. My aunt said she didn\u2019t mean to but did agree to buy me a replacement one. \n\nThen it was cake time and everyone started singing me happy birthday cousin yelled no and blew out the candles as we were trying to move the cake farther from her she completely smashed my cake. By then I was upset it\u2019s hard enough having a birthday on a holiday but now I\u2019m having it ruined by a bratty kid. My aunt started saying cousin didn\u2019t mean to and that she was still little. \n\nSo I said she should know better I get your daughter is special to you because of the miscarriages you had but she isn\u2019t a baby anymore, instead she is a brat. So stop using she\u2019s your special little rainbow baby as an excuse and learn to accept you\u2019re raising a spoiled brat. My aunt instantly started crying and went upstairs. A few family members (not my parents or grandparents) called me an AH and said I didn\u2019t have to be that rude about it, but and that I completely ruined the holiday.", "created_utc": 1669393647, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4hhwk/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_just_because_her/", "score": 6551, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let her trash your birthday party, blow out your candles, smash your cake and break your presents next time.", "NTA.  You didn't ruin the holiday.  Your 8 year old cousin did.\n\nAn 8 year old is more then old enough to behave appropriately in situations like that.  And if they are not, your Aunt should have left the room with them.", "NTA. \n\nYour Aunt is raising a monster.", "NTA if this isn't nipped in the bud now your aunt is going to have a very difficult life. Hope you were able to have a good birthday regardless of this.", "NTA- your cousin is 8. She's not a toddler and even if she were, the aunt needs to discipline her child.  \nI think your comment was a bit AH, but I'm guessing it has been years of this behavior and the excuse of why the child is allowed to behave this way. Your aunt doesn't seem to understand or care that they're doing a disservice to your cousin.", "Nta. I have an 8 year old. I\u2019m not one of those \u201cmy kid would never\u201d people usually but like\u2026..my kid would never. Your aunt is choosing to raise a horrible human.

I do agree with everyone that mentioning her miscarriages is kind of rude, but your aunt needs some tough love here. She's completely in the wrong and needs to raise her kid better. I could see a toddler acting like this maybe, but not an 8 year old. She's not a baby any more, she's 8.\n\nAs someone who can't have kids other than through IVF and also had my first/probably only after a miscarriage, I feel like your aunt is the worst. Seriously, I spoil my little rainbow baby, but she would never do this and she's 3. Even at her most tired and most angry toddler, she'd never do shit like this 8 year old, and we certainly wouldn't allow it or excuse it if it started happening.\n\nHopefully your aunt learned a lesson, so she can teach her child not be be a bratty jerk.", "NTA. Your aunt, her bratty child, and all the enabling adults in the room and in your family are AHs. Aunty and her brat were bound to get told off some day.

Your aunt can spoil her child as much as she wants but once this behavior starts affecting everyone else, it should\u2019ve been nipped in the bud a while ago. Your family is coddling her.", "NTA. If what you said is completely accurate (and I don\u2019t doubt it is) then someone needed to say it. It\u2019s her job to make sure the kid knows right from wrong. Destroying the cake should have been an obvious wrong to an 8 yr old, as was breaking your gift. You need to remind those chastising you just what you\u2019ve said here. That it\u2019s hard enough to share a birthday with a holiday, but to have the kid also acting out and ruining your gift and cake is just plain not okay. And before they call you an AH, you too are a kid and should not have to appease a bad mannered kid that has acted out routinely even on your own birthday. They were likely all thinking what you actually said and should back up the truth of what you said. The kid is young enough to course correct before it\u2019s too late. Good luck OP!", "NTA\n\nThe brat and her enabling mother completely ruined your birthday, not to mention Thanksgiving. I'm sure it was hard for your aunt to hear, but *somebody* had to tell her. \n\nI hope she listens and sets boundaries for her kid.", "NTA, but your aunt and cousin are.", "NTA.

She will have no real friends if she doesn't shape up.\n\nYou didn't ruin the holiday, your spoiled eight year old cousin did.", "Sometimes people in your aunt's situation they are so focused on having a baby and being a parent, that they are blind to the fact that the baby grows up and they need to parent not just be a parent. \n\nNTA \n\nHappy Birthday, I hope the people that care for you make it up to you.", "NTA.\n\nI have an 8 year old. Also a rainbow baby. But my god would he never behave like that!

Your cousin ruined both your birthday present and birthday cake. She is a spoiled brat and that is completely on her parents. While it may have been a little harsh to call her out like you did, she needs to know that she is raising a child that's behavior is unacceptable. My kids knew not to act like that by the time they were 3. To act like that as an 8 year old is ridiculous and should be called out.", "NTA\n\nA child can be raised to feel special *and* be raised to be respectful of others.

If she was in my house, she wouldnt get away with behaving like that for an instant.", "NTA! You're in the right on this. I'm sorry your aunt had all those miscarriages, but her daughter is only special in HER eyes. However, mentioning the miscarriages was rude and insensitive. That's something you should apologize for. Your aunt is setting up your cousin for a rude awakening when she gets older. They both owe you a huge apology for ruining your birthday and try and make it up to you.", "At 8, she should already be in 2nd grade....I wonder if she acts like that in school? She is certainly not a baby anymore. \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nYou did good calling out that behavior.", "NTA\n\nYour Aunt's spoiled brat ruined the holiday.   The only thing you're guilty of is saying the quiet part out loud.", "NTA. The truth hurts sometimes and frankly being blunt to the point of cruelty is occasionally necessary. How you phrased it was cruel. I doubt anything else would get through the haze of baby of the family that came after four miscarriages. \n\nIn the end your aunt does need to realize that she's raising a future adult that will need to know how to function with other people not the infant she brought home from the hospital. She's not doing your cousin any favors by letting her act like a brat.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt is raising an entitled person and that'll bite her and anyone who defends that kid in the ass later on.", "NTA. You were blunt but completely truthful. An eight year old child is well past the age of comprehending that they are not the center of the universe. If aunt doesn\u2019t quickly change her parenting style, there will be no hope for your cousin.", "NTA. Of course the kid doesn\u2019t know any better. None of the adults in her life are teaching her to act like a civilized member of society.", "NTA, what you said was harsh yes but your aunt needed to hear it. Because honestly you were probably a lot nicer than other people are going to be. Her friends\u2019 parents are not going to care she\u2019s a rainbow baby when she\u2019s ruining their house or their kid\u2019s birthday party. Her teachers are not going to care she\u2019s a rainbow baby when she\u2019s acting like a terror in class. Her roommates at college are not going to care she\u2019s a rainbow baby when she helps herself to their stuff but refuses to replace it. Strangers are not going to care she\u2019s a rainbow baby when she starts terrorizing them in public while having a tantrum. And trust me they\u2019ll be a lot less \u201ckind\u201d when they start laying into your aunt. The only person who thinks she\u2019s special for being a rainbow baby and deserves a free pass on her behavior is your aunt. 8 years old is too old to be throwing a fit about not getting presents on someone else\u2019s birthday and not getting to blow the candles out. Yes it\u2019s good your aunt said she\u2019d replace the palette her daughter broke but it should have never gotten to this point.\n\nMentioning your aunt\u2019s miscarriages wasn\u2019t your place but after eight years of dealing with this behavior I can understand just reaching your limit. And honestly IMO one of the adults in your family should have pointed this out years ago. It\u2019s not their place to discipline or parent your cousin but they\u2019re definitely enabling it by just sitting back and not saying anything. You just finally said what most of the family was thinking.\n\nOne of my parents neighbors had multiple miscarriages then their surrogate also had a miscarriage before they finally had their rainbow baby. And they spoil the hell out of him. That kid has never wanted for anything. But they would never dream of allowing him to behave the way your cousin is behaving. When he was maybe four he had a complete screaming fit at another neighbor\u2019s Christmas party. His parents were mortified and immediately scolded him and when he didn\u2019t stop they took him home. \n\nA girl I went to elementary school behaved the way your cousin did and she wasn\u2019t a rainbow baby. Just a spoiled brat. My friends and I\u2019d parents stopped inviting her anywhere eventually and her mom demanded an answer for why. Oh boy. Those parents were brutal in explaining exactly why she wasn\u2019t invited and none of the kids wanted her there. Her mom was shocked at the fact that someone finally point blank told her her daughter was an entitled spoiled brat that none of the other parents were willing to deal with. My BFF\u2019s mom summed it up perfectly \u201cyou are willing to put up with her behavior. We are not. Your daughter is special enough to warrant being allowed to act that way to you and you only.\u201d", "NTA. If the kid were three or something I\u2019d feel differently, but she\u2019s 8! Her behaviour should be reined in my now and your aunt should react when her daughter acts poorly. Someone had to call it out, might as well be you, and better now than when the kid is 18 and the damage can\u2019t be undone.", "NTA\n\n**BUT**\n\nYou could have been a lot more polite about it. \n\nThis should never have been something you had to say. An adult should have had the balls to step in here and reign your Aunt/Cousin in. Sounds like something like this needed to be said a long time ago--but way more politely. If this little gal is eight and is this kind of monster, she's only going to get worse and worse. You, however, are NTA. And adult people holding you(16f) responsible for stepping up for yourself when none of them did/have/would is just... Irresponsible? Cowardly? Shame on them all. I mean, you're more than old enough to know better, and if I was your parent, I'd be annoyed; but if I were your parent, it wouldn't have gone that far, because I don't let people treat my kids this way. I'm more polite about it, but... Some other adult should have stepped in here.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA. The fact that your niece is 8 and has had many opportunities to be gently corrected by her mother/your aunt is telling.  I probably wouldn\u2019t have raised the miscarriages with your aunt, but it\u2019s fair to point out that her daughter is acting like a brat to the point that it\u2019s unfairly impacting others.", "NTA op she not only ruined your birthday but your 16th! That's a huge birthday for most people in the us", "NTA. \n\n>Well, she got mad that it was nothing she liked and ended up throwing and breaking a new makeup plate I got. My aunt said she didn\u2019t mean to but did agree to buy me a replacement one.\n\nAnd...\n\n>My aunt started saying cousin didn\u2019t mean to and that she was still little.\n\nNo. No. No. Your cousin is not \"still little\". She's 8 years old. I could understand throwing and smashing things if your cousin was a toddler, but she's in grade school. She knows what she's doing and she's doing it because you aunt allows it. Make sure you hold her to her offer is replacing things her kid destroyed. \n\n>A few family members (not my parents or grandparents) called me an AH and said I didn\u2019t have to be that rude about it, but and that I completely ruined the holiday.\n\nYour aunt and her child's behavior ruined the holiday and your birthday.

I hope you feel a little better today.\n\nMy judgement is that you're NTA. Maybe this ends up being a good thing for your aunt, because it seems like nobody commented on her parenting before and she's raising a very disrespectful child that, if things continue the way they are, will become an awful adult.

Especially for you with cake and opening presents. Minus aunt and brat.", "NTA for being upset, but you didn't have to bring up the miscarriages to make your point", "NTA that child is 8. That's 3-4 year old behavior.  Your aunt is doing that child a major disservice by not appropriately addressing these behaviors. She's absolutely displayed lack of control around these situations.  If the child were somehow not nuerotypical, perhaps needed accommodations or services then her mother, her teachers and doctors would be addressing these issues. Your Aunt would have a plan in place to either mitigate these behaviors or help her daughter work through them. She's not doing that. More likely though this child seems to have never been given any consequences for their poor actions. Your aunt is 30 years old; old enough to also understand that actions have consequences.  Both her and her daughter should get into therapy asap.", "NTA\n\nSorry, but by my standards eight years old isn't \"little\" enough to get away with that level of bullshittery.\n\nI also don't personally believe that OP intentionally brought up the miscarriages as a tool to hurt her, I think that OP was pissed off. The miscarriages were/are a part of the whole mess with their cousin and their shitty behavior, I think it's reasonable to assume it was brought up because that was part of the conversation and they were pissed off. \n\nI know I can't be the only person who has said things I've regretted in a heated moment.", "Sure mentioning the miscarriages wasn't the nicest thing, but an 8 year old acting like a 2 year old would get on anybodys nerves. Not to mention you're technically a kid too. Sharing birthdays with a holiday already requires a bit of compromise and looking at the bright side. \n\nYour aunt crying instead of getting mad for me suggests that it might not be the first time she's heard her daughter is bratty. She might had heard it from teachers at school etc. If she's an only child, more likely to even add to being spoilt. \n\nYou are NTA for getting upset after having someone ruin a gift and your cake. I'm glad at least she offered to replace it. \n\nIf I were you, and you otherwise like your aunt I would apologize for the harsh words, but explain calmly that they come from a place of frustration. You want your cousin to succeed in life, and acting entitled and spoilt will not help her. You'd already compromised a few times and your aunt wasn't giving her enough limits. Limits are important. Your aunt probably knows too. \n\nHope you enjoy your birthday and have a replacement cake as well!", "NTA.  The child is EIGHT, not 3. Even my 2 year old understands it is not his birthday. \n\nMy 8 year old and 2 year old share a birthday, and sometimes it is on Thanksgiving. We too make a point to delineate birthday and bird-day.

That sucks and it absolutely sucks that her kid ruined your birthday.\n\nThat said, it was very possible to say all of this without purposefully bringing up your aunt\u2019s infertility/miscarriages. To throw something extremely personal and painful in her face instead of focusing on the issue at hand was purposefully hateful, and you know it.\n\nTL;DR, \u201cyou allow your kid to act like a brat, and she ruined my birthday because you continue to make excuses for her\u201d >>> \u201chey remember your painful fertility struggles that also feel like your fault?

Yes, your niece is a brat and no, it wasn't acceptable that she ruined your party. On the other hand, surely there was a different way that you could have responded. Honestly, if you just left out the whole miscarriage/rainbow baby part it would have been fine. \n\n*\"You're raising a brat. She's 8 years old. It's not cute.

Here is such an example. I wouldn't have brought up the miscarriages. You made yourself wrong. You should apologize for bringing that up.

Her behaviour was rude, entitled and embarrassing as well as ruining your birthday.", "I was completely on your side because this child sounds like a nightmare, until you brought up the miscarriages. You could have just said she's a spoiled and entitled brat- why would you bring in the losses your aunt experienced? You have an absolute right to criticize her parenting and her child's behavior. But you're not a therapist and she's not your client- it's not your job to make her deal with her pain and trauma. ESH", "So I think YTA. You were absolutely right to call out the bratty behaviour and that she should know better, but unless your aunt was making excuses regarding the miscarriages why did you need to bring them up??", "ESH. There was no need for you to bring up the miscarriages. You could have gone the whole rant away and then some, without mentioning the miscarriages. For your aunt, 4 miscarriages and a baby are not 4 false starts and then a success. It's 4 deaths she had to mourn. It's possibly 4 kids she never got to hold in her arms. That takes a toll. \n\nAs for your aunt and the enabling relatives, they are assholes too. They are ruining this child. What kind of adult is she going to turn into if everybody accepts to not discipline her because it was so hard for the mom to carry a pregnancy to term?", "ESH - OP shouldn\u2019t have brought up the miscarriages, that was mean. But, OP was in the right to be upset and the aunt definitely shouldn\u2019t have let her child ruin your birthday like that. \nI\u2019d say OP should apologize for bringing up the miscarriages, but ask that the aunt better control her child and understand that an 8 y/o is old enough to be controlled and told \u201cno, stop that\u201d and shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to ruin your birthday.

It was also my (f16) birthday so besides thanksgiving we also had a whole birthday moment. \n\nMy family celebrates thanksgiving at my grandparents' house. One person being there is my Aunt (f30) and her daughter/ my cousin (f8). My aunt had 4 miscarriages before her daughter was born, so when my cousin was born my aunt made it a big deal which is fine. But it has led her to spoil her daughter so much and now acts like a brat because of it. If my cousin doesn\u2019t get her way she\u2019ll throw a fit. My cousin is also the last born of this generation of the family so my aunt has made it a point that her daughter is the princess of the family and she should get all this attention because she is special. My whole family just lets her think that way because they know how hard it was for her to have those miscarriages so her daughter is special to her. \n\nSo as I was saying yesterday was also a birthday celebration for me besides thanksgiving. While most extended family members give me money or gift cards for my birthday my grandparents always give me actual gifts so they were sitting out for me. My cousin started throwing a fit that nobody got a gift for her. So my Aunt asked if my cousin could help me open my gifts I agreed. Well, she got mad that it was nothing she liked and ended up throwing and breaking a new makeup plate I got. My aunt said she didn\u2019t mean to but did agree to buy me a replacement one. \n\nThen it was cake time and everyone started singing me happy birthday cousin yelled no and blew out the candles as we were trying to move the cake farther from her she completely smashed my cake. By then I was upset it\u2019s hard enough having a birthday on a holiday but now I\u2019m having it ruined by a bratty kid. My aunt started saying cousin didn\u2019t mean to and that she was still little. \n\nSo I said she should know better I get your daughter is special to you because of the miscarriages you had but she isn\u2019t a baby anymore, instead she is a brat. So stop using she\u2019s your special little rainbow baby as an excuse and learn to accept you\u2019re raising a spoiled brat. My aunt instantly started crying and went upstairs.

When people are all wrapped up in their denial, it can take something shocking to even get them to consider another perspective on the matter. There could be as many reasons as you have family members for indulging your aunt and cousin. More important than whether anyone here thinks you are wrong is whether you want to be the person who continually tries (very often it doesn't work) to shock others out of their denial. The satisfaction of letting rip with your sharp observations might only be momentary. The damage of unkind words will remain. (I unfortunately have experience with both sides of this.) So you really need to consider if this is a relationship tactic you want to use often if at all.\n\nI wish I had a ready answer for you on how to proceed with your aunt and cousin.

They're expected to be everything the parent has always hoped and dreamed of but has been denied. So, acknowledging imperfection I guess to them would feel like they're sleighting their child.\n\nThe flip side of this is eventually the child notices that they can do no wrong but then there's expectation that they never will. So, when they eventually realize that they are a brat or have done something and they know they really fucked up this time, there's all sorts of pressure and panic there for them because they're supposed to be the Golden Child Rainbow Baby.

It's saddling up a child with the grief of miscarriages. And that this child now holds all the promise of the babies that died before. Even if you don't treat the child like the princess of the galaxy, you are probably saddling it with super high expectations which is also toxic. It's not that child's job to be the balm to the mother's wounds.", "OP said aunt calls her a rainbow baby. Therefore she\u2019s using the miscarriages as the reason.

There could be any number of reasons the kid is undisciplined, from her having mental conditions to the aunt also having trauma related to discipline. OP could not possibly know all the factors behind the scenes. OP only knows that a) her aunt has massive trauma that she has mentioned but that is not a reason to harp on it and b) the kid is a mess. Only one of those things needs called out.\n\nIt's like if someone was assaulted on a train a while ago and is rudely begging car rides today. Yes, both of those things could have happened and the rudely begging for car rides should be called out. But saying \"I don't care if you were assaulted on the train, you need to learn to drive!\" isn't going to help anything. For all you know, the person actually isn't driving because of a car accident. Then all you've done is be a dick about the traumatic experience and not actually called out the problem.", "... if you think that is gentle, I don't want to know what you'd call harsh.

My sister technically has 2 rainbow babies (several miscarriages before each kid) and sure, they are a bit spoiled, but they also are raised to be empathetic, kind, and work for what they want. They get almost everything they want, yes, but they also are given terms to earning those things that include doing their chores, putting effort into schoolwork (including asking for help if they are struggling), and behaving properly as well as apologizing and showing an effort to do better when they do not.

And two years before I was born she lost twins at 20 weeks (and there was at least one miscarriage before that). \n\nThe term rainbow baby didn\u2019t exist back then I don\u2019t think. But that\u2019s what I was. And sure there was extra fanfare when she made it to term and I was born healthy and screaming. But I was not forever treated like a miracle who might disappear if I was disciplined. \n\nMuch less when my brother came along (again needing fertility drugs and cervical cerclage)", "Being stubborn or opinionated are amazing traits! That will just be better when she grows up, God knows I needed that stubbornness to live my life the way I wanted/needed. So she's assertive and speaks her mind, sounds like a great kid.", "NTA yikes! If this kid acts this way around the family, I bet she\u2019s a nightmare at school. Wow.", "NTA, however you shouldn\u2019t of brought up the miscarriages. \nYou could of just called her a spoiled brat, because your aunt needed to hear that.", "NTA\n\nI think you showed some pretty amazing restraint for having your 16th birthday ruined by a uncontrollable brat.\n\nIf Mom doesn\u2019t get her little monster under control soon she\u2019s going to grow up very lonely. I would even bet now that the \u201cprincess\u201d tells her mother all the time that no one wants to play with her.", "NTA. The child is 8, not 2! Those (thankfully few) people who called you rude and said you \u201ccompletely ruined\u201d the holiday were scapegoating you big time. As for the rest of them? I\u2019d bet $ they were cheering inside. \n\nBTW, my little sister\u2019s bday is December 17, so I get the whole holiday/birthday conundrum. She said it was always a toss up; some years she got kind of cheated gift-wise, and other years she got things like an entire bedroom set. But I don\u2019t remember her ever having an actual birthday party. \n\nWhich brings me back to you. Sixteen is one of those milestone birthdays. I\u2019m sorry that Darla from *Finding Nemo* ruined yours.", "You are NTA and I am so sorry that your birthday is ruined. You done nothing wrong telling aunt the truth. Your aunt needs to teach her 8-year-old child that the world does not revolve around her. It is so weird that an eight-year-old thinks she should get gifts on the same day as the birthday girl. I wish I can give you a big gift voucher to allow to buy any gift you want to replace the ruined ones.\n\nOP, you are not on the wrong. Your aunt is setting herself up for a huge and painful reality check years from now where that little girl will grow up to be a very difficult person whose behaviour is hard to rein in and leaves a trail of destruction that even the authorities will not turn a blind eye to. Secondly, your aunt is setting her girl for failure where no one will put up with her spoilt and entitled attitude once that child becomes a teen and an adult. It does not surprise me if your aunt allows her child to be a nightmare party guest at other kids' birthday parties\n\nI can imagine your cousin 8 or 9 years from now throwing a huge tantrum and on a path of destruction in school for not being chosen as homecoming queen or prom date unless that behaviour is curbed on time. But I think it won't unless it takes a kind stranger to tell your aunt she is raising her kid wrong all along\n\nThe adult relatives should not call you an AH. When they do that, they are in a way enabling aunt and her child", "At 8 years old she should know better. Getting off with no consequences will encourage her to continue being a brat too. Def NTA.", "Behavior like this from an 8yo is rude, unseemly, and unacceptable.\n\nYes, you could have been a bit less harsh, but it was definitely the right thing to do. I hope your Aunt considers you words and begins reprimanding your cousin for her behavior.\n\nI'm sorry this brat ruined your birthday!", "Happy Birthday OP. \ud83e\udd73 You are NTA!", "NTA and 8 years old is plenty old enough to know what she is doing unless she has developmental issues. I\u2019m sorry about your birthday being ruined.", "NTA. Sometimes the truth needs to be told, even if it hurts.", "Tell your family that if they had been honest in the past maybe the little brat wouldn't be such a horrible brat.....that if they had addressed the issue earlier, the entire situation would have been avoided.  YOU DESERVED TO BE UPSET, and NOTHING you said was wrong.  Maybe she needed to hear it, finally.  Her daughter is EIGHT YEARS OLD, not eight MONTHS old and she knew exactly what she was doing.  She's lucky it you weren't MY daughter, I'd have kicked the kid OUT of the party (and the mom too if needed)when she did that with your gifts.   YOU'RE a better person than I am, I would have said NO, to letting the little brat help.", "[removed]", "NTA. She needs to be told and sooner rather than later. My younger cousins were like that and they grew up to be terrible people. \n\nI\u2019m like you and I have a birthday near Thanksgiving so I get why you\u2019re upset. That would\u2019ve really hurt my feelings too.", "NTA\n\nThis kid is 8yo and is a brat! You weren\u2019t rude. You\u2019d had enough.

If her 8 year old can\u2019t handle this type of situation without ruining it then it is her parent\u2019s responsibility to teach her or not being her in the first place. You were very kind. I wouldn\u2019t have even said yes to the present opening", "NTA I hate that \u201cmy kid is special\u201d thinking. It just makes entitled kids and brats.", "You didn\u2019t ruin the holiday - a bratty child did", "NTA. 8 is plenty old enough to understand what she was doing, and why it was wrong. Your aunt is doing her no favors by letting her continue acting that way. I guarantee you that non-family members are not going to mince words when confronted with that behavior.", "NTA\n\nIt's funny yet sad that a 16 year old had to tell her to stop creating a spoiled brat. \n\nPerhaps you didn't need to bring the miscarriages into it as it seems to be a  bit of a low blow. But she definitely deserved everything else you said.", "Having difficulty conceiving or bringing a baby to term is unimaginably difficult. That reality however, does not have a single thing to do with being a good parent and teaching your children manner and age appropriate behavior.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Obviously she ignored 4 previous warnings that she's not meant to be a mother.", "NTA!  Happy Birthday to you! \ud83d\udc95", "NTA", "NTA ur fine", "NTA, your aunt needs to shape up your cousin. Her behavior is unacceptable", "NTA. Happy belated birthday! :)", "NTA. This kid sounds like a toddler, not an 8 year old.", "NTA. The kid should be taught better, and your aunt should know better. The only thing you might of done wrong is yell, but it\u2019s understandable with your frustration. She blew out your candles, broke your gifts, complained about getting no presents, and destroyed your cake.\n\nHappy late birthday \ud83c\udf82", "NTA.  If your grandparents (who were hosting) didn't say anything then you're good.", "I'm sorry your sweet 16 was ruined. NTA.", "I could not agree more. Does not surprise me if OP's little cousin is a nightmare party guest that her schoolmates find her scary", "holy fuck why is everyone downvoting you", "It was most certainly her place, because it was HER birthday that was being ruined.   Yes, it would have been BETTER for hte parents to get their heads out of thier butts (and if OP were MY daughter, you better believe that kid would have been GONE after the first temper tantrum of the day) but when no one else stood up for her, she had to stand up for herself.", "OP, I passed you judgment and I am so sorry for you. You did nothing wrong telling aunt the truth", "A rainbow baby is the baby a mother has after having suffered a miscarriage.

She is now in her late twenties and she cannot hold a job for longer than a month because she can\u2019t handle the real world after being spoiled rotten by my aunt and uncle.

You are NTA.", "Even if you could, both of you would still have negative karma", "I don't know about all 8-year-olds, but what I see from my kiddo and her peers is that they are capable of pretty decent critical thinking and using appropriate behaviors the majority of the time. Sure, kids act up or make bad decisions sometimes, but hell, so do some of the most mature adults I know. \n\nIt's been my experience that kids understand more than we give them credit for\u2014if we model good habits and explain things to them in an age-appropriate way, rather than using the \"because I said so\" approach, it does them a world of good. \n\ne.g., \"You can't get the mail by yourself because people speed down the hill and I'm worried for your safety.\" vs. \"No! You can't go to the mailbox, what is wrong with you?\". \n\n\\- or -\n\n\"That's a great outfit, but we have to dress up a little more for Auntie's wedding. You can wear that for school on Monday.\" vs. \"Go change into a dress!\"\n\nI think if you trust them with complex reasoning, they'll begin to use complex reasoning. \n\nAnyway, this is super off-topic now, but yes, developmentally, most neurotypical 8-year-olds can use reasoning and know when they are acting inappropriately.", "She's in her 20s now and still wears all the bows at Christmas and Birthday parties.", "That sounds really awkward and awful", "U would be shocked how some parents treat their children like this if they are born after a loved one as passed\u2026..even if it\u2019s the parents own siblings that have passed on.

Stick to your guns, OP.  The rest of the family, who use this excuse, need to know that it won't work anymore to deflect dealing with these occurrances of bad behavior.  \nAlso, Aunt and cousin need to get some professional help.
