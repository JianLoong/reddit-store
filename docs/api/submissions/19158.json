I need some help because I think I might be the asshole here, and I\u2019m to embarrassed to ask my friends.

He hands a volunteer the microphone and the person bursts out yelling Asian slurs(I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m allowed to regale them here). I froze up and just sat there with my eyes on the ground trying not to listen as he went down the line of people on stage giving each volunteer the mic for 10-20 seconds each. About halfway through the line of volunteers I just stood up and left, leaving my husband behind and sat outside until my husband came out. \n\nWhen we got home I cried for a while, I think because I was just shocked at what I heard. My husband thinks I shouldn\u2019t have walked out and I\u2019m making a bigger deal out of it than I should because although I\u2019m Asian I\u2019m not Chinese and because the volunteers were older white people \u201cwho don\u2019t know any better. Although they are wrong they were raised in different times where it wasn\u2019t as taboo to use those words.\u201d (His words)\n\nI told him that I was shocked he was as accepting of it was he was being of slurs and that I felt sort of betrayed by him.

Yikes!", "My god, that link is horrifying. \n\nNTA a thousand times. \n\nYou had every right to remove yourself from that awful situation.

I go quiet for a bit, and afterwards one of the group members mentions how I shouldn't let it affect my day. That pissed me off A LOT. My point is, it's unfortunately one of those things that some people aren't going to \"get\".

You need to be comfortable with the person you married. \n\nI'm sorry, OP. You didn't deserve to find yourself in that situation. People who think of this sort of thing as \"humor\" don't fit into what I hope is our collective vision for the US.", "Husband. He is her husband. A little more complicated to walk away from.", "This right here. And..  the answer should be 'no'. I'm horrified/enraged at the 'comedy' but genuinely concerned/disturbed/incandescent with rage at the husband. Holy shit. I'm so sorry OP. But this is absolutely not something to let slide.
