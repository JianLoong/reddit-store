I need some help because I think I might be the asshole here, and I\u2019m to embarrassed to ask my friends. My husband (M34) and I(F32) went to a comedy stage hypnotist show a few weeks ago (I\u2019m of Asian decent and my husband is white\u2026it becomes relevant in a moment). \n\nIt started off fine, but about halfway through the hypnotist started doing a skit where he told the volunteers on stage that they(I kid you not) are a Chinese rapper. He hands a volunteer the microphone and the person bursts out yelling Asian slurs(I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m allowed to regale them here). I froze up and just sat there with my eyes on the ground trying not to listen as he went down the line of people on stage giving each volunteer the mic for 10-20 seconds each. About halfway through the line of volunteers I just stood up and left, leaving my husband behind and sat outside until my husband came out. \n\nWhen we got home I cried for a while, I think because I was just shocked at what I heard. My husband thinks I shouldn\u2019t have walked out and I\u2019m making a bigger deal out of it than I should because although I\u2019m Asian I\u2019m not Chinese and because the volunteers were older white people \u201cwho don\u2019t know any better. Although they are wrong they were raised in different times where it wasn\u2019t as taboo to use those words.\u201d (His words)\n\nI told him that I was shocked he was as accepting of it was he was being of slurs and that I felt sort of betrayed by him.

I'm very white and I would have found that very uncomfortable and would have left too. That's not funny content. \"They don't know any better\" is not a good excuse. Though I blame the hypnotist for setting the situation up to allow for racist \"humor\" in the first place, your husband is a jerk for not having your back and for telling you that you're not allowed to be upset because you're not Chinese. As if Asian slurs wouldn't hurt you or make you uncomfortable? Yikes!", "My god, that link is horrifying. \n\nNTA a thousand times. \n\nYou had every right to remove yourself from that awful situation. And the sheer audacity of your husband, a white man, to tell you, a person who has actual lived experience as a minority in white spaces, how you should react to racism is nothing short of breathtaking. \n\nAt minimum, you need a long talk about how you are the expert on your own feelings and experiences and he doesn't get to override that under any circumstances. I really hope the two of you can work this out, because this is a genuine and enormous red flag.", "NTA. It made you uncomfortable and instead of comforting you he invalidated how you feel.", "NTA\n\nWhat that 'comedian' and his volunteers did is absolutely hateful, and in no way amusing.

I hope you're okay, OP.", "NTA. That\u2019s just racism like there\u2019s not even a joke other than \u201cAsian people sound funny\u201d which is again, just being racist.  Your husband is a huge AH for trying to make excuses for a bunch of racists.", "NTA. That clip was so offensive I couldn\u2019t even finish watching. I am so sorry you had to sit through even a small part of that.\n\nAlso, even if you yourself aren\u2019t Chinese, I feel like many people use \u201cChinese\u201d as a generic term for anyone who looks Asian, which is offensive in itself. They were definitely mocking Asian people generally, not just Chinese people. Your husband doesn\u2019t get to tell you not to be hurt by this.", "NTA. And I have a similar story \n\nSo, I'm black, and was visiting Denver for a work conference with some friends (co-workers, but a few of us actually went to grad school together and were close). We were walking around downtown, and all of a sudden a guy starts yelling the n-word at me. Completely unprovoked, I just happened to be there and he was having some sort of episode. I go quiet for a bit, and afterwards one of the group members mentions how I shouldn't let it affect my day. That pissed me off A LOT. My point is, it's unfortunately one of those things that some people aren't going to \"get\". It's easy to say \"it's just words\" until it happends to you", "Is your husband typically so lacking of empathy, or this was one-off him dropping the ball?

Depending on their age, those people have learnt to use computers, smart phones, induction stoves, the internet, remote controls, ATMs, that weren't around when they were raised. They've learnt to be very comfortable that things that were totally accepted when they were raised are not okay now: drink driving, leaving kids in the car, women being fired when they got engaged... ITS VERY REASONABLE TO EXPECT PEOPLE TO LEARN THINGS.\n\nOnce the unreasonableness of something you were raised with is pointed out, if you continue that behaviour you're an unmitigated arsehole.\n\nSo, OP, you are NTA a million times over. Every single person in that room who didn't walk out (including your husband) is an AH.\n\nAre you planning to have kids? Let's stop for a moment and consider that they will also be of Asian descent. How will your husband expect them to react to the racism that tragically they are bound to face from time to time?\n\nHonestly, I'm just so angry on your behalf! I'm so sorry you had to endure this, and I'm so sorry you didn't get the support you deserve from the person who's supposed to have your back.", "NTA. \n\n>> although I\u2019m Asian I\u2019m not Chinese\n\nSo, because you\u2019re Asian but not Chinese you\u2019re not supposed to find racism directed at a specific group of Asians harmful? \n\n>> older white people \u201cwho don\u2019t know any better.

You\u2019ve got a husband who would rather make excuses for racist actions than understand how and why those actions harm you. That doesn\u2019t seem all too supportive to me.", "NTA and the whole bloody audience should have gone with you.", "NTA - the hypnotist could have chosen any one of thousands of other funny things to get people to do on that stage; but he intentionally set it up so that he could allow massive amounts of racism to happen and then say it wasn\u2019t his fault what his volunteers did.\n\nYour husband isn\u2019t seeing the problem because he isn\u2019t seeing that this *is* personal to you because you were on the receiving end of bad behaviour (even if it wasn\u2019t directed at you by name, it still related to you) whereas to him it was impersonal because it didn\u2019t affect him directly. That\u2019s insensitive, but it also suggests that he doesn\u2019t listen to you the way he should and isn\u2019t supporting you properly as your partner ought to - you were literally telling him it was hurtful and he tried to say it wasn\u2019t hurting you because *he* didn\u2019t think it important.\n\nYou took appropriate action to show both the comedian and your husband that this was a problem - the comedian doesn\u2019t have to listen but your husband will face consequences for his choices on how he handles this.\n\nIf it\u2019s not too late, don\u2019t have kids with this person until you\u2019re satisfied he understands why you have a problem with this, that he knows better than to repeat this behaviour or downplay your anger and upset (they are after all reasonable things to feel in this situation), and that he knows how to be supportive.

Your husband should have been more understanding of how you felt in that situation - and walked out with you. Making excuses for other people's bad behavior like it is okay is definitely NOT okay.", "NTA. Your husband is the AH for not leaving with you, invalidating your response, and minimizing your experience.

That's just appalling.", "NTA - His rationale and his position on this is appalling.  \"Your Asian but not Chineese....\"--OMG. The 'entertainment' was not funny. It was ugly, horrible and abusive. Leaving the venue was your brain saying freeze, fight, of flee. You have been traumatized twice: The Hypnotist and your Husband's views.  You are not being too sensitive.

Best to you.", "NTA", "That's not an excuse for use of slurs. You're NTA here.", "NTA - he should have followed, or even left first. Thats not okay, to expect you to sit there and listen to that?

I go to a comedy club to laugh. Not to hear people repeat harmful bullshit.", "nta", "NTA", "NTA. I give comedy clubs a wide berth when it comes to offensive behavior. Free speech and all that. However, if you were feeling uncomfortable, you certainly should have stepped out (as you did) and your husband should have IMMEDIATELY followed you.", "NTA. You walked out on the hypnotist who set up this horrible scenario,  not on the hypnotized people.", "Yeah, I find the pic of that guy offensive.

Did you and/or your husband know this guy's deal before you went?", "NTA \nYour husband telling you that the racism should be fine and acceptable to you is super fricking concerning. Possible he's mortified and is trying to say this as he feels crappy for putting you in that situation. Which still not ok, and he shouldn't get away with diminishing your hurt from hateful speech that targets Asians. Hell, that's the sort of thing that dehumanizes a race and promotes violence against. As oh, not the same, it's THEM. \n\nWorst case is he thinks that it's ok, and you should be ok being dehumanized, because that's what this sort of shit does. I empathize as I'm Asian with a white partner. Difference is, he would have been checking on me and asking if I wanted to leave immediately. Also not Chinese, but it doesn't matter. \n\nDemand more, if he's going to date a person of color he doesn't get to pull the you need to tolerate  this.", "NTA. Who cares if you\u2019re not specifically Chinese? I have always said, if someone is capable of being bigoted to one group, you\u2019re just a stone\u2019s throw away. In this case, it sounds like it was more of a stone\u2019s toss. Besides, slurs get used very indiscriminately as long as you fit the \u2018type.\u2019 It would have made anyone with a shred of decency uncomfortable. I\u2019m sorry you had to experience this and that your husband couldn\u2019t just support and comfort you out the gate before jumping to make excuses.
