He hands a volunteer the microphone and the person bursts out yelling Asian slurs(I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m allowed to regale them here). I froze up and just sat there with my eyes on the ground trying not to listen as he went down the line of people on stage giving each volunteer the mic for 10-20 seconds each. About halfway through the line of volunteers I just stood up and left, leaving my husband behind and sat outside until my husband came out. \n\nWhen we got home I cried for a while, I think because I was just shocked at what I heard. My husband thinks I shouldn\u2019t have walked out and I\u2019m making a bigger deal out of it than I should because although I\u2019m Asian I\u2019m not Chinese and because the volunteers were older white people \u201cwho don\u2019t know any better.

I go quiet for a bit, and afterwards one of the group members mentions how I shouldn't let it affect my day. That pissed me off A LOT. My point is, it's unfortunately one of those things that some people aren't going to \"get\".
