Your SIL was gracious in apologizing for her overreaction but instead of accepting the apology, your husband continued by making an unhelpful comment about being overprotective or a ONE MONTH OLD BABY that they had medical difficulties with after birthing that required staying in NICU.\n\nYour mum clearly stated they were upset with your husband's comments but you're instead focusing on changing the diaper as the issue. Surprised you're the older sister with the way you're carrying on.", "You are NTA\n\nYour husband is TA for his \"you can't protect the baby forever\" bullshit. If the baby has a bad allergic reaction to disposable diapers then SIL made a perfectly reasonable request that \"next time, just point it out and let us deal with it\". Your husband owes them an apology.", "YTA. In general you should always ask permission to change the diaper if somebody else\u2019s kid, since it is their private parts and you do not want to get in a situation where the parent was not comfortable with that.", "Your husband  is TA\u2026 it\u2019s not just a diaper\u2026 and it seems like before he jumped in SIL was understanding but trying to convey the urgency", "N T A but your husband 100% is. Your SIL apologized and explained her reaction, and he doubled down on invalidating her concerns. You weren't an AH for changing the diaper since it doesn't sound like you knew about the allergic reaction possibility, but everything after SIL's apology means that your husband owes SIL a huge apology.     \n    \nUpdate: changing to YTA after reading some of your other comments. No matter how protective your husband is, his response was wrong. And as for SIL being \"aggressive\" when taking the baby from you: that's her child, and she was afraid her child was going to be in danger. You're telling me that if you thought your child was in danger, you wouldn't do the same thing? I call bs on that.", "YTA and so is your husband. They were polite and rightfully concerned. The two of you wouldn\u2019t let it go. You owe them an apology.", "YTA.  You overstepped and risked injuring a newborn baby.  That\u2019s what allergies do to newborns.  She reacted accordingly but then apologized to assuage your ego. \n\nThey told you how *you hurt their newborn* unknowingly, forgave you for it, then told you how they preferred to handle that specific parenting situation in the future so as not to *physically hurt their newborn.*  Rather than apologize and agree to not physically hurt their newborn, you double downed on why they shouldn\u2019t be mad that you physically hurt their newborn and won\u2019t agree to follow their parenting guidelines in the future.  I would not let you around my kid in the future, because you think ignoring my reasonable requests and *physically hurting a newborn* is okay if it is just a diaper and you know better than me about my own kid.", "YTA - You should never change a baby's nappy without the parents permission. Especially not using disposable wipes or diapers", "YTA  more your husband  for his further comments.  But both of you for acting like she\u2019s being overprotective/ridiculous because she\u2019s not. I\u2019ve worked with babies that are allergic to disposable diapers. They\u2019re bottoms become red, swollen, painful, bleeding wounds. Id have pulled that diaper off ASAP too.", "YTA. I think changing the baby from a cloth diaper to a disposable diaper was misguided, even if you were just trying to help. You were in their home, there was no reason not to just tell them it looked like she needed a change and let them handle it.\n\nYour husband absolutely escalated this to asshole territory. Your SIL apologized for an overreaction and offered a completely reasonable explanation and your husband doubled down. It's not just a diaper. The baby has allergic reactions to disposable diapers. Parents can and absolutely protect their kids from that. Your husband was just being an asshole at that point. \n\nI would have just voted your husband the asshole but if you can't see that he was out of line you're one too.", "YTA.  The baby's parents were present and you were at her home with her supplies.  \n\nEven using a different brand of disposable diaper can cause some babies to break out in a painful rash that can take over a week to heal - you and your husband are being obnoxious by acting like the parents should feel what you did was no big deal.\n\nIf you were babysitting your niece without her parents, her diaper bag was out of supplies, and you didn't know about her allergy, then using one of your own diapers would be appropriate.  Under the circumstances you are in it was not.  \n\nMy guess is most the N T A votes have not parented babies.", "[deleted]", "Eh. Soft YTA. I wouldn\u2019t of changed a baby in a cloth diaper into a disposable without asking first, especially since you were in the same house as the parents. It would throw a red flag to me. I would\u2019ve just let them know baby needed changing or just asked where their cloth diapers were. Your husband is def TA though for escalating the situation.", "So she only wears cloth diapers? Wouldn't you have noticed that when you checked before changing her? It sounds like you and your husband think the allergy is fake and are trying to force SIL to do what you think is best. You're husband saying your SIL cant protect her baby forever is ridiculous. What does that have to do with exposing the baby to an allergen? Like you can't protect them forever, let's start hurting them immediately? This is all nuts. YTA and your husband is also an AH. I wouldn't leave my baby around  either of you or let you hold them again if it were me in this situation.", "YTA for continuing to push the issues after she apologized for her reaction and explained that she reacted that way *because of her baby having an allergy*. This isn\u2019t about protecting her baby forever, it\u2019s about avoiding a painful diaper rash *right now*.", "Your husband is TA here. He's the only one, and he needs to apologize. You were NTA for changing the diaper. You apologized for the misunderstanding/not knowing, SIL accepted the apology, and everything was fine until your husband butted in with the line, \"You can't protect your baby forever.\"\n\nNot exposing your 1m baby to a known allergy is not being overprotective. That's being a good parent. SIL maybe shouldn't have freaked out, but immediately taking off the diaper and putting a cloth diaper on her is totally warranted here. And even though you were trying to help, you could have caused major harm. So \"critiquing\" or stopping that harm is warranted.", "No one here was an asshole until your husband started digging in his heels and getting defensive.  Then he was the asshole.  Seems like a simple misunderstanding that was handled well right up until then.", "Can't protect the baby forever ?  She's a month old and some of that was sent in a NICU. They can be as protective as they want. \n\nYou tried to be helpful.  I personally would have seen the cloth diaper and brought their baby out to them saying, \"She needs a change, where do you keep the cloth diapers?\" I wouldn't have necessarily thought of allergies first, I would have assumed that would have come up in general conversation with my sister.  I just would have assumed they had a reason for their preference and I'll fitting diapers frequently lead to leaks, especially on girls. \n\nSounds Ike the accepted your apology and all was good.  You were NTA.  Your husband, on the other hand, was a massive AH.  He was totally inconsiderate of their feelings and made a very rude comment. I hope that he gets it when you explain why what he said was out of line.", "YTA. You don't change another person's baby's diaper without their permission, that's big overstepping. Most parents I know have a short list of very specific people who are allowed to change and bathe their babies. You're lucky the mom was so kind about you changing her baby's diaper and almost giving her her an allergic reaction.", "INFO: Did you not notice that the baby was in a different type of diaper?\n\nAs a parent, that would give me pause. I would stop and ask the other parent as soon as I saw the cloth diaper and see what materials they had. You\u2019d also have to place the dirty cloth diaper somewhere, right? This all requires communication with the parent. Why didn\u2019t you talk to the mother as soon as you noticed this?", "YTA \n\nI\u2019m confused though why you didn\u2019t say something to them especially when you saw your niece had on a cloth diaper and you didn\u2019t have the right size diaper for her. \n\nYour husband\u2019s reaction is also very AH. An allergy is not something that others should disregard.", "YTA the kid has allergies. You didn't know and now you do. Accept it and move on. There's no reason to get so defensive over it", "YTA. I really don't know why you wouldn't just ask her moms before changing her; when I was a nanny it was SOP to double check before using a new product on a baby. But even if that wasn't done maliciously, your husband has no right to snap at your SIL that she can't protect her one month old, fresh from the NICU baby forever from a known allergen, and I completely get why she told him to leave.", "NTA- for changing your nieces diaper when it needed a change. YTA- for not moving on and saying \u201cshe can\u2019t protect her baby forever\u201d\u2026?! Who says that to a parent who just had their baby in the NICU. You should have dropped it.", "YTA why wouldn\u2019t you notice the cloth diaper on the baby? It\u2019s there for a reason. Why would you expect the parents to be ok with a regular diaper?", "NTA, but your husband sure is. \n\nThis kid is apparently allergic. You didn\u2019t know that, so putting her in another diaper was an understandable mistake. Your SIL got upset, then apologized for overreacting and asked you to let them handle your allergic niece. \n\nEverything would have been fine if it had stopped there.\n\nSo why didn\u2019t it? That\u2019s the million dollar question. Why did your husband have to go on the aggressive when it could have been over? Why did he look at an almost-extinguished campfire and go, \u201cYou know what this needs? Gasoline!\u201d", "NTA for changing the diaper.\n\nYou're focusing on the wrong part of the story here. You were being helpful, SIL freaked out on you, then apologized for freaking out and explained why she freaked out. That should have been the end of it. No one was the AH up to that point. However, your husband is an AH for keeping the topic going and turning it into a fight by being so dismissive about the baby's wellbeing and your SIL's admited overprotectiveness of her newborn who was recently in NICU. And you are an AH for trying to say your family is mad at you for changing a diaper. That's not why your family is mad at your husband and you know it.", "NTA, your husband is. Everyone did the right thing here and then he butted in with his unwarranted opinions", "YTA. My 2nd child had a reaction to many brand name diapers. Thank goodness we didn't have to use cloth,  even though they are better for the environment. I would have been annoyed if they changed them without asking for this reason as well!!", "YTA for supporting your husband. You both were wrong here and your SIL kindly explained you the same. Instead of agreeing with your mistake and ensuring you don't repeat it, your husband blamed your SIL and it looks like you agree with him. If your roles were reversed I believe your husband would have made even a bigger scene to protect his kid.", "Going to agree with the YTA, gently YTA for you, you meant well. And now you know. Amends were made...but HTA for your husband yikes. You were in their home, presumably with their diapering supplies in that home and you knew it was a cloth diaper. I mean, I would never change another kid's diaper without asking first to begin with, and I would be upset if someone had done that to one of my kiddos w/o asking. And I would not assume it ok to put a cloth-diapered kiddo into a disposable without asking. It would not have taken much to go \"Hey kiddo needs a diaper, want me to get it? Where are your diapering supplies?\" NICU or not, it is reasonable especially for first-time parents ot be protective, and overprotective. Thier kiddo ya know?  Your hubby needs to apologize though.", "YTA\n\nWhere was the conversation before taking unconsented, and frankly, uninformed action?", "Not your baby, not your choice. YTA", "NTA for changing the diaper without knowing. Husband is kinda an AH for pushing it once he and you were informed. Husband should apologize. SIL was a bit off by saying you should have gotten her or your sister, they should have told you before hand but that isn't that bad. New parenting is hard especially with health issues like allergies.", "I would say you're NTA, but your husband is. Your SIL apologized for her over-reaction. That should've been the end of it.

And I will add- Everybody has different boundaries with their baby as well and while what you did was not wrong it\u2019s probably always best to ask before you do anything to anyone else\u2019s baby.

Like a simple \u201cshe\u2019s got a dirty diaper do you want me to change it\u201d would have been good, but as a mom to a 5 month old little girl I can\u2019t say I\u2019d be thrilled if someone took it upon themselves to change my babies diaper unless I specifically asked them to or it was like a babysitting situation where that was expected.", "Yep. Husband made it weird.", "This answer is exactly right. The SIL apologized, and they should have left it at that. DH had to push it further and made an ass of himself. He owes an apology to SIL.", "yeah, this is what I don't get - they were in SIL's home, with all the baby's nappy supplies available, and SIL and OP's sister were home. OP could have easily asked where things were AND checked that she had permission. If she had asked, none of this would have happened.\n\nI did a mix of cloth and disposable nappies with my children - one kid would get the most awful nappy rash from cloth, even with all the creams and fancy liners and every \"silver bullet\" technique. It took a fair bit of experimenting to figure out what worked for that baby and was pretty stressful, and that was without any allergy or NICU stuff going on.", "This right here. 10 minutes more won\u2019t impact diaper rash to the degree that a severe allergic reaction would. This screams \u201cwe\u2019re the better parents and they\u2019re just eco-friendly and entitled\u201d to me.", "Did op not notice that her niece was in a cloth diaper?

If you were the one having an allergen pressed against your crotch, wouldn't you want someone to act quickly to remove it before the reaction got worse.\n\nIt's also perfectly reasonable to expect that if your baby is in your home and someone else is holding her, they'd ask before changing her diaper. I'm not a mom, but I used to nanny, and it was pretty common knowledge (imo) that you should always double check before using a new product on a baby, specifically to avoid situations like this. Both of her parents were home, so you could have just taken a minute to ask before assuming. I think changing her wasn't actually a full-on AH move, just a little thoughtless, but acting like your feelings are more important than keeping your niece from having an allergic reaction on her genitals really does make YTA.", "She\u2019d already apologized for her reaction. He should have let it go.", "Perhaps some of this is about inexperience - you don't say if your son is your first child or if you have had much experience with babies.\n\nGenerally, when you're changing someone else's baby, you ask the parents for permission first, and then you ask where the nappy changing supplies are and if there is any creams/lotions etc that need using. And if you're changing a baby that wears something you aren't used to (cloth and you use disposable, or vice versa), then you check with them to make sure you're getting it right. \n\nIt is perfectly reasonable for someone with a 1 month old who already has a complex medical history to rush to take a nappy that will cause a rash off as soon as possible - nappy rashes are not only uncomfortable for the baby, but can be a source of infection that can cause more problems than usual in a baby with a compromised immune system. Your SIL's focus was on the wellbeing of her baby.\n\nYour SIL apologised for being abrupt with you and explained the situation - your husband had no place to then tell her she was being overprotective and that her daughter's allergy was no big deal. He wasn't protecting you from anything at this point, because there was never any attack. You overstepped, the situation was managed, your feelings got hurt in the process, you got the apology and explanation you felt you deserved, and then your husband kept going on about it until your sister had to threaten to kick him out to get him to stop hassling her wife. \n\nFor just a moment, imagine if someone did something to your own baby that could cause them harm and then they got upset when you rushed in to stop them, and then after you apologised (but they didn't), their spouse kept having a go at you about it and tried to make it sound like it was all no big deal. And your husband has to threaten to kick them out of the house before they will stop behaving like an asshole. Who would you say is in the wrong there?\n\nYou're not an asshole for trying to help. But you are absoloutely an asshole for siding with your husband (also an asshole) who dismissed the medical needs of a baby and was so \"protective\" he was told to leave if he couldn't get himself under control. He would *never* (I hope) have put up with that kind of behaviour being directed at you, but is apparently ok with doing it to another mother.

He\u2019s an asshole, and so are you if you keep trying to justify his bullshit.", "Are you actually still defending him? \n\nYou exposed your neice to a contact allergen. Contact allergens cause more damage the longer a person is exposed to it. It also could be the \"absorbent\" chemicals that she would be exposed to more if she peed.

Really, what would you do? \n\nThe first thing ANY parent would do is see to their child. In that moment, your feelings didn't matter, her child's health is all that mattered to her. *That is not getting aggressive* with you, that's being a parent. \n\nAccording to your OP, your SIL already apologized BEFORE your husband got aggressive.

Your husband's actions are the ONLY reason the situation escalated. \n\nWhere is your empathy? \n\nDo you have any idea how it feels to see your baby in a NICU? That doesn't happen for no reason. It means something went wrong. My middle child was a premi. She was OK but still had to stay in the NICU 2 days after I was discharged. I can't even begin to explain the physical and emotional toll that took on me. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. That's what they just went through. That's not a smooth journey to parenthood. \n\nWhen a baby is discharged from the NICU they tell you to avoid unnecessary social contact until at least your first follow-up. Waiting a month to introduce family slowly makes perfect medical sense. Yet you seem to think it was excessive, otherwise why mention it? \n\nYour husband's comments also show a complete lack of empathy and understanding. As if they are acting somehow excessively protective of a 1month old baby that had a rough start. \n\n\n>My husband knows me very well and could tell that it upset me because I was trying to help.\n\nDoes that happen a lot to you? Where people react poorly to you \"trying to help?\" \n\nIt's not \"trying to help\" when you don't think about the wishes of the person you are supposed to be\"helping.\" \n\nThey invited you to their home right? You were in the babies home and couldn't be bothered to look for her things, when she had a cloth diaper on? How does that make any sense? How is that \"helping?\" \n\nWere you and your husband changing your baby on the floor or on her changing table? Did you just ignore the cloth diapers? Or was it too much trouble to finish the job properly? \n\nHer parents were in the other room, you could have asked for help. \n\nI've changed my younger siblings diapers and I still would not have done what you did. Because that's their child. \n\nThere are so many boundaries you crossed in your misguided attempt to help. You never change another person's child without permission unless they have entrusted you to do that. \n\nEspecially when you are in their home with them present. \n\nJust like you don't give a baby food without clearing it with the parents first. \n\nAnd why would they have to inform you of the reason for cloth diapers. You were in their home, with their supplies present and available. There was no reason to go into that because there was no reason for it to come up. \n\nYes YTA and so is your husband.
