She can choose to accept that or continue trying to make things about herself.  If she chooses the latter, she will forfeit her invitation altogether.", "Mom is speaking from her guilt of not providing you with a father and finds herself trying to make up for lost time. I have a three year old and I really avoid him meeting men I date but I badly want him to have a father as he deserves that. I was also single before he was born as his dad is a sociopath, unbeknownst to me as they are good at hiding things from others. I grew up in a nice middle class family with two parents , two brothers, and a dog with a metal fence so to find out my son would not have the same was devastating to me. I am constantly re-examining myself on how I can raise my \u2018stock to attract a viable safe and loving mate and step father. I never planned to be a single mom. Your mom feels like a failure and feels hurt she couldn\u2019t give you what she wanted for you. Give her a break, but have who you want to walk you down the aisle. A close family member perhaps and try to at least get to know her husband.", "NTA. My mom was a single mom and she dated around, but I only ever met two boyfriends in 16 years of living with her. One I absolutely hated and the other I loved. Neither ended up being my dad. You cannot force feelings and at 32, the only father I acknowledge is my mom's best friend. He was the only one that was there for all the important things. The only constant and he always calls me his oldest daughter (he has three teenage daughters).", "NTA", "NTA. Sorry, I just hate it when a woman thinks her life isn't complete without a man. She has to get her self worth from a p*nis. It's a terrible example to set for kids.", "NTA. You can't force those kinds of relationships. They have to develop naturally or not.", "NTA. \n\nI'm a single mother of 2 and I've dated maybe 2 guys over the last 4 years; neither of them met my kids, and the #1 reason? I do t want anyone arou.d my kids who won't stay around them. \n\nPersonally, I feel the right way to go about this would be to date until you're sure you and the man have a good chance of lasting, then slowly introduce them to your child and see if we work as a family unit. \n\nIntroducing you to every man she considered was not a good way to go about it and I'm sorry you had to grow up like that. A revolving door of 'father figures' can really affect a child smh", "NTA - and technically even if he was your biological father and/or you had a wonderful relationship, you STILL didn\u2019t need to have him walk you down the aisle. The custom is from when women were considered their father\u2019s property and became their husband\u2019s property when married. You can just skip this if it doesn\u2019t align with you regardless of familiar relationships. \n\nYour mother felt guilt over you not having a \u201cproper father\u201d and if you have him in this role at your wedding it would be about alleviating her guilt  over how you grew up, and not at all about your relationship with her husband. It is not your responsibility to make her feel better about her life choices, there are therapists for that.", "NTA in the least, and after everything she expected of you, the way you laid it out for her was kind and gentle, all things considered. \n\n\nAfter my ex-husband and I divorced, this was one of my biggest fears when I started dating. My daughter knew her now step-dad before he and I became serious, because he was already in the picture, so I was lucky. My husband, however, asked for her permission to marry me. It was a rule of mine- if my kid isn\u2019t okay, I\u2019m not okay. And she said no the first time! So we put it on the back burner and gave her time to explore how she felt about him. He made sure to ask *her* what she needed/wanted to feel better about us being together. It really came down to the fact that she wanted me to be with her Dad (my ex). At this point, it has been 3 years since the divorce, so my ex and I sat with her and explained that no matter what, we were both still her parents, and no one is filling any roles- she\u2019s just being given a bigger family that loves her. \n\n\nWhen she finally said yes, we got married. I didn\u2019t want anyone to give me away, because, well\u2026 I wasn\u2019t property of anyone. But my daughter stood by my side through the whole ceremony. That was (coming up on) 7 years ago. Today, she goes back and forth to referring to my husband as \u201cDad\u201d and \u201cname\u201d, depending on how she\u2019s feeling. And my husband is okay with it. He refers to her as his daughter, but doesn\u2019t expect anything out of her that doesn\u2019t make her comfortable. \n\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you went through what you did. Congrats on getting married, and I\u2019ll leave this: our officiant said the following words at the beginning of our ceremony: \u201cno one is giving anyone away here today, because these two are coming to each other of their own free will, as equals\u201d.", "NTA...OP your feelings are real, hold weight and perfectly valid..MOM needs to get off your case and GIVE the understanding she is asking you for....", "Nta. Your feelings are valid and she can't force them to change just because she wants to play happy families. Enjoy your wedding", "If the ages weren\u2019t wrong I\u2019d swear this was written by one of my niblings.  NTA, OP, your mother is (and has been for a very long time) living in a fantasy land, or at least trying to.  Try to do better for your life and your future than she did in hers.  Don\u2019t let your mother draw you into her version of reality.  My niblings had long-lasting damage from this behavior from their mother - she had this vision in her head of this perfect, TV family and refused to accept a world where her life was anything less than that.  When unrealistic expectations did not materialize, instead of making a happy life for herself that wasn\u2019t made for TV she fell into deep depression and now her children don\u2019t even speak to her.  It\u2019s so sad.", "NTA, like at all. \nI get that when your mom finally did settle down she hoped you all would be a happy little family together, which might've happened if she hadn't done that a zillion times before already. By age 15 you're old enough to not need or want a new daddy when you've never had one. \nAnd the whole patriarchal tradition of the dad walking you down the aisle is wonderful if the bride likes that, but to have some guy you don't care about 'give you away' because your mom wants that is just awful.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019ve recently divorced (approaching 2 years) and have custody of our kids (2 girls). My ex is now on his 2nd girlfriend while I\u2019m still living the single life. He\u2019s introduced our kids to both women and while my kids think they\u2019re \u201cnice\u201d, I feel it\u2019s so inappropriate. I date around but have so much healing and growth to continue for myself, room for a man in my life is nonexistent. My standards for a man that\u2019ll eventually come into my life as a boyfriend will have to match the energy of a father figure for my kids. They have a dad, so they don\u2019t one. I\u2019ve set a couple of rules for myself that I heavily abide by and all the dates I\u2019ve been on, men I\u2019ve hooked up with, and men that are companions, never has one ever met my kids. Shit, they\u2019re lucky if I even talk about my kids. I\u2019m protective yes, but also mindful of what \u201cmeeting mommy\u2019s new bf\u201d every other month can do to a child\u2019s wellbeing. I\u2019m so sorry your mom put you through that throughout your young life. She was selfish beyond any means I think I am. You\u2019re doing good for you, so keep doing!!\n\nMy rules:\n1) Is this a me thing or a we thing? Me thing, just me and the guy and he\u2019ll never meet my kids. We thing, he\u2019ll meet my kids because my relationship with him is blossoming beyond companionship as long as\u2026\n\n2)\u2026he gets the good ol\u2019 thumbs up from the people in my life that I trust most. He\u2019s got to meet the adults before the kids.", "The way your mom behaved when you were a child was unconscionable. She was so desperate not to be alone that she emotionally traumatized her own child over and over again in the desperate hope that each guy would be \u201cthe one\u201d. She had no real emotional investment in any of them, so why would you (sarcasm)? \n\nThat is a recipe for such disaster. Predators target women like your mother for the explicit purpose of gaining access to their vulnerable children. You didn\u2019t mention anything like this in your post and I hope that\u2019s because you truly never encountered it. But even dodging that horrendous bullet, your mom trained you that the way of things is that men (more broadly romantic partners, but in this case, men) sweep in and out of your life, treat you however they want, and sweep out again with no commitment and no responsibility. You get attached and ripped apart over and over and you just have to take it. These are lessons that people spend years in therapy unlearning. Your mom was\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026to lonely or too desperate or too immature to register the damage she was doing when you were a child. But she\u2019s not lonely or desperate now and if she\u2019s still too immature to confront the issue, you can\u2019t fix it for her. \n\nThe relationship you and she have now is the one that she helped build. Whatever justifications she has for her behavior don\u2019t change how it affected you and you are NTA here. Not for how you feel and not for what you said. Best wishes to you and your soon to be spouse for a joyful wedding and marriage.", "You quite literally met a parade of boyfriends and now this one is somehow special. NTA I don\u2019t know why she would expect this of you considering some of them you only met once.", "Nb010p", "NTA", "NTA.  \n\nBeing a single parent is difficult, but your mom really crossed a ton of boundaries by involving you with so many of her boyfriends.  As a child without a father figure in your life, how were you supposed to make sense of that?\n\nRegardless of that aspect of things, you are an individual person with your own feelings, needs, wants and desires.  Your mom has no control over any of that.  She can't force you to feel something you don't, and good for you for not just trying to appease her.  \n\nCongratulations on your marriage!  You should always just do what's best for you.", "Your mum sounded like a revolving door, how the heck can she expect you to open and prepare to let her husband close that is in your mum.\n\nIt is your mum's fault you are who you are.\n\nIt's your mum's fault you have no connection to her husband.\n\nIf your mum actually cared more about you than getting laid maybe you would have given her husband a chance.\n\nHer choices have now back fired, because she cannot force you to be kind and good.\n\nYour mum needs a reality check, just because he's her husband doesn't mean you need to have a relationship with him.\n\nHave an amazing wedding day and remember do what you want it's yours and your partners day.", "Exactly.  Technical relationships don't create emotional bonds.", "Is Sir Ian McKellen available? I\u2019m a grown arse man and I want Gandalf to give me away.", "[removed]", "This is the best answer I\u2019ve seen so far", "I\u2019m sorry but neither moms or dads should bring a revolving door of partners to a young child growing up. If that makes me a slut shamer so be it.", "Honestly, read the post. OP\u2019s mom was constantly bringing different dudes in and introducing them as OP\u2019s future dad. At some point any kid will get sick of it. That\u2019s not slut shaming, that\u2019s facts. She created a revolving door that left OP without an opportunity to bond and form a relationship. Grow up.", "That would be brilliant!", "I want Walken to do the honours.", "comment stolen from u/justmeat23", "Good bot\n\nEdit: or...good redditor? Pls don't laugh, I'm old"]}
