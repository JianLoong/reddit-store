I know of my biological father and his family. I know who they are and even confirmed at 19 through Ancestry that they were my biological relatives but they don't want me and I don't want them. From a very young age I knew my mom dated a lot. She introduced me to almost every guy she was with. Some I would see twice at most and would hear from her that she loved them and wanted us to be a family and then they'd be gone. Others stuck around a little longer and a few of those were better to me than she was. They were kind, accepting of me being there and would make me smile. While mom always put the weight of her relationships on my shoulders and would tell me how I needed to behave and make a good impression and accept that I was getting a new daddy.

Some of her boyfriends I bonded really well with and was sad when they were gone, others I was glad to never see again and some I was truly indifferent toward.\n\nBy the time I was 12 I was just over it and decided to just exist when she'd bring me around guys and think of other stuff and make plans with friends.

So I'm indifferent to him and I have no special bond with him. I don't consider him my father figure or parent.

She told me how she couldn't wait to see me on her husband's arm, going down the aisle and I told her it wouldn't happen. We argued.

The reason this is bugging me and making me ask is she was a single mom and had no other support and she found someone she loved enough to marry and he seems to treat her pretty well and I just don't really care about him and have never tried to have a more familial relationship with him. I was just fine with him marrying her and that being it. But she wants more and she was on her own with me (in terms of raising me) for so long, maybe it's cruel for me to say what I did to her.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
