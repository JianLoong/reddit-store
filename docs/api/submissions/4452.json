She can choose to accept that or continue trying to make things about herself.  If she chooses the latter, she will forfeit her invitation altogether.", "Mom is speaking from her guilt of not providing you with a father and finds herself trying to make up for lost time. I have a three year old and I really avoid him meeting men I date but I badly want him to have a father as he deserves that. I was also single before he was born as his dad is a sociopath, unbeknownst to me as they are good at hiding things from others. I grew up in a nice middle class family with two parents , two brothers, and a dog with a metal fence so to find out my son would not have the same was devastating to me. I am constantly re-examining myself on how I can raise my \u2018stock to attract a viable safe and loving mate and step father. I never planned to be a single mom. Your mom feels like a failure and feels hurt she couldn\u2019t give you what she wanted for you. Give her a break, but have who you want to walk you down the aisle. A close family member perhaps and try to at least get to know her husband.", "NTA. My mom was a single mom and she dated around, but I only ever met two boyfriends in 16 years of living with her. One I absolutely hated and the other I loved. Neither ended up being my dad. You cannot force feelings and at 32, the only father I acknowledge is my mom's best friend. He was the only one that was there for all the important things. The only constant and he always calls me his oldest daughter (he has three teenage daughters).", "NTA", "NTA. Sorry, I just hate it when a woman thinks her life isn't complete without a man. She has to get her self worth from a p*nis. It's a terrible example to set for kids.", "NTA. You can't force those kinds of relationships. They have to develop naturally or not.", "NTA. \n\nI'm a single mother of 2 and I've dated maybe 2 guys over the last 4 years; neither of them met my kids, and the #1 reason? I do t want anyone arou.d my kids who won't stay around them. \n\nPersonally, I feel the right way to go about this would be to date until you're sure you and the man have a good chance of lasting, then slowly introduce them to your child and see if we work as a family unit. \n\nIntroducing you to every man she considered was not a good way to go about it and I'm sorry you had to grow up like that. A revolving door of 'father figures' can really affect a child smh", "NTA - and technically even if he was your biological father and/or you had a wonderful relationship, you STILL didn\u2019t need to have him walk you down the aisle. The custom is from when women were considered their father\u2019s property and became their husband\u2019s property when married. You can just skip this if it doesn\u2019t align with you regardless of familiar relationships. \n\nYour mother felt guilt over you not having a \u201cproper father\u201d and if you have him in this role at your wedding it would be about alleviating her guilt  over how you grew up, and not at all about your relationship with her husband. It is not your responsibility to make her feel better about her life choices, there are therapists for that.", "NTA in the least, and after everything she expected of you, the way you laid it out for her was kind and gentle, all things considered. \n\n\nAfter my ex-husband and I divorced, this was one of my biggest fears when I started dating. My daughter knew her now step-dad before he and I became serious, because he was already in the picture, so I was lucky. My husband, however, asked for her permission to marry me. It was a rule of mine- if my kid isn\u2019t okay, I\u2019m not okay. And she said no the first time! So we put it on the back burner and gave her time to explore how she felt about him. He made sure to ask *her* what she needed/wanted to feel better about us being together. It really came down to the fact that she wanted me to be with her Dad (my ex). At this point, it has been 3 years since the divorce, so my ex and I sat with her and explained that no matter what, we were both still her parents, and no one is filling any roles- she\u2019s just being given a bigger family that loves her. \n\n\nWhen she finally said yes, we got married. I didn\u2019t want anyone to give me away, because, well\u2026 I wasn\u2019t property of anyone. But my daughter stood by my side through the whole ceremony. That was (coming up on) 7 years ago. Today, she goes back and forth to referring to my husband as \u201cDad\u201d and \u201cname\u201d, depending on how she\u2019s feeling. And my husband is okay with it. He refers to her as his daughter, but doesn\u2019t expect anything out of her that doesn\u2019t make her comfortable. \n\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you went through what you did. Congrats on getting married, and I\u2019ll leave this: our officiant said the following words at the beginning of our ceremony: \u201cno one is giving anyone away here today, because these two are coming to each other of their own free will, as equals\u201d.", "NTA...OP your feelings are real, hold weight and perfectly valid..MOM needs to get off your case and GIVE the understanding she is asking you for....", "Nta. Your feelings are valid and she can't force them to change just because she wants to play happy families. Enjoy your wedding", "If the ages weren\u2019t wrong I\u2019d swear this was written by one of my niblings.  NTA, OP, your mother is (and has been for a very long time) living in a fantasy land, or at least trying to.  Try to do better for your life and your future than she did in hers.  Don\u2019t let your mother draw you into her version of reality.  My niblings had long-lasting damage from this behavior from their mother - she had this vision in her head of this perfect, TV family and refused to accept a world where her life was anything less than that.  When unrealistic expectations did not materialize, instead of making a happy life for herself that wasn\u2019t made for TV she fell into deep depression and now her children don\u2019t even speak to her.  It\u2019s so sad.", "NTA, like at all. \nI get that when your mom finally did settle down she hoped you all would be a happy little family together, which might've happened if she hadn't done that a zillion times before already. By age 15 you're old enough to not need or want a new daddy when you've never had one. \nAnd the whole patriarchal tradition of the dad walking you down the aisle is wonderful if the bride likes that, but to have some guy you don't care about 'give you away' because your mom wants that is just awful.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019ve recently divorced (approaching 2 years) and have custody of our kids (2 girls). My ex is now on his 2nd girlfriend while I\u2019m still living the single life. He\u2019s introduced our kids to both women and while my kids think they\u2019re \u201cnice\u201d, I feel it\u2019s so inappropriate. I date around but have so much healing and growth to continue for myself, room for a man in my life is nonexistent. My standards for a man that\u2019ll eventually come into my life as a boyfriend will have to match the energy of a father figure for my kids. They have a dad, so they don\u2019t one. I\u2019ve set a couple of rules for myself that I heavily abide by and all the dates I\u2019ve been on, men I\u2019ve hooked up with, and men that are companions, never has one ever met my kids. Shit, they\u2019re lucky if I even talk about my kids. I\u2019m protective yes, but also mindful of what \u201cmeeting mommy\u2019s new bf\u201d every other month can do to a child\u2019s wellbeing. I\u2019m so sorry your mom put you through that throughout your young life. She was selfish beyond any means I think I am. You\u2019re doing good for you, so keep doing!!\n\nMy rules:\n1) Is this a me thing or a we thing? Me thing, just me and the guy and he\u2019ll never meet my kids. We thing, he\u2019ll meet my kids because my relationship with him is blossoming beyond companionship as long as\u2026\n\n2)\u2026he gets the good ol\u2019 thumbs up from the people in my life that I trust most. He\u2019s got to meet the adults before the kids.", "The way your mom behaved when you were a child was unconscionable. She was so desperate not to be alone that she emotionally traumatized her own child over and over again in the desperate hope that each guy would be \u201cthe one\u201d. She had no real emotional investment in any of them, so why would you (sarcasm)? \n\nThat is a recipe for such disaster. Predators target women like your mother for the explicit purpose of gaining access to their vulnerable children. You didn\u2019t mention anything like this in your post and I hope that\u2019s because you truly never encountered it. But even dodging that horrendous bullet, your mom trained you that the way of things is that men (more broadly romantic partners, but in this case, men) sweep in and out of your life, treat you however they want, and sweep out again with no commitment and no responsibility. You get attached and ripped apart over and over and you just have to take it. These are lessons that people spend years in therapy unlearning. Your mom was\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026to lonely or too desperate or too immature to register the damage she was doing when you were a child. But she\u2019s not lonely or desperate now and if she\u2019s still too immature to confront the issue, you can\u2019t fix it for her. \n\nThe relationship you and she have now is the one that she helped build.

Tell her you didn\u2019t want a dad, you didn\u2019t need a dad - because you had her and she was enough for you, that you\u2019re a complete family just the two of you. \nIf you\u2019re not open to healing things with her I get that and honestly either way congratulations and I wish you the best!", "Nta", "Nta", "NTA! OP, your mom should feel grateful that you still\nHave a relationship with her! Congratulations on your wedding!", "NTA.", "OP, you articulated your position very well about how your mother's actions have affected you and how you responded to it. You have unpacked a lot and I'm impressed at your mature and well-reasoned response to a terrible situation. NTA", "NTA\nHow about you & your groom start this marriage journey together & walk each other down the aisle?", "Yep, my dad got remarried about 4 years ago and I still don\u2019t have anything more than a polite relationship with his new wife.", "She probably scared off a lot of these guys by talking about becoming a family way too early in the relationship. The guy she eventually married was probably the first one who wasn't bothered by that.", "[removed]", "100% agree! I respected my husband more because he didn't have me meet his kids right off the bat. Same with when we got married, we talked to them about it before we became engaged to make sure they were OK with it. They absolutely got a say in whether or not I was to become a permanent member of their family, luckily they approved or that would have been devastating.", "My favorite idea so far!", "Walken down the aisle with more cowbells.", "NTA. It's a very Mamma Mia situation. I'd say you should dredge up as many exes as you can (who you like and feel comfortable with) and get them to walk you down the aisle.", "My mom did this stuff and honestly I can see how you would react this way. I also lived with a lot of relatives/strangers in the form of my mother\u2019s boyfriends\u2026and I developed RAD (reactive attachment disorder). I had to go to some serious cognitive behavioral therapists that cost $$$ to help me fix it. I was very detached from relationships and emotions in general.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA. I had to cut my mother out of my life due to her constant guilt trips that are like this. It might hurt but it might be worth it to consider.", "Your life, your wedding, your choice. Do what you feel is right for you. No one should be pressuring you to choose who your  attendants at your wedding or who\u2019ll walk you down the aisle. Be honest with her. It's not going to happen and you aren't talking about it again.", "NTA the best part about my mom and her boyfriend is they don\u2019t pretend he\u2019s a big part of my life. We\u2019re polite to each other, he\u2019s kind to me when I\u2019m around. He\u2019s a decent guy. I can\u2019t say I particularly like him, he\u2019s not someone I would personally choose to spend time with, but I don\u2019t dislike him either and we\u2019re both cool with that. Your mom is the AH for trying to pretend the past doesn\u2019t matter and potentially the husband is too for not calling her out on it", "NTA, she can reasonably expect you to be civil to her husband, She can even expect you to invite him to the wedding alongside her, but she absolutely can not expect you to give him a role in the wedding Party that doesn't match how you feel about him, because it's YOUR wedding.", "NTA\n\nYou mom doesn't get to decide who you form emotional attachments to. She doesn't get to decide who you are friends with, or who walks you down the aisle. \n\nThe man she married is her husband, and that's it. A marriage certificate doesn't magically create a family.\n\nShe also doesn't have to understand your feelings. You've expressed yourself, she didn't want to hear it, and it's not your responsibility to make her. Set your boundaries, stick to them, and let her reactions be her own.", "NTA. My mom dated a few guys as well, but she never pressured me to accept them as \u201cmy new dad\u201d. That\u2019s just so weird. She\u2019s now married to my current stepdad, and I feel the same way about him that you feel about yours. Her trying to force a relationship between you and your stepdad will not work, and I think she\u2019s about to learn that.", "NTA for all the reasons you listed in your post. Congratulations on your upcoming marriage.", "NTA", "NTA. My mom's boyfriends came and went also. My step dad is a great guy, but it still took me a few years to warm up to him, over 10 years to accept that he was here to stay, and a few years after that to accept him as a parent. You might grow to like her husband and you might not, but that will happen when/if it happens.", "NTA, absolutely no one but you yourself can really decide what you feel. Also you\u2019ve been desensitized it sounds like, honestly she needs to accept that. She\u2019s expecting too much out of you", "NTA, she is an example of how not to do it. You don\u2019t just introduce a bf as a \u2018new daddy\u2019 ffs!", ">She argued that I was being SO unfair to her and had no idea how hard being a single parent is.\n\nEver notice that frequently when someone, like your mother, cries about unfairness they just mean you aren't catering to them enough? Interesting, isn't it.\n\nNTA, because the whole, \"it's hard being a single parent\" blather is undercut by the fact that the world isn't a virtual reality for which single parents are the only players. You were as much affected by being raised by a single mother as she was in the being. It's ridiculous for her to hide behind that.", "NTA. And a kid isn\u2019t obligated to be fully aware of how difficult single parenting is.", "NTA.\n\nI have friends tht have babies and who are going through the dating phase. I tell them while you are walking this path of finding love, remember your a mother/father now and your babies walk that path with you.\n\nNTA OP", "**Your mother is VERY lucky you are in contact with her at all.**\n\n**Have a joyous wedding.**\n\n**NTA.**", "This one hits hard as I was that kid and my mum and tried to think about my rejection of step dads a lot, NTA big time, they do it to themselves, bs on the single parent line, it's not difficult to only introduce your kid after years of dating and serious commitment and not use them as a prop.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice.  Don't let her guilt you.", "NTA. I'm sorry your mom failed you, but you seem to have done a brilliant job of raising yourself.", "Nta I have a bias because both my parents did the same thing but whenever my parents brought around the 10th million significant other I had no feelings for them. I never hated the people they dated but they didn\u2019t raise me and I knew most of them would go away after a few weeks or months. If she really wanted you to have a good relationship with her husband than she would have married someone that made both of you happy not just her. I also have a female friend who married a guy with kids they waited several months for her to meet the kids. Even when they met she was just a \u201cfriend\u201d. Know they are married and the kids love her as step mom. Just a heart warming story at the end if the rest made you sad.", "NTA.", "NTA. As someone who had a similar experience with my own mother while growing up, I can relate to your struggle and believe that you should choose whoever mattered the most in your life. It's your special day, not your mom's you did well on calling out on her bs.", "NTA\n\nYour mom can't make you like her husband. You have every right to feel the way you do.", "NTA \n\nWow! This is why most human beings wait a few months before introducing a partner to kids. It is super confusing for kids. I am so sorry that happened to you!\n\nI am glad you can set healthy boundaries like this and articulate that you don\u2019t see him as a father. Sounds like you are much healthier mentally than your mother. \n\nHave whoever you like walk you down the aisle or alternatively, walk yourself down the aisle as a strong independent woman who is owned by no one. \n\nGood luck", "NTA. You're right. Your mother cannot control your feelings or your attachments. \n\nIt doesn't matter how hard her life as a single mom was/is. That's not the issue and no one is denying that experience.\n\nAs well, your relationship to any of her boyfriends has little to do with her. She may have introduced you, but from there the relationship becomes between you and that other person.\n\nOf course you'll like some more than others. Of course you'll prefer people you get on with better than her husband.\n\nHer love life is separate from your life and she might need a professional to help her figure that out.", "NTA", "I blame Hallmark movies", "Being a single parent IS hard, and She apparently did okay at raising you, therefore she absolutely deserves to be acknowledged and have a mother-of-the-bride role, but her husband shouldn't have anything to do with that, and getting to dictate who gets to lead you down the aisle is not part of the mother-of-the-bride role in any Tradition I have ever heard of.", "Love how you phrased it! NTA", "Oof, yeah. Creeps prey on single mothers. Would you say you felt like it was more that she had to have a man more than it being about you having a father? Because it sounds like what she wanted came at the expense of you.", "NTA and this is a consequence of her actions and also why a single parent shouldn't introduce so many new boyfriends/girlfriends to their kids. No one family, friends or kids wants to see the carousel.", "NTA - Your mom needs therapy.  It's not appropriate to introduce kids and get them attached super early into dating,  it's not ok for her to expect you to perform in a way that makes her \"look good\" to potential partners.  She's just pity paying herself and lacking accountability to her misteps as a parent", "NTA\n\nLet's ignore your shitty childhood for a second. He came into your life when you were 15. It would be normal to never see a stepparent that arrived when youre that old as a real parent anyway", "While you can tell her you understand how being a single parent is hard, she needs to understand how being constantly introduced to a rollodex of guys as potential step-father is super hard as well. NTA.", "NTA, she failed as a mother in this respect, you don't introduce your children to whom you are dating so quickly, precisely because of how it affected you.", "You know damn well you aren\u2019t the asshole bruh", "Nope NTA.", "NTA  I never understand how single parents expect their feelings about new partners should just somehow instantly trickle down to their kids.  Maybe feelings will develop over time, but not right away (if ever).  I totally get turning off your feelings after being burned so many times.  You mom needs to get realistic about her life choices and respect you feelings.", "NTA, be done with the egomaniac.  She doesn't care about you as a person, she cares about you as Leverage and as a Showroom Piece.  This is abundantly clear in everything you've described.  Family is an Honorary Title it is Earned and Held by those who Love, Care, and RESPECT you.  It has nothing to do with blood, paperwork, dna or any of the various other lists people will claim.", "Exactly. NTA.", "[removed]", "Very much so on the \"at best\" aspect.  Honestly I'd put even odds on she wanted to leverage OP as a guilt trip if the guys spoke of breaking up.  \"But \\[OP\\] will be so sad if you leave, he already calls you dad...\"", "[Bot](https://old.reddit.com/user/RefrigeratorAlon) stole [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zin7bo/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_has_to_accept_that/izrsve6/)", "Gandalf the White or Gandalf the Grey?
