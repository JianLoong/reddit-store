I'm assuming you don't have kids, but assuming that is indeed true, it is bananas to me that a grown woman - even one who struggles with mornings in general - would need her spouse to get up help her get ready. There are a plethora of things she could be doing to help herself and it leaves the question for me of 'how would she handle this if she wasn't married?'. Maybe there are a few things she could do in the evenings, with or without your involvement, to make the mornings easier (like ironing clothes or setting the coffee to  brew on a timer) but anything you do would just be to be a kind, supportive partner, it's not your ACTUAL responsibility nor something you should be committed to doing day in and day out.", "Info:  Why doesn't she iron her clothes the night before?", "NTA  Your wife is an adult and fully capable of getting herself off to work.  Coffee pots are preprogramable and so it can be made the night before.  Clothes can also be ironed the night before or on weekends.", "I am in your wife's situation. The idea of making my partner (who is on a different work-time schedule to me) get up early just to 'help' me adult is ludicrous. In fact, it's a point of pride if I can leave the house without having disturbed them (and they pride themselves on the same for their work times.)\n\nNTA. You get up early to let the dog out for piss or to get toddlers to daycare or kids off to school. Your grown-ass wife can get herself to work like every other independent and functioning adult in the world can.", "NTA - She is an adult and can plan her mornings accordingly. It is great that you have helped her in the past! Maybe suggest that she prep the night before. Examples would be to prep the coffee so all she has to do in the morning is start it, she could also iron her clothes the night before. Help suggest tasks that will make her morning easier for her.", "NTA completely unreasonable, you are her partner not parent. If she had a disability, or was pregnant, or it was about helping kids if yall have some, I would get it, but assuming none of these are the case it is unreasonable. I would ask her why she thinks you should help her, I am honestly curious why now.", "\"..or ironing her clothes\"  \n\n\nOk this is nuts IMO. I have NEVER ironed my wives clothes for work or her iron mine. Why not do it the evening before? The same with the coffee? Have it ready so all she has to do is turn it on to brew....? Sounds like poor planning on her part, NTA.", "She is an adult woman and needs \"help\" getting ready every day? That's odd.\n\nNTA for wanting to sleep in because she should be able to get ready on her own.\n\nBut if she just loves you and wants your company in the morning, then go to bed a little earlier and spend some time together in the morning by waking up with her. That's good for your marriage.", "NTA, an adult should be able to get themself ready for work.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your responsibility to get up early to help her get ready as if she were a child, she should learn to manage her time and organize herself.  \nIf it makes you happy to make her a cup of coffee, why not, but what she's asking for is too much.", "NTA\n\nTell her to get her stuff prepared the night before.", "NTA. She can iron her clothes the night before, can get a programmable coffee maker that she can set the night before, ALL of this could be done the night before.   \n\n\nYou're not her parent and she's not a child, though she's acting like one over this.", "NTA. Wouldn\u2019t she expect her students to prepare to be ready for their school day??", "Info: kids? Other life stressors? What\u2019s going on here that a grown woman can\u2019t get up and get herself ready for work on time?", "NTA and unless there is some reason you're not sharing that your wife is unable to care for herself, her demand is crazy. She needs to plan better and maybe iron her clothes the night before. And maybe invest in an automatic coffee maker.", "NTA - Assuming she has a functioning body and a working brain then yes this is an unreasonable request. No reason she can't do this and no reason she can't get stuff ready the night before.", "NTA, I will say that I do make my wife breakfast everyday to help her get ready for work. But I just retired and after 30 years of waking at 4am to go to work, getting up at 6 am feels like sleeping in to me.", "She's your wife, not a toddler.  Iron the clothes the night before if you want to help.  And if she really can't make her own coffee buy one of those machines with a timer.\n\nNTA for wanting that extra 90 minutes of sleep.", "NTA on the assumption you are childless. You are not responsible for helping your wife get ready for work, she's an adult. If she wants clothes ironed she can do it the night before.\n\nBeing a teacher is a thankless job with long hours. That said, that was her choice of career, not yours, and while you should 100% support her in it, there are limits to where that support extends and I think this is beyond what should be considered reasonable.", "NTA. She sounds stressed and is unloading on you instead of communicating.", "NTA, get a coffee maker with a timer and the rest is on her. \n\nIt is nice to have your partner help, to feel cared for, potentially spend time with each other in the morning before the day and all that jazz. However, she\u2019s an adult who should be more than capable of doing her own ironing and coffee making. It\u2019s one thing if you guys sit down for breakfast to spend time with each other, it\u2019s another if she just wants you to do things for her and walk out the door.", "Make sure you change her diaper and get her a fresh bottle of milk. What a joke, adults should be able to get themselves ready in the morning. NTA", "NTA. If the situation was reversed, would she get up early to help you?", "Why do you need to wake up early to help her make coffee and iron her clothes? She an adult. She can wake up 15 minutes earlier herself and make her own coffee and iron her own clothes.\nIt\u2019s totally unreasonable to make you get up 1.5 hours earlier to help her. \nIf you want to help her anyway you could iron her clothes the day before but waking up earlier in the morning seems pointless. \n\nOBS. If you had said the same thing, but that you also had kids that she got ready for school etc. My answer would\u2019ve been different, but since it\u2019s just the two of you, she should be able to take care of herself.", "NTA does she allow her students to expect that kind of \u201chelp\u201d or does she tell them the real world won\u2019t care and they have to do it on their own?\nAlso, this is assuming she\u2019s not getting kids ready too.  You should be up participating in that if you do", "NTA. \n\nSorry, are you her husband or her father/carer? The absolute audacity. I\u2019d laugh in my partners face and tell her to go home to mama if he needs me to put the kettle on for him before work. Worrying she is a teacher, those who are meant to teach the future of our society about independence and becoming a grown up\u2026..", "NTA\n\nShe's 30. It's HER job that she chose to do. It's HER duty as an adult with responsibilities to plan for them.\n\nI am not a morning person at all. If I have to get up early for my own stuff, sure, I'll do it. But no way that I am going to get up that early to help someone else get out of bed and start the day.\n\nNTA!", "NTA she is not a child needing help to get ready. \nI am the one waking up before everybody else in the house, and that our alone having coffee by myself it\u2019s the best!!!", "NTA", "Iron the night before. Have coffee ready to go or get one with timer and have already brewed when awaking.", "The ONLY situation where you could be wrong on this is if you said the night before, \u201cI will get up and make you coffee\u201d and then didn\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t make more time once you\u2019ve already slept in based on the promise of your SO. But I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. NTA.", "NTA. Your wife is a big girl and its time for her to get organised. Either she irons her clothes at the weekend for the week  or put them out to an ironing service.

Some days I wake up early, and in those cases (like you), I'll pack his lunch and help get things together for his day \n\nBut if I'm sleeping? I get a kiss on the head and he handles his own stuff like the adult man he is.

My husband slept. NTA she can learn to make cold brew. It\u2019s delicious and it wakes you up better anyway.", "Maybe she has mistaken you for her mama. \n\nI dont think you are unreasonable at all. Maybe she should manage her own time better.", "I kept reading this waiting to find out you had kids\u2026well I guess you have one.", "It\u2019s a very unreasonable request. Ask her if she wants you to treat her like a child for everything in life. Also, does she tell her students to wait until the last minute to prepare for class.\n\nThe best you can do is remind her the night before to get her stuff done. It would be nice if you occasionally prep & set the coffee timer or just buy her a Keurig.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Is she a toddler? No? Then she doesn't need help getting ready? Maybe make her a coffee occasionally (if you want to) but why can't she iron her clothes herself the night before?", "NTA.\n\nYou're her husband not her butler.", "NTA - Your her partner not her parent. WTF? She's a grown ass woman. She can get ready by herself.", "YTA.... My wife needs to be at work at 7:30 a.m.  I have the alarm set for her at 6, get her up on the 3rd snooze, get her breakfast and coffee ready for her while she's in the shower and have her lunch packed for the day.

Consider though, that her getting up early and leaving while you are still asleep, can be lonely, if she wishes for connection? So, maybe I am reaching here, but is it possible she doesn't NEED you but really just WANTS some communal \"in this together\" type mornings with you?

Maybe she feels particularly lonely in the mornings. Maybe she dreads going to work and it helps to have you there to say goodbye and wish her a good day.

I could technically wait until 7:30 am to leave the house. However, I CHOOSE to get up early with him. We get up anytime between 3:30 and 4:30. He starts getting ready and I go start the coffee. Then I feed the cats breakfast and scoop litter boxes, see if the trash is ready to go (if so, I remove the bag and stick in front of the door). We normally finish up about the same time and the coffee is ready then. We sit down and have a cup of coffee (or a few cups) together while we check youtube, watch some news or something. When he leaves (taking the trash with him), I either do some stuff around the house, or occasionally will go and lay back down for an hour or so if I've had trouble sleeping or don't feel the best. It just starts my day out on a good note to spend a little quality time together. But there is never any DEMAND that I do anything for him. I would probably still get up and feed the cats or else they would come and torment me, but if I felt like his 'servant' or he just got his coffee and left, that's all I would do. He would be making his own coffee.
