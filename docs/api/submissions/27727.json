I'm assuming you don't have kids, but assuming that is indeed true, it is bananas to me that a grown woman - even one who struggles with mornings in general - would need her spouse to get up help her get ready. There are a plethora of things she could be doing to help herself and it leaves the question for me of 'how would she handle this if she wasn't married?'. Maybe there are a few things she could do in the evenings, with or without your involvement, to make the mornings easier (like ironing clothes or setting the coffee to  brew on a timer) but anything you do would just be to be a kind, supportive partner, it's not your ACTUAL responsibility nor something you should be committed to doing day in and day out.", "Info:  Why doesn't she iron her clothes the night before?", "NTA  Your wife is an adult and fully capable of getting herself off to work.  Coffee pots are preprogramable and so it can be made the night before.  Clothes can also be ironed the night before or on weekends.", "I am in your wife's situation. The idea of making my partner (who is on a different work-time schedule to me) get up early just to 'help' me adult is ludicrous. In fact, it's a point of pride if I can leave the house without having disturbed them (and they pride themselves on the same for their work times.)\n\nNTA. You get up early to let the dog out for a piss or to get toddlers to daycare or kids off to school. Your grown-ass wife can get herself to work like every other independent and functioning adult in the world can.", "NTA - She is an adult and can plan her mornings accordingly. It is great that you have helped her in the past! Maybe suggest that she prep the night before. Examples would be to prep the coffee so all she has to do in the morning is start it, she could also iron her clothes the night before. Help suggest tasks that will make her morning easier for her.", "NTA completely unreasonable, you are her partner not parent. If she had a disability, or was pregnant, or it was about helping kids if yall have some, I would get it, but assuming none of these are the case it is unreasonable. I would ask her why she thinks you should help her, I am honestly curious why now.", "\"..or ironing her clothes\"  \n\n\nOk this is nuts IMO. I have NEVER ironed my wives clothes for work or her iron mine. Why not do it the evening before? The same with the coffee? Have it ready so all she has to do is turn it on to brew....?

That's odd.\n\nNTA for wanting to sleep in because she should be able to get ready on her own.\n\nBut if she just loves you and wants your company in the morning, then go to bed a little earlier and spend some time together in the morning by waking up with her.

We normally finish up about the same time and the coffee is ready then. We sit down and have a cup of coffee (or a few cups) together while we check youtube, watch some news or something. When he leaves (taking the trash with him), I either do some stuff around the house, or occasionally will go and lay back down for an hour or so if I've had trouble sleeping or don't feel the best. It just starts my day out on a good note to spend a little quality time together. But there is never any DEMAND that I do anything for him.

I had a similar situation with my wife.  I had taken a couple weeks of vacation after my company said they would no longer be buying out our vacation time and roll it over, however it would always cap out at 4 weeks.  This was their piss poor attempt at avoiding state laws regarding vacation time and \u201csaving money\u201d which is code for, we are fucking you over to pad our bonuses again.  \n\nAnyway, so instead of getting up early like I would normally do I just turned off all of my alarms and planned on sleeping in every day.  The first morning I was woken up, and TOLD not asked to help her get ready and make her coffee while she was in the shower.  \nI was upset but didn\u2019t say anything at the time.  I just did as I was told.  She seemed happy when it was time to leave.  She gave me a big hug and kiss as she was walking out the door.  I found it odd how her mood changed when it was time to leave.   The next morning the same thing happened and this time I stopped her and asked if everything was ok but made it clear I was expecting an answer about why she insisted I get up and help her as it\u2019s never been like this.  She sat on the edge of the bed and started softly sobbing.  She was upset, not with but her work as they denied her time off.  She wanted to spend time with as we usually work so much we hardly have time for each other.  She\u2019d never actually taken any time off while she worked for them and couldn\u2019t understand why they would deny her after being at work, on time every she was scheduled for 6 years.  She went on to say that since she had to work while I was off, that this was a chance for us to spend more time together.  So, knowing that she was craving more time together I started getting up with her for the remainder of my staycation.  I even started slicing things up the following day by setting the coffee timer to go off while she was showering and joining her.  We found out quickly how hot morning shower sex is and made it a part of our morning routine.  We always made sure not to snooze our alarms too much after discovering that so we could have plenty of time together.  It didn\u2019t always lead to sex but it was always intimate no matter what.  \n\nSo after telling you story of me and my late wife, I leave you with this.  Communicate with her, talk it out.  You never know when it\u2019ll be the last time you see her so don\u2019t let petty stuff like this get between your love for each other.  I lost my wife to Covid in just a few short days.

It's amazing I can keep myself alive, not starving and hydrated.. let alone have a consistent routine or do chores that feel like I'm dragging a bowling ball on each foot (it really does feel physically HEAVY, our brains are dying of thirst for dopamine).  It's extremely hard to just ignore it, it'd be like trying to not scream or react when you burn yourself.\n\nI thought of an analogy that could maybe help people understand how it actually feels:  Normal brains, and properly medicated/structure/routine ADHD brains are like playing a pinball machine with ONE ball.  ADHD unmedicated, or before/after meds are active (I only get 8 hours with high metabolism).. are like playing pinball with FORTY balls flying at once.  You can't focus on all of them, so it's much harder to score anything and tons balls get dropped. In high dopamine giving stuations (having fun, things we love, stimulating conversation).. we almost feel normal for a bit.  The minute responsibility/boring comes knocking the symptoms people give you shit for kick in.  \n\nThen the crippling shame/fear of screwing up again can overwhelm us into feeling frozen.. and we can't do hardly anything at all but hyperfocus on 1 thing that gives us a steady (but low) supply of dopamine - like your phone or tv.  To the outside, we look lazy, but we are seriously struggling and need help.  But just doing 'the things' for us that our brain revolts against (and enabling it) isn't healthy, but support/encouragement and medical help are.  The dopamine starved brain will seek the easiest way out of doing what doesnt give it more, if you arent self aware of it yet.. and it can look selfish.\n\nIt fucks with emotional regulation too, so harsh criticism and 'tough love' or yelling just makes it worse and drives us closer to becoming paralyzed.\n\nWe don't let physically disabled people just crawl on the floor and chastise them for being lazy and late, and expect them to not use a wheelchair.
