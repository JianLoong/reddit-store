Some can do it but many can\u2019t. Second, and more importantly, this guy chased his dream and you chased yours. You both put the work in that you deemed appropriate and you are both now reaping what has been sewn. He went for the quick easy dollar and you put in the time and hard work. I Would ordinarily say that as a consolation, you could offer him a job in the company, but with no equity and no officer position, but that would be a bad idea. He obviously resents you and he would resent you in that case as well. Sadly, you need to stand firm on this. You may lose some friends and have some relatives that are angry with you, but it\u2019s times like these that allow people to show their true colors and you can really find out who your friends are. If people cancel you for this, they aren\u2019t worth your time anyway. Good luck and I\u2019m sorry you are facing this. It sucks when family turns on you.", "Nta.
