Nta, if they aren't willing to donate large sums of cash to him, why would you be expected to do the same?", "NTA. First, it is very difficult to be in business with family. Some can do it but many can\u2019t. Second, and more importantly, this guy chased his dream and you chased yours. You both put the work in that you deemed appropriate and you are both now reaping what has been sewn. He went for the quick easy dollar and you put in the time and hard work. I Would ordinarily say that as a consolation, you could offer him a job in the company, but with no equity and no officer position, but that would be a bad idea. He obviously resents you and he would resent you in that case as well. Sadly, you need to stand firm on this. You may lose some friends and have some relatives that are angry with you, but it\u2019s times like these that allow people to show their true colors and you can really find out who your friends are. If people cancel you for this, they aren\u2019t worth your time anyway. Good luck and I\u2019m sorry you are facing this. It sucks when family turns on you.", "Nta. You built a company hecwas not interested in joining until.the money started rolling in. Tell him the business is worth x about of dollars and if he wants to get in he has to pay. Nope do not let him join your company!", "OP should not employee him. Mixing family with business is not a good idea and he has lost 55K i would state his financial decision making is shit.", "I really don't think this would be a good idea.

He declined. The saying, \"If you're not there for me at my worst you don't deserve to be here at my best,\" was never more true than here. I'd tell the family that you offered it to him and he wasn't interested, so you moved on. If they continue, you may need to go LC with them.\n\nCongratulations on your big contract! Hard work pays off!", "Just to review. \n- Your brother lacks the critical thinking skills to recognize his failure as a day trader for over a year.  \n- He only stopped day trading when he ran out of money.  \n- He has no money to purchase equity and he did no work to earn an equity stake. \n- He cries to his mommy when he isn\u2019t given things he didn\u2019t earn. \n\nWhat in that list of behaviors makes you think he\u2019d be an asset to your business?

When you were struggling, GRINDING, day and night with your friend he wanted no parts of your business. He's only interested in fast money, and a quick come up.\n\nYou have a great thing going with your partner, keep it that way.  Your brother will turn your business upside down. If it's one thing I learned was to never do business with family, it ALWAYS goes left. He will come in and try to dominate everything. He will try to undermine your partner, simply because he's your \"brother.\"\n\nI might be looking too deeply into things, but I think it's best to go low contact with everyone for a while, let things blowover. It's hard, but I would suggest that you don't pay attention to familial pressures.", "NTA.

End of. NTA", "NTA  First off, congrats on the contract! Second, if I were you, I'd offer him an entry level position (if such a thing exists), but nothing beyond that.  I definitely wouldn't want him any more involved than that.  Finally, I'd advise you to keep the finances on the down low. Big numbers tend to attract people's attention.", "He didn't plant the fruit tree, he can't pick the fruit.", "NTA. Tell him that when you decide to hire employees he can go to the head of the line. But just giving him an ownership of the company? No. The company has value now that it didnt have then. And Half is owned by your partner. You cant give away his equity. And your not about to become a minority owner. \nYou could offer to let him buy in but we all know that is not on the table. He traded his hard work for a shot at quick money and missed out. He just needs to grin and bear it.", "NTA. You do not own this company alone. You have a partner. It is not your decision alone to expand payroll. You have no right to add in a partner. This may not be the time to add on employees. You're still growing. Just starting to turn the corner. Does your brother expect to drop into a role as a full partner? I would never, ever give up equity. At best, one day, brother might be able to come on as an employee, but not now.", "NTA\n\nIf they have ever complained about \u201cthe bosses family member\u201d being raised up in the company undeservedly, inform them that they are hypocrites who support nepotism.", "Stop telling any family about your business dealings. Mom and brother are leeches.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give him equity. If anything, you could hire him with an opportunity to buy in at some point.  Mixing family and business can go south quick, especially when mom gets an opinion on internal affairs. He made his choice.", "Hell no. The best you coul do is hire him as an employee if you need workforce that is.", "Don't do it. He lost 55K+ in a year. You'll e screwed.", "You pick the person who did the work.  That was not the brother.\n\nNta, but family will continue to guilt you as long as they can get away with it.  \n\nYou need to set boundaries with consequences.", "NTA.  Well I guess you could give him a job IF you need extra people, but it would be a salary NOT a piece of the company pie.  Still, I wouldn't specifically create a job for him if you don't need one.", "NTA. You plowed the field, planted the crop and harvested the results of your labor.

It's not your fault he lost 55k. (Edit - hadn't finished & hit enter.)", "Nta. Just say you don't want to mix business with family.", "NTA and not fair to your partner who\u2019s worked his ass off as well. Can you just bring him in for a trial period as an employee and let him prove himself? If he ends up being valuable to the company and brings in income on a regular basis then you and your partner can weigh pros/cons. Have a discussion about this and if he\u2019s not willing to do it on your terms you certainly don\u2019t want him as a partner. Congratulations on your success!", "NTA. \n\nWait, he didn't seriously ask you for equity, did he? What is he proposing?\n\nWas he going to break you off a % of what he made daytrading, if he had been successful? Honestly, I would questioj the judgment and work ethic of anyone who just lost their entire nut daytrading. Personally, I try to avoid working w people w bad judgment.", "NTA\n\nYou can say that his work ethic is not a match for your company's policies.\n\nYou can tell other people, like your mom, that this is a money-making endeavor, not a situation for gambling.\n\nETA: He has already declined working with you. You can always say that he has not filled out an employment application.", "NTA. I feel like your Mom just wants her son to succeed, but perhaps you and your friend should put some requirements on the joining of the business that you can use to further expand the team - must have track record of proven experience in x field for 1+ years. Ya know, as you've now done the hard part and are more established, therefore you need a more polished team with the experience that you and your friend have now accrued. (This also encourages Bro to get a job, perhaps in the same field, and not just try to lean on you.) \n\nThe petty in me says just buy him and your mom copies fo the children's book, The Little Red Hen, with a posting for a job fair or other help wanted opportunity printed out in his and call it a day.", "He lost even more than that. He is in debt now. 55k were only his savings. He clearly wasn't responsible enough to stop it when he failed. If op would let him be part of the business it is even possible that his debtors would want their share.", "Or other people's assets on the whole, tbh.

I wasn't even thinking that you'd literally give him a piece of your company until I got to the last part of your paragraph.", "NTA.  Your mom and the 'few family members' who are telling you your business can start a company and hire him.", "You offered your brother the opportunity to join you before turning to your friend. He is the one who turned you down. He screwed up, it's not on you to bail him out. You guys put in all the blood, sweat and tears and NOW he wants you to just take him in?? No way in hell!!   \nAsk anyone who has something to say if they would like to put up the cash for him to buy in since you are now an established enterprise.   \nNTA. Your brother is a huge AH for a variety of reasons.", "Your brother has clearly demonstrated poor judgement, lack of resolve or follow through, reckleness with finances. Honestly even without all that getting into business with family is risky. NTA", "NTA.  Business is business, family is family.  Keep the two apart.", "NTA.  You and your partner started this, worked and grew it.  He did nothing, like you said he wants in for nothing.  He lost 55k in one year, I would highly question his business acumen.  Tell your mom and the relatives that are giving you a hard time to pool their money and start their own business.  You owe him nothing.  A year ago you offer him to join you, he scoffed at your offer.", "Nope stick to your choice!", "NTA your partner earned his spot in the company. Y.wbta if you compromised your company by putting him into a spot he hasnt earned.", "Don't mix business with family, they may screw you over and it sounds like your brother will clear you out. OP be strong and tell your mom snd family to stop interfering. NTA"]}
