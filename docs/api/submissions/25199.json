He's loving and supportive, he has a fantastic personality, among many other fantastic qualities. Not to mention, he has been a super dad ever since our daughter was born. I am so thankful for him and love him completely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week, we had a Disney movie night. He and I were cuddled on the couch and our daughter was in her walker in front of us. My husband got up to refill my water, and as he was walking towards the kitchen, he lifted his leg up next to our baby, said \"drive-by.\" and farted in her direction.I died laughing, which got my husband to laugh, and in turn, our daughter started laughing, which made it even funnier. Unfortunately, I think the positive reinforcement of this opened a Pandora's box of baby-targetted-drive-by-farts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery day since, he has farted on her. He'll walk wherever she is, lift up his leg, say \"drive by\", and fart. Some instances when he has decided to bomb the baby: While she was getting ready to nap. While she was playing with her toys. When we were reading a children's book. Even during bath time. What was initially funny started to get old pretty quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe final straw was a few nights ago. He had made a nice dinner for us and a new meal for the baby to try. We had her in her high chair near the dining table. We are in the process of introducing her to new foods and that night was bananas.The amount of time it took for my husband and I to finish eating was the same amount of time for our daughter to decide she was ready to try the new food. While I was coaxing her into taking a bite, my husband offered to take our dishes to the sink, but he also had a grin on his face. In my mind, I'm thinking, there's no fucking way. But lo and behold, he walks near our baby, lifts his leg, and rips out a loud, almost cartoonish sounding fart so loud it could've shattered a wine glass directly onto our baby. She began cackling until the smell hit her, she began gagging and spit up the banana onto herself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband was cracking up, but stopped when he realized I wasn't. He immediately tried to calm himself and apologize, but he said \"C'mon, you gotta admit that was fucking hilarious!\". I was wiping the spit up banana off our our daughter and snapped a little and said \"She's probably going to hate bananas forever because of this. What were you thinking?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe stopped laughing and got quiet for a moment before kneeling down and helping me clean her up. He apologized. I was annoyed but didn't think much of it until later when we were in bed and he asked me if I thought he was too immature. I told him it didn't bother me, but that tonight just wasn't as funny as he has hoped. He kept apologizing to me and said he'd be better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel really bad. I apologized myself the next morning for getting frustrated with him, and he told me I didn't have to, but I hate seeing the man I love beat himself up over something so silly. So AITA for how I reacted? I don't think he is TA at all.", "created_utc": 1692650495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xjfml/aita_for_how_i_handled_my_husband_driveby_farting/", "score": 735, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The whole purposely passing gas near her is just immature and gross.\nI am glad you put your foot down to stop this.

YES! But at the end of the day you both came to the conclusion that it isn't a good thing to get in the habit of. No one is perfect!!

And she played more practical jokes on me than anybody when we were kids.\n\nI also never said the baby should just \u201c sit and take it\u201d which is kind of a weird way to phrase that considering that the baby is quite literally giggling at the thing happening, but OK.", "The amount of people losing their minds over farts and calling them literally too immature to be parents is absolutely hilarious. There are millions of far worse, actually abusive parents and people in here would think farting in the same room as your kid is the same as hitting them. It\u2019s so laughable it\u2019s hilarious", "OP, it's a running gag in my house that my 7 year old and I give each other our burps and farts. We may sometimes hurry to the other. If we don't quite make it, we have also been known to \"catch\" them and throw them on one another. It's harmless fun and we only do it with each other, I made sure of that part lol. My child knows it's super odd and only \"home behavior\" lmao. The pearls some of these folks are clutching, maybe my game will make you feel better lol. Your family sounds fun", "Lmao", "Good for y'all! I'm 47, my husband is 50, and my sister is 43, and let me tell u, farts are still a thing around here. Wish I could tell u some of those stories. You and your husband and baby sound delightfully happy. Keep up the good work!", "Also, jokes get old. Time for him to learn so he can model that for a soon to be budding comedian.

Once you do a joke a few times let it go.", "I agree with you but I think it's sad that you need to teach context to a 28-year-old supposedly grown man. People need to learn that there's a time and place for everything. I'm sorry but I feel like he should have learned this already.

I always hated it when adults farted on or near me as a kid. It's gross and disrespectful. I get that the baby could be amused by the noise, but farting really close to anyone is awful. I'm not a prude, I swear...I think belching is funny most of the time, but not in anyone's face.

Holy hell", "For the record all of the people who are giving you shit are ridiculous. I thought this whole post was hilarious and harmless. But then again my husband and I fart on each other all the time. But you know what? That means that when something is actually wrong, we can talk about it and be vulnerable about it without having to be stick-up-our-asses prudes about it.

I spend my days eating as much protein as possible because the smell surrounding me drives people away, but I only know to lure em back through a new funny sounding fart. It\u2019s not easy, but I struggle along.", "No, farting is classic dad behaviour.\n\nBeing serious all the time is just as damaging as taking nothing seriously.\n\nIf you can't laugh at a fart with your son, what is the point of even living?

They have an immature sense of humor, that's it.", "My husband and I fart whenever we feel like it. Never on each other, and only in our own home without company.\n\nOur 9 year old follows suit. She knows when it's okay and when it isn't. She knows when it's an indicator she needs to go to the bathroom. \n\nWe always laugh. Farting is funny. They aren't too immature to be parents, they're people that are comfortable in all ways with each other that are figuring out how to parent.", "Have you seen the world around us lately?\n\nWatch the news? See all the bad things happening and wonder what the future holds? For you?

Proof I'd be a terrible parent. \n\nThere seem to be a lot of fart-offended people in this thread", "I've had a similar, gentle, conversation with my kid, but about conversation starters/ice breaker type things. It's fine to do it a couple times with a person, but after that, you need to think up new material. \n\nExample- *Randomly* \"I still don't understand why my sheet comes off while I'm asleep.\" After I've already explained to her twice that she moves in her sleep and I can tell by her smile that she's actually just trying to start a conversation and spat out the first thing her brain thought of that ended in us having a conversation. It just happened to be a rerun of something that we've already discussed multiple times with no new bits to add to it. \n\nI don't want to mess up her confidence, so I gently remind her that we've already talked about it and did she have anything new to add or was she just looking to have a chat? When she says the latter, I remind her that it's better to spend a couple extra minutes thinking of something to talk about rather than use something we've already talked all the way through. \n\nThen I help her think of something new, like animal facts, or what she dreamed about, or what her current favorite outfit is.", "This is the way", "One of the late night hosts (my first thought was Conan, but maybe not) commented whenever he'd do a third joke on any given topic in his monologue \"That's three.\" And then he'd move on.
