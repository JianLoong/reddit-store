He's loving and supportive, he has a fantastic personality, among many other fantastic qualities. Not to mention, he has been a super dad ever since our daughter was born. I am so thankful for him and love him completely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast week, we had a Disney movie night. He and I were cuddled on the couch and our daughter was in her walker in front of us. My husband got up to refill my water, and as he was walking towards the kitchen, he lifted his leg up next to our baby, said \"drive-by.\" and farted in her direction.I died laughing, which got my husband to laugh, and in turn, our daughter started laughing, which made it even funnier. Unfortunately, I think the positive reinforcement of this opened a Pandora's box of baby-targetted-drive-by-farts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEvery day since, he has farted on her. He'll walk wherever she is, lift up his leg, say \"drive by\", and fart. Some instances when he has decided to bomb the baby: While she was getting ready to nap. While she was playing with her toys. When we were reading a children's book. Even during bath time. What was initially funny started to get old pretty quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe final straw was a few nights ago. He had made a nice dinner for us and a new meal for the baby to try. We had her in her high chair near the dining table. We are in the process of introducing her to new foods and that night was bananas.The amount of time it took for my husband and I to finish eating was the same amount of time for our daughter to decide she was ready to try the new food. While I was coaxing her into taking a bite, my husband offered to take our dishes to the sink, but he also had a grin on his face. In my mind, I'm thinking, there's no fucking way. But lo and behold, he walks near our baby, lifts his leg, and rips out a loud, almost cartoonish sounding fart so loud it could've shattered a wine glass directly onto our baby. She began cackling until the smell hit her, she began gagging and spit up the banana onto herself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy husband was cracking up, but stopped when he realized I wasn't. He immediately tried to calm himself and apologize, but he said \"C'mon, you gotta admit that was fucking hilarious!\". I was wiping the spit up banana off our our daughter and snapped a little and said \"She's probably going to hate bananas forever because of this. What were you thinking?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe stopped laughing and got quiet for a moment before kneeling down and helping me clean her up. He apologized. I was annoyed but didn't think much of it until later when we were in bed and he asked me if I thought he was too immature. I told him it didn't bother me, but that tonight just wasn't as funny as he has hoped. He kept apologizing to me and said he'd be better.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel really bad. I apologized myself the next morning for getting frustrated with him, and he told me I didn't have to, but I hate seeing the man I love beat himself up over something so silly. So AITA for how I reacted? I don't think he is TA at all.", "created_utc": 1692650495, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xjfml/aita_for_how_i_handled_my_husband_driveby_farting/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get it, the accident the first time may have been funny or whatever. But after that, it wasn't funny.

The whole purposely passing gas near her is just immature and gross.\nI am glad you put your foot down to stop this.

YES! But at the end of the day you both came to the conclusion that it isn't a good thing to get in the habit of. No one is perfect!!

When you were having a casual movie night with the baby, a little bit of silly immaturity was fun for everybody! But during a more serious and stressful situation like trying to get the baby to acclimate to a new food or a new routine, it\u2019s maybe not the time for silly immaturity. \n\nMy dad was full of silliness as well, and I hope he and your baby can continue to have father-child silliness for the rest of their relationship, but there\u2019s a time and a place when the silliness needs to be put on hold.", "Seriously, with some of the stories you can read on here, this story was positively adorable.\n\nYou both handled it like adults and with love.\n\n10/10.", "You two sound amazing together, and like you're incredible parents.

As he wouldn't like it if you farted in his face when he was eating.\n\nThough saying that, you could potentially use the fact that she laughs at farts as a form of positive reinforcement in a more pleasant way. You could get a fart machine (so no noxious, toxic emissions) and press that and everyone laugh. Then, when you're trying to give her something new to eat, press the fart machine, so she laughs first. That way she's already feeling positive before trying the food. Then after her first mouthful, press it again so everyone laughs. That way hopefully her memory about the taste will be  positive, even if she initially isn't keen. So the next time you try her with it she'll remember it more positively. It might not work, but it's worth a try, and you'll get to hear her laughing lots.", "He made a bad call on a dumb joke.

I\u2019m not insinuating he stuck her nose between his bare cheeks, getting into someone\u2019s personal bubble is referred to as getting in their face. Babies also stand ass high.

We are all for farting in this house but not no drive bys etc when eating, thats gross", "I imagine he was probably so happy to find something fun to enjoy with the baby that he simply let it go a bit too far.

Yeah, probably! Would it be funny after a few more times? No! Just like my exact situation!\n\nMy husband and I already agreed that what he did was wrong and that he isn't going to do it again.

Our daughter is attached to his hip, and he's taken on a lot of the parenting duties even though he works full time. We might still be immature, but we do our best for our little girl.

I didn't raise my voice or anything, but I think my tone was definitely annoyed.", "But why is something funny the first time but then subsequently unacceptable? How would your husband know? Not that I\u2019m defending him, you all are fucked, but of all the times that week you watched him fart on your baby did you laugh and at which fart did it become gross? I imagine he had as hard a time understanding your line in the sand as I had reading this post", "I agree that it\u2019s not that serious. However, it was serious enough for you to write all of this out asking for advice and responding to everyone. Why talk for two hours about something if it\u2019s so unimportant it\u2019s not worth considering?\n\nI asked how many times will you conveniently lie to spare your husband\u2019s feelings when it concerns your child. I asked that because in your one example, that\u2019s what you did. And it would be silly to think that pattern of behavior BEGAN with farts. Or that you think it\u2019s not serious since you\u2019re a still here with all of us. \n\nConsider when your husband\u2019s feelings about how funny he is or his jokes or whether he\u2019s a great guy or a great dad are more important than your child. You certainly wouldn\u2019t be the first conflict-averse mom to choose her husband\u2019s feelings over her kid. Try to make this unimportant farting thing the last time you sacrifice your child\u2019s happiness for your husband\u2019s. Just a reminder: the farting he did regularly at your child on purpose was enough to gag up food.

They need you to help them reach maturity, not be their friend.\n\nThe area I grew up in went through a massive recession when I was a kid. The people who grew up fine were the ones with pragmatic parents who put their kids' well-being first.

It matters that you build some scaffolding for your kid. Literally: nothing else matters.\n\nI'm not saying this is going to scar your baby forever or whatever. But if some kid at their school was farting at them everyday, would you want them to set a boundary or no?

I would've talked to him about it the next day, anyways.\n\nMy husband and I have very open communication and this was not one of those moments where a small issue needed to be bigger.
