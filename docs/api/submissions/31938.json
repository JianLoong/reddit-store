{"id": 31938, "submission_id": "1865mhn", "title": "AITA for accusing my cousins of taking their grief out on me and telling them naming my kids is nothing to do with them?", "selftext": "I (31m) am the only surviving member of my family. When I was 5 I lost my mom and my 4 older siblings in an accident. I was then raised by my maternal grandparents. After the initial accident my family were told none of us had survived and so I was a surprise when the news reached them. My grandparents, aunts and uncles were all thrilled. But my cousins... eh. They were much closer to my siblings. They were similar ages to them. I was 6 years younger than my youngest sister and 8 years younger than my youngest cousin... I wasn't really \"in\" with my cousins. With my siblings? We were a tight unit. And they would often reject our cousins when they weren't interested in \"a baby tagging along\". So I think when I was the one who came home, not one of my siblings, I think my cousins hated me for it. We never got close. It was always weird.\n\nBut then a few weeks ago we were at my grandparents house for a celebration. It was my husband and me with our four kids. My cousins were all huddled together for a while and then started dropping comments to me about the choice to give my kids their own names and not honor my mom or siblings with their names. They asked me how I could claim to love and miss my family when I didn't think to honor them. Or how I could act like they meant the world to me when I don't want my kids to know about them via their names (because they know about them). I did my best to avoid them the rest of the celebration. Then a couple of weeks after that we were all together again for my aunt's retirement party. \n\nThe comments continued there and they told me they would have named their kids after my mom or siblings but their parents had suggested it should be reserved for me and left alone if I didn't because maybe it would be too painful. They told me I hogged my family just like I hogged my siblings back then. And I didn't even love them as much as they did.\n\nI became so frustrated that when we were all alone in a room together, because I followed them, I told them they should not be taking their grief out on me. I told them I never tried stopping them from using the names of my mom and siblings for their kids. They never said anything about wanting that to me until they decided to make all those bitter comments. I told them I was sorry they were grieving but I could not take responsibility for coming back and not my siblings. And that naming my kids has nothing to do with them so drop the comments about it showing a lack of love. I told them I was not going to be their emotional punching bag and did not deserve their grief being taken out on me.\n\nEver since then they have responded with a lot more anger saying I have no right to accuse them of that and they have every right to make an observation on my kids' names. It has become so tiring and I'm questioning if I was wrong to say all that I did.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701202817, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1865mhn/aita_for_accusing_my_cousins_of_taking_their/", "score": 4152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They resent my existence and abhor the fact that I was able to get into recovery and get a handle on my mental health. It's fucking weird", "Literally. All my cousins were older than me (except for two...one was a month older and one 3 years younger) I was never excluded.  Probably because grandpa would have lost his everloving shit,  and my prim Southern Auntie would have waved a wooden spoon and told us to be nice. (but we liked playing anyway lol)\n\nMight be time to loudly out them to grandma and say exactly what you typed here.", "Seriously, it's been 26 YEARS! I realize family grief is intense but come on, learn to move on a little! They told OP that they were 'hogging the family'? Holding a grudge that petty for that long is actual insanity.", "It's homophobia", "If OP doesn't want to go no contact I'd at the very least start dropping emotional dynamite in retaliation \n\n\"My siblings would hate to see how you're treating me.\"\n\n\"'So-and-so would be so disappointed to see you saying stuff like that.\"\n\n\"They would have loved my children's names, just like they loved me.\"", "True, BUT only if nothing else works. OP, his husband and children are the ones who most deserve to enjoy family gatherings with those not being shitty shitty shitty. The cousins need their shameful behavior to see the light of day. If they feel so fine about it, then they won't mind others in the family their chance to offer their opinion. It's up to OP of course of what he feels is best, but I so desire their behavior exposed for the absolute most insensitive, least empathetic response to loss and grief by family members I can remember hearing.", "I would have dropped a lot of F bombs too, then I would have left with my family.  How dare *they* act like their grief is more important than yours?  \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Well and very glad for OP\u2019s kids-  they didn\u2019t need a permit reminder of a tragic accident. \n\nI have a feeling that these cousins would fawn over the names and make it awkward if OP had used the names.  \n\nSome people are just gonna be rude no matter what you do.  Might as well be choose for you OP.  Nta", "I mean, OP lost their whole family. What if you were only able to have the one kid. How do you choose which family member\u2019s name to honor? It\u2019s just ridiculous.", "Unless you have the naming skills of Elon Musk, it's usually fine to just do what you want with your children names.", "Yes, this. That\u2019s a lot of weight of memory and grief to levy on a kid.", "My(ex) best friend asked me why I wasn't over my fiancee's death after two months.  That's why she's an ex-friend.", "AITA for yelling when my girlfriend kicked my old dog?", "It's difficult to believe that these are people who are now in their 40s acting like this. It's ridiculous.", "I would get a blow horn/air horn and blast it every time they started talking shit but that's just me. There's no reasoning with crazy/ stupid", "NTA and it doesn't sound like these people bring any love or light to your life, just negativity.  No reason to continue those relationships, we don't have long on this earth and it's a shame to waste any of it on people who are in life's minus column.", "Go NCUA with them. They are cruel and mean people. They aren\u2019t grieving, it has been decades. What they are is petty jerks who enjoy makinghyou feel bad.", "This is possible. When a traumatic event happens during childhood, to an extent you can get stuck there developmentally. \n\nBut you\u2019re definitely NTA and I hope they get the therapy they need", "That\u2019s not unusual. They were old enough for that traumatic event to have stuck to them in a way you were perhaps young enough to avoid. Still, if they wanted to name their kids after your family, they could have spoken to you about it.", "They sounded petty and evil even for teens, and they are still petty and evil adults. \nI hope you stay away from them.", "I was hated in my new school because my family bought the home formerly owned by the most popular kid in my grade. I was accused of \u201cpushing Nancy Kincaid out of her house\u201d which ruined grade school for me (damn bullies)", "Also if they were so close to your immediate family tell them your parents and siblings would be so disappointed in the way they\u2019ve bullied and harangued you over this. I know I would be.", "They're claiming they loved your siblings and parents more than you did. There's something seriously wrong with them, and I'd lead with that when you inform the rest of the family that you're cutting them off.", "Not only do I think they are complete Aholes, I can't imagine calling one of your children by your mothers name or a sibling. Maybe a middle name but not the name you'd use on a daily basis. We have to remember our past loved ones but not be constantly faced with that moment in time when you call your kids to dinner etc. that would be unhealthy.", "This is a great alternative solution.", "Honestly, I'm especially furious at the fact they claimed they loved Op's siblings more than them. What kind of psychos tell the only surviving family member that they loved their dead immediate family members more than they did?", "...Felony Meth.. oh, poor kid.", "[Meet baby Methamphetamine Rules. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/sep/19/can-you-name-your-baby-methamphetamine-rules-in-australia)", "Agreed. It's f'ckin weird! They need some serious help.", ">'How dare they, who still have their siblings and parents, tell you how to feel. How dare they talk about your family's names like they are just labels to be claimed and they weren't living, breathing people who are irreplaceable.'\n\n*applause*", "this!", "That was a brilliant piece of work.", "They appear to make sure none of the older generation was around. Op says the cousins were \"all in a room alone\"\n\nSo they probably know granny, and probably the aunts ans uncles, would lose their shit at the comments", "Right?? These people are all BY FAR older than OP. I have siblings and cousins younger than myself. I cannot fathom EVER treating my younger cousins,  for example, with the contempt these ppl treat their own cousin. I'd be thoroughly ashamed of myself. If my cousin lost their entire family as a kindergartener I'd be spending my whole life making sure they have surrogate siblings in my side of the family,  knowing that those siblings can never truly be replaced.", ">NCUA\n\nI know NC is No Contact, but what is UA?", "They were treating OP bad even before. They used to say they didn't want a baby tagging along. OP's siblings used to stand up for him and hang with him in those times. They were toxic before the trauma. I had cousins much older and much younger growing up, while there were age groups that naturally hung out, all were welcome to join in regardless of age. Cousins are supposed to be family.", "Total psychos.", "If I was OP, I would fastidiously ensure that I was never alone with them. Even if it meant rudely walking out in the middle of a conversation.", "Said his piece, and said it very eloquently! Agreed OP, you\u2019re not responsible for whatever their issues are, and you don\u2019t owe them any further contact.", "OP is a woman.", "OP is a man, they self identified as 31m at the beginning of the story", "because only women can have husbands apparently", "31m?", "True according to the classical definition of \u2018husband\u2019.", "According to the definition exclusively used by stupid idiot assholes maybe.", "Do gaslighting and bullying, and immaturity all come naturally to you or does your commentary here represent your rehearsal of them?", "You can\u2019t put those words together in that order and expect to make sense."]}
