There were about 20 people enjoying the pool, drinking and having a barbecue with my stuff. \nApparently they used a ladder to jump over the wall. The wall had a \"broken\" fence and will be replaced tomorrow. It's the only wall that faces the street. When they saw us, they started to get even more desperate that my brother had the ladder. \n\nThey tried to escape but we kind of protected the  wall.\n\nThe police had already been called, so we didn't want anyone to escape. Nothing happened to anyone to make it clear, they just tried to get past us to go to the lowest wall, but couldn't. \n\nThe police arrived. There were 7 children (6-13 yo), 12 adolescents (14-17 yo) and 1 adult (39 yo).\n\n Those responsible for the minors were called and this caused a mess, as they started to accuse us gor holding minors in my house when I am not a police authority.\n\n The police gave me the freedom to press charges or not, but I said I just wanted the value of the items consumed, pay for a cleaning lady and cleaning the pool. Yes, it would cost a high value, because the outside area was a mess and almost everything used in the fridge.\n\n The adults began to say that just scolding from the police would be enough and that I know how stupid young people can be and begged me not to charge that amount, as most of them were extremely poor. \n\nI stood by my decision, saying that they would have until today (Monday) to pay for my damage, otherwise I would press charges against everyone. Yes, I heard a lot of curses, but today I received the full amount. \n\nMy husband said that I was very harsh, because I paid out of my pocket anyway ( there was the party anyway) and that for us, there would be no difference that money, but for extremely poor families? Yes.\n\n I really don't think it's fair to have this expense, despite being able to pay without weighing on my pocket.

Maybe the cost they had to pay will help get their audacity in check.", "NTA\n\nHowever I wouldn't press charges or expect payment from the youngsters, they would have been influenced by the elder ones (especially the 6 year old) and for them a telling off by the police is likely enough\n\nThe adult is entirely responsible and should both pay and have charges pressed against him\n\nThe adolescents are the ones where I am most in two minds about - they are old enough to know better but probably don't have the money to pay either", "NTA How will they learn if they have no consequences. Thieves should pay for what they did. It was very generous of you not to press charges.", "NTA\n\nThose kids broke the law and committed a few crimes so why shouldn\u2019t they be held responsible? Financial adversity is not your concern. If they had enough time and energy to break in, they had enough time to go get a damn job.

I agree that keeping children away is a good idea, but sexual abuse is a completely different situation. Leveling it at someone who is blatantly wrong and doing something illegal is simply an overreaction.\n\nIf there were naked or underdressed children I'm on board with it.

You said he was probably hitting on a young girl. Do you comprehend?", ">How is sexual abuse \"obvious\" here?\n\nOh boy. Okay. I'm going to try and explain this as best as I can because it is true that this kind of thing is not obvious to everyone. However, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of treatment so I'm going to do my best and assume this question was asked in good faith, so I will give a good faith answer. \n\nGrooming is when someone builds a relationship through trust, emotional connection, familiarity, and/or by demonstrating they are someone \"fun\" to be around with the intent and purpose to manipulate, exploit, and potentially abuse them. A power dynamic is also a play here because the adult has means and influence a child does not. \n\nFor the record, this doesn't just happen to minors. This can also happen in dynamics between 18 year old and adults that are much older where the same outcome is desired by the grooming party. I absolutely love that Demi Levato came out with that new song \"29\" because its exactly what a grooming relationship looks like and it does not get talked about nearly enough (obviously). Just in her instance, the 29 year old wasn't someone's parent. \n\n Think about this yourself. In what scenario would you ever try to impress a group of children or teenage minors by breaking and entering someone's home and throwing a party for them? Can you think of any innocent reasons? When was the last time you wanted to impress a bunch of teens? Why would an adult our age WANT to seem cool to a bunch of teens/young children? Often those adults who want to seem cool have ulterior motives and there is a reason that other people responding are also pointing out this scenario as grooming. \n\nBecause this is a very common tactic. Get all the kids to like you. Act cool. Provide them with things the adults in their life wouldn't (like an illegal party at some stranger's home). Find the one who seems the easiest to manipulate,  tell them how mature they are for their age, yada yada yada. If and when something happens, the groomer now has a scenario where not only do they have what they want, they have a power dynamic that \"protects them\". The child in question will be afraid to tell an adult because they were already doing something they weren't supposed to. They will be afraid to tell their friends because \"Uncle Mike is just so cool! You're lying. He'd never do that!\". Or worse, they think they are \"in love\" so they are victimized all while thinking they are a willing participant.\n\nThose of us who have lived it, witnessed it, have been involved in investigations, etc. are now well aware of what it looks like from the outside as well as in. This scenario and this dynamic is where it starts. The lack of insight on this, especially from other adults who try to act like it's crazy to think it's anything else than them trying to be \"the cool uncle\", also helps perpetuate these things to continue. \n\nIf you want information on this, google will take you down one hell of a rabbit hole of investigations, cases, trials, etc all revolving around this.", "I\u2019m a child abuse survivor so maybe, just maybe I have some insight into the dark side of what can happen when people like you think everyone else\u2019s intentions are pure.", "Even in affluent homes, this is still groomer behavior.

You are certainly given leeway in such circumstances as it requires more force to subdue and restrain an attacker than it does to defend and let them go. \n\nBut the use of force will or rather can be investigated by itself as a crime if it seems appropriate i.e. you use waaay too much and it wasnt needed at all. \n\nAfterall, you cant simply hospitalise someone over a stolen burger or a few beers. But you could reasonably do it if they presented threat to life. Circumstances will be taken in context and as a whole.", "I wouldn\u2019t do it. But sadly there are people who would shoot regardless of it being kids or adults on their property because they saw trespassers. I was not saying that OP should have shot at them. I was saying that the parents should be thankful it didn\u2019t happen because sadly it is a possibility.", "Like everything it depends on the lawyer. \"Jumping a metal fence would be incredibly dangerous blablabla\" The laws fairly loose in definition and like most things its a matter of your lawyer.\n\nBut still OP would get stuck with dealing with the headline in all the papers \"Crazy home owner locks up children and refuses to let them leave until the police showed up to free them\". Am I the asshole of all subs should know how easily things can be spun to make you look correct.", "Yeah it was definitely that. There\u2019s no way a bunch of teenagers are sneaking off and having a party with 6 year olds and tweens in tow. If it was out of control teen behaviour they wouldn\u2019t be bringing their kid sister along.\n\nThis is the weirdest party I ever heard of. I bet there\u2019s some entitlement there, that because OP is so much more well off they\u2019re \u2018owed\u2019 it, and OP can afford it so it\u2019s of not consequence her house was destroyed", "He* OP identifies as male", "Wouldn\u2019t trust them in the house", "Isn\u2019t citizens arrest a thing?", "Yeah sounds like they just moved the latter", "CA are more likely to be family or close friend so definitely", "Ah good point. Thanks - I've corrected.", "Depends on the state but primarily only if you witness a felony and even then its normally only violent ones.\n\nAnd even then you would be hard pressed to find anyone to encourage you to do so since if its someone comitting a violent crime dont endanger yourself.", "This isn\u2019t a butlins type family friendly party. OP mentions blaring music and drinking going on, so even though there are small kids there for god knows what reason, it\u2019s a *party*.\n\nA fully grown man endorsed breaking and entering and is drinking with a bunch of tweens and teenagers. That is unsettling and isn\u2019t enough to get a guilty verdict but sure as hell sets off alarm bells.", "That is such a trend on reddit right now.  Posts be like: \"My (22f) boss (36m) refuses to grant time off b/c we are understaffed, AITA for complaining?\"  Now, obv not, time off, requested properly, should generally be granted ; but the comments will be full of: \"Gross, the Older male just wants your younger self at work to creep on you, so skeeved out!!\"  It's like one long junior high sleepover.", "And it\u2019s healthy to ignore that it\u2019s a possibility?", "So their kids:\n\n1. Trespassed\n\n2. Stole goods by using your things (gas propane, coal, maybe some food and ice).\n\n3. Littered\n\nAnd they say you are wrong? Those parents should be grateful you gave them the option to pay to avoid having their kids charged.\n\nNTA.\n\nAlso install cameras all over your property. This way, if you can't be there to delay their escape before the police arrive, you still have footage of them doing the crime. The police can go get them.", "I also get tired of all the *but I\u2019m a single mother* excuses on here too. That has no bearing on you facing the financial consequences of breaking the law.", "This isn\u2019t a family friendly butlins party being described. OP mentions lots of property damage, drinking, blaring loud music. This is a full on *party*.\n\nThe man tacitly approved of a bunch of tweens and teens breaking into a house and getting drunk. A grown man drinking and partying and drinking with a bunch of teenagers, that is extremely skeezy. \n\nEither they sent one lone male to be the babysitter, or just as likely a guy knew the local kids were having a party and wanted to take advantage of the situation. The latter happens a lot.\n\nThe only realistic situation where this guy is a babysitter I can comprehend is that the other adults were at the party, but were able to successfully escape before the police arrived.", "Oh yea the broken neck was worth it for sure, fucking people", "NTA. Claiming poverty is not an excuse to trespass and steal. No one is entitled to anything in this world and life seems unfair at times. These people knew what they were doing was wrong. They got caught and paid the price. They had a choice and they chose badly.", "But it was your house and your kids were there, not this guy, he was trespassing which means he was contributing to the delinquency of a minor"]}
