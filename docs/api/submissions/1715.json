Friday, I went to the market to buy drinks, meats and various things, because Sunday there would be a party in this house. So the fridge had a lot of things. \n\nOn Saturday, my brother called me asking if I had rented the house this Saturday for someone and when I said no, he informed me that he passed by and heard very loud music in it in addition to several voices. \n\nI asked him to meet me there and I went with my husband. There were about 20 people enjoying the pool, drinking and having a barbecue with my stuff. \nApparently they used a ladder to jump over the wall. The wall had a \"broken\" fence and will be replaced tomorrow. It's the only wall that faces the street. When they saw us, they started to get even more desperate that my brother had the ladder. \n\nThey tried to escape but we kind of protected the  wall.\n\nThe police had already been called, so we didn't want anyone to escape. Nothing happened to anyone to make it clear, they just tried to get past us to go to the lowest wall, but couldn't. \n\nThe police arrived. There were 7 children (6-13 yo), 12 adolescents (14-17 yo) and 1 adult (39 yo).\n\n Those responsible for the minors were called and this caused a mess, as they started to accuse us gor holding minors in my house when I am not a police authority.\n\n The police gave me the freedom to press charges or not, but I said I just wanted the value of the items consumed, pay for a cleaning lady and cleaning the pool. Yes, it would cost a high value, because the outside area was a mess and almost everything used in the fridge.\n\n The adults began to say that just scolding from the police would be enough and that I know how stupid young people can be and begged me not to charge that amount, as most of them were extremely poor. \n\nI stood by my decision, saying that they would have until today (Monday) to pay for my damage, otherwise I would press charges against everyone. Yes, I heard a lot of curses, but today I received the full amount. \n\nMy husband said that I was very harsh, because I paid out of my pocket anyway ( there was the party anyway) and that for us, there would be no difference that money, but for extremely poor families? Yes.\n\n I really don't think it's fair to have this expense, despite being able to pay without weighing on my pocket. Young people are stupid, but still they broke into a house, used everything in it and left a mess. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667836041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yoqvhi/aita_for_keep_in_the_house_children_and_teenagers/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Were these neighbors?", "NTA\n\nThey broke in, ate your food, and made a mess of the place.  Plus if anything happened to a kid there (ie break an arm or drown), you\u2019d be held responsible which isn\u2019t fair.  Those parents are lucky you didn\u2019t press charges and just demanded reimbursement.", "NTA - Almost all of them knew what they were doing was wrong. They made a choice to break in, steal, and use your property without consent. If someone drowned or was hurt on the property, there may have been liability for you etc. You were kinder than a lot of others would have been. I recommend surveillance cameras.", "NTA. They trespassed, ate your food, made a mess, and I'm betting they KNEW it was wrong but didn't care. Actions have consequences.", "They knowingly committed crimes.  If the parents are upset about having to pay, GOOD! It will entice them to make sure their kids never do this again.\n\nNTA", "NTA  press charges\n\n\"a scolding from the police should be enough\" lmao. Screw that noise. Funny how parents don't give a shit about what their kids do when it affects other people's property. Have mercy on the children! lol", "NTA\n\nI think you went easier on them considering you could\u2019ve pressed charges and chose not to, not to mention this is a great learning moment for consequences. On an off note though, what was a 39 year old doing trespassing with over a dozen minors.", "NTA but you really need cameras set up in your pool area & a lock on the outdoor fridge/cabinets.", "NTA\n\nWhat you did was allowed so dont mind what the criminals are thinking \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NTA\nThey were guilty of trespassing, theft, and property damage. Being \u201cextremely poor\u201d is not a valid excuse (or reason) for literally having a pool party at your expense. You were a lot nicer than I would have been; I would have pressed charges.", "Repairing the damage and returning what was consumed is the least the parents would have had to offer without even a request from you. You were very generous. I wouldn't have been so nice.", "NTA, but you\u2019re pretty nice. I\u2019d have pressed charges anyway.", "NTA. They were trespassing. IMO, it\u2019s reasonable to ask for them to pay for what they consumed and to clean up. Personally, I\u2019d have just pressed charges, so I think you\u2019re being very kind.", "NTA\n\nThey played stupid games and won stupid prizes.", "NTA. Bring poor doesn't exempt people from wrongdoings.", "NTA\n\nI would have pressed charges and then taken them to small claims court for the money\n\nYou let them off easy", "NTA\n\nThe were trespassing on your property, for those parents to get upset at you holding their children responsible kinda shows where these kids got the idea to jump into your pool in the first place.", "Nta. Actions have consequences, though I think you should've just pressed charges so the consequences were on the teens rather than mommy and daddy.", "It really sucks for the parents to have to shell out $ for their kids behavior. But that's part of being a parent. Now these kids have to deal with their parents fury AND the shame of making their family finances even worse. That's the stuff that hits home. Letting them off with a scolding from the police won't do a thing, they'll all laugh about it with their buddies and figure out who else they can try to screw over. You're doing them a favor in the long run by holding them all accountable.", "NTA. Kids gotta learn. Action=consequence", "NTA", "NTA. If nothing else, you (hopefully) taught them a lesson.", "NTA\n\nPlease tell your husband that instead of rewarding criminal behavior, he would better serve his community by investing in the families who need help.  Bailing out criminals is not the way to aid poor families.  Take the money paid to repair the damage done, and invest in education, after school care, whatever the community needs.  Or, instead of cash, have the involved individuals contribute work towards repairing homes, supporting the disabled or whatever the community needs.\n\nIf you didn't press charges on the adult in that group, IMO, you made a mistake.", "NTA \n\nPressing charges would have caused some of those minors alot more damage long term, and they had no right to trespass in that manner.  Do stupid stuff, get consequences.  And maybe a lesson will stick as those parent's will be finding ways for their children to earn some of that money back.", "NTA.  They broke into your home and used your things?  This is not ok on any level.", "NTA", "NTA\nThey should have thought of the cost before stealing your stuff and trespassing", "Nta - if there was only a scolding they would have come back the next week. These kids' parents are the real assholes here.", "NTA. Being poor is not an excuse to be rude or have no manners. I was poor as heck growing up but was raised with the best of manners and respect for other people's things and property. These people give poor people a bad name, because most of us poor folk are good people. You handled this perfectly. B/C now maybe they will think twice.", "NTA in any way. Those adults had a lot of nerve to say that a scolding from the police would be enough when your kids had damaged your property and eaten your food. You would have been within your rights to press charges, especially against the adult.", "NTA\n\n>My husband said that I was very harsh, because I paid out of my pocket anyway ( there was the party anyway) and that for us, there would be no difference that money, but for extremely poor families? Yes.\n\nThe thing is, these people aren't entitled to break onto your property, use and damage your things, just because the monetary value to fix it wouldn't be an inconvenience for you. \n\nIt might suck for the low income families that have to cover the cost, but now they have learned a lesson too. Maybe the cost they had to pay will help get their audacity in check.", "NTA\n\nHowever I wouldn't press charges or expect payment from the youngsters, they would have been influenced by the elder ones (especially the 6 year old) and for them a telling off by the police is likely enough\n\nThe adult is entirely responsible and should both pay and have charges pressed against him\n\nThe adolescents are the ones where I am most in two minds about - they are old enough to know better but probably don't have the money to pay either", "NTA How will they learn if they have no consequences. Thieves should pay for what they did. It was very generous of you not to press charges.", "NTA\n\nThose kids broke the law and committed a few crimes so why shouldn\u2019t they be held responsible? Financial adversity is not your concern. If they had enough time and energy to break in, they had enough time to go get a damn job. It\u2019s not your responsibility to care.\n\nTheir parents trying to brush it off as innocent child behavior is the reason they did it in the first place. Maybe now that they have to pay for their lackadaisical parenting maybe they\u2019ll put in work to teach better.", "NTA- tbh you probably should have pressed charges when the first person complained about repaying for damages.", "NTA. You're obviously not in the US, so I don't know how getting the cops to shake down your neighbours for cash would even work. Do they hold someone hostage? Do they make up fines on the spot and issue \"tickets\"?", "You have to pay to play. A good lesson for all freeloaders.", "NTA but\u2026. Having grown up extremely poor and having an out of control sister who used to get in trouble all the time, this is really triggering me. Some of those kids are going to go to bed hungry until their parent\u2019s next paycheck. If this had been me, I would have forced the 39-year old to foot the ENTIRE bill. Out of everyone there, he should have known better. Also, since you\u2019ve already been reimbursed, I get the feeling the parents are good people doing their best.\n\nMy take\u2026 charge the only adult present and let the kids off with just the fear of law enforcement (which probably scared them silly) and discipline of their parents.\n\nOk folks\u2026.
