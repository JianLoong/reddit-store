That money will actually be for your parents.  If you ever, even just 1 single time, say yes and give them just $1, they will hound you for the rest of your life.  They will never stop asking, and when you say no, they will go nuclear on you. They'll cry. If that doesn't work they'll threaten. If that doesn't work, they try to steal from you. Then they'll lie about you.  \n\nNever get money involved. You will regret it so hard.  \n\n\nI'm sorry your parents failed you.  Cut them off for good and try your best to live a happy life. Just make sure your grandparents get the thanks they deserve.  They seem like great people.", "You are NTA.", "What a lovely couple of people these two are \ud83d\ude11\nI think you've answered your own question, NTA. If they were such bad parents that CPS got involved, and even their own parents are documenting evidence against them, then they don't have a case.\nNow if you're concerned that you may be the AH over the going to hell comment, the answer is still no, you reacted as anyone else would have.", "NTA. You\u2019re showing maturity and moral clarity under difficult circumstances. Respect! Also three cheers to your grandparents for stepping up", "NTA: Rule of thumb, if CPS is ever involved, it\u2019s not the kid\u2019s fault.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re parents have no idea how much it can screw up a kid to have to basically become a parent to their siblings.

Took such good care of me. I was never sick for weeks at a time because they didn't take me to the doctor. I was never left hungry because they didn't leave enough food for my siblings and me.

My grandparents and I really hate it. At least during our lockdown we had zero contact with them but once that order was lifted the visits started back up. I hate looking at their stupid faces.", "if they keep up this behavior an outbursts at visits you might be able to get visitation reduced"]}
