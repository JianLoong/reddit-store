You\u2019re parents have no idea how much it can screw up a kid to have to basically become a parent to their siblings.

Took such good care of me. I was never sick for weeks at a time because they didn't take me to the doctor. I was never left hungry because they didn't leave enough food for my siblings and me.

Get a job if you can, assuming you are keeping up with school OK, and start saving money. When you are 18 and can afford it, consider moving somewhere new (even if not for college), and do not give anyone your phone or address.

Tough cookies, they lost all right to that when they forced you to be a third parent as a 16 year old.", "NTA.

In my opinion, the people who are rude and disrespectful are your life givers for parentifying you and being negligent in the performance of their parenting duties. Considering the fact that they want to re-parentify you by demanding that you become a free babysitter for the kids in their new families, I say that they don't deserve to be in your life whatsoever.

I'm sorry. You are so NTA. You deserve a life and a childhood and I do hope that you are getting that from your grandparents. I mean doing chores and learning how to adult as you grow up is important, but becoming the designated parent so your parents don't have to is absolutely wrong and revolting.", "NTA.

IMHO, their manipulations makes them the A.\n\nThere's not enough here for me to talk about whether/how toxic the family of origin is, you sort of have to figure out on your own whether it was so toxic that, even though you moved out, further steps are needed.

They failed badly as parents as far as you were concerned... to the extent that CPS took you away from them and gave custody of you to your grandparents, and from all accounts... they do NOT do this sort of thing lightly.  It takes parents really screwing up badly for them to lose custody.\n\nNTA.

Yowza.", "Your parents not only left in you charge of your siblings but wouldn't take you to a doctor or leave enough food in the house for thier children?! Super glad you are out of there and frankly telling them to go to Hell was nicer than I would have been.", "These parents weren't talking about any 'relationship' and kudos to OP for seeing that.  They were just looking for that free babysitter they used to severely abuse and wanted to again.", "You may also, depending on what state you live in, be able to emancipate yourself from your parents.", "The past parentification or the future parentification??  \n\nAnd the future stuff wouldn't be for just one family but TWO separate families.

Certainly not even for the swearing.", "More specifically, they wouldn't have enough for me. They knew and expected me to make sure my siblings were fed no matter what. And yes, they would make sure to take my siblings to the doctor whenever they got sick. Usually I had to be sick for ages before they would take me. Or I had to get really bad.", "Got to say that a 12 year old having the stones to report parentification to CPS and then making it stuck is impressive.

Stay safe and life your best life.", "I feel you. I love my Lil bro so so much, but I still can't help but resent the fact that sometimes I had to starve so he could eat", "So... if you literally just have to be in the same room as them,  it wouldn't matter if you got an oversized sweater,  giant reading glasses,  and started using this time to read books out loud in overly friendly tones?
