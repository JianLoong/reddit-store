{"id": 24171, "submission_id": "15lgkbb", "title": "WIBTA for asking my husband to stop shaving his body hair?", "selftext": "Me (29F) and my husband (29M) have been together for over 5 years and married for 2 of those years. When I met him, he had lovely facial hair and the typical body hair for a man. He's always been underweight for most of his life and has struggled to gain weight, and we finally got a medical diagnosis and treatment for the underlying issue and since then, he's put on 20lbs and is now in the normal BMI. With that, he's started going to the gym more often as he said that now he's able to actually put on muscle and keep it, whereas before he would never be able to maintain enough body weight to sustain muscle growth. \n\nA few months after starting up at the gym, he asked me how I would feel if he shaved off some of his body hair. He said that he noticed a lot of guys who are also into muscle building or weight lifting tend to shave or not have much body hair to more clearly see the muscle definition. I thought it would be a one time experiment that might be fun, so I went along with it. One weekend he shaved off everything except for the hair on top of his head. His facial hair, arm hair, chest hair, leg hair, everything. He didn't look \"bad,\" but that visceral reaction of seeing his manly hairy chest and arms was gone. The sex that weekend also felt different, but in a good way? While his appearance seemed less \"manly,\" he seemed invigorated and more sensual and was really into it in a way that was hard to explain.\n\nNext weekend he shaved again, and he has kept it going now for over 6 months. At first I was okay with it, but now it seems a bit excessive. He confided in me shortly afterwards that he never really liked his body hair, and had some trauma from being bullied for being extremely hairy as a young teenager before the other kids in his class had any body hair. He said he never felt comfortable getting rid of it until he started seeing that it was more accepted among athletic guys. \n\nAt first I was okay with it because I thought it would be a fun short term experiment but that he wouldn't keep up with it, as I know how much work it is to upkeep, but it's been going on for 6 months+ now. There's times when he's smoother than I am and it makes me feel somewhat insecure. He said he doesn't really care if I shave or not, and that he's completely against the \"gender norms\" of women having to be smooth and men having to be hairy, and while I kind of agree, I do also miss that visceral \"manliness\" reaction of seeing him with body hair. I also notice that when we go out and he's wearing his shorts showing his smooth legs, people do sometimes stare or throw eyes on him and at us, and it can make me slightly uncomfortable. \n\nHe even recently purchased one of those IPL hair removal devices off amazon and says he plans to use it all over so that he doesn't have to shave as often. I feel like the thought of him never having body hair again is too much for me. Would I be the asshole if I asked him to stop doing all of this and let his hair grow back?

I love my arm and leg hair but I hate hair on my chest and neither regions. I did keep it shaved all the time and now I keep it trimmed. Speak with him and I\u2019m sure you both can find ways to make it all work. \ud83d\ude3a I\u2019m glad to hear he is working out and able to gain weight and I\u2019m sure you helped encourage him to sort out what was going on so I\u2019m sure you can do it for this as well.", "Yes you\u2019d be the AH.

It's not your place to tell your partner what to do with his hair. It's his body.

Hes made it very clear he likes it so asking him to stop shaving isnt your place to say. How would you like it if he asked you to shave your head? Maybe he preferred you if you were bald? How would you feel about that?", "YTA, you can voice your preference and let him decide what to do. But asking him not to do it it's a bit too much, specially knowing he has trauma from beinig bullied from being hairy.

Who cares what they think?", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYou can tell him you prefer his body hair but that is it, after all he was insisting you shave all your body hair he would be crucified here.

I mean, do you actively want to make him uncomfortable in his own body?\n\nThe only thing you could do is discuss it in the softest most gentle not even suggesting or asking anything way, saying that your always found his body hair very sexy. And even that I\u2019d only suggest in case he brings up the topic himself, and your words can act as a form of reassurance that he looks beautiful and desirable to you no matter what.", "NAH. You would not be an asshole for preferring hairy and for expressing that. He is not an asshole for liking the shaved look. Just remember that ultimately it is his body and his decision.", "YTA\n\nHis body, his choice, and you know he dislikes body hair\n\nYour insecurities about your own hair are yours to work through, not to project onto him", "YTA , it might be a little selfish from you to think about what people think about you for being \"less feminine\" and not put his insecurity or his trauma a part first , his body his choice you shouldn't decide.", "NAH - seems like an opportunity for both of you to grow out of your insecurities, if each of you is quite happy with the other in the state you're insecure about. He's ok with you not shaving, and you're happy with him being hairy. It's definitely worth talking about, but ultimately you'll have to accept whatever he wants to do with his body, and visa versa.", "YTA no doubt", "I can't agree with dictating your partner's grooming habits. It sounds like he's got the right idea by saying that he doesn't care if you shave or not. I'm sure your self-esteem would be shot if one day he criticised you for being too hairy, so I don't think you can expect a different reaction if you criticise him for the opposite.\n\nIt sounds like hair removal has been his way of exorcising demons from his past and that he's feeling far more like himself now. You've even pointed out that he's more 'sensual' in bed because of this new confidence boost. In your position, I would only want to view this as a positive thing.\n\nI wouldn't go so far to say YWBTA here, because preferences are preferences, but if you did decide to ask him to change back (and he complied), you'd be stripping him of this newfound confidence and comfort with himself, and you shouldn't be surprised if he ends up resenting you for that.", "As a guy, I don't think there is anything wrong with this. Maybe just start complimenting him more, and you can definitely let him know that you liked when he was hairy too lol", "YTA he seems to be happy and content with shaving his body hair no one cares if it isn't \"manly\" let the guy do his thing it ain't hurting you.", "YTA", "NAH. You best time for honesty was before you helped him shave. The next best time would be now. Just know he might keep shaving and that\u2019s ok too.", "you feeling insecure is not his problem. ultimately you both need to have a straightforward conversation that doesn't put the blame on either of you - his preference to shave his body hair is not the reason you feel insecure, though you have a right to those emotions as much as he has a right to his preference. i think NAH - so long as you both respect each other's emotions, desires, and bodily autonomy.", "Nah....you're allowed to have your preference, but is he. This is a situation where one of you will just have to accept it and live with it. This shouldn't be a marriage ending issue. Maybe once in awhile he can grow it out for you.", "YTA\n\nit\u2019s his body and you\u2019re clearly just insecure that people will view him as less manly, and you\u2019re projecting that fear onto random strangers. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t care if you shave or not, why can\u2019t you offer him the same treatment?", "YTA\nYour husband is his own person. You\u2019re both allowed to grow in the relationship. I\u2019m sure at some point you\u2019ll want to change something with your appearance and you\u2019ll expect him to support you on it and be happy for you, especially if it\u2019s something you\u2019ve always wanted to do and makes you feel more confident. \nI once had an ex apologize for having so much body hair the first time we had sex.

If you make a big deal out of the no YWBTA. \nIt's his body and his choice and he seems to have a lot of reasons to prefer being shaved.\nYou also ascribing \"manliness\" to body hair is weird. We're all mammals, we all have body hair. I've met men with less than me and men with more than me. I've met hairier and less hairy women. Mammals. We're all mammals ffs. Work on that internalized idea. \nAnd if his body hair or lack thereof is a dealbreaker for you, you are an incredibly shallow and selfish person.

I used to shave my chest and belly until my GF told me she loved seeing my chest with hair, in a really nice way (she told me she felt i was manly and sexy, like wolverine haha)\n\nThis makes us feel powerful and desired, like it's OK to be a \"manly, hairy man\". So comunicate with your husband.\n\nI don't understand people here saing you're the AH... people have preferences and it's not like you are body shaming him.\n\nNTA, but do talk to him.", "YWBTA\n\nThe arms thing is a little strange to me, but plenty of runners/bikers I know shave their legs, and shaving everything else is fairly normal as well. Nothing wrong with having preferences but it is his body and it\u2019s a fairly shallow thing to get hung up on, I\u2019d say the increased BMI and muscle growth gives a more \u201cmanly\u201d appearance than just having a lot of hair. You \u201cwent along with it\u201d for long enough that now he feels comfortable/free from past trauma and it\u2019s a habit of his, should\u2019ve said something sooner honestly, but now you want him to go back to being uncomfortable and insecure because of your preference and you not liking the looks you get.", "I think you screwed up little bit when he told you about bullying. This was your opportunity to boost his confidence and tell him you like it and it makes him manly in your eyes. You still should tell him that its something you always secretely liked and realized it just now, tell him basicly what you said here. Say that it was interesting experience but you very much liked him with body hair and he should be proud of it because it looked good on him. Say that you you will respect his decision either way tho.", "NTA you both have a right to what makes you comfortable and what you find sexy; however, his thinking seems to be derived from psychological issues and that is where I think professional help should be explored before semipermanent/permanent measures are taken. Once he is more comfortable with why he wants to make these changes and with that information he still chooses to pursue going hairless then he also has to accept the possibility of changes in/to the relationship.\n\nI understand the attraction to hairy men and it could definitely make or break a relationship where sex is involved for me.", "YTA, he has made it clear that he'll accept you regardless of your body hair, while you are turning his into a point of contention. He has discovered something about himself that makes him more confident and happy, and you want him to stop for what? So you can win the smooth skin contest?", "NAH. You can ask - *once* - but he\u2019s allowed to say no.", "NAH.  I've had similar experiences. My wife likes me having more body hair.  I used to get poked and prodded for having chest hair and hit a point where I just started shaving it.  I'm also muscular, Italian... I just kind of assumed that my wife like it all better shaved (because that's my preference for her), but she told me one day she liked my body hair how it was before.  I was totally fine with it and basically just compromised. Instead of totally shaving my armpits and chest, I just trim them with a \"1\" length every few weeks.  I shave every 3 days instead of daily, so I almost always have some stubble.  I've never shaved my arms or legs because (IMO) that's a bit much. So now, I have body hair but it's not crazy. I would just tell him your preference, but that you love him and it's his choice.", "YTA. He might have a reason for needing to do this. It's his body, his choice. He probably is not comfortable with the body hair here and there. You are not stopping and listen to him about his experiences if he's choosing to share them with you.", "NAH. You're OK having preferences and asking IF you're okay with hearing no.", "\"I also notice that when we go out and he's wearing his shorts showing his smooth legs, people do sometimes stare or throw eyes on him\"\n\nThis is almost certainly entirely in your head. No one cares how much hair is on some stranger's legs. That would be such a weird thing to think about.\n\n\"He's completely against the \"gender norms\" of women having to be smooth and men having to be hairy, and while I kind of agree [with him]\" \n\nBut you immediately follow-up with how you agree with the norms.\n\nYTA. It's his choice. Just get over it.", "YWBTA if you asked him to stop without at least expressing to him how you are more attracted to him with body hair.  You said he has always been self conscious about it, but you never said that you make him feel desired for having it.  \n\nMaybe a happy medium.  Let him use his IPL to thin the hair (IPL is nowhere near as effective as laser hair removal).  Then he can trim instead of shave.", "Am I like the only one who talks to my SO?", "NTA.\n\nYou can ask, he can refuse. But there def something up there with his attitude that's you guys should talk about.", "YTA. From what you describe, he's made his preferences very clear. Any insecurities are yours to deal with. By asking him not to shave, I think you are going to create a bigger issue than what it needs to be because you are going to undercut his self confidence.", "WYBTA for asking? No. But, that conversation should have a resolution you can both agree with. Maybe he grows back the facial hair, since he's probably not seeing gains there. \n\nSo, NTA for asking, but be prepared for the conversation.", "NAH, you can ask and he is free to refuse.\n\nJust tell him exactly what you just said here, add that you disagree with his bully, and that you will support his choice no matter what.", "YTA. You can ask by your reason for asking is shitty. How would you feel if he said he wasn't as attracted to you because you had pubic hair? He is happy and he is comfortable, if you are bothered about random strangers (who I promise you 99% of the time do not care) then that is a problem you need to solve and not one he needs to solve.", "YTA & NTA at the same time", "Yes YWBTA if you asked him to do it.\n\nHOWEVER! YWNBTA if you just told him that you prefer him with body hair. Ultimately it is his choice whether he wants to shave or not, but you're allowed to tell him about your preference and what you like the most. Especially since he asked about your opinion originally.\n\nDon't tell him what to do. Tell him what you like.", "NAH, you can ask *but you have to accept his answer if he says no*. At the end of the day this is his body and his choice, and what\u2019s most important is that he is comfortable in his body even if it may not match your preferences", "Yta if you just ask, but you can always say \"I miss your body hair, it makes you more manly looking in my eyes\"", "It depends - personally I love my DH\u2019s body hair, but he finds it itchy in the summer. Our compromise is he trims it back rather than removes it all - everyone is happy. He asked my opinion about it out of the blue once and this is where we are at. You would NTA to ask, but yeah you have to respect what he wants too", "YTA", "NAH, but it depends how you ask.\n\n'I really like your body hair and I was wondering how you felt about keeping it.' This is basically saying, 'here's how I feel, what do you think?' You're allowed to share your feelings in a non-forceful way, breaching it as a discussion instead, so he will feel comfortable chatting with you about it.\n\n'Can you stop shaving?' This comes off as an order and offers no explanation as to why you want him to. With his sensitive history around body hair, this would probably be interpreted negatively.\n\nAlso, it's likely he won't stop shaving, because he seems to care deeply about this. So if he says he wants to continue, don't pressure him, that would definitely make you an AH. You are allowed to let him know this means a lot to you - just don't push it after a firm 'no'.", "Yea YTA after learning how insecure he is about his body hair. Your needs aren\u2019t the only one whose needs matter. And it\u2019s his body, his hair, he can do whatever the hell he wants with it.", "NTA to ask kindly, but be prepared to accept and be ok with a no. If you aren\u2019t ok with it YWTBA, remember, his body, his choice", "NAH - you can express a preference (in a positive way) but it's his body so his choice.", "Tell him you miss his body hair", "What was the medical diagnosis?", "YTA. You basically would be asking him to stop doing something that clearly makes him feel more confident and good simply because of your own insecurities and what other people think. It\u2019s his body his choice. YWNBTA to voice your *preference*, but if he says he wants to keep shaving then YWBTA to push it or try and make him feel bad about it. I think it really depends on how you approach it. To me it\u2019s no different than a guy telling a girl he prefers her with blonde hair, but she loves how she looks as a brunette and now feels bad and pressured to change just to please them. There is a big difference between \u201cWould you ever consider doing X?\u201d and \u201cPlease do X because I\u2019m not as attracted to you the way you are\u201d. Both are implying or stating a preference but one leaves room for their partners own preference and the other pressures and makes them feel bad if they don\u2019t comply.", "It's ok to tell him you like his body hair, but ywbta if you asked him to stop shaving.", "YTA. His body, his choice. If he likes going hairless, let him be. Come on, are you in love with the man or with his hair?", "Nothing wrong about having preferences and sharing them with your husband. But this does not mean you should just tell it to him, and I think you are aware of the complicated nature of the situation.\n\nIf he is uncomfortable about being hairy, honestly I would keep that to myself, but he may also feel better about being that way if he knows you will find him more attractive.\n\nIn the end no one here knows your husband and it is on you to judge the situation. I'd say if you are not sure and it is something you may grow to like more over time, just keeping it to yourself may be the best choice. But if you think there might be a solid chance he might feel comfortable being a bit more like you want, it may be worth a shot. \n\nIn the end you cannot certainly know the outcome, but if you do the thing you believe will lead to a healthy outcome for both of you, YWNBTA. Just make sure you give it enough thought.\n\nA final note, sometimes we can add meanings to things without realising just because we are looking for signs. Be careful not to do that and try to emphatize as much as possible. Don't forget that sometimes you have to compromise, and compromising in a healthy way can be really fulfilling in its own.", "YTA. His body. His choice.", "YTA \"he makes me feel insecure\", that's a you problem, he's finally comfortable shaving, something he's been wanting to do for a long time and now you want him to stop because now you feel you're competing with him on who's smoother, that's just wrong", "YTA. It's his body. How would you feel if he told you to shave your legs more or have your hair a certain length?", "NTA.  Let him know what you like.  I do things to help please my wife... and there may be a middle choice.\n\nCan he \"trim\" without fully SHAVING everything?", "YWBTA.  His body, his choice.", "Oh, absolutely without question, YTA.", "YTA. his body, his choice. If this was a man trying to make a woman shave, there wouldn\u2019t be a single person saying you\u2019re NTA.", "NAH - you can tell him your preference but thats it, because it is his body and he can do what he wants.", "NTA to ask. You could become an AH depending on your reaction if he says no.", "YTA\n\nThis is something that bothered him for years.  He was even bullied over his hairiness as a teenager.  He's happy and healthy now.  Accept him as is, or move on.  He deserves someone that supports him.", "As a hairy dude, it\u2019s nice to be with women who like my body hair (and not with those who don\u2019t). He might be pleasantly surprised to hear your positive thoughts.", "YTA He seems to really enjoy it and himself- he\u2019s happy. Why would you want to do anything besides cheering him on?", "Well... you can not like it. That doesn't make you an asshole. BUT. Is his appearance that important to you? I mean, yes, we are all physically attracted to our partner, at least at first, but to make someones appearance a deal breaker... not cool really. What if you gained a few pounds and he said, you need to lose weight? That wouldn't be great now would it? If you're in love, does it matter that much if he likes to be hairless? \n\nI think it's fine to explain to him that your preference is for him to have body hair. He can either choose to cede to your wishes or not. But if his decision to be hairless is \"too much for you\", then it's time to end a relationship based on looks alone.", "It feels like a conversation you should have. It\u2019s down to him, and it seems like you listen and understand his reasoning. He should hear yours too, if you share them sensitively and understand that ultimately it\u2019s down to him.", "YTA. I get it. My husband was hairy when we first got together and over time started shaving more and more of his body. Eventually doing home ipl and now has none. I preferred the hair and I think it\u2019s fine to say so but ultimately he gets to decide what he does to his body.", "NAH. I think you just need to have an open conversation. No accusations or any negativity or how other people look at him when out. Other people's opinions do not matter and are not important, especially strangers on a street. Fuck em.\n\nJust have a talk. Tell him your preference and acknowledge his desires.", "YWBTAH His body, his choice. A person needs to feel comfortable in their own skin. He finally does and you want to take that away because you no longer get some visceral feeling about his body hair? What if he had developed alopecia and all of his body hair had came off because of this and no longer grew? You telling me that you would love him less, be less attracted to him because he has no body hair? Is there really a difference between having made the choice to be smooth and having no choice but to be smooth in this situation? How would you feel if you had you hair styled a certain way or a cut a certain length and he decided to tell you, \"Hey, honey, I am struggling with not feeling attracted to you on a physical level. The way you *insert some body autonomy thing you like that actually makes you feel good about yourself and gives you confidence here* is really bothering me. I thought you were going through some phase and would be over this by now. Would you mind changing back to how you looked before for me so that my feelings can change into something more favorable?\"\n\n\n Yeah.. that's what I thought.", "NAH. You would not be an asshole for preferring hairy and for expressing that. He is not an asshole for liking the shaved look. Just remember that ultimately it is his body and his decision.", "It would be fine if you told him how you feel about it, but YWBTA if you asked him not to shave just because you don\u2019t like it. \n\nYou can share your feelings with him so he can make a choice with those feelings in mind, but the choice should really be his.", "YTA my partner shaves all parts of his body mainly due to sport and taping but pretty sure some because he wants to like his chest but again mainly sport and a habit from sport. He doesn\u2019t shave his whole body but ankles etc to tape and same with wrist/shoulder and whatever others injuries he has but if he wanted to do more that\u2019s on him. I don\u2019t question it though because I just don\u2019t give a fuck. He doesn\u2019t comment about how I shave and I don\u2019t comment on his. It really doesn\u2019t effect me at all. Like not at all!", "YTA. I'm sorry, but if this was the other way round, you'd be torn apart. His body, his choice.", "You can ask and be fine but if you try to force him to grow it back yta. It's his choice on what he wants to do with his body after all", "worth raising he might be shaving it out of insecurity. if he hears his wife actually loves his body hair, he might feel less insecure about it overall and it might mean he\u2019ll end up deciding he doesn\u2019t need to shave it. or maybe not! i don\u2019t think mentioning your preference makes OP an AB. doing an ultimatum, e.g. \u201ci\u2019ll break up with you unless you stop shaving\u201d would be clearly AH behaviour", "Yeah shaving body hair is totally ok. If the guy was asking her to cover her legs because people throw looks, it would be sexist. It is also sexist to think he is supposed to be hairy because he is a man and he should grow hair because of \"looks\"", "This. The whole post reads as \"my husband overcame his insecurity and I am jealous. Would it be rude of me to restore that insecurity so that I am once again hotter than he is?\"", "Worth noting, we don\u2019t always know how we will like things, and we don\u2019t always know how we will react with things we\u2019re used to missing.\n\nI think it\u2019s perfectly normal that it took some time for OP to come to the conclusion that she preferred more body hair after giving less body hair a fair trial. Especially the case when it seems to have given her husband a large self-esteem boost.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019ll tell you what, when I see a man with luscious, shiny, hairless calves, it does catch my eye but only because they glisten beautifully in the sunlight \u2728 I also have a weird affinity with calves though because I have never been able to exercise mine to the size I want them lol so if I see some fit calves I\u2019m like, damn, wish it were me.", "Agreed, I\u2019ve never in my life noticed a man\u2019s leg hair or lack of \u2014 I think you\u2019re really overthinking what other people notice OP.", "Then it should he NAH", "This is the thing, they are married. There is an expectation of honesty and support in a marriage. You are allowed to talk to your husband about your feelings and preferences. You are not allowed to control his behaviors or make him feel bad about his choices. OP can tell him about how sexy she thinks his hairy body is and how much of a turn on it was for her but can not demand he grow it bad. NAH\n\nPSA to couple of AITA, it's OK to talk to your spouse about your feelings. Just be kind, honest, and respectful about it!", "This is true but OP also shouldn\u2019t feel bad for not liking a fundamental change that her partner has made, out of vanity, after they got together. She\u2019s allowed a preference.", "This would be an awful thing to say and just perpetuates the husband's insecurity even more.", "Trim is worst of bother worlds except on base of dick.", "Had an ex who trimmed everything. Cue full body rash after being intimate. Fucking painful, do not recommend.", "Yeah, \u201cI wish you\u2019d shave your legs more, it\u2019s unladylike to be so hairy\u201d would get this man hung in the streets", "Oooh, you have a point there.", "This", "Men and women are different and have wildly different pressures put on them. 'If it was the other way around' means nothing", "Where the hell did i tell her to lie lol?", "No disagreements there.", "Or it could raise his confidence about his body hair. She can tell him it doesn't matter what old bullies used to say and that she likes his body hair.", "Gotta trim the hedges so the tree stands taller.", "It DOES though.", "\ud83d\ude4c", "Until men the disgust at male body hair is so severe that they are never portrayed in any form of media with it ever, almost every man feels the need to shave it all off, and any non-shaved men are starred at and harassed in public, no, it's not the same", "\u2026perhaps we are from different parts of the world, because we have had wildly different experiences with this. The first time I shaved my arms and legs, people thought it was the weirdest thing ever. I was questioned constantly and even occasionally mocked.\n\nMy experience is that, outside of bodybuilding/weightlifting, and queer circles, the societal pressure on men is to keep their body hair, and that shaving it is weird.", "I think you're having trouble understanding the point Pixie is making here.\n\nThey're not saying man and woman have the same pressures put on them, they're saying that if the opposite happened : fe: he complained to her that she was doing something to her body esthetically that she felt was right but he felt wasn't to his liking. there would be outrage.", "That shouldn't have happened. I'm sorry you were mocked.", "This is probably the real reason people are arguing with my comment. I heard Americans are a lot weirder about men shaving, where I live it's not really that unusual, it's just a personal preference", "I understand perfectly and that's exactly what my reply is addressing - men's bodies aren't policed to anywhere the same extent as women's, so it really isn't the same if you reverse the gender in these situations", "Gender policing happens to people of all genders and is always wrong. It\u2019s true it\u2019s not necessarily as loaded for men as women, or as aggressively or violently enforced, but it\u2019s obvious a lot of what\u2019s going on for husband here involves a lot of social scripts he\u2019s gotten over the years and body image issues. All of that is tied up in gender scripts and ideas of masculinity which are, if in different degrees and ways, socially enforced for men as well as women.", "I mean... all the differences you listed are literally my point lol. I never said there are no gendered norms that are expected of men, just that they arent really comparable experiences at all", "But they are absolutely meaningfully comparable here. He is dealing with and grappling with body image in a way that is deeply connected with gender norms. Wife\u2019s account is totally loaded with that with her missing the \u201cmanliness\u201d of hair and feeling insecure that people might be looking at his shaved legs (and him finding a way to exist with hair that makes him feel happier required him seeing it as permissible for men, which he finally found at the gym).\n\nThat\u2019s about social gender norms that harm and restrict men as well as women, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s particularly helpful here to act like it\u2019s a false or unfitting comparison even if, on a societal level, we see some differences in type or degree with regard to how gendered body norms are enforced or monitored for women as opposed to men.", "People would oppose a man making these kinds of comments to a woman a lot more because women are already aggressively policed in this way all the time. It's very obvious how they aren't the same and anyone who claims otherwise is being deliberately obtuse"]}
