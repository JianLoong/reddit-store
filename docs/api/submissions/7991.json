(He wasn't in our state at that time) That's not a big deal, I straightened that out with every woman he brought over. I asked him to stop running single shirts in my gas dryer and buy an iron/ironing board. He refuses and blows the thermal overload fuse, so I'm now without a dryer.\n\nHe's a bartender/server, so he only works a couple days a week. I ask him to take care of the house because I'm a union industrial maintenance person and work between 40 and 60 hours a week, depending on breakdowns. In addition to his cleaning duties, I lowered his rent from $600 a month (half mortgage payment) to $350. He does not pay for internet, trash services (he wanted, I took it to work), or security (ADT). He only pays half water and electric. \n\nI need clothes to wear and I don't have a way to dry them. I fix the dryer after ordering the part from LG. He doesn't offer to help fix it. He then does it again, so this time, I pulled the wiring harness so he couldn't use it and told him to go to the laundromat. He bemoans. My cat gets sick and needs surgery. I paid for the surgery. She has stitches and abdominal wounds. I tell him not to let her out. He let's her out. She gets injured, and I'm on the hook for an additional bill. He doesn't apologize. He downplays. \n\nThe next thing he does is ask to get a kitten. I agree as long as my cat gets along. He got *TWO* male kittens. My cat does not get along after a month. They stalk her and resource guarding. I buy half dozen litter pans, food bowls, and scratchers to no avail. She's so aggravated that she begins attacking my face while I sleep. I tell him to get them out of my house and he refuses so I tell him to leave too.\n\n\nHe then begins slamming doors and stomping about.

He sounds like a roommate from hell.", "NTA. How did you not do it sooner???", "NTA, he's not your friend and I'm surprised you've waited as long as you have. I'm curious how you owe him money? Since it he doesn't even pay is share of bills and he's costed you how much with the dryer and vet bills.", "NTA. Seems like he was taking advantage of your generosity.   \ntime and time again not sure why you thought he would take care of two cats if he couldnt handle previous issues but i chalk it up to you being overly nice. Please dont let people take advantage of you in the future if your letting someone stay in your home write up a lease that they need to stick if they are going to be staying with you if they fail to do these things kick them out and stick by the rules you set or they will walk over you thinking its okay too cause your friends.", "NTA. He\u2019s inconsiderate and has ignored your requests time and time again. He got 2 kittens and yet how is it that it\u2019s you who\u2019s spending on litter boxes and scratching posts. He\u2019s irresponsible, a pain, and simply not worth being your roommate. \n\nYou mentioned you owe him money. But you\u2019ve also lowered his rent and spent money on cat stuff, in addition to him costing you your dryer. Is there any chance you\u2019ve already paid him what you owe with all this?", "NTA.  He is taking advantage of you and your situation.  And being an unpleasant and irresponsible roommate.  Time for him to go.", "NTA. Kick that parasite out before he causes more damage to you, your house, or your cat.\n\nJust make sure you\u2019re kicking him out legally though. If you had him sign anything at all (like a lease agreement), look it over very carefully first and consider consulting with an attorney. You\u2019ll also want to create and keep a detailed list of all expenses he has caused you (including incidents and when they took place).", "NTA he's an ungrateful freeholder, kick him to the curb.", "The dude is a mooch. Tell him he's gotta go, then send him a certified letter that he's gotta be out by X date, if you're in the US. When he twists it around and acts like you're the jerk, hand him a second letter with the full amount of arrears he owes, including utilities, and tell him if he wants to stay then he's gotta pay. \n\nDo not feel bad, because he doesn't feel bad taking advantage of you. At all.\n\nThen hopefully you learn your lesson from this. Generosity is a great trait, but you need to protect your money, property, and sanity. If you ever decide to take a roommate again, you'll know to sit down together first and put expectations and boundaries in writing as a lease/agreement of stay. Even with friends you're helping out.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHe is absolutely taking the piss out of you. Kicking him out is the right way to go. You\u2019ve given him enough chances.", "NTA\n\nIt is good you finally have the clarity of vision and courage to kick him out.\n\nHis lack of empathy or consideration or respect means you have to protect yourself from him in spite of your historical friendship. He doesn't deserve anything more from you.", "Info - how do you owe him money if you had to reduce the rent/bills so he could afford it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Furnace went out so I rebuilt it, he bought the broken bits, but I took my 2-4 hours after work every day taking it apart and cleaning it, assembling it, and reinstalling it. $300 total My water heater cracked due to a lack of hammer arrestors on the washing machine. I paid for half of that and installed it myself. $1100 total.\nHe was supposed to help me both times to learn how to do these homeowner specific tasks but instead chose to play LoL or WoW all day. After working 8-12 hours I don't want to continue working. I don't want to be the disciplinary person to his kittens. I want to come home and rest.", "That doesn't include other shit. He had an arborist dump mulch in my driveway, which blocked my gate wide open. He didn't offer to rectify the issue. I got quotes to have it moved with a bobcat. $2000, 4 hour minimum. I owe him surplus rent. $1550.", "I held on for companionship. I grew up in a small town in Kentucky. Everyone I grew up with is a drug addict or a white suburbanite who thinks they're hood. I didn't want to be alone, but my cat is my child, and I have to make absolute decisions for her well-being. I am her advocate, support, shelter, and defense. He can disrespect me, but he can not disrespect her. He was on thin ice after stunt 2.", "I have not.

I lowered it to reflect his increased share in the cleaning duties.", "My mother and I are filing an EPO and having him removed ASAP. As soon as he gets up and unblocks my car, we are headed to the court house. I'm not speaking with him because he threatened me through my mother, who tried to arbitrate. He thinks sweeping once a month and doing the dishes is sufficient. I also remembered another item he damaged, my Snapware from Costco. He boils noodles in them and warps them so the lids don't seat on the sealing surface.

Yes it's annoying that he broke the dryer and he's responsible for making that right. But the water heater and the furnace have nothing to do with him as a tenant unless he's the one who broke them.  You are responsible for providing and maintaining the heating system and the plumbing on your own. \n\nAsking him to let the repairman in is one thing, asking him to pay for and provide parts for the appliances is actually illegal.", "I seriously don't understand how you can possibly owe this mooch money, but you do whatever you need to get rid of him.

You are a better man than I on that.", "I completely understand your thinking i grew up from a small town too where all my friends were on drugs in jail and or pregnant by 16. Being alone is better than being mistreated by someone who doesnt respect you or your things. You deserve respect both you and your cat. When you have a history with someone it can be hard to letgo but you have to make the best decision for you and this decision shouldve been made before your animals got hurt. If he wasnt doing simple things like laundry correctly. no way you shouldve let him have animals. But im glad u removed him from the situation dont let him guilt trip you back", "I feel you. My BF and I kicked out our roommate last year\u2014 he was a friend of 10 years but a truly awful roommate who damaged our home repeatedly and never cleaned up after himself. We pay more in rent now without him subleasing, but honestly both our cleaning and incidental expenses have gone down significantly since he left. Plus you can\u2019t put a price on removing a major source of stress.", "I see. I still think he needs to go. You shouldn\u2019t be in a constant state of stress in your own home, just because of his antics.", "Perhaps once he leaves and you and your cat are safe you can sit down and add up how much he has cost you in broken damages. The bobcat you will need to pay for due to his error could be taken out of that money. Landlords use the security deposits to fix whatever the previous tenant broke. He was never your friend, just a selfish moocher. I'm glad your cat was found and is safely healing. Good luck and stay safe.", "Not really. Since I'm a live-in landlord, I can legally go without both hot water and heat.", "Mom agreed to petition the courts to remove him immediately due to his comments of violence toward me yesterday.", "No. He prepaid rent.", "My mother and him were talking just a few minutes ago and he threatened me with physical violence so Monday she and I will be taking ourselves to the courthouse to have him served with an EPO.

It's not good to be the most seen person in every room.", "In my state I can.", "That would be a negative amount.", "What state, Bullshitistan?", "then you don't owe him anything anymore. congrats!", "Huh. Looks like he owes you money then", "Kentucky. I have a lawyer and consulted him on these things. If I rented the entire house to him then you would be correct.
