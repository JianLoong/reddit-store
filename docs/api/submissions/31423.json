Please accept my admiration, too, for stepping up to take care of your dad at the end of his life. You had to make some tough decisions and it could not have been easy but it sounds like you did everything right and your dad was comfortable at the end. I am a retired healthcare professional and have seen dementia patients treated for diseases and watched them suffer more than necessary because they did not understand why people were hurting them, why they had to stay in the hospital when they just wanted to go home, why they were so sick, etc because their adult children thought they \"should try\". It is obvious that you were thinking of your dad and his level of comfort, providing him with excellent palliative care because you know that is what he would have chosen for himself. **You treated your father with love and respect. Continue to do just that and bury him next to your Mom so that he may rest in peace.** \n\nYour siblings need to \"get real\" - the amount of any payout from the asbestos in his lungs would not be enough to be worth the anguish if waiting for the autopsy, the autopsy results, the endless paperwork and documentation, etc. The fact that your dad smoked for 50 years would probably diminish the amount of any possible payout, too. Your siblings did not help with his end-of-life care or expenses and they are not going to be able to pull together all the necessary documentation without assistance from you so it would essentially be you doing all the work for filing the claim and you deserve a rest, a time to mourn the loss of your dad and let your body and mind rest and recover from what you have asked it to do over the last few years. Caring for a dying parent is tough physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Rest and relax now. \n\n**NTA**", "Absolutely THIS!!!", "Thank you. I just need to know I'm thinking clearly. I believe my siblings think it's all on me because \"I'm richer than them.\" But they're both doing just fine.", "Exactly. His smoking was the reason we didn't get a settlement when he was alive and diagnosed with COPD.", "honestly if it did go ahead I would personally make a list of all the expenses you incurred looking after him and insist they are covered before sharing any money. \n\nthat said you are very much nta. \n\nthe fact he lived so long would also likely affect any payout even if it was that kind of cancer. 86 is a good age. plus being a smoker & no longer of sound mind which isn't necessarily cancer related they would probably do a calculation etc. you wouldn't get much. \n\nyour siblings are greedy assh\\*les", "I went through something similar earlier this year when my dad passed in February.  It's unfortunate because autopsy decisions need to be made very quickly following the passing, and the longer you wait the more difficult it is to determine other things relating to cause of death. \n\nMy father passed from lung cancer and had a host of other health issues that we never got to the bottom of. My mom and I didn't really have an interest in having the autopsy done, but my brother really really wanted it done so he could have some understanding / closure of everything that was wrong with him, and maybe some information that could be beneficial to our own long-term health. We aren't seeking any sort of litigation with anyone, so there's no monetary witch hunt. Because of that, I agreed to support his decision and pay half of the autopsy cost (which was $3,000 for the county medical examiner, $3,000 for a private autopsy is IMO, a very good price) with him. I'm currently awaiting a FOIA answer from the county ME because I believe that the autopsy report was delivered to my brother but he didn't tell me. If that's the case I'm going to be very upset and hurt; even if I didn't want it done waiting every day for it to happen has taken a bad mental toll on me. \n\nI would strongly encourage you to allow an autopsy to proceed and sign off on anything that they want to sign off on, but will not be paying for it. If they want to take the financial risk vs reward on getting it done, that's up to them to do so, but you will also request that all money you spent on care be reimbursed before any remaining lawsuit funds be split between the family. NTA, by a mile in this case.", "It seems pretty clear they're just looking for a hand out. The only reason I could see to do this is if you had reason to believe it was asbestos and not his smoking that caused the cancer and wanted to try to recoup *your* losses. Since that doesn't seem to be the case, and your siblings didn't give a shit about the cancer until they thought they could profit off it, feel free to tell them to shove it.", "No kidding. If I were the defense attorney I'd be worse than the worst insurance company in hindsight."]}
