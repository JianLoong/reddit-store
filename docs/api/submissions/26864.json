I sleep in the living room on a fold up bed. I don't mind this arrangement because I didn't want to share a bedroom with my brother.\n\nMy brother is M15 and for the story we'll call him Tyler. Tyler has always wanted a pet and last year my parents caved and adopted a cockatoo, named Goldie.\n\nI don't know much about birds but Goldie has a pretty sad life. She lives in a big cage in Tyler's room where she spends most of her time. Tyler feeds her and cleans her cage but rarely takes her out to play or anything.\n\nMy parents are buying Tyler a new bed frame because his last one is wooden and it's become very mouldy. With the new bed frame, there won't be any floor space for Goldie's cage.\n\nEveryone just kind of assumed that I'd be fine with Goldie's cage being moved into the living room, but that's where I sleep and I don't want the bird there. Goldie can often be unsettled and really noisy during the night. I think this kind of noise would disturb most average people, it just so happens Tyler is a heavy sleeper and I'm a light sleeper.\n\nI brought this up and was adamant that I do not want Goldie in my sleeping space. I suggested that me and Tyler swap, I take his room and he takes the living room, but he doesn't want to give up his bedroom. Goldie going into my parents or my sisters room is out of the question.\n\nTyler was getting mad and said I'm being selfish and that it's not like his pet bird understands she'd be disturbing me. \n\nI was trying to walk away from the conversation because he was practically hollering at me and I was getting riled up but he kept following me. I lost my patience and yelled at him and told him he never bothers with Goldie anyway so he should just give her away to someone who will. Tyler screamed at me and shut himself in his room.\n\nOur parents understand my side and said they won't make me put up with having Goldie in the living room but if we can't work out a solution, she will need to be rehomed. \n\nI think this is the better option anyway but Tyler doesn't see it that way.

I suppose there is no garage, laundry room, patio or shed either. Why people who barely have enough space for the humans think its reasonable to add a pet to the mixture I don't understand.", "7 adult size people in a 3 bedroom house and your parents buy a large tropical bird??  I think your mom and dad are the biggest aholes in this sitch!", "NTA imo. Your brother is young and seems a bit entitled. Someone (ideally your parents) should probably have a tough conversation with him about how life works and how he has to make a choice. This is his pet bird and if he really wants to keep her, he can move into the living room. Alternatively, has anyone considered returning the bed frame?? They make those pretty affordable adjustable metal ones he can use instead. If you can't return it anymore, sell it on FB marketplace and get one that makes sense for the size of his bedroom? And if neither of these things can happen, Goldie may need to find a new home because you shouldn't have to lose sleep over it.", "NTA, your brother isn't looking after her properly no matter where her cage is. Birds need to be out their cages for a minimum of four hours a day, they need stimulation and because cockatoos are very clever birds, Goldie is probably slowly going mad.", "NTA, OP, apparently Tyler is choosing to have his own room over keeping Goldie. You report that Tyler ignores Goldie much of the time, other than ensuring she is fed & her cage is clean. Goldie might be far better off with an owner who bonds with her & cares more about her health and well-being. Tyler has made the choice.", "NTA- finding a good home for the bird is the kindest thing here.  Being shut in a room without any stimulation is just very sad.  Putting it in the living area is not the best idea either. Yes the bird is noisy, because the bird is bored and needs a home where people have knowledge about its care.", "NTA- can the cage be hung from the ceiling in brother's bedroom?", "Oh my god your house is a clown car. I think that your solution of you and Tyler swapping is probably the only conclusion where he can keep Goldie. The fact that Tyler is unwilling to compromise is definitely understandable, as change is hard and y\u2019all are in an awful situation, but you\u2019re still NTA", "Honestly your parents are the AH for buying your brother a pet bird. A kid cannot care for a bird well enough for that bird to have a good life. Birds are very social, very intelligent, and very curious. They need a ton of interaction and stimulation, and a kid/teen cannot provide that, and that shows with your brother. Whatever the case, you're NTA.", "NTA. Cockatoos are smart, that bird needs more attention daily than your bro's been giving it.  That he wouldn't trade for the living room to be with his bird is telling, and shows it's more a possessed thing than a priority.  Your parents at least are seeing the reality of the situation.", "NTA\n\nThat bird needs proper care and attention, and more space than just a cage small enough to fit in a bedroom!!\n\nFind somebody with a huge aviary who is looking for a new bird, and has time to give them attention, and let Goldie have a better life!!\n\nAlso, that brother's pretty entitled being the only family member to have his own bedroom and expect you to share your sleeping space with his noisy pet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Say \"bye-bye\" to the bird instead of giving the bird to your brother.  Guaranteed if the bird is in the living room, you brother would stop all care, cleaning, feeding, etc.", "NTA. It sounds like it would be better for Goldie if she was rehomed. As your brother isn't really doing much beyond the basics of cleaning and feeding her. That's not good for a pet. Which is why your brother shouldn't even have one if he can't put in more of an effort for her sake.", "NTA", "NTA Goldie deserves better", "NTA There are types of birdcages that can be rigged to hang from the ceiling. All you need is a ceiling hook and a chain the correct length. Problem solved! Goldie gets to stay in Tyler's room.", "NTA.  This is not on you.  It\u2019s your brother\u2019s choice.  He can choose if he wants to give up his bedroom or his bird.  He can not make you uncomfortable and have both.  You already have sacrificed for him to have his own bedroom.", "NTA but your parents are for getting an intelligent bird and allowing the bird to be in a cage all the time with no one that plays or interacts with her.  And your brother is for the same reasons.  \n\nI hope they find a good home for this poor creature, she has at least 25 years left and probably much more.  No one innocent should be stuck in the corner for 25-50 years of their life.", "Why can't Goldie be bought a new cage that can hang in Tyler's bedroom?  There are ways to put up bracket arms and get a bird cage that has a circle on top and can be hung from a chain.  Kind of like Tweetie in the old cartoons.  I don't think you are being an asshole.  But also, Goldie's cage can be covered at night to help her settle.  I have always had birds.  I have one and I know they can be noisy.  I also let her out daily to play with me and know they need attention and love and to be talked to.  I hope Tyler can keep Goldie because if he can't, he will be hurt, but you are not being an asshole for wanting proper sleep.", "I don't know, I do agree getting the bird in the first place was a bad idea. My parents weren't really that keen on getting Goldie (or any pet) anyway but they didn't expect her to live long. According to the woman they bought her off of, she is an older parrot and is 40 something.", "My parents don't really have a lot of money, they're intending on buying a used metal bed frame off Craigs list so unless they can find a a smaller one that's still cheap there's not gonna be much choice unfortunately.", "I don't know a lot about birds but I thought her being in her cage all day can't be good.\n\nTyler usually only takes her out to play for an hour or so on days he's not at school or if his friends are over. When he's cleaning her cage once a week, my niece will keep Goldie entertained which is where she gets most of her interaction tbh.", "a cockatoo in captivity can live up to 65 years, depending on species...", "That poor bird \ud83d\udc94", "That parrot is only half way through its life span. SO no only did your parents buy an bird, they did zero research on the breed.   Some cockatoos can live to 100.", "I'm sorry to hear that. It may be for the best if he insists on not moving to the living room to keep her then.", "My friend had a cockatoo that lived to be 105."]}
