I think your mom and dad are the biggest aholes in this sitch!", "NTA imo. Your brother is young and seems a bit entitled. Someone (ideally your parents) should probably have a tough conversation with him about how life works and how he has to make a choice. This is his pet bird and if he really wants to keep her, he can move into the living room. Alternatively, has anyone considered returning the bed frame?? They make those pretty affordable adjustable metal ones he can use instead. If you can't return it anymore, sell it on FB marketplace and get one that makes sense for the size of his bedroom? And if neither of these things can happen, Goldie may need to find a new home because you shouldn't have to lose sleep over it.", "NTA, your brother isn't looking after her properly no matter where her cage is. Birds need to be out their cages for a minimum of four hours a day, they need stimulation and because cockatoos are very clever birds, Goldie is probably slowly going mad.", "NTA, OP, apparently Tyler is choosing to have his own room over keeping Goldie. You report that Tyler ignores Goldie much of the time, other than ensuring she is fed & her cage is clean. Goldie might be far better off with an owner who bonds with her & cares more about her health and well-being. Tyler has made the choice.", "NTA- finding a good home for the bird is the kindest thing here.  Being shut in a room without any stimulation is just very sad.  Putting it in the living area is not the best idea either. Yes the bird is noisy, because the bird is bored and needs a home where people have knowledge about its care.", "NTA- can the cage be hung from the ceiling in brother's bedroom?", "Oh my god your house is a clown car. I think that your solution of you and Tyler swapping is probably the only conclusion where he can keep Goldie. The fact that Tyler is unwilling to compromise is definitely understandable, as change is hard and y\u2019all are in an awful situation, but you\u2019re still NTA", "Honestly your parents are the AH for buying your brother a pet bird. A kid cannot care for a bird well enough for that bird to have a good life. Birds are very social, very intelligent, and very curious. They need a ton of interaction and stimulation, and a kid/teen cannot provide that, and that shows with your brother. Whatever the case, you're NTA.", "NTA. Cockatoos are smart, that bird needs more attention daily than your bro's been giving it.  That he wouldn't trade for the living room to be with his bird is telling, and shows it's more a possessed thing than a priority.  Your parents at least are seeing the reality of the situation.", "NTA\n\nThat bird needs proper care and attention, and more space than just a cage small enough to fit in a bedroom!!\n\nFind somebody with a huge aviary who is looking for a new bird, and has time to give them attention, and let Goldie have a better life!!\n\nAlso, that brother's pretty entitled being the only family member to have his own bedroom and expect you to share your sleeping space with his noisy pet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like it would be better for Goldie if she was rehomed. As your brother isn't really doing much beyond the basics of cleaning and feeding her. That's not good for a pet.

There are ways to put up bracket arms and get a bird cage that has a circle on top and can be hung from a chain.  Kind of like Tweetie in the old cartoons.  I don't think you are being an asshole.  But also, Goldie's cage can be covered at night to help her settle.  I have always had birds.  I have one and I know they can be noisy.  I also let her out daily to play with me and know they need attention and love and to be talked to.  I hope Tyler can keep Goldie because if he can't, he will be hurt, but you are not being an asshole for wanting proper sleep.", "I don't know, I do agree getting the bird in the first place was a bad idea.

According to the woman they bought her off of, she is an older parrot and is 40 something.", "My parents don't really have a lot of money, they're intending on buying a used metal bed frame off Craigs list so unless they can find a a smaller one that's still cheap there's not gonna be much choice unfortunately.", "I don't know a lot about birds but I thought her being in her cage all day can't be good.\n\nTyler usually only takes her out to play for an hour or so on days he's not at school or if his friends are over.

Poor bird.", "NTA\n\nAnd your brother and parents are selfish for letti g him have a bird and a private room.", "Cockatoos can be very fun, affectionate companions. But they are messy as hell. It's no wonder his old bed is moldy. They scatter food all over. It's great for the environment when they live outdoors as it helps scatter seeds for several feet.\n\nThey are also incredibly noisy.

We have 4 small parrots and at minimum on work days we try to let them out at least 2-3 hours a day and most of the day on non work days. A few of our birds get bothered by light at night so we cover their cages with a magnetic breathable sheet (made for cages). Maybe with proper daytime stimulation and covering the cage at night would help with her behaviors. Birds are loud in general but should usually be quiet at night. \nAnother solution would be to get a smaller \"sleep cage\" for his bedroom that would fit and keep the larger daytime cage in another living space. \nRegardless it's not fair to have a noisy bird in your sleeping space. Your brother seems too immature to have a cockatoo.", "He's 15, of course he hates you. He hates everyone who doesn't implicitly agree with him, probably.
