I've been caught sneaking out a few times, I've mostly stopped because I know my dad doesn't like it but I did sneak out on Monday. Every time ive snuck out it was to go see my girlfriend(17f). I tried to find sort of a middle ground by being absolutely safe by ubering there instead of walking, but he didn't like that either. Then yesterday I got caught with a couple of grams of weed in my room that I took from my dad. As punishment I'm not allowed to use my phone or see my girlfriend for three weeks, and this includes chirstmas and new years. And no I'm not using my phone to type this I'm using my computer which I'm allowed to use. I think not being allowed to have my phone is fair, but I frankly I find not being able to see my girlfriend just cruel. I'm not asking to be ungrounded, I'm asking for a different punishment. I'm hole heartedly willing to sleep outside for the next month if it means I can see her. I have spent months working on her gifts, and the fact that I can't even give them to her on Christmas is heartbreaking. I've promised him I wont sneak out anymore or take weed from him anymore and I genuinely mean that. He's told me that I'm so selfish that it disgusts him all because I don't want to miss out on the holidays with my girlfriend. I have cried so hard that I threw up over this. I understand that I shouldn't have done what I did, but this punishment is crossing a line in my opinion. I find it absolutely cruel to use the most important person to me as a punishment. I finally have someone who I trust with everything, and he's using her as leverage against me. I would rather have him shave my head than have this. AITA for begging for a different punishment?", "created_utc": 1671329890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zonf1d/aita_for_thinking_my16f_dad41m_should_choose_a/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were asked not to sneak out to see this person and continued to do so. You stole from your dad as well. Three weeks of no phone and no going out with friends or girlfriends seems relatively light given the situation. You can give the gifts once your punishment is up and no, you should not beg for another punishment. \n\nIt also sounds like dad let the sneaking out go unpunished for awhile based on you saying you wouldn't do it anymore and you broke that trust. Breaking trust is a hard thing to get past. You additionally broke his trust by stealing from him.", "YTA - Grounded usually means not seeing people? You are grounded because of sneaking out and using marijuana as a minor.  \n\nYou can cry and complain but these are consequences for your actions.  What he's doing is called parenting.  I'm sure he doesn't enjoy this.  He cannot trust your word since you cannot even do him the courtesy of asking ahead of time to go out.", "Ahh teenagehood. Look kid, you\u2019re not an asshole for having feelings and wanting a different punishment. That\u2019s normal. Your dad isn\u2019t an asshole for saying no, absolutely not.  Where YTA is the dramatic fit you\u2019re throwing over this. Not being allowed to see the person you are sneaking out to see is a natural consequence of your behavior. This feels like the end of the world right now. I promise you it isn\u2019t. I hope once you\u2019re ungrounded, you and your dad find a way forward and you\u2019re able to see your girlfriend *and* make safe choices.", "YTA. Honestly if you're upset about this, that means the punishment is working. You should have never done the sneaking out or stealing weed. Like the sneaking out part I can get because you're young and you're gonna fo dumb crap all the time, but the first few times that you were caught you didnt learn your lesson and you kept doing it. If this punishment can get you to behave and actually think ahead before you do something dumb like sneaking out and stealing, then maybe your dad can trust you a bit more. Plus the punishment fits the crime anyway. You were sneaking out to see your girlfriend so no girlfriend.", "Info: why do you keep needing to sneak out to see your gf in general?", "YTA, you obviously learned nothing from lesser punishments in the past and have only yourself to blame now", "YTA \n\nBanning you from seeing the person you have been sneaking out to see is a perfectly appropriate punishment. Honestly I think he\u2019s being pretty lenient considering you have also stolen from him. Quit whining and start earning back trust.", "YTA. Punishments aren't meant to be \"nice\" or \"comfortable\". They are a wake-up call that your behaviour isn't acceptable.  \n\n\nDon't do the crime if you can't do the time.", "YTA. You've shown your dad he can't trust you, for sneaking out numerous times and for stealing his weed. You need to sort this out with him because he's the only one who can change the situation right now.", "Wow. Thank god I\u2019m not your mom. If I was, you wouldn\u2019t even have access to a computer.\n\nAsk away. I\u2019m sure your circumstances won\u2019t change. Make better decisions, kid. You need to learn from your mistakes.\n\nYTA.", "When I was a teen a bunch of us snuck out of a bowling alley without paying.  The manager recognized me because he knew my mom.   \nMy dad found us walking home and boy thr look on his face.   They grounded me for 2 months.   I deserved it.  \nI took it and behaved myself.  Never complained about it.   After about 5 weeks my parents wanted a sit down.  Dad who was an attorney said he was very proud of the way o took this.  He also knew none of the other kids were punished ( they called all the other parents ). I got off on \u201cparole\u201d for good behavior.  \n\nTry this.   Do better.  The advice about staying away from weed until you are older is spot on.    If you take this punishment with no whining you might be surprised.", "You know your father doesn\u2019t approve of you sneaking out and even taking Ubers is not totally safe\n\nClearly no other punishment was working \n\nYTA", "YTA, you fucked around and found out. \n\nLearn from this kid.", "YTA  You were sneaking out to see your girlfriend, so you are not allowed to see your girlfriend at all now because you couldn't just be respectful and visit her when you were allowed to.", "YTA.. as a repeat offender, to which you have admitted too, this punishment might make you finally realize you have to stop your behavior. \n\nHonestly, my parents would have extended that timeline to a lot longer than 3 weeks.\nDon\u2019t do the crime if you don\u2019t want to do the time. It\u2019s truly that simple.", "YTA, to be honest your dad took it a lot easier on you than I would have if I was your parent. You wouldn\u2019t be typing this on anything for starters, not to mention your hands would be full from all the extra chores I assigned you.", "YTA\n\nYour father wants the punishment to be effective. All your complaining shows him that it is having *some* effect. Only time will tell if it is having enough effect.", "YTA. As someone who got caught sneaking out during high school ONCE, I lost my phone for a month and was grounded for 3 months. Granted, it did make me a lot better at sneaking out after, but like, you got caught multiple times. If you\u2019re going to take that risk, you need to be prepared for the consequences. 3 weeks grounding is nothing and you lost your phone so you can\u2019t use it to facilitate sneaking out anymore. You gotta deal with it.", "YTA\n\nHe's picked the right punishment apparently, finally.  Looks like previous punishments weren't severe enough to get your behavior to change.", "I wish I could give you a hug right now because you sound like you need it.\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and get off of AITA. You\u2019re not going to find the answer you want here. You\u2019re just going to have people say unnecessarily cruel things to you while you\u2019re already down.\n\nLook, YTA. I think you know that. You fucked up multiple times and have given your dad no reason to believe that you are going to change your behavior. But right now, you have a chance to do better. Please take it.\n\nThere is a week until Christmas. Be on your best behavior. Don\u2019t give into the temptation to break the rules. And then sit down with your dad after some time has passed and ask him if he\u2019d be open to you meeting up with your girlfriend for an hour to exchange gifts. I have no idea if he\u2019ll say yes, but I think it\u2019s worth asking (calmly, with the understanding that the answer might be no).\n\nJust remember that your gf loves you. She\u2019ll love your gift even if she has to wait for it. You will make it through this even if it hurts.", "Welcome to the real world where stupid decisions get you punishments that you wouldn\u2019t like. They are put in place to teach you something. \n\nYTA because this is repeated behavior. Obviously you haven\u2019t learned anything previously so the punishment severity increases. \n\nDon\u2019t want it to happen again? \n\nStop making stupid decisions and stop sneaking out.\n\nActions speak louder than words. Don\u2019t make your promise an empty one. It will only make your parents trust you LESS. Actually do what you\u2019re going to say you\u2019re going to do.", "YTA punishment is supposed to suck and it fits perfectly. Had you listened and followed the rules you could still see her. You snuck out to see her and now you don\u2019t get to.", "YTA, friend. When you sneak out or do something you know you shouldn\u2019t be doing, part of that is accepting that if you are caught you will have to deal with the consequences. I think that based on what you did, it is a more than fair punishment.\n\nIn the future, I suggest trying to talk to your dad to figure out a solution to your problem BEFORE you try sneaking out. \n\nAnd I know weed is very common now, but come on. You\u2019re too young for that. It will still be there in a few years when your brain isn\u2019t literally still developing.\n\nYour dad wants you to be safe. You can earn his trust back by accepting your grounding and communicating with him better in the future.", "YTA and an idiot, this punishment is fucking light you must be spoiled and pampered all your life, also you\u2019re a liar cuz you keep saying you\u2019d stop but you haven\u2019t, def immature", "You keep on doing the same, you don't want to learn, so why should they believe you this time? YTA.\n\nYou are 16, not 8, learn that what you do has consequences :/ You've been together a few months, you can see her without sneaking out, honestly, its a good punishment. That relationship may not even work out. Are you willing to keep on getting punished because of a highschool relationship that will not last? Not worth it, think better, you are not a baby anymore.", "If you hound him over it then yeah YTA. You got caught, not to mention you are repeat offender, and stole from him. What do you expect? Im guessing all the other times you were caught you said you wouldn't do it again also. Personally I think you are getting off light. If I would have ever been caught sneaking out, I probably would have gotten 3 months at home and not 3 weeks and the phone would have been gone permanently. I would have also been forbidden from seeing the GF, because she would have been seen as a bad influence. \n\nAnd a little free advice, there is saying that nothing good happens after midnight. I always thought that was some garbage my mother made up, but when I finished nursing school and starting working nights in the ER, I found out there is some truth in it. Be smart, make good decisions, this isn't the end of the world.", "Soft YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s good your remorseful, and are promising to not do it again, but sometimes in life, you just have to live with the consequences. \n\nOffering to do a different punishment won\u2019t change his mind, and begging to see your gf will likely put your dad in a mindset where he feels the only way to retain control over you, and show he\u2019s serious is to uphold the grounding. \n\nIf you want to try to get back in his good graces, just lay low for a week or two and follow the rules. Don\u2019t make any plans for the holidays this year, stay in and do something he considers productive.  Don\u2019t ask for any big purchases between now and Christmas. \n\nIf he sees some genuine signs of remorse/self awareness from you (that aren\u2019t begging or offering to serve a different punishment), he might let up early. Key word might. Have zero expectations and be prepared to serve the full three weeks.", "YTA. This is a completely appropriate punishment. The reason you sneak out is to see your girlfriend so he knows the most meaningful punishment is to not see her. That\u2019s how this works. Now you will actually change you behavior. You\u2019re too young to see this as evidenced by your post but you will learn from this and that\u2019s the point of a punishment. Serve your time and change your behavior to avoid this in the future", "YTA. Punishments aren't meant to make you happy.", "YTA. Perhaps if you hadn\u2019t kept breaking the rules, you wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament. Your dad probably doesn\u2019t believe your promises of never doing  it again because you\u2019ve shown you can\u2019t be trusted. Unfortunately trust is hard to earn back.", "YTA it\u2019s a punishment, my friend. It isn\u2019t supposed to be fun, and this isn\u2019t your first offense. Think long and hard before you break your father\u2019s rules again.", "YTA. You know you are. Take the punishment and shape up.", "yta. The point of punishment is that you don\u2019t enjoy it so obviously this is a good one", "YTA.\nYour punishment matches the action.\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "YTA you fucked around and found out boo", "YTA. You\u2019re a sneak, liar, and thief. You are only upset that you got caught.", "Yea, YTA. The other punishments you mention are abuse. Very dramatic to prefer those lol.\n\nOh, to be young and naive again. Take it and learn moving forward.", "YTA. Actions speak louder than words - promises mean nothing if you've gotten in trouble before and still did it again and again. You're lucky that's the only  punishments", "YTA.\n\nPunishments should fit the 'crime'. You were sneaking out to see your girlfriend, so you're not allowed to go out and see her for a while.\n\nUse the landline, I assume you have one, talk to her on that. In the meanwhile, stop sneaking out on school nights. Set up proper times to go see your girlfriend, have her visit.\n\nIf you want to be so adult, to be treated more adult, then act more adult.\n\nIf you can't wait until your grounding is over to give her the gifts, either have someone mail then to her, or out them in a box and have her collect them from your front door.", "YTA. You're only sorry you got caught. And you're a thief too. You're lucky your punishment wasn't harsher.", "YTA You get to choose your behavior not your consequences. You repeatedly snuck out and then stole from him. Punishment isn\u2019t meant to be fun or what\u2019s convenient for you. Crying at this point is manipulative. You made these choices. Time to face the repercussions.", "Oh young love....YTA.  Frankly you got off pretty easy. You literally snuck out to see her early in the week, not being able to see her is a sound and just punishment. You need to sort your shit now, deal with the punishment and don't do it again", "Honestly, you are a teenager and I love it. This sounds so teen-y, like a english telenovela.  Just wait until you are 40, married, and your idea of a good night is giving some teen advice on reddit.\n\nI do think you should be allowed to drop off, driven and supervised, gifts to your girlfriend the day before Christmas, because, to you, this is strongest love in the world. \n\nHowever, I would suggest, you ask if she could come to your house and recieve the gifts and get 5 minutes, outside on the porch, to talk and hug. \n\nPresent both options, promise to do chores, and tell them some brainy quote you found that could hopefully indicate you have been doing some deeper thinking. \n\nOverall, YTA, but your parents love you and your behavior is reckless and scary. They see you going down a path and they would rather have an angry teen than no teen at all. \n\nShow them you care about their feelings (they are terrified when you sneak out) and you understand that the rules are there to protect you. If all else fails, ask if they can mail your gifts to your gf and write her long letters with tear-stains in the meantime. \n\nFinally, your emotions are a tad extreme, you are prone to risk-taking, all or nothing thinking, and needing weed at your age is a bit much. You may want to look into ADHD, PMDD, or other mental or spectrum disorders because that may be at the root of your behavior.", "YTA the crime and punishment are equal, sadly you don\u2019t get to say otherwise. And since you were sneaking out anyways sounds like you weren\u2019t supposed to be seeing your girlfriend and were breaking other rules", "You don't get to choose how you're punished for something you've been warned against before.", "You sound so much like the girl my oldest daughter dated a couple years ago. Childish, selfish, emotionally unhealthy. \n\nShe went through so much shit until she realized it was an unhealthy relationship for her and she's much happier now.\n\nI'm glad to see you're in therapy, and I would think you and your father would benefit from some family therapy.\n\nYTA for getting yourself into this position in tbr first place. You knew you were in the wrong but you kept it up.", "YTA, and you know what? Your girlfriend is too. Did she encourage you to sneak out? Red flag. Did she encourage you to bring the weed? Or were you just trying to impress her? Rules exist for a reason, and there is literally no good reason for you to be sneaking out of the house and stealing weed to go spend time with her. She couldn\u2019t even come and get you or see you safely home, which is the bare minimum even if you had been allowed to go. It\u2019s like she doesn\u2019t even care if you go missing. I never let any of my younger friends make their way home alone, ever. She\u2019s not safe out alone either to be far but you are 16, and your parent doesn\u2019t even know you are out of the safety of the house.", "Wtf....dude little dude....omgs u are for a rude awakening soon...live with it...accept the \"punishment\" and if ur gr can't handle it....well the ya f'ing know don't ya", "YTA.  Young lady, I\u2019d like to introduce you to the wonderful world of consequences.

Please for your sakes (and your gf, because this type of trauma can make people co dependent) tell another adult the whole thing here. Focus first in the whys and try not to get too emotional unless the adult shows you the space is safe. Sounds like dad needs a wake up call that your disobedience isn't just you being bad, it's you trying to stay connected with someone who makes you feel loved.", "YTA\n\nYou already showed that your words hold no value by sneaking out even though you promised you wouldn't, even if you are truly sorry and regret it the damage is already done, next time uphold what you promise so it doesn't happen again.", "You\u2019re getting off easy. When I got caught sneaking out I was grounded for six months. Six solid months. Take your punishment and be glad its not worse. I\u2019m sure not seeing her will be difficult.

This is good.", "Don\u2019t smoke weed until your brain is fully developed.  YTA", "YTA. Clearly you are only sorry you got caught. You sneaking out is nothing new, you have been punished before, you still did it. You are putting yourself at risk and taking drugs (or at least trying to).

Accept the consequences of your actions, learn from this, and move on. Your GF is equally responsible for this as It seems she either encourages or accepts this behavior even tho it is dangrous and silly to be sneaking out. Both of you need to simmer down, talk about how much this sucks, and move on. I get your young but this isn't the end of the world it's not even a hiccup.", " YTA", "YTA, you don't get to choose your punishment and maybe now you'll understand how serious what you did was. Consequences suck, be glad that he went easy on you.", "YTA your punishment is sound and it won\u2019t kill you to not see your girlfriend for a while just do a late Christmas. As someone who also did some stupid dangerous stuff as a teenager I also feel the need to warn you that taking an Uber doesn\u2019t make sneaking out any less dangerous. You could be in a car accident and unidentifiable, you could be grabbed on the street while you wait so on and so fourth. Your dad needs to know where you are and that you\u2019re safe. I know it feels like the end of the world right now but it\u2019s a small price to pay for the horror of not knowing where your kid is.", "YTA.\n\nHow many times have you already promised not to sneak out? You screwed up, you got caught. Accept the consequences of your choices.", "YTA, you knew you weren\u2019t supposed to sneak out. This is what happens when you make bad choices. Learn from this and don\u2019t do it again.", "YTA\nYou had chances to change your ways and still didn\u2019t.", "Yta - sneaking out means you are not following rules, the rules are there to protect you and teach you responsibility. You are trying to get around the rules and now not accepting the punishment for breaking the rules. You steal, you lie, you manipulate. If you want to be seen as more mature, learn the rules, show that you can accept responsibility.", "YTA. You choose to constantly break rules and you even stole from him. Lighter punishments don't work for you. This is a fair punishment. You don't get to be comfortable or happy with it. \n\nMaybe you'll learn to listen and not be a thief next time.", "YTA. Punishment is meant to deter you from doing this again, and this probably will. Getting a different punishment that you like kinda neutralizes the punishment.\n\nI\u2019d also urge you to think about your actions, and please don\u2019t take this as a lecture. It is clear your father loves you, and is trying to protect you. Sneaking out could have unintended consequences. Imagine if you got hurt or something terrible happened. An accident or a crime come to mind\u2014I bet your dad is terrified of this happening. Your dad is so scared he probably feels he must take drastic action because you have not listened in the past.\n\nSo it seems to me you are being punished not for going out but for doing it in secret.\n\nMost parents like to know where their kids are not because they want to control them or show up to spoil the fun, but because they have the means and the tools to protect the kids if they get in trouble. If they don\u2019t know where you are and you go missing between your house and your girlfriends house, how long until they figure it out?\n\nAccept your punishment and give your gf her gifts in January. Apologize to your dad, and don\u2019t do this again. Nothing good can come out of sneaking around.", "Yta, the thing with punishment is you don\u2019t get to pick it, the whole rather shave my head or sleep outside thing is dramatic and manipulative, but also you\u2019re 16 so in your point of view I\u2019m sure not seeing your girlfriend does feel like awful torture, but you\u2019ll survive.", "YTA. Know what else would keep you from seeing ur gf? Prison. It\u2019s your dads job to keep you from ending up there. Which is what he\u2019s trying to do. \n\nYou CHOSE to violate his rules. You already chose to be grounded with your actions.", "YTA. Take the consequences of your action, which honestly is a relatively light punishment anyway.", "Yeah...As a parent, YTA.  \n\n\nI would understand being upset if the this was the punishment for a first offense, but you said yourself, you've done this before.    \n\n\nIn this case the punishment fits the crime.  \n\n\nMaybe you'll figure it out this time around.", "YTA, don't do the crime if you can't do the time", "YTA, your punishment is reasonable. Grounding is a typical punishment for sneaking out, though stealing usually has a bigger punishment than just taking away your freedom for a few weeks and your phone. \n\nTake your punishment and learn from it. Next time you want to go back on your word to not sneak out or steal again remember this punishment and that it will likely be more time if you do it again.", "May I ask what you were expecting to happen if you got caught?

I got caught \u2018sneaking out\u2019 (I was trying to run away and it\u2019s the first and only time I ever left home without permission) and my windows got screwed shut and I lost my phone for a year. \n\nAlmost 10 years later and I recently discovered the windows are still screwed shut", "YTA, oh to be a horny teenager lmao. Been there, guy. Three weeks will be over before you know it. Sounds like your dad has his hands full with you lmao. The punishment fits the crime... sorry, dude", "YTA \n\nAlso, you snuck out? This is coming form a 22 year old that never got grounded or snuck out, did drugs. What were you thinking? I know for a fact I was grown up by the time I was your age and knew how dangerous it was. Ubering is NOT a middle ground. What you\u2019re doing is dangerous and how people get into serious, dangerous trouble. This is how you end up gone. That\u2019s how you end up NEVER seeing your loving family members or girlfriend again. Not to mention smoking weed. Really? The harmful effects to a under develop human brain! My brain still has time to develop so I\u2019m not even doing that even though it\u2019s legal in my state. I really hope this is a wake up call for you. Until you\u2019re 18, you\u2019re not in charge of anything about your well being.\n\nAlso, your dad is still being a push over.", "Awwww, most of us have been there. I got grounded for a month after sneaking out at 17. It feels like the end of world, but it's not, I promise you. Reframe this shitty situation as a positive and use your grounding as time to improve: work out, read/study, explore your passions, make your girl a handmade gift, etc. You fucked around and found out, my guy, so do the time and make sure you stay true to the promise you made your dad.", "YTA. \nAnd let\u2019s be real, you\u2019re gonna try and sneak out again to see her, regardless of this punishment.", "YAH.

When you are 18, and pay for your self, your phone, your own weed, your own Uber. Your own apartment. You can do what you want. Is this harsh? Most likely. But I do  not want you as co worker, a staff member, as an employee. If you\u2019re going to steal and sneak around. Don\u2019t do the crime if you can\u2019t handle the time.", "You effed around and found out.

If making a case for yourself isn't working, I agree with the replies that said to play it cool for a couple weeks, and to only share the sensitive emotional parts of your life with adults who show they are really hearing you.

I've been caught sneaking out a few times, I've mostly stopped because I know my dad doesn't like it but I did sneak out on Monday. Every time ive snuck out it was to go see my girlfriend(17f). I tried to find sort of a middle ground by being absolutely safe by ubering there instead of walking, but he didn't like that either. Then yesterday I got caught with a couple of grams of weed in my room that I took from my dad. As punishment I'm not allowed to use my phone or see my girlfriend for three weeks, and this includes chirstmas and new years. And no I'm not using my phone to type this I'm using my computer which I'm allowed to use. I think not being allowed to have my phone is fair, but I frankly I find not being able to see my girlfriend just cruel. I'm not asking to be ungrounded, I'm asking for a different punishment. I'm hole heartedly willing to sleep outside for the next month if it means I can see her. I have spent months working on her gifts, and the fact that I can't even give them to her on Christmas is heartbreaking. I've promised him I wont sneak out anymore or take weed from him anymore and I genuinely mean that. He's told me that I'm so selfish that it disgusts him all because I don't want to miss out on the holidays with my girlfriend. I have cried so hard that I threw up over this. I understand that I shouldn't have done what I did, but this punishment is crossing a line in my opinion. I find it absolutely cruel to use the most important person to me as a punishment. I finally have someone who I trust with everything, and he's using her as leverage against me. I would rather have him shave my head than have this. AITA for begging for a different punishment?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "This reminds me of that one scene in Teen Wolf, where the protagonists mom is struggling to figure out a punishment since the protagonist needs his phone for work and laptop for school. So she decides no best friend. \n\nESH, the punishment is very lenient imo. You\u2019ve said your father usually turns a blind eye, and from your other comments he\u2019s very\u2026 absent, negligent, in your life. Not a fan of his response to your attempt of communication. \n\nPersonally, not a big fan of minors using recreational drugs. I\u2019m not a bigger fan of you saying you stole it for your girlfriend\u2014 did she ask you to? If not, understand that you\u2019re distributing drugs to another minor. That has consequences. \n\nYou\u2019re apologetic for the stealing, but understand that he chose this punishment to teach you a lesson. Someone mentioned to sit down and talk with him, i agree with that, but I also know how some parents can be. My own mom said a similar thing when I tried talking with her about it as a teen. \n\nAll in all, he needs to be a better parent. Your punishment is sound. Your girlfriends mother is horrible and I can see a NC in the future.", "While I can sympathize, soft yta; not much of a punishment if you get to choose what it is. My advice is to be mature and accept it. Perhaps a demonstration of remorse and compliance will indicate to him you understand his concerns and make him more willing to sympathize with yours?\n\nYou mentioned you don't feel like he likes you/ he is unapproachable/ y'all don't communicate well/ etc. Maybe use this time to think about how to broach this subject with him and have an adult conversation? Went through something similar with my mom at 16yo, had to write her a heartfelt, well thought out letter (literally couldn't talk to her without her getting angry), and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. We finally got a chance to understand each other and it made things going forward much easier. Maybe worth a try? Either way good luck to you.", "I get it, as one that also used to sneak out to be with my boyfriend when I was your age. Looking back I wish I had a parent that was on me about it, because I could have very easily slipped into some shady things (and almost did).\n\nYou did not heed any previous warnings. You stole from him.\n\nI hope your father follows through, because it is what you need. I wouldn't trust you at all with your previous behavior, and honestly I doubt you can even make it through this punishment without violating his trust in you further.\n\nIf you can show some maturity and ACCEPT the consequences of your actions, I could see him letting you off early for good behavior - because you wouldn't even have the ability to write this post if you were my daughter.", "I\u2019m not gonna call you an asshole. Just misinformed. Children don\u2019t pick their punishment. If they did, you would still do what you wanted, knowing you could handle the consequences cause you picked them. It doesn\u2019t work like that. Your Dad is doing the right thing in his parenting.", "I don't think you're the asshole, but honestly it doesn't sound like your dad is one either. It sounds like you've put him in a desperate situation for what you clearly see as meeting a need. This punishment is something you're clearly going to struggle with. But I can promise you... You can handle it. It's going to be hard. But hopefully it'll lead to building trust with your dad, something that's clearly been lost for some time now.", "YTA play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "YTA. One word of advice though. Don\u2019t put so much importance on the actual date. It\u2019s not the date that matters, it\u2019s being with your g/f and showing her your love. It\u2019s going to be a special day, and your real Christmas,  no matter when it is. \n\nAs you get older and in more permanent relationships, many compromises will have to be made according to dates. It\u2019s the being together that counts, not the actual date. Just think how glad you will be to see her after all that time. Try to be positive and put a good spin on things. Your life will be much happier if you do.", "YTA\n\nThe punishment isn't crossing the line, it's getting your attention. That's the entire point. You weren't listening, you snuck out despite knowing it was against the rules, and you stole from your dad. Saying, \"I know what I did was wrong\" isn't good enough when you're lodging yourself into the, \"better to ask for forgiveness than permission\" mindset. You can say you won't do it ever again, but you likely said you wouldn't last time.\n\nReally, the only way to improve your situation is to stop haggling over your punishment and work towards being a more respectable young adult. Start with being someone your father can trust.\n\nAdditionally, you have a computer. Your girlfriend surely has a computer. Why do you lack any of the implements to make use of those to communicate with eachother? Discord is free.", "Soft YTA. I understand not being able to see your girlfriend over the holidays feels unfair, but I wonder if your father may feel that your gf is part of the problem. \n\nSomeone who truly cares about you, would discourage you from sneaking out.

You were told not to sneak out but you kept doing it. So you're just going to have to give her the gifts after Christmas", "YTA. Asked amd was amswered.  Just take the punishment and move on better.

You were sneaking out to see your gf therefore, the only reasonable punishment is to stop that. It's only 3 weeks. I know it sucks and it's hard. But hopefully you'll look back one day and see that he did this for you. I don't think you're an AH because you're a child and children like to see if they can push boundaries. You can absolutely request a new punishment but at the end of the day it's his right to say yes or no. He obviously said no, so the answer is no. He's not doing this to be mean, he is doing it because he loves you sneaking out these days is not as safe as it used to be. Take your punishment and let it go and for the love of your life stop sneaking out.

But I am not your dad and tho I find it hypocritical of him since he smokes (more so if he started in his early teens like I did) but at the end of the day I am not your dad and therefore, he parents the way he feels like and as long as you're not being hurt that's what matters.", "YTA you should have thought about the consequences before you took your dad's w\\*\\*\\* given you were caught sneaking out a few times. it falls on you girl maybe this time actually learn your lesson. \n\nyou do the crime you do the time!", "Huge YTA in this day and age it is absolutely stupid and dangerous especially for young women to go sneaking off without telling someone your plans.If something were to happen to you(God forbid) How do you think your Father would feel.You will understand this a lot better when you get a bit older and are responsible for someone else.Your Father obviously has not gotten his point across.I think now he is finally getting through to you just how important you are to him.", "YTA.

He sounds prickly but he doesn't sound like he's trying to prevent you from seeing your gf in general, so try to figure out how to do it on his terms so you stay in his good graces.  \n\nIf things are really rough at home, try talking to a guidance counselor at school (if you're not off for break already) -- they may be able to help you get some counseling which I think would really help.  Everyone needs someone to talk to!", "This kid is also on the cusp of legal adulthood where dad won\u2019t be able to say or do shit if she decides to leave him and go no contact. He sounds like an awful father given his reaction to her trying to tell him about her mental health, so I wouldn\u2019t blame her at all if she did.", "I\u2019m so sorry you experienced that, and I\u2019m glad you had a different perspective and better experience once you were out. \n\nHopefully Sgt Pirate Punk isn\u2019t raising children.", "But you said you won\u2019t sneak out again so how do you plan on having one on one time?", "Bingo. I\u2019m 18 rn and cut off my mother almost entirely and to op if your father is shitty as he seems to be just play the game till your old enough to get out of there that\u2019s what I did and it was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. Mental health should be priority number one", "I don't know that's the entire problem here"]}
