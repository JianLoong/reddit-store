He didn't abuse someone. He showed poor judgement and you were reimbursed.\n\nAlso, your willingness to \"scream\" and wake up your entire family to seemingly get to the bottom of what happened to makeup in the middle of the night is way over the top.

Are you and your wife always this uptight?\n\nRelax.\n\nThat was awful, but you should have just waited until the morning and had an adult converastion about it.\n\nETA: Just to be clear, I'm not saying you're wrong to be upset with Brian, but the fact that you'd drag that situation into your mother's wedding just makes you particularly petty. That is not the time. The wedding has nothing to do with you and you don't have the right to dictate how the rest of your family feels about Brian.", "YTA.  It\u2019s her day, not yours.

It was dumb and I\u2019d be pissed too if someone destroyed my markup but your wife was paid for it.", "YTA.\n\nWhen that particular prank was executed, Brian was the AH. When your wife discovered the prank, you & her were both AHs for dragging the entire family into it in the middle of the night on a family trip. Your mom paid Brian's AH tax, as she thought he couldn't afford it, and made it right. There was no physical harm, no emotional trauma, no ongoing threat...just a poor decision that turned out expensive, but reparation was made.\n\nThe situation at hand is your mother's wedding. You are emotionally blackmailing her by telling her that her son (you) refuses to be at her wedding if Brian (who she also considers a son by circumstance) walks her down. Unless you apologize, admit to her you clearly have emotional issues you need to address regarding her affection toward Brian (jealous? insecure?), and tell her you would like to share the honor and walk her down WITH Brian...you are definitely TA. \n\nBlows my mind resentment had gone this far... over overpriced makeup... that was replaced.", "ESH. \n\nThe prank *was* despicable and incredibly stupid. Unfunny, disrespectful and inconsiderate. \nHOWEVER, Is this honestly the hill you want to die on? Are you really willing to miss celebrating your mom\u2019s happiness over this? This is your mom\u2019s wedding. You might regret allowing a stupid and unfunny prank to come between you. \n\nBrian seems like he\u2019s got lots of maturing and growing up to do - and your mom will find that out the hard way. But you don\u2019t have any control over that. That is not your problem. Sometimes it\u2019s best to let bygones be bygones and let time teach the lesson.", "ESH Reading between the lines\u2026 it kinda seems like your mom doesn\u2019t really care about your wife the way she does about Brian. I\u2019m also going to guess that it bugs you that she treats him more like a son than she seems to do for you. Yeah your wife got paid for the makeup, but I\u2019m guessing your lingering anger is that your mom won\u2019t admit that he shouldn\u2019t have done it, that it was a big deal, and instead acted like you and your wife were the problem. I don\u2019t think you are the asshole for not going to a wedding, but that\u2019s not really what you are doing - you are trying to get your mom to value and like Brian less. And that\u2019s manipulative because there\u2019s no reason why she shouldn\u2019t bond with and love him as a part of her family. I don\u2019t know if you are ready for the consequences of skipping this event though. I hope you know - This isn\u2019t going to make your mom pick you over Brian. It\u2019s just going to cement him further in place as being her inner circle while you drift out. Instead, consider trying to talk to your mom about what\u2019s actually bothering you and remember, you can ask for a different relationship with her, but you aren\u2019t going to be able to control or change her relationship with Brian.", "YTA- this is your mom\u2019s wedding and you\u2019re behaving like a whiny baby.

Yes it was a dumb prank, and yes, you and your wife have the right to be mad about it. But are you really going to miss your mom's wedding just because you don't want to watch Brian take like a few minutes to walk your mom down the aisle?

Brian is not a good person and you should be no contact with him, but it's your mother's happy day. Don't focus on the 30 seconds he's even minimally in the spotlight, focus on the fact that you're there to celebrate HER and her stb husband. Don't let him get in between you and your family... that's just giving him power he doesn't deserve. Make him nothing to you... just ignore his existence.", "YTA, but read on because it's not all clear cut.  \n\\[edited because my feeble brain read years instead of months\\]\n\nWow. You've held all this anger for six months?\n\nI mean, I understand the initial anger. Personally, I HATE pranks, especially ones that involve destroying someone's personal property.\n\nBut it was six months ago and everyone except you (and I assume your wife) has moved on. Restitution was made. I don't agree with your mother making it -- it should have been her fianc\u00e9 since he's apparently the one who \"humorously\" suggested the Rolex in exchange for said prank. But whatever. That's something your mother and he have to work out for themselves.\n\nSo Brian has born the brunt of your anger over all this. You're not upset that your mom is marrying the dude who came up with the hairbrained idea of destroying your wife's makeup.\n\nLook, I can understand that you're pissed, but I'd be pissed at the dude your mom's going to marry, not just at Brian. But you don't seem to be bothered by him at all. Even though he took zero responsibility for instigating the entire situation and paid zero dollars towards the restitution. You didn't cut him out of your life, just Brian.\n\nWhich makes me wonder what else has gone on with Brian. Do you wish it was you who was walking mom down the aisle? Are you upset that your mom considers him as a son from another mother? Or are you just so invested in this six-year anger marathon that you can't see a way to drop the whole thing, even for a few hours to attend your mother's wedding?\n\nEither way, you need to find a way to get past this. Everyone else has (don't know about your wife) and this six-month harangue you're on is hurting you more than anyone else. I mean, beyond the wedding everyone else has simply gone on with their lives. Meanwhile, you've been walking around nurturing this resentment.\n\nLook, all of us have done things in our past that we regret and that were AH moves of some sort. No one is a perfect ray of sunshine. I certainly would not want to be judged forever by one thing I did that was stupid for this long. In this situation, no lives were lost. Restitution was made. Apologies were given (I hope). C'est la vie.\n\nDecide if you want to be there for your mother or not. Go or not. But cut Brian a little slack. You don't have to be best friends, you just have to tolerate him for one event. If it bugs you to see him walk down the aisle with your mom, look away or close your eyes, and be there for the rest of the wedding. Or not. I mean, after all, the dude who started the whole thing is marrying your mom and he never seems to have suffered any kind of consequence for his part in the whole mess that started the problem. <sigh>", "YTA. It's not your wedding and you're an adult. This is not the type of thing people break families up over.\n\nBe there for your family and know that you've taken the high road and keep your head high", "Apparently my mom's fiance offered to give him a Rolex but he claims the whole conversation was a joke and it isn't his fault that Brian was too wasted to get that.", "It was a few years ago, and my brother-in-law was always up to something mischievous.

First of all,your mom is a grown woman with grown kids,she doesn't really need anyone to walk her down the aisle. That is a tradition for a young womans first marriage and the father is\" giving the bride to her husband\". It really makes absolutely no sense for Brian to walk her down the aisle. I think that's weird. But,it's her wedding. But you have every right to feel the way you do. Why is your mom putting him over you( her own son) and your wife so much? You are not the asshole here. The asshole who ruined your wife's makeup and cost her 1000 dollars is the asshole here. P.S.   I see that it was your mother's fiance who bribed him to destroy your wife's make up.

Brian did something that wasn't just destroying makeup but it felt like a real violation (to have your stuff singled out and destroyed, then have people laugh about it) and NO one took accountability for the way that situation made your wife feel, and you feel. Brian went through her private items, gathered them up, and then physically destroyed them, and then had a laugh about it. It isn't about the makeup, it is about the violation. \n2. You love your mother and want to be there for her, but having Brian be pride of place at her wedding, after what he did, isn't something you can sit through. You have cut contact with him and can exist in spaces together, for her, but this is too much for you. \n3.
