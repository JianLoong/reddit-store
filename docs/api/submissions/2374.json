Again, he's gotten better but it's still there. He wanted a dog in foster care and couldn't have one so now he has one. That's how he's seeing it. He didn't take in to consideration her breed or temperament. She has a high prey drive and is nippy, even with us sometimes. We have bent backwards trying to train her but nothing appears to work.

In the first month of him getting Josie, I begged him to re-home her. My foster mom was a dog trainer and I know a thing or two about training and temperaments and I knew that given Josie's breed we were going to have troubles. He didn't listen, because he didn't want to abandon the dog just like he had been abandoned.

We had a place lined up months ago, who backed out due to the dog. Everyone else says we cannot bring the dog. We can't afford the other ones.

This isn't a punishment but more of a realization that you wouldnt give someone who gambles money. \n\nIf he can't manage his own money and wants to stop \"being poor\" then you may have to get more aggressive with controlling the spending", "NTA. Those kind of people needs to be shaken once in a while.

Dogs are not only emotional investment, they cost money and time.

On top of that, you can never truly know what you are getting with mutts, one can hope for the best but most of the times - it's poor outcome.

One, he didn't consult you when getting the dog, which isn't what you do to a spouse in a healthy relationship. Two, he hasn't offered another solution to avoid you all becoming homeless. And if you can't make payments, your credit score dives and it becomes even harder to get a place. Your husband is being a huge asshole. Either he gets a second job or the dog goes. Sadly animals aren't people and sometimes their temperament makes it impossible to live with them.

He most certainly shouldn't have gotten the dog in the first place, but you waited a year for the two to bond before throwing it in his face and now it's too late. You should've put your foot down as soon as you came home, because(assumedly) you know your husband and supposedly this breed would become an issue. \n\nI understand how difficult it is denying the person you love the ability to show compassion towards another creature, I really do. My ex grew up in the system and tried to do the same thing with a dog after we had been dating for a little while. I had to pretty much tell him all the reasons he would be a terrible pet owner if he got a dog right then it hurt him, but its what had to be done for him to get that the pet isnt just a prop for him to feel better. For him, it was partially that he never could have a dog growing up, but also he felt he had the power to make a creature's life better than his growingup. It seems like your husband needs to get to the point where he understands that he does control whether it's life is better, or worse, but both of those aren't necessarily with the two of you. If you are homeless, starving and destitute, you won't be much help to a dog. Alternatively, I'd go homeless, starve and give all of my blankets to my dog, as long as it meant she lived happily next to me until we both die, so I get where he is coming from at this point. \n\nWhile he was the OG AH in a huge way(theres no reason to go deeper, than you dont impulse buy a living fucking animal), not intervening sooner is making you a huge one now. The dog and your husband now have a strong bond that will likely shatter both of them, if faced with loss of the other. Good luck to all of you, but mostly to that poor dog being stuck in the middle.", "ESH.  I\u2019m sorry, were you just in stasis for the entirety of this dog selection process?  Apparently not, since you \u201cknew\u201d this breed was a bad pick, and yet didn\u2019t put your foot down while there was still time to do something about it.  \n\nYou two are allegedly a team.  If you don\u2019t trust his decision-making abilities, and don\u2019t consider that enough of a dealbreaker to walk away, figure out how you\u2019re going to navigate that *together*.

She tried so hard, she was an angel, but she was now BIG. And our six month old cat was not. She spent the weekend with us and we gave her all the love we could but I knew I'd made a huge mistake. She nipped at the cat twice and then picked her up by the scruff and shook (lightly, but still). She messed in the house repeatedly (not her fault at all, fosters had a mud room thing she apparently went in regularly at night and she was nervous in the new place) and could not be left alone for more than about a minute, I'm talking going to the bathroom and shutting her out was not acceptable and she'd whine.\n\nI never blamed her.

You have an animal that needs to be walked daily, perhaps multiple times a day. It needs to be housetrained, or else will just pee and poop on the floor. It might chew on stuff, and can do a lot of damage depending on size. If you work long hours, that can be a problem (potty incidents, chewing, barking).

If you can't afford the woman's home on your own, look for a room to rent.

Now she did make life hard for the first two years of her life but as she ages and we keep the training up she is a really great dog especially out somewhere.", "Yea and you put your fucking foot down and get the dog out of there.", "BS. Where are heelers, or dachshunds, or heeler/dachshunds, or whatever she\u2019s claiming considered an aggressive breed and excluded from all leases?", "$30 was because OP said the power bill was cheaper than feeding the dog.\n\nShe starts the post by talking about how humble she is and how horrible her foolish husband is then her solution is to chew out her husband. Remember, this question isnt asking to rehome the dog, this question is asking if shes an asshole for chewing out her husband\n\nNowhere in any of this has anyone even mentioned hubbys feelings about the dog other than to demean him.", "which is not that fucking easy when your spouse has fucking issues and you can\u2019t afford to live alone, jesus christ.", "Wherever shes living i guess? Id assume they're applying for cheaper apartments,and those from my experience dont want dogs at all.", ">$30 was because OP said the power bill was cheaper than feeding the dog.\n\n  \nAnd I'm saying it might not be feasible. Some dogs get sick from the cheap stuff (and the ingredients are more harmful in the long run). So again, that's an issue of quality of life vs affordability. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He says I'm an AH for making him feel like shit for refusing to re-home his dog. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd still say NTA for this because at this point he needs to accept the facts and rehome the dog. She's right. He fucked up and put them in a bad spot, they'll be homeless soon if they keep it. \n\n\"Chewing him out\" was not the solution. She's been pushing for the solution for almost a year. He sprung a dog on her without consulting, didn't take into account difficulties with this breed, then seems to have left training up to her and in fact excuses its bad behavior (like biting people). HE is doing wrong by his spouse AND the dog, but refuses to step up to the plate here. \n\nSounds like she's currently dealing with constant stress from all of this and having to hear him whine about the situation he put them was the breaking point for her. I don't blame OP at all for losing it, everyone has a breaking point.", "Life ain\u2019t easy. This is a hill you die on when you can barely afford basic necessities.", "She wrote \u201cdue to her prey drive.\u201d Not \u201cdue to being a dog.\u201d", "yes because that\u2019s entirely her fault", "What\u2019s the rental market like where you live? In my city they would never find a place. Ever! Mainly because places are renting within hours and landlords can be picky as hell. \n\nI would be so pissed if I was married to this guy. He created their current situation and it\u2019s ridiculous to think his decisions didn\u2019t directly put their living situation in jeopardy."]}
