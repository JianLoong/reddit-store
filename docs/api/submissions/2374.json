I shouldn't have said it but was I wrong in saying it? \n\nMy husband and I both grew up in foster care and developed two completely different attitudes due to it. I'm humble, problem solving, generally positive and a glass half full type of women. He is a \"life is out to get me\", \"it will never get better\", glass half empty type of man. Not always! Please don't take this as me bashing him. He HAS gotten better with the help he gets in therapy but those moments where he collapses and goes back to his negativity is hard. He has a lot of good days now and things have been getting better but recently he had a personality shift again. \n\nNow.. back about a year ago he got himself a dog. Her name is Josie and she is a Heeler/Dashaund (I didn't spell that right, sorry). I wasn't exactly in on this decision but I wasn't surprised because he impulse buys/spends and generally doesn't think before acting when it comes to these impulses. Again, he's gotten better but it's still there. He wanted a dog in foster care and couldn't have one so now he has one. That's how he's seeing it. He didn't take in to consideration her breed or temperament. She has a high prey drive and is nippy, even with us sometimes. We have bent backwards trying to train her but nothing appears to work. And now.. due to her prey drive.. we are having a hard time being accepted in to any other apartment/house and we are on the verge of eviction after a steep increase in rent ($550 increase so now we are paying $1600 for a 1 bedroom, nothing included). In the first month of him getting Josie, I begged him to re-home her. My foster mom was a dog trainer and I know a thing or two about training and temperaments and I knew that given Josie's breed we were going to have troubles. He didn't listen, because he didn't want to abandon the dog just like he had been abandoned. And now, due to this, we can't find another place to live and we are slowly going completely broke paying rent here. We only have $26 to last us until next week and do not have rent money for next month. \n\nHe started complaining real heavy yesterday and I will admit my tone and attitude was unlike me. He was saying he is sick of living in poverty and was tired of never having money and I have heard this far too many times. So I told him we live in poverty because he made the poor choice of getting an aggressive dog with a high prey drive and refusing to re-home her because of his abandonment issues. We had a place lined up months ago, who backed out due to the dog. Everyone else says we cannot bring the dog. We can't afford the other ones. He says I'm an AH for making him feel like shit for refusing to re-home his dog.

When you are a child the world can be a dangerous place for some and he needs to get out of that space.", "He says he's sick of living in poverty, but went out of his way to get a dog? Let's see...common costs of owning a dog: food and treats, toys, grooming, vet visits, annual shots, anti flea/tick/heartworm meds, dental procedures, boarding if you're out of town, etc. Oh yeah and we're in the middle of an inflation crisis, so the cost for all of these is skyrocketing.\n\nNTA", "Nta at all.

You (and he) are not currently at that stage that you can afford to keep a high maintenance pet. He needs to give up the dog for re-homing. \n\nSometimes you simply have to tell it like it is. Some people need to hit rock bottom before they realise they have to change. No, you are NTA.", "NTA... It's time to re-home the the dog, for the dogs benefit and for yours. \n\nAs for your husband he needs a firm kick in the rear and possibly you need to withhold his ability to make financial decisions until he is more capable. This isn't a punishment but more of a realization that you wouldnt give someone who gambles money. \n\nIf he can't manage his own money and wants to stop \"being poor\" then you may have to get more aggressive with controlling the spending", "NTA. Those kind of people needs to be shaken once in a while. If you want to spend the rest of your life with this man, you need to be honest with him and make him understand why is way of handling money impact both of you negatively.", "NTA. You simply told him the truth. He\u2019s been complaining about this for a while, and one of the big contributors to the two of you not having money is his choices (and his refusal to do anything about those choices). It\u2019s time he faced those facts, and the fact that his choices have consequences for other people: mainly you. \n\nSure, he may now feel like shit, but feeling like shit may be what he needs to wake up and see what he has done.", "NTA What does he suggest you do about the math?

Sorry OP.", "NTA. \n\nPeople who struggle with impulse control also seem to struggle with understanding that their actions have consequences. \n\nIt's not fair to any of you (including the dog!) for him to project all of his trauma and issues onto the dog, especially coming at the expense of a place for you to live. \n\nNot to mention, it sounds like Josie needs a different living environment all together - with either a big yard to run in or someone who has the time and ability to take her on lots of long walks, not to mention someone who knows how to handle her and train her appropriately. It would be kinder to her to find her a home that's more suited to her needs and temperament. \n\nIn any case, you're not the asshole here. Ask him what his plan is when you run out of money and can't pay rent - where will you move to? How will you get back on your feet? If he doesn't have actual, realistic answers for this then he needs to face reality about this entire situation, and fast.", "NTA. He wasn\u2019t able to take a responsible choice of not buying Josie. He can\u2019t properly take care of her.

The truth hurts for those that don't own their mistakes and poor decisions.  If he doesn't start thinking about the end result before acting, he's never going to change.", "NTA. Dogs are not only emotional investment, they cost money and time. And it was an impulsive and stupid of him to get a dog when you weren't 100% on board and he did not do proper research on what he is getting. On top of that, you can never truly know what you are getting with mutts, one can hope for the best but most of the times - it's poor outcome. I think rehoming the dog is a reasonable request considering your financial and living situation. A dog won't solve his abandonment issues nor his inability to spend money wisely.", "NTA, but what is your plan?", "NTA- and I don't get this idea that we can't actually tell people the truth because they won't like it. That's bollucks. He needs to man up and accept that he has caused this. If he refuses to own the problem then it's obvious that he won't own the solution.", "NTA. Your husband shouldn't make impulse purchases when money is tight. And an animal should never be an impulse purchase, ever!", "NTA.\n\nYou're going to have to give the dog up if you're homeless. Also, what happens if this dog has a medical emergency and needs immediate veterinary care?\n\nI'm sorry you're in this position. The dog really does need to be rehomed. Keeping her until a severe bite incident occurs because she's not receiving formal training is a good way to sentence her to death. You should work on finding a local rescue who is willing to take on and invest in a nippy dog, which will be better off for both you and her in the long run. \n\nIt sounds like your husband needs to be in regular therapy. I know that's easy to say and often challenging to find resources for. But putting the literal roof over your head AND this dog in jeopardy because of his mental health issues really isn't okay.", "not the H. Sounds like you just spoke the truth and he\u2019s too busy wallowing in self-pity to admit his mistakes", "NTA and cut him loose. Move out.", "NTA. This is a rotten situation, your husband sees himself in the dog and doesn\u2019t want to \u201cgive up on it\u201d. But you\u2019re not equipped to take care of any dog, let alone this dog. It\u2019s quickly come to the point of this is no longer a decision but a necessity. Is there anyway to soften this blow for him? Do you have any friends who could take the dog in? Can you make an agreement that after a b and c happen that you both will go and adopt a dog together?", "NTA I love dogs but he should've never gotten that dog. I understand that he had a rough upbringing and that he's in therapy but he's an adult and it feels like he's using his past as a crutch.", "Oh course your not the asshole! One, he didn't consult you when getting the dog, which isn't what you do to a spouse in a healthy relationship. Two, he hasn't offered another solution to avoid you all becoming homeless. And if you can't make payments, your credit score dives and it becomes even harder to get a place. Your husband is being a huge asshole. Either he gets a second job or the dog goes. Sadly animals aren't people and sometimes their temperament makes it impossible to live with them. You gave it your best reasonable effort.", "A pretty small part of a dog\u2019s behavior is due to its breed. The vast majority is due to training and the particular dog\u2019s temperament. Are heelers, or dachshunds, prohibited breeds where you live?\n\nIt\u2019s a bad idea to jump into a dog without having everyone on board. \n\nIt\u2019s a bad idea to overstate how much of the problem is due to the dog. \n\nESH.", "ESH. He most certainly shouldn't have gotten the dog in the first place, but you waited a year for the two to bond before throwing it in his face and now it's too late. You should've put your foot down as soon as you came home, because(assumedly) you know your husband and supposedly this breed would become an issue. \n\nI understand how difficult it is denying the person you love the ability to show compassion towards another creature, I really do. My ex grew up in the system and tried to do the same thing with a dog after we had been dating for a little while. I had to pretty much tell him all the reasons he would be a terrible pet owner if he got a dog right then it hurt him, but its what had to be done for him to get that the pet isnt just a prop for him to feel better. For him, it was partially that he never could have a dog growing up, but also he felt he had the power to make a creature's life better than his growingup. It seems like your husband needs to get to the point where he understands that he does control whether it's life is better, or worse, but both of those aren't necessarily with the two of you. If you are homeless, starving and destitute, you won't be much help to a dog. Alternatively, I'd go homeless, starve and give all of my blankets to my dog, as long as it meant she lived happily next to me until we both die, so I get where he is coming from at this point. \n\nWhile he was the OG AH in a huge way(theres no reason to go deeper, than you dont impulse buy a living fucking animal), not intervening sooner is making you a huge one now. The dog and your husband now have a strong bond that will likely shatter both of them, if faced with loss of the other. Good luck to all of you, but mostly to that poor dog being stuck in the middle.", "ESH.  I\u2019m sorry, were you just in stasis for the entirety of this dog selection process?  Apparently not, since you \u201cknew\u201d this breed was a bad pick, and yet didn\u2019t put your foot down while there was still time to do something about it.  \n\nYou two are allegedly a team.  If you don\u2019t trust his decision-making abilities, and don\u2019t consider that enough of a dealbreaker to walk away, figure out how you\u2019re going to navigate that *together*.  Don\u2019t just stand there or make snarky commentary or tentative suggestions from the sidelines, and then go all \u201cI (could have) told you so\u201d once things are past the point of fixing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But the impulse decision to get a dog without my knowledge (he didn't tell me he was getting a dog and I came home to it after work) and then not rehoming her to a family or a couple with a yard or with proper money and abilities to train her is 100% the reason why we will not have a place to go.
