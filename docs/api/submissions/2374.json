Her name is Josie and she is a Heeler/Dashaund (I didn't spell that right, sorry). I wasn't exactly in on this decision but I wasn't surprised because he impulse buys/spends and generally doesn't think before acting when it comes to these impulses. Again, he's gotten better but it's still there. He wanted a dog in foster care and couldn't have one so now he has one. That's how he's seeing it. He didn't take in to consideration her breed or temperament. She has a high prey drive and is nippy, even with us sometimes. We have bent backwards trying to train her but nothing appears to work. And now.. due to her prey drive.. we are having a hard time being accepted in to any other apartment/house and we are on the verge of eviction after a steep increase in rent ($550 increase so now we are paying $1600 for a 1 bedroom, nothing included). In the first month of him getting Josie, I begged him to re-home her. My foster mom was a dog trainer and I know a thing or two about training and temperaments and I knew that given Josie's breed we were going to have troubles. He didn't listen, because he didn't want to abandon the dog just like he had been abandoned. And now, due to this, we can't find another place to live and we are slowly going completely broke paying rent here. We only have $26 to last us until next week and do not have rent money for next month. \n\nHe started complaining real heavy yesterday and I will admit my tone and attitude was unlike me. He was saying he is sick of living in poverty and was tired of never having money and I have heard this far too many times. So I told him we live in poverty because he made the poor choice of getting an aggressive dog with a high prey drive and refusing to re-home her because of his abandonment issues. We had a place lined up months ago, who backed out due to the dog. Everyone else says we cannot bring the dog. We can't afford the other ones.

This isn't a punishment but more of a realization that you wouldnt give someone who gambles money. \n\nIf he can't manage his own money and wants to stop \"being poor\" then you may have to get more aggressive with controlling the spending", "NTA. Those kind of people needs to be shaken once in a while.

Dogs are not only emotional investment, they cost money and time.

On top of that, you can never truly know what you are getting with mutts, one can hope for the best but most of the times - it's poor outcome.

One, he didn't consult you when getting the dog, which isn't what you do to a spouse in a healthy relationship. Two, he hasn't offered another solution to avoid you all becoming homeless. And if you can't make payments, your credit score dives and it becomes even harder to get a place. Your husband is being a huge asshole. Either he gets a second job or the dog goes.

He most certainly shouldn't have gotten the dog in the first place, but you waited a year for the two to bond before throwing it in his face and now it's too late. You should've put your foot down as soon as you came home, because(assumedly) you know your husband and supposedly this breed would become an issue. \n\nI understand how difficult it is denying the person you love the ability to show compassion towards another creature, I really do. My ex grew up in the system and tried to do the same thing with a dog after we had been dating for a little while. I had to pretty much tell him all the reasons he would be a terrible pet owner if he got a dog right then it hurt him, but its what had to be done for him to get that the pet isnt just a prop for him to feel better. For him, it was partially that he never could have a dog growing up, but also he felt he had the power to make a creature's life better than his growingup. It seems like your husband needs to get to the point where he understands that he does control whether it's life is better, or worse, but both of those aren't necessarily with the two of you. If you are homeless, starving and destitute, you won't be much help to a dog. Alternatively, I'd go homeless, starve and give all of my blankets to my dog, as long as it meant she lived happily next to me until we both die, so I get where he is coming from at this point. \n\nWhile he was the OG AH in a huge way(theres no reason to go deeper, than you dont impulse buy a living fucking animal), not intervening sooner is making you a huge one now. The dog and your husband now have a strong bond that will likely shatter both of them, if faced with loss of the other. Good luck to all of you, but mostly to that poor dog being stuck in the middle.", "ESH.  I\u2019m sorry, were you just in stasis for the entirety of this dog selection process?  Apparently not, since you \u201cknew\u201d this breed was a bad pick, and yet didn\u2019t put your foot down while there was still time to do something about it.  \n\nYou two are allegedly a team.
