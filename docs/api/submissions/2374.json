Her name is Josie and she is a Heeler/Dashaund (I didn't spell that right, sorry). I wasn't exactly in on this decision but I wasn't surprised because he impulse buys/spends and generally doesn't think before acting when it comes to these impulses. Again, he's gotten better but it's still there. He wanted a dog in foster care and couldn't have one so now he has one. That's how he's seeing it. He didn't take in to consideration her breed or temperament. She has a high prey drive and is nippy, even with us sometimes. We have bent backwards trying to train her but nothing appears to work. And now.. due to her prey drive.. we are having a hard time being accepted in to any other apartment/house and we are on the verge of eviction after a steep increase in rent ($550 increase so now we are paying $1600 for a 1 bedroom, nothing included). In the first month of him getting Josie, I begged him to re-home her. My foster mom was a dog trainer and I know a thing or two about training and temperaments and I knew that given Josie's breed we were going to have troubles. He didn't listen, because he didn't want to abandon the dog just like he had been abandoned. And now, due to this, we can't find another place to live and we are slowly going completely broke paying rent here. We only have $26 to last us until next week and do not have rent money for next month. \n\nHe started complaining real heavy yesterday and I will admit my tone and attitude was unlike me. He was saying he is sick of living in poverty and was tired of never having money and I have heard this far too many times. So I told him we live in poverty because he made the poor choice of getting an aggressive dog with a high prey drive and refusing to re-home her because of his abandonment issues. We had a place lined up months ago, who backed out due to the dog. Everyone else says we cannot bring the dog. We can't afford the other ones.

This isn't a punishment but more of a realization that you wouldnt give someone who gambles money. \n\nIf he can't manage his own money and wants to stop \"being poor\" then you may have to get more aggressive with controlling the spending", "NTA. Those kind of people needs to be shaken once in a while.

He most certainly shouldn't have gotten the dog in the first place, but you waited a year for the two to bond before throwing it in his face and now it's too late. You should've put your foot down as soon as you came home, because(assumedly) you know your husband and supposedly this breed would become an issue. \n\nI understand how difficult it is denying the person you love the ability to show compassion towards another creature, I really do. My ex grew up in the system and tried to do the same thing with a dog after we had been dating for a little while. I had to pretty much tell him all the reasons he would be a terrible pet owner if he got a dog right then it hurt him, but its what had to be done for him to get that the pet isnt just a prop for him to feel better. For him, it was partially that he never could have a dog growing up, but also he felt he had the power to make a creature's life better than his growingup. It seems like your husband needs to get to the point where he understands that he does control whether it's life is better, or worse, but both of those aren't necessarily with the two of you. If you are homeless, starving and destitute, you won't be much help to a dog. Alternatively, I'd go homeless, starve and give all of my blankets to my dog, as long as it meant she lived happily next to me until we both die, so I get where he is coming from at this point. \n\nWhile he was the OG AH in a huge way(theres no reason to go deeper, than you dont impulse buy a living fucking animal), not intervening sooner is making you a huge one now. The dog and your husband now have a strong bond that will likely shatter both of them, if faced with loss of the other. Good luck to all of you, but mostly to that poor dog being stuck in the middle.", "ESH.  I\u2019m sorry, were you just in stasis for the entirety of this dog selection process?

If you can, move out until he can sort himself out.", "NTA\n\nBut why are you still putting up with this behavior? He knows it's wrong and that it's not in the dog's best interest, it's not in your best interest, and it's not even in his own best interest! But here he is, making you *homeless* trying to prove something to himself.\n\nHe sounds self-destructive. The negativity, the self-sabotage, the refusal to reverse a bad decision. If he's aiming for destruction, he will succeed. And he will drag you down with him. \n\nMight be time for some distance. Let him figure shit out. You're not going to change him, all you can reasonably do is take care of yourself.", "You can try rehoming your husband", "NTA. He needs to grow up.", "You two and the dog are in the middle of the ocean and there is a piece of drift would that barely keeps you two afloat. If he grabs the dog you will all likely drown. If he is not going to save both of you, save yourself", "His choice affects you profoundly.   He can complain, but you cannot?  He doesn't get to force you into a miserable situation and then demand that you pretend it is ok.  His actions are causing the problem.  SAYING that the emperor has no clothes doesn't strip him naked.  Edited to say the way you were handling it didn't work.  Hope speaking up does.  NTA", "When he says \"I'm an AH for making him feel like shit for refusing to re-home his dog\", tell him \"He's and AH for making you homeless, shit would feel good compared to what that's going to feel like\".", "How can you be an AH when it's the truth? Your Husband put his whole families stability in jeopardy because he impulse brought a stressful breed of dog. And now he's making it your fault. NTA", "NTA but I\u2019m going to raise an unpleasant question: how much longer can you afford to keep your husband with his current habits? It sounds like you all only have a few days left before homelessness a real risk. I think it\u2019s time to let him know whether you\u2019re willing to be homeless with him, or whether you\u2019re going to proceed with securing affording housing for yourself and will comply with whatever requirements are needed for that and if he wants to join you he\u2019ll need to comply as well. If he\u2019s unwilling to meet the housing requirements for a place you can afford, you don\u2019t plan to join him on the streets.", "NTA, but you are part of the problem, sadly. You are the problem solver married to a man who is and will pull in problems like a magnet with his attitude and impulse decisions. And he got used to you solving all the problems for him. He maybe gets better with this stuff, but as long you continuing solving all the problems, he maybe sees why its bad what he is doing, but he doesn't feel it so he doesn't completly understand it. \n\nI'm usually highly against ultimatums, but this man will get you broke and make sure you stay broke (bc everything is so bad and the world is against him, and thats how he wants it to be, bc if not he can't be the victim anymore). I would tell him he has 2 months to find an affordable apartment where you can bring the dog or you will move w/o him or if you get evicted you will only search for a solution for yourself. I know its harsh, but you guys will fail in the long and short term if you both keep up with your behaviour. I know you want to \" save\" him and somehow also making up for his bad childhood, but with that you allow him to have a unfair treated child mindset forever and you will not only be broke after realizing you can't save him on your own you will be so burnt out, that its gonna be hard to land on your feets again.", "NTA\n\nBut - this is more a training issue than the dog outright being a \"bad\" dog.  Although, without training, she will end up a bad dog.\n\nDaschunds and Heelers are BOTH high energy \"working\" breeds.  Very smart.  They need a ton of activity and interaction, or they will turn into shits just out of boredom.\n\nWe adopted a standard schnauzer, and at first, she was very bitey and nippy when playing.  Took a while, but taking her for walks and interacting with her got her out of the biting habit.", "Exactly this. Dogs are great to have, but they are a huge responsibility (not only financially)\n\nIf OP is struggling to feed themselves, then I am concerned about the wellbeing of the dog. The dog deserves to be placed in a home that can cater to it's needs.", "Strongly agreed. All relationships have their problems but I wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who puts my life at risk for a non-need and acts like a victim when they dig themselves deeper into a risky situation.", "Not the right answer.", "Jesus.. it seems like this sub has only one solution", "Yeah but it doesn\u2019t seem like that is 100% of their money problems, from reading the post it seems like their problems right now are due to housing issues with the dog", "There\u2019s an easy way to rehome the dog.., rehome the husband with her. \n\n\nBut seriously OP. His poor choices are keeping you from having a roof over your head. Is this the kind of stability that you pictured for your life? You\u2019ve worked hard for the life you want\u2026 are you going to let him make you homeless?", "Pardon my bluntness, but have you considered that your husband is to you what the dog is to your husband? He won't rehome the dog, so he may have to sink with her and you won't rehome the husband, so you may have to sink with them.\n\nI'd suggest taking care of yourself first and maybe when there is no more safety net that you provide, your husband will come to view the situation in a more pragmatic manner.", ">The dog is a red herring - youd be having this argument with or without a dog\n\nHow?", "Because OP is acting like this one apartment is her only hope. But thats not how this works. That apartment will raise its rent and theyll be right back to where they are in 6 months.\n\nThe problem is contempt, not a dog. OP even says its hubbys decision-making that is causing the problem. Shes still gonna be mad at his decisions with or without a dog.\n\nP.S. it doesnt cost that much to feed a dog. I have a 140 pound dog that I could feed for less than 30 per month if I had to buckle down", ">Because OP is acting like this one apartment is her only hope. But thats not how this works. That apartment will raise its rent and theyll be right back to where they are in 6 months.\n\nDid you read the post? They've applied to *multiple* apartments and houses. All of them have rejected them *due to the dog.*\n\nThey are facing homeslessness due to not being able to find affordable housing due to a No Pets policy. Not because feeding the dog is too expensive."]}
