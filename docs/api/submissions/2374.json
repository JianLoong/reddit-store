I wasn't exactly in on this decision but I wasn't surprised because he impulse buys/spends and generally doesn't think before acting when it comes to these impulses. Again, he's gotten better but it's still there. He wanted a dog in foster care and couldn't have one so now he has one. That's how he's seeing it. He didn't take in to consideration her breed or temperament. She has a high prey drive and is nippy, even with us sometimes. We have bent backwards trying to train her but nothing appears to work. And now.. due to her prey drive.. we are having a hard time being accepted in to any other apartment/house and we are on the verge of eviction after a steep increase in rent ($550 increase so now we are paying $1600 for a 1 bedroom, nothing included). In the first month of him getting Josie, I begged him to re-home her. My foster mom was a dog trainer and I know a thing or two about training and temperaments and I knew that given Josie's breed we were going to have troubles. He didn't listen, because he didn't want to abandon the dog just like he had been abandoned.

So I told him we live in poverty because he made the poor choice of getting an aggressive dog with a high prey drive and refusing to re-home her because of his abandonment issues. We had a place lined up months ago, who backed out due to the dog. Everyone else says we cannot bring the dog. We can't afford the other ones.

This isn't a punishment but more of a realization that you wouldnt give someone who gambles money. \n\nIf he can't manage his own money and wants to stop \"being poor\" then you may have to get more aggressive with controlling the spending", "NTA. Those kind of people needs to be shaken once in a while.

Dogs are not only emotional investment, they cost money and time.

On top of that, you can never truly know what you are getting with mutts, one can hope for the best but most of the times - it's poor outcome.

One, he didn't consult you when getting the dog, which isn't what you do to a spouse in a healthy relationship. Two, he hasn't offered another solution to avoid you all becoming homeless. And if you can't make payments, your credit score dives and it becomes even harder to get a place. Your husband is being a huge asshole. Either he gets a second job or the dog goes.

He most certainly shouldn't have gotten the dog in the first place, but you waited a year for the two to bond before throwing it in his face and now it's too late. You should've put your foot down as soon as you came home, because(assumedly) you know your husband and supposedly this breed would become an issue. \n\nI understand how difficult it is denying the person you love the ability to show compassion towards another creature, I really do. My ex grew up in the system and tried to do the same thing with a dog after we had been dating for a little while. I had to pretty much tell him all the reasons he would be a terrible pet owner if he got a dog right then it hurt him, but its what had to be done for him to get that the pet isnt just a prop for him to feel better. For him, it was partially that he never could have a dog growing up, but also he felt he had the power to make a creature's life better than his growingup. It seems like your husband needs to get to the point where he understands that he does control whether it's life is better, or worse, but both of those aren't necessarily with the two of you. If you are homeless, starving and destitute, you won't be much help to a dog. Alternatively, I'd go homeless, starve and give all of my blankets to my dog, as long as it meant she lived happily next to me until we both die, so I get where he is coming from at this point. \n\nWhile he was the OG AH in a huge way(theres no reason to go deeper, than you dont impulse buy a living fucking animal), not intervening sooner is making you a huge one now. The dog and your husband now have a strong bond that will likely shatter both of them, if faced with loss of the other. Good luck to all of you, but mostly to that poor dog being stuck in the middle.", "ESH.  I\u2019m sorry, were you just in stasis for the entirety of this dog selection process?  Apparently not, since you \u201cknew\u201d this breed was a bad pick, and yet didn\u2019t put your foot down while there was still time to do something about it.  \n\nYou two are allegedly a team.

She tried so hard, she was an angel, but she was now BIG. And our six month old cat was not. She spent the weekend with us and we gave her all the love we could but I knew I'd made a huge mistake. She nipped at the cat twice and then picked her up by the scruff and shook (lightly, but still). She messed in the house repeatedly (not her fault at all, fosters had a mud room thing she apparently went in regularly at night and she was nervous in the new place) and could not be left alone for more than about a minute, I'm talking going to the bathroom and shutting her out was not acceptable and she'd whine.\n\nI never blamed her.

You have an animal that needs to be walked daily, perhaps multiple times a day. It needs to be housetrained, or else will just pee and poop on the floor. It might chew on stuff, and can do a lot of damage depending on size. If you work long hours, that can be a problem (potty incidents, chewing, barking).

If you can't afford the woman's home on your own, look for a room to rent.

My parents had to explain to me how happy our dog was (living at the beach with loads of room to run, and it wouldn\u2019t be fair to him to take him from that for a tiny fenced yard - that because we loved him, letting him stay was the right thing.  I\u2019m generally opposed to rehoming because most stories I hear are about convenience.  But when it is best for the dog, you have to consider it.  Being broke is bad for all of you, and small apartments are rough on some dogs in particular.

Is a dog really worth the harm that you will surely suffer and the irreparable breakdown of trust between you two? A partner did this to me once. Luckily he didn't impulse buy a dog but his financial decisions and bridge burning were pretty disastrous. We nearly became homeless because of the things he was doing and while I was lucky to be working, the way he took everything out on me really made it difficult.
