But it seems like all you wanted was a private apology, and she couldn't even manage that.\n\nThis teacher seems to have an overdeveloped sense of self-righteousness that I've seen in some other teachers and administrators. The sad thing is that it reduces respect for the good teachers and makes their job harder.

He called the teacher childish, then acted childish himself.\n\nYes he taught his son that he has his back. That\u2019s great parenting.

As a parent, you did great supporting your son but not at all as an adult talking to a professional in their workplace who has a much better idea of what is happening. She should have already in the situation realized the names got switched around (outside of teachers, I don't know anyone who knows 140-160 people's names and personal details and favorite colors and learning needs and growth potential and ugh, exhausted trying to think of it here). You don't need to go bashing on the teacher in front of your son or getting worked up on the issue either. It was, in the end, a misunderstanding that got blown out of proportion, and everyone's energy became heated and directed at a nonissue. Teachers are used to hissy fit parents, so I kind of get her viewpoint, but she also should have been able to sort it better. She definitely should apologize to your son, but that shouldn't be demanded of her either (she probably would have if not immediately confronted, and I'm guessing words were said by you OP that you're not sharing). Imagine if every time you make a small mistake you have to have meetings and someone's angry parents yelling at you. Your kid sounds like a great kid, and your're awesome for standing up for him, but rarely do we need to degrade a whole profession due to one small moment.", "ESH\n\nBoth sides are at fault here. Mrs B not apologizing is a bit rude, but not a huge deal. Her saying kids \"have short memories\" is the big red flag that's the issue \n\nYou bringing up her not apologizing and escalating it wasn't smart, either. Sure, receiving an apology would've been nice, but not fully necessary. By outright saying \"apologize to my kid\" paints as much fault on you as Mrs B.

But this lady is something else.", "My year 7 science teacher didn't like it when I told her she was wrong in using a dolphin as an example of a fish.

She berated a child in front of the class and said she should call the resource officer. Resource officers are actual police officers assigned to schools with the authority to arrest people.\n\nDisciplinary actions should be handled privately if it is anything more than asking a kid to stop distracting behavior.

There should be evidence and further investigation. \n\nThis teacher owes more than an apology.", "Yeah, kids absolutely do not have short memories. My kindergarten teacher spanked me for patting my foot during music, and I still remember her name, her face, the classroom, etc. Not sure what I had for breakfast yesterday, but that witch I remember.", "Yeah OPs kid will be 56 and will remember this story of this shitty teacher.", "Cannot upvote this enough. Former teacher here, and completely agree. We owe it to our students to own up to our mistakes and sincerely apologize (publicly!) when we're wrong. In the U.S., at least, we could definitely use more of this. The inability to admit mistakes is an embarrassing cultural trait.\n\nObviously NTA, OP, and good for you for keeping a level head.", "The fact that there are no consequences for a dumbass teacher actually warrants calling them stupid. Call them out. Why must the parent hold back just to be polite when a teacher knows they can be an asshole due to their tenure and get away with it like they most likely did many times before this incident.", "I absolutely agree.  This notion that because someone is an adult, they need not apologize when they make a mistake or hurt a child is fucked.  Adults are meant to teach by example.  And the example being taught by this sort of behaviour is that - I'm bigger and more powerful, so I can treat you how I like.  In other words: bullying.  Apologizing doesn't diminish authority.  It shows that no one is ever perfect and that owning up to mistakes is the right thing to do.\n\nI do not remember a single adult apologizing to me.no matter what happened.  It did not teach me any good lessons.  I have to make a conscious effort to remember to apologize for things when it isn't just social convention (I'm Canadian, so there are apologies that are not really apologies that almost everyone gives).", "Please.\n\nYou'd file a lawsuit and police report if your boss falsely accused you of vandalism and theft in front of your coworkers.", "She doesn't get to do my son wrong and not apologize.", "I was direct with her and she clearly felt she was above accountability.

They can be stupid and vindictive bastards just like anyone else.", "Teaching my son that people in authority can be stupid is not a bad thing.", "Mrs B yelled at a child with no proof and when she found out the truth, refused to apologize, even privately.

That is something he will respect when he's older.", "Calling out a person in a position of power when they are wrong isn't disrespectful. And I don't care if she has 500 students.

My son learned that I have his back and this emotional teacher got checked.", "No she won't.", "First off, I didn't degrade an entire group. I said that some teachers are stupid and you know that is true. Are you saying that all teachers are good?\n\nSecond of all, don't play the teacher card on me. They get into that profession knowing what they're getting into. That's like a cop defending all cops, good and bad, by saying their job is tough. Plenty of people have tough jobs.", "He didn't degrade a whole profession though, just an individual that made a mistake.", "Is it normal for teachers to threaten middle school students with actual police intervention before they know all the facts? You know what a resource officer is, right?", "Actually, not apologizing to a child after screwing up and causing problems for them IS a huge deal. Dad is not wrong for demanding apology and repair. It\u2019s bare minimum when you wrong somebody. Kids deserve and need that basic respect. Dad creeps into asshole territory with name calling because it\u2019s simply not helpful.

Dad needs to take it to the school board.  This is wayyyyyyyy not okay.  This just makes my blood boil.\n\nYes, the teacher should be forced to apologize to the child IN FRONT OF THE CLASS, the same place she called him out.  The principal needs to apologize to the dad for not enforcing it.  And it alllllll needs to be discussed in front of the school board.  If either of them refuse, the Board needs to take appropriate disciplinary action.  \n\nWhile I have the absolute utmost respect for teachers, ones like these make the great ones look bad.\n\nNTA.  But they are government employees and they work for YOU.  We need to have the elected school board hold them accountable.

I remember in my credentialing program one of the mentor teachers would say she was \"testing\" the kids when she made a spelling mistake. She would say, \"oh, I was seeing if anyone would catch it.\" I thought it was stupid. Making mistakes and owning them humanizes you to students.", "Absolutely agree. If you can accuse someone in public you can damn sure apologize in public.

And it sounds like you met one of those (because I have A LOT of questions about her atm). Thing is, as parents we ride the wave between our kids and school, and showing your kid at that age especially this stuff leads to questioning things in an unhealthy way (and demolishes trust between everyone). In the end I think the child shouldn't have witnessed any of this conversation, because it seems like it became ugly on both ends.", "\"even teachers can be stupid\" does make sense - but I'm reading between the lines here that the confrontation overall became as heated as it was.

How is it OK for a teacher to humiliate a child in public and get away with it? \n\nEveryone who has a job is overworked. Thats not an excuse.
