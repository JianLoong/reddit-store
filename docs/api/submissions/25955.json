And that speaks volumes about the kind of person you are - genuinely generous with your time and energy, and surprisingly easygoing about a thoughtlessly inappropriate request.\n\nBut despite the fact that you're okay with putting the work in, it still kind of IS about the work required to make all that food, and not just about the extraordinary amount of food she's asking you to make for just two meals for two people. Because while she knows that you WILL do it . . . that doesn't make it any less selfish of her to ask in the first place.\n\nTwo incredibly labour-intensive, time-consuming meals might not be an ENTIRELY unreasonable or inappropriate ask for a very special occasion, like a birthday. But in this case, she is asking you to spend literally HOURS in the kitchen just to prepare these two meals . . . all because \"she has cravings\"? Most people, when they have cravings, might ask a BF to run out to the store to pick up a single treat. They don't expect him to spend hours upon hours whipping up multiple involved recipes - much less multiple MEALS - from scratch in a single day. \n\nSeveral people have mentioned the word \"entitled\", but I'm not sure that fully covers the scope of this. I think the concern here is that, while you insist that she understands the work that goes into all this . . . she really doesn't care. She believes that it's not a big deal to ask you to do all that work \"because craving\". It is, in a word, GREEDY. It is the epitome of \"taking advantage\" of you: using your skills to fulfill her every whim, and not considering what it costs you in time and exhaustion. You are NTA, but I'm very concerned that you're letting her treat you like a personal food machine.", "OP read what you just wrote. She won\u2019t learn to cook but expects meals to be made for her. And not just meals, but everything from scratch (even a damn ice cream cake?!?) That\u2019s a big ask multiple meals in a row. Then when you point out that\u2019s a lot of prepared food one right after another she immediately accused you of commenting on her weight. Which you in no way did. Now she is not speaking to you while still expecting you to make her food from scratch. Is this your girlfriend or your toddler? \n\nAdults communicate and form a plan together. Toddlers demand chili dogs then chicken sandwiches and fries then ice cream cake. Adults learn to cook meals themselves or try to help their partner in the kitchen. Toddlers insist it be made for them on their timeline. Adults understand portions and wastefulness. toddlers have meltdowns, stomp their feet and refuse to speak until they get what they want. And finally- adults accept apologies and understand their partner is on their side, toddlers don\u2019t stop fussing till they get what they want. \n\nYou are NTA, but good luck with your toddler.", "You're NTA. That is honestly a lot of food. I can understand, because my eyes are sometimes too big for my stomach as well, but it doesn't sound like you said anything nasty or made any sort of comment about her weight. That is a LOT of stuff to ask someone to cook for them - I would be appalled if anyone made that large of a request from me, unless they were terminally ill or something.", "NTA\n\nWhat an ungrateful, spoiled, self-absorbed brat. And you made this person your girlfriend. \n\nYou can do better. You should do better. Do better.", "Unless this is for some kind of special occasion, this is a ton of food. I love food, so I get it - this menu also sounds amazing... but there's a huge sense of entitlement here asking someone to make this much food for just 2 people for just 1 day. \n\nNTA\n\nSince you're doing all of the work, and it's a lot of work, you could make the executive decision to just make one of these things. Maybe make the other item another day. That'll limit the time you spend in the kitchen each day, but you'll both still get to enjoy.", "NTA - She's demanding so much and you're right, that's a lot of food that might go to waste.", "NTA. Not only demanding a whole crapload of food, but being overly dramatic if you make a sensible comment. You feel \"a little unappreciated\" because you are. Time for a conversation.", "Maybe she is acting this way because she does not realize the amount of work that goes into making all that food. Maybe she is acting this way because she is sensitive about her weight and eating habits. Either way you are NTA but if I were you I would not be doing all the cooking by myself anymore. Cooking is a basic life skill and she needs to learn so she can be more reasonable in her expectations of others. Alternatively, she can go and pay a professional chef in a restaurant to cater to her.", "NTA. She sounds spoiled and ungrateful. Maybe she should get off her arse and learn to cook for herself if she\u2019s going to be a pain about the food and how much you think is reasonable to cook.\n\nI\u2019d have a conversation with her to tell her this and that her behaviour is rather entitled and rude.", "Youre not the AH - that is literally so much food, and so much work, and if its not eaten, so much waste and money thrown away on it.\n\nShe needs to look at it from that perspective. My hubby and I noticed we\u2019d make big meals and there were tons of leftovers and we\u2019d have family constantly wanting new meals every day but the leftovers remained. And ultimately we threw out so much waste. We eventually made the leftover rule, we dont make new meals until weve attempted to eat the leftovers a few times.\n\nShe needs to be an active participant in prepping/ making meals to understand how time consuming it is, and she needs to help clear out leftovers, and clean out the fridge if there is any remaining", "Good God man stand up for yourself. You don\u2019t deserve this treatment NTA", "NTA  Girlfriend needs to learn to cook for herself!", "NAH. So something I've found from cooking and dating people who cook myself is that there is a serious expectations gap between people who are Serious About Cooking and people who aren't, and this causes major problems of understanding even between people who really care about each other and want to do everything right. So for example:\n\n**Casual home cooking:** Chili dogs? No problem. Take out a hot dog, grill it in the toaster oven, dump some canned chili in a pot, maybe chop some onions into it, add a couple spices to tinker, put that all on a bun and maybe add some cheese, you have a meal. \n\n**Serious home cooking:** First I'll need to make the chili, this will require simmering down meat, probably chopping real meat, adding beans for three to four hours at just the right temperature in addition to everything else I will do...\n\n**Casual:** Broil chicken breast, chop potatoes and throw them in an air fryer, put on bread.   \n**Serious:** As you said, you're brining chicken. Maybe you'll make some aioli for the sandwich, or season the fries...  \n\n\nDo you see how these two are very, very different amounts of time and labor and also very, very different portion amounts? With the casual cooking, all of these recipes can be adapted individually to the individual people eating it. So one chicken piece per person, one hot dog, one small can of chili for two people, etc. With the serious cooking, you don't waste that much effort for small portions. So you're thinking it's a lot of food and for you it would be - but when you say \"that's a lot of food\", you're implying to her way of thinking that her eating two normal size meals is eating too much food - that's an easy ticket to disordered eating anxiety.", "Do you live together?  If not go home and let her feed herself", "INFO\n\nHow does she go out of HER way to do nice things for YOU like she expected you to do?\n\nBecause it sounds like she makes a ridiculous demand and expects you to silently comply.

Hot dogs, make however many , freeze rest for next week.  Chicken, cook one or two breasts. same deal.   freeze some of the buns, you'll have two sizes.  forget making dessert, go out for icecream.  \n\na couple potatoes, french fries are easy to control portions.    no waste.  \n\nI would try meeting her demands, but she better bring the gratitude later ,or have a conversation.", "NTA...

I welcome suggestions for meals, even some polite input when it's not someones favorite meal, however I do not take meal orders and I dont waste food. \n\nShe is manipulative, and a passive aggressive bully. \n\nShe needs to learn to discuss things without taking offense AND she needs to learn to cook.\n\nYou need to grow a spine.", "NTA.

I do a side catering hustle, and my dad has a culinary degree and I would need at least 2-3 days' notice for 2 full meals and an ice cream cake.

She can take herself to 7-11 and buy an ice cream bar.\n\nDon't let people ask too much of you, get pissed, make YOU the problem and then ignore you.

I would eat all of that fucking food.", "NTA She wants you to make three different time consuming dishes? For ONE day?? That's crazy man. I've made homemade French fries before and that takes na hour minimum, chili and hotdogs isnt terrible I guess and neither is chicken sandwiches...but homemade ICECREAM CAKE??

D*mn. \n\nNTA but as many have said, her behavior is concerning. Aside from all the things mentioned already, I am over here hung up on the silent treatment. Then you went to the store *alone* to buy the groceries for the meals she wanted and you\u2019re feeling \u201ca little unappreciated?\u201d You are perfectly allowed to feel that way, because you are being a lot unappreciated. I recognize this is just a snapshot of your relationship together, but if one innocent remark (not unfounded either, imo) sets her into name-calling and pouting, even after you apologized, then perhaps you can see why people are judging her more harshly than you might. You seem to have inadvertently highlighted a number of concerning attitudes and behaviors from her, and she seems to be showing a surprising lack of maturity or understanding or even any gratitude.

In addition to two slightly involved homemade meals? All for one day?", " Nta but she definitely is.

I just don't know how you can get from \"I feel like that's too much food and we won't eat it all\" to \"you eat too much\". They're pretty diametrically opposed statements.\n\nEdit to add: I do think asking for 2 homemade, completely from scratch meals plus a dessert in one day is asking you to do a lot of labour. No doubt about that. I'm just curious about the \"a lot of food\" statement because a chili dog for lunch and a chicken sandwich with fries for dinner seems fairly normal to me and maybe that's where her brain leapt to the \"you eat too much!\" assumption since you mention in a comment she's been feeling down about her weight lately.

Maybe your gf doesn\u2019t understand, maybe she just doesn\u2019t care, but treating you like a short order cook and getting mad when you tell her it sounds like too much to do in a day is a bit concerning. Try to reiterate to her that it\u2019s not about how much she\u2019s eating, it\u2019s the fact that she thinks she wants all this food and then it\u2019ll go to waste because y\u2019all might decide you don\u2019t want chili and chicken sandwiches for the next three days.", "Demanding, looks for criticism in what you\u2019d say about her, ignores you. \n\nShe\u2019s a bit much, and you\u2019re gonna tell me my comment is?

Yeah, 45mins is REALLY easy when you are enjoying the time and not focused on a chore", "Well that could be part of the problem why she asks for so much food? Maybe its a communication issue where she thinks its not a lot of work involved or you genuinely enjoy it?", "Are you currently afraid to give instructions to your girlfriend because you\u2019re afraid of her reaction when you tell her what to do?  Of course you are. This is true for many couples. \n\nI recommend that you shouldn\u2019t try to teach her until she\u2019s done a bunch of meals on her own.

She offered to help but I declined because I felt like having to explain/watch her is more trouble than its worth when I could just do it myself, like I said she doesn't know how to cook really.

Remaining chilli you can eat the next day as leftovers or freeze, and a chilli dog isn't exactly a huge meal, buy those hotdogs in a jar and eat the rest another day. A sandwich and some fries you can just buy enough supplies to portion out for that single meal. And ice cream as a dessert, any leftovers could be frozen. It sounds like a reasonable amount of food for a day's meals to me. EDIT: Saw you said ice cream cake, not just ice cream. Make smaller individual cakes rather than one big one to avoid waste.\n\nI mean, also NTA purely because your girlfriend sounds exhaustingly demanding for someone who isn't willing to help with the cooking, but I don't get what the initial problem with the amount of food is.", "NTA. The silent treatment is childish. Saying \"I'm upset and need space to calm down so I don't lash out\" (or communicating that intent) is not.  Sometimes I wonder if people get the silent treatment as much as they think they do or if people perceive folks avoiding a blow up by retreating to a neutral space as more than it is. \n\nEither way you're not an AH, but I wonder if your gf could work on communicating the why before the silence or if she already does. If she just stomps off and pouts/ignores you until you're forgiven (what I would truly consider silent treatment)  then you need to consider whether or not she's mature enough to actually be with.\n\nI think it's super sweet that you're cooking for her though.  The meals sound delicious and leftovers always get eaten around here so hopefully yall enjoy them too!", "Why would it matter if you didn\u2019t finish it? Are leftovers not an option?

I only make big meals when I can freeze it.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like it would be good to have a discussion about the amount of time and effort that goes into cooking. If I make chili, I'm having it by itself for one meal, then poured over hot dogs the next. Chicken sandwiches and homemade french fries are dinner today, then leftovers tomorrow. Homemade ice cream is a treat I'm making on a day I have simple pasta for dinner. Every so often I'll go all out and do a nice dinner and fancy dessert, but it's only when I really feel like it and have a passion for a given thing. I put on a nice dinner party once every couple weeks and spend 1-2 days before it prepping. Being asked to make that much food all in one day is pretty intrusive, regardless of how much is left over. It's wild to me that she got to adulthood without understanding that, but if you can't get through to her about it, it's time to reconsider the relationship.", "NTA what you said was the opposite of calling her fat! She needs to work on her insecurities.", "NTA. This feels like weaponized incompetence. There are a million books, classes, YouTube videos, and other resources that can teach you how to cook, so there is no reason that she can't do it. Does she at least do other chores so that your workload at home is even? \n\nYou could make her start helping you meal prep so she'll learn. Then you could freeze some meals so they don't go bad, then you'll have a variety to choose from in your freezer so you don't have to cook so often or waste food. Also, you can make chili in an instant pot, so it's a lot quicker and less work.", "OP, I\u2019m really concerned you don\u2019t understand how problematic your gf\u2019s behavior is. You clearly were displeased with people calling her a brat or a toddler or entitled, but honestly this is really demanding behavior. \n\nJust because you *can* cook all those things doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s fair to ask it of you. Cooking two involved meals, one with a side, and a homemade dessert, is too much to ask of a partner. The fact that she doesn\u2019t care that she\u2019s creating a bunch of unnecessary work for you is a red flag at best. It is bratty, it is greedy, it is entitled, and it is the behavior of a toddler. \n\nAnd the fact that you say she *sometimes* does the dishes is appalling. She should be doing the dishes every time you cook, the exception being like a birthday or something. \n\nI don\u2019t think based on your comments you\u2019re ready to hear it, but I think someday you\u2019re going to look back at this relationship and realize your gf was an entitled AH and there are a lotttt of people out there that wouldn\u2019t treat you like that. \n\nNTA except maybe to yourself by staying with someone like that.", "NTA, and frankly I wouldn't suggest dating anyone that doesn't know how to cook at least a few different meals.

Is your girlfriend almost getting her period? I get crazy hungry when I'm pms'ing and like you mentioned, never able to finish all of it. Lol.", "YTA. Learn how to keep your mouth shut.

Immaturity, selfishness, and entitlement, for starters. And it is absolutely a manipulative move to make bad faith accusations with zero provocation OR give you the \"silent treatment\" both for a perceived insult that *she made up herself* and the \"crime\" of not blindly following her orders. I don't know OP or their gf from squat, but that *is* manipulative and unhealthy behavior. \n\nIt would literally never occur to me to just walk up to someone I lived with and be like, \"Okay, so you are going to make lunch and dinner for us tomorrow, and you are going to make three separate meals plus sides and a large dessert. I am not going to help at all and when you voice reasonable reservations about me demanding that you make so much food for me, I will accuse you of trying to control me and calling me fat and will punish you by refusing to speak to you.\" \n\nA normal, healthy, mature person doesn't do any of those things. I don't like cooking and am not an especially impressive cook, but when my roommate (who is a very passionate and very good cook, and also my close friend) cooks for me, I try to always find ways to help. I'll go do the grocery shopping with her, I'll offer to help with minor tasks like stirring sauce or cutting vegetables, I'll do the dishes when she's done, etc. It's the same way when I am the one making us both food, or when she occasionally asks me to cook a specific dish for her. Sometimes she will refuse my help or tell me she doesn't need any aid, because she is a very capable cook, but she always thanks me for offering anyway. \n\nThis is because a normal, healthy, mature person who genuinely cares about the one cooking for them generally isn't comfortable just sitting idly around while the cook spends hours on end slaving away in the kitchen. Especially not when the cooking arrangement tends to be more one-sided, with one person preparing and making the majority of all homemade food.", "I am an adult who kinda knows how to cook but it always stresses me out. Everything goes wrong, I hate the mess it does, and the smell of cooking meat makes me sick. My husband knows how to cook, but he is not a fan of cooking. So we made an agreement that most days, we are ordering takeout. Sometimes I ask him to make something (ask, not demand!), like once every two months or so. This way, less food goes to waste, none of us have to suffer in the kitchen, and we can play some games with that spare time. \n\nI could never imagine giving him cold shoulder treatment  because he said no to my request.

Personally I'd find it easier to cook a steak than make chili on its own - less chopping, quicker, fewer ingredients to remember and locate, let alone dicking about with an extra pan and stuff for hot dogs and a bunch of extra toppings. It doesn't need to be haute cuisine to take time and effort or be a pain in the arse.\n\nIt'd make more sense for me to suggest something like chili dogs as a means of using up leftover chili which already existed. Not making chili with the sole purpose of topping hot dogs.\n\nThen there are plenty of options which don't require preparing food from scratch at all. Especially the home cut fries, like why?! Why not get takeout or just eat frozen chips like most people do?", "Just communicate with your gf.
