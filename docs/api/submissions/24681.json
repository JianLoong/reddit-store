Ollie has a son, Will (7) that he shares with his ex, while Lisa has a daughter, Nia (8) from her previous relationship. I have a daughter, Sienna (6). \n\nOver the past few weeks, I\u2019ve taken the kids out numerous places. The way it has always worked when I\u2019ve babysat Will is I take the kids out and then when I bring Will back I give Ollie or his ex an approximate cost for anything I bought while out and they pay me back. Obviously this is not a hard and fast rule, sometimes I will tell them not to worry about it if I\u2019ve bought lunch or small souvenirs but if Will comes back with something big, normally Ollie is insistent on paying me back for it. This works the same the other way round.\n\nI thought this would work the same with Lisa, but so far it hasn\u2019t. Since this holiday, and actually over the two years I\u2019ve known her, it either takes her a long time and several nagging reminders from my brother for her to pay me back, or she just doesn\u2019t. She will try to negotiate paying only a fraction of what is owed, saying she doesn\u2019t have the money and trying to make the costs my fault ie. Saying I should have taken the kids to fast food place instead of a restaurant. This has begun to get very irritating and I have found myself offering to take the kids out less because navigating the money with Lisa has become so awkward.\n\nMy husband and I are meant to take the kids out tomorrow, so last night I took Lisa aside and said to avoid any awkwardness, she should give me or Nia the amount of money she is happy to spend on the day upfront. That way, I know in advance what a comfortable budget is for her, and she doesn\u2019t have to worry about paying me back afterwards. Lisa got very offended and accused me of favouring the bio kids and singling out Nia. I said this had nothing to do with Nia, just Lisa herself, and that I was not happy to subsidise everything that Lisa doesn\u2019t feel like paying for after the fact. Lisa said this won\u2019t be fair because Nia won\u2019t be able to afford the souvenirs the other kids are getting and I said \u201cLisa you can\u2019t afford them now either, *I\u2019m* the one paying for everything\u201d. Lisa got very upset and said she would just pull Nia from the day out. \n\nMy husband says I did the right thing, my brother says I should have just been a bit stricter with Lisa about having to cough up and not asked her for the money upfront. I feel bad because now Nia is going to miss out on the outing and Ollie and Lisa don\u2019t get to spend the day alone but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to have to ask Lisa 7 times for money I spent on her kid. AITA?\n\nEdit: Ollie and Lisa keep their finances entirely separate, and they don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids. I was trying to be respectful of that by going to Lisa directly, because while Ollie does nudge Lisa to pay me back, I didn\u2019t think it was prudent to be asking him to pay me for Nia\u2019s expenses, knowing that that is not how they choose to do things.", "created_utc": 1692093372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ro7t0/aita_for_asking_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9_for_money/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did you discuss the activities ahead of time with the parents, or do you go do what you want then expect them to pay whatever the cost is?  Do they take your kid places and pay? Or is it always one sided? When we invite a friend along with our kid, we pay for the friend, and the other parents do the same when our kid goes with them. These are for small activities that cost less than $40-$50. Something bigger like a giant amusement park then parents would send along money. You aren\u2019t the AH, but they aren\u2019t either.

You are not obliged to spend money on your siblings, and Lisa has shown herself to be greedy and unreliable in paying bills afterward.\n\nNow she has to pay before.  Period.", "NTA. You can feel sorry for the kid, but this is entirely her mother's fault - so don't let anyone guilt-trip you into believing otherwise. Your approach was very reasonable.", "Info: Why not just ask your brother to pony up for both kids?", "NTA. Does she have money issues such as she is on a lower wage or struggles with bill payments?", "NTA. She's getting free babysitting and expecting you to pay for everything as well.

Isn't he the one then favouring his bio kids?", "Yeah but if this situation happened more than once and she wasn't happy with being expected to pay whatever OP spent, the correct response is not to be passive aggressively difficult about paying her back and bleat about favoritism, it's to say at literally any point before they got to this situation that \"I can afford and will give you X amount of money, if you want to spend any extra that's on you\"", "Because it\u2019s their child? I love Will, obviously, but if we\u2019re at a shopping centre and he wants a \u20ac350 Lego set, I do kind of expect Ollie would want to pay me back for that? I buy Will gifts often and sometimes the kids do get stuff while we\u2019re out and I tell Ollie not to worry about it, tbh the gesture of him offering to pay me back speaks more than the actual money.", "He has told her, and when she doesn\u2019t pay he\u2019s the one who reminds her, but it just feels so messy.", "If I have a distinct plan like going to an amusement park, then yes I tell everyone what I\u2019m doing.

Same with my kid. Ollie\u2019s ex takes Sienna shopping with her sometimes and Sienna will come back with a bunch of new stuff, I expect to pay it back. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going through receipts with fine tooth comb but there\u2019s a mutual trust there that things are kept somewhat fair.", "I know they keep separate finances so I thought talking to her about it directly was a bit more respectful than going to Ollie. But normally it\u2019s him nudging her to pay me back.", "He and Lisa keep their finances totally separate, so I am not expecting him to pay me back for Nia\u2019s stuff. He is the one always nudging Lisa to pay me back but obviously he feels I could be a bit sterner about her paying the whole amount etc", "Ollie and Lisa keep separate finances and don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids\u2019 things.", "I totally agree with you! The only thing I want to add is that OP should have done this from the start, or had a conversation with Lisa (Lisa was the SIL, right?) about it instead of just buying stuff and expecting the money back, cause that puts Lisa in a very awkward position if she doesn't have the funds. And it's not like she can say no don't buy my kid anything, and leave her kid out.\n\nBut Lisa could also have been a grown up and explained if she couldn't afford it the first couple of times it happened. \n\nI wanna say ESH really", "I would be so embarrassed if my family had to chase down my partner for money \u2014 especially for a favor as big as childcare.", "That\u2019s why I said Nta. But I can\u2019t imagine spending hundreds on a Lego set without asking the parents if they\u2019re ok with that kind of expense.", "Or you could just say no? \u20ac350 is a lot when you aren\u2019t expecting the expense.", "Taking other kids shopping is new territory for me. I don\u2019t take other (non-relative) kids shopping because I don\u2019t know the money situation of the other parents, and I don\u2019t want to make them feel obligated to pay me back (legos are expensive!) I prefer taking them to experiences (which may still include the gift shop). We\u2019ve spent more on birthday/Christmas presents for nieces/nephews than they have on our kid, but that is because our money situation is different and we don\u2019t mind being nice. Maybe ask yourself why you are letting yourself be so bothered by it (not a judgy thing, I do the same thing when I find myself getting angry over things like this, I should be having fun with the kids instead of getting angry with an adult)? Is the money you are spending on them preventing you from buying a necessity for your own family? Is this just one more thing on a list of things you don\u2019t like about Lisa? If you are a lot better off financially, maybe just let it go and let the cousins play with each other more, but don\u2019t take them shopping, or maybe impose a $10 limit for everybody.", "I could, but we\u2019ve never done it that way. There\u2019s always been an agreement between Ollie, me, and the spouses that this is how we do it. Lisa has been well aware of that for two years, if she wanted things handled differently she only had to say that. And me asking her to set the budget upfront was trying to help her do that.", "I don\u2019t take non relative kids shopping either, but Will is my relative so I have on occasion, same with Will\u2019s mother and Sienna. \n\nThe money is not preventing me from doing anything, except the prospect of this awkward dance around the money is making me offer to take Nia out less. There are no list of reasons I don\u2019t like Lisa, it\u2019s literally just this. I think making people chase you for money and trying to haggle over the money you pay someone back after the fact is really rude. At the end of the day, why didn\u2019t Lisa just give me the money in advance? Then she can set the budget she\u2019s comfortable with and we never have to talk about it again?", "You asking for a budget up front is why I said Nta. Otherwise you\u2019re spending a lot and then just expecting everyone is fine with it.", "Could you have her set the budget up front, and then have that be the budget for each of the kids?  You are obviously in the right about not wanting to subsidize her.  But I can also understand if she is concerned about her daughter watching the other kids get expensive things and feeling less-than.  Maybe you could explicitly plan on a cheaper outing all around so it feels more equitable and is something she can afford.  It could also help prevent the other kids from getting spoiled (not that they necessarily are, but young kids don\u2019t need to get EVERYTHING they want all the time).", "At this point maybe ask yourself is it worth it to punish the kids, and take away cousin time, to prove a point to Lisa about being equal. I don\u2019t understand why you are so focused on everything having to be so equal (it\u2019s not just you, I\u2019ve seen it as a trend on here). You are spending all this time, including the time invested in this post, focusing on Lisa and letting your anger build. This is time that can be spent thinking about positive things and improving yourself. You don\u2019t know Lisa\u2019s financial situation, she may be struggling to pay bills. If she is struggling with money, then I\u2019m sure she is aware and feels bad about it, but also wants her kid to be able to bond with family. Remember, you are family (or soon to be family), and will be spending the rest of your lives around each other, and the kids will hopefully form lifelong bonds from this time together  when they are young. Family is about love, not being equal. \nAlso, maybe buy your kid the expensive stuff when you are just with your immediate family. I just read in another post you spent a lot of money on a Lego set, that\u2019s on you! You can\u2019t spend that much then expect to be paid back.", "Why does everything have to be (vaguely) equal? Is that a serious question? Because you can\u2019t just expect everyone else to pay for you all the time?", "Sometimes people are nice to those less fortunate than them.", "And if they are at a shopping center and the kids wants an expensive Lego set or toy, you say NO! You don\u2019t say yes then expect the parents to pay after the fact.", "I would say that effectively, your brother and Lisa are going to be married.  Will and Nia are going to be THEIR kids.  \n\nSure, if Will's mom's family is rich and buys him a car when he turns 16, they don't have to make that fair, because Will's mom's family has no obligation to Nia.  However, your brother and Lisa DO have an obligation to be fair to Will and Nia.   YOU do not have to be financially responsible for Will OR Nia.\n\nTell your brother, that from now on, if you take Will and Nia on an outing, you will expect to be given a budget and be reimbursed for both of their costs by him.  You should not be wrangling money out of your soon to be sister in law..  It is for him to work out with Lisa and she can pay him back, and they should be making sure that Will and Nia are treated fairly when they are on a family outing, because they are (or will be legally, very soon) family.  \n\nYou are just treating your niblings equally like a good aunt.", "Idk how this has not been clear throughout my other responses. Both Ollie, me, and our spouses have an agreement that it\u2019s fine to buy the kids things that they want, and we sort out the money later. We have done this since they were babies. \n\nIt is up to Lisa (because she KNOWS we do this) to tell me if Nia is not allowed to buy anything while out. She has never said a word about this. It\u2019s not like she sees Nia come back with something and says no sorry I can\u2019t pay for that you need to return it, or tells me in advance. No, she wants Nia to do exactly what the other two do, she just doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for the cost.", "Ollie and Lisa keep their finances separate, they don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids\u2019 stuff.\n\nETA : yes I could have said Ollie has to pay and he can get the money from Lisa but that felt disrespectful to her for me to go around her like that,especially knowing that they keep things separate. I was trying to be sensitive to that dynamic.", "Personally, I think they should re-evaluate this if they don't want resentment from both of the kids.  It is going to cause problems in their marriage. \n\nSure, maybe they aren't responsible for buying clothes and shoes and toys (outside of holiday/birthday) for each other's kids.  That's fine.  But for a family outing, they should be covering the costs as a family, divided however is appropriate based on income. \n\nEither Nia is going to resent Will and your brother for getting to do things Lisa can't afford, or Will is going to resent Nia and Lisa for always forcing outings to be scaled down to match Lisa's level of willingness to financially contribute.  \n\nHousehold expenses not being shared AT ALL is just going to be a nightmare to manage.  So are there going to be \"snacks for Nia\" and \"snacks for Will\" where they can't have each other's and they are going to get yelled at if they grab a granola bar from the wrong box?  When they make dinner do they make separate meals so they don't use \"each other's\" ingredients?  That just doesn't make any sense.  \n\nMost people I know who keep separate finances still have some amount of shared responsibility.  An engaged or married couple having to venmo each other constantly sounds exhausting.  A shared account for household expenses, groceries and family outings that they each contribute an agreed on amount to each month seems like a way less contentious arrangement.  I can't imagine having to nickel and dime my husband every day.  I would want to divorce just so I didn't have to do all of that accounting.  What a pain in the ass."]}
