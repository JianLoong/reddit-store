I have a daughter, Sienna (6). \n\nOver the past few weeks, I\u2019ve taken the kids out numerous places. The way it has always worked when I\u2019ve babysat Will is I take the kids out and then when I bring Will back I give Ollie or his ex an approximate cost for anything I bought while out and they pay me back. Obviously this is not a hard and fast rule, sometimes I will tell them not to worry about it if I\u2019ve bought lunch or small souvenirs but if Will comes back with something big, normally Ollie is insistent on paying me back for it. This works the same the other way round.\n\nI thought this would work the same with Lisa, but so far it hasn\u2019t. Since this holiday, and actually over the two years I\u2019ve known her, it either takes her a long time and several nagging reminders from my brother for her to pay me back, or she just doesn\u2019t. She will try to negotiate paying only a fraction of what is owed, saying she doesn\u2019t have the money and trying to make the costs my fault ie. Saying I should have taken the kids to fast food place instead of a restaurant. This has begun to get very irritating and I have found myself offering to take the kids out less because navigating the money with Lisa has become so awkward.\n\nMy husband and I are meant to take the kids out tomorrow, so last night I took Lisa aside and said to avoid any awkwardness, she should give me or Nia the amount of money she is happy to spend on the day upfront. That way, I know in advance what a comfortable budget is for her, and she doesn\u2019t have to worry about paying me back afterwards. Lisa got very offended and accused me of favouring the bio kids and singling out Nia. I said this had nothing to do with Nia, just Lisa herself, and that I was not happy to subsidise everything that Lisa doesn\u2019t feel like paying for after the fact. Lisa said this won\u2019t be fair because Nia won\u2019t be able to afford the souvenirs the other kids are getting and I said \u201cLisa you can\u2019t afford them now either, *I\u2019m* the one paying for everything\u201d.

Asking for the money upfront *is* being strict. And your brother should not be leaving this up to you.\n\nAnd yes, Lisa has been taking advantage of your generosity of time and money. She knows you\u2019re a good parent and aunt and hopes you\u2019ll be guilted into continuing to pay. It is horrible to have to repeatedly ask someone for money when they ought to automatically hand it over. \n\n As is so often the case, no good deed goes unpunished. NTA.", "NTA: her kid, her responsibility, not yours", "NTA. Lisa caused this by trying to get out of paying completely. Had she just been upfront and said.. only spend x amount there wouldn't have been any problems. She flat out admitted she wanted her daughter to have the same money to spend on souvenirs knowing she didn't have the money herself.", "NTA. Those who are shitty at being fair get offended when called out about their shitty behaviour.     \nEasily avoided if she was just fair, and wanted peace.", "NTA, but talk to your brother as well. He may be willing to cover Nia's costs and /or speak to Lisa directly.\n\nETA - just saw he is suggesting you should be 'stricter' - no, you shouldn't have to chase Lisa up, you've been doing her a favour and the least she can do is pay up the first time she is asked. IF he isn't comfortable with you asking for money up front he's free to cover his partner's expense and then he can be 'strict' with her about getting  refunded. I'd actually propose that to him, so he can take the responsibility for getting money out of his partner.", "NTA. Your brother needs to tell her to cough up, not put it on you", "She is angry because she can't use you when you ask for the money beforehand simple as that", "NTA.\n\nYou're already doing Lisa a huge favour by bringing Nia out on fun excursions and providing free childcare, essentially. It's not on you to bear the cost of every outing (obviously small gifts now and then are nice, but NOT EVERY MEAL).", "NTA\n\n Then she can keep her kid with her, problem solved.", "NTA.", "NTA. I think you handled it well and tried to be communicative and mature about it.", "If you repeatedly spent more money on her child than she would have without checking with her, then I would've understood her reluctance to pay up. It's uncomfortable having to admit you have less disposable income. But you offered up an alternative compromise which any rational parent would have been really relieved by! So NTA. I feel bad for the kid, hopefully she'll come round to the (very workable) solution of paying up front.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
