Ollie has a son, Will (7) that he shares with his ex, while Lisa has a daughter, Nia (8) from her previous relationship. I have a daughter, Sienna (6). \n\nOver the past few weeks, I\u2019ve taken the kids out numerous places. The way it has always worked when I\u2019ve babysat Will is I take the kids out and then when I bring Will back I give Ollie or his ex an approximate cost for anything I bought while out and they pay me back. Obviously this is not a hard and fast rule, sometimes I will tell them not to worry about it if I\u2019ve bought lunch or small souvenirs but if Will comes back with something big, normally Ollie is insistent on paying me back for it. This works the same the other way round.\n\nI thought this would work the same with Lisa, but so far it hasn\u2019t. Since this holiday, and actually over the two years I\u2019ve known her, it either takes her a long time and several nagging reminders from my brother for her to pay me back, or she just doesn\u2019t. She will try to negotiate paying only a fraction of what is owed, saying she doesn\u2019t have the money and trying to make the costs my fault ie. Saying I should have taken the kids to fast food place instead of a restaurant. This has begun to get very irritating and I have found myself offering to take the kids out less because navigating the money with Lisa has become so awkward.\n\nMy husband and I are meant to take the kids out tomorrow, so last night I took Lisa aside and said to avoid any awkwardness, she should give me or Nia the amount of money she is happy to spend on the day upfront. That way, I know in advance what a comfortable budget is for her, and she doesn\u2019t have to worry about paying me back afterwards. Lisa got very offended and accused me of favouring the bio kids and singling out Nia. I said this had nothing to do with Nia, just Lisa herself, and that I was not happy to subsidise everything that Lisa doesn\u2019t feel like paying for after the fact. Lisa said this won\u2019t be fair because Nia won\u2019t be able to afford the souvenirs the other kids are getting and I said \u201cLisa you can\u2019t afford them now either, *I\u2019m* the one paying for everything\u201d. Lisa got very upset and said she would just pull Nia from the day out. \n\nMy husband says I did the right thing, my brother says I should have just been a bit stricter with Lisa about having to cough up and not asked her for the money upfront. I feel bad because now Nia is going to miss out on the outing and Ollie and Lisa don\u2019t get to spend the day alone but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to have to ask Lisa 7 times for money I spent on her kid. AITA?\n\nEdit: Ollie and Lisa keep their finances entirely separate, and they don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids. I was trying to be respectful of that by going to Lisa directly, because while Ollie does nudge Lisa to pay me back, I didn\u2019t think it was prudent to be asking him to pay me for Nia\u2019s expenses, knowing that that is not how they choose to do things.", "created_utc": 1692093372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ro7t0/aita_for_asking_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9_for_money/", "score": 792, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother should be paying you and then getting the money from Lisa.  Its his fiance, his future step kid and you are allowing them free time to be child free.\n\nAbsolutely do not take Lisa's kid out without money in advance or confirmation that your brother will pay up immediately like he does with his son.", "Are you officially babysitting them, or are you taking the initiative and asking them to go places with you and your kid because you are a nice aunt and you want your kid to hang with their cousins? Did you discuss the activities ahead of time with the parents, or do you go do what you want then expect them to pay whatever the cost is?  Do they take your kid places and pay? Or is it always one sided? When we invite a friend along with our kid, we pay for the friend, and the other parents do the same when our kid goes with them. These are for small activities that cost less than $40-$50. Something bigger like a giant amusement park then parents would send along money. You aren\u2019t the AH, but they aren\u2019t either. Don\u2019t invite other kids along if you don\u2019t expect to pay for them. I\u2019ve never asked another parent or relative to pay me back when I took their kid to dinner.\n\nEdit: in your original post you say Lisa said she didn\u2019t have the money. You can\u2019t be mad at somebody who has less than you and can\u2019t keep up with your lifestyle. You should be mad at your brother for treating his fianc\u00e9 as a second class citizen instead of an equal partner.

Lisa is the one responsible for this, not you.", "NTA, Lisa is and to some extend your brother is too. He is going to marry this woman and yet he wouldn't even pay for some souvenirs for his future stepdaughter that her mum can't afford? Asking a sister to be stricter with his future wife?

You can feel sorry for the kid, but this is entirely her mother's fault - so don't let anyone guilt-trip you into believing otherwise. Your approach was very reasonable.", "Info: Why not just ask your brother to pony up for both kids?", "NTA. Does she have money issues such as she is on a lower wage or struggles with bill payments?", "NTA. She's getting free babysitting and expecting you to pay for everything as well.

Brother knows LISA WOULDN\u2019T PAY BACK!", "Agreed! Why is it OPs responsibility to chase for reimbursement from her brothers soon to be wife and soon to be step daughter? Why doesn't he pay?  Isn't he the one then favouring his bio kids?", "Yeah but if this situation happened more than once and she wasn't happy with being expected to pay whatever OP spent, the correct response is not to be passive aggressively difficult about paying her back and bleat about favoritism, it's to say at literally any point before they got to this situation that \"I can afford and will give you X amount of money, if you want to spend any extra that's on you\"", "Because it\u2019s their child? I love Will, obviously, but if we\u2019re at a shopping centre and he wants a \u20ac350 Lego set, I do kind of expect Ollie would want to pay me back for that? I buy Will gifts often and sometimes the kids do get stuff while we\u2019re out and I tell Ollie not to worry about it, tbh the gesture of him offering to pay me back speaks more than the actual money.", "He has told her, and when she doesn\u2019t pay he\u2019s the one who reminds her, but it just feels so messy.", "If I have a distinct plan like going to an amusement park, then yes I tell everyone what I\u2019m doing. If it\u2019s just a \u201chey let me take the kids for the day so you can have some time off\u201d and I don\u2019t have a concrete plan, then no. \n\nWhenever Ollie takes Sienna anywhere he pays, and like I said most of the time we don\u2019t bother asking for the money but for example if I take the kids out and we go to a shopping centre and Will wants something for the Lego store, I buy him the Lego and Ollie or his ex will see him with the Lego and be like \u201chey let me pay you back for that\u201d. Same with my kid. Ollie\u2019s ex takes Sienna shopping with her sometimes and Sienna will come back with a bunch of new stuff, I expect to pay it back. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going through receipts with fine tooth comb but there\u2019s a mutual trust there that things are kept somewhat fair.", "I know they keep separate finances so I thought talking to her about it directly was a bit more respectful than going to Ollie. But normally it\u2019s him nudging her to pay me back.", "He and Lisa keep their finances totally separate, so I am not expecting him to pay me back for Nia\u2019s stuff. He is the one always nudging Lisa to pay me back but obviously he feels I could be a bit sterner about her paying the whole amount etc", "Ollie and Lisa keep separate finances and don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids\u2019 things.", "I totally agree with you! The only thing I want to add is that OP should have done this from the start, or had a conversation with Lisa (Lisa was the SIL, right?) about it instead of just buying stuff and expecting the money back, cause that puts Lisa in a very awkward position if she doesn't have the funds. And it's not like she can say no don't buy my kid anything, and leave her kid out.\n\nBut Lisa could also have been a grown up and explained if she couldn't afford it the first couple of times it happened. \n\nI wanna say ESH really", "I would be so embarrassed if my family had to chase down my partner for money \u2014 especially for a favor as big as childcare.", "That\u2019s why I said Nta. But I can\u2019t imagine spending hundreds on a Lego set without asking the parents if they\u2019re ok with that kind of expense.", "Or you could just say no? \u20ac350 is a lot when you aren\u2019t expecting the expense.", "Taking other kids shopping is new territory for me. I don\u2019t take other (non-relative) kids shopping because I don\u2019t know the money situation of the other parents, and I don\u2019t want to make them feel obligated to pay me back (legos are expensive!) I prefer taking them to experiences (which may still include the gift shop). We\u2019ve spent more on birthday/Christmas presents for nieces/nephews than they have on our kid, but that is because our money situation is different and we don\u2019t mind being nice. Maybe ask yourself why you are letting yourself be so bothered by it (not a judgy thing, I do the same thing when I find myself getting angry over things like this, I should be having fun with the kids instead of getting angry with an adult)? Is the money you are spending on them preventing you from buying a necessity for your own family? Is this just one more thing on a list of things you don\u2019t like about Lisa? If you are a lot better off financially, maybe just let it go and let the cousins play with each other more, but don\u2019t take them shopping, or maybe impose a $10 limit for everybody.", "I could, but we\u2019ve never done it that way. There\u2019s always been an agreement between Ollie, me, and the spouses that this is how we do it. Lisa has been well aware of that for two years, if she wanted things handled differently she only had to say that. And me asking her to set the budget upfront was trying to help her do that.", "I don\u2019t take non relative kids shopping either, but Will is my relative so I have on occasion, same with Will\u2019s mother and Sienna. \n\nThe money is not preventing me from doing anything, except the prospect of this awkward dance around the money is making me offer to take Nia out less. There are no list of reasons I don\u2019t like Lisa, it\u2019s literally just this. I think making people chase you for money and trying to haggle over the money you pay someone back after the fact is really rude. At the end of the day, why didn\u2019t Lisa just give me the money in advance? Then she can set the budget she\u2019s comfortable with and we never have to talk about it again?", "You asking for a budget up front is why I said Nta. Otherwise you\u2019re spending a lot and then just expecting everyone is fine with it.", "Could you have her set the budget up front, and then have that be the budget for each of the kids?  You are obviously in the right about not wanting to subsidize her.  But I can also understand if she is concerned about her daughter watching the other kids get expensive things and feeling less-than.  Maybe you could explicitly plan on a cheaper outing all around so it feels more equitable and is something she can afford.  It could also help prevent the other kids from getting spoiled (not that they necessarily are, but young kids don\u2019t need to get EVERYTHING they want all the time).", "At this point maybe ask yourself is it worth it to punish the kids, and take away cousin time, to prove a point to Lisa about being equal. I don\u2019t understand why you are so focused on everything having to be so equal (it\u2019s not just you, I\u2019ve seen it as a trend on here). You are spending all this time, including the time invested in this post, focusing on Lisa and letting your anger build. This is time that can be spent thinking about positive things and improving yourself. You don\u2019t know Lisa\u2019s financial situation, she may be struggling to pay bills. If she is struggling with money, then I\u2019m sure she is aware and feels bad about it, but also wants her kid to be able to bond with family. Remember, you are family (or soon to be family), and will be spending the rest of your lives around each other, and the kids will hopefully form lifelong bonds from this time together  when they are young. Family is about love, not being equal. \nAlso, maybe buy your kid the expensive stuff when you are just with your immediate family. I just read in another post you spent a lot of money on a Lego set, that\u2019s on you! You can\u2019t spend that much then expect to be paid back.", "Why does everything have to be (vaguely) equal? Is that a serious question? Because you can\u2019t just expect everyone else to pay for you all the time?", "Sometimes people are nice to those less fortunate than them.", "And if they are at a shopping center and the kids wants an expensive Lego set or toy, you say NO! You don\u2019t say yes then expect the parents to pay after the fact.", "I would say that effectively, your brother and Lisa are going to be married.  Will and Nia are going to be THEIR kids.  \n\nSure, if Will's mom's family is rich and buys him a car when he turns 16, they don't have to make that fair, because Will's mom's family has no obligation to Nia.  However, your brother and Lisa DO have an obligation to be fair to Will and Nia.   YOU do not have to be financially responsible for Will OR Nia.\n\nTell your brother, that from now on, if you take Will and Nia on an outing, you will expect to be given a budget and be reimbursed for both of their costs by him.  You should not be wrangling money out of your soon to be sister in law..  It is for him to work out with Lisa and she can pay him back, and they should be making sure that Will and Nia are treated fairly when they are on a family outing, because they are (or will be legally, very soon) family.  \n\nYou are just treating your niblings equally like a good aunt.", "Idk how this has not been clear throughout my other responses. Both Ollie, me, and our spouses have an agreement that it\u2019s fine to buy the kids things that they want, and we sort out the money later. We have done this since they were babies. \n\nIt is up to Lisa (because she KNOWS we do this) to tell me if Nia is not allowed to buy anything while out. She has never said a word about this. It\u2019s not like she sees Nia come back with something and says no sorry I can\u2019t pay for that you need to return it, or tells me in advance. No, she wants Nia to do exactly what the other two do, she just doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for the cost.", "Ollie and Lisa keep their finances separate, they don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids\u2019 stuff.\n\nETA : yes I could have said Ollie has to pay and he can get the money from Lisa but that felt disrespectful to her for me to go around her like that,especially knowing that they keep things separate. I was trying to be sensitive to that dynamic.", "Personally, I think they should re-evaluate this if they don't want resentment from both of the kids.  It is going to cause problems in their marriage. \n\nSure, maybe they aren't responsible for buying clothes and shoes and toys (outside of holiday/birthday) for each other's kids.  That's fine.  But for a family outing, they should be covering the costs as a family, divided however is appropriate based on income. \n\nEither Nia is going to resent Will and your brother for getting to do things Lisa can't afford, or Will is going to resent Nia and Lisa for always forcing outings to be scaled down to match Lisa's level of willingness to financially contribute.  \n\nHousehold expenses not being shared AT ALL is just going to be a nightmare to manage.  So are there going to be \"snacks for Nia\" and \"snacks for Will\" where they can't have each other's and they are going to get yelled at if they grab a granola bar from the wrong box?  When they make dinner do they make separate meals so they don't use \"each other's\" ingredients?  That just doesn't make any sense.  \n\nMost people I know who keep separate finances still have some amount of shared responsibility.  An engaged or married couple having to venmo each other constantly sounds exhausting.  A shared account for household expenses, groceries and family outings that they each contribute an agreed on amount to each month seems like a way less contentious arrangement.  I can't imagine having to nickel and dime my husband every day.  I would want to divorce just so I didn't have to do all of that accounting.  What a pain in the ass.", "You did say yourself that Lisa can\u2019t afford these outings. Maybe when you take the kids out all together, you take them to low or no cost places a little more often to balance it out? How often do you go to places with souvenirs??", "NAH, for now\n\nSeems to me there's a big social and/or cultural miscommunication here that I think will be hard to find compromise. \n\nLisa is of the mind that relatives who offer to spend time with her kid pay for all expenses while you feel that all expenses should be reimbursed by the parent. It's hard to find a medium ground because each side sees this situation very differently. \n\nUnfortunately, I think from now on you have to be very clear and set a new standard that if Lisa would like you to invite her kiddo then Lisa needs to give you the monetary budget before you leave with her kid OR if brother doesn't want to deal with the problems that might create, brother reimburses you for both kids. As awkward and crappy as that seems, you two are coming from very different points and compromise is the only way this can move forward if Lisa's daughter will also come along.", "NTA. What I am a little concerned about is that she has little money left over to pay for activities for her daughter when they share household expenses. Are those expenses split 50/50, and do they have comparable incomes? I am sure your brother would feel differently if their shared child and her child were the ones that could have activities, and he his other child excluded because he didn't have the funds. Blended families are difficult, and a marriage won't work if one of the children is excluded due to funds.", "NTA. Although it\u2019s a little ESH-ish, since this has happened more than once she\u2019s more to blame for not being proactive about this conversation.\n\nOn your end: IMO it\u2019s not appropriate to create a (variable, uncapped, non-emergency) debt for someone without their permission, and get upset when they don\u2019t pay it back according to your timeline. You and Ollie have created a blank check financial arrangement (that he initiated), where he pays you back for the (non-essential, non-emergency) things you choose to pay for for his kid, and that arrangement works for his financial situation. Maybe he has more money and so this type of open tab makes sense. You *assumed* that arrangement also would work for Lisa, but you didn\u2019t confirm that with her before you started racking up a tab for her, and then you get upset at her after the fact. That\u2019s not fair. She may in fact be in a more limited financial situation and not be able to afford what you\u2019re asking her to pay, and you didn\u2019t check with her before you decided to spend. Generally speaking: If I voluntarily choose to spend on someone without an advance agreement on the amount and an agreement to pay me back, I view it as a gift and do not feel entitled to be paid back. \n\nHowever: bc this was more than a one time occurrence, she also should have taken initiative to be clear about her financial boundaries instead of being passive and having you repeatedly asking her for money back. Fundamentally you\u2019re trying to do a nice thing by creating fun, inclusive social bonding opportunities for her kid, and the way she\u2019s handling this doesn\u2019t recognize that. It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s reciprocating with her own trips/outings either. That behavior is definitely entitled.\n\nShe does makes a valid point though, that the way you\u2019re suggesting to plan trips seems to be singling Nia out unnecessarily. If you are paying for things for the other two kids, but expecting Nia to carry money and pay for herself, IMO that\u2019s a very bizarre way to treat children. It would make much more sense for 1) every child to carry their own money (create a uniform policy), or imo even better 2) for you to ask Lisa for what budget is reasonable for her in advance and then plan trips within that budget for everyone. It would be totally fine to ask for payment in advance \u2014 would just be like any field trip.", "ESH\n\nHonestly this is such a weird situation to me. I can't imagine taking my nieces and nephews on a day out and asking my brother/sister to reimburse me. They're my family! If I wasn't willing to buy them lunch then I just wouldn't take them out. And if we're talking a much bigger purchase than lunch then why the hell would you allow a 7/8 year old to make such a big purchase, without consulting their parent first (whom you expect to pay for it)?!\n\nAnd now, rather than cancelling the trip you're going to let one kid miss out and make it clear to them that they're not a real part of the family. What did Nia do to deserve this?\n\nYour brother and his fiance have weird systems. I get that it's whatever works for them but now it's involving you which is not ok. He should pay for both of the kids and claim the money from Lisa if he cares. The burden shouldn't be on you.\n\nLisa shouldn't go into a system like this and then try and manipulate her way into not paying. If she's not willing or not able to pay then she should have discussed that with you not just try and get out of it.\n\nInfo: if Lisa had given you a small amount of money for Nia but the activities you'd planned cost more than that, what would you have done?

So I'm covering tickets, gas and meals but I'm not buying video games and toy sets.", "I think the way I wrote it made it sound like I want every penny back, and that\u2019s simply not the case. Most of the time I do just swallow the cost, but mind you that\u2019s because Ollie/his ex do as well. And yes, we have an agreement to buy the kids what they want when we\u2019re out with each other\u2019s because in our minds, we\u2019re being saved a trip to the toy store. I don\u2019t mind if Sienna comes back with dolls after a day out, it\u2019s not like I wouldn\u2019t have bought them at some point anyway. I get that this might not work for everyone, but for us it\u2019s normal and simpler. \n\nMy thing is, Lisa has known this for two years. For two years, she\u2019s seen Ollie take my daughter out and buy her things and me pay him back and vice versa. She never came to me and said \u201cplease don\u2019t let Nia buy anything while you\u2019re at the shopping centre\u201d, nor did she say \u201cthis thing that Nia has come home with is out of my budget, could you please return it\u201d. She takes things, pretends she\u2019s fine with paying them, and then a few days later when I remind her, she starts saying she can\u2019t afford it. That for me is crossing a line. Or, she could tell Nia not to ask for things while out. I\u2019ve said that to my daughter, \u201cwhen you\u2019re out with (friend), I know you might want a toy or xyz but mummy\u2019s not there to pay for it, and friend\u2019s mummy isn\u2019t going to buy it for you, so just remember what it is and we can get it when it\u2019s just you and me\u201d. She has had these options for two years, and she had the option to just try and work with me when I spoke to her, but she has taken none of them. That leads me to believe that because everything is suiting her - not having to pay, or at worst only partially, that she\u2019s fine with that. \n\nIf Lisa said \u201cthis is my budget for the day\u201d, I would try to work around that where possible. That said, if I knew that budget wouldn\u2019t work ie. Wouldn\u2019t cover tickets for an amusement park etc then I would expect her to factor that in.

Ask her if the agreement with your brother works for her as well?\n\nYou said she's had 2 years to bring it up, but so have you.\n\nIf the issue is with big toy purchases and not with daily outing costs, rather than leaving Nia at home and taking the other two why don't you just do something less expensive or skip the shops?", "Why the hell would you allow a 7 year old to spend so much money without consulting their parent? And from the sounds of it this seems to be a regular thing so you've potentially allowed a 7 year old to spend thousands of euros of their parents money, without consulting them!", "Then Ollie needs to not comment on how you get reimbursed. It seems he understands very well who he is marrying.", "Yeah, I agree.  When OP takes their kids out, spends as she chooses, and then expects reimbursement after the fact, she's basically spending *their* money--and apparently spending more than Lisa wants to.

In hindsight perhaps it only continued to work because when Ollie and Lisa take the kids, Ollie is the one paying for Sienna\u2019s stuff, not Lisa. But I still think if you are the new person entering a dynamic it\u2019s up to you to say if it doesn\u2019t work for you. In all the times I\u2019ve taken Nia out she never once thought to pull me aside and say \u201chey please don\u2019t let Nia buy any toys while you\u2019re out today\u201d, that\u2019s all it would have taken. \n\nI\u2019m happy to sometimes change plans, but I\u2019m also not willing to do that all the time.

At the end of the day, I am 100% willing to work with Lisa within reason, that\u2019s what I was trying to do by eliminating the awkwardness, and I feel like she made it clear she doesn\u2019t want to reach a compromise by walking off in a huff.", "Because my brother and his ex have said in advance that they don\u2019t mind. We have *always* all (brother, ex, me, and my husband) been fine with this.", "Lisa has known this for two years. If she was unhappy at any point, she could have said that to me?

It's not fair to exclude Nia and make her feel bad, she's done nothing wrong.", "I'd say NTA because you have a particular standing arrangement with your brother, but just for myself I have to point out that this is the whackiest arrangement I've ever heard of.  If someone offered to take my kid out for the day and they came back with a \u20ac350 gift \"from aunty\" that I was then expected to pay for - along with the expenses of the day out - without knowing about this in advance, I'd be resistant to paying too.  And you'd probably never see my kid again.", ">If she was unhappy at any point, she could have said that to me?\n\nIt sounds like she **has** been doing that.

Sister should not be involved in any of that mess.", "That was my initial thought - both brother and his fianc\u00e9 are the arses for their behavior.\n\nHow does the brother plan on handling expenses for his soon to be step child?  Will he spend more on his bio child? Not have the step child go places? \n\nAlso presumably brother's bio child has a bio mother who might be taking the bio child for experiences that the step child might not have.\n\nIn my opinion, it is a very sneaky passive aggressive way for the brother to get OP to cover costs that BROTHER should be paying for if Lisa can't afford to cover them.", "I agree abt lisa. But i think the brother caused this by putting his sister in an awkward situ.", "I agree NTA. Maybe ask as a group what the spending limit could be for each so no one gets too much more than the others.\n\nFully agree it is not OP problem to be stricter with Lisa. Lisa and the brother are both adults that should know how things work. Personally, as a brother I would cover the cost and figure out expenses that way it doesn't create issues with a significant other and family.", "You are right", "This this this this this", "The trips aren\u2019t weekly, it\u2019s maybe once a month. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t ever told me anything. She has - after the fact - berated me for my choice of activity, even if she has known about the plan beforehand. If she had said even once \u201cplease don\u2019t buy Nia anything while you\u2019re out\u201d or \u201chey Nia won\u2019t be going to amusement park, I just don\u2019t think the cost is worth it\u201d or something similar, we wouldn\u2019t be here. She\u2019s never even, upon seeing things Nia comes home with and knowing she doesn\u2019t want to pay for them, said \u201chey this is really not in my budget, can you return this\u201d. Nothing. \n\nRealistically, because of her bargaining and making it so hard to get the money from her, I have spent more money on Nia than Ollie has in the years I\u2019ve known her. That doesn\u2019t sit right with me. And the fact that the one time I bring it up with her she is defensive and not willing to work on a solution, tells me I\u2019m being taken for a ride.", "This is also why I dont bother holding expenses over anyones heads, it leads to nothing more than fights.\n\nMeeting a friend for lunch? Ill get the check you get the next one. Buying dinner for my kids and my nephews? Im not expecting my brother to pay me back. At the end of the day, its just money.", "Exactly! I can understand how it could be a problem early on if OP and their family have a precedent of this kind of spending and a general feel for how much they can reasonably spend on an outing that Lisa wasn't prepared for or couldn't match. But when OP tactfully asked for a budget ahead of time the argument was that \"Nia wouldn't be able to afford what the other kids are getting\" ... which indicates Lisa isn't viewing this as a budgeting issue but rather wanting her kid to get as much as the other kids but without having to pay for it.", "[removed]", " And you have no responsibility to be strict about it, if anything Ollie needs to talk with his fianc\u00e9 and teach her about common decency.", "Your brother should pay you. Then he can seek reimbursement from his own damn wife. He is being ridiculous and a bit of a coward.", "Yeah outside of the issues with OP, there are bigger problems between Lisa and Bro, in my opinion. I get keeping seperate finances, but when there is obviously a large enough wage discrepancy between partners that it affects the lifestyles of the different children living in the same house, that needs to be sorted out. Is teenage Nephew going to to have a brand new car paid for by Daddy, while Lisa's daughter will be riding the bus? \n\nThat's how you create a household full of resentment. I get that nephew seems to have both parents in his life to pay for things and maybe Lisa's baby daddy is useless, but they cant ignore the elephant in the room and expect things to run smoothly. Bro needs to step up as a step parent and either say \"let's cut back on the extravagance of these days out\" or help subsidize the \"fun stuff\" sometimes for a child I presume he cares about, because if he doesn't,  why is he marrying her mom?", "ESH\n\nIf it's been talked about and agreed by all parties that each parent pays for their own child, then she should be paying for Nia. However, you are not helping yourself and are placing her in a difficult position by refusing to co-operate with her and still picking expensive toys and activities. \n\nShe probably feels like she can't say no to an extent, because if the other kids are getting expensive toys and all these treats in the trip and Nia is not, it's going to single her out and make her feel left out. It also sounds like you don't accept her lower budget, making it feel like she can't suggest any alternative ideas. \n\nIf you ask her for a budget, you then need to accept and stick to the budget she sets. Don't disregard the number that she gives you. That's her boundary. For example, you say you expect her to pay if the things YOU want to do cost more, *'I would expect her to factor that in'*. If she's told you she can't afford a certain activity and you still go ahead and do it, then that's unfair.\n\n*'I would always try to work with her but it\u2019s not going to be a matter of me always paying for things that she can\u2019t'.*\n\nIf she says she can only afford $50, then that's the budget. You've got to adapt the things you do/ the activities to suit this, otherwise you risk excluding her kid. \n\nIf she says she can only afford McDonald's, then that's what she can afford. Don't then take them to a restaurant after she's told you this - you're disregarding her input entirely. If you're so against fast food, then use the money to buy ingredients and cook a meal. There's always ways of working around and compromising. \n\nSounds like a weird set up to me, but if it works for your family then it works. I think there needs to be a bit more communication and compromise.", "I\u2019m normally the same, when it\u2019s reciprocated. I\u2019m like that with all my friends. But Lisa never takes Sienna out, so this is not an even exchange", "Accept what budget? She\u2019s never set me a budget. She\u2019s been mad I didn\u2019t get the kids fast food but I\u2019ve told her many times I don\u2019t feed Sienna fast food and Ollie doesn\u2019t either so I don\u2019t know why she thinks that would change. \n\nI expect that if I tell her I plan to take the kids to an amusement park and the cost is \u20ac80 and her budget is \u20ac50, then I expect her to factor that into the decision of whether she lets Nia go, yes. As any parent would do. I don\u2019t decide to take the kids places because *I* find it fun, that\u2019s what they want to do. So if Sienna wants to go, and I think hey let me see if Will and Nia want to go, and Lisa can\u2019t afford it, that\u2019s not going to mean I then decide to scrap that plan and do something else, because the plan predates the invite. \n\nI am willing to work around her budget as much as I can. At the end of the day I could avoid all this and just see Will on his mum\u2019s custody time. She\u2019s my neighbour, we could just do it that way. I don\u2019t want to do that because it seems a ridiculous way to go about things, and I do think there\u2019s a middle ground to be found here.", "Okay but your brothers fianc\u00e9e isn\u2019t the same person as your brother\u2019s ex. If you never asked brothers fianc\u00e9e about this, then you were an AH to her. I think this time around, asking what she is willing to spend was a good move, but if you\u2019ve been asking for a lot of money from her without ever asking her permission to spend that money then you\u2019ve been an AH to her for a long time.\nAlso, maybe make it clear to her that whatever her spending limit is will be the same spending limit your child and your brothers child have for that day while they are together? And then you can sometimes take just your child and brothers child without his fianc\u00e9es child and spend more, but when fianc\u00e9es child is around spend less? It\u2019s not really nice to be spending a ton of money on your kid while also taking care of another kid who can\u2019t spend that much money\u2026", "Planning a group trip with a big shopping/spending component, where the other kids have an unlimited budget and are buying hundreds of euros worth of things, while Nia has a fast food-level budget of a few Euros and can\u2019t buy anything, is clearly going to make Nia feel uncomfortable. I\u2019m sure you can put yourself in her shoes and imagine how that feels. If you\u2019re planning a group trip for all the kids to bond, pick outings that are baseline affordable for everyone, where Nia wouldn\u2019t have to spend a lot of money to feel included.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean everyone has to leave spending the exact same amount. For example, if you take an affordable day trip and decide to stop by a gift shop briefly after lunch, it\u2019s ok for your and Ollie\u2019s kids to buy things within their budget while Nia buys things within Lisa\u2019s budget - school field trips do this all the time. The point is that everyone equally participated in the main outing, and everyone got to stop by the gift shop and have the opportunity to get something (whether it was cheap or expensive)\u2026but the shopping part wasn\u2019t dominating the trip.", "It\u2019s wasn\u2019t really a sign, because she would always say she would pay, and then she just wouldn\u2019t, or it would take her ages. And honestly I didn\u2019t know her that well in the beginning so I didn\u2019t want to be that person that\u2019s like \u201cdo you want to just set a budget beforehand because clearly you can\u2019t afford this\u201d, I was afraid no matter how gently I said it that\u2019s how it would come across. That\u2019s why I never pushed that hard when she\u2019d negotiate or I\u2019d ask Ollie to have a word. Now he\u2019s saying I should have been sterner but it really didn\u2019t feel appropriate at the time. And judging by how she took the conversation I\u2019ve tried to have with her after knowing her for two years, she wouldn\u2019t have taken it well after having known her for two months. \n\nBut for a while now it\u2019s just felt like she\u2019s taking advantage. Especially considering whenever she\u2019s out with my daughter, it\u2019s Ollie who pays. \n\nI could do that, I could just say well if she can\u2019t afford it then I will just only take Will out during his mum\u2019s custody time, we could do it that way. But like I said, by bringing it up with her I was trying to open the conversation and see how we could work on it and she just wasn\u2019t open to it.", ">But like I said, by bringing it up with her I was trying to open the conversation and see how we could work on it and she just wasn\u2019t open to it.\n\nBut you didn't open the conversation though. You didn't ask her about it. You made a decision by yourself and then presented her with your decision. When she didn't like your decision you excluded Nia. Hardly an open conversation.\n\nTo clarify I think Lisa is just at much at fault as you for not bringing it up or being clearer. And why the hell is your brother not acting like her husband(to be) and discussing things with her?", "If you don\u2019t believe in feeding kids fast food, but Nia\u2019s mom has made it clear that\u2019s the extent of her food budget for these outings, why are you inviting Nia on the trip and buying her more expensive food, and still expecting the mom to pay you the full amount? You already know she can\u2019t/won\u2019t.\n\nYour approach is not making sense to me. If I was considering a group trip to an amusement park, and I wanted parents to pay, I would tell all the parents the expected cost of the trip and get their agreement before we leave. You don\u2019t seem to be doing that, but are getting mad that Lisa doesn\u2019t pay whatever tab you chose to rack up, according to your preferences and priorities? I don\u2019t get it. She has not agreed to the same  blank check financial agreement you have with your brother and may not even be able to, if her budget is more limited. If I announce \u201cI\u2019m taking all the kids to an amusement park\u201d and don\u2019t take the step to get parental buy-in/agreement on the cost first, I should be ok with people seeing it as a gift or paying what they can. \n\nThe purpose of these outings is socializing and bonding, not spending X amount of money. If I knew one parent had a limited budget, and I wasn\u2019t interested in making up the difference for them, I\u2019d try to plan more group outings for everyone within that range.", "Ooookay, now you're starting to sound like TA...", "Ollie has spoken to her about it insofar as reminding her to pay me on several occasions. I guess he kind of thinks \u201cwell she\u2019s paying you eventually, if you want the full amount then don\u2019t bargain with her\u201d and thinks that should be the end of it. I don\u2019t know why he thinks it\u2019s my job to tell her no she can\u2019t use me like a personal credit card but then I don\u2019t see why she thinks that either.", "If Lisa can't afford to have Nia doing what the other kids are doing, Nia staying home is the solution.  It sucks, but that is reality.  OP shouldn't have to subsidize Nia or lower the budget of fun for the other kids just because Lisa can't afford it.", "Good point", "Okay, fair enough, maybe to avoid a confrontation I have done things ass backward up until now. But now that I\u2019m trying to do things differently, shes mad, I guess because the way things were before worked out better for her. \n\nIf my daughter says \u201cI want to go to the amusement park\u201d and I say yes, then decide to see if Will and Nia want to come and Lisa says it\u2019s not in her budget, I\u2019m not going to change the plan to go to the amusement park. The plan predates the invite. Lisa should just say no thanks maybe next time. She knows these things days in advance, and she still sends Nia knowing she\u2019s not going to pay for it. And again, say up until now it\u2019s been on me not to ask for the beforehand, okay I\u2019ll take that. But I\u2019m asking now, and now she\u2019s mad.", "I can understand the first time, but why did lisa  keeps asking op to babysit knowing she can't afford the same things? Lisa can keep her daughter with her instead of asking op to babysit", "OP can also plan outings that are at baseline within everyone\u2019s budget, and she/Ollie could give their kids money for optional extras (more expensive souvenirs, etc) if they want. \n\nIf the goal is for all the kids to bond, then some experiences should be accessible to everyone. \n\nIt\u2019s also ok for OP to plan some more expensive outings and Lisa can choose to not have Nia go on those. The point is the cost of each trip should be estimated and agreed on in advance.", "Actually, it kinda does. If you have a friend who is poorer than you either suggest outings they can afford, or subsidize them. To keep pressuring them to spend more than they can afford is a dick move.\n\nOP\u2019s brother sounds like he is trying to be Cinderella\u2019s stepfather"]}
