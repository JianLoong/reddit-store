Ollie has a son, Will (7) that he shares with his ex, while Lisa has a daughter, Nia (8) from her previous relationship. I have a daughter, Sienna (6). \n\nOver the past few weeks, I\u2019ve taken the kids out numerous places. The way it has always worked when I\u2019ve babysat Will is I take the kids out and then when I bring Will back I give Ollie or his ex an approximate cost for anything I bought while out and they pay me back. Obviously this is not a hard and fast rule, sometimes I will tell them not to worry about it if I\u2019ve bought lunch or small souvenirs but if Will comes back with something big, normally Ollie is insistent on paying me back for it. This works the same the other way round.\n\nI thought this would work the same with Lisa, but so far it hasn\u2019t. Since this holiday, and actually over the two years I\u2019ve known her, it either takes her a long time and several nagging reminders from my brother for her to pay me back, or she just doesn\u2019t. She will try to negotiate paying only a fraction of what is owed, saying she doesn\u2019t have the money and trying to make the costs my fault ie. Saying I should have taken the kids to fast food place instead of a restaurant. This has begun to get very irritating and I have found myself offering to take the kids out less because navigating the money with Lisa has become so awkward.\n\nMy husband and I are meant to take the kids out tomorrow, so last night I took Lisa aside and said to avoid any awkwardness, she should give me or Nia the amount of money she is happy to spend on the day upfront. That way, I know in advance what a comfortable budget is for her, and she doesn\u2019t have to worry about paying me back afterwards. Lisa got very offended and accused me of favouring the bio kids and singling out Nia. I said this had nothing to do with Nia, just Lisa herself, and that I was not happy to subsidise everything that Lisa doesn\u2019t feel like paying for after the fact. Lisa said this won\u2019t be fair because Nia won\u2019t be able to afford the souvenirs the other kids are getting and I said \u201cLisa you can\u2019t afford them now either, *I\u2019m* the one paying for everything\u201d. Lisa got very upset and said she would just pull Nia from the day out. \n\nMy husband says I did the right thing, my brother says I should have just been a bit stricter with Lisa about having to cough up and not asked her for the money upfront. I feel bad because now Nia is going to miss out on the outing and Ollie and Lisa don\u2019t get to spend the day alone but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to have to ask Lisa 7 times for money I spent on her kid. AITA?\n\nEdit: Ollie and Lisa keep their finances entirely separate, and they don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids. I was trying to be respectful of that by going to Lisa directly, because while Ollie does nudge Lisa to pay me back, I didn\u2019t think it was prudent to be asking him to pay me for Nia\u2019s expenses, knowing that that is not how they choose to do things.", "created_utc": 1692093372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ro7t0/aita_for_asking_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9_for_money/", "score": 2008, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were very considerate. Lisa is an embarrassed skinflint: your brother is trying to support her while recognising that she doesn't have a leg to stand on.\n\nThere must be an \"I went to X, and all I got was this lousy T-Shirt\" souvenir that you can get for Nia?", "NTA and you shouldnt be the middle person asking for it. Your brother should be paying you and then getting the money from Lisa.  Its his fiance, his future step kid and you are allowing them free time to be child free.\n\nAbsolutely do not take Lisa's kid out without money in advance or confirmation that your brother will pay up immediately like he does with his son.", "Are you officially babysitting them, or are you taking the initiative and asking them to go places with you and your kid because you are a nice aunt and you want your kid to hang with their cousins? Did you discuss the activities ahead of time with the parents, or do you go do what you want then expect them to pay whatever the cost is?  Do they take your kid places and pay? Or is it always one sided? When we invite a friend along with our kid, we pay for the friend, and the other parents do the same when our kid goes with them. These are for small activities that cost less than $40-$50. Something bigger like a giant amusement park then parents would send along money. You aren\u2019t the AH, but they aren\u2019t either. Don\u2019t invite other kids along if you don\u2019t expect to pay for them. I\u2019ve never asked another parent or relative to pay me back when I took their kid to dinner.\n\nEdit: in your original post you say Lisa said she didn\u2019t have the money. You can\u2019t be mad at somebody who has less than you and can\u2019t keep up with your lifestyle. You should be mad at your brother for treating his fianc\u00e9 as a second class citizen instead of an equal partner.

Lisa is the one responsible for this, not you.", "NTA, Lisa is and to some extend your brother is too. He is going to marry this woman and yet he wouldn't even pay for some souvenirs for his future stepdaughter that her mum can't afford? Asking a sister to be stricter with his future wife?

You are not obliged to spend money on your siblings, and Lisa has shown herself to be greedy and unreliable in paying bills afterward.\n\nNow she has to pay before.  Period.", "NTA. You can feel sorry for the kid, but this is entirely her mother's fault - so don't let anyone guilt-trip you into believing otherwise. Your approach was very reasonable.", "Info: Why not just ask your brother to pony up for both kids?", "NTA. Does she have money issues such as she is on a lower wage or struggles with bill payments?", "NTA. She's getting free babysitting and expecting you to pay for everything as well. Maybe it's time to ask your brother to cover for both kids and he can work out repayment with Lisa so it's not your problem anymore.", "NTA\n\nShe knows you subsidise her kids and is now upset that it's ending.", "Hard NTA, why is it OP\u2019s responsibility to ask Lisa for money when brother could have covered and ask Lisa back. Brother knows LISA WOULDN\u2019T PAY BACK!", "Agreed! Why is it OPs responsibility to chase for reimbursement from her brothers soon to be wife and soon to be step daughter? Why doesn't he pay?  Isn't he the one then favouring his bio kids?", "Yeah but if this situation happened more than once and she wasn't happy with being expected to pay whatever OP spent, the correct response is not to be passive aggressively difficult about paying her back and bleat about favoritism, it's to say at literally any point before they got to this situation that \"I can afford and will give you X amount of money, if you want to spend any extra that's on you\"", "Because it\u2019s their child? I love Will, obviously, but if we\u2019re at a shopping centre and he wants a \u20ac350 Lego set, I do kind of expect Ollie would want to pay me back for that? I buy Will gifts often and sometimes the kids do get stuff while we\u2019re out and I tell Ollie not to worry about it, tbh the gesture of him offering to pay me back speaks more than the actual money.", "He has told her, and when she doesn\u2019t pay he\u2019s the one who reminds her, but it just feels so messy.", "If I have a distinct plan like going to an amusement park, then yes I tell everyone what I\u2019m doing. If it\u2019s just a \u201chey let me take the kids for the day so you can have some time off\u201d and I don\u2019t have a concrete plan, then no. \n\nWhenever Ollie takes Sienna anywhere he pays, and like I said most of the time we don\u2019t bother asking for the money but for example if I take the kids out and we go to a shopping centre and Will wants something for the Lego store, I buy him the Lego and Ollie or his ex will see him with the Lego and be like \u201chey let me pay you back for that\u201d. Same with my kid. Ollie\u2019s ex takes Sienna shopping with her sometimes and Sienna will come back with a bunch of new stuff, I expect to pay it back. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going through receipts with fine tooth comb but there\u2019s a mutual trust there that things are kept somewhat fair.", "I know they keep separate finances so I thought talking to her about it directly was a bit more respectful than going to Ollie. But normally it\u2019s him nudging her to pay me back.", "He and Lisa keep their finances totally separate, so I am not expecting him to pay me back for Nia\u2019s stuff. He is the one always nudging Lisa to pay me back but obviously he feels I could be a bit sterner about her paying the whole amount etc", "Ollie and Lisa keep separate finances and don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids\u2019 things.", "I totally agree with you! The only thing I want to add is that OP should have done this from the start, or had a conversation with Lisa (Lisa was the SIL, right?) about it instead of just buying stuff and expecting the money back, cause that puts Lisa in a very awkward position if she doesn't have the funds. And it's not like she can say no don't buy my kid anything, and leave her kid out.\n\nBut Lisa could also have been a grown up and explained if she couldn't afford it the first couple of times it happened. \n\nI wanna say ESH really", "I would be so embarrassed if my family had to chase down my partner for money \u2014 especially for a favor as big as childcare.", "That\u2019s why I said Nta. But I can\u2019t imagine spending hundreds on a Lego set without asking the parents if they\u2019re ok with that kind of expense.", "Or you could just say no? \u20ac350 is a lot when you aren\u2019t expecting the expense.", "Taking other kids shopping is new territory for me. I don\u2019t take other (non-relative) kids shopping because I don\u2019t know the money situation of the other parents, and I don\u2019t want to make them feel obligated to pay me back (legos are expensive!) I prefer taking them to experiences (which may still include the gift shop). We\u2019ve spent more on birthday/Christmas presents for nieces/nephews than they have on our kid, but that is because our money situation is different and we don\u2019t mind being nice. Maybe ask yourself why you are letting yourself be so bothered by it (not a judgy thing, I do the same thing when I find myself getting angry over things like this, I should be having fun with the kids instead of getting angry with an adult)? Is the money you are spending on them preventing you from buying a necessity for your own family? Is this just one more thing on a list of things you don\u2019t like about Lisa? If you are a lot better off financially, maybe just let it go and let the cousins play with each other more, but don\u2019t take them shopping, or maybe impose a $10 limit for everybody.", "I could, but we\u2019ve never done it that way. There\u2019s always been an agreement between Ollie, me, and the spouses that this is how we do it. Lisa has been well aware of that for two years, if she wanted things handled differently she only had to say that. And me asking her to set the budget upfront was trying to help her do that.", "I don\u2019t take non relative kids shopping either, but Will is my relative so I have on occasion, same with Will\u2019s mother and Sienna. \n\nThe money is not preventing me from doing anything, except the prospect of this awkward dance around the money is making me offer to take Nia out less. There are no list of reasons I don\u2019t like Lisa, it\u2019s literally just this. I think making people chase you for money and trying to haggle over the money you pay someone back after the fact is really rude. At the end of the day, why didn\u2019t Lisa just give me the money in advance? Then she can set the budget she\u2019s comfortable with and we never have to talk about it again?", "You asking for a budget up front is why I said Nta. Otherwise you\u2019re spending a lot and then just expecting everyone is fine with it.", "Could you have her set the budget up front, and then have that be the budget for each of the kids?  You are obviously in the right about not wanting to subsidize her.  But I can also understand if she is concerned about her daughter watching the other kids get expensive things and feeling less-than.  Maybe you could explicitly plan on a cheaper outing all around so it feels more equitable and is something she can afford.  It could also help prevent the other kids from getting spoiled (not that they necessarily are, but young kids don\u2019t need to get EVERYTHING they want all the time).", "At this point maybe ask yourself is it worth it to punish the kids, and take away cousin time, to prove a point to Lisa about being equal. I don\u2019t understand why you are so focused on everything having to be so equal (it\u2019s not just you, I\u2019ve seen it as a trend on here). You are spending all this time, including the time invested in this post, focusing on Lisa and letting your anger build. This is time that can be spent thinking about positive things and improving yourself. You don\u2019t know Lisa\u2019s financial situation, she may be struggling to pay bills. If she is struggling with money, then I\u2019m sure she is aware and feels bad about it, but also wants her kid to be able to bond with family. Remember, you are family (or soon to be family), and will be spending the rest of your lives around each other, and the kids will hopefully form lifelong bonds from this time together  when they are young. Family is about love, not being equal. \nAlso, maybe buy your kid the expensive stuff when you are just with your immediate family. I just read in another post you spent a lot of money on a Lego set, that\u2019s on you! You can\u2019t spend that much then expect to be paid back.\n\nEdit: I thought we hated rich people and uncontrolled consumerism on Reddit, and we supported the less fortunate like Lisa. Now I realize that my money is my money, and I\u2019m not giving a dime to somebody who may need it, especially family members. Thank you for the update on how to think.", "Why does everything have to be (vaguely) equal? Is that a serious question? Because you can\u2019t just expect everyone else to pay for you all the time?", "Sometimes people are nice to those less fortunate than them.", "And if they are at a shopping center and the kids wants an expensive Lego set or toy, you say NO! You don\u2019t say yes then expect the parents to pay after the fact.", "I would say that effectively, your brother and Lisa are going to be married.  Will and Nia are going to be THEIR kids.  \n\nSure, if Will's mom's family is rich and buys him a car when he turns 16, they don't have to make that fair, because Will's mom's family has no obligation to Nia.  However, your brother and Lisa DO have an obligation to be fair to Will and Nia.   YOU do not have to be financially responsible for Will OR Nia.\n\nTell your brother, that from now on, if you take Will and Nia on an outing, you will expect to be given a budget and be reimbursed for both of their costs by him.  You should not be wrangling money out of your soon to be sister in law..  It is for him to work out with Lisa and she can pay him back, and they should be making sure that Will and Nia are treated fairly when they are on a family outing, because they are (or will be legally, very soon) family.  \n\nYou are just treating your niblings equally like a good aunt.", "Idk how this has not been clear throughout my other responses. Both Ollie, me, and our spouses have an agreement that it\u2019s fine to buy the kids things that they want, and we sort out the money later. We have done this since they were babies. \n\nIt is up to Lisa (because she KNOWS we do this) to tell me if Nia is not allowed to buy anything while out. She has never said a word about this. It\u2019s not like she sees Nia come back with something and says no sorry I can\u2019t pay for that you need to return it, or tells me in advance. No, she wants Nia to do exactly what the other two do, she just doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for the cost.", "Ollie and Lisa keep their finances separate, they don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids\u2019 stuff.\n\nETA : yes I could have said Ollie has to pay and he can get the money from Lisa but that felt disrespectful to her for me to go around her like that,especially knowing that they keep things separate. I was trying to be sensitive to that dynamic.", "Personally, I think they should re-evaluate this if they don't want resentment from both of the kids.  It is going to cause problems in their marriage. \n\nSure, maybe they aren't responsible for buying clothes and shoes and toys (outside of holiday/birthday) for each other's kids.  That's fine.  But for a family outing, they should be covering the costs as a family, divided however is appropriate based on income. \n\nEither Nia is going to resent Will and your brother for getting to do things Lisa can't afford, or Will is going to resent Nia and Lisa for always forcing outings to be scaled down to match Lisa's level of willingness to financially contribute.  \n\nHousehold expenses not being shared AT ALL is just going to be a nightmare to manage.  So are there going to be \"snacks for Nia\" and \"snacks for Will\" where they can't have each other's and they are going to get yelled at if they grab a granola bar from the wrong box?  When they make dinner do they make separate meals so they don't use \"each other's\" ingredients?  That just doesn't make any sense.  \n\nMost people I know who keep separate finances still have some amount of shared responsibility.  An engaged or married couple having to venmo each other constantly sounds exhausting.  A shared account for household expenses, groceries and family outings that they each contribute an agreed on amount to each month seems like a way less contentious arrangement.  I can't imagine having to nickel and dime my husband every day.  I would want to divorce just so I didn't have to do all of that accounting.  What a pain in the ass.", "You did say yourself that Lisa can\u2019t afford these outings. Maybe when you take the kids out all together, you take them to low or no cost places a little more often to balance it out? How often do you go to places with souvenirs??", "NAH, for now\n\nSeems to me there's a big social and/or cultural miscommunication here that I think will be hard to find compromise. \n\nLisa is of the mind that relatives who offer to spend time with her kid pay for all expenses while you feel that all expenses should be reimbursed by the parent. It's hard to find a medium ground because each side sees this situation very differently. \n\nUnfortunately, I think from now on you have to be very clear and set a new standard that if Lisa would like you to invite her kiddo then Lisa needs to give you the monetary budget before you leave with her kid OR if brother doesn't want to deal with the problems that might create, brother reimburses you for both kids. As awkward and crappy as that seems, you two are coming from very different points and compromise is the only way this can move forward if Lisa's daughter will also come along.", "NTA. What I am a little concerned about is that she has little money left over to pay for activities for her daughter when they share household expenses. Are those expenses split 50/50, and do they have comparable incomes? I am sure your brother would feel differently if their shared child and her child were the ones that could have activities, and he his other child excluded because he didn't have the funds. Blended families are difficult, and a marriage won't work if one of the children is excluded due to funds.", "NTA. Although it\u2019s a little ESH-ish, since this has happened more than once she\u2019s more to blame for not being proactive about this conversation.\n\nOn your end: IMO it\u2019s not appropriate to create a (variable, uncapped, non-emergency) debt for someone without their permission, and get upset when they don\u2019t pay it back according to your timeline. You and Ollie have created a blank check financial arrangement (that he initiated), where he pays you back for the (non-essential, non-emergency) things you choose to pay for for his kid, and that arrangement works for his financial situation. Maybe he has more money and so this type of open tab makes sense. You *assumed* that arrangement also would work for Lisa, but you didn\u2019t confirm that with her before you started racking up a tab for her, and then you get upset at her after the fact. That\u2019s not fair. She may in fact be in a more limited financial situation and not be able to afford what you\u2019re asking her to pay, and you didn\u2019t check with her before you decided to spend. Generally speaking: If I voluntarily choose to spend on someone without an advance agreement on the amount and an agreement to pay me back, I view it as a gift and do not feel entitled to be paid back. \n\nHowever: bc this was more than a one time occurrence, she also should have taken initiative to be clear about her financial boundaries instead of being passive and having you repeatedly asking her for money back. Fundamentally you\u2019re trying to do a nice thing by creating fun, inclusive social bonding opportunities for her kid, and the way she\u2019s handling this doesn\u2019t recognize that. It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s reciprocating with her own trips/outings either. That behavior is definitely entitled.\n\nShe does makes a valid point though, that the way you\u2019re suggesting to plan trips seems to be singling Nia out unnecessarily. If you are paying for things for the other two kids, but expecting Nia to carry money and pay for herself, IMO that\u2019s a very bizarre way to treat children. It would make much more sense for 1) every child to carry their own money (create a uniform policy), or imo even better 2) for you to ask Lisa for what budget is reasonable for her in advance and then plan trips within that budget for everyone. It would be totally fine to ask for payment in advance \u2014 would just be like any field trip.", "ESH\n\nHonestly this is such a weird situation to me. I can't imagine taking my nieces and nephews on a day out and asking my brother/sister to reimburse me. They're my family! If I wasn't willing to buy them lunch then I just wouldn't take them out. And if we're talking a much bigger purchase than lunch then why the hell would you allow a 7/8 year old to make such a big purchase, without consulting their parent first (whom you expect to pay for it)?!\n\nAnd now, rather than cancelling the trip you're going to let one kid miss out and make it clear to them that they're not a real part of the family.

So I'm covering tickets, gas and meals but I'm not buying video games and toy sets.", "I think the way I wrote it made it sound like I want every penny back, and that\u2019s simply not the case. Most of the time I do just swallow the cost, but mind you that\u2019s because Ollie/his ex do as well. And yes, we have an agreement to buy the kids what they want when we\u2019re out with each other\u2019s because in our minds, we\u2019re being saved a trip to the toy store. I don\u2019t mind if Sienna comes back with dolls after a day out, it\u2019s not like I wouldn\u2019t have bought them at some point anyway. I get that this might not work for everyone, but for us it\u2019s normal and simpler. \n\nMy thing is, Lisa has known this for two years. For two years, she\u2019s seen Ollie take my daughter out and buy her things and me pay him back and vice versa. She never came to me and said \u201cplease don\u2019t let Nia buy anything while you\u2019re at the shopping centre\u201d, nor did she say \u201cthis thing that Nia has come home with is out of my budget, could you please return it\u201d. She takes things, pretends she\u2019s fine with paying them, and then a few days later when I remind her, she starts saying she can\u2019t afford it. That for me is crossing a line. Or, she could tell Nia not to ask for things while out. I\u2019ve said that to my daughter, \u201cwhen you\u2019re out with (friend), I know you might want a toy or xyz but mummy\u2019s not there to pay for it, and friend\u2019s mummy isn\u2019t going to buy it for you, so just remember what it is and we can get it when it\u2019s just you and me\u201d. She has had these options for two years, and she had the option to just try and work with me when I spoke to her, but she has taken none of them. That leads me to believe that because everything is suiting her - not having to pay, or at worst only partially, that she\u2019s fine with that. \n\nIf Lisa said \u201cthis is my budget for the day\u201d, I would try to work around that where possible. That said, if I knew that budget wouldn\u2019t work ie. Wouldn\u2019t cover tickets for an amusement park etc then I would expect her to factor that in.

And from the sounds of it this seems to be a regular thing so you've potentially allowed a 7 year old to spend thousands of euros of their parents money, without consulting them!", "Then Ollie needs to not comment on how you get reimbursed. It seems he understands very well who he is marrying.", "Yeah, I agree.  When OP takes their kids out, spends as she chooses, and then expects reimbursement after the fact, she's basically spending *their* money--and apparently spending more than Lisa wants to.

In hindsight perhaps it only continued to work because when Ollie and Lisa take the kids, Ollie is the one paying for Sienna\u2019s stuff, not Lisa.

At the end of the day, I am 100% willing to work with Lisa within reason, that\u2019s what I was trying to do by eliminating the awkwardness, and I feel like she made it clear she doesn\u2019t want to reach a compromise by walking off in a huff.", "Because my brother and his ex have said in advance that they don\u2019t mind.

It's not fair to exclude Nia and make her feel bad, she's done nothing wrong.", "I'd say NTA because you have a particular standing arrangement with your brother, but just for myself I have to point out that this is the whackiest arrangement I've ever heard of.  If someone offered to take my kid out for the day and they came back with a \u20ac350 gift \"from aunty\" that I was then expected to pay for - along with the expenses of the day out - without knowing about this in advance, I'd be resistant to paying too.  And you'd probably never see my kid again.", ">If she was unhappy at any point, she could have said that to me?\n\nIt sounds like she **has** been doing that.

Asking her for money upfront *in private* was exactly the way to address her behaviour.  \n\nIf your brother has an issue then you should suggest he gives you money upfront and that he then asks Lisa to pay him back instead. That way Lisa is still paying pack instead of paying upfront.

Will he spend more on his bio child? Not have the step child go places? \n\nAlso presumably brother's bio child has a bio mother who might be taking the bio child for experiences that the step child might not have.\n\nIn my opinion, it is a very sneaky passive aggressive way for the brother to get OP to cover costs that BROTHER should be paying for if Lisa can't afford to cover them.", "I agree abt lisa. But i think the brother caused this by putting his sister in an awkward situ.", "I agree NTA. Maybe ask as a group what the spending limit could be for each so no one gets too much more than the others.\n\nFully agree it is not OP problem to be stricter with Lisa.

I can understand how it could be a problem early on if OP and their family have a precedent of this kind of spending and a general feel for how much they can reasonably spend on an outing that Lisa wasn't prepared for or couldn't match. But when OP tactfully asked for a budget ahead of time the argument was that \"Nia wouldn't be able to afford what the other kids are getting\" ... which indicates Lisa isn't viewing this as a budgeting issue but rather wanting her kid to get as much as the other kids but without having to pay for it.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Your brother should pay you.

Is teenage Nephew going to to have a brand new car paid for by Daddy, while Lisa's daughter will be riding the bus? \n\nThat's how you create a household full of resentment. I get that nephew seems to have both parents in his life to pay for things and maybe Lisa's baby daddy is useless, but they cant ignore the elephant in the room and expect things to run smoothly.

However, you are not helping yourself and are placing her in a difficult position by refusing to co-operate with her and still picking expensive toys and activities. \n\nShe probably feels like she can't say no to an extent, because if the other kids are getting expensive toys and all these treats in the trip and Nia is not, it's going to single her out and make her feel left out. It also sounds like you don't accept her lower budget, making it feel like she can't suggest any alternative ideas. \n\nIf you ask her for a budget, you then need to accept and stick to the budget she sets. Don't disregard the number that she gives you. That's her boundary. For example, you say you expect her to pay if the things YOU want to do cost more, *'I would expect her to factor that in'*. If she's told you she can't afford a certain activity and you still go ahead and do it, then that's unfair.\n\n*'I would always try to work with her but it\u2019s not going to be a matter of me always paying for things that she can\u2019t'.*\n\nIf she says she can only afford $50, then that's the budget. You've got to adapt the things you do/ the activities to suit this, otherwise you risk excluding her kid. \n\nIf she says she can only afford McDonald's, then that's what she can afford. Don't then take them to a restaurant after she's told you this - you're disregarding her input entirely. If you're so against fast food, then use the money to buy ingredients and cook a meal. There's always ways of working around and compromising. \n\nSounds like a weird set up to me, but if it works for your family then it works. I think there needs to be a bit more communication and compromise.", "I\u2019m normally the same, when it\u2019s reciprocated. I\u2019m like that with all my friends.

And then you can sometimes take just your child and brothers child without his fianc\u00e9es child and spend more, but when fianc\u00e9es child is around spend less?

I\u2019m sure you can put yourself in her shoes and imagine how that feels.

For example, if you take an affordable day trip and decide to stop by a gift shop briefly after lunch, it\u2019s ok for your and Ollie\u2019s kids to buy things within their budget while Nia buys things within Lisa\u2019s budget - school field trips do this all the time. The point is that everyone equally participated in the main outing, and everyone got to stop by the gift shop and have the opportunity to get something (whether it was cheap or expensive)\u2026but the shopping part wasn\u2019t dominating the trip.", "It\u2019s wasn\u2019t really a sign, because she would always say she would pay, and then she just wouldn\u2019t, or it would take her ages.

You didn't ask her about it. You made a decision by yourself and then presented her with your decision. When she didn't like your decision you excluded Nia. Hardly an open conversation.\n\nTo clarify I think Lisa is just at much at fault as you for not bringing it up or being clearer. And why the hell is your brother not acting like her husband(to be) and discussing things with her?", "If you don\u2019t believe in feeding kids fast food, but Nia\u2019s mom has made it clear that\u2019s the extent of her food budget for these outings, why are you inviting Nia on the trip and buying her more expensive food, and still expecting the mom to pay you the full amount? You already know she can\u2019t/won\u2019t.\n\nYour approach is not making sense to me. If I was considering a group trip to an amusement park, and I wanted parents to pay, I would tell all the parents the expected cost of the trip and get their agreement before we leave. You don\u2019t seem to be doing that, but are getting mad that Lisa doesn\u2019t pay whatever tab you chose to rack up, according to your preferences and priorities? I don\u2019t get it.

Let\u2019s think about what would be the most inclusive and kindest thing for these cousin relationships. It sounds like you have no problem paying for lunch or smaller expenses as these are paid for your daughter when another adult takes her on cousin time. Perhaps you\u2019re affording nicer places, but it\u2019s equitable as long as they all are eating. So the main issue seems to be buying souvenirs and toys. How about planning outings that aren\u2019t so consumeristic? I realize it\u2019s different from what\u2019s been done before, and you feel it saves you both trips, but there are a million things to do with kids that don\u2019t require buying new things. Free days at museums and zoos, going on nature walks, or low cost activities like getting an ice cream or chalking on the drive way etc. \n\nWhen I was a kid, my cousins were more well off than me and I had to go to the toy store with them many times and get nothing or something tiny compared to what they were getting.

OP was looking for a compromise, one where she can plan around Lisa\u2019s budget without having to push to be payed back.\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous that OP was told to just \u201cbe more strict\u201d with Lisa about payment. Clearly that doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s not like OP can get money out of Lisa\u2019s bank or purse, Lisa has to be the one to pay the money back. Lisa doesn\u2019t want less money being spent on her kid, but doesn\u2019t want to pay\u2026 it doesn\u2019t work like that. If she doesn\u2019t want her kid being limited by a budget then she can talk with her fianc\u00e9 and see if they can work something out between the two of them. That would be between them though, OP is not responsible for paying for someone else\u2019s child.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "It also means that OP can potentially find activities where Lisa\u2019s kid isn\u2019t upset about not being able to afford what the other kids are able to buy. OP seems like someone who would be understanding enough to not put any of the kids in situations that foster jealousy or discomfort between them.", "Yeah this set up is weird to me. If I'm taking out my kids with their cousins or friends I expect to pay for everyone since young kids obviously don't have money and I am \"the host\".\n\nTypically I don't do expensive activities as I definitely don't want to foot the bill for 4-5 kids. Kids can have fun together at the park and you can pack nice snacks/treats instead of blowing $30 at the ice cream truck.\n\nLisa doesn't sound great but it doesn't seem like she has money to do these pricey activities OP is suggesting. IMO brother comes off the worst here - he is taking split finances too far. I can understand separate college funds, but you're really going to let your step daughter go without small luxuries like zoo outings and souvenirs (that your son gets) because your wife makes little money. So miserly and cold.", "I wouldn't just get a 6-8yo some Lego that they decide they want on the spot unless I was willing to pay for it myself. Otherwise it'd be: you know what, why don't you ask your parents to get it for birthday/Christmas/upcoming holiday - it's perfectly okay to not give a child whatever they want just because they want them, and an unplanned shopping spree with a 'bunch of new stuff' that the parents didn't approve/agreed to pay...  nope. \nYour solution was reasonable but it's true that the child would feel singled out. 'sorry you cannot have random useless stuff, see whathisface's dad will pay me back if I buy this and your mom won't. so... tough luck' - at this age, kids could start getting pocket money and start to manage it so they can save up for a big value item (Lego) or spend it on ice cream and keychains, so that's an idea.", "Do you ask his dad if it\u2019s appropriate to buy him something for that amount of money?

I work with a lot of kids and there are many parents who don\u2019t/aren\u2019t able to take their kids out like you are with yours. It\u2019s great that you include Will/Nia too.

They (the affluent spouse included) won't spend less on the blood-related children, and resent the idea of spending on the step-child so that they're not treated as second-class.\n\nBeen a little while since the last one I saw, now that I think about it!\n\nETA: lol, like clockwork.

Getting the toys is not an appeasement tactic, both Will and Sienna are well behaved children with a lot of structure and discipline and they\u2019re perfectly fine if anyone says no. However, where we find it appropriate, we like to say yes. I get that that\u2019s not how everyone sees it but that\u2019s something that has worked out for us thus far. Our kids are not entitled, neither one of them has ever thrown a tantrum, and they\u2019re very grateful for everything that they get, even if that happens to look like a lot to some people. \n\nI understand what you\u2019re saying and probably in some instances it would feel that way. Lisa always has the option to pick and choose what Nia comes to, though. I was just trying to offer her some kind of solution to what is an awkward situation for me and I\u2019m sure it is for her, too.

If Lisa can only give Nia $25 for the day and your kid gets $150, that's really unfair.", "INFO: Does Lisa struggle financially? If yes, then I'm going with a soft ESH. Obviously the way she responded to you and has generally been taking advantage of your generosity, 100% makes her TA (and if she does not have financial issues, then you are definitely NTA). However the reason I'm a soft ESH is because I was the poor kid growing up in a wealthier town, and I was VERY aware of it. It was always awkward and uncomfortable when I would go out with friends and had a smaller budget. I would always order the cheapest food on the menu, or pretend I wasn't hungry, or if I was the one making the plans, I would suggest doing something at one of our houses or something very cheap that I could actually afford to kind of level the playing field so to speak. My point being that if Lisa does struggle financially and you know that some of the things you like to do with the kids are more expensive, you should be offering to do activities that she can actually afford. That way Nia doesn't have to get left out of the experience because her mom can't afford the activity or event you chose, or that way if she can go, she doesn't get an unequal experience (such as you buying your and your brother's kids expensive souvenirs and Nia only having a $20 budget). However if you do want to do the more expensive activities and want Nia to be able to go, you either need to be prepared to pick-up some of the tab, or encourage your brother to have a talk with Lisa about their finances, and for him to be willing to pay for these particular outings (since Nia is going to be his stepdaughter anyway). For example, one of my friends growing up brought me to Florida with her family over spring break one year. She and her brother were both allowed to invite a friend, and I just assumed (I was in middle school and still a little naive) that their parents were picking up the entire tab for everyone. However, when we were on our way there, I remember overhearing that the parents of the brother's friend had given my friend's parents over $700 to help cover his costs of the trip, yet my friend's parents never asked my mom or I to contribute anything. I was absolutely mortified at that point and tried to cost them as little money as possible, but they still made sure to include me in all the activities, and even encouraged me to do some when they could probably tell I was holding back because of the cost. My mom gave me as much spending money as she could, but it still wasn't much, so this family (even the grandparents) bought some fun things/souvenirs.\nAnyway, that's a long winded way of me trying to explain that while I do think the way you approached Lisa was respectful and with good intentions, from my experience of being poor, I think you could have potentially worded it a little differently, or should have talked to her before even planning the outing to find out what kind of activities she could afford to begin with. Also try to understand that some of her response could have come from a place of embarrassment, shame, and a general feeling of inadequacy at not being able to afford these things, especially if she is not used to having a smaller budget than everyone around her (it's a hard adjustment).\nBut if I have this wrong and there are no financial issues at all for Lisa, then you are absolutely and completely NTA for being frustrated with her entitlement and wanting compensation ahead of time. \nDespite being as poor as we were, my mom and I were ALWAYS grateful for any help we received, and we NEVER felt entitled to anyone's generosity (if anything, I often felt guilty accepting it). So even if Lisa is having money troubles, she definitely could have handled this in a more polite and gracious manner. And if money is an issue, then you should try to start figuring out cheap or free activities that all the kids can participate in.", "If Ollie doesn't want you to ask Lisa for the money upfront, then he needs to pay what she already owes you, agree to pay after the fact for this outing, and then he can worry about getting the money from her.

Unfortunately if you want Nia to go places and have souvenirs that Lisa can\u2019t afford then someone else is going to have to pay. Lisa may also be feeling some resentment towards OP and guild in general about Nia going places and buying things she herself can\u2019t afford, maybe feeling pressure from this and not be able to say no. OP probably needs to have an honest discussion about this and maybe come to a compromise where neither party feels used. Lisa may well be glad that the financial pressure will be taken off if Nia does not go on any more trips.", "She may be ashamed she even has to tell you that. If I had to caution my fiance's sister about what she should spend on my child compared to her own and her nephew because I can't pay it back, I'd feel like I can't properly provide an enjoyable childhood for her. Having to watch other kids you live close enough with be able to do all those things while you can't because your mom cannot afford them for you *will* affect the child. Every-three-weeks trips like those described would've been out of budget when I was growing up, and I developed a sense of urgency and anxiety around money from other experiences. The fianc\u00e9's kid could do the same. Without knowing her income, I can't really judge, but if you can afford those trips it's more props to you, being able to give your own kid and nephew those experiences is a very good thing. It's NAH for me, just find a way to resolve it without making the kids feel the pressure.", "Lisa may feel under pressure not to rock the boat about budgeting issues.", "Ok, she never set a budget, fair enough. But she has told you she can't afford some of the things you currently do, so you have a rough idea. I do think she should be transparent and give you an idea of a budget/ what she can afford, but you've got to be willing to work with this too.\n\nIf the kids want to go to expensive places, then you might have to manage their expectations. You can say no. There's plenty of activities that are still fun that don't cost a lot. If you still want to go to places that Lisa can't afford, then that's fine, but you'll be purposely excluding Nia, which feels like punishing her for something she's not done and has no control over. You could save the expensive activities and do them less frequently. \n\nI agree, there's definitely a middle ground. It would be a shame to upset the relationship between all the kids over this. It sounds like everyone needs to communicate what their expectations are regarding the trips and the costs involved.", "There is a big difference between babysitting nibblings when asked, which is when expenses should be agreed in advance and covered. And offering to rake them on a fun day out - that's on you.  I would never offer to take out my nieces and nephews and come back with a pile of receipts for restaurants and gifts. However when asked the parents should offer to cover costs,  out of gratitude. Two very different situations.  Also, it's OK for kids to just hang out, go to the park, eat at home etc.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t offer to take her kid out again if you\u2019re not going to get any money back from jt", "NTA and this is your way to be stricter, just telling her doesn't work clearly and she has been ungrateful about it", "OP is asking for a budget now and she got upset over that. I don't get it, you want OP to stick to Lisa's budget but Lisa didn't want to give one and is mad she is being asked for one"]}
