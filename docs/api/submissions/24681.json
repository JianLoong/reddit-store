Ollie has a son, Will (7) that he shares with his ex, while Lisa has a daughter, Nia (8) from her previous relationship. I have a daughter, Sienna (6). \n\nOver the past few weeks, I\u2019ve taken the kids out numerous places. The way it has always worked when I\u2019ve babysat Will is I take the kids out and then when I bring Will back I give Ollie or his ex an approximate cost for anything I bought while out and they pay me back. Obviously this is not a hard and fast rule, sometimes I will tell them not to worry about it if I\u2019ve bought lunch or small souvenirs but if Will comes back with something big, normally Ollie is insistent on paying me back for it. This works the same the other way round.\n\nI thought this would work the same with Lisa, but so far it hasn\u2019t. Since this holiday, and actually over the two years I\u2019ve known her, it either takes her a long time and several nagging reminders from my brother for her to pay me back, or she just doesn\u2019t. She will try to negotiate paying only a fraction of what is owed, saying she doesn\u2019t have the money and trying to make the costs my fault ie. Saying I should have taken the kids to fast food place instead of a restaurant. This has begun to get very irritating and I have found myself offering to take the kids out less because navigating the money with Lisa has become so awkward.\n\nMy husband and I are meant to take the kids out tomorrow, so last night I took Lisa aside and said to avoid any awkwardness, she should give me or Nia the amount of money she is happy to spend on the day upfront. That way, I know in advance what a comfortable budget is for her, and she doesn\u2019t have to worry about paying me back afterwards. Lisa got very offended and accused me of favouring the bio kids and singling out Nia. I said this had nothing to do with Nia, just Lisa herself, and that I was not happy to subsidise everything that Lisa doesn\u2019t feel like paying for after the fact. Lisa said this won\u2019t be fair because Nia won\u2019t be able to afford the souvenirs the other kids are getting and I said \u201cLisa you can\u2019t afford them now either, *I\u2019m* the one paying for everything\u201d. Lisa got very upset and said she would just pull Nia from the day out. \n\nMy husband says I did the right thing, my brother says I should have just been a bit stricter with Lisa about having to cough up and not asked her for the money upfront. I feel bad because now Nia is going to miss out on the outing and Ollie and Lisa don\u2019t get to spend the day alone but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for me to have to ask Lisa 7 times for money I spent on her kid. AITA?\n\nEdit: Ollie and Lisa keep their finances entirely separate, and they don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids. I was trying to be respectful of that by going to Lisa directly, because while Ollie does nudge Lisa to pay me back, I didn\u2019t think it was prudent to be asking him to pay me for Nia\u2019s expenses, knowing that that is not how they choose to do things.", "created_utc": 1692093372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ro7t0/aita_for_asking_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9_for_money/", "score": 486, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother should be paying you and then getting the money from Lisa.  Its his fiance, his future step kid and you are allowing them free time to be child free.\n\nAbsolutely do not take Lisa's kid out without money in advance or confirmation that your brother will pay up immediately like he does with his son.", "Are you officially babysitting them, or are you taking the initiative and asking them to go places with you and your kid because you are a nice aunt and you want your kid to hang with their cousins? Did you discuss the activities ahead of time with the parents, or do you go do what you want then expect them to pay whatever the cost is?  Do they take your kid places and pay? Or is it always one sided? When we invite a friend along with our kid, we pay for the friend, and the other parents do the same when our kid goes with them. These are for small activities that cost less than $40-$50. Something bigger like a giant amusement park then parents would send along money. You aren\u2019t the AH, but they aren\u2019t either. Don\u2019t invite other kids along if you don\u2019t expect to pay for them. I\u2019ve never asked another parent or relative to pay me back when I took their kid to dinner.\n\nEdit: in your original post you say Lisa said she didn\u2019t have the money. You can\u2019t be mad at somebody who has less than you and can\u2019t keep up with your lifestyle. You should be mad at your brother for treating his fianc\u00e9 as a second class citizen instead of an equal partner.

Lisa is the one responsible for this, not you.", "NTA, Lisa is and to some extend your brother is too. He is going to marry this woman and yet he wouldn't even pay for some souvenirs for his future stepdaughter that her mum can't afford? Asking a sister to be stricter with his future wife?

You can feel sorry for the kid, but this is entirely her mother's fault - so don't let anyone guilt-trip you into believing otherwise. Your approach was very reasonable.", "Info: Why not just ask your brother to pony up for both kids?", "NTA. Does she have money issues such as she is on a lower wage or struggles with bill payments?", "NTA. She's getting free babysitting and expecting you to pay for everything as well.

Brother knows LISA WOULDN\u2019T PAY BACK!", "Agreed! Why is it OPs responsibility to chase for reimbursement from her brothers soon to be wife and soon to be step daughter? Why doesn't he pay?  Isn't he the one then favouring his bio kids?", "Yeah but if this situation happened more than once and she wasn't happy with being expected to pay whatever OP spent, the correct response is not to be passive aggressively difficult about paying her back and bleat about favoritism, it's to say at literally any point before they got to this situation that \"I can afford and will give you X amount of money, if you want to spend any extra that's on you\"", "Because it\u2019s their child? I love Will, obviously, but if we\u2019re at a shopping centre and he wants a \u20ac350 Lego set, I do kind of expect Ollie would want to pay me back for that? I buy Will gifts often and sometimes the kids do get stuff while we\u2019re out and I tell Ollie not to worry about it, tbh the gesture of him offering to pay me back speaks more than the actual money.", "He has told her, and when she doesn\u2019t pay he\u2019s the one who reminds her, but it just feels so messy.", "If I have a distinct plan like going to an amusement park, then yes I tell everyone what I\u2019m doing. If it\u2019s just a \u201chey let me take the kids for the day so you can have some time off\u201d and I don\u2019t have a concrete plan, then no. \n\nWhenever Ollie takes Sienna anywhere he pays, and like I said most of the time we don\u2019t bother asking for the money but for example if I take the kids out and we go to a shopping centre and Will wants something for the Lego store, I buy him the Lego and Ollie or his ex will see him with the Lego and be like \u201chey let me pay you back for that\u201d. Same with my kid. Ollie\u2019s ex takes Sienna shopping with her sometimes and Sienna will come back with a bunch of new stuff, I expect to pay it back. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going through receipts with fine tooth comb but there\u2019s a mutual trust there that things are kept somewhat fair.", "I know they keep separate finances so I thought talking to her about it directly was a bit more respectful than going to Ollie. But normally it\u2019s him nudging her to pay me back.", "He and Lisa keep their finances totally separate, so I am not expecting him to pay me back for Nia\u2019s stuff. He is the one always nudging Lisa to pay me back but obviously he feels I could be a bit sterner about her paying the whole amount etc", "Ollie and Lisa keep separate finances and don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids\u2019 things.", "I totally agree with you! The only thing I want to add is that OP should have done this from the start, or had a conversation with Lisa (Lisa was the SIL, right?) about it instead of just buying stuff and expecting the money back, cause that puts Lisa in a very awkward position if she doesn't have the funds. And it's not like she can say no don't buy my kid anything, and leave her kid out.\n\nBut Lisa could also have been a grown up and explained if she couldn't afford it the first couple of times it happened. \n\nI wanna say ESH really", "I would be so embarrassed if my family had to chase down my partner for money \u2014 especially for a favor as big as childcare.", "That\u2019s why I said Nta. But I can\u2019t imagine spending hundreds on a Lego set without asking the parents if they\u2019re ok with that kind of expense.", "Or you could just say no? \u20ac350 is a lot when you aren\u2019t expecting the expense.", "Taking other kids shopping is new territory for me. I don\u2019t take other (non-relative) kids shopping because I don\u2019t know the money situation of the other parents, and I don\u2019t want to make them feel obligated to pay me back (legos are expensive!) I prefer taking them to experiences (which may still include the gift shop). We\u2019ve spent more on birthday/Christmas presents for nieces/nephews than they have on our kid, but that is because our money situation is different and we don\u2019t mind being nice. Maybe ask yourself why you are letting yourself be so bothered by it (not a judgy thing, I do the same thing when I find myself getting angry over things like this, I should be having fun with the kids instead of getting angry with an adult)? Is the money you are spending on them preventing you from buying a necessity for your own family? Is this just one more thing on a list of things you don\u2019t like about Lisa? If you are a lot better off financially, maybe just let it go and let the cousins play with each other more, but don\u2019t take them shopping, or maybe impose a $10 limit for everybody.", "I could, but we\u2019ve never done it that way. There\u2019s always been an agreement between Ollie, me, and the spouses that this is how we do it. Lisa has been well aware of that for two years, if she wanted things handled differently she only had to say that. And me asking her to set the budget upfront was trying to help her do that.", "I don\u2019t take non relative kids shopping either, but Will is my relative so I have on occasion, same with Will\u2019s mother and Sienna. \n\nThe money is not preventing me from doing anything, except the prospect of this awkward dance around the money is making me offer to take Nia out less. There are no list of reasons I don\u2019t like Lisa, it\u2019s literally just this. I think making people chase you for money and trying to haggle over the money you pay someone back after the fact is really rude. At the end of the day, why didn\u2019t Lisa just give me the money in advance? Then she can set the budget she\u2019s comfortable with and we never have to talk about it again?", "You asking for a budget up front is why I said Nta. Otherwise you\u2019re spending a lot and then just expecting everyone is fine with it.", "Could you have her set the budget up front, and then have that be the budget for each of the kids?  You are obviously in the right about not wanting to subsidize her.  But I can also understand if she is concerned about her daughter watching the other kids get expensive things and feeling less-than.  Maybe you could explicitly plan on a cheaper outing all around so it feels more equitable and is something she can afford.  It could also help prevent the other kids from getting spoiled (not that they necessarily are, but young kids don\u2019t need to get EVERYTHING they want all the time).", "At this point maybe ask yourself is it worth it to punish the kids, and take away cousin time, to prove a point to Lisa about being equal. I don\u2019t understand why you are so focused on everything having to be so equal (it\u2019s not just you, I\u2019ve seen it as a trend on here). You are spending all this time, including the time invested in this post, focusing on Lisa and letting your anger build. This is time that can be spent thinking about positive things and improving yourself. You don\u2019t know Lisa\u2019s financial situation, she may be struggling to pay bills. If she is struggling with money, then I\u2019m sure she is aware and feels bad about it, but also wants her kid to be able to bond with family. Remember, you are family (or soon to be family), and will be spending the rest of your lives around each other, and the kids will hopefully form lifelong bonds from this time together  when they are young. Family is about love, not being equal. \nAlso, maybe buy your kid the expensive stuff when you are just with your immediate family. I just read in another post you spent a lot of money on a Lego set, that\u2019s on you! You can\u2019t spend that much then expect to be paid back.", "Why does everything have to be (vaguely) equal? Is that a serious question? Because you can\u2019t just expect everyone else to pay for you all the time?", "Sometimes people are nice to those less fortunate than them.", "And if they are at a shopping center and the kids wants an expensive Lego set or toy, you say NO! You don\u2019t say yes then expect the parents to pay after the fact.", "I would say that effectively, your brother and Lisa are going to be married.  Will and Nia are going to be THEIR kids.  \n\nSure, if Will's mom's family is rich and buys him a car when he turns 16, they don't have to make that fair, because Will's mom's family has no obligation to Nia.  However, your brother and Lisa DO have an obligation to be fair to Will and Nia.   YOU do not have to be financially responsible for Will OR Nia.\n\nTell your brother, that from now on, if you take Will and Nia on an outing, you will expect to be given a budget and be reimbursed for both of their costs by him.  You should not be wrangling money out of your soon to be sister in law..  It is for him to work out with Lisa and she can pay him back, and they should be making sure that Will and Nia are treated fairly when they are on a family outing, because they are (or will be legally, very soon) family.  \n\nYou are just treating your niblings equally like a good aunt.", "Idk how this has not been clear throughout my other responses. Both Ollie, me, and our spouses have an agreement that it\u2019s fine to buy the kids things that they want, and we sort out the money later. We have done this since they were babies. \n\nIt is up to Lisa (because she KNOWS we do this) to tell me if Nia is not allowed to buy anything while out. She has never said a word about this. It\u2019s not like she sees Nia come back with something and says no sorry I can\u2019t pay for that you need to return it, or tells me in advance. No, she wants Nia to do exactly what the other two do, she just doesn\u2019t want to be responsible for the cost.", "Ollie and Lisa keep their finances separate, they don\u2019t pay for each other\u2019s kids\u2019 stuff.\n\nETA : yes I could have said Ollie has to pay and he can get the money from Lisa but that felt disrespectful to her for me to go around her like that,especially knowing that they keep things separate. I was trying to be sensitive to that dynamic.", "Personally, I think they should re-evaluate this if they don't want resentment from both of the kids.  It is going to cause problems in their marriage. \n\nSure, maybe they aren't responsible for buying clothes and shoes and toys (outside of holiday/birthday) for each other's kids.  That's fine.  But for a family outing, they should be covering the costs as a family, divided however is appropriate based on income. \n\nEither Nia is going to resent Will and your brother for getting to do things Lisa can't afford, or Will is going to resent Nia and Lisa for always forcing outings to be scaled down to match Lisa's level of willingness to financially contribute.  \n\nHousehold expenses not being shared AT ALL is just going to be a nightmare to manage.  So are there going to be \"snacks for Nia\" and \"snacks for Will\" where they can't have each other's and they are going to get yelled at if they grab a granola bar from the wrong box?  When they make dinner do they make separate meals so they don't use \"each other's\" ingredients?  That just doesn't make any sense.  \n\nMost people I know who keep separate finances still have some amount of shared responsibility.  An engaged or married couple having to venmo each other constantly sounds exhausting.  A shared account for household expenses, groceries and family outings that they each contribute an agreed on amount to each month seems like a way less contentious arrangement.  I can't imagine having to nickel and dime my husband every day.  I would want to divorce just so I didn't have to do all of that accounting.  What a pain in the ass.", "You did say yourself that Lisa can\u2019t afford these outings. Maybe when you take the kids out all together, you take them to low or no cost places a little more often to balance it out? How often do you go to places with souvenirs??", "NAH, for now\n\nSeems to me there's a big social and/or cultural miscommunication here that I think will be hard to find compromise. \n\nLisa is of the mind that relatives who offer to spend time with her kid pay for all expenses while you feel that all expenses should be reimbursed by the parent. It's hard to find a medium ground because each side sees this situation very differently. \n\nUnfortunately, I think from now on you have to be very clear and set a new standard that if Lisa would like you to invite her kiddo then Lisa needs to give you the monetary budget before you leave with her kid OR if brother doesn't want to deal with the problems that might create, brother reimburses you for both kids. As awkward and crappy as that seems, you two are coming from very different points and compromise is the only way this can move forward if Lisa's daughter will also come along.", "NTA. What I am a little concerned about is that she has little money left over to pay for activities for her daughter when they share household expenses. Are those expenses split 50/50, and do they have comparable incomes? I am sure your brother would feel differently if their shared child and her child were the ones that could have activities, and he his other child excluded because he didn't have the funds. Blended families are difficult, and a marriage won't work if one of the children is excluded due to funds.", "NTA. Although it\u2019s a little ESH-ish, since this has happened more than once she\u2019s more to blame for not being proactive about this conversation.\n\nOn your end: IMO it\u2019s not appropriate to create a (variable, uncapped, non-emergency) debt for someone without their permission, and get upset when they don\u2019t pay it back according to your timeline. You and Ollie have created a blank check financial arrangement (that he initiated), where he pays you back for the (non-essential, non-emergency) things you choose to pay for for his kid, and that arrangement works for his financial situation. Maybe he has more money and so this type of open tab makes sense. You *assumed* that arrangement also would work for Lisa, but you didn\u2019t confirm that with her before you started racking up a tab for her, and then you get upset at her after the fact. That\u2019s not fair. She may in fact be in a more limited financial situation and not be able to afford what you\u2019re asking her to pay, and you didn\u2019t check with her before you decided to spend. Generally speaking: If I voluntarily choose to spend on someone without an advance agreement on the amount and an agreement to pay me back, I view it as a gift and do not feel entitled to be paid back. \n\nHowever: bc this was more than a one time occurrence, she also should have taken initiative to be clear about her financial boundaries instead of being passive and having you repeatedly asking her for money back. Fundamentally you\u2019re trying to do a nice thing by creating fun, inclusive social bonding opportunities for her kid, and the way she\u2019s handling this doesn\u2019t recognize that. It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s reciprocating with her own trips/outings either. That behavior is definitely entitled.\n\nShe does makes a valid point though, that the way you\u2019re suggesting to plan trips seems to be singling Nia out unnecessarily. If you are paying for things for the other two kids, but expecting Nia to carry money and pay for herself, IMO that\u2019s a very bizarre way to treat children. It would make much more sense for 1) every child to carry their own money (create a uniform policy), or imo even better 2) for you to ask Lisa for what budget is reasonable for her in advance and then plan trips within that budget for everyone. It would be totally fine to ask for payment in advance \u2014 would just be like any field trip.", "ESH\n\nHonestly this is such a weird situation to me. I can't imagine taking my nieces and nephews on a day out and asking my brother/sister to reimburse me. They're my family! If I wasn't willing to buy them lunch then I just wouldn't take them out. And if we're talking a much bigger purchase than lunch then why the hell would you allow a 7/8 year old to make such a big purchase, without consulting their parent first (whom you expect to pay for it)?!\n\nAnd now, rather than cancelling the trip you're going to let one kid miss out and make it clear to them that they're not a real part of the family. What did Nia do to deserve this?\n\nYour brother and his fiance have weird systems. I get that it's whatever works for them but now it's involving you which is not ok. He should pay for both of the kids and claim the money from Lisa if he cares. The burden shouldn't be on you.\n\nLisa shouldn't go into a system like this and then try and manipulate her way into not paying. If she's not willing or not able to pay then she should have discussed that with you not just try and get out of it.\n\nInfo: if Lisa had given you a small amount of money for Nia but the activities you'd planned cost more than that, what would you have done? Would you have shaped the activities to fit or just let Nia miss out?\n\nI feel bad for Nia most of all.\n\nI'm probably gonna get downvoted for this because Reddit is all about individual entitlement and quite anti-parents, but I stand by it.", "The way I see it Lisa hasn't got the money to keep up with you. That's a difficult situation for her, and totally not your problem. But she decided to make it yours, and that's not OK. So having the kid not come is her decision, and maybe she really can't afford it, so it's okay. She can make it a nice day with her daughter, and you have a nice day with your  kid and your nephew. If your brother wants the time of with her he can pitch in. But there is no reason why you should.", "NTA. and Lisa has fixed the situation for you - no Nia. Just enjoy your time with your daughter and nephew, and if Nia asks why she can't come, tell her ask mummy. \n\nIt is common courtesy to contribute to someone taking your child out for the day - if the situation was reversed you can bet your bottom dollar Lisa would be demanding reimbursement.\n\nDon't cave - why should you subsidise her child when she isn't grateful?", "She wants a babysitter to pay for the kids spending. Wow, unhinged, greedy. Don't take her kid. Not your duty.", "ESH\nYou were buying stuff for her child, expecting to be repaid, without checking her budget\nBut, you were also fronting money to buy her child things\n\nThis \"what can you afford\" discussion really should have happened after outing number 1", "NTA... perfectly done. \n\nYou spoke to her befor problem came up. You did this privately. You were factual not judgmental. You left room for her to decide how she wanted to move forward.  \n\nGreat conflict resolution skills", "NTA. I just feel bad for Nia", "NTA.  The first time paying late could be forgiven, but having to basically nag and chase her down is not okay especially when she tried to justify why she doesn\u2019t owe you.  You were perfectly reasonable in asking for money upfront so you know what Nia\u2019s \u201cbudget\u201d is for outings. It might hurt, but Nia may have to sit out these outings if BOTH Lisa and Ollie refuse to fund it and you don\u2019t want/can\u2019t fund it (no shade here because taking multiple kids out is expensive).  Yes I find your brother to be an AH as well as Lisa because they are a family and both should be treating their stepkids equal to their bio kid.", "NTA\n\nNina stays home from now on.", "NTA but Ollie should pay OP for Nia\u2019s expenses and then he\u2019s the one who can get repayment from his fianc\u00e9.

Lisa needs to be upfront with her own child about finances.", "NTA. Lisa needs to learn to pay for her offspring and stop expecting you to stump up.", "NTA. It\u2019s easy to bypass this if she would just pay. She doesn\u2019t. So this is the consequences.

Well tough. That train has left the station.", "NTA. Lisa essentially wants you to babysit for free AND pay for everything. The least she could do is pay her child\u2019s share which you shouldn\u2019t have to even ask.

And you have no responsibility to be strict about it, if anything Ollie needs to talk with his fianc\u00e9 and teach her about common decency.", "NTA you were trying to find a compromise. Heck since you\u2019re ok spending some of your own money getting money from Lisa upfront helps you to know what to expect and if you want to pitch in a little of your own to help Nia feel equal and included you could without wondering how much you\u2019d be getting back or how much your actually spending on her. Lisa is very rude for trying to make things about bio or non bio relationships.", "OP has two options, she can either stop taking the cousins for expensive outings or she can learn to eat the costs for Lisa\u2019s kid. Lisa has made it clear she doesn\u2019t want to pay for these outings and can\u2019t afford them. Now Lisa sounds like a mooch after two years of chasing her to pay it, it\u2019s obviously a dead end.", "Seriously, brother can do all this cash chasing instead of letting a family/childcare relationship become ruined over it", "And she's *really* angry because she can't afford to treat her child to the same things their siblings get, and hasn't negotiated with her husband a way to help the children feel equal. She's taking her anger out on OP for not having a fully unified family", "On that note, I was raised in a culture that if you're inviting someone to an outing then you are also offering to reasonably cover the costs for that person ie I do cover the costs of my niblings when I take them out because thats my own personal social rules. So I'm covering tickets, gas and meals but I'm not buying video games and toy sets.", "I think the way I wrote it made it sound like I want every penny back, and that\u2019s simply not the case. Most of the time I do just swallow the cost, but mind you that\u2019s because Ollie/his ex do as well. And yes, we have an agreement to buy the kids what they want when we\u2019re out with each other\u2019s because in our minds, we\u2019re being saved a trip to the toy store. I don\u2019t mind if Sienna comes back with dolls after a day out, it\u2019s not like I wouldn\u2019t have bought them at some point anyway. I get that this might not work for everyone, but for us it\u2019s normal and simpler. \n\nMy thing is, Lisa has known this for two years. For two years, she\u2019s seen Ollie take my daughter out and buy her things and me pay him back and vice versa. She never came to me and said \u201cplease don\u2019t let Nia buy anything while you\u2019re at the shopping centre\u201d, nor did she say \u201cthis thing that Nia has come home with is out of my budget, could you please return it\u201d. She takes things, pretends she\u2019s fine with paying them, and then a few days later when I remind her, she starts saying she can\u2019t afford it. That for me is crossing a line. Or, she could tell Nia not to ask for things while out. I\u2019ve said that to my daughter, \u201cwhen you\u2019re out with (friend), I know you might want a toy or xyz but mummy\u2019s not there to pay for it, and friend\u2019s mummy isn\u2019t going to buy it for you, so just remember what it is and we can get it when it\u2019s just you and me\u201d. She has had these options for two years, and she had the option to just try and work with me when I spoke to her, but she has taken none of them. That leads me to believe that because everything is suiting her - not having to pay, or at worst only partially, that she\u2019s fine with that. \n\nIf Lisa said \u201cthis is my budget for the day\u201d, I would try to work around that where possible. That said, if I knew that budget wouldn\u2019t work ie. Wouldn\u2019t cover tickets for an amusement park etc then I would expect her to factor that in. I would always try to work with her but it\u2019s not going to be a matter of me always paying for things that she can\u2019t.", "I agree with you. This is bizarre to me and is definitely not normal to be buying expensive toys for other peoples children and expecting them to pay you back. It\u2019s clear that op and her brother don\u2019t struggle financially to do this for each other but it\u2019s apparent that this isn\u2019t the case for lisa. It seems like this is beyond Op and is an issue for her brother and lisa to sort out between them. Treating each child differently when you are or are planning to become one family is going to cause some problems if one parent can afford things or are willing to buy everything that their biological child wants but the that the other can\u2019t afford it or doesn\u2019t want to.", "Did you ever discuss this with Lisa? Ask her if the agreement with your brother works for her as well?\n\nYou said she's had 2 years to bring it up, but so have you.\n\nIf the issue is with big toy purchases and not with daily outing costs, rather than leaving Nia at home and taking the other two why don't you just do something less expensive or skip the shops?", "Why the hell would you allow a 7 year old to spend so much money without consulting their parent? And from the sounds of it this seems to be a regular thing so you've potentially allowed a 7 year old to spend thousands of euros of their parents money, without consulting them!", "Then Ollie needs to not comment on how you get reimbursed. It seems he understands very well who he is marrying.", "Yeah, I agree.  When OP takes their kids out, spends as she chooses, and then expects reimbursement after the fact, she's basically spending *their* money--and apparently spending more than Lisa wants to.  Seems this should have been a conversation two years ago.", "EXACTLY!", "No, I didn\u2019t. But when nothing changed I just presumed, and when she never commented on it, I carried on. In hindsight perhaps it only continued to work because when Ollie and Lisa take the kids, Ollie is the one paying for Sienna\u2019s stuff, not Lisa. But I still think if you are the new person entering a dynamic it\u2019s up to you to say if it doesn\u2019t work for you. In all the times I\u2019ve taken Nia out she never once thought to pull me aside and say \u201chey please don\u2019t let Nia buy any toys while you\u2019re out today\u201d, that\u2019s all it would have taken. \n\nI\u2019m happy to sometimes change plans, but I\u2019m also not willing to do that all the time. At the end of the day i have to take into account what the kids want to do, it can\u2019t always be scaled down for Lisa. Plus, if I\u2019m asked to watch the kids and they\u2019re just coming along with me on my day to day, I can\u2019t always adjust my own schedule. At the end of the day, I am 100% willing to work with Lisa within reason, that\u2019s what I was trying to do by eliminating the awkwardness, and I feel like she made it clear she doesn\u2019t want to reach a compromise by walking off in a huff.", "Because my brother and his ex have said in advance that they don\u2019t mind. We have *always* all (brother, ex, me, and my husband) been fine with this.", "Lisa has known this for two years. If she was unhappy at any point, she could have said that to me? She could have said it to Ollie, she could even have said to Nia \u201cwhen you go out with (me), don\u2019t pick out toys/accessories etc\u201d, I\u2019ve definitely said that to my daughter before she goes out with a friend\u2019s family.", ">But I still think if you are the new person entering a dynamic it\u2019s up to you to say if it doesn\u2019t work for you.\n\nI disagree, she's entering a dynamic where she's the outsider and outnumbered, it's reasonable to see why she might be reticent about rocking the boat. I do think she should have said something, but I think that's also true of you. You had an agreement with your brother, I think it's reasonable for you to outright ask her if she's ok with the same agreement.\n\n>But when nothing changed I just presumed\n\nBut you said for two years you've always had difficulties getting her to pay. Surely that was a sign that she wasn't ok with the arrangement? In two years why did you never think to ask her about this, when clearly she had some sort of issue with it?\n\n>At the end of the day i have to take into account what the kids want to do, it can\u2019t always be scaled down for Lisa.\n\nAt that age you can always find something for kids to do that doesn't cost hundreds of euros.\n\nI think if you're taking out kids in your family, and you know that parents can't afford it then you should choose something cheaper to do or not do anything at all. It's not fair to exclude Nia and make her feel bad, she's done nothing wrong.", "I'd say NTA because you have a particular standing arrangement with your brother, but just for myself I have to point out that this is the whackiest arrangement I've ever heard of.  If someone offered to take my kid out for the day and they came back with a \u20ac350 gift \"from aunty\" that I was then expected to pay for - along with the expenses of the day out - without knowing about this in advance, I'd be resistant to paying too.  And you'd probably never see my kid again.", ">If she was unhappy at any point, she could have said that to me?\n\nIt sounds like she **has** been doing that. You literally say in your post that she has told you she can't afford things you keep choosing to do and said things like \"I should have taken the kids to fast food place instead of a restaurant.\" You just aren't listening to her and are keeping up similar expenditures, then being peeved that she doesn't want to pay for them when she has literally told you she can't afford things like that.\n\nYou're doing the right thing now by asking her for her budget up front, and that is an obvious solution that she should not be offended by, but she has absolutely talked about the issue before.", "And when she said that, I told her why I didn\u2019t and why I won\u2019t.

When I said, I\u2019m taking the kids to an amusement park, why not just say in advance that you\u2019re not comfortable with that rather than wait until after they\u2019ve come back to say \u201cwell you didn\u2019t have to take them there\u201d?", "Fair points", "I\u2019m confused. If she had given you sufficient money for fast food but not a proper restaurant, does that mean Nia would have to stay home?", "This tells me you all are doing ok financially, just buying kids whatever toys they want when they want them.

If you are expected to buy toys, then she isn\u2019t going to take the kids out either. I think the problem here might be you all spoiling the kids, and trying to make Lisa do the same without knowing her financial situation. It sounds like you and your family are rich and spoiled, and you are passing it down to your kids. \nQUIT BUYING KIDS EXPENSIVE TOYS EVERY TIME YOU GO OUT!", "No, I didn\u2019t explicitly have the same talk, but she is out with Ollie and the kids all the time. She has seen him buy my daughter toys, she\u2019s seen me pay him back, we have ALL referenced this kind of thing multiple times over the two years. You keep trying to make out like this is all blindsiding to her, it is not. If she didn\u2019t want that, she has had 2 years to say so.\n\nI\u2019m not going to reply to you anymore, because you\u2019ve chosen to get personal. How my brother and I raise our children and spend our money is beyond the scope of this post, if you want to give out free parenting advice, do so elsewhere.", "I don\u2019t know exactly how they divide it, but I believe bills and food are evenly split (I don\u2019t know exactly how), and anything beyond that is pay for your own or 50/50. \n\nI understand what you mean about merging money but I think from a coparenting perspective that gets tricky. I don\u2019t think Ollie would like to know that the money he pays in child support was going into a joint account to pay for his ex\u2019s stepkid\u2019s stuff, for example. They just find it works best this way. That\u2019s up to them."]}
