After we graduated, I moved to a different state to be with family after receiving some very devastating medical news, but we still kept in touch and they were there for me as much as they could be, stepping in for support whenever my family couldn't. After I got better, the three of us moved into a house together and D and I got very close, going out on one (very awkward) date that ended in an uncomfortable kiss and from then on we decided we'd be better off as best friends.\n\nThree years and the discovery that I am asexual/aromantic later, D got a new girlfriend, S (28F), and was completely taken with her. A and I suggested inviting her over to meet her and maybe introduce her to some of our friends since she was new to the city and didn't know many people. S was incredibly sweet, if a little shy, but A and I liked her and thought she was a good fit for D. We started inviting her to our nights out, movie nights, etc. and after she began spending the night more and more I started buying extra snacks and drinks that D told me she liked to keep at the house to help make her feel comfortable.\n\nAfter a while D mentioned to us that S was concerned about how close we were and told us several issues she had: things like how much we hugged, how I wear shorts and crop tops around the house, how we share blankets during movie nights, that we text him too much etc. A and I were a little annoyed but they were little issues so we gave him and S more space and I started to wear longer shirts and pants if I knew she was over. \n\nEverything came to a head at the friendsgiving dinner I hosted. It's a big deal to me and I send out invites a month in advance to make sure I can make enough food and know everyone's dietary restrictions as I cook everything from scratch. After telling me S couldn't make it, D showed up with her when everyone was getting ready to eat. I welcomed her in but told her I wasn't expecting her and didn't know if I had anything for her to eat but offered to either give her my plate, make something for her, or go out and get her something if nothing sounded good. \n\nS went off. She accused me of all sorts of things that basically added up to the idea I was trying to steal D from her. I bluntly told her I wasn't interested in him and she knocked the plates of food off the table yelling that she knew D and I had dated and I still wanted him, that I was faking my sexuality to play hard to get and that I was two-faced for trying to still be her friend.\n\nI could've handled the yelling but after she wasted the food I had spent all day cooking, I told her she was delusional and to get the hell out and D took her home. He hasn't spoken to A or I since, outside of saying that he and S were fighting and I didn't have to call her crazy. I don't think I was wrong to kick her out but I do feel guilty and wonder if I could've handled things differently.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670045163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb8m5q/aita_for_kicking_my_roommates_girlfriend_out_of/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Could you have handled things more eloquently?  Sure.  Would I have?  No.  The girl sounds batshit crazy and you did the right thing.  However, I am sure you are aware of this but your relationship with D obviously may be in jeopardy.  If those two stay together, it's hard to imagine how you can stay friends with him.", "NTA 100%. WTF kind of behaviour is that?! I think you just acted out of strong emotions in the moment, but her behaviour is inexcusable. Those thoughts and insecurities are obviously running rent-free in her head, and she's taking them out on you.", "NTA but you and A may need to start thinking about doing more than giving D space. It sounds like the friendship has run its course and if he wants to throw years long friendship away for someone that\u2019s more than comfortable destroying food and dishes in someone else\u2019s home? Let.  Him. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing you or A can do or say to him, he\u2019s already defending her despite what she did in your home. And I wouldn\u2019t put it past either of them to convince themselves you\u2019re going out of your way to sabotage their relationship, and that you\u2019re still in love with him. Because again, he defended her when she trashed your hard work and wasted both food and money.. Yet the costs of food is skyrocketing and she disposed of meals for more than one person.", "NTA if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. His girlfriend was acting crazy and you pointed that out.", "NTA and you absolutely did the correct thing by asking her to leave. Her attack was inappropiate. She threw the food?! You were protecting other guests at that point. \n\nIf she has an issue with you and D, then her issue is with D, not you. She can state her boundaries (i need to feel secure, etc) with him and decide to leave if her needs arent met. What she cannot do is control YOU, and thats currently what she is doing with the comments about what you wear and how often you text. \n\nSadly, D is in a controlling relationship and needs to figure this out on his own. If you push him to end it, youre also controlling him. Give him space. Getting out of a controlling relationship is a mindfuck and it will be very hard for him, but if he makes it to the other side you might get your friend back.", "NTA. Speaking as a sometimes crazy person myself, that ish is crazy. The insecurity after you did everything to make her feel welcome is bananacakes. Yeesh.", "NTA. Bad behavior is never okay and I'm surprised at her audacity to ruin your meal. D should assess his relationship because 'crazy' doesn't just go away like a bad cold. \n\nSide note. While I have no experience in the matter, being asexual sounds like it can be challenging so more power to you.", "NTA at all. It sounds like you went out of your way to welcome her into your home and your friend circle. I can\u2019t begin to understand how she twisted that the way she did but it is not your fault or your problem and if D is angry at you, it is misplaced.", "NTA S is", "Nta she does sound crazy", "NTA. S made a scene for no reason.", "NTA at all. It sounds like you went out of your way to welcome her into your home and your friend circle.
