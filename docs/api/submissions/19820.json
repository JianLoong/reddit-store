It doesn't sound like the two of them ever had a relationship and the past 13 years must have been so hard on you're daughter because she was abandoned by her own mom. And if she truly loved her daughter deep down, as you claim, she never would've abandoned her and definitely would've made effort to keep in touch. But she didn't, how do you expect your daughter to say goodbye to her, they're essentially strangers.", "YTA\n\nYou were trying to impose emotions you had for your daughter's mom onto your daughter, but those never existed as you imagined them. Even if she had known her mom as many other kids do, it was still her choice to attend or not attend.\n\nSource: My bio-mom left us for someone else when I was three, and Dad got custody. We were forced to visit occasionally but no mother-daughter bond was aver built. I will not mourn her passing.", "YTA for thinking the \u201clove of your life\u201d is someone who didn\u2019t love you and abandoned her daughter.

Or did she essentially not see her for her ENTIRE life?\n\nI'm leaning YTA for forcing this on anyone because people grieve in their own ways. Projecting your own complicated relationship that you had with your ex onto another person who had an obviously very, very different - and maybe even non-existent - relationship was selfish. I can give you the benefit of the doubt that you were simply misguided and thought that was a good way to help your daughter process this but this was indeed misguided and probably did more harm than good.", "YTA\n\nI would bet that your daughter likely has already mourned not having a mother. Bringing her to a funeral of a woman she never knew feels like opening wounds that were probably long shut.", "YTA. You are very mistaken if you think your ex-wife deep down loved the child she abandoned.", "YTA, I knew she was acting up because she didn't know her mom but this was her last chance to say goodbye and I didn't want her to regret it in the future.  \n\n\nGoodbye to what? to a mother who didn't care about her? to a mother who abandoned her? you got mad because she didn't know her. yeah how come. ever wondered why that is?", "YTA \n\nShe\u2019s old enough to decide not to go", "She\u2019s  young and you want what\u2019s best for her like any good parent.

Despite what you think abandonment is NOT love. Your ex was selfish, and apparently so are you. Your daughter has a right to whatever feelings she has toward the person that ABANDONED her. You forcing her only showed her that your love for your ex is far far greater than your love for your daughter.  You need to apologize and actually start LISTENING to what your daughter says.\n\nAs a side note, I hated my mother (much like your daughter HATES her mother) and I didn't go to her funeral, and not once have I ever regretted it.", "YTA.  Massively.  You dragged your child to the funeral of the woman who abandoned her, and you can't figure out why she's angry at you?  Apologize to her, and get the two of you into therapy.", "YTA.  There is a saying that \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions\".  In this case, you created a storm with your daughter.  As others have said, your daughter is absolutely correct.  You better get some help to get get passed your ex-wife.  You did this for yourself and did nothing but damage your relationship with your daughter.  Better start the repairing process with your daughter real soon.", "INFO: How do you know your ex-wife loved your daughter?", "YTA. I'm sorry for your loss but you can't expect her to want to go to the funeral of a \"mother\" who had no interest in her. I'm sure your daughter has some resentment there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I know her mom loved her deep down but didn't get the chance to tell her\n\n12 years leaves room for a lot of chances.", "YTA. I get that you're mourning but you're also lying to your daughter and yourself. It's not that your daughter \"didn't know anything about her other than what people said\". Your daughter knows your wife abandoned you and her over a decade ago. She know that he mother never communicated with her or spent time with her (based on you saying that she \"didn't know her mom\"). She know that those were choices your wife made.\n\nIt's not that \"her mom loved her deep down but didn't get the chance to tell her\". You want to believe that because you want to believe the best in your ex but the truth is she never said that or left a message to that affect. What she did do is abandon her child and never bothered to see or communicate with her from the time she was an infant. These don't sound like the acts of someone who loved her daughter deeply.", "YTA. And a couple other things as well. \n\n\u201cHer last chance to say goodbye.\u201d???\nYou can say goodbye anytime you want. The person is dead and only the physical body is there.

YTA, your daughter is right, you did this for you, not for her.", "YTA someone that loves a child \"deep down\" does not discard them like yesterday's trash, even your daughter knows that. I'm sure she has enough issues with that so dragging her to the funeral of the mother that completely abandoned and rejected her so she could \"say goodbye\"?? I think you really damaged your kid with this one.", "Yta\u2026you dragged your daughter to a place because you loved the person the place was for\u2026.\n\nWth does that have to do with your daughter at all\n\nI wouldnt blame your daughter for not forgiving you for 10 years", "Soft but stern YTA. You are and have obviously held a torch for a woman that your daughter has had zero relationship with. You can\u2019t expect her to mourn someone she never knew. You shouldn\u2019t have forced her to go. I think some grief therapy is in order for you to finally heal from what was a toxic relationship and attachment to her mom.", "YTA. Your daughter obviously deals with a death like that differently than you. Don't screw with people that may be grieving and want to handle things differently than you do.\n\nBest case is that your daughter didn't even know her, and wanted nothing to do with her. And you behaved exactly as she described, which is reason enough for her to be pissed off at you.", "Soft YTA. You were grieving and you wanted to do right by your former wife. I get that you\u2019re afraid your daughter would regret not going in the future but forcing her to attend the funeral of someone who abandoned her will probably deepen her pain and make it harder for her to find peace with the past. You should\u2019ve let her grieve in her own way, or not at all. Your wife had plenty of time to tell your daughter she loved her and she didn\u2019t. Of course your daughter is going to be angry and upset right now. Let her work through it in her own way at her own pace.", "YTA \n\nPurely speculation, but it sounds like you wanted her to be just as attached to this moment as you were. She didn\u2019t have an attachment to this woman and she\u2019s probably old enough to have put the pieces together that y\u2019all were ditched. She might resent what happened. Either way, she is old enough to understand what happened and she\u2019s old enough to decide she doesn\u2019t want to go. It may be time to seek some counseling for the grief but also the abandonment.   \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "I know you meant well but YTA on this one. She didn't know her egg donor, so why should she pay any respect?", "yta.dude, you seem a little bit delisuinal, the person you loved only existed in your head, 13 years and she never meet her? come on...she did not love your daugther, you shuould care more about her and not this fantasy image you have created in your mind.", "YTA- that wasn't her mother, that was her egg donor. You need therapy because you are clinging to a memory of a woman who never really existed and what's worse is your shoving this false woman on your daughter.", "YTA. You meant well but no, you don't actually know that her mom really loved her. She had 13 years to grow up if that was the problem and it turned out that it wasn't the problem. Get therapy for both of you. Your daughter is seeing things with more clarity than you are and that's not ok. It must have been excruciating to sit in a room full of people she's never met, feeling like everyone knew she was the rejected child.", "YTA - your daughter has no reason to have regret of not saying goodbye to a person she did not know. In your daughters eyes her mother did not love her - even deep down- because her mother abandoned her and then was still around town and never that has got to suck for a kid.  \n\nIt was fine for you to go but the daughter should not have been subjected to that. Imagine all these people that knew  the mom and could talk about a woman that never gave her (daughter) the time of day. Honestly look at that through her eyes -all you did was show her and reinforce her mom did not want her because other people there knew the mom because the mom was in contact with them.", "YTA. I understand where you were coming from but it seems like YOU wanted to go to the funeral and used her saying goodbye as your reason for being there.   \n\n\nI was 13 when my dad passed and I still resent my mom to this day for making me go look at his body.  I was at at the funeral of course, but I had no desire to see him that way but she made me and that is now the last image in my head of my dad.", "YTA\n\nShe can't say goodbye to someone who never said hello.", "It is impossible to make any form of judgment. Your situation is far above what any self-appointed reddit psychologist can \"analyze\" and \"judge\".\n\nThe only thing I can offer is my condolences to you and your daughter.", "So not only did she have to deal with the abandonment of her mother and maybe hoped she would come back, but was also forced to goto her funeral and again deal with the abandonment knowing she won't ever come back. Why put her through that trauma? Now the last memory she has of her mother is  a casket. \n\nYTA. You are selfish and did that just so you wouldn't feel guilty that her mother is a jerk.", "\"I didn't want her to regret \\[not attending the funeral\\] in the future\" is one of the most hypocritical statements I've ever heard.\n\nShe didn't want to go but YOU MADE HER FOR YOUR OWN SELFISH REASONS. It has nothing to do with her regretting anything, except being under your dictatorial control.\n\nShe will have to get along with you while she's under your roof, but she might well carry her anger at you over this forever.", "YTA.\n\n> I know her mom loved her deep down but didn't get the chance to tell her.\n\nShe had 13 years to tell her. And every day, she chose not to.\n\nPlease, please try to set your feelings aside and step into your daughter's shoes. This woman *abandoned* her. Completely. Left and never came back. And you clearly still loved the woman. Imagine your dad making excuses for the person that abandoned you, probably still mentioning her from time to time, and then *dragging you to see her funeral*. Let the girl move on from the woman that moved on from her 13 years ago.\n\nAnd if you love your daughter at all, then you need to really reconsider your misplaced feelings for someone that didn't love her, and hurt her in a more significant way than probably anyone else ever will in her life. Honestly, consider seeking counseling to resolve these misplaced feelings. For your daughter's sake if not your own.", "Do you want to hear the truth?", "YTA. Your ex DID have a chance to tell your daughter how much she loved her. But she didn\u2019t. She left and never came back. Stop thinking your daughter is dumb. Parents who love you don\u2019t abandon you. And she\u2019s right about why you did what you did. That was not for her. You ignored her feelings. It was for YOU. Those are the only feelings you shared here without trying to dismiss them. You care about YOUR feelings. Apologize to your daughter.", "NTA you didn't want her to have regrets. I understand, I have regrets about not going to a funeral that i wish my parents had made me go to. People who died in the hospital that i didn't visit because i was busy and was told they would be ok.

Lmao this sub is so dramatic, OP will apologize and this will be forgotten about next week", "The difference here is that you wanted to go. She didn\u2019t. \n\nThis is essentially the equivalent of what was done to you. Your family refused to allow you to attend and OP refused to allow his daughter not to.

Her mom _abandoned her_. If my own parent abandoned me and then someone tried to get me to go to the funeral I\u2019d laugh them out of the room.

She didn\u2019t know her mother but to many people even an unknown biological parent is an important symbol of who they are - think about how many adopted children want to seek out their bio family and learn where they came from. Many people feel knowing is better than not knowing and wondering, even if the knowing turns out negative.\n\nThere is no one size fits all and OP was trying to weigh up both actions and make an adult decision for his child. For what it\u2019s worth, I probably would have made the same decision in his shoes - I think you regret more things you don\u2019t do than the things you do, and at least his child will never look back and say, \u2018I wish I had gone.\u2019 It\u2019s weighing up the trauma of regret versus the trauma of going to a stranger\u2019s funeral, and OP went for the latter - which I think I would also view as the lesser trauma overall.\n\nI think OP was doing the best he could and genuinely would be at fault EITHER WAY, so we really can\u2019t judge something like this.", "But you had a relationship with him.

Why doesn't daughter get to make any kind of choice in this?  I know you're grieving OP, but you are so much YTA.

You just go for the sake of going, and because she's 13, her father has to make this decision for her.\n\nRegardless of your specific relationship with her, her funeral is one of those important life events that you do so has not to have missed out and left things open.

If its an adult the \u201csuck it up\u201d routine works but you\u2019re telling a 13 year old to suck it up and pay respects to a person who caused you pain just because they\u2019re dead.

It's a lesson that her father seems to want to make sure that she learns.", "No one is expecting her to \"pay respects\" in any meaningful or effortful sense. It's only expected for her to go so that she can say she went. By the age of 13, a person is more than mature enough to go to a building and sit quietly for a couple hours perhaps make some small talk with strangers or family, and then leave.\n\nHer father would have been negligent to not have her go. Never having gone to her mother's funeral could have left her with future regrets. Simply going and making an appearance is the better option. It's a perfunctory social obligation at worst and an avoidance of future hanging doubts at best.", "Counterpoint: she\u2019s 13, never met the woman, only knows horrible things about her and how she was abandoned and going to a funeral to hear people mourn and cry could have major negative effects on her. That coupled with the fact that the father clearly only wanted her to go to act like the 3 of them were actually some happy loving unit pointed out by the fact that the daughter can read OP like a book tells me she wasn\u2019t just meant to go and sit quietly.

What gets me is he admits that in 13 years he only saw his ex twice totally by coincidence both times and wasn't pre-planned. Then the next paragraph he says \" I know her mom loved her deep down but didn't get the chance to tell her.\". He knows the truth but he doesn't want to admit it. The daughter is 100% right that the only reason he went was because he was still strung up on his ex because why else would he make excuses for her when she obviously didn't give a shit about him or the daughter.", "I honestly think there\u2019s no way this can actually be real. I hope not. Like, if OP wants to forgive his ex for abandoning him, ok. If he still loves her, I don\u2019t get it, and she clearly did NOT feel the same way, but alright, whatever. But I can not fathom ever forgiving someone for abandoning my kid."]}
