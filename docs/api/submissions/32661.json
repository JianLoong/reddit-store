Nothing changed in the two weeks you waited to tell them no, you were just avoiding conflict and hoping the issue would magically disappear.

If you have not cancelled yet, its your time to set boundaries. It does not sound like there has been a trial run on anything so you have no idea on expectations.\n\nYTA for cancelling but nTA for setting explicit hard and fast boudnaries.\n\nSo, show up. Text them tonight and tell them because no one clarified anything in advance or set expectations for timing you have booked another engagement for 9am. You must leave by 8:45 so please prioritize what needs to occur. \n\nWhen you walk in, wear a decent casual dress and again, state the above. Because this is so last minute, I'm able to give you an hour and a half of my time, then I MUST leave. At 8:30 immediately start packing up and leave. If anyone protests, tell them that they could have called or gave you any information prior to the event but they chose not to and you must leave.\n\nSet your boundary, keep a firm backbone. EVERYONE will try to push you on it. To the loudest most obnoxious person, tell them that had it been imortant to them they could have made arranagements more then 2 weeks in advance or treated you like an actual human, but alas, they didn't, so here we are.", "You picked a pretty crummy time to decide to show a spine.

What does staying up late in a few days time have to do with anything? I'm so confused", "Yeah that\u2019s so petty and shitty. They don\u2019t owe you anything, but when you said yes you made a commitment so you DO owe them something.

Nothing has changed on their end since you promised you'd show up and do their hair.  All that has happened is you've sat around and gotten angry and now want to punish them for somehow disrespecting you.  (I guess you expected to be invited to the wedding in exchange for helping out?)  You should have said, \"No\" long before this.\n\nIf they'd posted/texted awful things about you or laughed about you in the meantime, that would be one thing.  Instead, you're going, \"Well, you never invited me to the wedding (not that I ever told you I wanted to go) so f' you.

But either way you made a commitment if you had backed out with a few days notice fine it happens but to do it the night before is just petty and vindictive because the B&G didn't invite you.

The bride could have invited you to the wedding right from the start and asked if you would be amenable to doing hair and makeup for the bridesmaids as a wedding gift. \n\nYTA for agreeing to do it because you wanted to become friends, even though you felt disrespected, and then backing out at the last minute.", "Do you think being an asshole is funny or cute? It isn't.", "Making excuses since the consensus is YTA.", "This is because OP cancelled to be spiteful. She said yes hoping it would lead to an invite. When she realized it wasn't she cancelled.\nAny guidance that takes away the spite. Will be met with excuses."]}
