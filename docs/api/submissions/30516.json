She told me it\u2019s because he\u2019s autistic and needs to be happy. And I said \u201cright.

I don't have any plans to have my own children, but if you were near me, I would be your auntie, and we would have as much celebration as my meager paycheck allows. \n\nDon't forget: just because you will soon grow up, it doesn't mean that you won't get to have joy in life. When you're old enough to be on your own, you can surround yourself with people who would love to celebrate you. And you can buy all the toys you never got, you can even play with them.

Yeah, yeah I do.  Are cults harmful to kids?  Yes, they fucking are.  Sorry, I grew up in a high-control religion too and it was unpleasant. \n\nI don't think your mom's a hypocrite for bringing you to someone else's party.

You want to feel special on your birthday.  You feel like you've missed out on things because of religion.

Their family doesn't participate in those things.  If they get invited to a birthday celebration, should they say \"No thanks, I believe that birthdays are sinful?\".   Not necessarily.  I feel that this should be up to personal conviction.\n\nFor instance, my dad believes drinking alcohol is a sin.  No one in my family drinks except me and my sister.  My dad has stated that he will not attend our weddings if there is alcohol at the reception.  This makes me a bit sad, but I respect his beliefs.  However, if he wanted to come along and bring a bottle of wine for the other guests at the reception, I would not say he was a hypocrite.   He should follow his religious beliefs in a way that feels ethical to him.  \n\nI wish my dad could understand that he can keep his own personal standards while still accepting the standards of people with different beliefs.    He can't.", "My condolences", "Just think about all the birthdays and holidays you and your brother can celebrate when you are both adults.
