Work hard to get an education, scholarships for post-secondary or a trade school, work experience, anything you can.

Build your circle. Create an exit plan. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, DON\u2019T LET THE BAPTIZE YOU. You can\u2019t be disfellowed if you aren\u2019t a full church member. This is vital if you want to keep contact with your brother and help him get out after you do. My former JW told his family he didn\u2019t feel mature enough to make the decision yet and that got them to leave him alone. Because he never joined the church, his family can\u2019t be punished for speaking to him as he is only a worldly person, not disfellowed. If you want to keep contact with your brother or any other family that is still in, this is your best shot. \n\nI hope that advice helps.

Your brother can back up your story. If she\u2019s going to use religion to treat her children like this, you are allowed to return the favor.", "NTA. You poor kids, I hope you can get away from this twisted cult in the future. You both deserve to be celebrated and loved.", "I noticed you responded to a comment asking if you are JW, you might want to take a trip to r/raisedbynarcissest", "I just want you to know you absolutely deserve to be happy.", "NTA - I am so sorry for what you are going through. I grew up in a similar cult - not JW but most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Please know that the way you are growing up is not only not normal, but also not ok. That doesn't mean your mom and the other adults are evil. Maybe they are, but most likely they just have their own unresolved issues in life that they are not handling. That still leaves you and your brother being raised badly and in a form of harm that our society will not do anything about.\n\nPlease make a plan to leave and get some sort of therapy with a provider who knows the term \"spiritual abuse\" when you can. That may be at 18. It may take you longer. That's ok. Please do look for any support or help you can get now as a minor. Your options are more limited, but there may be some resources available in your area. Please know that growing up like this leaves inner marks and you not only need some help with what has been done to you, it's ok to need that help. You get to decide what your life looks like, not your mom and not the elders. You have so much more to offer than what they have outlined for you. \n\nI would note that I still find birthdays and many usual holidays weird and I've been out for over 20 years now.

I worked as an assistant in and Elementary School and one kid who was a JW was not allowed to participate in parties, like Halloween or any other parties, like Birthday parties.  The child's parents were very clear on this.  So this poor little boy just sat at his desk, while everyone else got a cupcake or a chocolate pumpkin and got nothing.  It really seemed cruel.  But I cannot imagine a parent who really believed that was a sin or whatever would give another person a cake and participate in the celebration IF IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SIN or whatever.  In theory it should be a sin or whatever to take you to the party.  It sounds like she is taking a religious belief and being mentally abusive in the name of said religion.

Best advice: get a job as soon as you're able, save all the money you make in a place your mom can't access, and move out as soon as it's legal.

You do need the right therapist. I've had 2 and been really lucky. Both are trauma trained, which I think makes a difference. Not just trauma informed, but actually trauma trained. My current therapist has plenty of previous experience with both cult members and autism too. She is brilliant for me. \n\nI would recommend seeing what you can get out of the Secular Therapy Project, [https://www.seculartherapy.org/](https://www.seculartherapy.org/) if you're not sure where to start. That's not to say you shouldn't be religious. It's just that these therapists take a different approach to religion. Dr. Steven Hassen is not perfect, but has a lot of work around cults. He has some good information online. A therapist who understands cults or 'spiritual abuse' will have a specific set of skills other therapists won't have. The other term you should keep in mind is trauma. Apocalyptic doomsday cults are traumatic to grow up in, apart from whatever else you may personally have going on. \n\nIt can be hard to find the right therapist - and to come up with money for the bill - but it's worth putting some time in to figure out what helps you. Some therapists have responsible podcasts or YouTube offerings that you can explore for free. I think it's worth putting some time into exploring what might help you in these areas. That can help you figure out what to look for in a therapist.\n\nDo be careful mentioning this around your mom. Psychological help was seen as semi to full on satanic in our cult. JW party line is not welcoming of such help either.", "I'm assuming here, and OP correct me if I'm wrong, but neither OP or her brother were allowed to go to their friends birthday parties ever. Which does make their mom a hypocrite.", "Showing respect and deference for a cult is dangerous.", "Thank you, that\u2019s really sweet of you! I doubt that\u2019s something I\u2019d remember though lol \ud83d\ude06", "I\u2019m actually majoring in psychology and my mom after a while finally gave in", "That said, it's probably prudent to keep your head down until you (and possibly your brother) aren't subject to punishment for it, in whatever way you're able to get out."]}
