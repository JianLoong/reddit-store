It's an escalation of the relationship after several months at the introductory stage.\n\nAlso, you missed the point of my post-Mom doesn't have a trump card she can pull out whenever she wants to nix dad's authority. What she did was very poor co-parenting that threatens to escalate hostilities and/or crash the status quo.  If dad's idea was really that bad, and if he was dead set on it anyway, then mom needs to know how to handle that appropriately--which is to go to an authority that has the authority to overrule dad (or mom) because she does not have that authority.  If the ASD is truly a concern for what was being proposed--then go to the child's ASD care provider and get him/her to go on the record. If the person MOST qualified to make that call wont do it, then mom has no grounds to try and do it either. If Dad doesn't wasn't to listen to the ASD care provider then go to the judge and show the judge Dad's decision making process and suggest a whole rethinking of the decision making responsibilities. But Mom does not get to dispense with those requirements and say\" I know\" and therefore make the decision as if Dad can't or doesn't know and as if she has some authority that is greater than Dad's.\n\nIf the issue is so clear, she won't be able to move without tripping over support for her position, but she has none, other than her own \"better\" judgment and certainty that she can, in fact, make this call.", "She already lives with him.
