Just showing up to Thanksgiving isn't a great idea, though. She should tell her family who she's seeing. Let them get used to the idea (without you there). \n\nEventually, though, you need to get over your desire to avoid your ex and her family.

You are asking to be put in an awkward situation.", "NAH. \n\nShe likes you and wants to share that fact. Maybe it's her also messing with her sister, who knows...

If this isn't serious, there is no point to upsetting everyone over the holidays. Because it might cause an upset. \n\nYour girlfriend is a bit of an AH for inviting drama over the holidays by bringing it up now, when aa later time could be smoother and more appropriate.\n\nThink about how you want this relationship to go because if it gets serious, you will be getting serious about family gatherings, as well. There will be no escaping the potential drama and awkwardness.", "NTA, but have a straightforward conversation with this girl and treat her like your equal.

Not telling the family is super weird and WILL make any meeting more awkward when it didn't need to be. If you're pleasant with everyone, I see no reason for them to be anything but nice to you. The sister needs a heads up though. Cripes, don't show up unannounced. You're right. THAT would be a disaster that doesn't need to happen. \n\nSounds like you're not very interested in the girl if you're not willing to hang out during Thanksgiving weekend. Is there something weird there? Does the sister you're dating give any indication that she wants to lord it over her sister that she's dating her ex? \n\nAs for the ex, she's just another person to you now. Don't make it weird. Go and be normal. She doesn't see you as an ex with feelings attached. You're just someone she dated in high school.", "> I think it could be super tense.\n\nIf you and the sister parted on good terms, it will be as tense as you make it.

She wants to surprise her family with the fact that she is dating her sister's high school sweetheart with no warning. In front of her sister's husband. She is either looking for drama or is the most sheltered and naive girl to ever go to college. \n\nMy assumption is that she is using you as a prop in some weird competition with her older sister. Maybe it's subconscious and she doesn't know she is doing it. One can hope anyways.", "If you are not dating as boyfriend and girlfriend there is no reason for you to go over to her house. If this isnt a super serious relationship, she shouldn't be getting so emotional and shut down over it. But if she is shutting down that means that she wants something more out of you and your relationship. Do you want to date her?  If yes then ask her out, make sure she tells her sister, and then go to the house. But if you aren't dating yet don't put that stress on yourself.\n\n I am not suggesting you dismiss her feelings but get down to the bottom of why she is feeling this way. And she needs to be the one that talks to her big sister. If you want to remove the stress and BS Just talk to big Sis and clear the air. Good luck sounds annoying!\n\nPeople are always s******* on young people, f*** that!

You can't avoid her family indefinitely if it's serious. If it's not, then it seems like she might think it is if she's inviting you to meet spend time with her family. \n\nIf your partner is saying it won't be a big deal, then trust her. Fairly likely she knows how her sister will react a little better than you. \n\nRealistically, what's the worst that could happen? Your gf is already showing her displeasure with how you're acting.
