My older sister also in Uni does not get her own salary and so my parents still pay for her, however they don\u2019t give her enough money to last her even a week. Therefore, I constantly am paying for my sister whenever we\u2019re out and I don\u2019t get to spend or save my money anymore. Since my parents don\u2019t pay for me anymore, they\u2019re supposed to have more money to spend on my older sister anyways but they always claim they don\u2019t have enough money for her. I still do have enough money to spend on the both of us but I need to save up for a car because I want to be able to depend on myself and now that\u2019s not even possible. Whenever I complain to my parents about my money running out by the end of the month, they say that she\u2019s my sister and I should pay for her as well out of my own kindness. Idk if I\u2019m being an asshole by wanting my own money to be able to spend on myself as even when my parents used to pay for me I was barely given anything and my sister was even more spoiled than I was.\n\nUpdate: thank you everyone for your comments I\u2019ve always felt guilty since whenever I bring it up they would make me feel like I was in the wrong.
