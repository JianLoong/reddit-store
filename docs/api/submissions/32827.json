Your sister is their child, not yours. You barely have enough money to get by and your parents are not helping you.\n\nDon't complain to your parents anymore though, just tell them that you can't afford to pay for your sister so they can either send her more money or she can get a job. \n\nAlso, let your sister know that you can't afford to pay for her so you will not be paying starting now. Maybe hang out with her doing free things (if you want to) but don't do things with her that will cost money.", "Nope Not the butthole.

My guess is your sister won't go out if you aren't taking her out. If she does, that's her choice, but you don't have to encourage that behavior by paying for it. Stay home, stop paying for her, and you should be able to save enough in no time. More importantly, if you stay home, you probably will have enough money to not only save up for a car, but you could also offer to have your sister eat with you at home.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is not your responsibility.
