Him and I met 3 years ago, and got engaged within a year, getting married in 6 months. They have 2 kids, who are 17 and 15. The ex wife has been married for 4 years. \nThe kids and I have a super relationship! \n\nAnyways, fast forward to me meeting her the first time, she was super unfriendly and I spent the rest of the evening just talking to the kids. I was so confused because my fianc\u00e9 is super nice to her husband and her husband was very nice to me as well. I just brushed it off and told my fianc\u00e9 she might not like me too much. \n\nNow, last Christmas, the plan was to celebrate Christmas as a whole family but she said she didn\u2019t want me there. My fianc\u00e9 was super confused because the kids adored me (esp the 15 year old one) and didn\u2019t understand the reason. She said that she felt that I didn\u2019t want the kids to spend Christmas with their dad cause if I did I would just accept that I wasn\u2019t invited and my fianc\u00e9 would go alone. This was super hurtful because I have been nothing short of loving to her kids, tutoring them even when it was her week cause I have a PhD in a science field and both the parents (incl my fianc\u00e9) only finished high school so struggle with math and science. We ended up celebrating our own Christmas with the kids a few days earlier. \n\nNow since then she has also asked as several favors like taking the kids when it\u2019s her week cause she had a vacation she didn\u2019t expect etc. But now, she asked us to take the kids during a week that I have a major work deadline, so we said we couldn\u2019t. But then she asked if my fianc\u00e9 can arrange other things like ask his parents for her. I told him this is where I draw the line. I said she should find her own solutions and it\u2019s not up to us. I know I\u2019m being petty and his parents would probably agree but I don\u2019t want to go the extra mile for her cause she hasn\u2019t been kind nor has shown me any respect. AITA?\n\nUpdate: She said she will ask his parents herself instead of him asking. The consensus is im not the problem here, and despite the best effort from my fianc\u00e9, he still needs to set down some boundaries AND we don\u2019t accommodate her anymore. If it turns out she\u2019s racist, there is no need for any more conversation with her.

She's never going to like you and you're never going to have an interaction with her that is not odd. But her behavior has changed to one where she is no longer trying to pull her children away from you.\n\nTwo, I think her request to your husband is so minor, that being that it is not directed toward you, you do not have a say in it, and that intervening is petty.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nNo further explanation needed", "NTA\n\nThis is a problem of her own making. It isn\u2019t an emergency. She\u2019s acting extremely entitled.", "For example, they had bought a last minute deal to NYC, and they got the deal. We had less than 2 weeks notice, and we still accommodated. For Christmas, her husband was of course invited since it was at their house. What puzzles me more is that my fianc\u00e9 has had one other serious girlfriend before me, and she was invited to Christmas. The only difference is that the kids didn\u2019t like the other old girlfriend and idk if it matters, but I am the first and only black gf he has dated.", "Yeah, of course, he can BUT this is again getting her way. She can ask her sisters or parents but she prefers that my fianc\u00e9 asks his parents because the kids like them better. This is where my dilemma is. If it is for the kids, yea, the grandparents are a better choice BUT, just this once, I prefer not to fix her problem until she shows me some respect.", "They are going on vacation together. This is also one of the reasons. They book tickets knowing that it\u2019s their week (even after we say we can\u2019t), and then they ask if we can! Super bizarre! In this case especially, she called and asked that they got a deal and have only ONE day to decide whether to buy it or not. They wanted us to decide if we can do it that week. We said we couldn\u2019t, but they still went ahead and booked. Now, 3 months later, they are back and said wait so you can\u2019t do this week? Can you ask your (my fianc\u00e9) parents?", "True! But the older one has special needs and isn\u2019t as self sufficient as a \u2018normal\u2019 17 year old including only eating home cooked meal, so it means that I will have to do more cooking than what I had planned during that week. He also doesn\u2019t go to school, so there is that.", "I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that absolutely matters. Up until that point I thought maybe she didn't like you because you were younger, or smarter, or prettier, or something simple, but black? It's Occam's Razor. When you have competing theories, the simplest is usually the right one. She's probably racist. Probably that sort of casual racist which would explain why you don't think it's that important, but it would be my guess.", "Unfortunately, it is possible that it is the case. You and fianc\u00e9 need to have a serious conversation with his ex about her behavior.", "Why are you part of that conversation?", "Why are you the one doing that?", "Yeah, I haven\u2019t thought about it until now. This makes a bit of sense given that she commented why I don\u2019t speak the language of their country the one and only time we met. I\u2019m trilingual btw but haven\u2019t yet put effort in speaking this specific language. Oh well, this is something to digest! Wouldn\u2019t have thought abt it if you hadn\u2019t said more on it, so thanks!", "Or it could be because the kids like you so much. Either she\u2019s racist or insecure and jealous that her kids might like you more. Other gf was safe because the kids clearly disliked her. Or C, all of the above. She could be an insecure, jealous and racist\u2026.", "I'm going with option C.", "Sounds like she's jealous and your stepping on her toes because her kids like you. The horror! She's lucky the kids get along with you so well and you could have these great interactions, but she's letting her own crap get in the way. NTA. Plus, the ages don't really constitute this as an emergency situation.", "Nta, she wants to play games here's the prize.  \n\nThe fact your fiance went along with the Xmas thing blows my mind", "NTA but my advice would be to not focus on her else it may cause problems for you. Lay down the boundaries with your husband and then move on. Boundaries like only attend things where you\u2019ve both been invited. 1 accommodation a quarter.

Why do they need a lot of supervision? At that age they feed themselves, get to school on their own and 17 should even be able to be home alone for a week.", "NTA but. . . if it's possible this opens up a door to her treating you better wouldn't the end result be nicer for everyone all round? I mean of course she can hire a sitter or send the kids to stay with friends it is ultimately HER problem, but if the kids like you and you like the kids you might consider doing it But Not Without A Convo first where you say something like \"It seems like we got off of on the wrong foot. I would like it if we could have a more civil relationship. I really like your kids and they seem to like me. Going forward could we (Fill in Black here) and have less of (fill in blank here)?

You are literally a part of the family and even if some people may say not yet you will be officially in 6 months! Why is she mad/jealous/spiteful?? She has a new man, kids to care for, sperate lives now. \n\nJust because she is spiteful and disrespectful doesnt mean you need to shut yourself out of the family.", "It sounds like you got it figured out.\nYes to healthy boundaries, and pro tip: even if there's no racism involved, she's very likely flat out jealous.\n\nYou are ten years younger than her, smart as hell, and her kids adore you.... Whatever piece of her has been secretly okay with her ex because she did fine and he seemed like he didn't can't maintain that anymore. She's insecure.\nAnd likely has no conscious idea of it.", "NTA\n\nIf she's antisocial or introverted,  it won't matter who you are. She probably just doesn't like ANYBODY.\n\nBeing a mom,  her best interests are with the kids though.  If she saw you were ready and willing to be supportive of the kids,  she probably thought you might look past her and see the kids needs. \n\nCuz,  truly,  all adults aside,  the kids have needs. \nThey just aren't really your priority or your responsibility.\n\nYour help should be a bonus not an expectation.", "NTA\n\nNot sure I buy the racist argument out of the gate. I smell jealousy though (kids like you and you are working on your PhD). Plus your fianc\u00e9 is serious about you, so now you\u2019re a threat.\n\nNot saying racism isn\u2019t possible, but it\u2019s useful to know for sure what the reasons are when dealing with it.", "NTA", "Super NTA", "NTA for being petty to the ex wife but ultimately it can hurt the kids and you seems to love them so maybe just ask on the downlow.", "NTA\n \nSetting aside the very real possibility that she's racist, she could also just be worried that their kids like you more than her. Which, with her nutso behaviour, I could hardly be surprised if that's the case\n \nBut even if that's her fear, it doesn't excuse her behaviour, and boundaries do need to be established", "NTA she is threatened by you as you are more educated but seriously your fiance needs to deal with her and set her straight.", "NTA. Think, this might be why he left her.", "YTA \n\nWhy would you draw a line regarding his parents ( the kid's actual grandparents ) watching them? Shouldn't you be drawing the lines, any lines only where *YOU* and your time are being asked? I don't get how you'd be more upset about their grandparents watching them than you would be about her racist nonsense *and* her imposition on *your* time. Your behaviour makes no sense to me. You've allowed her to impose last minute on your time but you object to the grandparents watching the kids?", "NTA. I understand, or empathize with, why she might not have a great first reaction to you. There\u2019s a lot of baggage here, it\u2019s understand weird for her. You\u2019re with her former husband, you\u2019re butting into a relationship with her kids\u2026 lots of challenging things to manage at first. Feelings do not excuse behavior, I\u2019m just saying this initial reaction is at least understandable. \n\nThere could be an eventual future world where you guys all get along and do favors back and forth\u2026 but the time between that future and the bad first impression would be marked by apologies, a rebuilding of trust and acceptance, and the creation of a relationship. That hasn\u2019t happened, we\u2019ve tried to just skip those steps. \n\nYou can\u2019t skip those steps.", "She has decided to be your enemy.  Plan accordingly.

Not his problem. \n\nIf their mom wants a favor she can ask. \n\nYou don\u2019t get special privileges for popping some grandkids out. \n\nOPs husband is not bio moms husband.

If mom is interested in doing something for the kids she would stop booking vacations and stay with her kids during her time with them.", "This is the right way to go about it, I understand. But, she has had more than a few times to make things right (kids birthdays etc). She definitely walked all over her ex husband before, and I don\u2019t want to give her the chance to do that with me. When my fianc\u00e9 wanted to introduce me to her and her husband (I had already met the kids and it\u2019s been almost a year) since he wanted her to know the woman her kids would be living with, her reaction was \u2018do we have to?\u2019 She just has been off since the beginning, I don\u2019t have the energy to teach a 42 year old some manners.", "The kids like you vs the didn\u2019t like the other girlfriend .

Done. She doesnt have a problem that you are her exes gf. She is just a racist. And you need to bring this up infront of everyone and seperately with your husband.", "I don't know if it is the fact that you are black as some mention, but I believe it is because the children like you so much.  Because she is their mom, she wanted to think that no step parent could possibly be as good to her children or vice versa.  So seeing how much they like you is more than likely a threat to her.  She would feel much better about you if the kids acted out toward you in a negative way.  But they don't, so she does.\n\nKeep your relationship with the kids on a positive note and don't worry about their mom.  They are old enough that they will see through her BS and realize what a good person you are.\n\nGood Luck, NTA", "You say you don\u2019t want to go the extra mile for her. But are you asked to do so? Your fianc\u00e9 is asked to ask his parents? Where in this is something asked of you? Am I missing something?\n\nAnd she was rude. And she is disorganized. And she sounds like an asshole. But still, my questions above.", "Listen, the woman is an asshole. I think we can all agree to that.

Don\u2019t get in the middle of that. \n\nAnd \u201cyou\u201d are not fixing her problem; your fianc\u00e9 is and he is doing so in a way that won\u2019t disrupt your life. And the problem is related to your fianc\u00e9\u2019s kids so there is that too.\n\nIf her being disorganized disturbs you, and it should as it tends to affect your life, ask your fianc\u00e9 if he can discuss boundaries and better scheduling with her so she stops pulling things like that.\n\nBut if, within those established boundaries, the man decides to ask _his_ parents a favor, why do you want to get in the middle of that?", "Oh no. No no. Noooo. You said you can\u2019t and they did it anyway. Bio mom needs to have some natural consequences for booking a trip knowing she didn\u2019t cover her responsibilities. Tell her to cancel or take care of it herself. Your husband needs to stop entertaining this nonsense. I really think this should be part of the OP. It makes a huge difference.", "I understand", "Alternatively, maybe she just doesn\u2019t like you because the kids love you. She feels threatened, and this the result. Seems like the simplest theory.", "Lol!! So true.", "The 'extra mile' here is being asked to take care of the kids or orchestrate getting them taken care of by someone else at a difficult and previously unscheduled time.", "Yeah this is what I don\u2019t get it\u2019s got nothing to do with her. This is between his ex and him why are you even getting involved", "Not to mention the kids are 15 and 17. Why would they not be able to stay at their dad\u2019s house because she has a work deadline? It\u2019s not like they\u2019re toddlers. Or she\u2019s the only adult in the house. \n\nOP, I get that the ex-wife has been childish with you. But you don\u2019t have to sink to the same level. You can be an adult and look out for the kids.

Thank you!", "You're black and also highly educated, my bet would be that she can't stand that and feels threatened on multiple levels and bigotry is feeding it. She's fine using you as 'the help' to make her life easier by asking you for all these favors, but she doesn't want to need to treat you like an equal or a member of the family.", "NTA. I\u2019m going with racist first, then insecure that her kids like you and that you are smart. And possibly add jealous on top of that. My only concern in this situation is if the kids somehow suffer. \n\nAnd already trilingual and possibly learning a fourth language!! You are a powerhouse!", "We are passed all that, aren\u2019t we?! We are at a point where the fianc\u00e9 can give a call to his parent and ask for a favor that OP says they will accept doing. It doesn\u2019t affect her.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I think boundaries need to be discussed and established between the fianc\u00e9 and the ex so she stops doing things like that. \n\nBut I also think that OP should have no say in what favor her fianc\u00e9 asks his parents, especially if said favor is asked because he wants to ensure _her_ life is not disrupted by the crazy ex.", ">You're black and also highly educated\n\nyup, how dare OP be a minority and so accomplished? Multilingual, Phd in a science field, the kids like her, etc etc! \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if ex-wife is feelin too small because of it. If that is the case, your man better be on your side and set boundaries. \n\nI, personally? Would not be present anywhere she is, regardless of racism or not!", "The boundary that needs to be established is exactly what OP is saying in this post. Fianc\u00e9 needs to tell bio mom to make her own damn phone calls if she wants favors. You don\u2019t get to disregard \u201cNo\u201d then demand your coparent fix what they didn\u2019t do and actually told you not to do. \nFianc\u00e9 calling parents to ask a favor literally reinforces this behavior and tells bio mom she can keep doing exactly what she\u2019s doing and there won\u2019t be a consequence. People like this don\u2019t change until you stop entertaining their wild requests and tell them to stop counting on you to be a pushover.", "Again, this is an issue between the fianc\u00e9 and the ex. And fianc\u00e9 can decide to call parents to ask for the favor if he wants if doing so is not crossing a boundary for _him_.\n\nOP can talk with fianc\u00e9 about her issues and boundaries that she thinks need to be in place. And she can define her own boundaries and insist on them being respected. But what might be a boundary for her might not be one for him if in his eyes it doesn\u2019t disrupt her life. And that is completely fine.\n\nThese people have a kid that is 17. They have known each other for ages. **OP can define boundaries of her interactions with the ex. And can insist on boundaries around interactions and decisions that affect her life. But boundaries around his interactions with ex that do not affect her (Eg: _him_ calling _his_ parents to ask for a favor) are his calls and his alone.**"]}
