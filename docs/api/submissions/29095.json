Him and I met 3 years ago, and got engaged within a year, getting married in 6 months. They have 2 kids, who are 17 and 15. The ex wife has been married for 4 years. \nThe kids and I have a super relationship! \n\nAnyways, fast forward to me meeting her the first time, she was super unfriendly and I spent the rest of the evening just talking to the kids. I was so confused because my fianc\u00e9 is super nice to her husband and her husband was very nice to me as well. I just brushed it off and told my fianc\u00e9 she might not like me too much. \n\nNow, last Christmas, the plan was to celebrate Christmas as a whole family but she said she didn\u2019t want me there. My fianc\u00e9 was super confused because the kids adored me (esp the 15 year old one) and didn\u2019t understand the reason. She said that she felt that I didn\u2019t want the kids to spend Christmas with their dad cause if I did I would just accept that I wasn\u2019t invited and my fianc\u00e9 would go alone. This was super hurtful because I have been nothing short of loving to her kids, tutoring them even when it was her week cause I have a PhD in a science field and both the parents (incl my fianc\u00e9) only finished high school so struggle with math and science. We ended up celebrating our own Christmas with the kids a few days earlier. \n\nNow since then she has also asked as several favors like taking the kids when it\u2019s her week cause she had a vacation she didn\u2019t expect etc. But now, she asked us to take the kids during a week that I have a major work deadline, so we said we couldn\u2019t. But then she asked if my fianc\u00e9 can arrange other things like ask his parents for her. I told him this is where I draw the line. I said she should find her own solutions and it\u2019s not up to us. I know I\u2019m being petty and his parents would probably agree but I don\u2019t want to go the extra mile for her cause she hasn\u2019t been kind nor has shown me any respect.

Not really sure what you are asking. The exwife sounds a bit hung up on your fiancee and this is not you battle to fight but your boyfreinds. HE has to deal with his ex wife not you.

And maybe, since she is often backing out of child care in the very last moment possible, just maybe, they may need to re-visit their arrangements as to with whom the kids are living.   \nYou are not a parent, so it is totally within your rights to not accommodate her requests, whenever they are not fitting your schedule.

She's never going to like you and you're never going to have an interaction with her that is not odd. But her behavior has changed to one where she is no longer trying to pull her children away from you.\n\nTwo, I think her request to your husband is so minor, that being that it is not directed toward you, you do not have a say in it, and that intervening is petty.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nNo further explanation needed", "NTA\n\nThis is a problem of her own making. It isn\u2019t an emergency. She\u2019s acting extremely entitled.", "For example, they had bought a last minute deal to NYC, and they got the deal. We had less than 2 weeks notice, and we still accommodated. For Christmas, her husband was of course invited since it was at their house. What puzzles me more is that my fianc\u00e9 has had one other serious girlfriend before me, and she was invited to Christmas. The only difference is that the kids didn\u2019t like the other old girlfriend and idk if it matters, but I am the first and only black gf he has dated.", "Yeah, of course, he can BUT this is again getting her way. She can ask her sisters or parents but she prefers that my fianc\u00e9 asks his parents because the kids like them better. This is where my dilemma is. If it is for the kids, yea, the grandparents are a better choice BUT, just this once, I prefer not to fix her problem until she shows me some respect.", "They are going on vacation together. This is also one of the reasons. They book tickets knowing that it\u2019s their week (even after we say we can\u2019t), and then they ask if we can! Super bizarre! In this case especially, she called and asked that they got a deal and have only ONE day to decide whether to buy it or not. They wanted us to decide if we can do it that week. We said we couldn\u2019t, but they still went ahead and booked. Now, 3 months later, they are back and said wait so you can\u2019t do this week? Can you ask your (my fianc\u00e9) parents?", "True! But the older one has special needs and isn\u2019t as self sufficient as a \u2018normal\u2019 17 year old including only eating home cooked meal, so it means that I will have to do more cooking than what I had planned during that week. He also doesn\u2019t go to school, so there is that.", "I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that absolutely matters. Up until that point I thought maybe she didn't like you because you were younger, or smarter, or prettier, or something simple, but black? It's Occam's Razor. When you have competing theories, the simplest is usually the right one. She's probably racist. Probably that sort of casual racist which would explain why you don't think it's that important, but it would be my guess.", "Unfortunately, it is possible that it is the case. You and fianc\u00e9 need to have a serious conversation with his ex about her behavior.", "Why are you part of that conversation?", "Why are you the one doing that?", "Yeah, I haven\u2019t thought about it until now. This makes a bit of sense given that she commented why I don\u2019t speak the language of their country the one and only time we met. I\u2019m trilingual btw but haven\u2019t yet put effort in speaking this specific language. Oh well, this is something to digest! Wouldn\u2019t have thought abt it if you hadn\u2019t said more on it, so thanks!", "Or it could be because the kids like you so much. Either she\u2019s racist or insecure and jealous that her kids might like you more. Other gf was safe because the kids clearly disliked her. Or C, all of the above. She could be an insecure, jealous and racist\u2026.", "I'm going with option C."]}
