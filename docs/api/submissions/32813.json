You have a child that needs to be protected from the tyrant child in this story.", "NTA. You honestly have a duty to protect your child. She was being bullied. Bio mom vetoes your decisions because she thinks being bio mom makes her right even though her son is making *her* adopted daughter (kinda, no?) feel unsafe in her own house. How awful.

Micah is your son because you adopted him. The issue of his mother vetoing disciplining him is something you should have resolved (or led to a split) long since. But if her attitude was that bio trumped adoptive for rule-making then she can\u2019t change that now. Overall this looks like ESH except your daughter.\n\nLook, Micah won\u2019t really want to stay with you, now that his mother can\u2019t affect your house rules and you won\u2019t have his sister wait on him. Give them a clear list of the rules and chores that you\u2019ll expect \u2014 none of this \u201cbut it\u2019s woman\u2019s work\u201d attitude will be acceptable \u2014 and Micah will drop you soon enough.

You can make an arrangement with your son and keep in touch with him but not at the expense your daughter\u2019s safety. Looks like mother also wants to you take both kids in .

Your daughter prefers to live with you because you won't tolerate her brother's bullying, laziness and misogynistic behavior. His mother puts Micah  1st because he's her favorite, she tolerates all his bad behavior and doesn't let you discipline him. This isn't abandonment but the consequences of their actions.

He's a little shit and you don't want to deal with him because of it, but I mean you did adopt him so you shouldn't just abandon him completely. Is there anything like maybe you get every other weekend and she gets the daughter every other weekend? His mom is enabling him to be a little shit and thinks that you are abandoning him because he's not your child. I would say don't just say you want nothing to do with him, but let them both know that it's your house so your rules. Your wife wouldn't let you parent him but now neither has a choice if he's going to be at your house. Let him know that means that his sister won't be his servant and he will be picking up after and doing things for himself.

It seems like you don't even want to tell him why you don't want him to live with you? He's 16. His behavior isn't going to change if you don't address this. And he's old enough to be able to hear that he treats people poorly. You don't have to be mean about it and call him names, but you should be able to calmly tell him that his actions in doing x, y, and z are why you didn't want custody of him too. If he comes around and changes, be ready to support him. If he doesn't, then maintain your boundaries that you won't tolerate being treated that way. \n\nNTA for protecting your daughter. That outweighs your obligation to your son.", "YTA\n\nYou know what's not going to help him stop being a shit? His dad abandoning him.", "YTA if you wash your hands of the kid you adopted just because he's a little jerk at 16 yeah. Now that you're divorced you'll be able to at least discipline him at your house.", "YTA. Definitely. He\u2019s a teenager that needs guidance and now you\u2019re letting Andrew Tate raise him instead of putting in any effort yourself. It sounds like you favor Hannah over him because he\u2019s not your bio kid, and that you resent him for not being \u201cyours\u201d. You\u2019re also punishing him over disagreements with your ex and it\u2019s really unfair to rope him into that. Can you grow up a little and try to help him out?

If Micah is bullying Hanna, put them on opposite custody schedule so they don't live together.", "I won't say that YTA, but a kid is a kid, even one that's hard to like. I mean...a lot of them are pretty unlikable at that age. If you legally adopted him, to me that implies a commitment up to the time he's an adult. And parenting isn't the same as being a friend, as I'm sure you know, so \"liking\" isn't really a relevant criterion.  You can offer him visits on your terms, under your rules. Or do things outside the home.  But this is a form of rejection that I don't think a child deserves.", "NTA.\n\nAnd this might work out. Now that your ex is gonna have to deal with Micah on her own, she\u2019ll see what kind of person he is.", "NTA  glad you and your daughter got out of that mess", "NTA \n\nI think you have a duty to try to Micah grow into a responsible adult.

And you've completely shunned him.\n\nDo you have to live with him? No. But you are TA for essentially cutting him out of your life, essentially saying, \"He's adopted, he's not really my child.\"\n\nReddit for the most part will not tell you these truths, because most of Reddit doesn't understand the sacred bond between an adoptive child and adoptive parent. Clearly, you don't either, and are looking for strangers to tell you that you are doing \"the right thing\" to abandon your son.\n\nDo you have it in you to do better? Or is \"abandoning your child\" the act that you want to define you?", "ESH (parents). You should have demanded the right to fully parent and discipline Micah when you adopted him.

Biology matters, adoptees shouldn\u2019t be expected to pretend it is completely irrelevant for the comfort of their adopters.\n\nYou chose this yourself, yet here you are and the only things you have to say about him are that he\u2019s a bully and that you aren\u2019t able to discipline him the way you want to discipline him.

I was mercilessly bullied growing up, so in response I tried to bully others to gain a sense of control (it didn\u2019t work).\n\nNow you just want to escape with the kid you like and stick your ex with the kid you don\u2019t like?

IMO, it sounds more like his wife favors Micah because he's her oldest son and has let him develop an unpleasant personality because of it, to the point that she lets him bully and make demands of his sister, who is as much her bio-kid as Micah is. She undermines OP's attempts at being a father anytime he tries to punish Micah for his bad behavior.
