Satan put your Dad into the horrible position of not being able to have a relationship with all of his kids 13 years ago, and through your actions you are trying to put him into the same position again now. I'm sure that is not what you are intending to do, but it's what you are doing.\n\nDon't punish Bella for having a horrible mother. That's not her fault.\n\nAnd don't punish her for what you believe she did when she was 10.

My mum just wants Dad to be happy and I can tell Bella isn't making him happy and Dad just feels bad about missing time with her but that's not his fault he's always been a great dad. She doesn't even call him Dad.", "No she was 10 when she came here it was for her 10th birthday. She was an asshole and said and done horrible things to my family and now she's come again and just caused problems between my mum and my dad I don't want to lose my family because of her I didn't mean to be an asshole im just so mad she's here", "I just want my Mum and Dad to be happy and okay and for things to go back to normal again, before Bella was here. My mum looks so sad but keeps putting on a happy face for us and it's Bella's fault for being here.\n\nMy mum was the one that let her into our home and then Bella told us all lies about what happened so Mum left because she didn't want to cause any problems but it was Bella who was causing them. \n\nI hate Bella and I hate her Mum. I hate what they both did to my Mum and to my Dad. \n\nMum said that Bella was only telling \"her truth\" of what she had been told by her mum when they were here but what about my mum and her feelings? My mum hasn't told anyone her side of things and we wouldn't of known the truth if it wasn't for my Nana. \n\nEven when Bella was told by Nana what happened and Nana even showed her the evidence Bella didn't want a bar of it and said she didn't know what to believe. \n\nMy mum shouldn't be protecting Bella, Bella's an adult. Why is she even here? It makes no sense to me. \n\nMy Mum just rung me and wants to have a family meeting and no doubt it's because of Bella. Everything always has to go Bella's way.", "She should of known better still she wouldn't like it if someone did to her mum what she did to mine", "My mum just rung me to have a family meeting and im guessing it's because of Bella. \n\nI know im the asshole for how I handled things im just really angry and want Bella to say sorry to my mum.", "You were two, the only way you would even know this is if your mom told you. You have second-hand knowledge that you are taking as the absolute truth. She was a CHILD the last time she was here.\n\nYou have no reason to be mad at anyone but your mother and father for not facilitating a relationship with your sister when she was younger.\n\nEDIT: And her mom IF she actually told your dad to choose. IF that happened.", "She was only 10. She was probably just doing whatever her mom told her to do or copying her moms behaviour. \n\nShe's now 22 so hopefully she's matured since then. I understand that you are scared about losing your family, but even if your parents were to split up it doesn't mean you'd lose them...and lashing out at your half-sister won't save your parents marriage if your mom is already worn out by all of this. At the end of the day, it sounds like your mom doesn't want you to try and interfere. \n\nI get that you want to protect your mom, but you won't do that by beating your sister down. It might be helpful to speak to your mom about why you did this, the fear you have about your parents breaking up, and also understand that your sister has also been through a lot. It's probably wasn't easy having Satan as her mother and a dad that Satan wouldn't let her see lol. \n\nIf she is being pleasant to you guys then be pleasant back, and let your brother know that he doesn't have to hate her.\n\nIf I were you, I'd apologize for the way you treated her.", "I know it\u2019s hard because you\u2019re literally missing parts of your brain, but stop being mean and cruel to Bella.", "Stop arguing back and accept the judgment.", "I get that, and I hope she does.\n\nHowever, if she doesn\u2019t please don\u2019t take it out on her further. She was 10. More than likely manipulated by her mother against your own.\n\nYour mum should understand that, you are likely misunderstanding the situation yourself.", "You ain\u2019t be able to appreciate for many years the MAGNITUDE of your AH-ness right now.", "No actually. My mum has always made sure to tell me about my sister and it's not my mum or my dads fault that her mum was a bitch. If it wasn't for my mum we would of never met her and I don't blame my mum for not carrying trying or my dad. She doesn't even call my Dad, Dad and said her step dad is her Dad. She didn't even call Dad, Dad when she was here. \n\nI know all of this because of my sister tried to turn us all against my mum when she arrived that's why mum left & my Nana (Dads mum) told me the truth about what had happened & pulled out all of the court documents and emails and videos of it to show me & my sister admitted to it all as well after I found out the truth and said she doesn't feel the need to apologise to my Mum because my Mum should already know she was just a kid and was being manipulated but I don't care she should apologise. \n\nI also asked my sisters what they remember and they told me and I asked my Dad and he told me. The only one I care about is my Mum and Bella needs to piss off.", "Yes I know that, but then why come here now at 22 and then tell me and my siblings all of this bad stuff my mum apparently did when she was 10 only for us to find out that wasn't what happened when my dads mum told us the truth and she won't even apologise to my mum for anything. \n\nI'll apologise to her when she apologises to my mum first. \n\nI'm going to talk to my mum tonight about things again but she just keeps saying that I shouldn't be angry with my sister and that what happens between her and Dad isn't anyone's fault other than their own. I feel like my sisters just came here to try and split them up again & my dad is just letting her. Mum wants me to go to therapy and wants us all to do family therapy but if Bella just goes then everything will be normal again.", "You\u2019re very young, so it\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re having big feelings and want things to go back to how they were, but you\u2019re also old enough to understand that life is complicated. Your older sister is your dads daughter, and he loves her just like he loves you. She was a child and she and your dad were both victims of parental alienation that has cost them years of their relationship. Rebuilding that after its been damaged can be hard. \n\nI also know that when you feel like this it\u2019s partially because no one listens to you or your opinion. And part of that is because you haven\u2019t got the life experience or skills to really think about what the real causes of your emotions are and how to healthily express them. Therapy could actually help you to learn ways to interrogate your feelings and find ways to express them that your parents might understand. \n\nShe\u2019s not going anywhere, and you weren\u2019t old enough to be involved at the time things went down. You\u2019re angry that Bella spending time with your dad is messing up the comfortable dynamic, but OP, it wasn\u2019t comfortable for your dad. There was always a Bella-shaped hole in it for him, because Satan manipulated and abused Bella by alienating her from her/your dad. And your mom may be having to make adjustments with Bella around and the old hurts that were caused, but Bella was a child. It wasn\u2019t her fault that Satan manipulated her. And she knows that her husband having a relationship with his daughter is important. \n\nYou\u2019re important too, and your feelings matter, but they are not going to change the basic facts that Bella was not at fault. Or make her go away. You are free to never think of her as a sister/like her, but expressing your feelings by lashing out at her will do nothing but cause YOU to keep feeling hurt. \n\nTherapy is a good idea. You should also ask about having an individual therapist where you can safely talk through the things you hate about her, the situation, etc."]}
