In that case, an immediate demand to vacate the premises would be justified, by just one partner. \n\nBut, once she's there, and she's not threatening anybody or causing property damage, I think you need to make the decision *as a couple* to change Drew's living arrangements. What you did was not fair to your partner, Bree was a stakeholder in this situation and you ignored her. Even if you disagreed, at least you would have included her in the discussion.\n\nAnd the thing is -- IF you had talked about it ahead of time, she might have agreed to ask Drew to leave anyway.

Either way, she at deserved the courtesy of a heads-up: this wasn\u2019t a situation where Drew did something so egregious in the moment (like you caught her dealing drugs from your house) that she had to go immediately.\n\nIt sounds like you and your wife have a communication/trust problem.\n\nEdit: I agree that it sounds like Drew needed to go.

Otherwise, you would have had to go through the eviction process because she'd stayed with you long enough to be considered a tenant, whether you thought of her as one or not.\n\nI get Bree is trying to be a good and supportive friend.  I think Bree needs to focus on being a good and supportive spouse.", "NTA, but should have handled it better.", "NTA for telling Drew she had to go, however you really should had talked this over with your wife since it's her home too and her friend. So you're the AH for that. \nI totally understand where you are coming from, but I also understand Drew's side and your wife's side. \nDrew is trying to find her footing after divorce and probably feels like she doesn't have anyone except Bree. However, that does not give her the right to trample all over your boundaries and invade your space.", "Yeah, but Bree already had multiple conversations with Drew, and Drew just got more clingy. Bree fucked up. She should've dealt with it. She didn't. So OP did what she had to do.", "And also legally, you can't just kick out someone who has been staying at your place for a long amount of time, although there's probably a good chance Drew wouldn't fight about it.\n\nI do think op is an asshole though, not because of what she felt or for wanting Drew to move out, but how she went about it is terrible, and I've been in a similar situation.  Op needed to talk to her wife and come to Drew with a firm plan.  \n\nBecause while drew was certainly being annoying, she doesn't seem to have been a danger, or costing huge amounts of extra money, or doing anything perverted or whatever.  This moment of \"get out by the end of the week\" both isn't fair practically, and is potentially a friendship ruiner.", "So.... that's an overall YTA? Not sure how the auto-system tags things, but I THINK it's based on the first initial it sees.", "I suppose it all depends on where OP lives. Where i am someone living for more than 14 days, or simply receiving mail has tenant rights. I don't blame OP for wanting them out of the house at all. It seems insufferable, and will only get worse as the pregnancy progresses and eventually the baby arrives. I fear OP doesn't realize the potential legal issues and it could make the situation much more difficult. Shoot, in my area squatters have nearly taken over a neighbor's vacant house on the market, just because they received mail there. Be careful OP and cover your rear. It might seem ridiculous, but she could have legal recourse depending on where you live.", "Agree with your point, but given she didn't tell her partner that she was kicking drew out, I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't communicate \"date night\" vs let's go to a restaurant tonight.", "Exactly. OP, your primary problem is between you and your wife. Why was she not able to set firmer boundaries with the guest even though it gravely impacted you and your relationship? And why were you not able to tell your wife that you were at the end of your rope and want the guest gone in a week before you went to the guest directly?\n\nI hope you can get together and sort it out.", "And if she's recently paid OP rent money she should get that back if she's paid for time she won't be there", "NTA\n\nIf Drew was a good friend to your wife, she would have respected her boundaries. No friends that respects you will ignore your bondaries, so yeah Drew overstayed her welcome.\n\nAlso, who tf would want to thirdwheel a date ???", "YTA, this should have been a joint decision. And you unilaterally chucked her friend out with whom you had committed to being able to stay for 6 months.\n\nYou haven't once considered that this is baby hormones causing what sounds like jealousy.\n\nRather than pissing up a tree to mark your territory, try communicating with you wife and letting her have an equal say in how things move forward.", "3 months is way too long. NTA", "Esh", "NTA.  \nTrampling boundaries gets you out on the street. Kick rocks.", "It sounds like you're jealous. Not judging, but it was really Bree's problem to solve, not yours.", "NTA overall.. YTA for no warning to Bree - however the fact that Drew has not contacted Bree since demonstrates an immaturity and lack of empathy on her (Drew\u2019s ) part for causing / exacerbating the situation and not taking responsibility for your reaction to it .. either she will reach out and apologise or she was using you guys as a crutch for her mental stability..", "NTA", "Candlelight and moonlight all around us\nI look into your eyes\nYou hold my hand underneath the table\nAnd I can't disguise the way I feel\n\nI could've wished a thousand wishes\nFor this night, I can't believe\nThat it's finally me and you, and you and me\nJust us, and your friend DREW", "Idk if I would consider it being taken advantage of. OP did say that Drew was paying rent and cooking sometimes as well. If anything I feel like they set themselves up for failure with this. The friend who is going through a life-altering divorce is clingy/needy during this shitty time in their life? Shocker.", "Also, not a girl"]}
