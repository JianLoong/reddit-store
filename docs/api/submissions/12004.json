I used to gently put the bar down during C&Js and my trainer told me that was a good way to ensure a back injury.", "I'm just finding out from this post. I'm not very tuned into gym culture, but I definitely thought the dropping thing was supposed to be macho or something.", "I have a small private gym in my building. There was a girl once having a FaceTime call for her entire workout who got mad when my partner and I started using boxing gloves.", "Found the dude who can't lift.", "You can be annoyed at it but keep it to yourself.\n\nIt\u2019s a you problem.\n\nEdit - sorry I didn\u2019t realize you were the og Commentor, went back and read your comment where you said you wouldn\u2019t do/say anything abt it. Ignore me.", "Everyone read what you said.\n\nI don\u2019t care that you wouldn\u2019t say anything, I\u2019m not calling you out for gym behavior, I\u2019m calling you out for being needlessly insulting on Reddit, where we both are.", "A beginning and middle where he listened to the guy, said he\u2019d try his best to be quieter, and then wasn\u2019t given a chance before the guy continued tapping him and started directly insulting him with the ego lifting asshole comments?", "It normally is! But there are *some* workouts in which it's a real thing.", "And categorizing yourself as someone \"who can lift\", do you think your ego has any part in that? The irony", ">Why? \n\n\nI've tried to work out around these types, and the random, startling noise is extremely annoying.", "some men in my gym make noise as if they are training for their next gay porn. It can be really disturbing. Necessary noise because its heavy? Yes. Make noise for attention while you lift as much as a girl? No.", "You were in the room and heard what OP's coach told him to do? Wow. What a coincidence you being there and over hearing the instructions OP received.", "Are you still mad at every sports ball player from high school or something", "I never made that claim actually. Funnily enough you did make that claim. The irony is real, you just missed it.", "As a bystander who really only does the machines at the gym quietly, literally the only ego we see is from you. You\u2019re acting pathetic.\n\nWhy should I care if someone wants to have muscles, anyway? Maybe it makes them feel better about themselves. Gives them confidence. Sure, that\u2019s technically the \u201cego,\u201d but do you call everyone who wants to feel comfortable in their body an egomaniac or just the ones that lift differently than you?", "Please re-read what I said. I am not interested in a heated meaningless argument.", "You implied it actually because who in their right mind would go around insulting people with a category that they self-identify with?", "It wasn't an insult, it was a factual statement that you supported with your ignorance on how both presses and jerks work.", "I said the end position is same as military press. Which it is: https://youtu.be/9HyWjAk7fhY \n\nYou're being quite aggressive without reason and you don't seem open to listen so I won't respond more. But maybe google \"eccentric cleand and jerk\" or \"how to do clean and jerk more quietly\" if you're interested in actually learning something.", "We both know it was an insult. It wasn't factual and you have no way of actually knowing the facts. If we want to talk about the truth and not just continue throwing baseless insults. If you want to know my experience you can simply ask me my max lifts", "The end of any type of press, including a jerk, is the same. What's your point?  Sorry, but you just don't know what you're talking about.  If people can't stand the sound of weights dropping, then they need to go to a planet fitness where no one does Olympic weightlifting. I would also never do an \"eccentric\" clean and jerk, I don't want any injuries.  But like I said, best of luck to you. I hope your insurance covers your PT bills. That is, if you even work out \ud83d\ude05", "And trust someone who is clearly a braggart and is lying about knowing what the coach said or didn't say to be honest about that? No thanks."]}
