Idk I don't go to gyms but doesn't everyone just normally do their own thing. If you have insecurities there's other places to do workouts.", "NTA \n\n\nThey need to mind their business and work on their own fitness instead of worrying about you.

You were minding your own business.", "NTA - I\u2019m firmly of the opinion that the only time someone should talk to you at the gym is if they need a spotter.

Obviously the noise should be within reason but, from what you were saying, all the disturbances that were made were just expected. Gym is like the most common place to mind your own business and do you own stuff and go home; I don\u2019t know why he was so focused on you lol?\n\nHe sounds insecure but no OP, I don\u2019t think you were in the wrong for going to the gym and gyming even if it was too obnoxious for the very intrusive man lol.", "NTA.

They should not have bothered you about your training. Could you have worded it better? Yes. Did you have to? No. The moment you said you weren't showing off and there were no rules against it, they should have left it alone, but choose not to.", "NTA. Yes it could have been worded better, but this guy had it coming. You were minding your own business and this random person comes up and tries to dictate your workout. Not cool.", "I mean, NAH, yeah you could\u2019ve probably worded it better, but what an interesting way to announce he\u2019s never seen an athlete before lmao. Dude was just not very bright and too insecure", "INFO: Were you also grunting with those lifts?", "This is tough. The way you phrase it, from your perspective, you were doing nothing wrong and this guy was just flipping out, aggressively.  If that's the case, being aggressive back is not required, but also not quite asshole-level if you do.   \n\n\nThe thing is, an impartial observer that knows the culture of the place you were in may well say that you were out of line.  Maybe the guy wasn't completely flipping out.. maybe he had a point, but you'd have no way to know because you shut him down completely. By your own admission, **you didn't care whether he had a valid point**.   \n\n\nGiven how quickly you responded rudely, there's a reasonable chance that actually YTA, but we'll never know.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
