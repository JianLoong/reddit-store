{"id": 27537, "submission_id": "16qwdcg", "title": "AITA for not giving a 30+ year friend's debut novel a five star review?", "selftext": "A beloved friend of 30+ years published a book.   It's on a \"real\" press, and has received glowing jacket blurbs from a number of big-name authors.\n\nI write a lot of book reviews and have hundreds of followers. I write detailed, honest reviews.\n\nI gave the novel a 4-star ranking, a detailed and praise-laden review, with no negative commentary, nor any caveats on why I withheld the fifth star.\n\nThe book is good, ambitious in scope, and a serious accomplishment. But I reserve five-star rankings for superb, nearly flawless, \"I would read it again tomorrow!\" literature.  I anticipated that even that level of  couched, or implied \"critique\" would likely draw fire, so I opted to not qualify the 4 stars in any way.  It was a 100% positive review that I thought would entice readers because of its detail and specificity.\n\nThe friend contacted me asking \"Did you mean to give a 4-star ranking on Amazon? If you did, just take it down!\" They followed by issuing a second demand, \"And take it down on Goodreads, too!\"\n\nBefore I could reply or take action, the author's partner wrote into the same group chat, \"As you know, we are pouring our hearts, souls and finances into marketing this book,<name>. Initial ratings are incredibly important and anything less than five stars is unhelpful. Very unhelpful. We will get our share of lesser ratings, but we don\u2019t expect them from a friend who understands their impact.\"\n\nI spent an afternoon thinking how to respond: Change the ranking to 5, and be a \"liar\" for a good friend? I mean, not a lot of skin off my nose, but I honestly had not expected a demand for an \"expected\" 5 star review.\n\nOr, should I honor the initial request by the author, and simply take down the review?  I literally read the request as being that: If you can't give five stars, take it down. (I read a lot of things literally.)\n\nI opted to honor the request to take the review down. I replied, and I quote: \"If you feel that a 100% positive, detailed, four star review is detrimental to your sales, I will honor your request to remove the review for now. The last thing I would want to do is hurt you. Or your sales.\"\n\nThis did not go over well. I was accused of stabbing them in the back, and berated for daring to issue anything less than 5 stars, when an author had blurbed \"This is destined to be a classic.\" How could I possibly disagree? I didn't disagree. But, I note that the author did not give a star-rating with his blurb.\n\nWithout diverting into a completely different debate on the ASD \"spectrum,\" I have been known to have a hard time understanding unwritten social rules, or know \"common sense\" in matters like these.\n\nI am truly bereft thinking that this issue could torpedo an incredible, long-lasting friendship.\n\n\\[edited; misuse of apostrophe in possessive \"its\"\\]\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1695557915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16qwdcg/aita_for_not_giving_a_30_year_friends_debut_novel/", "score": 3816, "replies": ["NTA,  it was a thorough review, and you were being honest.  I'd prefer an honest review than a pity one.  I would take the review down and tell my friends that I would not be engaging regarding their work in the future.

But OP, just keep in mind, sometimes friends do nice things for each other like give 5 stars simply because they are friends. In cases like that, it\u2019s not really necessary to give a totally honest review. They\u2019re your friend, they released a book, just support it. I get why they felt you backstabbed them, though obviously you didn\u2019t mean to. Just explain your reasoning and add the context about your ASD.", "I mean, I would always give my friend\u2019s endeavors 5 stars. It costs you nothing. YTA", "I'm waffling between YTA and ESH. \n\nFirst off, YTA for not giving 5 stars. You said it was a great book, written by a friend of 30+ years and you couldn't just give it 5 stars? I have Autism and thats not really an excuse for what you did. \n\nHowever, your friend reacted in a terrible way as well. I'm putting myself in their shoes, and tbh I would be pissed. However, I wouldn't have reacted the way they did. \n\nSo, I guess ESH.", "I am with you in the asd spectrum, and find your review totally fair. That being said, life has teach me a lot, and I know that, in most socially approached reviews (amazon, rotten tomatoes, etc) first reviews influence the subsequents ones a lot, that affects the algorithm, and that affects the sales. So your friends probably really need only 5 stars reviews, and may even have expected them from friends and family. Now, I need this things spell to me, cause I\u2019m not one to catch on this clues. Also I\u2019ve noticed people are very emotional (and appear to me even verbally abusive) when they feel criticized. At the moment, they probably felt your 4 stars as a critique and even detrimental to their economy, as it has long terms effects for them. The fair thing is to take it down, apologize and explain (briefly) your pov. I would also never again comment or review anything coming from this friends, as they were not able to explain this calmly to you, even when they have known you for years. This is not being petty but protective of one self when one do not quite understand social clues as others do. Thats fair for everyone. Hope this resolves well OP! Apologies for any grammar error, as english is not my native language.", "NTA. You can't ask someone to honestly rate something then be annoyed that they did. They want you to big it up, not share your honest thoughts - which defeats the point of a review.\n\nIt's like when every media outlet says \"this is the best Marvel movie YET!!!\". You know it isn't, they know it isn't, but they're too scared to be cut off from the next one that they fawn over it and end up looking like idiots.\n\nNot everything is 5 Stars, and that's fine. Not everyone is going to love something. But if my only choices are being bullied into gushing about something more than I cared for it, or removing my review, I know where I'd rather stand.", "NTA at all.\n\nThis is quite a sensible approach and the way you conveyed also seemed fine, there's no need to overthink this. However you'll need to rethink if this friendship is worth the value you'd placed on it since honesty is not something they value, and though we don't know more about your personality, there definitely wasn't scope for said person to use words like 'backstabbing' and the likes for this matter. \n\nIt just shows their ethics. Let them be and you should have kept the original rating though. Or maybe re-read the book in some time to see if it excites you as much and put out a new review. As time passes you'll forget this temporarily, just enough to focus on the content and not let the friendship influence your feedback.", "Isn\u2019t this a repost?", "NTA. I specifically ignore 5 star reviews because so many people get friends to leave them or will just buy reviews.\n\nTo me, a glowing 4 star is worth much more.", "When i look at something on Amazon and see it has all 5 star reviews i get suspicious and wonder if its all from friends and family. I will even look at the dates of the reviews to see if they were given all in the same day or week. Often they don\u2019t have narratives. It is the written reviews i look for. OP, you are NTA. Your friends are. Asking for 5 star reviews can certainly over inflate how something is received only to later thoroughly disappoint, causing a much more negative review.", "NTA. People shouldn\u2019t publish a book if they can\u2019t handle honest reviews.", "ESH.  You gave a \u201cbeloved friend\u201d a 4 star review not because you had any actual criticism, but because it lacked a Je ne sais quoi?  Geez, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not my friend.  I would think it would be reasonable that the author would be disappointed, but \u201cberating\u201d you is over the top.  They are not entitled to 5 star reviews.", "I just don\u2019t understand this whole conversation because I don\u2019t trust five stars on a rating system, if that\u2019s all there are. I assume they\u2019re paid for and not honest. Especially on Amazon, but I also use Fakespot in my research as well.", "I will confer a soft YTA. \n\nSoft because of your ASD, which I think is manifesting here as justice or fairness sensitivity. As someone with BPD \u2014 a disorder also marked often, but not always, by inflated righteousness \u2014 I say this with kindness: but the world is not black and white. The logistical heuristics that seamlessly guide our actions comport to others without these disorders are truculence and rigidity. \n\nUntil recently I prided myself on being scrupulous, perhaps even obstinately principled. But therapy helped me realize that my binary/black and white thinking, while neutral or at times useful in the abstract, is a maladaptation in a world that runs on social fuel. I was therefore, like you, operating as a principled deontologist in a social enterprise comprised of social utilitarians. \n\nWhile we need not understand what seems to us like logically aberrant behaviour, we need understand the social and emotional ramifications of our intransigence. In this instance, offering a five star review is a small kindness to your friend, that happens to contravene your internal sense of judgment. \n\nAs you articulate, you find their perspective illogical. But from the standpoint of mitigating needless harm and maintaining social bonds, your perspective is illogical. The work the neurodivergent must do is according both rubrics simultaneously.", "It was an 80% positive review. You gave it 4 stars. A 100% positive review would have been 5 stars. Do the math.", "NTA. Sounds ridiculous and is another in a long list of reasons why the internet mostly sucks now.", "YTA. It\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s not gonna hurt you to give a good friend another star, especially when these numerical ratings mean so much on platforms like Amazon. You don\u2019t think it\u2019s a 5 star book? Whatever dude, don\u2019t read it again? Just be nice? It doesn\u2019t take anything out of your day, and it\u2019s not like this is some random author, it\u2019s a presumably good friend.", "YTA. You're reviewing your friend's book on Amazon, not the New York Times.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m going to answer from the  perspective of a reader. When I\u2019m looking at book reviews, I want honesty, not friends trying to help boost sales. The purpose of a review is to help other people decide if they want to read it, and inflated scores to be a good friend are just hindering that process. \n\nI agree with those who say 5-star reviews should be reserved for amazing, blew-me-away books that you want to read again. Tbh, I think that\u2019s how most readers view them. Four stars means it was a really good book, and that\u2019s valuable too. I\u2019ll read a four-star book. Five gets my attention more strongly. \n\nI think taking down the review was a fine solution but think the author was rude about it and has no business being angry at the reviewer, their friend. You want more five star reviews? Write a better book and don\u2019t berate your friends for not lying.", "Yta- no one asked for your \u201chonest\u201d review on Amazon. You should give it 5 stars just to help your friend sell more books. Your opinion isn\u2019t actually important in this situation", "NTA, I think 4 stars is a very good rating. Most people are more likely writing a negative review than positive one. Your friend badgering you is very unprofessional.", "YTA, Amazon reviews are not that serious. Do what\u2019s best for your friend and don\u2019t be so stingy with your stars.", ">I write a lot of book reviews and have hundreds of followers.\n\nThis sounds like someone who takes themselves waaaayyyy too seriously.

Like come on, it\u2019s not like you actually are providing value here with your reviews.\n\nI\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re autistic, but you\u2019re literally willing to end a friendship because you think the \u201cintegrity\u201d of your Amazon reviews are more important. Sheesh. Yes YTA.", "Yta. You have no real reason to withhold a star. Who\u2019s going to read your review? Close to no one but the 4 star will hurt his overall rating.", "NTA. Amazon is literally flooded with mediocre to shit tier products based on 5 star review farming. They asked you for your review and you gave your review. If you didn't feel it was 5 stars, it is what it is. If anything, you now wasted your time crafting a detailed review for nothing because they did not properly communicate their expectations.", "NTA ever", "YTA.", "I think it\u2019s a bit rude of them to both simultaneously demand you take it down rather than do it politely.", "YTA.\n\n\nYou're not a professional book critic and you're not writing on a professional platform.\n\nThis is a freaking Amazon review.\n\nYou're a lousy friend", "NTA. I\u2019m a book reviewer on social media too, and I think honesty is really important when cultivating a platform and an audience. I\u2019m really sorry that you had to delete the review and that this experience has damaged your friendship. \n\nIn my experience working with authors, I\u2019ve never seen an author be visibly unhappy with a four star review. When I work with company like BookSirens, they consider anything 3 stars or above to be a good review, and many Book Tour companies consider four stars to be a good review. \n\nReviewing books written by friends can be tricky, and I think your friend has to understand that this isn\u2019t personal. Your reputation and authenticity with your audience is important if you want to keep reviewing. You gave your friend a very generous review and I don\u2019t think you having anything to be sorry about.", "Edit to YTA; previously N T A because this is a professional review about a product for sale, not commenting about someone\u2019s contribution at a potluck. That said, if someone is a close friend of yours, probably best to just not review their material. It\u2019s just too rife with pitfalls because so many people can\u2019t differentiate personal from professional, especially when the industry is creative/artistic in nature.\n\nEdit: just realized OP is not reviewing as part of their job. So yeah, that was a dick move to post a review knowing that it would harm them when you could have just skipped it.", "NTA. You're allowed to review books anyway you see fit and to follow your own code of ethics. The author is allowed to not like it, but that's reviews for you. \n\nThe author initially reached out and demanded you take it down.

You would be, however, if you made a fake review. Your friend is out of line.", "YTA obviously.But......What is the name of the book? Am I the only one who really wants to read it now?", "YTA. You risked your friendship and your friends livelihood so you can maintain your integrity as an Amazon reviewer. That's pathetic.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. Especially as the author\u2019s main concern is sales. Not that they produced a work they believe was outstanding and felt the review did not reflect that.", "The reason I'm going with ESH is because you didn't explain your 4 star and, quite frankly, your level for 5 star is laughable to me. I always hate when reviews don't explain why they gave the star they did. If you don't have any complaints beside the fact you wouldn't reread it tomorrow then it should be 5 star. Everything you've said about the books sounds like it should be 5 star except for your ridiculous standard.\n\nThat being said, your friend is being way too aggressive and demeaning over a positive, though not full 5 star, review. I understand that 5 stars is needed for promoting because of how a lot of retailers work, but that doesn't make it okay to treat a friend how your friend is treating you.", "ESH - it doesn't sound like you're a professional book critic, and giving a 5-Star review to a book you legitimately enjoyed written by a long-time friend isn't an unreasonable ask. That said, it does sound like the way your friends are handling it is a bit melodramatic. One 4-Star review with a thorough positive review with no negative criticism isn't going to massively impact their sales.", "NTA .", "YTA, I am 100% sure other authors friends give 5 star reviews to their friend without even reading the book.  In this case objectivity can be bent just a little for friendship's sake.", "NTA\n\nWhile it would have been a nice gesture to bump it up to a 5 star rating, it is first of all still your own rating and second of all they should have been nice about it. I am not a fan of the manipulation going on for these ratings but at least if someone asks nicely and there is not much of an issue itself (as you said your review is very positive) I might consider doing it.\n\nBut if they get aggressive and try to peer pressure me into giving 5 stars, they are not friends. Just assholes you know.\n\nMy petty ass might put an edit into the review, ranking it down to 3 or 2 stars and writing that due to the aggressive nature of the author against non 5 star reviews you don't feel comfortable supporting them.", "YTA\n\nI've given five or ten-star ratings to perfect strangers (in retail or something) because I learned that the corporate overlord algorithm settings reject anything under perfect as, essentially, zero. It's all or nothing. I don't know how it works with book sales, but yeah, lesser ratings probably do end up with very real effects on when, where, and how the book is sold.\n\nThis is a weird hill to die on. You're not a professional book critic, right?", "NAH. Are you by any chance autistic? I think this is one of those instances where it\u2019s okay to be dishonest. It\u2019s just for a good friend. Sometimes navigating friendships can be a little tricky but if you don\u2019t want to damage this one, I would definitely give them 5 stars.", "NTA. Posting 5 stars just to be nice renders the whole rating system pointless.", "I mean, this is one of those things where *socially* you\u2019re absolutely YTA. 5 star reviews are important and mean something, especially for debuts. These are things you do for friends and you shouldn\u2019t even have to think twice about it, especially if you genuinely believe the novel to be very very good without meaningful criticism. It doesn\u2019t meaningfully hurt you at all to fudge a little but it IS meaningfully hurtful for your friend for you to give them less than 5 stars. I admit I really, really can\u2019t understand you rigidity here and why you wouldn\u2019t want to help your friend.", "NTA. I am an avid book reader, and always have been and I\u2019m not going to give a five star review just because somebody I know wrote a book. One it\u2019s false advertising because when people pay attention to book reviews and want to read it based on five star reviews. I\u2019d be disappointed if I read it and didn\u2019t find it that good. You should\u2019ve left the review up. It was honest it was four stars. It wasn\u2019t gonna hurt the book sales I\u2019m sorry they just want five stars to be greedy.", "YTA. As a human, I\u2019d never do that to a friend.

This is for a friend, and would cost you nothing as a person and friend (for now) to give them a 5 star review. Do you have so many friends that you don\u2019t need this friend?

If you\u2019re gonna mark down the rating, it\u2019s your *responsibility* to explain why. I am driven away from books that are rated less than 5 stars but people don\u2019t say why. You really could be hurting your friend\u2019s efforts.", "You should ask your friend, \"Do they want an honest review from you,\" or do they just want a 5 star rating?", "YTA cause they're a friend so maybe just give friends a five star? I don't think this is worth losing a friend over unless you're the book reviewer for the New York Times or something.

They directly manipulate behind-the-scenes algorithms and decide whether or not a book gets promoted or vanishes into the swamps of Amazon. \n\nIs this fair? Fuck, no. It's awful. It's stupid. But it's still true. If you review something on Amazon, and that review is not five stars, you are directly hurting the book.

And if anyone asks, you fully and perfectly endorse it so others can enjoy it. It is just part of being a friend. \n\nThe issue here is not about 4 or 5 stars - it is about you putting some strange, arbitrary rules about 5 star reviews above helping a friend of thirty years the most you possibly could. Even if you feel this would be a 'sacrifice' or challenge some type of artistic integrity, this is really not the time for die on that hill.  It would cost you nothing to give it 5 stars so compared to the legitimate hurt it can be for a friend to feel you judging their material.

I give out hundreds of advanced review copies and while negative reviews can sting, they're to be expected. It comes with the territory. Every author gets them. However, my ARCs go out to strangers/general readers. I never ask any friends or family to review my books. #1) Because I don't expect all my friends and family to be fans of my genre and because I don't want to pressure them, and #2) Because if you post a review to Amazon and Amazon discovers you have a personal connection to the author, they might take it down anyway.\n\nThat said, I've had friends post five star reviews for my books without me asking. And as a FRIEND, I've also had other writer friends ask me to post reviews of their books and I've done it as requested, under my personal account that isn't linked to my author/business account or pen name. I'd never dream of leaving less than a five star review for a friend, especially for their debut novel. It really can drag down an average when just getting started and there are few reviews to begin with, and I put my friendship with them above my pride. I also beta read for friends and give them honest feedback as to how I feel a story can improve, but any criticism is given to them behind the scenes and they take it in stride. That five star review, on the other hand, is a show of public support for a friend who's just done something huge and likely outside their comfort zone.\n\nBottom line, while there is nothing wrong with posting honest reviews, I'm still going against the grain with a light YTA for putting pride above friendship.

I understand why it would feel wrong to rate a friends book dishonestly based on your own personal metrics.  \n\nHowever, if you didn't know, a lot of new books need as many five-star early ratings as they can to get attention and take off.  Now you know.  In this case, is perfect honesty preferable to withholding something that could help your friend out immensely?  That's a decision you are making, and I think there is an argument to be made that withholding that for a white lie that doesn't actually harm anyone is a bit AHish.\n\nYour friends probably assumed you knew all this, and maybe you didn't.

A few years from now, once the novel is no longer new, and the initial ratings won't impact it as much, you can change it back to four and get your accuracy back.  Right now is a critical time for the sales of this book, and you are in a position to help your friend a lot.

It's impossible for every book to be 5 stars. If 5 out of 5 stars represents the best in category, then logically, every book rated cannot be 5 stars. Most are 3.

From your friends perspective, they're looking for support from you right now, not hard truths that rain on their parade.

Deciding to prioritize rigid, arbitrary standards over the friendship is something people notice and many won't forgive you for.\n\nHaving said that, their behavior isn't great either. I get exactly where they're coming from and why they feel hurt about it but in the end if you ask people for reviews you're going to get reviews and realistically they're not all going to be 5 stars. Trying to game the system by demanding 5 star reviews is tacky and borders on dishonesty. Also, the overall total number of reviews helps them and scoring in the 80-100% range is still going to help sales.

If you value the friendship, you have to give the requested 5 stars.  OTOH, I would never treat an old friend like they are treating you right now.  If one of my friends tried this kind of emotional blackmail with me, I would cut my losses and move on. A glowing 4 star review of a book on Amazon is a good review.

Plus clearly I'm not trying to sell anything, just keep a private record of what I liked. I'm sure I'd have to have a whole different consideration of ethics if I were involved in the book trade as a reviewer, interesting...but I still think any private reader should be allowed an honest opinion. \n\n@jennnjennjen (cool username!), your final idea for a blog post is good!

What leads up to me even knowing such a bad book's name? How did such a bad book make it into my home? As such one star is simply not something I could give.\n\nNow two stars? I could imagine having one of those. Those are the books I don't finish. The books that can't hold my attention that get cast aside and forgotten about.\n\nSo what is three stars? A book I enjoyed enough to finish but not recommend? Is that the average book I've read? I don't think so. I have read books like that so they get 3 stars.\n\nFour stars must then be the books I have read and would recommend when asked. Well that is most books! I usually enjoy books I pick out because I've gotten quite good at picking out books I will enjoy. So on average my reviews will end up being 4-stars.\n\nFive stars then must be those books I will advocate for. Those books I will promote unprompted. Those books that I finish and quickly rush to group chats to rave about. The books that give me nightmares (House of Leaves), the books that change my world (Small Gods). We've all had those books that change us. Those books are five stars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo no, I think the average book being 4-stars/5-stars isn't abnormal at all.

There are way too many books published each year for an author to count on the algorithm just magically \"surfacing\" a book, and if you actually know the title and author, an Amazon search will bring it up even with a low rating (not that 4 stars is low).

If your friend wants her book to show up more prominently, the solution is to give Amazon money, not to solicit artificially high ratings from friends.\n\nGetting someone to read or buy a book is a two-step process: the potential reader has to find out about the book's existence, and then they have to see enough convincing evidence to make them actually want to read it. A detailed and positive four-star review is a valuable contribution to the second step, more so than a questionable five-star rating.", "If you thought it was a four then it was a four.

Maybe they think they can bully you because you are their friend, but if they do this kind of thing to others, they will find themselves in a world of trouble. Harassing reviewers to change or inflate their ratings on Amazon or Goodreads has had several authors cancelled and tanked their careers.

It\u2019s set up for a lot of items, and books largely work as a loss leader for the website.\n\nIt\u2019s confusing and I don\u2019t blame readers for not understanding it. But if a friend, especially someone I\u2019d explained this to, rated lower than 5 stars? It\u2019d be a faux pas at best, and maybe even actively hurtful depending on how much I\u2019d said, how close we were, and other related factors, even if technically they weren\u2019t being unethical.\n\nOTOH, your friend is probably under *immense* pressure for that book to perform well, especially if it\u2019s tradpub with blurbs from big names. They\u2019re probably watching that star rating and watching their numbers and hoping they\u2019re able to justify their advance enough to the publisher to secure another contract. Stumbling onto a review from a friend that jeopardizes that (or feels like it might)? That\u2019s rough.\n\nThey still shouldn\u2019t have reacted the way they did to you; I do think going through more of an explanation of why that distinction matters and gently asking for it to be removed or adjusted would have been better, if they were going to say anything at all.

Still, given that they\u2019re a friend of multiple decades and they did so privately, it feels reasonable to give them a little more wiggle room on it since this isn\u2019t an author/reader relationship, it\u2019s a friend/friend relationship first and foremost.", "*I gave the novel a 4-star ranking, a detailed and praise-laden review, with no negative commentary, nor any caveats on why I withheld the fifth star.*\n\nIf I understood that correctly, since English isn\u00b4t my mother tongue, you gave the book 4 stars without explaining why you deducted one star?\n\nIf that is correct, then yea, YTA.

If you feel a 5 star isn't deserved, then just don't  leave one, or wait 6 months or until your review won't have a huge impact. \n\nGoodreads is less critical IMO.

But a detailed four star review would catch my eye. Hell, a detailed one star review would catch my eye and potentially have me give it a chance.\n\nThat being said, the only reason I would possibly say that you're the AH is because I feel like it would have been best practice (only because it's your friend) to inform them up front ahead of time that they aren't guaranteed five stars just because you're friends. I say this because I had to turn down editing and refuse reviewing a book one of my aunts wrote because there was no way I could give it five stars. (But for the first several weeks, the only reviews on that book were family/friend reviews and they were all five stars.)\n\nYour friends, however, had absolutely no right to demand five stars and should be ashamed for even thinking to ask. The point of ARCs (assuming they provided the book) and reviews (whether the book was provided or not) is to get HONEST thoughts about what people liked about a book.\n\nI'm really lax with my ratings. If I loved the book, would read it again, would read the next in the series, or read more from that author, it pretty much gets five stars. But I also appreciate the more nuanced ratings, which I used to do.\n\nI can't recall if you can do it on Amazon, but I'm pretty sure you can post a review without a star rating in Goodreads if you were to decide to repost the review and just leave the stars off.\n\nBut with their behavior, they kind of don't deserve your good review!", "Meh, if she only wants 5 stars, she should do like most of people and buy them as well as followers. /s\n\nI am an artist and i will tell you, you can\u2019t do it in any artistic career if you are thin skinned.

In reality, 4.2 looks like a buyer beware situation comparatively. \n\nThe same applies to books.

You can still be completely honest in your review AND be helpful to your friend.\n\nMy advice is, put the 5 stars in Amazon, remembering the rating is for how much you recommend buying the book. If your review is 100% positive, then this is not untrue.\n\nIt seems you are saving the last star for a subjective part of your reviews, like saying \"this is perfect but it's not my trope\", because you talk about passion. So if that's a subjective part, talk with your friend with the same honesty he talked to you asking for the 5 stars. Just put the 5 stars to help and then tell him in person what do you think he could improve in his next book, if not, then your reviews are not helpful at all because there is only a subjective opinion that the book is not a 5 stars and the writer would never get the chance to improve and become a better author.", "NTA.", "NTA.

Amazon, on the other hand, doesn't have a system in place to tell you what the star ratings mean.

But he shouldn't be expected to lie and put his own reputation on the line.\n\nI've been asked to leave reviews under my personal name for friends before and told them no - they can pay for fake reviews like everyone else if that's what they want.", "I find Goodreads star cultures is actually quite different from other websites though. A lot of people reserve 5 stars for their absolute favorites. I even see 3 star reviews on good reads that are exclusively positive.\n\nThat being said, you\u2019re totally right about Amazon. I\u2019ve seen people give totally defective products 4 stars there.", "4 is a high goodreads rating and a terrible Amazon rating, the two are substantially different.", "I am so sick and tired of these review websites because of apparently everyone in this thread who doesn't understand what you said here. Everyone is trying to sell something. Whether it's the book, their YouTube and various other social media via reviewing the book, their own book via their review, etc. It's driving me insane and it has led to a very skewed system where we have objectively horrible literature being given multiple stars and high praise just because people liked that the main lead was hot or something. Five stars means it's the best of the best. Not just that you liked it a lot. Liking something doesn't make it five star literature. I understand that this is all subjective, but it's gotten so bad that it actually isn't anymore. Poor grammar, misspelt words, bad formatting and plagiarism are objectively bad in literature and yet we have stories like Light Lark st 3+ stars right now despite having several of those issues.

None of the readers who actually engage with reviews would be happy to know this and we know it because this has happened before and the author is always the one who gets cancelled. If OP made this known, the book would go viral just from the outrage. I'm not saying OP should do that. I'm just pointing out how much the reviewers we're talking about would despise this.", "Imo the compromise here is to review the book five stars (because of Amazon and Goodreads' algorithmic reliance on them, especially in early stages, as mentioned) and to keep the written review as written, EXCEPT include a disclosure at the bottom of the review that the book was written by a personal friend. \n\nThis is the most fair to both the writer/friends (who, as mentioned, have invested enormously and at such an early review stage, need to protect the books placement in the algorithm) and the potential book readers. I suspect readers like yourself and other comments with a similar sentiment ARE actually reading the reviews, so you would see the disclaimer. But the algorithm that chooses what books to promote? It does not read more than the star rating.", "\u2014 tangent> I read all this \u201cThe algorithm made me do it\u201d talk (broadly, across a LOT of replies) and I start feeling like corporate America has made \u201cthe algorithm the new \u201cmanager\u201d at a used car dealership!\n\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s fucking you?

There are a lot of really good books that I read one time, am happy I did so, and then move on. Then there are really amazing books that I bring up again and again, that I buy special editions for, etc. But the current algorithms don't let you differentiate between those two levels without seriously hurting the \"really great but not a favorite\" book's sales and reach.", "I\u2019m not a critique but I have a goodreads account for my personal reading list. I only give 5 stars to books that absolutely blow my mind and I would read all over again. If I give 4 stars, it\u2019s still a really good book and I will recommend it to friends.

Goodreas probably as well. Few hundred redditors is not a representative sample.\n\nYou simply need to look at the Amazon data posted in other comment. If more people used a scale where 5 is very hard to reach, then it would not overwhelmingly dominate in review scores. But it does. 4 is behind with a huge margin. Which means that a stricter scale is not a prevalent way of thinking. It does not get any clearer than that.\n\nPeople are gaming the reviews, which has resulted in a shifted scale.

Like no sh*t I had room to improve, I was in grade school!", "Good answer and analogy. Those types of teachers are assholes, and so is OP", "To add to this from a publishing perspective, because it can seem a bit out there for the reactions; Amazon has a notoriously nebulous algorithm for showing books (I assume all items, but in this case I can only speak for books) to people unless they search the exact title. \n\nSo, let's say for example that OP's friends book was a thriller. Unless someone inputs the exact book title into the amazon search bar, whether someone sees the book when they search \"thriller book\" for example, will depend on amazon's algorithm. A good publisher will have a strong team behind it that makes sure keywords and metadata are relevant and help the chances, but a *big* part of that visibility is the star rating. We noticed that anything over 4.5 stars suddenly started getting a lot more traction from relevant but not specific searches.\n\nHow likely it is that a single 4-star review would bring down the overall average is another question, though one I severely doubt. And the requests could have been put forth in a much better way that didn't assume industry knowledge if OP is just a reviewer and not privy to behind the scenes of amazon mechanics.\n\nTLDR: the author friend isn't wrong that ratings on amazon matter a lot to sales, especially early days, *especially* if they're a debut author. It's not inconceivable that a 4 star review could pull the average down, but that would require pretty much every other review to be 5 stars.", "I am non ASD and I have to say this does annoy me.\n\nGreat local cafe with competent ordinary food?

I\u2019ve seen a lot of authors rant about losing their perfect rating. And honestly some reviews are down right mean and hurt to read, but they\u2019re not for me. \n\nI know if I look at reviews I\u2019m going to get my feelings hurt, but reading the lower star reviews of my early books helped me improve. My editors can give me feedback but it\u2019s not the same as reader feedback. Reading the reviews highlighted areas that had slipped through in the editing phases, and I was able to address them in the sequels. \n\nI only get annoyed (and that\u2019s too strong a word but my brain is failing at an alternative) when it\u2019s a 1 star or 2 star because they don\u2019t like specific elements, an example I had a 1 star because the reviewer doesn\u2019t like omegaverse.

So a 4 star rating on Amazon is really quite detrimental.", "That is the point of reviews, it is a spectrum of individual opinion.", "I mean there\u2019s got to be a line somewhere though, we\u2019re not just giving 5 star hands outs for good writing that lacks character, or okay writing with a great sun plot.\n\nWhen I browse good reads I\u2019ll read most books with a 3.6 or above. And many 4.2+ books I didn\u2019t like.\n\nFor me a 5 star books is one of two things. \n\n1. I see myself rereading it again one day, because it was very good.\n\n2.

So if I see any new piece of any art(video, book, music, video games) with flawless reviews I'm sketched out.  \n\n\nFor me 4,7-5 stars is a very good product. 3,9-4,7 - Average but still enjoyable and anything below that might be either hidden gem lost in the shuffle or just not good product.", "I feel the same way. 3 star reviews are the ones I trust to actually give useful and well considered feedback. People who just give 5s to everything don't help me make an informed opinion, and 1 star reviews are often pretty unhinged. It's the 3 and 4 star reviews that help me make a reasoned decision. I appreciate those of you who take the time to give a fair and accurate assessment that's not just \"this doesn't suck, 5 stars\""]}
