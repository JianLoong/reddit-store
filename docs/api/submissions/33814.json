You saved a lot of money, and your clothing probably looks AMAZING because it's tailored for you. Ignore them both and enjoy your better health and your fantastic wardrobe!", "NTA\n\nKudos to you for taking a  really sensible, resource saving approach.\n\nHaving the clothes tailored for you means they're likely to look great, another win.\n\nI have to give you a pass for what you called her in the circumstances. She attacked you completely out of left field. \n\nYou can't be expected to be a mind reader & know she needs the clothes. You aren't obliged to give them away in any case!", "NTA. You did what everyone should do -  try to use what you have without throwing it out and buying new items.", "NTA. They're your clothes, and the bride's sister was never entitled to them nor was anyone else.", "Easy nta. Good for you on conserving resources and reducing waste by retail orang your clothing !", "NTA. You don't owe her your clothes, but you also didn't need to call her a leech (even if she might have been acting like one).", "Definitely NTA. You don't owe anyone your old wardrobe. You are using your own clothes and it's ridiculous for her to feel like she's entitled to benefit from your weight loss.", "What the heck?? Um Nope! NTA!!\n\nIt is NOT your responsibility to clothe your cousin just because she has put on weight and you have lost weight.\n\nTalk about entitled!! \n\nI think you are 'richer' because you found a way NOT to go buy a whole new wardrobe, and instead tailor your clothing so you could continue using it.", "NTA. You don't owe your cousin free clothes. Not to mention there's nothing wrong with tailoring clothes you like so that they will still fit you.\n\nAlso, as a woman whose weight does tend to yo-yo, I also keep a few outfits in different sizes (that have fit me in the past), because I know this is an issue for me.", "Wtf how well do you even know this woman. Would she have even been your first thought for sending clothes to if you had donated them? They are your clothes. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA, it\u2019s smart to have your clothes tailored to fit the size you are now.  Also how were you supposed to know that she gained a lot of weight.  Regardless those clothes are yours and you aren\u2019t done with them.", "NTA. The only way you \"offended\" her was by not giving her free shit. Fuuuuuuuuck that", "NTA. They are YOUR clothes and you are choosing to adjust them to your size, and keep some in case your weight changes again. This is perfectly acceptable, reasonable, and intelligent thinking. And it's your right to do that anyway--you could keep them as-is in your closet and buy a new wardrobe and let them sit there, if you want. She wasn't and never will be entitled to your clothing! I'd have called her what you did as well.", "Nta. She\u2019s crazy. You owe her nothing.", "NTA at all. I keep a wide variety of sizes as well. She had no right to an opinion about your dress at all!", "Maybe not but I\u2019m sick of her and her mother constantly trying to get freebies from my family for decades \n\nAnd now she quite literally wants the clothes off of my back? When you\u2019re standing in a wedding that my dad has contributed the most to?\n\nI just think she has an awful lot of cheek and what I said in the moment was how I felt in the moment", "How is that a YTA?", "I think you have the wrong judgement then, since you're on OP's side?", "She is a leech, and while it was a very rude thing to say out loud, \"don't start none won't be none\" so I think you're in the clear.", "It's not. I mistyped and then edited.", "Thank you"]}
