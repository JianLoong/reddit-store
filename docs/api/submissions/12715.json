One was a lady getting out of her car trying to go into the home of a couple she took care of, the other was a friend driving home at night and a pack of hogs r\u00e0n across the road causing her to lose control of her truck and driving into a tree.

Use a proper enclosure just like you would for any other invasive critter. Ive lived by too many cat ladies who let their cats piss and shit everywhere and attack me and my pets on my own property and then weep when said asshole cat gets mauled or blended up in somebody's engine when it came on. My old truck was called the pussy slayer by my ex gf from all the cats that liked to sleep inside the engine compartment. I tried banging the hood before starting it, only sometimes worked. Made me so damn mad that people didn't care. \n\nIf you love your cat have it be indoors or build an enclosure. It's not hard. I've done it for my cats so they wouldn't get ate by the neighbors dogs.

There are some homes available for feral cats in our barns and barrel rooms. But once those homes are full, if the cats cannot be domesticated and adopted out as indoor cats, they are euthanized here too.\n\nThere are a couple of communities here where the feral cats are trapped, spayed/neutered, tagged with a microchip, and released back where they were found. That tends to happen more in the city/suburbs where the cats are living off of human trash rather than killing and eating birds and mice. That way the cats get to live out their lives but eventually the colony dies out.", "Taking him to a vet was just the best way, especially with a child here at the time.

They have discovered that killing the feral cats just opens the territory for other feral cats to move in.

Turns out native mammals are doing better where the dingoes are - because the dingoes are keeping the feral cats and foxes down. In the absence of dingoes sadly feral cats and foxes have to be controlled by other means.", "You did the right thing. I live in a small town in Alberta, Canada where cats ARE NOT allowed to run free. The town's bylaws state neither cats or dogs are allowed to roam free: pets need to stay confined to their yard or be on a leash when outdoors. Occasionally, we have minor disagreements with new residents when they move into town, but town hall explains the reasoning behind the bylaws. I, personally, have called the dog pound (a no kill organization) to pick up stray animals that have become nuisances.", "Yeah, my mum rescued a feral family a few years back and the kittens were all rehomed, but mum sadly couldn't be tamed.", "How are they not prey for all your large python species?", "Actually, trapping and killing does nothing to reduce the feral cat population because they breed much faster than they can be killed or otherwise removed from the population.\n\nTrap-neuter-return is actually much more effective in controlling feral cat populations.", "exactly - TNR", "City or suburban kids dont really learn about that stuff here unfortunatly. They just learn basic common sense stuff like dont fuck with spiders or dont go near a snake.", "I dont think it is at all.

It would also be very illegal to let them go.", "I don't think you understand, it's not the cats breeding that is a threat to local wildlife. It's the cats themselves, they are opportunistic hunters, meaning they will and do kill anything the can.

While our eco system relies on small mamals, birds and reptiles. Your animals are more evolved to deal with cats also since you have animals like coyotes and some big cats and even then feral cats are a problem there. So imagine it here where we have none of those things.", "I live in the US too and the big difference here is:\n\n**Wolves, eagles, bears, coyotes, and winter**\n\nAustralia does not have those predators either at all, or in the same numbers we do. Australia also doesn't freeze hard in the winter like big parts of the US do.\n\nThe TNR model works here because predators and weather make the colony go away faster. It does not work the same in Australia because they don't have the same ecosystem or predators.\n\nYou sound like the blathering loudmouth ignorant American stereotype right now. Just stop. You don't know what you are talking about and it is embarrassing.", "Will do mate."]}
