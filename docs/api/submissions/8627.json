We both have been putting efforts to limit our arguments for this exact fear of letting it spin out of control. The reasoning for these arguments is often misunderstanding what the other person usually said or thought. When we\u2019re not arguing, we\u2019re a pretty normal couple and do not have arguments on a daily basis. \n\nTimeline of the argument that\u2019s pushed us to at our tipping point:\nNov/Dec 2022: We had made plans to visit Europe in 2023, I had asked my parents if they wanted to join for a week as my Mom always wanted to see tulips in full bloom (My gift for her 50th Bday). Then we would split away from them and spend the next couple of weeks doing our things in Switzerland and Italy - something my wife wanted to do for sometime now. The things that were pending was gauging my parents interest in visiting Europe, my wife talking to her boss about the exact amount of time off she could take. \n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t as keen on visiting Europe and was having difficulty making up her mind, so I suggested we could either visit India our home country or do the Europe trip. She said she would prefer the former. So I suggested my wife that we would go to India for my the date of Bday, and either do the Europe trip earlier or following this detour, our first anniversary is in roughly the same period, so we could also celebrate in India with all our Family around. \n\nShe said she\u2019ll find a good time to talk to her boss about the vacation. \n\nJan 2023: We both had planned and were excited for a mini trip, but on the trip we had a discussion that turned into an argument and she blames me for ruining her mini vacation and based on our track record of ruined vacations so far, she doesn\u2019t want to go to Europe anymore. She blames me for not planning and not putting as much thought into our anniversary plans as much as I\u2019m doing for my moms bday. I said that wasn\u2019t the plan to celebrate with family around, she called it a stupid plan and she doesn\u2019t care for it and I should\u2019ve known that. I said if she doesn\u2019t want to do a family thing we could go to Europe, but she still holds the opinion that we won\u2019t have fun so we shouldn\u2019t go and that she doesn\u2019t want to come to India anymore if we\u2019re not doing Europe. \n\nToday: The argument of me not caring about our anniversary started from, me responding to a friends question of what would you do if she can\u2019t make it to India, since she still hasn\u2019t asked her boss about taking time off. To which I said, I\u2019ll visit india as I want to celebrate my mom\u2019s bday and I\u2019ll try to be back before our anniversary, but if it\u2019s not possible, it can\u2019t be helped. She asked me what do I care about more and I responded my moms bday more. She said she won\u2019t come to India just to spite me for giving this answer. \n\nI\u2019m unsure of what I can do at this point.

Which honestly to me sounds like you value your mom over your marriage. \n\nI bet this is not the first time you have chosen your mom over your wife, and hey you can keep doing that and eventually you will never have to choose again, bc your wife will be gone.", "YTA. If you love your wife, she takes priority over your mother. You don't seem to understand that. You love your mother more which is a contravention to your marital vows.", "Your priorities are clear, and I think YTA for expecting your wife not to be hurt by it. I am not surprised that you and your wife already have a difficult marriage. Frankly, unless you assign more importance to your relationship with your wife, I don\u2019t see it lasting much longer.", "Some people don\u2019t deserve to be married Like you OP when you come back from that \u201cMommy and Son\u201d trip don\u2019t be surprised when half of the house is gon and your wife has blocked you and there are divorce papers onna table.\n\nAlso y do you care about your moms bday more than your 1st anniversary like cmon man your mom alr had her 4 ten year milestones and she can go 1 year without you so jus go onna trip with your wife instead call your mom and say happy bday and then when you get back you and your mom can go somewhere.", "YTA \n\nYour wife is trying to make you see that you put your mother first. Your mother is important. Your mother is not more important than your wife. \n\nIt seems like you are more focused on your mother, a celebration of your mother, where she wants to vacation and you're basing all your plans on what your mother wants, not what your wife wants. Stop revolving your life around your mother. She hasn't asked for the time off because she doesn't want a vacation on those terms. \n\nWake up before you lose your wife.", "WTF did I just read? \n\nWhy did you two get married? Crap on a cracker!\n\nYou are trying to please too many people. If you still have a marriage after this debacle, hear me now: YOUR WIFE COMES FIRST.\n\nYou started planning your anniversary trip to where your wife wanted to go, then completely changed gears because your mom didn't want to go there? So WHAT? This is your trip with your wife!\n\nYour mother does not have to be in India on her exact birthday FFS. Take her another time.\n\nYTA, mamas boy.", "So, you have a wife, you know... someone you decided to spend the life with, voluntarily I will presume. You planed with your wife a trip that she wants to do, you put in the middle your mom but okay, I can understand that if you can accommodate both is fine.\n\nThen, because your mom does not want the trip that your wife wants for your anniversary (you now, special couple times for couples) she is accommodating enough to sacrifice for a smaller trip so your mother can be satisfied. Then, your final answer to all what happened is \"my mother comes first, my wife can suck it up\" if I cannot make it for both trips.\n\nOf course she is gonna be pissed!! You are clearly telling her that she is not that important for you; you don't care about what she wants. And you think the \"to spite you\" she does not want to go to India? Most likely I wouldn't want to go neither, to be reminded that I am a second dish in the relationship.\n\nFor me, YTA", "Dude, why did you even got married?\nYou should simply live with your mother.\n\nYTA", "YTA for two things. \n\n1) What you said in the second to last paragraph about missing your own anniversary and \n2) Making me read that unnecessarily long post just to find a clear cut \"AH moment\" right at the end.", "Your wife should come first...not your mom. \n\nAnd you let your wife know she's not.\n\nYTA", ">She asked me what do I care about more and I responded my moms bday more.\n\nYou just told your wife you love your mom more than her. Why are you even married?\n\nJust go have sex with your mom and be done with it.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You\u2019re allowing your moms wishy-washiness to dictate your wife\u2019s vacation. The last part sealed the nail in the AH coffin. I hope your wife is able to read your post so she knows who she\u2019s dealing with.", "YTA, come on man really? You don't see where the issue is?", "YTA.\n\nAnd start packing your bags. You just let your wife know where she lies on your priority scale, and if she is a smart woman she will file for divorce before having children with you.\n\nAnd man who puts his mother before his wife after marriage (for special events - not talking about right or wrong situations), is a man who will never put his children before his mother. \n\nAs an Indian woman myself, you scream full blown mama boy.", "YTA You and your wife made plans to visit Europe and then you invited your mother into it and then it all changed to be about what your mother wanted. Well, we can all see what the issue is here. you are married to your wife, not your mother. Cut the apron strings.", "YTA, but not on purpose.\n\nOne of my kids just got married. They were sweating out spending Christmas with us, and with the in-laws (there were some big complications, including a Covid infection in one of the households). My kid was very worried about pleasing me/our family. \n\nI told them they were wrong. Their first obligation was now to their spouse. Your first obligation is now to your spouse. Your spouse is the person with whom you need to consult on your ideas and plans, before you take it to your mother. Your spouse is the person you are building a family with (whether or not you have or plan to have children, you and your spouse are now becoming a family together).\n\nIt's going to take you a while to get used to this (hopefully, it will take your mother less time, but if it takes her more time, that is her problem, not yours).\n\nTell your mom you have to work out your plans with your spouse first, and then you'll get back to her. Apologize to your spouse. Tell her you're still working out the kinks of being married, and you want to do something for your anniversary, and for your mom's birthday, and that you'd like to figure out the anniversary plans first.\n\nGood luck! That first year of marriage is full of landmines. You'll get through. Honor your marriage first, and you'll probably even get through it with all your limbs.", "YTA! A big one!", "ESH\n\nYour wife needs to stop with the tantruming but dude.  Seriously?\n\n\"I told my wife that I care about my mom's birthday more than our anniversary.  If I get back in time, great  - but if not, it can't be helped\"\n\nIt absolutely COULD be helped - You're just proving to your wife that she will forever come behind your mother.  Your marriage will forever come second place to your mother.  I'd bet my bottom dollar that your wife is currently reevaluating this marriage entirely right now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
