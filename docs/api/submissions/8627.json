We both have been putting efforts to limit our arguments for this exact fear of letting it spin out of control. The reasoning for these arguments is often misunderstanding what the other person usually said or thought. When we\u2019re not arguing, we\u2019re a pretty normal couple and do not have arguments on a daily basis. \n\nTimeline of the argument that\u2019s pushed us to at our tipping point:\nNov/Dec 2022: We had made plans to visit Europe in 2023, I had asked my parents if they wanted to join for a week as my Mom always wanted to see tulips in full bloom (My gift for her 50th Bday). Then we would split away from them and spend the next couple of weeks doing our things in Switzerland and Italy - something my wife wanted to do for sometime now. The things that were pending was gauging my parents interest in visiting Europe, my wife talking to her boss about the exact amount of time off she could take. \n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t as keen on visiting Europe and was having difficulty making up her mind, so I suggested we could either visit India our home country or do the Europe trip. She said she would prefer the former. So I suggested my wife that we would go to India for my the date of Bday, and either do the Europe trip earlier or following this detour, our first anniversary is in roughly the same period, so we could also celebrate in India with all our Family around. \n\nShe said she\u2019ll find a good time to talk to her boss about the vacation. \n\nJan 2023: We both had planned and were excited for a mini trip, but on the trip we had a discussion that turned into an argument and she blames me for ruining her mini vacation and based on our track record of ruined vacations so far, she doesn\u2019t want to go to Europe anymore. She blames me for not planning and not putting as much thought into our anniversary plans as much as I\u2019m doing for my moms bday. I said that wasn\u2019t the plan to celebrate with family around, she called it a stupid plan and she doesn\u2019t care for it and I should\u2019ve known that. I said if she doesn\u2019t want to do a family thing we could go to Europe, but she still holds the opinion that we won\u2019t have fun so we shouldn\u2019t go and that she doesn\u2019t want to come to India anymore if we\u2019re not doing Europe. \n\nToday: The argument of me not caring about our anniversary started from, me responding to a friends question of what would you do if she can\u2019t make it to India, since she still hasn\u2019t asked her boss about taking time off. To which I said, I\u2019ll visit india as I want to celebrate my mom\u2019s bday and I\u2019ll try to be back before our anniversary, but if it\u2019s not possible, it can\u2019t be helped. She asked me what do I care about more and I responded my moms bday more. She said she won\u2019t come to India just to spite me for giving this answer. \n\nI\u2019m unsure of what I can do at this point.

They were sweating out spending Christmas with us, and with the in-laws (there were some big complications, including a Covid infection in one of the households). My kid was very worried about pleasing me/our family. \n\nI told them they were wrong. Their first obligation was now to their spouse. Your first obligation is now to your spouse. Your spouse is the person with whom you need to consult on your ideas and plans, before you take it to your mother. Your spouse is the person you are building a family with (whether or not you have or plan to have children, you and your spouse are now becoming a family together).\n\nIt's going to take you a while to get used to this (hopefully, it will take your mother less time, but if it takes her more time, that is her problem, not yours).\n\nTell your mom you have to work out your plans with your spouse first, and then you'll get back to her. Apologize to your spouse. Tell her you're still working out the kinks of being married, and you want to do something for your anniversary, and for your mom's birthday, and that you'd like to figure out the anniversary plans first.\n\nGood luck! That first year of marriage is full of landmines. You'll get through. Honor your marriage first, and you'll probably even get through it with all your limbs.", "YTA!

If I get back in time, great  - but if not, it can't be helped\"\n\nIt absolutely COULD be helped - You're just proving to your wife that she will forever come behind your mother.
