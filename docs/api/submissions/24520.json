If I had to choose between your food preferences and your girlfriend's, I'd choose yours in a heartbeat.\n\n**But she likes what she likes.** You are unlikely to get her to change, and trying to get her to change is just causing friction in your relationship.\n\n**So stop trying.** Stop trying to cook things you think she'll eat, because she'll find a reason to criticize it, and then you'll just feel unappreciated and resentful.\n\nLet her fend for herself. You can cook for yourself, and occasionally invite your friends around to eat your cooking. But leave her out of it. Your food preferences are incompatible, and there's no reason why you should spend the rest of your life cooking the hot dogs and the mac 'n' cheese she likes, because that will just make you unhappy.\n\nIf she then protests that you never make anything for her, you can say \"We tried that, but you don't like my cooking\".", "YTA for asking her what **she** wants and deciding that she's wrong.", "INFO: Can you give the two recipes for comparison?\n\nIf it was the same recipe but with different sources of ingredients, then N T A\n\nBut if you really did change the recipe, then Y T A, because you cooked a different meal than you said you would.", "YTA for asking what she wants, her giving you exact instructions for what she wants, and then disregarding them.

You would not be TA for doing that, you are not obligated to cook for her.\n\nYou have to understand though, sometimes I want foodcourt Chinese food and I'd be pissed if someone said they would get me that but instead got authentic, even Michelin star Chinese food. Sometimes I want pasta with hotdogs in it and not real Italian Nonna's recipe. You don't have to make her what she wants, but don't say you will and then don't. Yes, you're the bad guy for trying to cook real fresh food if she's already told you she doesn't want to eat real fresh food and you've already promised to make what she wants but then decided to make real fresh food instead without telling her. \n\nIt's not about food at all - it's about one person promising to do something for another person, and then doing something different because they think they know better.", "NAH but i couldn\u2019t date someone like this. cooking separately all the time is a dealbreaker.", "YTA.  You are free to decide that you don\u2019t feel like cooking, but if she\u2019s asking for a specific recipe, it\u2019s because she wants that recipe, not whatever you decide to cook instead.  She is tired of being judged by you for having different food preferences.", "A light ESH. You ought to be a little more accommodating and less judgmental. It\u2019s not your job to police what your GF eats. I also love cooking, and would probably have the same opinion as you about the weird casserole she wanted.

If you take the time to cook her a meal and she doesn\u2019t like it, she can be nicer about saying she appreciates what you did, but this food isn\u2019t for her.  \n  \nTBH it sounds like she has a strong food sensitivity, similar to some of my friends who are on the spectrum.  \n  \nEither way, my advice for the future is to cook what you like for yourself, and offer to cook enough for her if she wants, without pressuring her to say yes. Be open to eating different meals together at the same time. And, once in a while, cook her the food she likes, in just the way she likes it, without trying to \u201cimprove\u201d it in ways that would appeal to most people but not her.", "YTA \nIt\u2019s very kind that you want to cook for her but as someone with a complex (and hugely unhealthy) relationship with food I really hate it when people who are more of the foodie type force their preferences. \nThe way you have written this post makes it sound like you are looking down on her for her food preferences which is not ok.

You agreed to make what she wanted, and then didn\u2019t. If you don\u2019t want to cook what she wants, don\u2019t offer. Why does every meal have to be what you want? You\u2019re being a food snob. Your food choices are fine, for you. Stop trying to make her like what you like and try giving what she likes a try.

Let her have what she wants occasionally.\n\nEdit: The amount of comments suggesting still more ways that OP can attempt to fix his girlfriends diet, which he has been attempting to do with everything mentioned in this post, is surprising and weird. She didn\u2019t ask him to fix her diet, she didn\u2019t ask for his take on the way she eats or her preferences. He has decided it\u2019s \u201cwrong,\u201d and therefore he is justified in constantly providing judgements and suggestions to fix it. He\u2019s not a dietitian she hired, he\u2019s her partner. If he was a vegan trying to convert her every comment would condemn it. I am autistic and a picky and bland eater, I\u2019m no longer a child and I\u2019m not looking for help \u201cfixing\u201d my diet from a partner. I simply wouldn\u2019t tolerate running commentary on the way I eat and that\u2019s what OP is doing. He can\u2019t have a single meal to her preferences, she can\u2019t request a single thing (that he offered) without him providing his unsolicited input, that\u2019s the issue here. She *does* make food for herself instead, as she said about eating rice bowls every night. He offered, she requested, he told her (again) why the way she eats is wrong and how he could fix it.", "NTA.

It\u2019s still the same.", "This is only fair if he also needs to understand how she feels when he acts the way he has described himself acting. Also, I know it's the usual way to phrase things, but she cannot make him feel anything. He chooses how he feels in response to how he perceives her behavior, but the feelings are his own responsibility. Constantly belittling her preferences and refusing to ever cater to her requests is an ordeal for her. There is nothing wrong with him wanting to cook good food or wanting to expand her palette, but why would she put any effort into trying something new when she doesn't ever get to have him cater to her wants, not ever. \n\nFirst make the food she is requesting the way she asked for it. Then discuss the flavor profiles after the food is made to her taste, come to an agreement on trying the dish with one ingredient change. My suggestion would be 2nd time making it use  rotisserie chicken instead of canned( because canned chicken is just meh). Then if she likes it that way, then discuss an additional change to one ingredient, until they can find the maximum change she can still like. If the dish ends up being one he is comfortable eating, they can add it into regular rotation. Too many changes at once, and the recipe isn't what she wants, and now she won't consider trying it. It's worth the effort to make and eat a few things he doesn't like to show he respects her enough to start from her preferred recipe. If he is looking for a long term relationship, and if it encourages her to make an effort to try new things, what harm is there in eating a few meh meals, her preferences are not poison. \n\n They both have bad behavior here. He seems clueless that her feelings are just as valid as his. It's hard to want to make changes to the way you do anything when the approach your partner chooses to \"encourage\" change is to belittle what you are currently doing.

Her food is not poisonous, you could survive eating it a time or two in order to encourage change with respect for her preferences. If I was consistently told that I was wrong, and my partner knew better, I would dig my heels in on trying things their way because there is no respect for me in this approach.
