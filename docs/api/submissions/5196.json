The rental thing is less of a problem than the fact that you'd be spending money you clearly don't have on something you clearly don't need. The rental argument is a red herring.

One day she will have her horse but if you're the only one bringing in an income and you're struggling as it is she has no right to bring such an expensive animal into her care.

What will happen then? What about your landlord? Are they okay with this?\n\nIf she accepted a horse without consulting with you about it, she will leave you both struggling financially. You\u2019ll be on the hole in no time if you cannot afford this. You had both agreed with waiting on any livestock until you own your own property. What happened to that? She can\u2019t be itching for a horse *this badly*.\n\nI sincerely hope you both can stay afloat after this.

In the first place, regardless of whether rental property or not, she shouldn't have agreed to keep the horse if she isn't financially capable enough yet to fully pay for the expenses herself.

What if your next place doesn't have the room for the horse?", "NTA obviously. Acquiring a \"free\" horse and keeping it on a rental property when you cannot afford to care for it is a terrible idea and it'd be the hill I die on. But even if you could afford it, the landlord agreed to it, you have a barn and properly fenced acreage, and you had a clean vet check (usually \"free\" animals are free for a reason, so a clean vet check is unlikely)... nobody in the comments has yet pointed out that your wife clearly doesn't know enough about horses to have one on her property, for the mere fact that you are talking about ONE horse. A single animal. Horses are herd animals that should NEVER be alone. Do your neighbors have horses in close proximity that your single horse can see (visually) 24/7? Do you have a plan to acquire a second herd animal (a goat or donkey, for example) to keep the horse company? Horses become depressed and develop problems when left alone. Humans, cats, dogs do not count because those are all predators. Prey animals need company to feel safe. Suggesting that you keep a single horse is incredibly ignorant at best, a death sentence at worst, and abusive always.", "Lemme just pick out the salient points here:\n\n> a year ago, we both had agreed we didn't want any live stock until we onwed property\n\nSmart\n\n> \"someone offered her a horse for free, and she's already accepted because she can't be happy without one\"\n\n\"She can't be happy without one\" is a line she's done a good job putting into your head btw. I would also not be 100% sure she got that horse for free. \n\n> She is a full-time student and works part-time when she can.\n\nAh, so financially dependent on you?\n\nSo, you made an agreement, based on your incomes, not to get a horse, which is purely a hobby cost.\n\nShe went behind your back and got one anyway, and is now dependent on you to pay for the horses upkeep?", "NTA. The horse issue has been well covered.\n\nBut seriously, look at your finances. If you're not making all the bills and she sometimes works part time, you are not setting yourself up for property ownership. It is not smart to have a car payment on an expensive truck especially with gas still high. You say you're using it for its intended purpose but if you both have big expensive indulgences, then you both need to come to a place where you either live within your means or forgive each other the indulgence. If you want to stay happily married, then you both need to come to agreement and peace about these things.", "Horses are never truly free.  Feed and hay costs are through the roof right now and it will be an easy $500 the first time he decides to colic and you need an emergency vet visit.", "NTA\n\nHer drcision is purely an emotional one, not rational. One might hope she knows what a horse costs to care for, and it's a lot more than you can afford, we're talking payments on a Ferrari (pun intended) not a pickup. Maybe she truly has no clue what mom and dad spent on horses.\n\nIf they have half a grain of sense they will happily explain to her why not.", "NTA Way back in high school, When I wanted a horse and was begging my dad to get me one, he made me write a care plan for the horse, and a contract as well. I had to do some research to figure out how much it would cost to keep the horse \u2014 stable rental and food and vet bills \u2014 and write up the care that it needed and how I would provide it. It made me very aware of what I was doing. I suggest you do the same for your wife.", "NTA\n\nI volunteer with a horse rescue.  Most of the rescues are drowning right now.\n\nHay and feed costs have tripled or quadrupled (at least in our area). And that's if you can find hay. Some people I know are calling around everywhere and driving hours just to pick up a few bales.\n\nOn top of that, are you going to be able to pay vet bills? Farrier bills? Floating their teeth if they need it? So many people assume you can just put a horse in a pasture, and it will be fine, but they do require care that can be expensive. \n\nWe are increasingly seeing horses sold to kill pens because owners can no longer afford their care. These aren't even old, worn-out horses. Some have papers and excellent pedigrees, but because of the rising costs associated with their care, they are sold. Please don't take this horse unless you can provide the care it needs.", "NTA. Make her work full time and save for a home so later you can have a horse. The audacity of demanding you to take on a living expensive animal (horses are expensive hence the reason it\u2019s probably free) but she works \u201cpart time sometimes\u201d lmaooo nope", "NTA horses are expensive! Even if you got it for free they aren\u2019t free to keep.  She\u2019s an a-hole because as a student she cannot afford a horse and you two should llut your money to saving for your own property rather than blowing it on feed.  It\u2019s called delayed gratification.", "NTA- I live on a farm where my husband used to run a boarding business. We only board two senior horses now, but those horses cost their owner at LEAST several thousand dollars a year just for vet and dental care. And when thats not for any major medical emergencies- just what senior horses require. Not to mention that their food costs are several hundred dollars a month. Horses are a HUGE expense when they are healthy but will absolutely break your bank when they have medical problems. An expense this big needs to be a joint decision.", "Maybe the horse has medical issues that can get expensive.", "her reasoning is that of a spoiled 12 year old. wonder if she grew up wealthy...", "Are you a horsewoman with a job, or are you more like OP\u2019s wife? This comment is so yikes lmao", "Theres a reaaon horsegirls have a reputation for being psychos.", "Draft horses for logging tear up the ground less, there's still some use cases for that. Farming and ranching...a horse is basically a living ATV there.", "There are on occasion times when draft horses for logging are used because the impact of them on the surrounding terrain is far less damaging than getting machinery in - but I'm with you on the rest and I am a horse person. We don't NEED them anymore (certainly not in the west) but they're nice to have and that's a luxury OP can't afford.", "Just not where the giver can see...", "I grew up on a ranch/farm, and the \u201cfree\u201d animals we adopted were always way more work than the ones we raised from birth. \n\nIt\u2019s a way bigger emotional investment. It\u2019s unbelievably depressing to try and get a sad animal to just eat food and and do anything besides just sleeping all day."]}
