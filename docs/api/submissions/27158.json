So I will give you a soft YTA. it sounds to me like she is seeking contact with you by going shopping with you, and so on, because she feels like that is the only way for her to be with you. She probably wishes that you would put some effort into spending time with her. Don't just \"hang out\" with her, because you are both nearby and doing (practical) things together, but offer to do something that you actually plan out.

I think the issue is not that you don't spend enough time with your fourteen year old, I think the issue is you don't have a \"thing\" with her like you do with your other kids. You have specific shows and things you enjoy doing with them, but with your fourteen year old it sounds like you spend time just doing what they want but aren't really invested in what they like to do the same way you are with your other kids.\n\nYou should try and find an activity or a show you and your fourteen year old both enjoy and look forward to together. I also think a lot of people are reading over the part where you say you spend the same amount of time with the fourteen year old, but that it's \"broken up,\" or that she just goes with you when you got the store and stuff. This is still time together, but it's not really quality time. Sitting down and watching a show or spending time engaging in a hobby you both like is quality time. \n\nIt sounds like you have quality/special time with the older kids, but not with your fourteen year old. Honestly, this is something you should WANT to fix. She's telling you she doesn't feel as close to you as the other kids. Why aren't you bothered that she feels that way?

The behavior you mention about how she critisizes everything you do when you spend time together is highly unlikeable and something she should grow/learn out before she leaves the nest.", "A very gentle YTA. \n\nIt seems like your daughter wants more than anything to have a *shared hobby* with you, like you have with her siblings.  Maybe she\u2019s not communicating it well because you\u2019re hearing \u201cI want more time\u201d and feeling \u201cI already give you so much time!\u201d as a reaction, but the root problem is the shopping and daily togetherness isn\u2019t making her *feel special* as she perceives (whether or not true!) you are doing with her siblings.\n\nTwo suggestions:\nCan you jazz up an existing hobby (learn to sew together so you can alter your thrift store finds?) or start a new one (find a show you like to watch together? try a new restaurant just the two of you every couple weeks? get into a niche category of online videos and share them with each other for laughs)? It seems like you could certainly make the time and she would actually get more of what she wants in a way that works for you if you go this route.\n\nCan you create a visual representation of time spent together, like a big calendar on the front of the fridge? Your youngest may be placated only by seeing \u201cSew time for parent and 3!\u201d or \u201cblocked for parent and 3 to do something fun!\u201d in gel pen on paper, especially when she sees that up against her siblings, things are actually pretty equally and equitably balanced. \n\nYou sound like a great parent but invalidating your youngest feelings by insisting the time you already have should be enough will probably only alienate her from you as age ages into her teens.

It sounds like you're doing a pretty good job of trying to be fair with your time with your children but I don't think you should be dismissing your daughter's feelings here.

I imagine the time spent \u201cdoing something\u201d doesn\u2019t feel special in the same way having a show or game you could bond over - like your son. \n\n14 is a challenging time for a young girl, so it\u2019s not surprising she\u2019s feeling insecure.

My son and I had more shared interests, so it was easy to find things to do with him. My daughter one day absolutely lost it, and she\u2019s a reserved kid. She was sobbing and saying we don\u2019t have \u201cour thing\u201d like I did with my son (music). My first reaction was to point out things we did, but upon listening to her, she was right. We didn\u2019t have that special thing that just she and I talked about or did just the two of us. Anything we shared was more like common ground stuff that anyone could join in on.

She's old enough to plan things with mom when she's available", "As a parent with 2 kids it honestly just sounds like she sets aside time with the son simply because he's reached an age where he's busy/getting older and doesn't want to necessarily be around mom all that much. \n\nI have a 13 year old that's much the same way where I need her to sort of pencil me in her schedule because frankly I'm uncool. My 9 year old however is like the youngest and clings to me like I'm her life preserver. I do still make specific scheduled times for each of them so I do think OP should do that...but I don't think it was an intentional AH move.

I will watch one episode and then get up to go do other things and she gets mad.  It's honestly like I can't make her happy. \n\nI am waiting for tickets for Five nights at Freddy's movie to go on sale so just her and I can go (not the other 2) , because she really wants to go....

You are a mother who seems to take good care of your children. It seems that the youngest just wants to be with you 100% of the time and is jealous of the alone time with the other siblings which is fine, she's a hormonal teenager what do you expect?
