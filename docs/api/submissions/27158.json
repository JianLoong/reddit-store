So I will give you a soft YTA. it sounds to me like she is seeking contact with you by going shopping with you, and so on, because she feels like that is the only way for her to be with you. She probably wishes that you would put some effort into spending time with her. Don't just \"hang out\" with her, because you are both nearby and doing (practical) things together, but offer to do something that you actually plan out.

I think the issue is not that you don't spend enough time with your fourteen year old, I think the issue is you don't have a \"thing\" with her like you do with your other kids. You have specific shows and things you enjoy doing with them, but with your fourteen year old it sounds like you spend time just doing what they want but aren't really invested in what they like to do the same way you are with your other kids.\n\nYou should try and find an activity or a show you and your fourteen year old both enjoy and look forward to together. I also think a lot of people are reading over the part where you say you spend the same amount of time with the fourteen year old, but that it's \"broken up,\" or that she just goes with you when you got the store and stuff. This is still time together, but it's not really quality time. Sitting down and watching a show or spending time engaging in a hobby you both like is quality time. \n\nIt sounds like you have quality/special time with the older kids, but not with your fourteen year old. Honestly, this is something you should WANT to fix. She's telling you she doesn't feel as close to you as the other kids. Why aren't you bothered that she feels that way?

The behavior you mention about how she critisizes everything you do when you spend time together is highly unlikeable and something she should grow/learn out before she leaves the nest.", "A very gentle YTA. \n\nIt seems like your daughter wants more than anything to have a *shared hobby* with you, like you have with her siblings.  Maybe she\u2019s not communicating it well because you\u2019re hearing \u201cI want more time\u201d and feeling \u201cI already give you so much time!\u201d as a reaction, but the root problem is the shopping and daily togetherness isn\u2019t making her *feel special* as she perceives (whether or not true!) you are doing with her siblings.\n\nTwo suggestions:\nCan you jazz up an existing hobby (learn to sew together so you can alter your thrift store finds?) or start a new one (find a show you like to watch together? try a new restaurant just the two of you every couple weeks? get into a niche category of online videos and share them with each other for laughs)? It seems like you could certainly make the time and she would actually get more of what she wants in a way that works for you if you go this route.\n\nCan you create a visual representation of time spent together, like a big calendar on the front of the fridge? Your youngest may be placated only by seeing \u201cSew time for parent and 3!\u201d or \u201cblocked for parent and 3 to do something fun!\u201d in gel pen on paper, especially when she sees that up against her siblings, things are actually pretty equally and equitably balanced. \n\nYou sound like a great parent but invalidating your youngest feelings by insisting the time you already have should be enough will probably only alienate her from you as age ages into her teens.

It sounds like you're doing a pretty good job of trying to be fair with your time with your children but I don't think you should be dismissing your daughter's feelings here.

I imagine the time spent \u201cdoing something\u201d doesn\u2019t feel special in the same way having a show or game you could bond over - like your son. \n\n14 is a challenging time for a young girl, so it\u2019s not surprising she\u2019s feeling insecure.

My son and I had more shared interests, so it was easy to find things to do with him. My daughter one day absolutely lost it, and she\u2019s a reserved kid. She was sobbing and saying we don\u2019t have \u201cour thing\u201d like I did with my son (music). My first reaction was to point out things we did, but upon listening to her, she was right. We didn\u2019t have that special thing that just she and I talked about or did just the two of us. Anything we shared was more like common ground stuff that anyone could join in on.

And then tell her how much you love her.", "Yta just the way you describe your youngest vs your son does give me the impression you do favor your son", "Excuse my assumption then. And yeah I think it does make a difference for the kids.", "I don't care about you. I read to many sexist parents to not think this is a valid question \ud83d\ude18", ">So I will talk to her and see exactly what she is wanting\n\nThat is really all you can do - make sure she has opportunity to voice her concerns.\n\nI reacted to feelings I got from your text, I truly felt a difference in how each one landed.  None of us are perfect as parents - but you looked for feedback, and I hope you can find a good path forward.", "They think your a man. Its auto YTA dont even bother trying to explain that some kids are just jealous. When i was younger around her age i too thought my parents didnt spend enough time with me when it wasnt true.\n\nIts probably just teenager things.", "In the older daughter's defense, she is probably working, wanting to spend time with friends/the person she's dating, has more school work. She's old enough to plan things with mom when she's available", "As a parent with 2 kids it honestly just sounds like she sets aside time with the son simply because he's reached an age where he's busy/getting older and doesn't want to necessarily be around mom all that much. \n\nI have a 13 year old that's much the same way where I need her to sort of pencil me in her schedule because frankly I'm uncool. My 9 year old however is like the youngest and clings to me like I'm her life preserver. I do still make specific scheduled times for each of them so I do think OP should do that...but I don't think it was an intentional AH move. Just an oversight that specific scheduled hang outs can be felt more special than just every day life.", "I accept I am TA. \n\nI don't favor my son in the sense I like him better. I just have more in common with him with my interests.\n\nHe also doesn't get mad, like my 14 year old when I play the game wrong.  She gets annoyed when I am not playing it exactly as it should be played, or if I magically beat her at a game she is good at. \n\nI steal my sons Pikmin and run away or button mash B with Roy on smash brothers.... He knows I am not going to win anything... It's to spend time together. \n\nI will play games with her too but she yells if I win, she yells that am not playing right etc. I will watch shows with her, but the shows she wants are like 30 min long... I will watch one episode and then get up to go do other things and she gets mad.  It's honestly like I can't make her happy. \n\nI am waiting for tickets for Five nights at Freddy's movie to go on sale so just her and I can go (not the other 2) , because she really wants to go.... Do I want to see this movie, no not really... But we are going to the first showing and having dinner in the theatre. I do try with her..... We just clash with the way we are and things we like.", "The mom should be taking her daughter out. Things shouldn\u2019t happen only when the daughter sets everything up and takes her mom out.", "Your explanation just makes it worse because at least before it seemed like subconscious act but now it\u2019s clear that you knew you were in the wrong but still came to post here", "NTA. This comment section is delusional. People are not perfect. Just work on finding your own special thing for the two of you and the rest will work itself out.", "The daughter knows her own schedule better and it's probably much easier for her to say \"Hey mom, I am completely free on Saturday night, let's grab dinner somewhere.\""]}
