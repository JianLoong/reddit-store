There was Princess, Empress, Prince, Prynz, Mi'Angel, and A'God. OP is def within his rights to not want to name his daughter that, but it's a way more common name than people think, and there are worse out there.", "My wife had a coworker named Princess. She was born and raised in America.\n\nShe asked her about how it was and yeah, she got all kinds of shit growing up, apparently in high school it got turned into some really gross sexual stuff. She tried going by yer middle name when she went to a new school but all it took was one teacher accidentally saying it and it started right back again.", "Wow. Apparently MJ wasn\u2019t a very creative namer. Lol", "I had a Filipino client named Cinderella. \n\nMy friend told me she had an Asian client who named her son Bill Clinton lol I always laugh when I think of that poor kid.", "EPIC! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4d", "I say this as a goodbye to my kids all the time \ud83d\ude02", "Think it\u2019ll work? Not a chance.", "That is very interesting, I\u2019m not sure which of these were legal names or if any were nicknames, but these were the names they chose to use in their professional lives.\n\nActually, in Girl\u2019s case specifically I think that was indeed her legal name (I don\u2019t know if it was her name at birth though or she assumed it when she came to Canada). She was a customer at a store I managed at the time, and she applied for one of our private label credit cards which required her to provide ID and was subject to a credit check. Her legal name absolutely was Girl.", "Oof. I knew a Cindyrella, and a RhellyJean. I\u2019m not going to criticize cultural names, but those names are kind of a lot.", "This has no right being so funny", "Yeah, I get why people do it. But as someone who has worked for a staffing company for 25+ years, it has to be removed before it can be submitted anywhere. You also need to keep in mind when the resume is copied or scanned, the pictures do not always come out looking like an actual human (just blurry blobs). Sometimes the pictures are just plain weird. \n\nAnd then you have to factor in some people/places will pick someone based on how they will \u201cfit in\u201d instead of picking the most qualified.

He was a cool old guy.

Neither lived up to their name.", "^(Psst. I think you mean translation - transliteration would be rewriting a name to sound the same with Latin characters.)", "Names really are a big thing for BOTH parents. They both would like their heritage recognized in their childrens' names. It's selfish, after having the choice of first name, to literally expect to get middle name as well. I say NTA! As a counter offer, I suggest Spike as the baby's middle name. That'll get Mommi being a little more negotiable.", "My son\u2019s last name is King. We had such fun thinking of first names! Mister and Doctor were the top two contenders, but so many possibilities! We went with Connor, lol", "My friend's parents moved from the Philippines to Canada.\n\nParents barely spoke any English when they arrived here.\n\nMy friend was born in Canada not long after her parents moved here.\n\nDoctor looks at the newborn baby and says \"Aw, isn't she such a cutie?\"\n\nParents (who, at this point, are still learning English) think the doctor is giving a name suggestion, and my friend gets named Cutie.", "I agree with that too. It is about how kids are raised. But it somehow feels much worse to be teased by your name than by a derivative of it. I had a boss who used to do something I later realized was a microagression (at the time it just felt like he was poking my insides with a screwdriver: he\u2019d say my name but with a very heavy Russian accent (I\u2019m Balkan so I can only guess what the douchebag must have been thinking) which made him sound like he was vomiting. It was so much worse than any of the derivatives of my name people would come up with.", "Kong would have been good.", "That\u2019s actually very sweet!", "I went to college with a Sirr. I can\u2019t say for when he was younger but no one made fun of him on college.

Problem solved.", "Colleen is actually the anglicised version of the name/word, the proper word in Irish is Cail\u00edn (same pronunciation)", "Yes.  Because they think it makes their kid sound majestic.  Someone who should be revered, someone who others will look up to.\nIt doesn't.  Not in American culture.

It means Princess just as much as the English name. And there are names like it across cultures. So it\u2019s not without extensive precedent.", "Isn't that also why Mr. T insisted on his name being that way?

Dennis?\n\nThanks, Princess....\n\nI can only hope I'd remember to mute before cracking up.", "I know of a girl who named her baby \"Sire\". Apparently they meant it as a way to adress kings, she was quite proud. I could only think of a male horse siring."]}
