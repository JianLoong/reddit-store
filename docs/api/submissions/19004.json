Let's just say that when Princess gets older she would likely change her name.

If you give your child a name like that, you should be prepared for her to resent it, and get rid of it the moment she's old enough.", "NTA. You both have to agree on a name it\u2019s not all about her. And yes Princess is a terrible name your child would hate hate you for it.", "Please do not name your daughter Princess.

My s-i-l once had a massive crying, sobbing meltdown over a McD's burger, threatened to leave my brother over it, even started packing her bags, scream crying the entire time. But she was 8 months pregnant. Pregnant women get very emotional over a lot of things. And irrational. That's not sexist. It's true. They will cry over cat food commercials, baby rabbits and parking the car. When she's no longer pregnant and no longer emotional, she's going to regret this, too. \n\nPlease stop her from making a decision under hormonal circumstances you will all (wife, you, child) regret for the rest of your lives. \n\nAna is a lovely name.

But then days later \"casually\" in conversation that she's happy you are good with her having her mother's middle name. I'm pretty sure if she had specified that in the first conversation you would have vetoed it. Now, she's trying to make you feel guilty for disagreeing with the name, when she never actually told you it would be Princess. Your wife is too old to be playing these games. If she's set on the name, it can be a middle name just like grandma and not a first name.", "She will be bullied AND easily creeped on by older dude she works with, any creepy teachers, any random stranger that approaches her trying to hit on her, girls will assume she\u2019s snobby, please don\u2019t back down.", "NTA, name your child Ana.
