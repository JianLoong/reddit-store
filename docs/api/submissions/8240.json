People who spend expected inheritances,  I have no words.  If your grandparents get ill, or have demen, or need round the clock care.

Finally, realize that even if you did give up some of the money out of guilt, etc - it will get wasted (from what you say here).  If anything, maybe suggest your grandparents put token amounts back for each of your half siblings; like 10k or 20k each that goes to them at a certain age;  25 or something....

People should not plan their lives on inheritance and they deserve what's coming for being irresponsible with their money.", "NTA. It's not your fault or your grandparents fault that they are spending money they don't have. It's not their money and it never was.

You're not the AH because you're only informed of their decision, you didn't influence it. \n\nHowever, you should talk to your grandparents about your concern wrt your mother's growing debt and lack of financial planning. They should be given an idea what (little) to expect to shape up as early as now. Tell your grandparents it will most likely destroy your relationship with your mother and family if they find out about the surprise mini-inheritance only when the gparents eventually pass away, either by hounding your for the money or guilting you for keeping it a secret all that time (or both). Ask for them to prepare your mother's expectations as early as now, and to consider providing something for the half-siblings even if just to cover and guarantee good education, via a strict trust.

Nothing. It's their money. \n\nWhat if one of them needs to hire a carer later in life? Is your mother going to talk them out of it, thinking of herself?

And there could be hospital/care bills between then and now - anything could happen.", "I do not know where the OP is from but where I reside, you inherit from your parents. Even if your parents wants their money to go elsewhere, it is legally impossible. That's what I meant but maybe it is different for her. \n\nIn any case, it is as you say. They should have taught their daughter. They did not. So it is natural that the money will disappear like a magic trick.
