I'm willing to bet that your FIL was a really, really bad one. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. At a young age children can\u2019t tell between reality and fantasy in their dreams. So when they have a bad dream about a monster in their room, saying \u201cit\u2019s not real\u201d doesn\u2019t change how they feel about it. It doesn\u2019t make them feel safer. Saying \u201cI\u2019ve dealt with it, I\u2019m here for you and your safe now\u201d makes them feel safer.", "NTA  Mary was upset by the 'monster' so you quite correctly reprimanded it. I think that's a brilliant idea and you're doing a great job of being a dad. Your FIL needs to keep his views on to himself. It works for Mary and that's all that is important.", "You can also make monster repellent to spray around the room, under the bed and in the closet.\n\nYou take an empty spray bottle, \"fill\" it with the secret ingredients known only to parents, and then it's good to go \ud83d\ude09 then the story to the kid is that just because you or the kid can't see the spray, the monsters can smell it so they'll be afraid to enter the room \ud83d\ude01\n\nNTA OP", "> Mary is four! She's allowed to ask her parents for protection against monsters and her parents are allowed to come up with sweet ways to make her feel safe.\n\nKids remember things like this too. When she gets older and she thinks back to times she asked her parents for help, even when she knows monsters aren't real, she'll remember that no matter how \"silly\" her fears are, her dad's got her back when she needs him.", "A spray bottle filled with \" magic monster spray\"  (water) that they can spray the monster with to make it go away works too. Just PLEASE don't make my mistake and put glitter in it!!! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "We used a combination of anti-monster spray (one of those scented sleep sprays with lavender, etc) and telling them that our cats hunt and eat monsters during the night. This was helped by the cats having night time zoomies and sleeping outside the kids rooms as if lying in wait for monsters.", "NTA! I have a 3 year old son and I made \"Monster Spray,\" and constantly scare the monsters away. It's normal! Your FIL was out of line.", "NTA.

My dad told me stuffies protect children in their dreams, and that so long as I slept with at least one stuffie, the nightmares would stop. My daddy never once lied to me growing up. \n\nI am 35 and dad died a few months ago. I still sleep with a stuffie, and the times I wake up from a nightmare, I find that my stuffie fell on the floor.", "There's another great book called \"There's a monster in your book\" where you try to get rid of the monster with tickling, blow it away it, shake the book etc. My daughter loves it!", "Honestly what 36 year old dude wants to marry a 50 year old and have a kid with her. Feels so weird.", "You can also get a spray bottle and label it 'monster repellant'\n\nWhen the kid gets scared, give under the bed a couple of squirts to get rid of the monsters!", "I thought you were going to say you got them to watch the Listen episode of Dr. Who...", "I will not be doing this with my little one, I am genuinely terrified of some of the doctor who monsters (weeping angels?).", "I did this for my youngest, I added some glitter to water in a fancy looking spray bottle. It got here to sleep in her room for a bit but she is now 15 and still sleeps on the sofa as much as she can. I don't know why she has never liked sleeping in her own room.", "There is also Little Monsters", "Made the same joke lol.", "This is so sweet. Sorry for your loss. Hope you're doing okay.", "Me too \ud83d\ude05 also reminds me on lines from Supernatural, when Sam said he always wanted to have normal childhood, parents to comfort him after nightmares and reassuring him there's no monster's and he shouldn't be afraid of the dark and then Dean goes, of course kids should be afraid of the dark - you Sam, you know what is out there \ud83d\ude05", "A quick Google search: \nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/01/health/colorscope-black-fear-of-darkness/index.html\n\"Through evolution, humans have therefore developed a tendency to be scared of darkness. \u201cIn the dark, our visual sense vanishes, and we are unable to detect who or what is around us.

It allows the child to take some control in keeping the monsters away.  That is such a great thing to do.  It gives the child the power to address their fears.", "My daughter (7) and I employ a Gruffalo (stuffed toy) to deal with any monster residents. Usually a talk suffices. Sometimes the whole cuddly crew has to go \u2018back to back\u2019 with her when she wants to get back to sleep. It definitely works better than trying to convince a child no monsters exist", "I did this one! My little one loved it, n I'll be using it for her Lil sis too.\n\nJust be sure to keep it out of reach.

Is it the room she is uncomfortable sleeping in or the bed?  Did she pick out her own mattress set within the last couple of years? Might be the couch just feels a lot better to sleep on.\n\nAnxiety of various types can also do that, (and of course it\u2019s common in young kids) but usually they want to sleep in a bed or room with a parent, not alone on a couch.  Unless the couch is very much closer to you than her room?\n\n(Did you ever live with somebody or have a guest once in a while who could have come into her room to hurt her at a very young age?
