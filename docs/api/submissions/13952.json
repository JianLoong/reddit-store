Parenting then, is not parenting now.", "NTA. She's 4, not 14. You and your wife are doing what's not only age appropriate, but what you should be doing. Giving Mary a sense of security, making her feel loved and protected. Kudos to you and your wife.", "NTA\n\nI go frequently on a monsterhunt for our 3yo. He joins in too. We grab the monsters and tell them to go down the stairs and leave through the mailbox (which is in the frontdoor, pretty standard in my country). Its all in good fun and what do you know, the day after they all took up shop in our house again.", "NTA", "NTA! I think it\u2019s sweet!\n\nHave you tried \u201cmonster spray\u201d?  Put some water in a clear spray bottle, make a cute label and put it by her bed at night. That way, if she gets scared, she can use the spray!\n\nEdit: word", "Definitely Nta I had a mom like that who made me feel safer while ALSO making me know the difference between fiction and fantasy. no child should \u201cfight their own bad dreams\u201d she\u2019s 4 for goodness sake", "0 out of 5. Any good parent would do the same thing! The Fil and Mil get 3 out of 5. To an extent he is right but he doesn't have any say to reprimand you. Your child had a nightmare and went to you for reassurance. You helped your child get back to sleep. That is the EXACT thing a good parent would do. Sure they may be the grandparents but that does NOT mean they have a say in how you raise your kids. My verdict, not the asshole", "Alright. Fine. I'll stop picking on Mary at night. Your inlaws however are done for.", "NTA.  I logically knew monsters weren't real but that didn't change the fear I experienced in the dark.  You're doing what's right for your daughter.\n\nYou can start having her participate in her own protection.  Over time it will help dispel the monsters.  My son and I would chant:\n\n>Boo!    \nShoo!  \nI'm not scared of you!\n\nHe also had a squirt bottle of monster repellent (water with one drop of an essential oil so it had a little smell to it to make it more convincing).\n\nOver time he started using his monster fighting tools on his own without prompting from me.  He was less likely to get up in the night.  Eventually he no longer needed them.", "NTA. I posted a writing prompt quite awhile ago that is basically this exact situation. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/kttz64/wp_your_daughter_is_afraid_of_the_dark_to_help/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "FIL is the asshole here, not you. Keep fighting for your boundaries. His old school ways are no longer valid. NTA", "When I was about 6, my dad somehow convinced me that the monster under my bed was actually my friend and he was there to protect me. This had the unintentional effect of me scaring the hell out of any friend who annoyed me by telling them that the monster would eat them.", "I do the exact same thing with my 5 year old son. During the day when he talks about monsters, I gently let him know they aren't real. When it's the middle of the night, dark and his wee sleep addled brain and body are scared, I scold the monsters under his bed. When his brain is in fight or flight he me telling him monsters aren't real won't make him feel better. In fact, it will make him lose his shit as he will think I don't believe him. What is wrong with people? Genuinely thinking small kids, still babies really, can process these things like adults. Makes me so sad for little ones.", "I used to threaten to sic the dog on the monster. Then have the dog lie down near the bed to keep watch. (It helped that she was a border collie and enjoyed participating in the ruse: looking under the bed and growling). Once kid was asleep, dog put herself back to bed.", "I made anti-monster spray for my kid at about the same age. Water + food coloring +lavender oil + glitter with a label that said Anti-Monster spray", "Exactly. Her parents are teaching her that she can come to them with any problems, and they'll not only believe her. But they'll help her, and not make her feel silly or stupid. That's a lesson that will take her far in life.", "I love that book. My parents sent my daughter the book with accompanying audio buttons and that's a favorite in our house. Mine hadn't struggled with monsters,  but she says giants hide in her room so we try to make sure she knows they are gentle giants.", "That's so cool! We use Monster Spray if my son is very adamant about monsters before going to bed. Works a treat before tucking him in.", "My mom used monster spray (water in a spray bottle i think)", "Ty. It helped a lot.", "\"Monsters aren't real, you're in no danger. Humans are naturally afraid of the dark but there is nothing there. Here's a nightlight\". That fucking simple. My friend tool his child to the wood to go camping, he said the woods are scary. She agreed with him. He developed a phobia of the woods. That's what playing into children's fear will do.", "We both know kids at this age are in a world of their own, a nightlight scares off the monsters, that\u2019s the logic their working on, they don\u2019t have the life experience to put understand the subconscious reasons as to why they fear the dark.\n\nKids learn eventually that there are no monsters under the bed, whether they consciously no longer believe monsters exist, or they think the monsters left, either way, one day their brains will click and no more monsters under the bed.\n\nWife said her mother did the same thing, the wife isn\u2019t afraid of monsters. It works.", "Except they explained why that was happening, it wasn\u2019t normally a weeping angel", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are right. Your FIL needs to stay out.", "NTA. I made a spray bottle of monster spray that my kid uses for the monsters under the bed.", "this reminds me of my childhood. when i was young, maybe 5, i would have nightmares and would go into my parents room and sleep in their bed. they didn\u2019t really like this and so, without ever talking to me about it, the next time that i had a nightmare and tried to leave my room to go to theirs, i found that my door was locked with one of this childproof things you put over the doorknob. i was so devastated and i felt so alone and like i couldn\u2019t confide in my parents or turn to them for comfort.\n\nyour child is still so young. keep letting her know that you\u2019re there for her and will protect her and that she can trust you. NTA", "NTA. When my five year old gets scared at night (it was more common at 4, but it still happens), she'll say, \"What if zombies come?\" and I say, \"We definitely don't have any zombies around here, they wouldn't dare.\" And she she says, \"But what if they do dare?\" And then I make her laugh by describing all the ways I would beat up and disable zombies. Generally ends with me throwing them in the ocean to be eaten by bottom feeders.", "NTA:\n\nMonsters are real, they're just usually people.  If anything, the lesson she's learning is to speak up.", "NTA", "When I told my Dad I was scared of the monster in my closet, he gave me a 45. JK it was a Nintendo NES controller gun.\n\nNTA. Sounds like your FIL is outta line.  Your Daughter is 4, there isn't a separation of fantasy and reality in her mind yet. So the monsters to her are very real. And if scolding the monster gives her peace, then by all means give the monster a time-out on the naughty spot.", "NTA! Mary's 4 and right now, monsters ARE real to her. If you wanted to try a different approach to the monster situation though, maybe you can try reframing it by telling Mary that the monsters aren't going to hurt her\u2014they want to be her friend, but they stay under the bed because they're shy. It could become part of her bedtime routine to say goodnight to the monsters :)", "NTA. FIL is the AH. A yuge AH. You keep scolding that badly behaved monster. FIL can keep his mouth shut.", "We took a can of air freshener and put a label on it for \"Monster Repellent\"\n\nNTA but this was about the most mild case I've ever seen on reddit.", "And don't forget the \"monster spray\" (water in a spray bottle with a little vanilla extract in it). \n\nYou spray that under the bed and around the closet doors to repel them. The vanilla extract gives it a vanilla scent so the kids know it's working. \n\nWe did this with both of our kids to scare the monsters away.", "After multiple rounds of \"honey, you know monsters aren't real\", my daughters were still scared of the monsters.  So one day when they said they were scared, I changed gears and firmly announced \"Mom is not scared of monsters.  Monsters are scared of Mom!!\".  And I stomped into that bedroom and loudly declared in my Angry Mom Voice that I'd had ENOUGH, and all monsters needed to leave immediately, or THERE WOULD BE CONSEQUENCES!\n\nI only had to tell the monsters off a few times before they stopped coming back, because monsters are scared of Mom!", "Only upvoting because it made me LOL", "Didn\u2019t you watch Monsters Inc.? Of course, they are real!", "Lol I love the bat. My mom used to spray \u201canti-witch spray\u201d on my pillow (after a particularaly gruelling reading of Roald Dahl\u2019s The Witches to a way too young me). It was lavender spray and it still is the most soothing scent to me.", "I find it fascinating the strategies parents are commenting they employ. I remember as a child my parents didn't do any of this stuff, but I found myself comforting my own fear of monsters by prescribing rules for how they work (think like the old \"If I'm completely under my blanket, the monsters can't get me\").\n\nAs I got older, into elementary school and such, my fear of supernatural monsters didn't really abate, which I don't think was great (though I eventually grew out of it): since I self-managed my fear of 'the monsters', my parents never really had to address it. But I would read books in the school library on various cultures' monster folklore, which, funny enough, also has a TON of rules that monsters obey. I found comfort in that. Monsters are so lawful. \n\nAnd now I'm a horror film junkie. Hehe.", "We had a sign on my daughter\u2019s door: \u201cNO MONSTERS ALLOWED BY ORDER OF THE MANAGEMENT.\u201d She kept it there for years, long after she stopped believing in monsters.\n\nShe was particularly fearful of bathroom monsters, so we put a hook and eye on the bathroom door so she could lock them out. You go with whatever works.", "My kid had Bitey Monster and Kissy Monster that lived in his room. Bitey monster was kind of rough around the edges and liked to nibble at his toes but was great at scaring bad guys away. Kissy monster was lovable and liked to give hugs and kisses before bed. Kiddo talked to both of them before bed and knew they\u2019d both be there watching over him while he slept. \n\nOf course he knew it was just mama doing the voices and nibbling his toes with my hands or giving kisses but it worked.", "I was 5 when Monsters, Inc. came out, so I think that\u2019s what helped me get over that fear, especially the end when they stop scaring kids and move to comedy.", "That makes complete sense!", "Absolutely recognised it and in fact was reading through the comments hoping someone had mentioned it. Susan is a wonderful character.", "Haha - I was just laughing with my daughter reading out your comment she said \u2018I used to think I was the only one!\u2019. Our spray was some version of poo-pourii, but we made a new label for it, might have been called \u2018Goblin be gone\u2019 or something like that. Lavender would have been nicer, but it only works on witches, not goblins.", "We have cats, so I told my children that the cats scare the monsters away.  Imagine how happy I was to see a scene in \u201cThe Mummy\u201d (the one with Brendan Fraiser) where the cat scares the mummy away.", "Because kids believe in magic! Older you get, less magic is in your life. And then reality kicks in\u2026", "She is. She's one of my favorites in that series.", "This whole conversation just reminds me of this beautiful artwork. I think it's been traveling the internet for some 15 years now. \n\nhttps://www.deviantart.com/begemott/art/sweet-halloween-dreams-42197587", "Oohhh add some lavender oil to it, everyone knows how monsters are repelled by it!", "I\u2019m 27, and I\u2019m still like this, though it was way more common when I was late teens. My freshman year of college, I don\u2019t remember ever sleeping in my own bed when I visited home. I was always with my mom or on my dad\u2019s futon (they were separated but still living together up until that June). And even after we moved, I still spent more nights on the couch or with my mom than in my own room."]}
