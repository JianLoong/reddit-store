She's allowed to ask her parents for protection against monsters and her parents are allowed to come up with sweet ways to make her feel safe.\n\nFIL had no reason to say anything.\n\nBTW, how you're dealing with the monsters sounds really sweet (I might steal this idea when my little one gets to that age).", "NTA. Any parent knows that you enter into a child's fantasies if you want to get anywhere with them. There's a wonderful line in a book about how a particular nanny used to beat the under-bed monsters with the fireplace poker. \"She could not convince the children not to believe in the monsters. The monsters were there. She could, however, get them to believe in the poker.\" \n\nWhen my kids were little, I collected every scary-looking stuffed animal I could find, from tigers and lobsters to Cthulhoid shoggoths. They were the Stuffy Army, and their job was to protect my kids from the monsters as soon as they got old enough to start worrying about monsters. We set them out about the room before bedtime so they'd be on watch. Worked a treat -- no monsters ever bothered my kids at night. \n\nYou're a parent, and it sounds like you're a good one. You know what's best for your kid. Don't let your FIL talk you out of it.", "NTA\n\nYou're being a awesome parent. Also: \n\n> \u201cit\u2019s time Mary learned how to fight her own bad dreams.\u201d\n\nShe's ***FOUR***. We're expecting four year olds to be emotionally mature enough to figure out that nightmares are a natural thing? NO! Coddle the kid and make her feel safe in her own damn bedroom", "I'm sorry to say I think the monster under the bed got to your father in law and now they are working together to try to keep you from keeping Mary safe from the monster........you most definitely are NTA you sound like a great dad keep doing what you do and ignore all others your father in law sounds like an idiot.", "NTA\n\nwe had a spray bottle with \"monster repellant\" .. worked a treat!\n\n Your in laws need to mind their business!", "NTA - FIL sounds like the kind of dad who'd take random things away from his kids, 'To teach them that life isn't fair.\" Whotta chud.", "NTA\n\nIts just a cute and funny way to handle a phase in your kids life. She\u2019ll eventually figure out that the monster isn\u2019t real, and it\u2019ll just be a funny memory she\u2019ll have and retell when she\u2019s older.", "NTA\n\nWas he suggestive or insistent? Not his place to tell you how to raise your child, especially of implying you're wrong, rather than making suggestions.\n\nHopefully your response was on the easy- going side.  I see his point,  but there should be a discussion between you about parenting suggestions in general to avoid confrontation.", "NTA. Now we know who the real monster is!", "NTA.\n\nShe's your daughter not his. He does not get to have an opinion. End of discussion.", "NTA \nthey\u2019re your kids. As an outsider looking in, that IS sweet. Your FIL isn\u2019t her parent. She\u2019s 4 years old. I didn\u2019t stop being afraid of the dark until I was at least 12, and I think I\u2019ve turned out okay haha.", "NTA. FIL can't say anything if his wife did the same things for your wife. Maybe he's going senile.", "NTA!!! \n\nYou\u2019re doing great. You\u2019re teaching Mary that she can come to you when she\u2019s scared, and you\u2019re showing her how to face her fears by confronting that bully monster. \n\nWhen she meets a real bully, she\u2019ll know to go to a trusted adult or to use her words to \u201cscold\u201d those IRL meanies. \n\nYour FIL is a grump. He spoke out of turn and owes you an apology, but don\u2019t expect one. \n\nGood job for sticking up for your family!", "NTA. You should read *Hogfather* by Terry Pratchett - the character Susan Sto Helit does the same, except the monsters are actually real because it's a fantasy story, and she beats them with a fire poker. \n\n*The children refused to disbelieve in the monsters because, frankly, they knew damn well the things were there. But she\u2019d found that they could, very firmly, also believe in the poker.*", "NTA\nShe's 4. Let her be 4. Your FIL is TA", "NAH, you can raise your kid however you wish. He was trying to give advice. \n\nI do agree it's a bit strange to play into something that scares her rather than say it isn't real though... But if you think that works for her then you do you!", "eh... YTA, but maybe NAH. It's really close.\n\nHe overstepped, but he's a 75-year-old grandfather who might genuinely have been trying to help. If he keeps pushing the boundary, that's a problem, but I'm not sure \"you have no right to tell me how to raise my daughter\" is the best reaction here.\n\nYou're right to tell him that you don't need his help, but I think you could've handled this with more grace.", "NAH. I think what you did is fine if it works for your kid. I'm gonna be generous and assume your FIL was  trying to be helpful, not shitty for no reason. It's pretty normal for in laws to give annoying and completely unsolicited parenting advice. As long as it isn't a constant thing, it's usually best to just ignore it.\n\nNext time, I'd say something like \"this is what works for my family\" and move on. It might be worth examining why this made you so angry, because I feel like this is about more than just this incident.", "NAH, grandpa might just have been trying to help, you could have said thanks but this works for us. \nWhy did you get so angry you marched to go tell your wife? Seems like an overreaction.", "NAH I do find it weird that you are keeping the idea of the scary monster alive rather than dispelling its existence. However it\u2019s your choice. Your reaction to fil\u2019s advice seems a bot extreme, he was just trying to help.", ">My wife (54F) and I (40M)\n\nI notice no one's having a fit over their age gap this time.

You're also supporting your child by showing her that how she feels is valid and won't be ignored. Yeah, sure, there's no monster, and she will come to realise in the future.

NAH, but please, start teaching her that there are no monsters rather than that you can keep them at bay. This shit is terrifying to a child. Pretending they are real isn't helping.", "I know. \ud83d\ude09 I didn't name it because I wondered who else would recognize the line.", "WWSSHD", "I was trying to teach my oldest that there were no monsters that had the opposite effect because she refused to believe it. She was just convinced we as adults couldn't see them, only she could. \nWe used Doctor who as monster deterrent because a lot of children have very active imaginations, and no matter how many times you tell them, they won't believe they're not real. It's more teaching the child they're safe and nothing will hurt them. Once you've got that in their minds, beliefs in monsters soon end up being funny, and then eventually, they don't believe anymore. This does take quite a few sit-down conversations, though."]}
