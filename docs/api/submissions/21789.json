As we were driving back from the party, she called me a \"snowbunny\". She explained how it is a white girl who tends to date POC and that is was a good thing. Once we got back home, I ended up looking it up and from what my understanding of the term is \"a white women who has a fetish for black men\". I honestly feel kinda weird about the term. I have dated interracially before where my partners where mixed being half-black. But, I didn't really date them based off of race. It was more of an attraction to personality (goofy af) and I thought they were really cute. In the past, when I showed her photos of them before, she asked about their background and I answered her without really a second thought. I have felt kinda weird about being called this honestly and I want to ask her more about why she thought that way. I have talked about my other past partners before but background really hasn't been brought up if i showed her a photo. I have mentioned to her a couple of times that i thought her friends where cute. It was always based more off of personality being similar to be in terms of being in STEM and a very outgoing personaility. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1688926213, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14v5d2b/wibta_for_asking_myf21_friend_why_she_called_me_a/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's kind of weird for your friend to comment on that at all, and also weird she'd state it was a \"good thing\". It's neither good or bad, it's just who you prefer to date.", "NTA\n\nIt's just a question and you didn't know the meaning. \n\nYour friend is prejudice though.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s good to start conversations, especially with asking for clarification. Good for you for wanting to talk about it! It can allow others to consider their beliefs and how they sound \u201cout loud\u201d. You have good intentions with this question, and I think you friend can pick up that you mean well.\n\nIMO, I think your friend is racist. But your friend will be the one to remove any doubt.\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA. That is an offensive word. It seems more like she cares about your dating perspective than you do.\n\nThe fact she is so focused on this and called you that is a red flag.", "NTA.  It is a slur and a stereotype  Tell her you don't appreciate it.  Geesh snow bunny used to mean a girl on the ski hill lol.", "NTA and it's usually used in a derogatory manner. Like, my friends and I laugh at the snowbunnies", "NTA. That is NOT what snow bunny means. Your friend is an idiot. Snow bunny refers to women who like to ski so much they practically live on the slopes. You're friend is a bigot and an uneducated one at that", "NTA. But wow I always thought it was women into snow sports (snowboarding/skiing) \u2026 way off lol", "NTA, I've only heard of it as a skiing thing.", "I thought snowbunnys were like buckle bunnies except for skiers and not rodeo riders....\n\nNTA", "Nta, but I think the why is self-explanatory. Your friend probably didn't mean any harm by it, but I understand why it made you uncomfortable, as it's kind of a weird, racially fetishistic term which implies you're chasing black partners instead of just going for who you like . If she jokes like that again, maybe tell her that it makes you uncomfortable", "NTA, but it\u2019s also not a big deal or anything to be upset about. \n\nAs a gay man who loves black men, I am/have often referred to as a snow bunny by my partners. With my husband he says it as a term of endearment, with others its meaning has been more sexual. Doesn\u2019t offend me, doesn\u2019t offend anyone who has ever called me it.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m not 20 anymore, but I think the rest of the people in the comments are either really young or don\u2019t have a lot of real life experience because to say that calling someone a \u201csnow bunny\u201d makes them racist or prejudice is just sad. \n\nYour friend doesn\u2019t sound like a racist, and their explanation of the phrase is essentially the same as what you wrote one sentence later. It didn\u2019t sound like they said it as an insult, you even said they said it was a \u201cgood thing\u201d. Your friend is just saying you have a tendency to like men of color, to take this as an insult shows more prejudice than saying it. \n\nSad I even have to say this, but mentioning race is not racist people! And remember, as always, If you find yourself getting offended about things on the internet, go outside!", "NTA\n\nI appreciate where you\u2019re coming from with your concern, but you\u2019re reading too much into the situation. You\u2019re friend probably said this in passing as a joke, but she needs to know if it bothered you so that she doesn\u2019t make comments like that going forward. If you choose to bring it to her, just do so in a kind and respectful way, make sure you choose your words carefully so that it\u2019s inherently not an attack.", "NTA and that's not what a snow bunny is, a snow bunny is a girl who skis and dates skiers it has nothing to do with poc or white people .", "YWBTA.  She has already explained.  Don't make it weird by reopening the conversation.", "YBTAH  \n\n\nBut I think maybe your friend is trying to use it in a nice way, but yeah the meaning is what it is, so could just be an attempt to reclaim? I don't think your friend would actively try to make you out to be some PoC or Black man fetishizer, honestly probably just a casual observation paired with loose language meant to be nice, but after looking you found that it might not be nice, so seems mean? but really wasn't meant to be. I hope that makes sense.", "YWBTA, but I\u2019d get annoyed if she says it again or makes another assumption like that. Just because your past partners happened to be mixed doesn\u2019t mean you have a thing for that and it was a bit rude of her to imply. But at this point you should let it go and not make it a bigger thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
