I\u2019ve met everyone important to him in his life including one of his best friends and his best friends wife who have a one year old child. I\u2019ve never had a problem with them and have always liked them but we were never close so I was surprised when his wife asked if I would watch their son once a week. She said she could drop him off and asked how far away she thought my boyfriend and I lived from them. I told her it was about a 30 minute drive. She she oh you can just come to my house then and hang out and watch him there. She told me she wouldn\u2019t be able to pay me much which didn\u2019t bother me because I wouldn\u2019t expect to make money off of them but I figured they would at least cover my gas. Well, I was wrong. It\u2019s been over a month now that I\u2019ve been watching him once a week for around 6 hours and they haven\u2019t offered me a cent. Halfway through the month she told me she\u2019d make me bread. The next week, she told me she forgot to make it. No big deal I thought. Then, the next week, she made one loaf for herself that was freshly made when I got there and told me she forgot to make me any. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t need her to make me bread but I just thought it was disrespectful. What really set me off was when we had a 4th of July party and she started talking about how she dropped her son off at his grandmas house and the grandma made a comment about how she herself would always throw people a couple dollars when they watched her kids. This pissed her off and she said paying people to watch her kid wasn\u2019t an option. Then, I overhear her talking to one of my boyfriends other friends who is a tattoo artist about her next tattoo. So, I\u2019m thinking, you can afford a tattoo but not someone to watch your kid? I felt like I was being used. \n\nToday, I texted her and said I wasn\u2019t going to be able to watch her son anymore and then i blocked her, not wanting any conversation about the situation. I just wanted it to be over. Her husband called my boyfriend and told him that they hadn\u2019t heard from me all day which is NOT true. My boyfriend told me I should\u2019ve handled the situation better. I feel disrespected and that my boyfriend should be on my side in a situation where I was obviously being taken advantage of. My boyfriend and I live together and I only work part time while I go to school full time. We\u2019re not rich by any means. I think it\u2019s wrong of his friend and his wife to basically expect me to pay to watch their kid!

Should she have paid you like she said? Yes. \nHowever,  in the future you definitely need a solid answer about payment before you start sitting. I think it's easy for you to *look like* the AH here, and I think that she set it up that way. She wanted you to do it for free, and started out with \"can't pay you much\" and never solidified *anything* and then basically watched to see how long it would take you to confront her.

Consider that they don't offer gas money when you spend an hour driving to babysit. No.", "ROFL. I think you handled it pretty well.\n\nI'm petty so I would have publicly  shamed them at the party, especially when she was talking about the tatoo.\n\n\"Oh, is so nice of you to do a free tatoo for X.  X and Y, are so broke at the moment that can't even pay me for the fuel for me to babysit every week. I mean...even though they agred too pay me for the time, I struggle to say no to CHARITY . I'm so jealous that you have such generous family and friends that help them out for free and without a drop of gratitude back\"", "NTA. Don't make it about the way they spend their money, that way lies madness.\n\n\"Boyfriend, I was doing your friends a favour. I did not *need* to drive all the way to their place and take hours out of my day to look after their kid. I did it because I care about you and you care about them. They *repeatedly* offered me small favours in return but never followed through. I realised that they felt entitled to my help even though I owe them nothing. It was draining to constantly be costing myself money to care for *their* child. Sure, I could have brought it up earlier. Maybe I could have even communicated more. But in the end, I *was* doing them a favour, I told them I wasn't doing the favour anymore, and I made it so they couldn't try to guilt me into helping out. I did it because it's what *I* needed, I couldn't bear the thought of listening to the excuses of why they weren't going to follow through with their promises but that I should help them anyway.\"\n\nIf you're willing to continue babysitting, make it on your terms. They *must* drop off and pick up the baby from you. They *must* pay all expenses you incur taking care of their child. They *must* set precise pick up and drop off times. Any failure to comply with your terms means no more babysitting *ever*. Any \"Why can't you just...?\" arguments are met with \"Why can't *you just...? It's your child and you are asking for a favour\"", "Yes, we\u2019ve talked about it this whole time.

Find a spine.", "NTA. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too bad you handled it that way. They pushed you too far, you were feeling drained, miserable and furious,  and you couldn\u2019t handle a confrontation. They were only going to harangue and guilt trip you and try to keep using you. If you had tried to reply in your current mood, you may well have said something that would have blown up any future friendship much worse than the silent treatment (I probably couldn\u2019t have helped myself). Your BF knew you were at breaking point, so he ought to understand you couldn\u2019t face it and had to walk away.", "NTA but why did you agree to this in the first place? No is a complete sentence", "Nta at all! But next time wait till people read the message before blockingso they can't pull the \"i didnt hear from them:", "NTA\n\nTell your boyfriend to enjoy being an unpaid babysitter.", "If your boyfriend isn't supportive about this I'd start rethinking this relationship. \n\nNTA", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nThey were using you.  Good job realizing it and putting an end to the situation.", "NTA \n\nYou could\u2019ve handled it better & blocking after declining seems a bit over the top as you\u2019ll still have to mix with them as her husband is a close friend of your bf, so that makes for awkwardness \n\nBetter tack might have been to say that you\u2019re on a tight budget & have decided to dedicate your spare 6 hours you\u2019ve been gracing them with to getting more work that pays so alas, you\u2019ll have to stop earning imaginary baked dough", "NTA, bf needs to take off the tinted glasses and see how his BFF and BFFs wife is treating the person his supposed to support.", "YTA to yourself for agreeing in the first place.", "ESH, and you slightly more than the people you were babysitting for.\n\nThat she didn't pay you is crap.\n\nThat you are 27-years-old and you resolve this by texting her you were no longer babysitting and then \\*immediately blocking her\\* \"not wanting any conversation about the situation\" is truly pathetic. It's something a 14-year-old would do. Then to be shocked when the husband reached out to your boyfriend...remember the part where you blocked her? \n\nWhat could have been a minor issue if only you had used your words has been blown into a major drama -- because of your actions.", "If this is as you described, you were being taken advantage of.\n\nWhen you told her you were no longer baby sitting, you might have said something about needing gas money at the very least.

Or is just miffed because his best friend  was miffed?\n\nPerhaps the best friend  was lied by his wife?\n\nEither way, this is NOT your problem.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. Why did you let it go this far?

He won't and instead will gaslight you. This is an indication of how much he values you and is a chance to see reason before it's too late. So, now make a list of all the hours you sat the kids and how much you spent on gas. Take screenshots of proof of times and they didn't pay. Add up a number for the hours and the gas. Tell them to pay and take proof of that. They won't pay. Take it to small claims, it's easier than you think. Get the payment. Ditch the boyfriend. Block em all distancing yourself from these leaches, so you can learn to not fall victim to users again. Live a better life without people that disrespect you..", "NTA. You were taken advantage of. They were using your precious time and your money. Such people do exist, OK, but the problem is your boyfriend. In the very first moment he got to learn what his friends are doing to you, he should have immediately stand behind you, and support you protecting yourself from these people. His attitude is very alarming.", "Nta.  You were being used and you ended it as you should have.", "NTA but you should have been more direct about payment.", "NTA, but I do agree with your boyfriend that you should have handled it better. Stewing for weeks and then one text and blocking her? Not the way to go. A conversation where you at least state that she needs to bring the kid to you would have been a reasonable place to start. You never should have agreed to go to her house, that\u2019s ridiculous.", "NTA.. but you and your boyfriend are a little AH for allowing this to go on for so long", "NTA! I have a policy or a need to avoid people like that and or conversations about issues like this because they tend to gaslight and make it all your fault or try and coerce you into adjusting the terms in order for them to keep using you. So I can\u2019t be too harsh on this, but honestly something I have been working on is holding my ground, and being firm on how I feel. Not letting them gaslight me at least, and dealing with confrontation. Since they are\u2026were rather, friends with your boyfriend did you tell him your feelings, or were you concerned he might try and talk you into continuing \u201cfor him\u201d. Again I understand. You don\u2019t want to put your relationship on the rocks because his friends are being stupid (holding back here). Again I can understand it, but the problem now is that you have to contend with his ire over his buddy and his SO griefing him over what they view as a slight. If he is any kind of boyfriend, he would listen to your side, and admit that they were jerks about it. Or he will side with them and make some issue out of it. I can only hope it goes away, but take a page please on this matter and consider next time talking to your partner about a decision like this so that he knows what\u2019s coming. Not to dictate what you should or should not do, but just so he knows the score and how he might deal with it on his end. If the situation had less to do with him obviously no need to worry about it, but because of the relationship entanglement it might have been a good step to take. Heck he might have been able to help break it off for you if you get my drift. Anyway, still TOTALLY not the asshole here! Your good!", "NTA. 6 hours for no pay?? Even her MIL is sick of her.", "I agree. Sending a one-off text and then blocking immediately isn't decent communication. This could've been handled much sooner if OP had actually said something instead of keeping everything bottled up and ignoring it.", "NTA tell your boyfriend if he has the time then HE can go babysit. You have better things to do with your time and money ( fuel money wasted every week yoU go there)", "I think your boyfriend's support for you is not enough. His support seems superficial and may just be an attempt to placate you with a few casual words, while deep down, he may not truly support you (but of course, this is just speculation).\r  \n\r  \nMoreover, when \"his best friend\" and \"his best friend's wife\" are exploiting their own girlfriends, he didn't stand up against them but instead, he hopes that you can do better? This makes it hard to believe that he would help you when you are facing oppression.", "Then y is he chastising u? That doesn't make a lot of sense unless he was just patronizing u by agreeing because u kept babysitting. His very flippant.", "Exactly the same train of thought as me", "If the bf agrees and doesn't have the time to babysit, he should start paying for the gas or the 6 hour wages. It's clear he doesn't care about OP wasting her time and money on entitled people.", "Nope, op is wasting 7 hours minimum and for what? The mother isn't even grateful , not the smallest thank you gesture. \n\nIt's time for op to use her time as she whishes and the mother to use the tattoo money for her kids babysitter if she needs one.\n\n\n Op isn't their slave and she already helped a month despite not really knowing them . She shouldn't continue this, she doesn't owe them anything and if this goes on op will have trouble when she has other things to do.

Strangers not caring to me is normal, u hope u don't get screwed over, but u can't be shocked when they don't take ur financial situation into consideration. The big issue for me is the bf whose supposed to always support and love OP, isn't and is actually telling her to just be better and keeping babysitting (at least that's my impression of it).\n\n\n I'm of the opinion that if the bf thinks, \"keeping the peace and keeping ur head down/don't complain,\" method is better. He can financially foot the bills, and that includes the hourly wage."]}
