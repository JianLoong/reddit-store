{"id": 23306, "submission_id": "15bn29h", "title": "AITA for quitting babysitting my boyfriends best friends kid?", "selftext": "My boyfriend(30m) and I(27f) have been together for over two years. I\u2019ve met everyone important to him in his life including one of his best friends and his best friends wife who have a one year old child. I\u2019ve never had a problem with them and have always liked them but we were never close so I was surprised when his wife asked if I would watch their son once a week. She said she could drop him off and asked how far away she thought my boyfriend and I lived from them. I told her it was about a 30 minute drive. She she oh you can just come to my house then and hang out and watch him there. She told me she wouldn\u2019t be able to pay me much which didn\u2019t bother me because I wouldn\u2019t expect to make money off of them but I figured they would at least cover my gas. Well, I was wrong. It\u2019s been over a month now that I\u2019ve been watching him once a week for around 6 hours and they haven\u2019t offered me a cent. Halfway through the month she told me she\u2019d make me bread. The next week, she told me she forgot to make it. No big deal I thought. Then, the next week, she made one loaf for herself that was freshly made when I got there and told me she forgot to make me any. \n\nNow, I don\u2019t need her to make me bread but I just thought it was disrespectful. What really set me off was when we had a 4th of July party and she started talking about how she dropped her son off at his grandmas house and the grandma made a comment about how she herself would always throw people a couple dollars when they watched her kids. This pissed her off and she said paying people to watch her kid wasn\u2019t an option. Then, I overhear her talking to one of my boyfriends other friends who is a tattoo artist about her next tattoo. So, I\u2019m thinking, you can afford a tattoo but not someone to watch your kid? I felt like I was being used. \n\nToday, I texted her and said I wasn\u2019t going to be able to watch her son anymore and then i blocked her, not wanting any conversation about the situation. I just wanted it to be over. Her husband called my boyfriend and told him that they hadn\u2019t heard from me all day which is NOT true. My boyfriend told me I should\u2019ve handled the situation better. I feel disrespected and that my boyfriend should be on my side in a situation where I was obviously being taken advantage of. My boyfriend and I live together and I only work part time while I go to school full time. We\u2019re not rich by any means. I think it\u2019s wrong of his friend and his wife to basically expect me to pay to watch their kid!

Either way, you\u2019re NTA for not wanting to watch kid, but these were supposed friends, so maybe a bit more communication (and warning) on your part may have gone a long way (or maybe not-I don\u2019t know these people)", "NTA\n\n Why would you pay for gas and lose 6 hours of your day to watch their kid??", "No, no and no, you are NTA. \nNo, they should have at LEAST paid for gas, that sh!t ain\u2019t cheap at all! \nNo, they are disrespecting your education, and thinking that you \u201cworking part time\u201d is all that you do, while you are going to school full time, which is a huge work load, and immensely important for your future. \nNo, your boyfriend definitely shoulda had your back.

You could have handled it better, but in no way should you be paying (gas money) to babysit this child. You\u2019re in school FT and work PT. You don\u2019t have time to spare!

I have this same reaction whenever I'm volunteered for anything.", "You are NTA but did you talk any to your boyfriend about the situation? He could have talked to them before it got to this as you say it's his best friend. If you haven't communicated with him then he is just as blindsided by everything as well and all he said was you could have handled it better, which he is correct on.", "NTA\n\nshe was using you obv. do they think you have no self preservation? and not to be rude or anything but ur bf sucks at the moment.", "While yes you could have maybe handled it better. No I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. The parents should expect to pay someone for their time. No not make them some bread that they keep forgetting to make. No not cover just the gas. They should pay you for the gas and extra since you are taking time out of your day to watch their kid on a regular basis, if it had been a one time thing then yeah I get it I do you a favor you do me a favor but not on something that was scheduled weekly.", "NTA\n\nI would have approached it differently. Should she have paid you like she said? Yes. \nHowever,  in the future you definitely need a solid answer about payment before you start sitting. I think it's easy for you to *look like* the AH here, and I think that she set it up that way. She wanted you to do it for free, and started out with \"can't pay you much\" and never solidified *anything* and then basically watched to see how long it would take you to confront her. Now you look petty despite the fact that she is taking advantage, and you're not even asking fot that much.", "Why did you agree in the first place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think you handled it pretty well.\n\nI'm petty so I would have publicly  shamed them at the party, especially when she was talking about the tatoo.\n\n\"Oh, is so nice of you to do a free tatoo for X.  X and Y, are so broke at the moment that can't even pay me for the fuel for me to babysit every week. I mean...even though they agred too pay me for the time, I struggle to say no to CHARITY . I'm so jealous that you have such generous family and friends that help them out for free and without a drop of gratitude back\"", "NTA. Don't make it about the way they spend their money, that way lies madness.\n\n\"Boyfriend, I was doing your friends a favour. I did not *need* to drive all the way to their place and take hours out of my day to look after their kid. I did it because I care about you and you care about them. They *repeatedly* offered me small favours in return but never followed through. I realised that they felt entitled to my help even though I owe them nothing. It was draining to constantly be costing myself money to care for *their* child. Sure, I could have brought it up earlier. Maybe I could have even communicated more. But in the end, I *was* doing them a favour, I told them I wasn't doing the favour anymore, and I made it so they couldn't try to guilt me into helping out. I did it because it's what *I* needed, I couldn't bear the thought of listening to the excuses of why they weren't going to follow through with their promises but that I should help them anyway.\"\n\nIf you're willing to continue babysitting, make it on your terms. They *must* drop off and pick up the baby from you. They *must* pay all expenses you incur taking care of their child. They *must* set precise pick up and drop off times. Any failure to comply with your terms means no more babysitting *ever*. Any \"Why can't you just...?\" arguments are met with \"Why can't *you just...? It's your child and you are asking for a favour\"", "Yes, we\u2019ve talked about it this whole time. He would agree with me that he thought I was being used and taken advantage of."]}
