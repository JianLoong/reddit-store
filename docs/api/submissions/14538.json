They chased her, attacked her, left her bleeding and terrified her in her own yard. She became dog-reactive after that. When I explained to my MIL that my dog was now dog-reactive and she could never bring her dogs over again, she tried to insist I get rid of my dog if it was so \"vicious\". She told the whole family my dog was a danger to my children, because apparently if it would attack her \"puppies\" it would attack anything.

She was never anything but sweet to people, and my son now has an urn with her ashes. We treasured her, but had to build an extra fenced area around the house and she didn't leave the house/fenced area for a decade because of how dog-reactive she was and how I STILL could not trust my MIL not to show up with her dogs off leash.\n\nTo this day she will randomly arrive with off-leash dogs.
