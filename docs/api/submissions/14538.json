They chased her, attacked her, left her bleeding and terrified her in her own yard. She became dog-reactive after that. When I explained to my MIL that my dog was now dog-reactive and she could never bring her dogs over again, she tried to insist I get rid of my dog if it was so \"vicious\". She told the whole family my dog was a danger to my children, because apparently if it would attack her \"puppies\" it would attack anything.

She was never anything but sweet to people, and my son now has an urn with her ashes.

I didn't do a thing to that dog.\n\nThe next time was I was walking home, the same corner two houses from my home, when the dog came out of nowhere, knocked me down, and was standing over me snarling and snapping.  I was screaming my head off and a lady came out of a house and got him off me.\n\nMy father was so angry that he went to the owners and told them that if he sees that dog out again, he'll shoot it.
