Even more so when it appears they both purchased the house so even if they aren\u2019t married he has an equal say on if more birds come to live with them. \n\nI can understand why he interprets her getting a pet that will outlive her and requires a large amount of commitment to care for as \u201cunwillingness to have children\u201d.

Should she go ahead with becoming pregnant because of some sort of verbal contract? OP is not obliged in any way to get pregnant  until she is 100% sure she wants to, and she can change her mind whenever she wants. Even if it\u2019s disappointing to her partner.\n\nMaybe ESH.

Fortunately, he got better about it... _Unfortunately_ for the other women I know with similar tales, their men did not. \n\nMy take, from experience, is that men like this are either 1) manipulative/narcissistic dickweeds who just want to trap the woman, 2) wide-eyed naive ning-nongs who don't give it a moment's consideration and think it's going to be all fun and games, and 3) already expect in advance that the woman will be doing most of the hard work/childrearing and they can be \"fun dad\"\n\nThere are good men out there but the sad thing is, you can't tell a lot of the time if you've got a good one until you're already pregnant/the baby's there, because that's usually when the switch flips for the manipulative/abuseive ones. For a sizable amount of women, it's already too late to undo, and now they's stuck with a shitty babydabby, and their child a terrible/unreliable father, by the time the true colours show.\n\n\n~~And in advance, because there are always men who like to get up on the soapbox whenever these kinds of female issues are discussed - yes I know it can happen to men as well, but right now we're talking about the ones that can get pregnant because the subject of the OP is a _pushy man._~~", "I'm not from the US though.

They are not easy and the only reason I put my parrot goal on the shelf is because I don\u2019t think my husband would be as thrilled as me, but we share a house. I will get a cat when I can though.\n\nEveryone in a house has to be on board for such a time consuming and expensive pet.", "As a reluctant father I was really annoyed when I found out the Humane Society wasn\u2019t really very humane at all and was only interested in dogs and cats.\n\nFalse advertising, if you ask me.", "nice", "I should not have laughed so hard at this.", "I needed a laugh, thanks", "Yeah, this. I could be wrong but it doesn't sound like the boyfriend was consulted about the parrot decision, and he definitely didn't get a say about the second one. If they're living together and talking long term plans, then that was a AH move on OP's part.\n\n(At which point I'd argue that it's probably for the best that they don't have a kid together right now. Both pets and kids should be something that both parties want.)", "We have three cats. We didn't have kids as we were unsure how many litter boxes to leave for them when we go away for the weekend.", "Wild pugs roaming the earth lol", "I agree I dont think parrots should be pets. It's almost impossible to give them the enrichment they need. I say the only captivity they should be in is a really good zoo or a good rescue center. Other than that they should be in the wild.", "You give me the impression that owning birds is your entire personality.", "This thread is legitimately insane, everyone I've ever known to have a parrot has also had a full time job, and they all just left the birds in their cages during the day. And none of them had these 8 foot enclosures I keep hearing about either, they just let the birds out of their cages when they got home and had perches in multiple rooms for them to chill on. Definitely high maintenance, pita pets, but comparing them to the responsibility of raising a child is just fucking stupid.", "But the birds don't evaporate, when she has to care for a child, and 2 very fragile, emotionally intelligent animals in addition. AND she got these very complex pets without consulting with herh partner, which is BS, and to be honest, a red flat. IF it were one or the other, that would be one thing, but she wants both. YTA,", "Dude, parenting isn\u2019t just feeding, mitigating tantrums, and changing the newspaper on the floor.\nWith a child comes fear, instilling values and kindness, not just teaching but teaching how to learn, hopes for their future and a slew of other complex emotions and problems.\nI know some bird people really think they\u2019re something special for having birds, you can keep that thought. Just know that a child is leaps and bounds ahead in difficulty and complexity.", "Only people who have never shared a space with a parrot will be downvoting you. You are correct on every point. \n\nI have had a son and a parrot in my life for 30 years. Guess which one still lives at home and demands my constant attention, for whom we need to arrange a live-in sitter if we go on holiday (someone he knows and trusts, no strangers) and for whom I\u2019ve had to make arrangements for his care in my will. Hint: it\u2019s not my son.\n\nSure, a human baby will need more care and a toddler will need more supervision for the first few years of their lives (because the police say you can\u2019t lock THEM in a cage), but anyone who thinks that having a parrot takes less time over their lifetime than a human child has zero clue what they\u2019re talking about.", "As they said, it\u2019s very much dependent on where you live. My partner and I have been together for 20 years, own a house together, and just had our first child. We\u2019re not currently married, but we consulted with a lawyer to confirm that it legally makes no difference with home ownership and parenting (where we\u2019re from). \n\nWe\u2019re not opposed to marriage at all, we plan on getting around to it one day. But it legally makes no difference. Again, where we\u2019re from.", "He agreed to the first parrot, not the second. She did a bait and switch. She wasn't sure but still went a head with it for months. She changed her mind, which she is allowed to do but she ketp it to her that she didn't want to have a kid from him fir a while. That's why I ruled ESH.", "I'm a little concerned parrot Reddit thinks children are like pets? They have a whole host of needs in addition to the admittedly challenging needs of parrots. Like, an education, just for starts. You have to raise a child to be successful adult. Not so with parrots.", "Agreed! Fair enough not to be ready for kids yet. Even if you said you would be, you never really know until you get there, and sounds like they have plenty of time. But buying pets without consulting and getting an OK from the other person whose life will be heavily impacted by that choice?

It's like people are having 5 different conversations AT each other, thinking they're in the same convo...  Lmfao.", "I disagree. I've known people who had parrots AND children. To have parrots, I'm assuming that (like my friends) she knows what she's doing. And IMO *pressuring* someone to have HUMAN BABIES before they are ready is a huge red flag.\n\nEven IF she thought she was ready to have kids, and then decided she changed her mind, that's allowed. Consent isn't concrete. You can change it at any time. \n\nNow, that may mean these two aren't *right* for each other but that's a different conversation.\n\nNTA.", "regardless of where you live, you gotta realize that your partnership is an extreme outlier.  for the majority of hetero couples, if the guy doesn\u2019t want to get married then he won\u2019t want to bother sorting things out with a lawyer either.", "Excuse you! My parrot is in his first year at Yale studying to be a doctor \ud83d\ude24 /s", "Extreme outlier?! Tell that to the majority of my friends, family, and coworkers. Statistically, what we\u2019re doing is quite common. \n\nMaybe this is an American thing? You guys got me feeling like we\u2019re in the 1950\u2019s! \n\n\u201cThe guy doesn\u2019t want to get married\u201d? I hate every part of that statement. Have some respect for men, ffs! What if it\u2019s not a priority for either of you? What if you just want to proceed building a life together because it legally makes no difference?\n\nLike I said, this is definitely dependant on location. But if there\u2019s no legal (or religious) reason to get married, a lot of couples just don\u2019t. They either prefer not to be married at all, or in the case of myself and my partner, we\u2019re just waiting for the right time (financially and logistically) to throw a big ass party so we can properly celebrate our life-long partnership with everyone we know. \n\nI think it\u2019s pretty cool that our daughter will be a part of our wedding. She\u2019ll get to hear about how her mum and dad built a life for 20 years before she was born, and she\u2019ll meet all the people that loved and supported us along the way \ud83d\ude0a"]}
