He was really upset one day and I asked him why. He finally went on to say that he read my diary and didn\u2019t know if we should even be together because I wrote in there that his daughter is ugly. I did not out right say that to him. It wasn\u2019t for him to ever read. I haven\u2019t written in my diary since but I really hurt his feelings. I think she\u2019s a kind and sweet child. But she\u2019s not pretty to me at all.\n\nWith our own child here now, he likes to say \u201cI\u2019m batting 3 for 3\u201d while looking at me for confirmation.
