When we were dating, I used to keep a diary in which I would disclose every detail of my thoughts and emotions.\n\nMy husband found my diary and took it upon himself to read it. He was really upset one day and I asked him why. He finally went on to say that he read my diary and didn\u2019t know if we should even be together because I wrote in there that his daughter is ugly. I did not out right say that to him. It wasn\u2019t for him to ever read. I haven\u2019t written in my diary since but I really hurt his feelings. I think she\u2019s a kind and sweet child. But she\u2019s not pretty to me at all.\n\nWith our own child here now, he likes to say \u201cI\u2019m batting 3 for 3\u201d while looking at me for confirmation. I don\u2019t say anything but I think to myself \u201c1.5 out of 3 ain\u2019t bad\u201d\nI never say anything bad about his other kids and I treat them like my own. AITA\n\n\nEdit: I appreciate y\u2019all bullying me online and in my dms. Y\u2019all probably got bullied as a child by other kids/parents/stepparents etc and this is a trigger for you. I understand that.\nEveryone has thoughts. Anyone who\u2019s had a diary knows most entries are a form of therapy and used to figure out your own thoughts and emotions which is why it is so private. My husband and I have moved past this incident. As I have never mistreated our kids and never will. My opinions have/will never overshadow me pouring into the kids to make them strong and confident in themselves. They won\u2019t ever hear such negativity from me because I know the damage it can do and have seen it first hand. \n\nThank you to those not acting like they never thought a person was not \u201cpretty\u201d.", "created_utc": 1677977326, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11iipr5/aita_for_telling_my28f_husband_28m_that_his/", "score": 2543, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I worked as a NICU nurse, and some preemies reminded me of those trolls with the puffy hair from the 90s. Some were gorgeous even as tiny 27 weekers. Not every baby is cute, but every baby is precious and deserves love.   \n\n\nI don\u2019t get the  Y T A with people saying it\u2019s bad she even wrote that down? It\u2019s her diary and she can write whatever she wants! Her husband invaded her privacy. If he wasn\u2019t prepared to know her most private thoughts, he shouldn\u2019t have snooped.", "Agree. We have to be free to acknowledge what we\u2019re thinking and feeling without judging ourselves. Everyone in here saying YTA for even privately thinking that a kid is ugly probably has a pretty tortured psyche full of self-doubt and shame. How do you live with yourself when you\u2019re judging all your own thoughts-thoughts!\u2014as either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d?", "I didn't know an ugly baby existed til I saw one.

You need to learn to see beauty in all people whatever the outer covering looks like.\n\nEven if OP doesn\u2019t see beauty in *all* people, that she feels this way about her step daughter is concerning. Our emotions about people affect how attractive we find them, so OP saying her step daughter is \u201cnot pretty \u2026 at all\u201d is very revealing about how much she doesn\u2019t care for this child, who, by OP\u2019s own words, is a kind and sweet child. \n\nOP YTA.", "This is it. NTA.", "It\u2019s not gossip. It\u2019s literally the alternative to gossip, which is keeping your own negative thoughts TO YOURSELF. she kept her thoughts private, Jesus, this sub can be real stupid.", "Lol he read her private diary. Private. Diary\u2026private. But yes, it\u2019s her fault she should have put it somewhere more secure because she apparently can\u2019t trust her husband to respect her privacy.

I keep a journal and I find this kind of weird.", "What does that even mean?  I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m a little slow today but aren\u2019t there 3 kids and she only thinks one is ugly so wouldn\u2019t it be 2 out of 3?", "I didn\u2019t understand what that meant.", "Worse, the kid would have been a toddler at the time. Like yeah you can write whatever you want in your dairy but why the hell would you think about a toddler enough to just HAVE to write down that they're ugly?", "She seems to be doubling down with the 1.5 thing though and doesn't seem to be ashamed of criticising a little girls looks.", "Honestly it\u2019s interesting you brought up therapy because journaling is recommended by most therapists to write down uncomfortable or disturbing thoughts and feelings. If she had said this in therapy and her husband found out because he knowingly eacesdropped I don\u2019t think so many people would be coming to his defence.", "Maybe and I've used that... and been supremely embarrassed about what I was writing and burned it. Then changed my attitude and approach because I was humiliated and didn't want anyone to know I was capable of having a thought like that! Holy Hannah.", "She should have wrote that the baby was breathtaking.", "Actually, the kid was younger since it's from when they were dating. \n\nShe was roasting a toddler's attractiveness in her diary.", "It is since she's doubling down so fucking hard and going on about how she's thinking it to herself all the time. She's gonna destroy this little girl bit by bit. He needs to get away from her before the \"you know you're not the prettiest\" comments get to her. Someone whose diary could pass for the roast of a toddler is suspect (she said it was from a while ago when they were dating).", "Full fucking stop. My mouth is HANGING open after reading the OP. Never in my wildest dreams would I ever call a child ugly, ESPECIALLY one in my own family. Even if that child was a literal fucking forest gremlin. Even if the poor baby was giving Gollum tease. What an absolutely hideous thing to say, let alone *leave a paper trail on.* IMAGINE if that poor girl had found the diary instead of her father.", "Right she added it her because she thinks she is clever ... But really she's an ass which I find to be a commen situation", "I have a strong feeling all three kids are like carbon copies of dad too \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah, that part. I worry how she treats his other children. They are young, vulnerable, and potentially in the care of someone who dislikes them.", "He means he has three cute kids\n\nI think she means her kid is cute and one of his is ugly and the last is is okay  but maybe she means their all ugly but there good kids?\n\nI just think judging kids by their looks is gross", "I feel like maybe- maybe- I could imagine writing something about being concerned for what would happen to a little girl who wasn't conventionally attractive in a world obsessed with female beauty. If OP wrote something like that as a private thought that would seem reasonable- diaries are for the thoughts you don't share with others. But thats very different to writing that a kid is ugly.", "So by OP's logic, she should be rooting for her husband to reunite with his ex so his children are raised with both parents.", "Sheeesh I didn\u2019t understand that comment at first but now that you explain it OP is definitely an asshole. How the fuck are people saying NTA?", "\"Dear Diary. Today I met Joe's daughter. God she's a funny looking kid. Of course he thinks she's gorgeous ...\"", "it\u2019s because she doubled down on it in her post. There\u2019s a difference between having a mean thought on accident and having a mean thought, writing it down, and continuing to make mean jokes. \nthe fact that she doesn\u2019t feel guilty about having that thought is concerning", "You\u2019re right. None of them are safe.", "One kid is 0 ugly, and 1 kid is half ugly?", "Or she\u2019s counting the ugly one as .5 so it should be 2.5?", "Her kid is the one and I guess the other two make up 25% each?", "To justify your jealousy of a child getting attention from their father.", "Yeah\u2026I was leaning toward n t a until that last bit.", "Can someone explain the 1.5 out of 3 comment cause I\u2019m not sure I fully understand.

I can\u2019t imagine writing those judgy things in my diary, but if it helps her process it, that\u2019s fine.\n\nAlso, just throwing it out there\u2026 but lots of weird-looking kids turn into serious hotties (I, on the other hand, was a very pretty child and it all went downhill from there.)", "Not everyone is attractive lmao. You can see a kid and be like \u201cthat\u2019s a cute kid\u201d. But there are definitely instances where that DOESNT go thru your mind when you see a child", "OP needs a hobby instead of picking on little kids appearances. How's she going to treat her child if they don't look beautiful to her? Almost sounds like the kind of mother that puts down her children for the way they look.", "No, it\u2019s not.  Thats what journaling is.  Writing down your private thoughts that you wouldnt share with anyone else.  It\u2019s cathartic and helps you sort through what is a fleeting thought and what is how you really feel.", "no, it\u2019s not.", "I know a whole lot of mental health professionals who would disagree with you.", "I have to say, when I love someone, I don\u2019t see ugliness. Im not trying to be all rose garden and fluffy, but truly, if someone were to tell me they think someone is ugly and I love that person, I just can\u2019t fathom seeing it. \nLots of people have said it to me about an extended family member, but I adore that person as they\u2019re so genuine and lovely that I just don\u2019t see bad looks. \nIm not sure if this makes sense, but, not only am I shocked that the OP would think this of a child, I also question how OP really \u201csees\u201d that little girl \ud83d\ude14\nYou know you didn\u2019t need to ask this OP - YTA all the way!", ">giving Gollum tease\n\nI am DYING over here. If I were ever to become a Pageant Mom, this would be the wildly inappropriate styling I'd inflict on my ~~vicarious childhood~~ daughter.

What does she mean \"batting 3 for 3\"?", "I could also see *maybe* making a comment along the lines of \"baby Z's newborn phase was awkward with the super cone head and bruising from the forceps. It was kind of ugly. Hope the new baby fairs better\". Newborns can be super weird looking for the first few days, especially when they are not yours.", "I could see that but she's clearly actively thinking the stepdaughter is ugly and the stepson is barely passable with the 1.5 clever little burn in her head when her husband mentioned how he has 3 cute kids. If she's so worry about their looks then she wouldn't be ranking the stepson as \"half ugly\" in an attempt to make fun of her husband's genetic offering in her head. \n\n\nI'm wondering if she has some jealousy issues with the ex wife and this is her fucked up way of comparing herself and her marriage to theirs or something. Like \"I pushed out a pretty baby while you made some fugly ass kids with the ex.\"", "Yeah, I figured that must be it (or she\u2019s just bad at math).", "It kills me how people just refuse to acknowledge it. I'm so glad your aunt did!", "Eh he\u2019s batting 3 for 3!", "No, the son is half ugly, so he gets 0.5. The stepdaughter receives 0, and OPs child is the only attractive kid so they get a 1, which equals 1.5", "I think she thinks the daughter is 0 and the son is 0.5", "Agreed. You can write whatever you want in your private diary, no matter how petty or messed up.\n\nBut, the doubling down at the end really pushed it over the edge.", "I\u2019m understanding it as OP thinks their own kid  with husband is good looking and that husband\u2019s son is average attractiveness? So one kid is attractive and one kid is half attractive makes 1.5 out of 3 attractiveness? It\u2019s such a truly bizarre thing especially when we\u2019re discussing children that yeah, it\u2019s really hard to fathom.", "She also thinks the other kid is half ugly. The only cute one is her own precious spawn.", "He said three out of three as in all of his kids are beautiful and in her head she thought one and a half ain't bad meaning that her child was beautiful, one of his children is barely passable, and the other (the daughter) is not even close. She is just again thinking his children are ugly it had no bearing to the story yet she felt the need to add it any way and just shows how little shame she feels over what she thought and seems to think about regularly about a child.", "The husband has three kids. The OP thinks one and a half of them are \"successes\" (attractive enough, I guess.)", "Sure but personally if I had that thought about someone I loved I would feel ashamed of myself and if I felt ashamed I definitely would not ad the 1.5 thing at the end I had no impact on the story we had all of it she was just doubling down and adding it to show that she truly does think it and wants us to know it was not a one and done.", "It might go through your mind, but that\u2019s exactly where it should stay.

OP believes his daughter is ugly =0, the son is half ugly =0.5, and her kid is the only cute kid=1, so 1.5/3", "Ugh. That\u2019s fucked up.

Therefore 0.5.\n\nUnlike her desirable child.", "I had a feeling it was something along those lines but wasn\u2019t entirely sure so thank you for explaining! I can\u2019t believe an adult is so malicious and superficial to a child she\u2019s supposed to treat as her own! Poor little thing!", "Yuck! So it is what I thought! \nDefinite ESH, though OP sucks a lot more - and I get VERay triggered by my privacy being invaded.", "Which probably has something to do with OP hating the moms, also.", "Seems like she thinks *her kid* is a whole 1, but her 2 step kids are only equal to  1.5 *together* and shiiiiit..... I'm not sure how OP is splitting that 1.5 between 2 young children but omg OP is totally judged YTA, because excuse me wtf?!?!", "But there are 3 kids, so... 1.5 out of 3 means, she doesn't think much of the 2nd of his either.", "Unfortunately that's normal for parents. The amount of parents I know who are delusional about their kid is outstanding. Biology is a hell of a drug.", "No, that\u2019s the literal foundation of therapy. You can have any kind of feelings, you can\u2019t control it, it\u2019s how you act on them that matters. And according to OP she never conveyed her feelings into actions jn any way. A diary is a 100% private thing, it\u2019s not supposed to be used, seen or anyhow interact with an outside world. Her husband is in \u201cplay stupid games get stupid prizes\u201d boat.", "A diary\u2026is literally a place where you write down your opinions and feelings about anything. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for.", "It... Isn't. Not if you expect your private diary to be *private*. A private diary is a place to vent. It may be a bit hypercritical, perhaps mean-spirited, but it's also contextual-- we didn't get the full paragraph. It's her personal diary. Who cares what she chooses to write?  Feel free to get the opinion of any professional therapist.", "What exactly was said in the diary? I don\u2019t see what exactly was said about the child?\n\nI see where you said the child is not pretty, who cares really? So you had an opinion and it was written in your personal business. Everyone thinks thoughts that should never be spoken or written. A horrible lapse in judgement, sure, but you guys are hysterical.", "Yikes\n\n\n(Thank you. It makes sense now. And OP has problems)", "Nah it\u2019s worse than that. She thinks the stepdaughter is a zero out of one. The son is apparently just so-so (0.5 out of one) and her own child is obviously a 1/1. It adds up to 1.5.", "Exactly. Her child is cute. His daughter is ugly and his son is only half ugly. 1.5.", "Honestly though. You can't be mean in your private diary in case it hurts someone's feelings?", "I love how everyone on here wants to condemn this woman for literal thoughtcrime. Some thoughts are ugly and being able to reckon with them in a journal can be really cathartic for some people. Also everyone is implicitly valuing physical beauty above all else, some people are subjectively and even conventionally ugly and it's also not a big deal. Insulting someone or sharing those opinions with people is wrong because of how it can effect them, but having them isn't, it's the ugly side of being human."]}
