My mom had MS.  I took care of her until it got to the point that I could no longer take care of her on my own.  It fucking broke me to have to do it, but I had to put her in a nursing home.  I still can't forgive myself for doing that, but it was honestly better for her.  \n\nTell your sister that you can't take care of her on your own, and that some type of home will be better for her.  If you have to try to get in touch with an advocate for elderly people.  They should be able to help you get her into someplace that can help her.  \n\nGood luck OP.", "NAH - it's not your responsibility and you've done well by her this long. She needs to realize it's time. I get that she can't come to terms with that, after a long life of independence, but it is what it is. Sometimes a skilled care facility is necessary. \n\nEither that or she needs to look into a home health nurse.", "NTA. Your sister needs to face reality. She doesn't *want* to move into assisted living. She *wants* you to care for her. She wants you to give up your life, a sacrifice for her \"independence.\" *But you can't always get what you want*.\n\nWhat she wants does not matter more than what you want. What she *needs* is 24/7 assistance available. And that is what assisted living is for.\n\nDon't give up your actual independence for her to pretend to be unless you want to.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like your sister can still do some things for herself, she just needs assistance with bathroom and hygiene, and maybe getting in and out of a wheelchair.\n\nYou guys need to determine what is still possible for her to do for herself. Can she get in and out of a wheelchair, or does she need assistance? Can she bathe herself, if someone assists her into a shower chair? Can she cook, get food from the fridge, if she's in a wheelchair?\n\nIf the answer to most or all of these is YES, she might be able to get some nursing assistance from her health insurance. Like someone coming in and getting her in and out of her shower chair every other day, picking up and putting a way a scheduled grocery order some days, helping her cook other days, etc. She might be able to be on a rigid schedule for a few hours a day, five days a week, with you or another relative helping out a few days a week when the nurse is off? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to tell you. Either way nobody is at fault here. If she is truly helpless 24/7, moving to assisted living might be the only logical choice, but hopefully she can take some of her things, and you an keep in touch and keep an eye on her to make sure she is being treated well, and to make sure she doesn't start a huge decline once admitted. I hope you guys can work this out.", "NTA.\n\nI've helped care for my mom (who has dementia) - my dad and her lived together so I wasn't even the primary caregiver. And it's not easy.\n\nIn my experience, most of the people who tell other people to give up everything and become caregivers *have no fucking experience of what that's like and have no godsdamn business saying a damn thing about it.* \n\nMost people I know who've been caregivers understand how hard it is under the best of circumstances, and often advise people against doing it *because they actually understand what it means.* \n\nHere's my experience: my mom is generally very sweet, and even after she's been incredibly difficult she actually thanks me. (You probably know how much of a difference that makes, just knowing you're appreciated.) But she absolutely can be very very difficult. \n\nI made a non-pressured choice to come back and help care for her, because she's done so much for me and I felt this was something I could do. Family that don't live close by absolutely supports me and my dad emotionally and financially.\n\nWe also were able to get professional caregivers to come over on weekdays for at least a few hours.\n\nDad and I supported each other and kind of tag teamed to make sure neither one of us was overwhelmed.\n\nSo it's kind of the \"ideal\" situation.\n\nAnd it was *hard*. Worthwhile, but hard. Much harder on my dad, of course. Probably would've been unmanageable or utterly overwhelming for either of us alone. \n\nThat's how hard it is when you freely choose to help, get recognition and thanks from the patient, and aren't the only person doing the work. \n\nYou? You have none of those emotional buffers and no assistance.\n\nI don't think this is doable without doing damage to your own mental and physical health. \n\nI also think your sister will be better off with professional caregivers. My mom's in a care home now (close by, both dad and I visit frequently), and I will admit that in a lot of ways it's better for my mom. The folks there know what they're doing, they're good at convincing her to comply even when she's being difficult, and the best part is that now when I visit our interactions are 100% positive because the staff do all of the shitty stuff. And because one of us or a family friend visits her daily or close to daily, we've got a pretty good sense of the quality of care. \n\nI don't think you should become your sister's caregiver.\n\nDon't run yourself into the ground because your sister can't let go of her independence. She hasn't had independence in a while, and it absolutely fucking sucks, but she needs to accept that living by herself simply isn't feasible anymore. \n\nBe compassionate. Be helpful and understanding. But be firm. You can't do what she's asking, *and even if you agreed now, you're just pushing the problem down the road.* There's no way you'd be able to provide her quality care in the long term, you'd burn yourself out and put yourself at risk for mental and/or physical problems, *and she's still going to end up in a care facility.* \n\nBoth of you will be better off if she is in a care home with people who know how to care for her, and your time would best be spent visiting her and making sure she's getting good care. \n\nI'm so sorry you have to deal with this; it sucks for everyone. But sacrificing yourself won't solve the problem, and you'll be better able to help if you respect your own limitations and boundaries. \n\nGood luck. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. It sounds like she can pay for around 5 years of skilled care, which should be plenty.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to finally spend what she's got. Does she have kids? If so, let them take over. If not, she needs to get hired help. Having said this, what she's is doing is 100% normal for unreasonable people, which is normal.", "NTA.  I\u2019ve dealt with the cost of 24/7 home care vs in-patient, and had to weigh the patient\u2019s wishes of independence over reality.  I\u2019m so sorry for you and your sister.  Truly.  \n\nDo not become her caregiver.  \n\nBe her sibling, her confidante, her best friend, her advocate, her cheerleader.  Be her POA, her next of kin.  Be all the things.  But let a professional do the caregiving, preferably in a facility.  Spend time with her, as family.  Meals, movies, memories, holidays.  Do her nails. Do her hair.  Look at old pictures and reminisce.  \n\nIt may take a therapist, or a social worker, or both, to convince her, but it will be better for you and her .  Then you can stay her family, not her nurse.  Mentally, it will be a saving grace.\n\nJust my opinion.  Good luck, really.  This situation sucks.", "NTA. Her savings is for her care. She doesn\u2019t want to go to a home and she has the money to pay for her care. No one is entitled to an inheritance\u2014the money is to take care of her. You are not required to give up your life for her.", "I had a weird, unsocialized, cranky uncle who lived alone for many years.  After a series of strokes he had to go to a nursing home.\n\nWhen I visited him in the nursing home he was a surprisingly nice, kind person, even though he remained bedridden.  I could only conclude that he was given the right mixture of happy pills.\n\nYour sister is frustrated and unhappy right now, OP.  It seems to me that the right medications might greatly change her outlook on life.  Interacting with different people might help her mood, too.\n\nIn any event, it sounds like you are no longer qualified to give her the greater level of care that she may need.  Tell the social worker at the nursing home that you don't feel that you can't care for her adequately anymore, and that she needs another placement.  \n\n*You may have to do a quick move out of the house to prevent becoming her permanent caretaker*.  If the social worker thinks that there is supervision in her house she'll be sent home, and the case could get put on the back burner.\n\nYou have been good to your sister, OP, and done your duty.  It's time now for her to get a professional level of care.  Please don't let yourself feel guilty, when you have already cared lovingly for her for seven years.\n\nNTA", "NTA. What does she want?  What happens if she outlives her money?\n\n100% rule out you being her carer! Maybe you live in the same place. Maybe you run an errand or two, but no physical care.\nWhat does in home care cost to wash and change her?  It has got to be cheaper than a facility.  \nSay you pay $20hr for 4 hours a day. Abt 29,000 a year vs.20k per month!!??  It's not like babies who shit nonstop all God Damned day.\n\nIDK.  I could just be a drunk who really thinks you should cuh.cug. chh. Call KEVORKIAN.
