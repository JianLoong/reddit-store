Her husband passed away in 2015 and it quickly became clear she could not live on her own.  In 2016 she asked me to come and stay with her and I agreed because I wasn't in a serious relationship and we have gotten along famously our whole lives.  Along the way she lost ability to walk, hasn't bathed in three years because she refuses help and pitches an absolute bitch when I have female friends over.  All that being I was still able to have a personal life and travel etc because she was able to care for herself and change her own diapers etc.  About three weeks ago she lost feelings in her legs and went to skilled nursing facility and determination has been made she can no longer be alone in the house or change her own diaper.  She will be back home in three days and she is refusing to go into an assisted living facility.  She has maybe 900k in savings and round the clock care will cost her 20k a month.  I know if I become her caregiver my life is over because I will have to be here to change her diapers and make sure she doesn't fall etc.  If I became her caregiver it would save her 20k a month but cost me my freedom because I can't leave her alone to travel etc.  AITA for thinking she should move to a facility instead of slowly going broke?  She could 5k a month and be somewhere really nice and not even have to touch her savings because her retirement is 6k a month.

I still can't forgive myself for doing that, but it was honestly better for her.  \n\nTell your sister that you can't take care of her on your own, and that some type of home will be better for her.  If you have to try to get in touch with an advocate for elderly people.  They should be able to help you get her into someplace that can help her.  \n\nGood luck OP.", "NAH - it's not your responsibility and you've done well by her this long. She needs to realize it's time. I get that she can't come to terms with that, after a long life of independence, but it is what it is. Sometimes a skilled care facility is necessary. \n\nEither that or she needs to look into a home health nurse.", "NTA. Your sister needs to face reality. She doesn't *want* to move into assisted living. She *wants* you to care for her. She wants you to give up your life, a sacrifice for her \"independence.\" *But you can't always get what you want*.\n\nWhat she wants does not matter more than what you want. What she *needs* is 24/7 assistance available. And that is what assisted living is for.\n\nDon't give up your actual independence for her to pretend to be unless you want to.", "NAH\n\nIt sounds like your sister can still do some things for herself, she just needs assistance with bathroom and hygiene, and maybe getting in and out of a wheelchair.\n\nYou guys need to determine what is still possible for her to do for herself. Can she get in and out of a wheelchair, or does she need assistance? Can she bathe herself, if someone assists her into a shower chair? Can she cook, get food from the fridge, if she's in a wheelchair?\n\nIf the answer to most or all of these is YES, she might be able to get some nursing assistance from her health insurance. Like someone coming in and getting her in and out of her shower chair every other day, picking up and putting a way a scheduled grocery order some days, helping her cook other days, etc. She might be able to be on a rigid schedule for a few hours a day, five days a week, with you or another relative helping out a few days a week when the nurse is off? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't know what to tell you. Either way nobody is at fault here. If she is truly helpless 24/7, moving to assisted living might be the only logical choice, but hopefully she can take some of her things, and you an keep in touch and keep an eye on her to make sure she is being treated well, and to make sure she doesn't start a huge decline once admitted. I hope you guys can work this out.", "NTA.\n\nI've helped care for my mom (who has dementia) - my dad and her lived together so I wasn't even the primary caregiver. And it's not easy.\n\nIn my experience, most of the people who tell other people to give up everything and become caregivers *have no fucking experience of what that's like and have no godsdamn business saying a damn thing about it.* \n\nMost people I know who've been caregivers understand how hard it is under the best of circumstances, and often advise people against doing it *because they actually understand what it means.* \n\nHere's my experience: my mom is generally very sweet, and even after she's been incredibly difficult she actually thanks me. (You probably know how much of a difference that makes, just knowing you're appreciated.) But she absolutely can be very very difficult. \n\nI made a non-pressured choice to come back and help care for her, because she's done so much for me and I felt this was something I could do. Family that don't live close by absolutely supports me and my dad emotionally and financially.\n\nWe also were able to get professional caregivers to come over on weekdays for at least a few hours.\n\nDad and I supported each other and kind of tag teamed to make sure neither one of us was overwhelmed.\n\nSo it's kind of the \"ideal\" situation.\n\nAnd it was *hard*. Worthwhile, but hard. Much harder on my dad, of course. Probably would've been unmanageable or utterly overwhelming for either of us alone. \n\nThat's how hard it is when you freely choose to help, get recognition and thanks from the patient, and aren't the only person doing the work. \n\nYou? You have none of those emotional buffers and no assistance.\n\nI don't think this is doable without doing damage to your own mental and physical health. \n\nI also think your sister will be better off with professional caregivers. My mom's in a care home now (close by, both dad and I visit frequently), and I will admit that in a lot of ways it's better for my mom. The folks there know what they're doing, they're good at convincing her to comply even when she's being difficult, and the best part is that now when I visit our interactions are 100% positive because the staff do all of the shitty stuff. And because one of us or a family friend visits her daily or close to daily, we've got a pretty good sense of the quality of care. \n\nI don't think you should become your sister's caregiver.\n\nDon't run yourself into the ground because your sister can't let go of her independence. She hasn't had independence in a while, and it absolutely fucking sucks, but she needs to accept that living by herself simply isn't feasible anymore. \n\nBe compassionate. Be helpful and understanding. But be firm. You can't do what she's asking, *and even if you agreed now, you're just pushing the problem down the road.* There's no way you'd be able to provide her quality care in the long term, you'd burn yourself out and put yourself at risk for mental and/or physical problems, *and she's still going to end up in a care facility.* \n\nBoth of you will be better off if she is in a care home with people who know how to care for her, and your time would best be spent visiting her and making sure she's getting good care. \n\nI'm so sorry you have to deal with this; it sucks for everyone. But sacrificing yourself won't solve the problem, and you'll be better able to help if you respect your own limitations and boundaries. \n\nGood luck. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. It sounds like she can pay for around 5 years of skilled care, which should be plenty.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to finally spend what she's got. Does she have kids? If so, let them take over.

I\u2019ve dealt with the cost of 24/7 home care vs in-patient, and had to weigh the patient\u2019s wishes of independence over reality.  I\u2019m so sorry for you and your sister.  Truly.  \n\nDo not become her caregiver.  \n\nBe her sibling, her confidante, her best friend, her advocate, her cheerleader.  Be her POA, her next of kin.  Be all the things.  But let a professional do the caregiving, preferably in a facility.  Spend time with her, as family.  Meals, movies, memories, holidays.  Do her nails. Do her hair.  Look at old pictures and reminisce.  \n\nIt may take a therapist, or a social worker, or both, to convince her, but it will be better for you and her .  Then you can stay her family, not her nurse.  Mentally, it will be a saving grace.\n\nJust my opinion.  Good luck, really.  This situation sucks.", "NTA. Her savings is for her care.

After a series of strokes he had to go to a nursing home.\n\nWhen I visited him in the nursing home he was a surprisingly nice, kind person, even though he remained bedridden.  I could only conclude that he was given the right mixture of happy pills.\n\nYour sister is frustrated and unhappy right now, OP.  It seems to me that the right medications might greatly change her outlook on life.  Interacting with different people might help her mood, too.\n\nIn any event, it sounds like you are no longer qualified to give her the greater level of care that she may need.  Tell the social worker at the nursing home that you don't feel that you can't care for her adequately anymore, and that she needs another placement.  \n\n*You may have to do a quick move out of the house to prevent becoming her permanent caretaker*.  If the social worker thinks that there is supervision in her house she'll be sent home, and the case could get put on the back burner.\n\nYou have been good to your sister, OP, and done your duty.

She had slowly declined over a decade with cancer and a stroke to the point where the hospital would not let her back home without a full care plan after a bad fall. They strongly recommended a care home which she was absolutely refusing to do. \n\nShe tried all the tricks in the book to convince us not to but we held firm. It was in her best interests and she would have ended up dying alone in her home if we had given in. So we researched the best facilities available in her area and found a great one. \n\nOn the day she moved in she told us how she felt abandoned by her children. How could we do it to her? I loved the bones of my Mum but the emotional blackmail and manipulation was strong with her. She carried on chastising us by phone for the first few weeks. Then something amazing happened which I want to share with you OP to give you some hope. \n\nThe incredibly compassionate and skilled staff began to slowly engage her with activities. They got the measure of her pretty quickly so asked her for help with certain group events saying that it would all go to hell in a hand basket without her. They were very wiley! Within a couple of months my Mum was living her best life. They made her feel valuable and needed. She always proudly told us that the place would fall apart without her. I had not seen her so happy or her life so full for a decade. \n\nWe lost her around 5 years later but I can honestly say that those last years in the care home were some of the happiest of her life. \n\nAll of this is to say that if you and your sister take the time to research and visit good facilities, and find one that suits her and her needs, it could transform her life for the better. When people in your sister's state of health go to good quality care homes it actually gives them more freedom and independence. She won't see this right now of course and will in all likelihood fight it.
