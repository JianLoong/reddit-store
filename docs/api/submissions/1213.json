A while back she told me somethings about her ex and she said that someone told her that her ex got a new car.

Your gf has not done anything wrong, you're just worried that she *might*.  You need to deal with your insecurities, because it is very normal for people to remain connected to exes on social media or to receive updates on them via mutual connections, especially the deeper you get into adulthood."]}
