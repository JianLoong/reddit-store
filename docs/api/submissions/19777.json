I really wasnt trying to give him a hard time but over time I start to notice he wasnt trying to say my name correctly and he looked like he didn't care at all. This made me slightly annoyed.

I love my name and he was asking him to change it so I went to the principal to report him but they blame it on his speech issues saying that I need to deal with it and help my teacher and dont be so rude about it. \n\nThe next day when he mispronounced my name, when I called his name I mispronounced his name on purpose with this he got super angry and I had detention for a week.

I didn't TRY because I had this awful woman say to me that me trying and failing was \"proof\" that people with speech impediments shouldn't work with children because they'd \"teach\" the children their speech impediment. I worked in daycare for close to 15 years and none of my children (or parents) ever had that issue - but I do respect that can happen - my own sister couldn't say her name properly because I couldn't! \n\nBut anyway, I had a super kind educator friend who noticed my problem and pulled me aside and said \"Can you not say (child's) name? Like, physically?\" and I nodded. The sounds just weren't coming together, so she actually sat there with me, broke it down, and then joined it back up, and she corrected me every time - and we told the kids \"just like you guys learning how to say it properly Miss (my name) is trying too. Can we all help (my name) say it slowly if she says it wrong? and nicely - she's not doing it to be mean - her brain is being tricky and sending her the wrong sounds to her mouth\".
