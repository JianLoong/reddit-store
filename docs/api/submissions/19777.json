I love my name and he was asking him to change it so I went to the principal to report him but they blame it on his speech issues saying that I need to deal with it and help my teacher and dont be so rude about it. \n\nThe next day when he mispronounced my name, when I called his name I mispronounced his name on purpose with this he got super angry and I had detention for a week.

I didn't TRY because I had this awful woman say to me that me trying and failing was \"proof\" that people with speech impediments shouldn't work with children because they'd \"teach\" the children their speech impediment. I worked in daycare for close to 15 years and none of my children (or parents) ever had that issue - but I do respect that can happen - my own sister couldn't say her name properly because I couldn't! \n\nBut anyway, I had a super kind educator friend who noticed my problem and pulled me aside and said \"Can you not say (child's) name? Like, physically?\" and I nodded. The sounds just weren't coming together, so she actually sat there with me, broke it down, and then joined it back up, and she corrected me every time - and we told the kids \"just like you guys learning how to say it properly Miss (my name) is trying too. Can we all help (my name) say it slowly if she says it wrong? and nicely - she's not doing it to be mean - her brain is being tricky and sending her the wrong sounds to her mouth\".

It's your name, use it with pride and don't let anyone else tell you differently.", "NTA. As someone with a long, hard-to-pronounce (Dutch) surname, I feel your pain. If had a dollar for every time someone mispronounced my name, I swear I could build my own spaceship. Most people genuinely try to pronounce it correctly which I do appreciate, even if they get it wrong (which they usually do). But for him to just not bother is BS. If he was a supply teacher you were only having for a day or two or if he was genuinely having a crack at getting it right, you could give him a free pass, but THREE MONTHS?? He has speech issues where your name is the only one he can't pronounce?? Yeah, nope. And for him to give you detention for giving back as good as you got? That's BS on top of more BS. It might be time to get your parents involved. It's bordering on bullying at this stage.", "Simple. If he doesn\u2019t pronounce it correctly don\u2019t respond if you want your attention, he can call you by your name.", "NTA. He's aggressively being TA. It is disrespectful not to address someone by their name when you know it. It's a while nother level of distract to insist on calling them by a different name altogether and tell them to just go with it because you can't be bothered to use their name or to use it properly. And i love you called him by the wrong name. My name is Kate, but i have worked with people who continued to call me Kathy no matter how many times I corrected them, and years ago, i started calling people who call me the wrong name more than twice by other names instead of their own, because they shape up real quick when it's their own name being disrespected. Funny just how much a Tom HATES being called Tim. Stick to your guns; I'm betting he'll fold. Call everyone telling you to just take it by names which are not their own until THEY fold. Your teacher knows your name, and by refusing to use it, he's creating a hostile environment and harassing and possibly discriminating against you. Good luck.", "NTA and I'm surprised you have enough time left in school to even complete out that punishment", "It isn't always a sign of disrespect.  Some people genuinely have trouble pronouncing certain names.  For instance, due to certain sound combinations being more difficult for people from different linguistic backgrounds.", "Except that sometimes it \\*is\\* that hard.  But if that's the case, the teacher should have explained what the cause was.", "I mean a teacher has asked me to go home and dye my hair before so it is possible", "But it sounds like the other kids all accept the altered versions of their names, and you are the only one who gets upset about it. So of course you're gonna be the only one he suggests a nickname for; you're the only one who seems to need it.", "YTA. It\u2019s clear from your comments that you know the teacher can\u2019t pronounce certain letters, and I\u2019m not buying your assertion that you\u2019re being completely innocent. I\u2019m betting you mocked the teacher\u2019s speech impediment when you mispronounced their name, and that\u2019s how you ended up in detention. Welcome to consequences for being a jerk in school.", "NTA. As a teacher in a school where the students names are in a different language, I make the effort to learn how to pronounce each ones name and surname, that I teach. \nHe can at least try.", "NTA. At worst racist, at best disrespectful. I'd be mortified if months on I was still mispronouncing a student's name - what kind of teacher is that poor at learning something so simple?\n\nI'm furious the school supports him in comtinuing to misname you, and even requesting you CHANGE YOUR NAME for his convenience? Repugnant.", "NTA my name is unusual and people get it wrong all the time. I always correct them politely a few times, but if it\u2019s something that continues on for a prolonged period of time I start to butcher their name on the same way. It\u2019s amazing how quickly people get things right when you do this", "I'm a male teacher, and when I get a students name wrong, I'll get the student to help me say it correctly. I put in a lot of effort to try get it as correct as possible. Obviously, because of accents / other languages I might not get it perfectly, but I do my best to get it as close as possible. \n\nNTA but Mr V is the AH", "Info: ^^ \n\nDo they mispronounce certain letter sounds due to a speech impediment, ie; lisp, rhotacism? Or do they just refuse to learn your name?", "So if he can't pronounce \"th\" he shouldn't be bothered to call her \"Ms Smiff\" if that's the best he can do, but insist instead that she be known in class as, say, \"Blondie\"?", "Why? He is under zero obligation to share private information. At all. Ever.", "In your post you said your name is \"very difficult to pronounce\". What is it, very difficult or only slightly difficult? Make up your mind.", "Just tell us your damn name, we aren\u2019t gonna find out who you are. If he has a speech impediment then he can\u2019t really help that, and if it just offends you he doesn\u2019t try to say your name right but he\u2019ll try for others then \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nMy younger brother had a severe underbite and therefore a horrible speech impediment, growing up with him I never really noticed it much but he got double jaw surgery a few years ago and it\u2019s fixed, watching back old videos I\u2019m like holy shit his speech was bad. I remember trying to teach my brother when we were kids but his mouth just couldn\u2019t make the sounds. Your teacher is probably the same.", "YTA because you left out that the teacher has a speech impediment. And literally cannot (not will not) pronounce your name properly. \n\nAnd while the teacher asking you to change your name is rude, the teacher is probably also getting annoyed at getting asked to do something he can\u2019t every day for three months. That\u2019s like asking a person in a wheelchair to stand for the national anthem, every day, and then feeling disrespected that he doesn\u2019t", "Don't underestimate the value of making an honest attempt at someone's name, people! Especially when they're used to people mispronouncing it!\n\nI used to work at an inbound call centre. I get a call from a customer with a foreign name and accent. (Indian I think). At the time I didn't think the call was going well. He seemed annoyed with an issue and it didn't feel like I was helping, and it felt like he was unsatisfied at my attempts to resolve it. But the one thing that did go well is that at the start of the call I listened carefully to how he pronounced his name and made a real, honest attempt to get it right. I then asked, \"Did I pronounce that correctly?\" And he says, \"Surprisingly, yes!\"\n\nNear the end of the call when I thought he was still annoyed  and unsatisfied with my resolution, and I was genuinely thinking it was one of my less successful calls, he asks to speak to my manager to put in a good word about me, because he was impressed with my customer service. In particular, he was impressed that I made a real effort at his name and even got it right, which literally had never happened to him before so quickly when speaking to an Australian.\n\nIt really drove home to me the value of making an effort even when it's difficult.", "YTA. He knows he is not able to correctly pronounce your name, so he\u2019s not going to put himself through the humiliation of an attempt- he\u2019s an adult living with a speech impediment and he knows his limits. It would have been nice if he\u2019d pulled you aside early on and explained that he will never be able to pronounce your name and worked with you on finding a compromise, but he didn\u2019t. You, however, publicly shamed someone with a speech impediment. Not acceptable. He is not physically able to pronounce it- you need to grow up and accept that people are not going to humiliate themselves to placate you when achieving your desired goal is literally not possible. Respect his limits and back off.", "What country do you live in?", "I think we need to hear the pronunciation vs what it should actually sound like. \n\nIf he has a speech impediment and your name uses the letters he has difficulty with then you can\u2019t expect him to do anything about that. \n\nHowever if he is making a ridiculous mispronunciation simply to be stubborn then he would be TA.", "You did the right thing. Learn at least 10 variations of his name, use them as much as possible. He is a jerk.\n\nAlso, talk to the school counselor or a trusted teacher as he is clearly bullying you based on a difficult name, probably different ethnicity.", "My teachers even get confused with simple names- but they always try to say the correct name ( typically Eva being pronounced with a hard e or a longer e ) he is doing this on purpose and is trying to be an ass NTA", "NTA\n\nPronouncing someone's name correctly is a question of showing respectful mannerisms and teachers should do that the same as students. I find it sad that a friend if mine actually gave up on telling people how to pronounce his name correctly. His name is Michael but is neither pronounced English nor German but still pretty easy (actually if you would combine both you had his, lol) but he gave up on it and always introduces himself by telling people they may choose between the English or German form. It's a shame. Not to mention that Germans are normally pretty strict about using the original pronunciations and grammar of words. Weird that they can't do the same with a name.", "NTA hahahahaha. I have a slightly different spelling of a common name and it gets on my nerves when people are asking me for help or replying to an email and they get my name wrong. It\u2019s lazy and disrespectful. I pulled a guy up on it and he told me to suck it up so I started spelling his name with a c not a k and he never got it wrong again", "OP has said that his teacher has a speech impediment that stops him from pronouncing some of the letters in ops name.", "He's got a speech impediment and can't pronounce certain letters, OP is TA. Bless the poor bloke", "He can't.", "The teacher has a speech impediment that stops them from pronouncing it right.", "YTA. He's tried. No matter what he does, he can't produce those sounds. No amount of you correcting him will change that. No amount of attitude on your part will fix it.

I remember reading he said it's too hard to remember. What did I miss?\n\nEdit: read it now. So no, OP, if he is unable to pronounce it it's not his fault, even though he should have told you in private to diffuse the situation, but I guess it's not easy being a teacher with peach impediment. So ignore my prior post and be nice", "Oh absolutely. The fact the principal was quick to tell a student about an employee's medical conditions is actually quite concerning in my opinion.", "The way I've read it and from what OP has said, their teacher can't pronounce certain letters in OP's name. I've read it as the \"changing their name\" is perhaps asking if they go by anything other names or a nickname like some kids do that he may be able to pronounce", "How do you know he isn't trying?", "NTA, I would show him the same respect that he shows me and never use his name correctly until he made some effort. Your teacher is an asshole and very disrespectful. Good on you.

Not a winnable situation.", "NTA, he could write a note and leave it on his desk with it spelled out for eg Lilah - \u2018Lee-laa\u2019. \n\nHe just cba and that sucks", "NTA \n\nTell them to tell him to change his name? Where are your parents? If you were my kid you wouldn\u2019t be serving one minute in detention.

I\u2019m confused on why this was handled this way.", "From now on, his name is always going to be something not his name.
