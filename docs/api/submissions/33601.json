I'm not normally one to say \"leave\" because marriages are far more complex than a few sentences could tell us,  but this point right here needs to be addressed and fixed yesterday.  He should not still have pictures with his ex-wife displayed in your home.  Keeping the pictures is one thing, displaying them in your face is another.

This is way more than Xmas plans for sure. Thank you so much for insight!", "Idk, marriage? You gotta admit that was funny though! \n\nNot gonna divorce him over being a mommy and daddys boy but I might over other shit, that plays a role regarding his parents. \n\nI will say his own friends joke about how close he is with them because they talked an hour or more everyday for 20 years and he visits them 1-2 weekends a month. Sometimes he would call his dad on their drinking day so he could say he is with his friend, that knew his dad long before I ever did.  Idk how to explain it.

Is it a little sad? \n\nI hate to be a nag about that, I wish my dad was alive or else I\u2019d probably do the same. He just doesn\u2019t have a life \noutside of them. It\u2019s hard to get him to come out with my friends and most of the time I leave him at home. I even\ncome home sometimes and he\u2019s on the phone with his dad. lol", "I left him a note on the counter saying go to your parents because I\u2019m going to feel like he\u2019s only staying because I said so. \n\nI would have liked to go to this pancake Christmas feed on Christmas Eve morning, it goes until 11am. \ud83e\udd5e I didn\u2019t tell him about it yet but I just found out about it recently. Pancake feed or not, I needed my husband with me on Christmas Eve marking a first year my grandma died.  My grandma loved to travel and do things while I\u2019m quite the opposite so seeing that pancake thing was like a sign to me to get out and have fun!!\n\nI would have been ok with him coming back on Christmas Eve, after running gifts down, to be honest but to just dismiss that like he didn\u2019t make plans hurt. \n\nOn that note, I included what I heard him say a couple days ago  \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019ll let you know\u201d to his mom. (I said what don\u2019t you know and she said what you doing for Christmas) then I included what he said today. He\u2019ll feel like he has to stay but I said \u201cyou need to go, you didn\u2019t want to be here with me anyways, we will talk when you get back\u201d because he can\u2019t fix a broken promise and what he said on that phone call and what he said today. I was nice about it.  (I\u2019ll probably pack up and leave when he\u2019s gone some weekend)\n\nAnyways, I reached out to my best friend to see if I could take her kids to the pancake feed on Christmas Eve and she said \u201cyes! I could use a morning break before the madness! They are excited to see you!\u201d Followed by \u201cyou\u2019re more than welcome to join us on Christmas, we don\u2019t focus on gifts here, we focus on family time, playing games and the kids usually make personal Christmas cards to send out to family who are out of town\u201d \ud83d\ude0a I\u2019m excited too!", "I feel like it does change things because it\u2019s not as if she has issue with him seeing his family often and it\u2019s not as if he doesn\u2019t get to see them often which would make it more important to see them on Christmas. \n\nAfter a certain age, your partner is your immediate family, I feel like by far the worst thing he did here is not him having unexpected change of plans, it\u2019s him not inviting her to come with him. He immediately said it as if he would go on his own which is so strange he didn\u2019t even invite her just assumed she would be fine to stay home alone on Christmas. What partner does that?", "Forgot to add he sees his family enough** \ud83d\ude02 just give me a holiday.

That you can't force him to love you, and you're tired of begging for him to care. \n\nAnd then if you see him packing his bag to go visit, pack a second bag to put in the trunk for him so he's got most of his crap. \n\nAnd then get you a divorce lawyer. \n\nOur if he doesn't go, find a therapist or counselor if you want a shot at staying married. \n\nBut NTA all the way", "Looks like you know one of the main reasons he was divorced when you met him.

Those children were his while he was married to their mom, and they likely think of them as their grandchildren. I'm guessing you did take some photos down because you were upset and they had the kids in them. That would explain why his parents are upset at you.

I wish my parents lived closer or else I\u2019d be there right now. I\u2019m going to make it known tomorrow that I don\u2019t feel like a priority. \n\nHe does act like a child. \n\nI came home today, had mud on shoes, took out hose to hose them off then put hose back up because it\u2019s winter. I went to get in the shower afterwards. He came to talk to me in the shower if I turned the faucet on and about putting the hose up because it\u2019s winter and that I don\u2019t know things so he has to remind me.  I just walked straight to the shower because I felt gross \ud83e\udd22 and that was the first convo we had. I said yes I know dear.  (I know things but just comments that to belittle me\u2026 I know not to leave hose on when it\u2019s winter time and I\u2019d appreciate the reminder if I didn\u2019t hear belittle comments all the time)\n\nFor dinner, I got out some left overs and put it on the plate then in the microwave.

He went to bed and slammed the door.  \n\nSide note: I have to take sleeping aides, get hungry when I take them to the point I wake up hungry sometimes, so I snack on gushers at night and leave the empty bag on the counter when I\u2019m half asleep/half awake. Most nights I don\u2019t even recall take a water cup and leave it on living room side table. It\u2019s usually in the sink when I wake up. Not like I\u2019m a dang pig, I was gonna put it away after I\u2019m done warming up left overs. \n\nHe also has some weird issues about having my office window up (converted 3rd bedroom to office) and says I\u2019m a tramp (literally said tramp) if I wear a tank top and say you\u2019re giving them a good view. It\u2019s weird. He doesn\u2019t even use the office but says I don\u2019t want the house shown with window up, slams the door shut like a child. I understand it is a problem if I leave window open if I\u2019m not in there or not home, I get that. He has some weird issue about it though. \n\nHe also belittles me about my short stubby finger nails. Sometimes I\u2019m a nail biter but with my job I don\u2019t get polish so they\u2019re just short nails. It\u2019s odd. \n\nWowza I\u2019m getting free therapy tonight and already happier clearing stuff up on what I need to do. I have no problem showing him my comments either but he will turn this shit on me instead of accountability/communication/working on stuff which just clarifies everything.  \n\nSorry for excess info you didn\u2019t ask for but this post helped me so much tonight more than you know.\n\nThanks so much. I\u2019m definitely going to show him my comments because I\u2019m not hiding it or talking behind his back, I think. This is real shit and I wanted to hear I\u2019m not alone. I feel bad I had to do this and talk bad about you in a way but not really. Ya know. Thank you!!!!!", "I\u2019m starting to gather the reasons including the cards from his parents saying \u201cso glad we get to see you more\u201d after he didn\u2019t celebrate holidays with his family when he was married to his ex\u2026.. like hmmm wonder why? All making sense on why they bitched she didn\u2019t want holidays at their place  and why they felt unwelcome when he was married to her.  I\u2019m not gonna go ask her on the real reason.  \n\nI know being forced into adopting her adult kids to make his parents happy, when he stated from his young days he just doesn\u2019t want to be a dad, weighed on their marriage but I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t 100% that. \ud83e\udd28 look at my comment on another reply if you want the story on that. \u26ab\ufe0fI wish I could go back in time and tell him not to do the adoption, the kids are over 18, tell your parents not your problem really they\u2019re over 18\u2026. They\u2019d still be married to this day. I love him enough to do that for him. He said he would have welcomed them with open arms if they went home to visit but his parents wanted adoption papers to be okay with marriage and just forced him to be the main dad\u2026. But the bio dad was still around so it\u2019s like his parents wanted him to be the dad, not two dads \u2639\ufe0f I never wanted kids and everyone says you might in your late 30s and 40s. If it happens it happens but I\u2019ve been taking precaution for it not to happen as did he.Sometimes you just know when you don\u2019t want kids.\u26ab\ufe0f \n\nI\u2019m trying to tell myself not to worry too much on why they split.

I made a comment down below of the picture  situation\u2026.

Other picture he shot with his gun for target practice but don\u2019t have a video of that.\n\nIt just sucks.

I think if I delete it now he won\u2019t say anything and I\u2019ll test that theory.  We got Life360 because I work night shift as er nurse 3 times a week and wants to know when I get home because he works 5a-11a and whatever.\n\nI once had access to security stuff but not anymore.   \n\nThis is not a healthy relationship. This was so much more than a Xmas post. I just needed outsiders opinions to kickstart what I\u2019ve been feeling for a while now.", "Yep. I just made the reply on another comment that we\u2019re fixing it by 2024 or I\u2019m moving home. This post just made me realize it including working on myself the past few weeks that I play in a role in my own suffering\u2026 I started with some family members now it\u2019s his turn. Gotta make that decision!! Thank you \ud83d\ude4f", "I feel like anyone would be offended if their partner changed plans last minute to have Christmas with their parents and not even invite them, expecting them to just be alone on Christmas.", "You\u2019re completely right!!! Thank you for the insight that I was wrong on this. It\u2019s so easy to hop on troll bandwagon.", "I\u2019m not but thank you for sticking up for me! \ud83d\ude0a I checked his phone (we both have each others codes and I didn\u2019t check his messages/emails I have no reason too) and he doesn\u2019t even have Life360 on his phone anymore. I\u2019m not upset by that and now I can calm down on maybe being him a complete control freak on life 360 part but not indoor/outdoor cameras. \n\nI\u2019m just uncomfortable having a camera face the living room at all times and other places that seem to know if I\u2019m home or not. That is controlling and weird tbh. He\u2019s still a control freak tho with the other stuff but I\u2019m going to bring up the indoor camera situation tomorrow. I\u2019m just uncomfortable knowing if I\u2019m being watched or not.", "And during all that time has he ever shown these type of behavior before or is this new", "Why in the world are you with a guy who throws pictures of his children in a grill. That's beyond messed up. The \"lol\" at the end is weird. There's nothing funny about any of this. You sound like you don't like him, so why are you with him?", "I completely understand that would be very invasive!", "In the past, that I can remember: \n\n1) Comments on clothes\u2026 he made comments on basic tank tops with vcuts, the type you get from target Walmart. And some cute halter tops with an open back, that weren\u2019t revealing at all,but he says if you bend over you could possible see bra/side boob.  \n\nHe made some other comments on other clothes but all I can recall is rolling my eyes and still wearing them. I even sold some clothes to this girl I know and she said you can wear whatever you want girl, don\u2019t let him tell you other wise. \n\n2) comments on living with him\u2026. a) When we moved in together and got married, we had a lot of stuff. Over the years I have rearranged the kitchen to make all of our stuff work and sell/donate what\u2019s not working for us. He acts like this is a huge deal.  b) I tackled the garage, bought shelves with matching boxes and printed labels on the boxes of what\u2019s inside.  He acted like this a huge deal but it was never gonna get done.  c) when I take clothes we want to sell to a local store (clothes that are worth a few $ before donating) he says I never told you to sell that or I never told you to box up that suit because he don\u2019t want it wrinkled\u2026. It\u2019s a suit that is torn and he doesn\u2019t wear but still was the first expensive suit he ever bought. He said it\u2019s ok to put it in an old suitcase in storage because we need extra closet space and I labeled with a tag on what\u2019s inside that suitcase.    He is  wish-washy.   \n\nSide note: we have been living in a rental house for 2 years now because we are still not set on where to live and make a permanent home. Just trying to make it the first few years of marriage really. \n\n3) I had a best friend in my town who will call him out on his bullshit when I couldn\u2019t / can\u2019t because I cry to her sometimes. I don\u2019t go posting it on Facebook or crying to everyone. We all need someone.  \n\n4) He also feels very threatened of my male friend who I grew up with from my home state. He calls sometimes and occasionally I have him on speaker telling me \u201cI hope you\u2019re happy, living life, not being a hermit, etc.\u201d that friend also fed me during my broke days when I couldn\u2019t afford soup from dollar general. And he was there \u2018to take away something from me\u2019 after I tried to unalived myself but the thing kept jamming and I knew it was a sign from above jamming it\u261d\ufe0f \ud83c\udf0c \n\nHe always says \u201cgo be with him then\u201d but I\u2019m like he has a wife and daughter what the hell are you talking about? I even said \u201csure he\u2019s not the hottest man alive, he even jokes himself he\u2019s a fat old half bald fire fighter\u201d haha. \n\nI don\u2019t know if he feels threatened but I\u2019m always going to thank him for feeding me and helping me during my unaliving moment. I was young and called him for help instead of my parents (I\u2019m an only child, no sister). \n\n5) just now started to notice the weird comments like the window stuff; the short nails but compliments me when I get fake nails; the comments about some clothes that I\u2019ll compromise on.  I even joked the other day when\nShopping for an actual bra, not a sports bra, that they sell bras with the nipple shaped in them already and I showed him then joked saying no way you\u2019d let me wear this and I honestly wouldn\u2019t. Out of respect for him and me.\n\n\nAnd I remind him, when he bitches about the window, that I\u2019m not sorry I don\u2019t want to live in a dungeon or prison.  I have desk near the window but I work on my computer facing the door. I like working in sunshine but not directly at the sunshine and seeing what\u2019s going on outside or else I\u2019ll lose focus.", "Sorry my reply was long. I didn\u2019t list everything else but the harder I think about it, the more I could come up with the stuff that I swept under the rug. Not terrible but like hey I didn\u2019t like that comment or behavior so I took note. I\u2019m not perfect by any means but from my comments on other reply\u2019s, I\u2019m definitely open to my own improvement.  \n\nGonna write all that stuff down I swept under the rug and show it to him,so thanks for that follow up question! \ud83d\ude4b\u200d\u2642\ufe0f first one is calling me a dang tramp for wearing a tank top working in the office. Not ok to use that word because I had the window up!  \n\nThank you for your kindness and follow up questions", "It\u2019s not his children. His parents hate he adopted the kids but they were the first to say you need to adopt them for their religious bullshit.  They are also forcing him to have a connection when they\u2019re adults but they don\u2019t want anything to do with them because he married someone else\u2026. But pays their bills. They\u2019re adults. (Another drama) But his parents turn around and tell everyone else they wish he never adopted them. \n\nI agree it\u2019s too much drama. I believe it\u2019s not worth staying in this marriage probably because it\u2019s always going to be this way. \n\nI\u2019ll admit I started to hate them because of what they said but then I turned around and started to get pissed they say \u201cI wish he never adopted them, I wish he would of went through with his unalive thoughts when he could, I wish he would of took my help to get him to past military test so he can go away, I wish my son don\u2019t have connections with them\u201d it\u2019s just a lot and I realized it\u2019s not worth it anymore.  \n\nI don\u2019t want them saying those things about our kids if we even have them. They deserve more than that. \n\n\nReddit don\u2019t let you edit comments after certain amount of minutes so I get the lol part. It looks fucked up, I know.  I wish I could edit it but I can\u2019t. I wish I could edit the \u270c\ufe0f but I can\u2019t. I meant \ud83d\udca4"]}
