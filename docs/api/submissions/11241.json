{"id": 11241, "submission_id": "11fic4p", "title": "AITA for not letting my girl go to a party", "selftext": "Me and my gf wanted to go to this party and she was really excited about it. But what I have totally forgot is that my step dad has birthday on the same day as is the party. And birthdays can last till 4am where i\u2019m from. Her solution was that we stay until 8pm and then go to the party. But birthday starts at 5-6 pm so I said this would be disrespectful. Specially because my stepdad has done a lot for me. First she suggested that I just ask my parents repeatedly to go until they say yes, and to that I said no because whole family will be there except me (which again seems disrespectful from my end). She then said that she\u2019ll go alone with her friends. Last time she went alone with her friends she got pepper sprayed by a drunk, started to hyperventilate and fainted. I felt terrible that I wasn\u2019t there protecting her. So for that reason I said no don\u2019t go it\u2019s not safe we\u2019ll go to the next one immediately. She was really excited about the party so she said that in that case she\u2019ll go alone with her friends. The thing is her friends are not the best kind of friends some do drugs and some are just depressed anxious people. Basically not the best friend to be around if something happens. For that reason I again suggested we skip this one and go to the next one as it will be pretty much the same as this one. She still wanted to go and was very mad at me at this point. So I gave her the choice. Go but we\u2019re over or don\u2019t go. She can either stay at home or join the birthday (where alcohol and maybe in secret some weed will be both available, because I understand she wants to relax for a bit after few months of hard studying). I\u2019m not controlling and I trust her completely on the cheating part. The problem is I don\u2019t trust the other jerks at the party, and don\u2019t want to feel responsible if something would\u2019ve happened to her.

You could even ask if she'll text you just so you know she got there safe & when she gets back home safely (assuming you two don't live together) but if she says no then you have to accept it; communication is a requisite for a successful fruitful relationship so if you don't want to lose her (and it's not worth losing her over something like this), it's got to be done.\n\nYou'll get a lot further owning your mistake than trying to gaslight or blame her, because remember, YTA here not her.", "NAH, and enjoy your new single life!

But what I have totally forgot is that my step dad has birthday on the same day as is the party. And birthdays can last till 4am where i\u2019m from. Her solution was that we stay until 8pm and then go to the party. But birthday starts at 5-6 pm so I said this would be disrespectful. Specially because my stepdad has done a lot for me. First she suggested that I just ask my parents repeatedly to go until they say yes, and to that I said no because whole family will be there except me (which again seems disrespectful from my end). She then said that she\u2019ll go alone with her friends. Last time she went alone with her friends she got pepper sprayed by a drunk, started to hyperventilate and fainted. I felt terrible that I wasn\u2019t there protecting her. So for that reason I said no don\u2019t go it\u2019s not safe we\u2019ll go to the next one immediately. She was really excited about the party so she said that in that case she\u2019ll go alone with her friends. The thing is her friends are not the best kind of friends some do drugs and some are just depressed anxious people. Basically not the best friend to be around if something happens. For that reason I again suggested we skip this one and go to the next one as it will be pretty much the same as this one. She still wanted to go and was very mad at me at this point. So I gave her the choice. Go but we\u2019re over or don\u2019t go. She can either stay at home or join the birthday (where alcohol and maybe in secret some weed will be both available, because I understand she wants to relax for a bit after few months of hard studying). I\u2019m not controlling and I trust her completely on the cheating part. The problem is I don\u2019t trust the other jerks at the party, and don\u2019t want to feel responsible if something would\u2019ve happened to her.
