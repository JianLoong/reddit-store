I did all the normal things, paid off all dept, emergency fund, savings etc etc. However, my dad was always a huge petrolhead and as such I have grown up to be one. It's because of this I used part of the money to buy an Aston Martin. This will be important later. \n\nNow my girlfriend and I have been together for just over a year, we've been on lots of holidays together and always decide on the budget together, if there are then nicer/more expensive things I want to do I'll pay for them. However if there are things we've agreed to split like plane tickets and she can't pay me right away (which I don't mind) we put it on a tab and she will pay me what she can (usually \u00a3150-200 a month). She currently has about \u00a32.4k on this tab. \n\nNow here is the problem, I've always wanted to go on a car rally. For those of you who don't know what that is, it's when you take a group of cars and drive across countries visiting move places. Well this year I can afford it and have the time off work so I decided off go. \n\nThe rules for this rally are it's \u00a34k per person for the rally all included. However you MUST take 2 people per car, so technically \u00a38k per car. Now due to the cost my plan was to take a friend of mine with me that can afford it, so we pay \u00a34k each. However my girlfriend has said she really wants to go and we should just add her share to the tab and she'll pay me back. \n\nI told her that I wasn't comfortable with her owing me over \u00a36k, because this would take her over three years to pay me back and that's assuming we don't go on any other holidays in that time. When I told her she was extremely upset that I'd go without her and has been off with me since. \n\nMy friends are split on whether I should just pay for her or not and I'm losing my mind.

Unfortunately part of life is passing on things you can\u2019t afford. Just over a year relationship even I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with her owing what she owes you now, let alone another 4K. Right decision", "Good luck getting that 2.4k back", "NTA you guys have only been together for one year and I\u2019m shocked you\u2019ve let her borrow 2.5k worth! It\u2019s totally fine to enjoy solo activities and travel without your partner. I would cringe at even asking that much from my parents for a hypothetical emergency (which they would probably happily loan) let alone for travel \ud83e\udee3\n\nAre you comfortable losing that money if you break up? I had a friend who loaned a boyfriend 10k and\u2026he turned out to be a crazy stalker who never returned the 10k. \n\nYou may want to reconsider how you guys are managing finances \ud83d\ude33 as a woman, I\u2019m a big advocate for separate finances. I\u2019m a frequent traveler that does solo and trips with others but when I want to take a trip with someone, I make sure we are both ok with the budget beforehand. If they are only able to afford much less, I would work with them to scale the trip to their budget not mine.", "NTA. If the other person can\u2019t afford something every once in a while, sure, I\u2019m happy to help cover it. BUT, I wouldn\u2019t have a running tab! \n\nAre you a bank? As a woman, I don\u2019t like borrowing money from men I\u2019m dating. It\u2019s either a gift or I\u2019m paying my way. \n\nThat\u2019s what you should do. Either cover it and call it a day or only do things where she can pay her share. \n\nThat\u2019s a pricey trip and she shouldn\u2019t be pouting because you refuse to finance an expensive trip for her.", "NTA. Rule of thumb: don't give money to family or friends that you expect to be paid back. If you want to gift someone something, go for it. But be cautious about mixing finances and emotional relationships, especially when you're only dating and the payback period is so long. Enjoy your trip, and the two of you can accept that she's not currently in a position in life to participate. That may change in the future, at which point you can go on a different trip together.", "NTA \n\nRally\u2019s are hard. She has to love them. \n\nAlso it may cost more if things go wrong. Unplanned stuff happens when you\u2019re driving a car across rough terrain. \n\nYou\u2019re doing this for your Dad. Go with your mate. Have fun!", "NTA. Also she\u2019s never going to pay her tab.", "NTA - That a lot of money for her the \u201cborrow\u201d in the first year of a relationship and she basically cannot afford to pay it back.  The tab will just keep growing.", "NTA. She can\u2019t afford it and you don\u2019t want to pay for it. End of story. \n\nBased on this conversation, you all should consider talking about your tab experience. If your relationship is going to rely on her paying you back, you need to come up with a payment plan or something similar so that you can ensure that you\u2019re going to get your money back in the future or set a limit to how much she can borrow at one time. If you don\u2019t have confidence that she\u2019ll pay you back the 6K then stop being her tab in the first place. \n\nHave her save up and you can both go on the trip when it\u2019s affordable for the both of you.", "Im a bit torn. Not wanting her to owe you that much and not wNting to pay for her  makes sense but constantly going on expensive trips that she cant afford and just expecting her to sit at home while you do them seems AHish.", "NTA! If you two break up there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t see what you\u2019re owed. But even besides that, you\u2019re allowed to go on adventures with a friend who isn\u2019t your gf.", "NTA. You made the right call. She already owes you way too much and she seems too entitled to your money. Work on getting back what\u2019s already outstanding and don\u2019t front her anymore until she pays that back.", "NTA! Go with your friend and have a blast!", "\u00a32.4k is already a decent chuck of cash to loan anyone you have been dating only 1 year and she wants to add \u00a34k to that tab? Absolutely not! NTA and enjoy the rally.", "INFO: When did you and your girlfriend agree to this tab thing- recently or has it not been revisited and she's just slowly been accumulating debt? Did you put any limits on it?", "NTA: your money, live however you so choose and if you\u2019ve got a mate who can afford to go and wants to, take them! You don\u2019t need to take the girlfriend on every single trip and a car rally? Dude she\u2019ll probably complain the whole time and want to shop or party elsewhere.  She likely only wants to go to keep you in check.  And honestly, I really doubt you\u2019ll get any money back from her if you keep pushing the debt, she\u2019ll use you like an ATM and eventually get bored or you\u2019ll run out of money, then what?", "NTA, she\u2019s your girlfriend and not your wife right? Yes I say keep your tab and if you have a friend that wants to go and can then do it", "NTA - you haven\u2019t been dating that long and for her to owe you the amount of money she does seems like a recipe for disaster. You\u2019re correct in not letting her add more to the tab. It\u2019s obvious she can\u2019t afford things and I don\u2019t expect that you want to support her. It already sounds like you do a lot together. She needs to let you go have your fun with your friend.", "NTA, it's fine to want to go on a trip with your friend and your GF is out of line assuming she can \"borrow\" the money from you indefinitely. But you are a little bit TA for using the phrase \"modest inheritance\" to describe what is clearly a small fortune. Just own it.", "INFO: The Aston Martin may be important to you but why is it important to this story in which it is never mentioned later?", "INFO: Is this car rally holiday something your girlfriend actively wants to go on - like you've always wanted to do it?  \n\n\nINFO: Are you in a LTR with her that you see as eventually ending in marriage,?", "NTA. Take your friend who can afford it.", "NTA. This is something you've always wanted to do and now have the opportunity to. It's your thing to plan how you want. Also, I can't imagine ever expecting a partner of one year to spend that kind of money on me and not ask a single question. I say take your friend.", "NTA. it's your money\nmaybe, she's abusing and using you because she knows you have money ...", "NTA. Your gf can't afford it. Plain and simple.", "For context, it's been a year, where do you see the relationship going? If this is a long term commitment, then the fact that you're keeping a tab means YTA. If this is a long term fling and you're keeping a tab, then well, YTA still.", "YTA. She cannot afford your lifestyle. Either make plans within her budget or cover some of her expenses. Making a relationship this transactional is going to cause problems.", "YTA for constantly choosing trips that aren\u2019t within her budget and blaming her for not being able to afford it", "Nta she can't afford it and that's a bummer but you've already set a dangerous precedent. \n\nBe careful if you plan on getting married to her.\n\nEnjoy the trip with your friend", "ESH. It was pretty clear eventually at some point when my spouse and I were dating that marriage was our future, and started merging our expenses\u2026 (meaning, there was NO running tab for large purchases in either direction) Maybe you haven\u2019t reached that point yet but excluding this person from a holiday strictly because they won\u2019t be able to pay you back tells me you aren\u2019t seriously contemplating a future with this person, (at least not yet) so maybe you\u2019re just stringing her along. At the same time, I can\u2019t see why she just wouldn\u2019t let you go on a trip with just your mates, as she shouldn\u2019t need to live in your back pocket\u2026 I dunno, maybe you need to have a hard think about whether or not you want a future with this person. \n\nedit: ffs nowhere did I mention merging actual bank accounts.", "If you want to be with her you should really do things that you can both afford or pay for them yourself. If you don't want to be with her then I guess this is a good excuse to end things, although breaking up with her would be kinder.\n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nThat's...a lot of money to owe someone you've only been with a year. My best guess is that she doesn't plan on paying you back as she wants to marry you and thinks that once that happens, your money is her money.", "NTA. Does your gf even like cars?? Can she drive? Is she going to want to hang out with a bunch of other gearheads and talk cars for days?\n\nYou need to get comfortable with all of this money that you are gifting your gf because you are never getting it back. That said, keeping track or every penny of what someone paid at dinner...kind of a miserable existence. \n\nCongratulations on the beautiful car. Enjoy the rally. Take someone who will pay their own way and also enjoy it with you.", "YTA - if my partner went in this type of vacation without me, they would be my ex partner", "You have a TAB for your PARTNER. YTA.", "YTA. Full Stop. I don't even keep \"tabs\" for money my friends and/or acquaintances \"borrow\" or \"owe me\". I couldn't imagine doing so to the person who is supposed to be my partner.

I would do that with a one year relationship too\n\nFind a girlfriend with more money mate", "For the question specifically posted here about a vacation involving a car you purchased with inheritance (and my condolences for your loss), NTA.  But others have a valid point that consistently choosing travel she can't afford and having a 'tab' between romantic partners are not good indicators for a healthy long-term relationship.\n\nP.S.  Tell us about the Aston, pretty please?", "NTA. But at some point you will have to decide if this person is someone you want to be with long term and start paying for things.", "This is why I don\u2019t date people with significantly more money and fancier tastes than I have. I don\u2019t wanna feel like I\u2019m holding them back nor do I wanna feel like I\u2019m regularly missing out on experiences together because I can\u2019t afford it. I\u2019d rather take a cheaper vacation we can both afford. If I owed my bf over 2k after just a year together, I\u2019d feel like absolute shit about myself.\n\nI don\u2019t have a vote on whether or not you\u2019re the AH, but sounds like you and your girlfriend need to have a serious talk. Even if she is agreeing to the trip budgets you\u2019ve been setting, she\u2019s obviously agreeing to things she can\u2019t afford if she accumulated that much debt to you in just a year. Either you both need to scale back the number of trips and cost of those trips, you need to start paying for a greater portion of the travel costs, or you both need to be okay with you taking more trips without her. If you can\u2019t agree on a new arrangement, that seems like a fundamental incompatibility to me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
