If she wants to play the martyr, that's on her. You didn't want the thing, she did the thing anyway, then said she sacrificed to do the thing.   You have very little to do with whatever is going on there.", "NTA \n\nHer deciding to make you a meal, after you told her you did not want it, and then her attempting to throw it back in your face after the fact is absurd. It\u2019s not like you told her she had to suck it up and get into the kitchen.", "NTA. You set your boundaries and she crossed them. She sacrifices a lot but it also sounds like she uses it as ammunition when it comes to arguments, especially since she mentioned she never gets the same sacrifices back. She can be hurt, but she put herself in that position because you said no. No means no. But she did it anyways.", "NTA. I'm gonna make a big assumption, but it sounds like your sister has low self worth and derives what self worth she does have through self-sacrificial acts. Why did she insist on leaving the hospital early? Why did she insist on hurting herself to cook for you when you flat out told her not to do that multiple times? Why does she hold her own self-sacrificial choices over your head? Why isn't your compromise to come over on the weekend good enough for her? Why is she mad at you for setting boundaries, whether that's over unwanted food or childcare? It sounds, imo, like she is jealous/angry that you can set boundaries at all when she feels like she can't for whatever reason. I do wonder how her husband responds to her sacrifices - why didn't he tell her to rest instead of cooking or insist she stay in the hospital longer so she could properly recover? He almost certainly benefits from her constant self-sacrificing, but I don't want to outright say he encourages it without more info. Regardless, it sounds to me like your sister needs some help to figure out why she needs to martyr herself constantly and work on that instead of lashing out at you.", "NTA. You told her not to, she did anyway, and then she's mad when you push back. \n\nShe's being manipulative.", "NTA. Good luck with that, it's very hard.", "NTA.

Your sister just wanted to do a nice thing but I get that it can be annoying. But I\u2019m just so confused about why you had to call your sister back and tell her you gave away the meal.

It sounds like you\u2019re making a bigger deal out of this than it needed to be.", "I understand your frustration, but could you have saved it for the next day? It was gifted to you so it became yours to do what you please; however, you also didn't need to announce to her that you gave it away. But if you're tired of saying no and being ignored, I think you've just solved that problem. It was a bit harsh, judging by your sister's reaction. Just expect that she is going to be hurt over this (probably forever) and might pull away, so as long as you accept that, you are NTA. Anyway, the goal was to get her to care less about you and think more about herself, right?", "I\u2019m a bit baffled by this. Your sister wanted to do something nice as a thank you. You felt she should rest instead of cooking. Sister obviously felt well enough to do it and dropped it off.\n\nWhile you aren\u2019t obligated to accept food your reaction seems over the top. I came here expecting your sister brought you steak and your vegan/vegetarian \u2014 instead you seem upset she didn\u2019t accept your advice to rest. On the other hand, you don\u2019t owe her babysitting in return for nice deeds. This whole thing seems wild. ESH.", "Info: did you refuse the meal out of spite?  You talk about how you did not want your sister to put herself out for you. You also describe many hours passing and no mention of having eaten anything.

You set you boundaries, and it is good. Your sister seems to give things with strings attached. No wonder you do not like that. You told her repeatedly you did not want her meal. If she after that went into trouble and made it anyway it is not your fault and you should not be guilt-tripped about this. She should suck it up, she is being unreasonable about it.", "NTA. Your sister, I\u2019m sorry to say, has some emotional stuff she needs to work thru. The over caring and not listening to your wishes is something I\u2019ve seen in my family members with certain mental illness my whole life. It\u2019s so hard to see past the \u201cgoodness\u201d of it because it\u2019s manipulative. \n\nIt\u2019s a weird martyrdom, almost. (\u201cBrought up *other* times she sacrificed for me\u201d\u2026) People like this HAVE to be important to you and do nice things, but when you set boundaries they are upset and lash out. \n\nI always think of it like this: \nIt\u2019s like a neighborhood kid who mows all of the neighbor\u2019s lawns and washes the cars. However, it\u2019s without asking. Kid just does it. Then the kid expects a payment after. So, neighbors are going to start keeping cars in garages to not deal with the unsolicited \u201cgenerosity\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m glad your sister is feeling better, but she needs to respect your boundaries.", "NAH. You are not an AH for wanting your sister to focus on her own health. Your tactic was shocking enough that perhaps it will sink in. It seems like this is the result of a long-standing pattern of conduct between the two of you, and there's not enough information to really judge either of you as AHs.\n\nFirst, it seems likely that your sister's acts of service reflect not merely love, but a kind of one-up-manship that is unseemly. It's like a bit of status-jockeying. \"Look at me, I'm such a saint, I cooked you a meal even though I was in the hospital yesterday and you won't even watch my kids for a couple of hours!\"\n\nSecond, it's not clear how you are showing your sister your love -- she seems to matter quite a lot to you, and you worry about her. Do you tell her that? Do you spend time with her to show her that? Not clear.\n\nWhen finals are over, and your sister has recovered, you might want to have an open conversation with her about how all her acts of service feel to you. If she is doing it to show love, then she should not expect anything in return. If she is doing it with the expectation that you will reciprocate, that is not unconditional love, that is transactional, and it doesn't feel like love to you. It feels like an uncomfortable, and unwanted obligation. You can tell her how much you worry/think about her, and that you love her deeply, but that you have a different way of expressing it. I'd recommend apologizing for your extreme response to her 'generosity,' but maybe the two of you can discuss other ways of interacting that you both perceive as loving.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sometimes we all receive gifts that we don't necessarily want or need to keep. You could have just given it away and never said anything to her at all and just keep doing that. Obviously for her providing you with meals is her showing that she loves you. You might not like the way she shows that she loves you but at the end of the day it doesn't really appear to be hurting anyone and you seem to be overreacting in my opinion. \n\nThere's so many stories on here with people who have such nasty families and then there's this one, a sister who tried to thank you with food.

She likely expected backup for the same reason that she expects you (and everyone) to give her accolades for the sacrificing that she does \"for you\". \n\nExcept, as mentioned elsewhere, it's really not for you. It's for her. Maybe it's how she shows love, maybe it's to one-up you, maybe it's because she only feels value if she's in this caregiver/sacrificer role that she's created for herself, but it doesn't really matter. It's not FOR YOU. She didn't listen when you said you didn't want it, she didn't listen to your distress that she wasn't caring for herself, she didn't listen when you tried to make alternate plans for after your final. She did it FOR HER. \n\nI completely understand where you were coming from in not eating the meal. If I were in your place, I wouldn't be able to swallow this food she hurt herself making, that I knew she was going to shove in my face later as an example of how she loves you more.\n\nIf she wants to do something for you, she can ASK YOU if you want it. And she'd better listen when you say no. She needs to understand boundaries, and that her way is not the only way to do things. Good on you for showing her a boundary where if she drops stuff off that you've said no to, you're going to give it away. Follow up on that. Don't even bother to tell her that you've done it. She'll ask, because she wants acknowledgement, and at that point you just calmly and briefly reiterate that you told her if she did it anyway that you would give it away. Don't tell her who you gave it to. Don't give her any feedback on what anyone said about it or if they liked it. Don't give her any information at all except that you told her what would happen, and it did. Then change the subject. Do not engage. \n\nAnd do make plans to do things with her. Ask her if you can come over for dinner. She'll get to make food for you, you'll get to see her and help with dinner or dishes (maybe bring dessert), win-win. \n\nI hope finals went well!", "Your sister sounds like my mom. I learned a long time ago that I am not going to change her and anything I say will hurt her feelings. She got mad at Walmart last Christmas because I wouldn\u2019t tell her what I wanted. Im 50 btw and my husband and I do pretty well financially and I\u2019ve told her I have everything I need and do not want anything else that\u2019s going to clutter up the house and I won\u2019t use. Anyway back to Walmart -she tried to pay for my groceries & I wouldn\u2019t let her so she got very upset and was about to cry saying I embarrassed her and didn\u2019t need to be mean. By the time we got to the car she had actually called my dad to tell him she didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me but I refused to tell them what I wanted for Christmas and was crying by then. Someone walked by w/a toaster oven in their cart and by then I was frustrated and of course she makes me feel guilty as hell so I told her that\u2019s what I want. She promptly almost running went to grab it and said which one. I said surprise me-that didn\u2019t go over well either so I pointed at the first one I saw. Now I have toaster oven that I don\u2019t care for sitting in a cabinet. It will soon be going to my sister in law. \nIt\u2019s annoying as heck most of the time but I just learned to bite my tongue. Your sister is not going to change her ways. Just take the food and give it to your roommate or whoever and don\u2019t tell her you did. This way your sister is happy and you have some time to do what you need and your roommate is full. \nThat\u2019s really the only way you can do it without fighting with her.", "Trying to build up a bank of unreasonableness credits", "Not at all. I'm just saying you could have delivered the message a bit nicer. I get she's pushed you into your response by being way too up in your business. You got the NTA from me. I do wish you luck with a difficult sister.", "OK but OP is refusing the meal bc they want this pattern of behaviour (sister putting herself out unnecessarily for things that OP didn't ask for and doesn't want) to stop? Sure, maybe OP didn't have to tell sister that the meal went to their roommate, but otherwise OP is just setting boundaries which is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. Sister feeling well enough to make food is not the point (although considering she wanted her husband to tell OP how much pain she was in while making it, i doubt she was actually well enough), the point is that she was doing it despite explicitly being told not to. Even if something is done with good intentions, it's just unproductive when it doesn't make the recipient feel good. At that point you're doing it to make yourself feel like a saint and it ceases to be about the other person at all."]}
