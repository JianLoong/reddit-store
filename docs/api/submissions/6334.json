He is a great person who is appreciated by both my family and my friends and who makes me a better person.\n\nJohn had always been extremely patient and (sometimes too) kind. Which is why his behaviour that I will talk about is bothering me a lot.\n\nFor context: John lost his m mother 3 years ago on the evening of the 24th of December.  My parents and me live in Germany, however my parents are English, so this year, it was decided that Christmas would be spend in the UK, and Ofcourse I invited John.\n\nThe 24th had been a day John always spend with his grandmother. However the tickets were cheaper on the 24th to go to the UK, and even though I proposed to go on the 25th, John told me it was ok to leave on the 24th.\n\nSo we left, the first part of the journey we were at one of my fathers closest friends who just lost his wife, so everyone was in mourning and it was a difficult atmosphere. Also, the \u20182 days family and rest of the time alone time with John\u2019 was reduced to, spending time with one of my family members everyday and having no time for ourselves. Me and my siblings argued, my parents argued, siblings, me and parents argued, it was horrible but John stayed calm and comprehensive.\n\nWe came back in the morning of the 31st, slept and then spend time with some of my friends. John was \u2018ok\u2019, not himself, but not unpleasant. Afterwards we went out, John isn\u2019t particularly for that kind of music we listened to at the party (hardcore metal) but whenever I asked if he was ok he said yes.\n\nAt a certain moment, we went to another party in a small venue, there was also hardcore metal. I know John doesn\u2019t like hardcore metal, I told him before, I told him he could go home whenever he wanted.\n\nHe seemed pissed at a certain moment. Told me he wanted to go home, I told him \u2018Stay for another 20 minutes, make an effort\u2019. This was at 4 in the morning. John then lost it and said \u2018I spend the 24th and 25th with your arguing family, I have done enough efforts.\u2019 I started crying, he told me how he would have wanted to be with his family, which he didn\u2019t express to me before then John left, and in front of my friends he gave me a kiss on the cheek which shocked everyone.\n\nI told him when I came home that in no way did I appreciate him arguing with me in public, that he ruined my bday and that he is a party-pooper for behaving in this way and that I expect him to apologize to all my friends who were at the party.\n\nTl;dr: AITA for telling him he ruined my NYE and to ask him to apologize to my friends?", "created_utc": 1672704036, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101s3xc/aita_for_telling_my_bf_that_he_ruined_my_nye_and/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What kind of mixed messaging is that. He is a saint for holding it together as long as he did.", "So let me get this straight\u2026you took your boyfriend on an unpleasant holiday that started with mourning and continued with constant arguing among your family for a week (when you were supposed to have some quality couple\u2019s time), then went to 2 different NYE parties where he didn\u2019t know anyone but you and didn\u2019t like the music, you told him he could go at any time buuut even though you\u2019d kept him out until 4AM, you pressured him to \u201cmake an effort\u201d and stay longer when he finally had enough\u2026 you\u2019d try the patience of a saint!\n\nIt sounds like this entire holiday has been conflict and stress and him being accommodating, and he finally snapped because you\u2019d promised all night to be accommodating but pressured him when he finally had enough.\n\nAnd now you\u2019re throwing a tantrum because you finally hit the end of a generous partner\u2019s patience and tolerance.\n\nOf course YTA.  You\u2019re the one who owes him an apology.", "YTA. Jesus. Ignoring all of the other bs you and your family put him through: you had just told him to leave whenever he wanted! You knew he wasn't a fan of that genre of music! So when he says that he wants to take you up on the offer and leave, you tell him he's not making an effort?? How short-sighted are you? Or is this just straight narcissism?", "YTA.\n\nPoor John! He sounds like he has sacrificed his own holiday plans for yours,only for yours to be filled with anger/fighting/misery. Then he still went out at NYE with you, only to be dragged around and subjected to loud music he hates. You kept telling him he could leave, and when he FINALLY took you up on that you decided to publicly shame him! He had given you at least 6 hours if it was 4am, how dare you act like he's unreasonable for not giving 20 more minutes!\n\nIt really doesn't sound like you value John very much at all. This entire post is about YOU. You barely mention that he gave up Christmas with his grandmother and that this is a rough time of year for him due to his mother's passing before it's all about you again. Leave this man and let him find a partner that values him at least equally to themselves. Then get some therapy, because you sound narcissistic and entitled, and you're on a great track to end up either alone or in a mutually abusive misery of a relationship.", "YOU:\n>I told him he could go home whenever he wanted.\n\nALSO YOU:\n>Told me he wanted to go home, I told him \u2018Stay for another 20 minutes, make an effort\u2019.\n\nYTA in every conceivable way. You took the man to TWO places playing music that you KNOW he doesn't like. then gave him a hard time when he'd had enough. \n\nGod, you're awful.", "YTA- he ruined your NYE because he wanted to go home at 4 in the morning after spending a whole week with your family and your friends and doing what you wanted throughout?\nWow. \nAnd at a time of year when he is grieving his mother.\nCan't believe your lack of self-awareness. \n\nYou say he makes you a better person? I dread to think what you were like before...", "You win, for today at least, the crown of biggest a h. YTA because John did so much for you, most of it at his own emotional expense, and when he couldn't take it anymore you cried foul and acted like he was the problem.  You said yourself that he wasn't acting himself.  That means stay the fuck home, he needs some care. Instead you needed to go out and he acquiesced due to what day it was and completely burned himself out for you. Instead of appreciating it and going home when it was clear he just couldn't give anymore, you demanded another 20 minutes. When he protested that, you started crying,  then later accused him of ruining the day and demanded apologies for not only you, but your friends as well. What a huge AH move. YTA. Apologize to that man for ruining his holidays as well as the time he normally spends remembering his deceased mother. Apologize for your shitty behavior while you were out listening to music he doesn't like.  And most of all, apologize for not recognizing and responding to his needs, ah. Yeah, I know he could have gone home at any time,  but look how you acted when he tried, at 4AM, to go home. YTA, in case you missed it.", "You are a huge gigantic AH. \n\nHe dealt with your annoying ass family on the anniversary of his mothers passing and a hardcore metal band which he hates, and all he wanted to do was go home and you whined about it? I hope he moves on from you.", "YTA You're a selfish, inconsiderate asshole. I can't believe you had the audacity to demand an apology. John is the one who is owed an apology. But, honestly, I'm just hoping this whole situation ends in a breakup because John deserves better.", "\"I told him \u2018Stay for another 20 minutes, make an effort\u2019.

And you owe him a hell of an apology.", "Congrats you are the ultimate AH of all AHs", "YTA. You told him he could go home and then when he said he wanted to go home you told him to tough it out.", "YTA\nYou dragged him to two parties where you knew he wouldn't like it and then broke your promise of going home when at 4 am this Saint of a patient man finally had enough. Not to mention the whole lot of arguing the week before.", "YTA, really\u2026 a party pooper? Grow up. He has put up with a lot. You said you could go home anytime. I hope you apologise to him", "YTA and hopefully single soon", "YTA. 4 in the freaking morning? Why did you need to stay that late? Is your boyfriend an introvert? If so, then spending so much time with other people over such a short span at a delicate time for him is frankly a Herculean feat. Where was the time for just y\u2019all? Where was the time for him to decompress? If someone you are with signals they want to leave, then you go with them. You don\u2019t pressure them and expect them not to push back.", "Good grief, you are the WORST. Fingers crossed John comes to his senses and finds a girlfriend who isn\u2019t a narcissistic AH.", "YTA - I\u2019m confused, was this your birthday or a New Year\u2019s Eve party? You refer to it as both.\n\nEither way, your behavior was abhorrent. He put up with *a lot* and it was apparently never enough for you. You told him before he could go home whenever he wanted, and when he said he wanted to go home, *you told him to stay longer and tried to guilt trip him by telling him to \u2018make an effort.\u2019\u201d*\n\nHe put up with so much junk for you, and you were never satisfied. He isn\u2019t a doll you can drag all over creation with you, an object that doesn\u2019t have feelings and never complains. Eventually he\u2019s going to get burned out and tired of getting walked all over. You owe him a *big* apology.", "YTA.  You say John has always been patient and kind, so where is your kindness? That whole time will have been difficult for him yet you made it about you and your wants... your family, your friends, your music venue. What about what John wants, especially during a difficult time? \n\nIt sounds as if you are used to getting what you want and your boyfriends needs and wants are an oversight due to your selfishness.", "> I told him before, I told him he could go home whenever he wanted.\n\n> He seemed pissed at a certain moment. Told me he wanted to go home, I told him \u2018Stay for another 20 minutes, make an effort\u2019. \n\nAre you serious? So you lied about him being able to go home whenever he wanted. Of course he snapped, you told him he had an out then took it away when he finally couldn't stay patient anymore. \n\nHe's a saint for tolerating everything as long as he did, what's your excuse? \n\nAnd he sacrificed his holiday for you, and yet that wasn't enough for you. He didn't ruin anything, you did. \n\n> This was at 4 in the morning. John then lost it and said \u2018I spend the 24th and 25th with your arguing family, I have done enough efforts.\u2019 I started crying, \n\nHe is right. Instead of spending time with his family, he had to deal with yours being horrible for the holiday. \n\n> he told me how he would have wanted to be with his family, which he didn\u2019t express to me before then John left, and in front of my friends he gave me a kiss on the cheek which shocked everyone.\n\nUh, he literally spends every year with his family. Why does the obvious have to be spelled out? The fact that he does spend every year with his family and you know that means that he has been expressing for as ling as you two have been together. \n\n> I told him when I came home that in no way did I appreciate him arguing with me in public, that he ruined my bday and that he is a party-pooper for behaving in this way and that I expect him to apologize to all my friends who were at the party.\n\nHe sacrificed his holiday. You pooped his party, and your family arguing ruined it. He's had to tolerate a bunch of bs, he's the only one who is an innocent party in this shitshow. YTA\n\nYou basically tormented him and made him suffer and got upset that he finally had enough of you ruining his entire week and his family time. You snapped him. You are the one who owes an apology.", "YTA - not just for asking him to apologize but it sounds like you were in the wrong to me. He put up with so much for you with your family and then he wanted to go home at 4 in the morning which seems very reasonable, especially since YOU told him that he could leave at any point. I\u2019m not surprised that he finally had enough when you told him to make an effort. YOU are the one that needs to apologize to him.", "YTA. A very selfish, inconsiderate AH.", "YTA. I see why all your other relationships were \u201cunstable\u201d. It\u2019s you. You\u2019re the problem it\u2019s you.", "YTA\n\nHe did everything you asked. And you lied to him saying he could go at any time & then saying je should stay another 20 minutes (Was it just 20 minutes?) & then you DIDN'T leave!! WTF?", "YTA\n\nHow is this a question? \"I told him before, I told him he could go home whenever he wanted.\"\n\n'I told him \u2018Stay for another 20 minutes, make an effort\u2019. ' \n\nJust one of the screwed up things you've done. No matter how you spin it, you're TA. \n\nWhat the hell OP. YOU should apologize to HIM.", "Maybe I'm wrong here but yta, you stated that sometimes John is too nice. I believe him putting up with/ going with whatever you wanted this holiday was him doing just that. And he reached his breaking point. At no time did you really consider what he wanted and when he finally said he wanted to leave, you dismissed him by saying \"make an effort\", are u joking?? He had been making an effort the entire time and finally wanted to leave. But he's an asshole and needs to apologize to not only you, but your friends aswell? No. I'm my opinion that's wrong.", "YTA you knew he was uncomfortable.  You also said he could leave when he wanted.  When he attempted to you tried to get him to stay longer.  Why say he can leave when he wants if you didn\u2019t mean it??", "YTA. It sounds like his feelings were brushed aside the entire holiday, he agreed to be with you and your family for everything, and then at 4 AM in the morning he wants to go home and you want him to stay longer. I\u2019d snap too. No you can\u2019t read his mind and sure he didn\u2019t say anything out loud but come on. He isn\u2019t a party pooper for wanting to go home at 4 in the morning, after most likely thinking about his mom and family the entire time. You should be the one apologizing to him.", "YTA - he wanted to go home. After all the things he prioritized for you , you ignored his one damn request! Grow up", "YTA 4 fucking AM, with music he didn't like, after a Christmas that sounds awful. I'm surprised he stayed as long and reasonable as he did. The self centered attitude comes though loud and clear. I hope John comes to his senses.", "YTA. You can leave anytime you want. I\u2019m ready to leave. No, stay another 20 minutes. Your man is a saint. You? TA", "YTA \n\nA funerial, constant fights, and shitty music. That is a horrible vacation.  Is John okay?  Talk about need a vacation to recover from vacation!", "YTA. he gave up time w/ his family to go on this trip, assuming it would be fun & take his mind off the anniversary of his mothers death. he was then met with the worst trip i\u2019ve never heard of. he had no time to breathe. no alone time. had to listen to your family argue MULTIPLE TIMES. you said yourself it was horrible. he listened to music he doesn\u2019t like for HOURS. you told him he could go home whenever he wanted, then when he wanted to go home AT 4AM you made a big deal and told him he wasn\u2019t \u2018making an effort\u2019. he even gave you a kiss before leaving. this man deserves so much better. you\u2019re the biggest asshole.", "Yeh YTA clearly. Hope John finds someone more empathetic.", "YTA.\n\nJohn put in alot of effort and work to be there for you this holiday and for your birthday.

He did everything you wanted and you're acting like a child.", "YTA. \n\nThis man bent over backwards for you. And you literally told him, \"if you don't like it leave whenever you want\" and then shamed him for doing EXACTLY what you told him he could,  and should do. \n\nI hope he dumps your ungrateful ass and that you both find the partners you deserve", "YTA and you owe him an apology. He has done everything for you.", "YTA. He spent a ton of time with your family and was out with you until 4am on NYE, during a time of year that is difficult for him. He made more than enough effort.", "YTA. \n\nYou told him whenever he wants to go you can. At 4 in the morning having not spent any time around the music/atmosphere he wanted to be around he asked to go and you told him no.\n\nOn top of that he was calm and pleasant over Christmas even though he had turned down seeing his aunt as it\u2019s a difficult time for them both.", "YTA\n\nThis guy has already gone above and beyond making an effort, and was most probably (and understandable) at the end of his tether. You asking him to stay another 20 mins at 4am was way out of line. There\u2019s a good chance he waited that long in the first place so you could leave together and have some alone time which you hadn\u2019t had since you got there. \n\nHe needed you after doing things for you all week despite his own grief at a difficult time, and you pushed him too hard and let him down. He doesn\u2019t need to apologise, you owe him a big apology with no \u2018buts\u2019.", "YTA. You lied and you trampled his boundaries. \n\nFor everyone else's reference OP has posted this on lots of subs and it DEFINITELY worth knowing her bf has been an orphan since 6 YEARS OLD and lost his adoptive mother since she left it out of this post", "YTA like soooooo the spoiled ass petty privileged AH and may you have the year you deserve and he find the girlfriend HE DESERVES because that is not you. You are penance for past perceived sins. So gross.", "YTA.  Have you ever compromised to make your SO happy, or is it always about you?", "YTA. \nAt 4am you told him to stay for 20 more minutes? At midnight I turn into a pumpkin.", "YTA", "\nYTA for pushing him to stay when you knew he didn't like the vibe, and also you are selfish for not having reached a compromise so that you both enjoyed the night.

And he has NOTHING to apologize for. You on the other hand\u2026\n\nSounds like he\u2019s put up with enough. Just that trip was enough. Other partners may have just left and said no more when it came to family fighting. The NYE\u2026 your birthday, I\u2019m guessing as you mentioned it\u2026 you claim to say he can go home at any time. But when he actually says it, you turn around and said \u201cstay another 20 minutes, make an effort.\u201d You obviously saw he didn\u2019t want to be there and since you offered him an out, he took it. Then you went back on your word. That\u2019s crappy. If anyone should be upset and feel his time has been ruined, it\u2019s him.\n\nHe went to your family\u2019s for holiday. He had to listen to you and your family argue. You take him out to venues that he seems uninterested in. You went back on your word of having him leave, and then selfishly told him he ruined your birthday. Your story screams \u201cme, me, me\u201d all over.\n\nHe sounds like a classy, selfless person. At least he kissed you before he left instead of pouring a drink over your head.", "YTA - your partner put up with the whole night till 4am.

You keep using brief examples of supposed outs you were giving.

I found that to be nice even though he was upset with you.  It\u2019s him saying I love you, we\u2019ll talk later and leaving. That\u2019s how I interpret that.

You even knew that he wasn't acting like himself. *That is a sign that he is suffering.* Why in the blazes did you then drag him out to not one but two different venues full of music that you knew he doesn't like?!? That is the time to stay home with him, be extra kind to him, and ask him what would make HIM feel good to do. \n\nYou didn't. What's more, once he yet again forced himself into a bad situation for your sake, you lied to him. You didn't say \"Would you like to leave? I'll go with you,\" and then do it; you said \"YOU (implying 'by yourself, while I stay here and party with you') can leave whenever you want.\" And then you didn't even mean it. When he tried to accept the extremely minimal offer you made him to be allowed to take care of himself if you wouldn't take care of him, you told him not to and implied that he hasn't been making an effort. He's correct: he's been making nothing BUT effort to tolerate your selfish demands for a full week. Probably for a lot longer than that, but that's the information we have. \n\nApologize to him, and go to counseling if you want to keep him. He needs to learn how to speak up for himself to you, and you need to learn how to be a respectably kind girlfriend.", "YTA, seems quite unanimous.\n\nYou want him to apologise to your friends because YOU started an argument by implying he hadn't made an effort.

He is a great person who is appreciated by both my family and my friends and who makes me a better person.\n\nJohn had always been extremely patient and (sometimes too) kind. Which is why his behaviour that I will talk about is bothering me a lot.\n\nFor context: John lost his m mother 3 years ago on the evening of the 24th of December.  My parents and me live in Germany, however my parents are English, so this year, it was decided that Christmas would be spend in the UK, and Ofcourse I invited John.\n\nThe 24th had been a day John always spend with his grandmother. However the tickets were cheaper on the 24th to go to the UK, and even though I proposed to go on the 25th, John told me it was ok to leave on the 24th.\n\nSo we left, the first part of the journey we were at one of my fathers closest friends who just lost his wife, so everyone was in mourning and it was a difficult atmosphere. Also, the \u20182 days family and rest of the time alone time with John\u2019 was reduced to, spending time with one of my family members everyday and having no time for ourselves. Me and my siblings argued, my parents argued, siblings, me and parents argued, it was horrible but John stayed calm and comprehensive.\n\nWe came back in the morning of the 31st, slept and then spend time with some of my friends. John was \u2018ok\u2019, not himself, but not unpleasant. Afterwards we went out, John isn\u2019t particularly for that kind of music we listened to at the party (hardcore metal) but whenever I asked if he was ok he said yes.\n\nAt a certain moment, we went to another party in a small venue, there was also hardcore metal. I know John doesn\u2019t like hardcore metal, I told him before, I told him he could go home whenever he wanted.\n\nHe seemed pissed at a certain moment. Told me he wanted to go home, I told him \u2018Stay for another 20 minutes, make an effort\u2019. This was at 4 in the morning. John then lost it and said \u2018I spend the 24th and 25th with your arguing family, I have done enough efforts.\u2019 I started crying, he told me how he would have wanted to be with his family, which he didn\u2019t express to me before then John left, and in front of my friends he gave me a kiss on the cheek which shocked everyone.\n\nI told him when I came home that in no way did I appreciate him arguing with me in public, that he ruined my bday and that he is a party-pooper for behaving in this way and that I expect him to apologize to all my friends who were at the party.\n\nTl;dr: AITA for telling him he ruined my NYE and to ask him to apologize to my friends?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "You are really self-absorbed, every event is about what you want to do not what you want to do as a couple. Did you ever ask him what he wanted to do for Christmas or NYE? Or if he wanted to do anything to commemorate his mother?\n\nAlso, your family is a mess. It's not normal to spend 2 days arguing. YTA, apologise and start thinking about him for once.", "YTA", "Hard to believe that this is a sincere post, but in any event YTA and at 4AM there are only two legitimate requests:\n\n1) Please go see why the baby is crying\n2) Please let me sleep", "YTA.  John spent the entire vacation doing what you want, putting up with your arguing family (a very stressful situation to sit through), then stayed out with you at a hardcore metal club until 4 AM, and you told him to \u201cmake an effort\u201d?  C\u2019mon.  John finally lost his patience at 4 AM, at a party with music he hates, after being incredibly patient for the past few days.  And his response to you was extremely mild.  He told you he\u2019d had enough, kissed you on the cheek and went home.  In what universe does he owe you and your friends an apology for being tired and wanting to leave at 4 AM?  If you want to keep this relationship, you need to be more considerate of him.  Him being polite and patient doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s happy or having fun.", "YTA. \nIt sounds like a perfectly horrible time for poor John. \nHe goes with you to the UK in the anniversary of his moms death. \nYou and your family are incessantly arguing in different combinations all through even though you had a houseguest\nYou took him to NYE parties where they played music you knew he disliked, told him he could leave whenever he wanted and when he said he was ready to go you told him to stay longer\nHe finally lost it 7 days into the visit and complained but kissed you on the cheek when he left you \nYou expect him to apologize to you?\nRun John, run.", "\"You can go home whenever you want!\"  \n\"It's 4am, I want to go home.\"  \n\"You're not even making an effort!\"", "YTA.

YTA.", "YTA \n\nYou subjected him to family squabbles, music most adults have grown out of, time where you visited with family and friends and he was treated as a tagalong.  At no point do you mention making him a priority.\n\nYou owe him an apology and a week of his life back.  You suck!", "YTA. I\u2019m also really confused that you say both your parents are English, so presumably English must be one of your native languages, yet your English is very broken. I question if this is real.", "YTA\n\nJohn sounds too good for you. Hopefully he realises that he is and breaks up with you. Poor guy.", "YTA. John deserves so much better.", "YTA\u2026.

That man is a saint. I hope his next girlfriend treats him better than you do.", "YTA", "YTA and if you always behave like this it is no wonder this is your most stable relationship.

He made a damn effort, and you completely took him for granted.", "YTA, all the way. Surprised he put up with it as long as he did.", "How can you type all of this out and still not think YTA? Some self reflection is definitely needed. \n\nHave fun losing the most stable relationship you\u2019ve had. Perhaps it has lasted this long because John is (sometimes too) kind.", "YTA, OP...and a monumentally inconsiderate girlfriend, to boot!\n\nSo basically, your post comes down to the following points:\n\n1. He gives up his time with his grandmother to fly to the UK with you\n2. He has to endure what I'm certain was *a very painful reminder of his loss* by spending time with your father's friend and all the mourning which went with it\n3. He gets to endure day upon day of arguments and hostility surrounding him, in a foreign land\n4. He gets dragged off to endure a ton of music which he cannot stand, only to go to another venue with MORE OF THAT SAME MUSIC\n5. You tell him that you both can leave any time he is ready...***but when he tells you he's ready, you BLOW HIM OFF***\n\nLady, it's a Christmas miracle that you're not single right now.

IMO, John is a goddam superhero for putting up with as much as he did before finally reaching breaking point. And even then, it sounds like he handled it with a lot of grace, and even still kissed OP instead of just storming out. I can say with certainty that I wouldn't have been anywhere near as composed. OP is the AH queen.", "This. All of this. And yes OP, YTA", "OP is unbearably selfish. YTA \n\nAnd  GTFO with \u2018apologise to my friends\u2019, you delusional spoon.", "If someone told me to \u201cmake an effort\u201d like that at 4am I would burn the world down. This guy must be a saint and deserves much better treatment.", "It feels like something like this is usually inevitable for people like OP\u2019s BF. They are so considerate, understanding, and accommodating that people forget that they are humans too and start taking advantage of them. Thinking \u201coh, they\u2019re okay with everything. There no point in thinking about their feelings!\u201d", "The man is a saint. I don't think I would've put up with a fraction of what this poor man endured. I hope he comes to his senses and runs!", "This should be much higher", "OP is the Main Character in  her life, what\u2019s the point of being considered to her bf        /s", "YTA. That was the clincher for me. OP simply told her boyfriend that he could go at any time, but it was just to mollify him. And because he's so patient, he just put up with it until he simply could not put up with it anymore, at which point she turned on him. I'm glad he supposedly made her into a better person, now I wish she would demonstrate some of that. Yikes.", "This was bad enough even if it had been before midnight or whatever, but at 4 IN THE FUCKING MORNING??? She\u2019s insane.", "That confused me, too. She didn\u2019t mention it being her birthday until near the end. \n\nEither way, YTA, OP. He literally did everything you wanted for days, including spending the (pretty recent) anniversary of his mom\u2019s death with you. \n\nYou may not know this if both your parents are living, but the holidays can be extremely hard for those of us who\u2019ve lost one or both. So can their death anniversaries. To have them at the exact same time has got to be emotionally draining. But he still bent over backwards for you, going to your family\u2019s events, going to shows with music he hates, staying out until 4 am after traveling/being away from home for days. And you STILL think he owes you an apology. No. If anyone is owed an apology, it\u2019s him, from you.", "At 4a. She told him \u201cjust 20 more minutes\u201d at 4a. \n\nAnd after typing all that out wonders if she\u2019s the asshole. Yeah, YTA.", "Yeah it won\u2019t last long, not one person is gonna say NTA she is 100% the AH", "And she expects him to apologize to all her friends!!!\n\nI truly hope that John breaks up with OP as he deserves so much better.", "90% chance if it wasn't with her friends/family she goes home with another man because 'he wasn't there and she was drinking'", "At 4 am too!  Let the guy leave.  YTA.  Hope he finds someone with a sensitivity chip and emotional intelligence.", "Maybe???", "The lack of self awareness is quite astonishing.", "The 4am part is what majorly gets me. I went to bed at like 1130. F all op and her bullshit.", "I'm not understanding why the kiss on the cheek was so shocking to her friends.", "I feel bad for him. This is how kind men get turned bitter..", "Yum!", "I got ya, silver award given", "The WAYYYYY I just absolutely cackled at delusional spoon", "That guy is a saint. After being shown that level of disrespect and inconsideration, I\u2019m just awed by the fact that he just vented to her and left with a kiss to her cheek instead of ending the relationship with her.", "Exactly. YTA op. That man went several places and put in lots of effort.", "She shouldn\u2019t have just let him leave damn if it were me and my partner had just done all this for me, the second he or she wanted out or it wasn\u2019t still their scene, I would be back home with them and they\u2019d be getting unlimited back / shoulder / neck rubs so they knew how appreciative I was for all their support . This op is so immature and such an Ah it\u2019s awful - and the whole thing about the liss on the cheek \u201cshocking\u201d everyone ? Wtf ?", "Maybe because her behavior was so abhorrent they were shocked he still liked her? \ud83d\ude02", "And had to be at a place with mourning when 3 years later you're still not over a missing parent, especially the holidays. Mourning, fighting, bad music and 4 am. Plus told him he could leave and then wouldn't let him.", "Some people have no empathy, *cough OP*"]}
