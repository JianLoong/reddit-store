We planned that he would move down there after school and obtain work - and I would follow after I gave birth. My parents convinced me to stay with them in New York City and I broke the news to him. He was furious and abandoned his responsibilities COMPLETELY! He stopped talking to me for quite some time. Thankfully, my parents spoiled my daughter - however it was to the point where she felt entitled. Still, because of them I didn't truly feel the extent of his abandonment and lack of financial assistance.\n\nOur daughter is 17 now. Over the years, I've tried to file for CS numerous times but had no luck. It was either I didn't have an address for him, he could not be located or the job that he did have, he no longer worked there. Eventually, I gave up with filing and would just ask for assistance here and there - but never hounded him. About 85% of the time he would make an excuse why he couldn't help and I would just let it be. I filed for child support again in Feb/March of 2021 and thankfully the court served him by other means so I avoided the whole sheriff/server process in North Carolina. After numerous hospitalizations and severe pain, I've been diagnosed with Chron's Disease, which I expressed to him thinking that would make him want to help out. It didn't, lol. He had a wedding and honeymoon to plan for so our daughter \"had to wait\". Luckily, I am comfortable right now but as treatment and the cost of living continues to increase while income decreases, it's only fair he starts to contribute (not like I haven't had this conversation with him before prior to diagnosis). \n\nFast forward, we had our first hearing which weirdly he expressed no issues with \"stepping up and paying child support\".

Ultimately he's left with $900 per month because he also has tax debt (IRS) being garnished (he claims). He sent a long paragraph condeming me - but also said if I close the child support he will send $600 per month because he believes that's all our daughter needs. \n\nI said NO.\n\nEDIT: AITA for filing for CS and putting him in a \"financial hardship\" and not accepting his $600 per month counter offer?", "created_utc": 1674903575, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ncitf/aita_for_filing_for_child_support_and_not/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter is an adult, you have no need to communicate with him directly.", "Nta. You dont have to accept the counter offer, the courts looked everything and determined that was the monthly price not his offer to pay you a third of it. He had 17 years to financially contribute to his child. Had he have done that then he wouldn't be in arrears 16k.  His responsibility caught up to him and now he has to acknowledge it.

There is now counter offer. He's had enough time, 18 years including the time you were pregnant to plan and prepare for his. He actively chose not to.

NTA make him pay every penny", "NTA at all. He skipped out on his responsibilities for all these years and now he is going to have to catch up. And if you did drop the child support and accept 600 per month he would stop doing that because what he is asking you to do is forgive the child support all together. His obligation disappears then. As far as what he believes his daughter needs if he was concerned about that he would have been sending support all along.

He was boasting so much online, overlooking that his daughter and him are \"friends\"and she could see it. \n\nShe definitely sees the person he is - still, I don't ever bad mouth him in front of her, I let her form her own opinions and we talk about her feelings.\n\nHe's very selfish and it sucks she has to be subjected to that. \n\nI definitely won't back down - and I'm glad you won in court.", "Yes, counting from September 2021 I believe. It was a paternity case first transferred to child support. He's extremely lucky and I've been extremely foolish. Thankfully, I know better now.", "Exactly! I'm glad the courts did because he would solely offer what he thinks she's deserves, lol", "It doesn't even come close. You are absolutely right. I'm done second guessing.", "She's still owed the money, even if her current medical needs are the catalyst for her intensifying her efforts to get it.", "I think it's more a case of having no money to buy their child anything, Crohns is crippling physically, so she's probably not working. But that's reading between the lines. So I may be wrong.", "I have filed child support more than once which would get dismissed, I think I mentioned that above as we live in two different states. I filed CS again in 2021 because I am no longer working and where I perhaps might fall short, I would hope that he would want to contribute towards our daughter's needs.\n\nHis CS contributions wouldn't cover medical bills - and rent alone is over double his obligation.

Parents need their health to parent.", "Yeah he did and I'm the fool for even having an ounce of consideration towards the CS amount.", "Exactly! There's been times I've offered him to just purchase her necessities or supplies and have it shipped down, there would be no need to give me cash. He couldn't even do that. This was after asking for $200 a month YEARS ago, which was still too much. One year, I only asked for school supplies and still didn't get it.\n\nI didn't want to seem vengeful because I don't care, now I don't care what he thinks.", "Yes! ESH for sure!

Here in New York, it's not 18, it's 21.\n\nI've provided him with parental rights. Even though he didn't contribute financially to her upbringing, I've never prevented him from seeing her. I'm not that kind of person.\n\nShe's ONLY ever spent one summer with him at around age 8/9 I believe. However, the first 5/6 years of her life he was non-existent.

Sometimes, the custody/support order will establish back support as well.  I am skeptical that North Carolina is any different. \n\nThe arrears repays the money that has already been paid out for supporting the child.  It is essentially the repayment of a loan. \n\nIn terms of the current support, paying the rent and the grocery bill is supporting the child, no? \n\nParental rights, a/k/a visitation has never been formally/legally tied to child support.  In other words, holding up visitation isn't an excuse to not pay cs.", ">you haven't provided him any parental rights at all by the sound of things\n\nThe dad walked out of her life to another state and went no contact just because she decided to stay in NYC for a bit longer. Sounds to me like it wasn't OP that was standing in the way of his parental rights. And in most states that I'm aware of, you have a kid and run out of the picture, child support is due, regardless of how long the stipulations may be. And as she is in NYC and the child was born in NY, would not New York laws apply here, not NC? And her medical conditions ABSOLUTELY play a role. SHE may not get money, but it proves a state of income due to disability and child support can be adjusted based on that. \n\nNot sure where you get OP sucks based on that.", "To be honest, out of 17 years if I had to guess how much I've received from him to support her, it would be less than $2500. So there's his credit, lol.\n\nUnfortunately, that's the case.\n\nSpecifically he asked \"so if I stop working, I get locked up right?\". So, I know where this is heading.", "My parents*. He moved to North Carolina to go live with his parents and find work. You are right because even with the temporary custody order, he wasn't paying it on time.", "I'm in New York, it's to age 21.

All but two payments were late so the judge stated she's going to forward it to Child Support Enforcement Unit to have his wages garnished, which then comes to me on a debit card. At one point I did consider to have it lowered but then I realized it was calculated at 17% of his income, which is the state obligation - meaning I'd be doing him a favor. If 17% of his income results in an obligation amount of that amount and he's now complaining he can't afford it. It's proving he's been living above his means - considering he has a child to take care of.", "You\u2019re a great mom and I\u2019m glad you are doing good! Sounds like you did everything right!

I am not working and haven't been able to hold a F/T job since 2019. That's why I had to prove to the judge my diagnosis, hospitalizations and treatment plan. The savings that I do have, that covers medical bills, rent, food, etc. as well as ALL of our daughter's needs is getting depleted as each day passes. It's only right that her Dad helps with contributing to our daughter's needs.

Don't give in, and let him know that you will go for it with all means available. Good luck!", "Still, 3 years is not that much time. You've been doing this for 17 years. Send him a small violin lol.", "That is a different situation than what is going in here.\n\nIn that event, if no custody order is established in NC until dad is located and brought to court, then the 3 year statute applies.  \n\nWhat OP is describing is that she obtained a support order early in the child's life,  then spent years chasing him by utilizing the interstate compact that requires states to recognize and enforce child support orders from other states.\n\n  NC can't modify another state's support order or the arrears owed, but can garnish wages based on its own laws regarding the limits that can be garnished.", "I definitely won't! Thank you.", "You are right, I can't argue that. \n\n3 years of CS vs. 17 years of CS, still in his favor.", "Yup, and it's not even like he's paying full freight like you've been for 17 years. He's just paying what I assume the court deems \"half\" of what's necessary. Plus he has a wife... I assume she has income too that she can combine with his to make sure he can make the payments while still being able to afford to support themselves.\n\nMeanwhile you have a chronic illness and I presume are a single mother (correct?). It's not up for debate. He needs to help out. And that's why stuff like child support exists.", "Yes, I am.\n\nI think he was the breadwinner, quite possibly the reason he said it's causing problems between them.\n\nCourt ruled based on the states obligation of 17% of his income. Therefore if he's paying that for 17%, he truly needs to rebudget his other expenses.", "NTA He deserves all of that. Don't give up. Get everything paid.", "NTA. You made him show his true colors when things didn't go the way he wanted while you were pregnant, and you were lucky to get out of that relationship. Clearly he is spiteful and dishonest, and I have zero doubt that if you pulled out of the legal agreement he would do his best to make sure you could never pin him down again.", "NTA. He had 17 years to figure out how to pay his child support obligations but chose not to ever man up. My ex (who I do not have children with) had a child with someone he had a one night stand with while too drunk to remember. He was hit for back child support for 15 months when he only became aware he might be a father when she was almost 1. I mean, there was no denying it, the child looked like his mother so much it was startling, but not knowing he was a dad wasn't an excuse to not be put in arrears... so your ex showed continuous poor decision making and now he suffers the consequences. He sounds like he is suffering a lot of self inflicted poor choices. Tesla payments? Tax garnishment? Sucks for his wife she hitched herself to this winner...", "Well atp no reason to keep filing for CS if she is 17 about to turn 18 once she is 18 CS can\u2019t help you no more but NTA for wanting to make him step up and pay", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you accept?", "NTA.

Not your problem.", "Sounds like your kiddo will have a nice after high school fund to start her life. It's the least the deadbeat could do. He took off to tailor make his life and left you two in the dust. Your daughter deserves that money and his hardship is one of his own making. Do not feel guilty because he never once thought of either of you during the past 17 years. He can downsize, no one NEEDS a tesla, there are options he just rather bring you down in hopes that you'll submit, Don't. Best of luck to you and yours.", "Wait correct me if I\u2019m wrong but doesn\u2019t the court eventually stop allowing you to file for CS if you keep filing because it\u2019s starting to look like you are greedy and going after the money for yourself and not the child.", "Fuck you, pay me.\n\nStop communicating with this deadbeat and direct him to your attorney.", "NTA  Aww, poor guy can't make his Tesla payment after ignoring his financial responsibilities to his daughter (and apparently the IRS) for the past 17 years.  The tiniest violin in the world is playing for him.", "Kind of ESH as you abandoned him and chose to live apart after commiting to relocate to a lower cost of living area with him,but lots of time has passed and he should support his child. Too bad he has to sell the Tesla and take a shorter honeymoon.", "Absolutely NTA. He has been ducking out of providing for his child for the past 17 years, and time\u2019s up. It sounds like he got lucky that he is \u201conly\u201d 16K in arrears, as I am positive that is only a teeny portion of what is has cost to raise your child these past years. \nPlease don\u2019t let his tears and whining sway you. His problems are not yours or your child\u2019s. It sounds like he could have stepped up long ago and chose not to.", "This struck me too. My brother's wife has two girls from previous relationships. The arrears amounts they're owed is astounding and despite both being 18+ their fathers are still paying their mom back. His wife sets it aside 50-50 for the girls and for herself (retirement and emergency savings) because she is a SAHM with the younger kids and my brother paid for their schooling and expenses until they became self supporting.\n\nOP was owed far more than $1000/year and he shouldn't complain because he could owe child support until he died if they looked harder at his lack of support.", "Yeah, I stopped communicating with him. He said he's going to file for an appeal or modification, I told him to just let me know when he does. He has direct access to our daughter, however it's up to her to decide if she wants to communicate with him.\n\nHe's let her down soooo many times, I'm afraid that door is now closed.", "Here it's 21. The CS order has already been finalized. He will only have 3 more years to pay - if he chooses to.", "Huh? I don't know about that. The court never stopped me from filing. I filed and attempted to have the sheriff or process server serve him with no luck, I let the judge know that on the case dates. I would essentially have to start the process all over again. Also, having no mailing/residential address or social on file and him using alias didn't help. \n\nEverytime I filed, the attempt to serve was made at different employer. There was time between each filing.", "I have a feeling that he only agreed to the child support because he was under the assumption that he would only be paying for another year until she is 18. He claret Didn\u2019t factor in arrears and to then think you\u2019d accept 600 dollars instead of what you\u2019re entitled to so he can keep his Tesla is astounding. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong, he\u2019s just trying to guilt trip you. If his family have anything to say, it should be chastising him for avoiding his financial responsibilities to his child. If they\u2019re that worried about his car, they can make the payments. NTA", "Where will the $16k go? I don't know how that works. I know technically it should go to your daughter, but u also missed out on 17 years of ROTH IRA contributions as the money u would have used for that was fronted for your daughters survival (that should have been covered by child support). I have no idea how that works. \n\nCould use part of it for trade school or college.", "You could take $1 from him in CS and his wife would still think you are the bad guy. There is nothing the new wife hates more than CS payments. He f\u2019k around, it took 17 years for him to find out.", "I get that but I was 17. We both only knew New York. There's a reason he didn't move with his parents when they first moved to North Carolina. They didn't have a good relationship, the way I had one with my parents prior to getting pregnant. I didn't want to move to North Carolina be alone and struggle. I understand if people think I'm wrong for backing out at the end, but being 17 and pregnant I had to think long and hard about what's best for my daughter and I. \n\nHe didn't lose his parental rights. There was a few times he did visit her and she went one summer with him. He just chose to not be consistent in her life and then his inconsistency became permanent. \n\nWhat should I call it then if he stops communicating with me completely once I give birth? No call, texts or visits? Because he's upset with my decision?", "That\u2019s not what losing your parental rights is.", "Except she was 17 when she had the baby. 17 year olds make impulsive choices and when they realize the harsh reality of the outcome, like what having a newborn is like or how unlikely a relationship with a 17 year old boy is to work out, OP wisely stuck with her parents. He still had rights and had 17 years to exercise them. He didn't. He chose to move with his family knowing he had a baby on the way. He could have figured out how to stay just like OP was supposed to figure out how to move.", "He had 17 years to visit her though and set up regular visits.   That is on him, he knew where she was you do not have to gift wrap a child and have it delivered with singing choir.   I did not read anywhere that you made it difficult for him to have contact with her rather he has been ducking and diving, not understanding the US tax system then that could be why lol.  \n\nEven now because he owns tax he counter off is to pay his child less and keep a higher amount.  Eat cheaper lol \n\nI have know parents do 3 jobs to pay for their kids while they are in the kids life.  This is what I believe is being a parent is about putting their needs first until they are old enough to take care of themselves.", "He did abandon her if he didn't pursue any visitation or contribute to her upbringing. Even if the OP stayed in NYC, he had the option to return or to pursue some sort of visitation to see his daughter during certain times of the year.", "The fact that the IRS is also garnishing his paycheck pretty much proves you wouldn\u2019t see a dime of the $600 if you actually were to accept his counter offer. This dude does not pay his bills of his own volition.", "You did just fine. His complaint to you is silly on so many levels.\n\nWith the garnishment set up, **you** can't change that, they will garnishee and pay according to the court order. You can't change that, the court will have to.\n\nIf he's unhappy, complaining to you won't do anything. The only option he has is to go back to court.", "Yes! Also, he wasn't aware that I stopped working. He probably assumed w/ my previous F/T income he'd wouldn't have to pay that much and he didn't factor in arrears, correct. I had no problems with his family prior to this. His sister even invited our daughter to come spend the summer with her prior to this CS finalization. I doubt that will happen now, because I'm the wicked ex lol.", "It\u2019s paying OP back for the 17 years she supported her daughter alone.", "It should not go to the daughter, not even technically. She was provided for by her mother (and grandparents). The money is supposed to pay the OP back for the portions of child rearing that she paid that were supposed to be paid by the father. The OP can use the $16k for her daughter but it would be both legal and valid if she chose to use it all on herself.", "CS ends at 21. She plans to go to college in the fall, it will help fund tuition, etc. The 16K arrears is added on w/ the current CS. The arrears equals about $500 per month. I have a savings account which 30% goes into. She gets a portion to spend on her choosing and the other helps w/ her basic necessities. If it's already met for the month, it goes into her checking account.", "You aren't wrong for making the best decision for you and your child.", "The unfortunate thing is my ex lies a lot. I don't truly know if IRS is garnishing his wages but that's the excuse he made as to why he couldn't make the temp. child support payments on time.", "Yes, a decked out Hellcat and upgraded to a Tesla and was so proud of that, lol. \n\nTo ease his mind, I even asked him to purchase the items of her so he wouldn't have to send me money - and it never happened, utterly ridiculous.\n\nI've tried to reasonable with him for too long and I've gotten no where.", "Yup! This is the most important information. It's in the system now.", "We both lived in New York all our lives. At that time I was 17 and he's 19/20. He was moving to North Carolina on a whim. His parents moved down there while he was living with a friend here in New York. His relationship with his parents wasn't the best, hence why they moved and he didn't. I didn't want to move to a completely different state with no family, only to struggle as a new Mom. \n\nI agreed to move with him because of love - logic is what made me stay.", "Dad moved to North Carolina before our daughter was born. He didn't sign her birth certificate or the Acknowledgement of Paternity. When I filed child support in 2021, I was told since he's not on the birth certificate and paternity hasn't been established, a paternity case must be done first. The CS case was changed to a paternity case and once paternity was established, it transferred back to a Child Support case in September of 2021.\n\nMy daughter also had an Attorney who interviewed her about her father, the times they've spent together, etc. which was presented in court.\n\nWhen he would come down to New York and visit her (I believe 2/3 times). It was never discussed prior. He would just let me know when he was in town.\n\nHe used alias on documents and used his parents address when I asked for one. However he would let it be known he doesn't live there and it's not his mailing address but to \"just send it there\". I had to hire process servers and try to have the sheriff attempt to serve at miminum six times - at the several job sites he's had. Eventually, I gave up because I was getting no where.", "The order was filed in New York. North Carolina has no jurisdiction. I'm assuming North Carolina and New York are quite different.", "Oh I\u2019ve been the partner who stole their baby boy and then the evil incarnate ex that destroyed his life. Wasn\u2019t until years later and he still had the same problems did they have to face the facts that it wasn\u2019t me, it was him lol\n\nYou have to also factor in that the side of the story they are getting is from you ex and he may not be a reliable narrator. He\u2019s not taken culpability for not being in his child\u2019s life, physically or financially, so I highly doubt he\u2019s taken any responsibility for this either.", "$16k seems hella low \n\nWhat the heck", "See, I'm learning something. I had no idea.", "OP I'm more concerned with you footing the entire bill for 17 years and now not having as much retirement/backup because you were footing said bill. I know it's not the point of your post, but I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "That is an incredibly stupid thing to lie about given that his argument is, \u201cforgive this judgment you have against me. I promise I\u2019ll pay you a smaller amount under the table. The reason I can\u2019t afford to pay you is because I didn\u2019t bother paying  another obligation until the government got a court order to garnish my wages. I totally swear I\u2019ll pay you without one though. Promise.\u201d\n\nDude sounds dense.", "But it has to feel pretty likely between having a Tesla on a payment plan and never doing anything to support his kid financially or emotionally that he'd have IRS trouble too...", "You can't reason with people who are unreasonable. At least you can always know you did the right thing not following him on his move. Imagine being away from your family and close to his clan of questionable moral and responsible choices... you'd be stuck if you established your child as an NC resident and be so far from the people who you needed.", "You can always remind him that if he fails to pay then he can get locked up in jail.....think of how much money that would save on a wedding and honeymoon he cant attend.", "Girl you are in the right and have more patience than me to reply some other (probably) deadbeat dad.", "Yes, lol.\n\nHe did have her for one summer and visited her 2/3 maybe 4 times here in New York, but he's ALWAYS had the ability to communicate with her directly since he wasn't able to or willingly to be there physically. I've never prevented him from seeing or speaking to her - so I'm confused why I'm such a bad person, but of course it's what he's telling them.", "He is - and I'm the idiot for expecting different.", "He claims it's from a tax levy from 5 years ago that's \"hitting hard since he got married\". I mean it's possible but with him, I never know when he's telling the truth.", "I'm disappointed how everything played out w/ me deciding to stay in New York, but I do not regret it one bit. I can't imagine how I would of done it without my parents. I would of most likely been home sick and depressed and that wouldn't be good for either of us.", "They already got married and had their honeymoon, etc. He actually invited our daughter, but she didn't want to go. He hasn't invited our daughter to spend time with him in YEARS but only now for a wedding? That sucks.", "LMAO! I was a bit lost why they were confused - but I wanted to clarify before they came to that conclusion. It's possible they read or interpreted something incorrectly or just think I'm in the wrong. I just rather them have a clear understanding before concluding I'm the asshole here, lol", "Of course it is, didn\u2019t you know everything is your fault? (Sarcastic eye roll). His main concern wasn\u2019t his daughter and her Well fare, it was the impact on his lifestyle. If he\u2019d manned up and been there from the beginning, he wouldn\u2019t be in the position he\u2019s in. As a mother of four sons, if they ever tried to pull this crap, I\u2019d tear them a new AH, not berate the person who has done nothing wrong.", "Maybe those are the lies he needs to tell to keep the truth from his new wife...", "Depressed, alone, home sick, stuck with people who blame you for your partner's shortcomings, risking conceiving more children with someone who doesn't live up to being a dad, can't leave the county much less the state if you got in  a custody dispute. You were like Neo in the Matrix with all the bullets you dodged. \n\nJust remember, if he contributed $200-1600/month for 17 years (assuming from the time she was born to now he had a steadily increasing earning potential), you'd have been able to cope with some income disruption due to your illness (and I understand Crohn's doesn't creep up, so I imagine you coped a long ass time still doing everything you could to look after your daughter) but his lack of support forced you in to be in a less stable financial position because he didn't contribute. $16k is nothing compared to what he owes you for rearing your child throughout her life with nothing but wishes and hopes from him.", "Yup. A Tesla is a luxury vehicle. He can sell it and downgrade to a more modest car until the 3 years is up. The nerve of him to actually use *that* as a complaint to you when you're undergoing medical treatments! \n\nEven if he is the breadwinner, his wife's income can still supplement his. Which is already putting them in a much more financially stable position than you. 17% isn't *that* much. That's not even 1/5th of his income!"]}
