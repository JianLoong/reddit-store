I got pregnant at 17 and gave birth a few months before 18th birthday. We live in New York City, my ex's parents relocated to North Carolina. We planned that he would move down there after school and obtain work - and I would follow after I gave birth. My parents convinced me to stay with them in New York City and I broke the news to him. He was furious and abandoned his responsibilities COMPLETELY! He stopped talking to me for quite some time. Thankfully, my parents spoiled my daughter - however it was to the point where she felt entitled. Still, because of them I didn't truly feel the extent of his abandonment and lack of financial assistance.\n\nOur daughter is 17 now. Over the years, I've tried to file for CS numerous times but had no luck. It was either I didn't have an address for him, he could not be located or the job that he did have, he no longer worked there. Eventually, I gave up with filing and would just ask for assistance here and there - but never hounded him. About 85% of the time he would make an excuse why he couldn't help and I would just let it be. I filed for child support again in Feb/March of 2021 and thankfully the court served him by other means so I avoided the whole sheriff/server process in North Carolina. After numerous hospitalizations and severe pain, I've been diagnosed with Chron's Disease, which I expressed to him thinking that would make him want to help out. It didn't, lol. He had a wedding and honeymoon to plan for so our daughter \"had to wait\". Luckily, I am comfortable right now but as treatment and the cost of living continues to increase while income decreases, it's only fair he starts to contribute (not like I haven't had this conversation with him before prior to diagnosis). \n\nFast forward, we had our first hearing which weirdly he expressed no issues with \"stepping up and paying child support\". Any who, a temporary amount was granted. A few months later, we had our final hearing. He provided his tax return but didn't show up. I had to provide doctors records, treatment plans, tax returns etc. and the final order was mailed to both of us. I get a text a week later that I'm spiteful and vengeful and put him in a financial hardship because his check will be garnished $1600 per month for child suppport (also $16K in arrears). Now, he's complaining that he can't pay his rent, his Tesla payments, etc. and that it's causing problems between him and his wife. Ultimately he's left with $900 per month because he also has tax debt (IRS) being garnished (he claims). He sent a long paragraph condeming me - but also said if I close the child support he will send $600 per month because he believes that's all our daughter needs. \n\nI said NO.\n\nEDIT: AITA for filing for CS and putting him in a \"financial hardship\" and not accepting his $600 per month counter offer?", "created_utc": 1674903575, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ncitf/aita_for_filing_for_child_support_and_not/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He knew he had a child and tried to abandone her en the responsibility. No reason tho show any empathy to him. Sell the tesla and buy a cheaper car. So no, not the asshole at allZ", "NTA \n\nThat money is for you to take care of your common child. He should have been paying all along. He can do like everyone else does-set a budget. Courts do not pull those numbers out of thin air. It\u2019s a formula that is based upon income and physical custodial split. \n\nTake the money, catch up on bills, and put some aside to better your daughters life.", "NTA. I was in a similar position when my ex didn\u2019t pay for YEARS   His lawyer contacted me wanting to know if I would accept a settlement. I said no. After all the years of ignoring our boys because he went off with another woman who told him not to pay it.. I wound up winning and he paid. \n\nWhat got me about your post was that \u201che can\u2019t make his Tesla payments.. too bad. Sell the Tesla. Do whatever you have to do to make those payments buddy. \n\nDon\u2019t back down and don\u2019t let him get to you.

This was 17 years coming to him.", "NTA.  $16k in arrears equals $1k a year.  He's still getting off cheap.  You know he's not going pay you on his own.  Talk through the courts.  Your daughter is an adult, you have no need to communicate with him directly.", "Nta. You dont have to accept the counter offer, the courts looked everything and determined that was the monthly price not his offer to pay you a third of it. He had 17 years to financially contribute to his child. Had he have done that then he wouldn't be in arrears 16k.  His responsibility caught up to him and now he has to acknowledge it. He can  now accept that responsibility or he can enjoy jail thanks to the courts.", "NTA.\n\nThis was overdue by 17 years. These funds will help support your daughter and he can feel how he wants to but he needs to take care of his responsibility which is his daughter.", "NTA. He may have been a high schooler at the time, but a responsibility is a responsibility. He slept on that for 17 years. It's time for him to step up, especially now that you have limited to no income with your Chrohn's.", "NTA: Not even close, he's only 16k in arrears? That's less than 1k a year! He should count himself lucky!", "NTA\n\nHe can sell the Tesla. He basically made a child, then decided his own needs were oh so much more important than the needs of his child. Now he\u2019s driving a fucking Tesla and having a nice wedding and pleading poverty?! Lol! I don\u2019t think so. He needs to pay for his child. He might not think she\u2019s a priority, but the courts clearly disagree.", "NTA for collecting money for your child.", "Nta. This person skipped out on his child and responsibilities. Had he been a stand up guy he wouldn't be facing this and he is obviously slack on all aspects of life. He can downgrade his life style until his debt is paid. He doesn't like that? Well, too bad. There is now counter offer. He's had enough time, 18 years including the time you were pregnant to plan and prepare for his. He actively chose not to. If all your daughter needed was 600, then the courts would have said he needs to pay 600.", "boo hoo poor him, having to pay $1000 per year of his childs life, im sure that $1000 dollars doesn't even come close to a months worth of costs of raising the child, so hes getting off very lightly... NTA make him pay every penny", "NTA at all. He skipped out on his responsibilities for all these years and now he is going to have to catch up. And if you did drop the child support and accept 600 per month he would stop doing that because what he is asking you to do is forgive the child support all together. His obligation disappears then. As far as what he believes his daughter needs if he was concerned about that he would have been sending support all along. Stick to what the court awarded and pursue that by the fullest extent of the law.", "NTA. He abandoned his daughter for 17 years and now complains he can't afford a Tesla? Well, guess he doesn't need a Tesla.", "NTA he is finally being held accountable.", "Info it reads as if you\u2019re going after him for CS to pay your medical bills and rent, not to provide for your child.", "NTA why should you negotiate now when he was completely comfortable offering your daughter crumbs until someone said that\u2019s not enough. If he\u2019d been decent earlier I\u2019d understand why you might work with him on it but no. You owe him nothing", "NTA\nHe got off lucky.", "NTA. Wow, he clearly believes deeply in personal responsibility./s. This money owed to you for raising your child, and the court determined this was the right amount. Paying this now doesn\u2019t change the many years you didn\u2019t have it and the impact that caused. He can sell his Tesla and get another car if he wants to cut costs.", "NTA.  He avoided responsibility long enough.  I agree, it is a lot, but maybe if he stepped up sooner this wouldn't have been necessary", "Um...I'm confused...\n\nYour daughter is 17 now right...?  That means he's only liable for Child support from a certain amount of time backwards (3 years in NC) from when he was served I'm pretty sure up to the day she turns 18...\n\nAlso it doesn't really matter what kind of shape you're in due to all the money coming to you from him is supposed to go towards caring for the child...\n\nSo at the end of the day you aren't going to get much out of him, plus you haven't provided him any parental rights at all by the sound of things...\n\nI'm just completely confused all around by this post...If I had to make a judgment call on this I'd probably just go with this...\n\nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You took the responsibility, and he still wants to back out?", "NTA.  He left you and his parents to raise his daughter and lived for himself.   You don't owe him anything and quite frankly if you let him off the wage garnishment he's just going to \"pay you when he's able\" which is never.   Deadbeats gonna deadbeat.", "NTA. Your ex should have been paying child support, especially if he was supportive of you having the child. And considering your daughter turns 18 in the next year, he only has to pay for child support for less than a year. It's not that much of a hardship. His Tesla payments can wait.", "NTA - He made the same arguments to the court and they determined that their ruling was the amount he should pay. If he doesn't like the number the court came up with, his argument is with the court, not you. If at the point where his wages are being garnisheed and you are getting payments through the state rather than through him, there really isn't much you could do to lower his payments, that system is going to follow the court order not what you say.", "Nope.", "NTA", "NTA, dump the Tesla, he should have paid his taxes. That's on him.", "Thanks. \n\nYeah, I don't know what made me had any bit of empathy when he neglected her for so long. \n\nI guess I didn't want his family to begin blaming me for his \"financial hardship\" as if I set out to ruin his life. Yet, they didn't intervene w/ him being a deadbeat.", "It sounds like he was planning on supporting them and then mom reneged on moving with him, so he basically lost his parental rights to see and raise his child.\n\nHe should still have been helping to pay over the years, but it's not fair to say he abandoned her when they were so young and he moved with his parents and she didn't follow as promised.", "Can't argue with that.\n\nYes! I give her a portion and 30% goes into her savings. I still provide her basic necessities though.\n\nJust sucks it got to this point - and I'm being blamed for it.", "Thank you! \n\nYes, I didn't even know he had a Tesla until my daughter showed me his post \"just bought a car that don't need gasoline\" - an upgrade from his Hellcat. He was boasting so much online, overlooking that his daughter and him are \"friends\"and she could see it. \n\nShe definitely sees the person he is - still, I don't ever bad mouth him in front of her, I let her form her own opinions and we talk about her feelings.\n\nHe's very selfish and it sucks she has to be subjected to that. \n\nI definitely won't back down - and I'm glad you won in court.", "Yes, counting from September 2021 I believe. It was a paternity case first transferred to child support. He's extremely lucky and I've been extremely foolish. Thankfully, I know better now.", "Exactly! I'm glad the courts did because he would solely offer what he thinks she's deserves, lol", "It doesn't even come close. You are absolutely right. I'm done second guessing.", "She's still owed the money, even if her current medical needs are the catalyst for her intensifying her efforts to get it.", "I think it's more a case of having no money to buy their child anything, Crohns is crippling physically, so she's probably not working. But that's reading between the lines. So I may be wrong.", "I have filed child support more than once which would get dismissed, I think I mentioned that above as we live in two different states. I filed CS again in 2021 because I am no longer working and where I perhaps might fall short, I would hope that he would want to contribute towards our daughter's needs.\n\nHis CS contributions wouldn't cover medical bills - and rent alone is over double his obligation. It goes to our daughter and making sure her needs are met.  \n\nThis is the same man, who I've offered to purchase the items for our daughter rather than sending money - and he couldn't even do that.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Parents need their health to parent.", "Yeah he did and I'm the fool for even having an ounce of consideration towards the CS amount.", "Exactly! There's been times I've offered him to just purchase her necessities or supplies and have it shipped down, there would be no need to give me cash. He couldn't even do that. This was after asking for $200 a month YEARS ago, which was still too much. One year, I only asked for school supplies and still didn't get it.\n\nI didn't want to seem vengeful because I don't care, now I don't care what he thinks.", "Yes! ESH for sure! It is amazing how many 'people' here don't see that.", "He's liable for child suppprt from September 2021 we live in New York and he moved to North Carolina. Here in New York, it's not 18, it's 21.\n\nI've provided him with parental rights. Even though he didn't contribute financially to her upbringing, I've never prevented him from seeing her. I'm not that kind of person.\n\nShe's ONLY ever spent one summer with him at around age 8/9 I believe. However, the first 5/6 years of her life he was non-existent. He visited her three times that I can count - his excuse being he lives in North Carolina (which I kind of get).\n\nWe don't communicate much - but he's always had direct access to speak with our daughter. \n\nMy Chron's was only mentioned because it prevents me from working. Filing for Child Suppport was meant to receive a sum that goes towards our daughter's upbringing. Child Support doesn't change nor does it go towards medical treatments. \n\nMy ultimate goal was to make sure our daughter doesn't want for anything.", "Most states require arrears be paid from the date established in the custody order forward and there's no statute of limitations.  Sometimes, the custody/support order will establish back support as well.  I am skeptical that North Carolina is any different. \n\nThe arrears repays the money that has already been paid out for supporting the child.  It is essentially the repayment of a loan. \n\nIn terms of the current support, paying the rent and the grocery bill is supporting the child, no? \n\nParental rights, a/k/a visitation has never been formally/legally tied to child support.  In other words, holding up visitation isn't an excuse to not pay cs.", ">you haven't provided him any parental rights at all by the sound of things\n\nThe dad walked out of her life to another state and went no contact just because she decided to stay in NYC for a bit longer. Sounds to me like it wasn't OP that was standing in the way of his parental rights. And in most states that I'm aware of, you have a kid and run out of the picture, child support is due, regardless of how long the stipulations may be. And as she is in NYC and the child was born in NY, would not New York laws apply here, not NC? And her medical conditions ABSOLUTELY play a role. SHE may not get money, but it proves a state of income due to disability and child support can be adjusted based on that. \n\nNot sure where you get OP sucks based on that.", "To be honest, out of 17 years if I had to guess how much I've received from him to support her, it would be less than $2500. So there's his credit, lol.\n\nUnfortunately, that's the case.\n\nSpecifically he asked \"so if I stop working, I get locked up right?\". So, I know where this is heading.", "My parents*. He moved to North Carolina to go live with his parents and find work. You are right because even with the temporary custody order, he wasn't paying it on time.", "I'm in New York, it's to age 21. He should have and I've tried but he was good at hiding - and had several jobs in a short span of time. It was difficult to find and serve him. Thankfully, I was able to with the last filing.", "I provided the judge proof of his payments from the temporary child support order so that he could get credit for those payments made. All but two payments were late so the judge stated she's going to forward it to Child Support Enforcement Unit to have his wages garnished, which then comes to me on a debit card. At one point I did consider to have it lowered but then I realized it was calculated at 17% of his income, which is the state obligation - meaning I'd be doing him a favor. If 17% of his income results in an obligation amount of that amount and he's now complaining he can't afford it. It's proving he's been living above his means - considering he has a child to take care of.", "You\u2019re a great mom and I\u2019m glad you are doing good! Sounds like you did everything right! You tolerated it longer than I would have!\ud83d\ude02\u2665\ufe0f", "Wow, a hellcat and tesla, but he couldn't pony up some cash for the kid?  Ridiculous.", "You are right. I am not working and haven't been able to hold a F/T job since 2019. That's why I had to prove to the judge my diagnosis, hospitalizations and treatment plan. The savings that I do have, that covers medical bills, rent, food, etc. as well as ALL of our daughter's needs is getting depleted as each day passes. It's only right that her Dad helps with contributing to our daughter's needs. I've also expressed that he can purchase her items instead of sending me money and he refused.", "It's such a total mess, and basically a waste of time at this point...", "It's a statute of limitations issue here...If it takes 17 years to even track down the person that supposedly has visitation rights to the kid NC will only back charge 3 years from the point the legal father is found...", "She's the one that backed out of the agreement to move down with him...\n\nI feel like you overlooked that point...", "$2500 isn't even two months by the courts estimation... Don't give in, and let him know that you will go for it with all means available. Good luck!", "Still, 3 years is not that much time. You've been doing this for 17 years. Send him a small violin lol.", "That is a different situation than what is going in here.\n\nIn that event, if no custody order is established in NC until dad is located and brought to court, then the 3 year statute applies.  \n\nWhat OP is describing is that she obtained a support order early in the child's life,  then spent years chasing him by utilizing the interstate compact that requires states to recognize and enforce child support orders from other states.\n\n  NC can't modify another state's support order or the arrears owed, but can garnish wages based on its own laws regarding the limits that can be garnished.", "I definitely won't! Thank you.", "You are right, I can't argue that. \n\n3 years of CS vs. 17 years of CS, still in his favor.", "Yup, and it's not even like he's paying full freight like you've been for 17 years. He's just paying what I assume the court deems \"half\" of what's necessary. Plus he has a wife... I assume she has income too that she can combine with his to make sure he can make the payments while still being able to afford to support themselves.\n\nMeanwhile you have a chronic illness and I presume are a single mother (correct?). It's not up for debate. He needs to help out. And that's why stuff like child support exists.", "Yes, I am.\n\nI think he was the breadwinner, quite possibly the reason he said it's causing problems between them.\n\nCourt ruled based on the states obligation of 17% of his income. Therefore if he's paying that for 17%, he truly needs to rebudget his other expenses."]}
