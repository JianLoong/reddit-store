I booked the air bnb and hotel. My sister asked if she could pay later, I was fine with this. \n\nBut a week before the trip is when problems start to occur. She still hadn\u2019t paid me, she owed me about $1000. I mention it a few times and she sends me half. She says she\u2019ll give me the other half cash as she a bartender. \n\nWell we go on the trip and suddenly she claims she forgot all of her cards and essentially has no money leaving me to pay for both of us to do anything. I don\u2019t want to ruin my trip so I agree and I believe she\u2019ll eventually pay me back. Now she\u2019s my older sister and I\u2019m the youngest. Im sort of use to my sibling bossing me around but this trip she was being absolutely terrible to me.\n\nI\u2019ve literally never felt so put down in my life, if we got lost it was my fault. She was constantly yelling at me. She said she doesn\u2019t pump gas so I had to pump the gas everytime. One of the places we rented only had one bed, I had to sleep on the couch.\n\nIt honestly was the worst trip I\u2019ve ever been on, I put up with it as I thought arguing would only make it worse.\n\nWell fast forward to the day we are supposed to leave and travel to Amsterdam. She hasn\u2019t packed so I try to wake up early so she\u2019s have time and we can make it to airport. She just goes crazy on me saying she knows when she needs to wake up and to leave her the F alone. Then goes back to sleep. \n\nWell I decide that\u2019s it and I get and Uber and leave. I also turn off my phone. Well not only does she miss the flight but she had no money to leave. She ends up having to call my parents and they have to help. \n\nWell now my whole family is saying how I\u2019m horrible and how I left her in such a dangerous situation. I thought I was finally standing up for myself but now everyone is upset with me and my sister won\u2019t speak to me. It\u2019s really eating me up so I want outside opinions.

She mooched and moaned. She bullied OP (which op played off as being bossy because she is the youngest but really it's bullying).\n\nNow the parents are annoyed because OP didn't foot the cost of TWO missed flights so sister could have a lie in and sister won't pay what she owes.

I just didn't want to believe someone would actually be dumb enough to do something like that on purpose. I mean it's also her vacation ... but still I have my doubts. Could it have been that she was extra pissy because she did forget the money and had to go begging to you for everything she wanted to do? \n\nI just think there is a possibility (although your argument is very valid) that you are wrong and she did actually forget the money. I guess you will find out when you get home. If she can pay you back right away or not", "The main reason I believe this to be the case is because when I asked her why she can\u2019t send me money from her account she said she recently paid off her credit cards so she has no money in her account. Then I asked why she can\u2019t use Apple Pay and she claims her credit card is not working out of the county.\n\nI do agree I maybe should have left some money for the Uber but she missed the flight from oversleeping. \n\nWe\u2019ve been home for about two weeks now, she says she is not paying me because I left her."]}
