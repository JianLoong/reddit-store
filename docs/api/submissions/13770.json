She hasn\u2019t packed so I try to wake up early so she\u2019s have time and we can make it to airport. She just goes crazy on me saying she knows when she needs to wake up and to leave her the F alone. Then goes back to sleep. \n\nWell I decide that\u2019s it and I get and Uber and leave. I also turn off my phone. Well not only does she miss the flight but she had no money to leave. She ends up having to call my parents and they have to help. \n\nWell now my whole family is saying how I\u2019m horrible and how I left her in such a dangerous situation.
