Now you either pull up to a pump, park & lock your car, go inside, and prepay on the pump you're at (like, \"$20 on 7\"), walk back out and you'll be able to pump $20 exactly... or, you just pay directly at the pump on debit or credit.\n\nSome gas pumps won't take your card if you don't have at least $50-100 of room on your credit card anyway, basically to prevent drive offs via a declined $50 charge on a CC with $7 left on its limit, so you'll still have to go in and prepay then. And some places have bad issues with thieves installing janky card skimmers IN the card scanners at the pump, especially around the holidays, largely targeting debit cards\u2014 so prepaying inside is often safer for digital security/if you don't want to get robbed & you aren't using a CC or a gift card for that gas station chain.\n\nSo 30 minutes for OP's case does *feel* bananas, but it was also just a major holiday travel weekend here. And my honest assumption when I see unattended cars/no driver in the front seat parked at pumps like that is that some member of the party is inside the gas station or attached store using the bathroom, getting food/lotto tickets/road supplies, prepaying for the gas, or stretching their back & legs. Even for 30min, sometimes there's lines inside or locked bathrooms. Not a normal wait time for normal gas on a normal day, but such is life!\n\nAlso, there was clearly another, equally occupied diesel pump that took at least 30min to fill up as well, or the spot would've opened before OP even \"had\" to fuss at that family, *and* I don't blame somebody with kids not wanting to further engage with a hostile stranger or feel safe leaving until they were gone (or inconveniencing someone who yelled at them out of spite!), so this entire scenario is still odd & very unnecessary from OP's end lol.", "I read the room, if it\u2019s busy the oh baby am I the most efficient gas filler.
