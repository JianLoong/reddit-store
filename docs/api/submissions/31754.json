So I waited behind them. \n\nAnd I waited. And waited. And waited. \n\nThe nozzle had been in their RV for 30 minutes and I saw no one come out of the vehicle or tend to the pump that whole time so I figured something must be up. I pulled around and was in a position I could see through their front windshield and it was an RV, it was a family just standing in there living their life.  \n\nFWIW, it was one of those \"Cruise America\" Rental RVs, so they were likely not experienced RV'ers. They were probably feeling like, \"Hey this is like our home now, everywhere is home. So let's just sit here.\"\n\nAnd here's where I might be the asshole, but Suddenly anger came over me and I beep beep beeped my horn and a lady came out and she said \n\n\"that was really rude! My whole family's in there!\"\n\n I said \n\n\"you can't just stay hooked up to a gas pump long after your tank is filled. this is not a rest stop.

She didn't remove the gas nozzle from her RV. She got back in her RV and continued on with her life with her family.\n\n Eventually another available pump opened up so I filled up and left, all while she was still there plugged into the pump before, during, and after I filled up and left. \n\nAs I pulled onto the highway she finally got out of her RV and unplugged the gas nozzle. \ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1700970044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1841o28/aita_for_confronting_someone_who_was_hogging_the/", "score": 205, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
