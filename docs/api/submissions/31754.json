Just clarifying that because some people in the comments have been assuming male pronouns for me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)\n\nMy fuel tank is on the driver side and I needed diesel so I had limited options as to which fuel pump I could pull up to.\n\n I saw someone with the gas nozzle in their RV and I figured it wouldn't be long because they were already there filling up and they would be gone soon. So I waited behind them. \n\nAnd I waited. And waited. And waited. \n\nThe nozzle had been in their RV for 30 minutes and I saw no one come out of the vehicle or tend to the pump that whole time so I figured something must be up. I pulled around and was in a position I could see through their front windshield and it was an RV, it was a family just standing in there living their life.  \n\nFWIW, it was one of those \"Cruise America\" Rental RVs, so they were likely not experienced RV'ers. They were probably feeling like, \"Hey this is like our home now, everywhere is home. So let's just sit here.\"\n\nAnd here's where I might be the asshole, but Suddenly anger came over me and I beep beep beeped my horn and a lady came out and she said \n\n\"that was really rude! My whole family's in there!\"\n\n I said \n\n\"you can't just stay hooked up to a gas pump long after your tank is filled. this is not a rest stop. You can't just hang out in your RV going about your life while other cars are waiting in line behind you, this is a busy gas station with the best prices, you can't just sit here and monopolize a pump while other cars are waiting behind you in line.\"\n\nEven after I said this, she stayed there.  She didn't remove the gas nozzle from her RV. She got back in her RV and continued on with her life with her family.\n\n Eventually another available pump opened up so I filled up and left, all while she was still there plugged into the pump before, during, and after I filled up and left. \n\nAs I pulled onto the highway she finally got out of her RV and unplugged the gas nozzle. \ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1700970044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1841o28/aita_for_confronting_someone_who_was_hogging_the/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
