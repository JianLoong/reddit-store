But op you have to start saying no. Practice it. Life sucks otherwise", "NTA\n\nNo, you are not a bad friend for being hesitant to lend your expensive Kindle to your friend. \n\nIt's reasonable to have reservations, especially if she has been irresponsible with her belongings in the past. \n\nSetting boundaries and expressing your concerns is important in maintaining a healthy friendship.", "No but you\u2019ve clearly identified your problem. People pleasing is just being toxic and harmful to yourself. She asked you a yes or no question to borrow an item. You can say no.", "NTA\n\nI have a Kindle, but I've never thought of it as being an expensive item (and no, I don't have a ton of expendable cash), in comparison to all my other tech.  I'd loan it out to a good friend BUT, that's me, not you.  YOU have the right to say no... To anything... and should exercise that right as you see fit.  As far as I'm concerned, I never see anyone as being an asshole for exercising their right to say no. \n\nNote:  As I don't see a Kindle as being an expensive tech item, my question would be why the friend doesn't just buy their own Kindle?  If they have enough for a vacation, then why not have enough for a $100 Kindle?", "Stop being a doormat. No is a full sentence, nta.", "~~I N F O:~~\n\n~~My first inclination was to say~~ **NTA**.\n\nThe questions we have to ask ourselves, or ask others, when they want to borrow something for their holiday is what are the chances of it being stolen, damaged or otherwise lost, would I mind if something happened to it, and would it be covered by covered by insurance or could they otherwise pay to replace my property if something happened.\n\nIt sounds like the answer to the first question is, there is a potentially higher than average chance of it being damaged or lost (and that is without considering the location of the holiday and safety of the property), and the answer to the second is yes I would mind.\n\n~~However, then it sunk in how you'd worded your post \"I asked her to take care of it, because she has been a bit irresponsible with some of her own things in the past.\"~~\n\n~~So my question to you: Did you ask her to take care of it, and nothing more, and you were simply explaining to Redditors that she's been irresponsible with her own things in the past? Or did you actually state in your response to your friend that she's been a bit irresponsible with her own things in the past?~~\n\nEdited for verdict following OP's reply, and to add: Friendship does not oblige us to lend anything requested to friends. Your friend was not TA to ask, as long as it is a request not a demand, and you aren't the AH to decline. If she'd not responded passive-aggressively, I'd be saying NAH.", "One reader to another\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut seriously, the inability to say no gets you and other people in worse situations than just saying no. Like in this instance, if you had just said, sorry but I just don't feel comfortable lending out my kindle, no harm no foul. But she could have easily read what you DID say as a dig at HER. I think that's still stupid but it happens.\n\nSeriously, people will more often than not want you to be honest about your actual intentions. Because if you aren't then they either have to guess yours or they will do things that hurt you. And they can kinda pick up on it. Seriously, people pleasures get in the way more than they help. They make conversing and getting things done truly and efficiently a lot harder and as friends become easily draining. This isn't me trying to blame you for this, I don't see it as a moral failing and you aren't bad for this quality, but it is a flaw.\n\nNo one is helped by you not being able to say no, everyone including yourself would benefit from you saying no. So get on that. \n\nNo is like \u2153 of the options to a lot of things and if you can't express a complete and true no, you are blocking off a massive amount of your options. \n\nStand up for yourself and have clearer and more honest communication.

It's completely normal to be hesitant when lending out expensive and valuable objects, esp to someone who doesn't have a good record of taking care of their own things. You agreed to give it to her anyway so there's nothing to feel bad about.", "NTA. She can get the app on her phone or tablet.", "NTA \n\nGet a good book on boundaries. The answer should have just been \u201cNo\u201d and you should have stuck with it.

That\u2019s enough of a reason to refuse to lend it.\n\nDo try to work on saying no to unreasonable requests. It will take some work, but in the long run it will make your life easier.\n\nKindle has free apps for most phones and laptops. You can read Kindle books on almost any device these days. No need for your friend to have your Kindle.", "NTA you didn\u2019t say anything bad about her or you just asked her to be careful with it.\n\nI don\u2019t like to lend things to my friends, because there\u2019s always issue if they lose it or a screw it up. Do I charge them full price to replace it with a brand new item even though it\u2019s not brand new, or do they just compensate me for whatever the used item would cost meaning I can\u2019t actually replace it?\n\nI just don\u2019t do it because I don\u2019t want to have issues, and if I do lend someone some thing it means I have accepted I might never see it again", "She can buy her own kindle they are cheap nta", "NTA- just don't let her borrow it. I wouldn't let anyone borrow my expensive electronics! She will be fine with a regular book", "NTA, but please learn how to say no. I'm sure you have reasons for it of course. Me... I was a people pleaser after having a abusive childhood. Took over 4 years to learn in therapy I could say no. \n\nAs for the Kindle their expensive depending on the model. Assuming you have a more expensive one since you brought that up. Unless you had it in writing she would pay for it if something happened..no way are you close to ah territory. I once loaned a friend a book and it was destroyed. Spent 25 on a hardcover the replaced it with a paperback. You would need in writing it would be bought new and the same model before I'd ever consider loaning mine out.", "NTA. I have 3 Kindles and would never loan any, not even to my husband.

A kindle is an odd thing to borrow, it's linked to your account. There are kindle apps for phones and tablets. She can easily get one herself.", "NTA - Just have a policy for yourself ahead of time about what you\u2019re willing to lend out and just stick with it. That way it\u2019s not personal to your friend and you don\u2019t have to think about it if it comes up. You can say, I\u2019m ok with sharing clothes once in a while, but other than that, I don\u2019t lend out my belongings. \nYou don\u2019t need to provide a reason. But I sympathize with you about feeling awkward saying no. I wouldn\u2019t ask a friend for this and my friends don\u2019t ask to borrow my stuff either. We all take care of our own needs. Sometimes someone may offer something if they think someone else could use something and they\u2019re ok parting with it, but we don\u2019t ask each other to take each other\u2019s stuff and put them in the awkward position of saying no. If someone were to ask me, I would assume they didn\u2019t think it a big deal and they might let me borrow it if the rolls were reversed and might think poorly of me if I say no, so it makes me feel bad, but I\u2019d rather awkwardly explain that I\u2019m not comfortable lending something out than just go along with it and feel awkward longer for not respecting my own boundaries.", "Does she not have a phone?
