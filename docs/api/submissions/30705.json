I\u2019d address this whole thing from this angle rather than she \u201cmakes bad choices\u201d.

If you gave every bit of that jewelry to your daughter today she'd likely be broke again in a year.\n\nThat brings me to my next point - your own estate planning.  Consider leaving your daughter's share of her inheritance to her as a trust where the income generated goes to her monthly or quarterly in a regular income stream, as opposed to her getting a lump sum.  She could request larger amounts from the principal at certain life events ($X is available for a wedding, $Y as a down payment on a house, unlimited if she, a spouse, or dependent has a major medical event, etc).
