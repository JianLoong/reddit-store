If you gave every bit of that jewelry to your daughter today she'd likely be broke again in a year.\n\nThat brings me to my next point - your own estate planning.  Consider leaving your daughter's share of her inheritance to her as a trust where the income generated goes to her monthly or quarterly in a regular income stream, as opposed to her getting a lump sum.  She could request larger amounts from the principal at certain life events ($X is available for a wedding, $Y as a down payment on a house, unlimited if she, a spouse, or dependent has a major medical event, etc).

She expected to inherit them which I would give them over if I didn\u2019t think she would sell them the first month", ">While yes, it\u2019s ~~safe~~ **natural** to assume you\u2019ll inherit your parents\u2019 belongings\n\nIt's never actually \"safe\" to assume you'll inherit anything. My dad passed in 2019 and everything went to mom. Their wills used to be \"everything to the kids equally\". Since dad passed, mom has changed her will at least half a dozen times as is her right. The \"safe\" approach is to assume you get nothing so that if you do get something, it's a bonus.", "Spending can be an additiction, and the boom/bust nature of her income can make such attitudes worse.", "I would say not even then. Will it to her children, or to a niece or nephew.", "Yes the \u201cyou\u2019re not using it\u201d comment stuck out to me. Looking at it fondly isn\u2019t \u201cusing\u201d it is it? As he\u2019s unlikely to want to wear it, the only other use he might be making of it would be to sell some of it, which is what she\u2019s implying she will do by using that word.", "I like the idea of her being dissapointed but then the Saga will never end for OP. Sounds like family would sue and shit and this would last for decades. But feels good just imagining her reaction lol", "No, everything went to me.", "That's actually a good idea I think", "she should be able to move back in with him or he should help pay her rent money if he\u2019s supposed to be protecting her", "Everything went to me", "It was written in the will that OP inherited it & once probate has been granted, it can't be changed as its a legal document. The only way a will can be changed is if it was contested.", "No, it went to him", "No - his wife delegated the jewelry to the father. Everything went to him (she knew how the daughter was)", "Or give her some costume stuff and see if she finds out its worthless at the same time she has no money.", "The wife left the jewellery to OP", "If you do this, there are ways to discretely track the piece. Might be worth looking into", "This was going to be my suggestion. She is definitely not to be trusted with the entire collection at once.", "Please put them in a bank box or something before your daughter or someone else decides to steal them from you when you're not home. NTA", "If they were willed to you, then they are yours, and she has no right to them during your life unless you *want* to give them away.\n\nShe sounds like she's in an MLM. Stash that stuff in Fort Knox, because she needs to sell it to buy more inventory.", "Keep it for your future grandchildren. Perhaps set up a trust or something to retain ownership if the pieces are that valuable and make it in the rules that the pieces can't be sold", "Safe deposit box.", "You already know that she cannot see past her nose.  What a shame.", "I thought that was customary, everyone I know has their will like that, if one parent dies all the estate goes to the living parent unless both die it is divided equally, and even then who knows it can even go to an organization.", "Depending on your country. In my home country in Eastern Europe, surviving family members (spouse and children) inherit the deceased, unless there is a will stating otherwise.", "I think lots of people would use the word solely to mean *wear* it, because that's the intended use. But I agree she sounds like she means to sell it, overall. Assuming OP is being straightforward.\n\nBut I also think keeping it to look at and recall memories, to experience the sentimental weight of them, is still a *use* in a very real and practical sense. Objects help connect us to memories and aid in recall. And so if he ever opens up the SAFE to look at them and reminisce, that's *a* use even if it's not their intended primary use.", "NTA then. Get buried in it as far as I'm concerned if she left it to you.", "What is he protecting her from? She's a 27-year-old adult. Keeping mom's jewels is protecting her from selling them for a quick buck.", "Why?\n\nBy that logic, he should still be enforcing a curfew for her too. Since it will protect her.\n\nMight as well prevent her from dating too. Since it will protect her.\n\nDo you know what protection means?", "Your joking, pay an 27 year old adults rent\u2026", "She's almost 30\n\nShe needs to grow the fuck up.", "It sounds as if your wife was aware of your daughters lack of financial nous. I don't blame you for the stance your taking.", "Especially if these are sentimental or heirloom pieces, make sure your will specifically gives them to someone else (or leave your daughter a few pieces and distribute the rest as you see fit).", "By discreetly tracking the piece he would be tracking his daughter by extension if she wears it, which is kind of weird and creepy.  I'm sure it's not too hard to figure out if she still has it in a year or not without involving trackers.", "Not only put in lock box but specifiy in his will what will be done with his estate.", "Yea, I would be afraid that she or even relatives thinking they are doing the right thing would steal them in the name of \"such and such would want them to have it\" not realizing that this is also about protecting these assets from being pawned off that have more value than just being instruments for cash.", "I was going to say the same thing. If your daughter sees them as hers, she probably will take them eventually.", "I think it\u2019s a bit harsh to suggest that his daughter might steal from him. He didn\u2019t suggest that in his question.  It\u2019s valid that a thief might though.", "To me, she sounds like a recruiter or some other commission only job.", "I'd believe that but OP says that some months she has plenty of money...so probably not an MLM.", "If she was in a MLM, she wouldn't have a bunch of months where she makes a lot of money in the first place.", "It's common and really easy since the law defaults that way too. Doesn't mean that the surviving spouse will carry out agreements made when both partners were still alive though.", "then don\u2019t say he\u2019s protecting her? sounds like he\u2019s protecting the jewelry", "If she doesn\u2019t change I will probably give them to my niece", "People do crazy shit when they\u2019re desperate and think they\u2019re bottled to something. She doesn\u2019t even have to know it\u2019s secured.", "My brother stole and sold most of my moms heirloom jewelry. Irreplaceable stuff that had been in the family for several generations and some big ticket things from my grandparents or dad from landmark events. Worst part was my brother didn\u2019t just pawn everything, he took the stuff to multiple cash-for-gold places around town where they basically treat everything as scrap metal and melt it down. My dad managed to track down a few pieces before they were destroyed, he had to go to the processing plant and they shut everything down to find what they could.  \n\nWhy don\u2019t you think his daughter would steal from him? Most crimes are not committed randomly by strangers.", "To me it sounds like she needs a new job with steady income.", "He's teaching a 27 year old a good life lesson here. She is immature and entitled he's doing a great job as a father.", "Might want to ask a lawyer about gifting them before your death.  Might make things easier on your neice later.", "Is your niece directly related to your late wife?", "Yep. My first husband stole and hocked most of the jewelry I inherited. Managed to get a few pieces back before I divorced his ass, but the rest, including the pocket watch my grandfather gave my father when he graduated from law school, is gone forever.", "Had the same thing with my brother. Lost a lot of family heirlooms, my parents only managed to recover about 5% of them. They noticed letters from the pawnshop, opened them to find out that it was a notification that the time to redeem the items was close to expiring.", "I\u2019m not saying she wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just saying that he knows his daughter and hasn\u2019t implied that she might. Being terrible with money and selfish doesn\u2019t necessarily also make her a thief. However, as he\u2019s told us he\u2019s got it all in the safe, he doesn\u2019t have a problem.", "lol who raised her to be immature and entitled??", "Yes, my wife was her aunt", "Was it you?"]}
