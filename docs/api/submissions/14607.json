I (22F) got out of a bad breakup 5 months ago and I\u2019ve been doing a lot of emotional eating to cope with it, we were dating for 3 years. It was a bad relationship because it was really toxic and unhealthy for me. But yeah I\u2019ve been eating a lot more food lately to try and cope. I know it isn\u2019t particularly healthy but it\u2019s a really hard habit to break.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m currently staying at my mom\u2019s house for a little while after Easter. Last night, I was really upset thinking about my relationship and I wanted to drive to McDonalds but I didn\u2019t have any money on me so I took some from my mom\u2019s money pot. The story behind the money pot is that it\u2019s money for anybody to use, when I lived here I was always allowed to use it for money for the bus, going out with friends etc. I looked at what I was going to buy on the website and I took 35 dollars to cover my meal. I ate there and then came home while everybody was asleep.\n\nMy mom woke up this morning and asked me where the money had gone. I told her that I thought everyone was allowed to use it and she told me I\u2019m an adult with an income now so I have just stolen from her. Apparently money is tighter than it used to be and she really needed that 35 dollars. I tried to explain my situation to her and the fact that I just really needed some food at that time and she said that it was a bullshit excuse and that I\u2019m just getting lazy and fat. She told me that I need to pay her back by Friday or she\u2019s not speaking to me anymore. Am I the asshole for \u201cstealing from her\u201d? The money pot used to be for everyone so I didn\u2019t mean to steal I feel really bad\n\nEdit: Yes I will be repaying her by Friday", "created_utc": 1681304831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jlpfl/aita_for_stealing_money_from_my_mom/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I visit my parents every 3-4 months, and even then I check if any rules have changed in that time. \n\nI totally understand the emotional eating, I do it myself sometimes. I've definitely easily eaten \u00a330 worth of mcdonalds in one sitting before. But, as you recognize yourself, that's not good for you. As others have recommended, maybe try talking to therapist, if you have the money for it. In the meantime, I would like to suggest getting cheap snacks that you can buy in bulk. That way, you won't be spending so much on emotional binges, and even though things like crisps/chips still aren't the best for you, it'll still be healthier than fast food. It's not the best solution, but since it can take a long time to overcome unhealthy relationships with food (believe me, as someone whose dealt with eating disorders since he was around 8 and is still dealing with them, I know), it's still a decent-ish solution in the meantime since it'll be better for both your health and your wallet. It also helps you to see how much you're eating, since you'll of course notice how quickly the snack horde (what I call it) depletes, which is a lot more \"tangible\" than food from a fast food place (which isn't there all the time and so it's harder to keep track of what/how much you're eating)\n\n*As a disclaimer: I am by no means an expert on eating disorders, this is just the sort of thing that I've found helpful for myself", "Info: how were you able to eat $35 of McDonald\u2019s?!?!

The fact is, you are recovering from a shitty relationship. I get it. However, you're displacing this difficult period by negatively impacting others around you. Fact of the matter is, you stole. Don't put fucking quotation marks around it. You 100% stole. Not only that, you don't seem to be doing well financially, and yet you YOLO'ed on McDonald's for $35. That's at least 5-6 sandwiches.

I still have those tendancies. And what you are doing is literally an eating disorder and an addiction.\n\nYou're being an asshole to yourself, first and foremost.\n\nBut let's move on to the real issue. You should have asked before taking money from a home you don't live in anymore. You shouldn't be spending that much at a fast food place, either.\n\nYou are an adult. And even if the relationship was toxic, that does not give you the excuse to be toxic to your family and your body, especially 5 months out.\n\nI'm in the camp of \"everyone should see a therapist every now and then,\" so please don't take that as an insult. But you need help. It's out of hand to where you're stealing money. You are a food addict.", "YTA.\n\nEveryone else is getting pissy about the amount spent at a goddam McD's, I'm just wondering exactly how you justified taking money from a household you don't belong to any longer?\n\nYou're an adult, you don't live there, your needs are not covered by your Mom's income.   \n\nYou literally stole from your mom. And you doubt that you're the asshole?", "This could have been NTA if it hadn't been for the gluttony of eating $35 worth of McDonald's food.

In the end YTA.", "YTA for taking that money, strictly speaking.\n\nLook, break-ups are hard, especially if they were abusive and the relationship was toxic. \n\nYou feel like such a chump, and you feel like you wasted a ton of time. Not to mention a bunch of scars, some physical and some mental.\n\nBut you need to pull yourself together and realize you're now spiraling into a horrible habit. Binge and emotional eating can damage you in the long run, especially if you're eating like you commented earlier. Luckily, you're still young, and you should be able to recover, but you have to put in the work. \n\nBuild back your self-confidence and health.  Use that sadness and anger and turn it towards bettering yourself.

It can be surprisingly easy to eat huge amounts in one sitting when you don't have a healthy relationship with food and often resort to it as a comfort. \n\nBut yeah, totally agree with your other two points.
