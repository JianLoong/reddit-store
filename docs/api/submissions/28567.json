My sister said to our aunt that since she\u2019s been around the family more now it\u2019s ridiculous she excluded over such a thing she had no control over. She told me that she doesn\u2019t appreciate them playing favorites and excluding her and making excuses for it. Also that she didn\u2019t care about not going to Hawaii, it\u2019s the point.  When they claim they wish they were closer to her. She said that they are potentially putting a wedge between us by doing things like this, and that as her sister, I should know how she feels. I told her this had nothing to do with me, and that our Aunt has a point with her childhood being the biggest reason things are the way they are. I also told her she was wrong for thinking our aunt was playing favoritism. \n\nShe told me it\u2019s a shame I don\u2019t see an issue with this. And that she looks at me different for siding with my aunt. Which I\u2019m not even doing. She said she clearly can\u2019t talk to me about how she feels and it\u2019s crazy how I\u2019m siding with someone that really hurt her. ugh just drama.

She doesn't say it. She says that instead. That reads to me like OP is trying to obscure the fact that her sister had no say in family dynamics; that whoever had custody of her kept her away. \"The past 9 years\" would have been since she was 17.\n\n**Well, which is it?** She chose to absent herself and thus was the cause of her exclusion? Or is it that a custodian wouldn't let her, in which case it's not remotely her fault? I have to guess it's the latter because she apparently tried to re-integrate when she turned 17 and probably wouldn't have been able to do that on her own accord beforehand.\n\nI think it would be *extreme* asshole behavior to blow off her upset as mere \"drama\" if it's the latter. She says the sister has been around / trying to rejoin the family; that the family *wants* to build build ties. If that's the case, excluding her sends an unnecessary fuck you. And since OP chose not to make this clear, I'm going to have to draw that inference barring new information. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't be surprised if she drops out of your life entirely. Then again, you sound like you wouldn't care.", "YTA. In fact, the only person who isn\u2019t an AH here is your sister. \n\nYour one for undermining her feelings. That\u2019s a shitty thing to do. \n\nYour aunt and uncle are one for holding her childhood against her. She had no control over where she spent her time, but she\u2019s the one getting blamed and being told she\u2019s an afterthought. What the actual fuck. \n\nYour dad is the biggest AH. He failed her. He failed to be a father to her. You can\u2019t be any sort of decent parent if you only see your kid 1% of the time.", "YTA: for brushing it off like it's nothing. Everyone in your family other than the sister are assholes, she's equally as much family as you are.", "YTA \n\nYour sister was telling you that she felt sidelined in the current situation. Which she was. She was telling you that as her sister she expected you to speak up for her when she was excluded from family things. Which you didn't.  You said that you didn't know initially that she wasn't invited on the trip, but when you found out rather than acting like an adult you tried to avoid the situation until it blew up in your faces. She's been around for a decade. Which is more than enough time to forge meaningful relationships if anyone but her was putting in the effort to do so. Your aunt and uncle were astoundingly shitty here. This was clearly favoritism, and you acting like it's not is just pathetic.", "YTA.  Part of calling her \u201csister\u201d is having her back and making sure she\u2019s included.  Aunt and Uncle are AH for living in the past.  Dad wins TA of the year award for letting this happen.", "YTA so your uncles FROM YOUR DADS SIDE WHO IS ALSO HER FUCKING DAD IS EXCLUDING HER??? And you can\u2019t see how fucking TERRIBLE THAT IS?? Horrible sister.\n\nYTA", "YTA - her childhood isn\u2019t her fault and it\u2019s cruel to blame her for her family favouring you and ignoring her. You are the golden child and you are getting things she never got, and that is objectively unfair. Why can\u2019t you at minimum acknowledge that?", "YTA. From what you've written, your sister advocated for herself in a very clear way to your aunt - impressive. Your sister then shared this with you...and you dismissed her. \n\n'I told her this had nothing to do with me, and that our Aunt has a point with her childhood being the biggest reason things are the way they are. I also told her she was wrong for thinking our aunt was playing favoritism.'\n\nThis is such AH behaviour. You ARE taking your aunt's side. Your sister is absolutely correct.", "INFO:\n\n>That's when we build our relationship\n\nWhat relationship? The kind where you exclude her? Where you excuse blatant favouritism under the garbage excuse of lost time? Where you excuse the people who hurt her and blame her \"childhood\" for it? Where you excuse her completely valid feelings as drama? Yeah, some relationship you have there.\n\n>our aunt told us that she's an afterthought because they didn't get to build a relationship with her when she was young\n\nIt has been *nine years*. Is that not enough? Are you even making an effort? \n\n>And because of \"lost time\" things are kinda the way they are\n\nAgain, nine years. Were you losing that time too? Or is that not enough to build a relationship? Can such a relationship only be built by knowing someone as a child? What were you guys doing for nine years?\n\n>When they claim they wish they were closer to her\n\nGee, I wonder if there's a solution to that. Like, I don't know, spending time with her *right now* instead of mourning the time they lost? Do any of you even care about her? Like, yeah, it's not about the trip, it's about your family clearing not making an effort to build a relationship with her and then lying and saying it's because of lost time. \n\n>ugh just drama\n\nWow. I wonder why she doesn't want to talk to you. \n\nOkay, so my last question is this: is it her fault she didn't get to spend her childhood with your dad's side of the family?", "Wow. Yeah, YTA. Everyone except your sister is an AH, actually. As soon as your sister was old enough, she made an effort to get to know your dad\u2019s side of the family. She\u2019s spent the last **9 years** doing that and not only is she still excluded, but you dismiss her feelings as \u201cdrama.\u201d \n\nAt this point, I genuinely hope she walks away from you and your dad\u2019s side of the family. You all sound like terrible people and she\u2019d be better off without you.", "Someone told your sister to her face she's nothing but an after thought for things that were outside her control when she was a CHILD and you said -- Yep, that's true. \n\nYTA.", "YTA - what an entitled, closed-minded brat. Enjoy losing your sister", "Your uncle and aunt are AH and you very inconsiderate of your sister\u2019s feelings.", "Info: have you imagined how you would feel if you were your sister? Does it differ from how she feels in reality?\n\nAs in, is your reaction to her because you genuinely think she is wrong about being upset she wasn't invited, and wrong by thinking by staying silent you are siding with your aunt and uncle? \n\nOr is it because deep down your desire to go on the trip is greater than your empathy for your sister, plus maybe you feel she is 26 and so old enough to control her emotions and be upset in secret rather than put you in this position?\n\nEither way is valid but if the second paragraph  is closer to the truth then I don't think it's fair to tell your sister there's no favouritism and that you aren't on your aunt and uncle's side. Thinking the favouritism is justified isn't the same as no favouritism and trying to convince your sister of something you don't even believe feels icky.", "YTA\n\nWhy are you even on here? You don't even sound like you want a relationship with your sister, so why don't you and your family tell her that, so she can get over yall and move on with her life?", "Sounds to me like they booked it for her graduation", "YTA. She had ZERO control over where she lived growing up. You said you lived 4 hours away from her and maybe saw her once a year because she lived with her mom which again was NOT her control. You and your dads family sound bitter for whatever reason toward your sister for reasons that she couldn\u2019t control or choose. Maybe when you\u2019re older you\u2019ll see where her point is because right now you aren\u2019t putting yourself in her shoes and just labeling her as \u201cdrama\u201d", "You're 18 years old, you know what you're doing. YTA", "YTA for dismissing her feelings. It's been 9 years since she was able to try and integrate into your lives. You're lying to yourself if you think your aunt and uncles don't play favourites by excluding her. This is just another instance of her being excluded by your extended family, but this time, it is a bigger thing she's being excluded from, and she couldn't hold it anymore. Think about it, 9 years since she was more involved in your lives, and she's still treated by them like more like an acquaintance, and not like your sister.", "She's right. She had no control over her childhood, and it\u2019s extremely unfair how she's being treated. Of course, you wouldn't see what's wrong with it because you're getting special treatment. YTA, and so is your aunt and uncle.\n\nEdit: Your father is also an AH for allowing this to happen.", "While I can't call you TA because you are in the middle of something that adults around you should be handling, your sister is right when she says, \"she\u2019s been around the family more now it\u2019s ridiculous she excluded over such a thing she had no control over.\" That's true. As to Hawaii, if your aunt and uncle are taking their kids and only you, that's fair for a graduation present. But otherwise, your sister is your father's daughter, as much as you are, and should be included in all of her father's family events as much as you are.", "NTA. What's been happening for the last nine years? Has sister been missing and resenting the missed time with her aunt and uncle all this time? You've been spending summers with them all that time and she never mentioned \"what about me?\" Or did she have other things to do rather than spend time with family? Why is it suddenly an issue now if it isn't about Hawaii? Maybe they didn't get to bond when your sister was a child,  but nine years is a generous period of time to build a relationship with family that lives close by. \n\nRegardless, your relationship with your aunt and uncle is independent of hers. You are close to them and she is not. This is not a matter of favoritism,  as it would be if you were both still children. Your aunt and uncle tried to treat her fairly as a child,  but we're blocked, which is a shame-- it cost her the relationship you enjoy,  but that is not the fault of you or your aunt and uncle. Now,  If your sister wants a closer relationship,  it's up to her to establish one.", "NTA! \n\nAunt and uncle and their son is going to Hawaii, and bring along op which they are close with, and who is close to their son.

She is 8 years older, and wouldn\u2019t have had the same relationship with cousin. She was 18 when op was 10.

As soon as she became an adult with the ability to enforce the bond, she did.  But because the adults didn't enforce it in youth, the past 9 years of effort she has put in doesn't count to y'all.

How would you feel if your aunt & uncle took her to Hawaii without you to celebrate all the graduations and birthdays they missed with her, to make up for all that \u201clost time\u201d? You were 9 when she came to live with you - how much more time do you all need to stop treating her like a stranger?", "YTA! She was a child, but is being effectively punished for the decisions and actions of the adults. Your aunt and uncle have no reason to exclude her other than bias and it makes me wonder if she is biracial. They are clearly showing favoritism, and simply claiming they didn't get to see her as much is a poor excuse. A trip would be a great time if they feel they haven't been getting enough these past few years. \n\nYou are seeing this through a child's eyes. You got the gift and you're happy to play with it. But it's not about the gift for your sister, it's the lack of love and affection she received from a whole side of her family that she may feel rejected her solely based on where she grew up and who raised her. That is unkind at best, downright evil at worst depending on why they feel they need to withhold that love.", "YTA 9 years is enough time to stop considering her an \"after though\". Looks like she's trying but your aunt and your uncle have no interest in trying too....oh but when they get called out.... \n\n\"I i wish that we were close but ...but you have to understand \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d we didn't see you in your childhood, the past 9 years doesn't matter \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\"", "I'm a stepmom, and I think NAH. Your aunt and uncle aren't required to include her, but it does really suck that they don't include her. It's not her fault at all that as a child, she was legally required to live with her mother. The reason you didn't see her a lot when you were younger is presumably because of the legal custody agreement that kept her with her mother. That's not her fault at all, and it's probably really devastating to her to be not included in the family because of something she had absolutely no control over whatsoever.", "YTA however I\u2019m going to chalk it up to the fact your 18 and don\u2019t know better.  As a child of divorce it sucks growing up with a part time parent who starts another family.  You always feel like you don\u2019t belong, that your an intruder on things.  Just frankly gets worse when your older because you start to understand everything more.  My dad tried but then when I became an adult he left it all to me.  He would never tell me any family news.  Would leave it to my stepmom who secretly wished I would just disappear from the family and sadly I gradually did.  My aunts were & still are my lifeline to family things.  If it wasn\u2019t for them I wouldn\u2019t even have an relationship with my paternal side.  So for that your Aunt is a Royal a*shole! \n\nPut yourself in her shoes.  How would you feel if a relative excluded you from a trip all because of who your parents are and how they raised you.  When I was 18 my late father won a trip for 4 to Disney.  My mom offered to spilt the difference (since I was an adult and the prize was 2 adults & 2 kids) with my dad so he could take me and my 1/2 brother with.  He said no that he didn\u2019t want to take me so instead they took my cousin and apparently she was a royal pain in the ass for the whole trip.  From what I understand she made them all miserable.  Karma..\n\nIf you want any relationship with your sister then you need to grow up and understand what your sister is going through.", "Okay, sorry kid but YTA. And maybe I\u2019m biased, because I was in a similar predicament, but I was in your sister position. It sucks as to not even have the opportunity to grow with your family and it sucks even more that when you finally get the chance to grow, everyone has already grown and it does put a wedge between people. By having just you on the trip and not her, it definitely shuts the door to her ever being connected to that side of the family again. Honestly, it probably would have been better for you to listen and not respond. You dug your own grave.", "YTA\n\nshe just wanted to talk to you about extremely valid feelings and your response is \u201cugh drama\u201c?  That\u2019s so dismissive.

You don\u2019t see the problem because you\u2019re not the one being excluded. \n\nShe\u2019s your sister, and it seems like she\u2019s trying.

Which is fair. \n\nYour sister was not in control of custody. The fact that your father didn't apply for, fight for, or attempt to spend more than a week a year with his child is HIS FAULT. Literally. \n\nThe fact that he sends all of his kids to be cared for by other adults every summer... so his other child stayed with their mom... is HIS FAULT. \n\nThe fact that he didn't keep your aunt and uncle involved or up to date on her life, which he obviously did not do... is HIS FAULT. \n\nThe fact that nine years ago (she would be 15 if she's 26 now)... your dad put zero effort into bridging those gaps and making sure she spent time with his family (I'm guessing because he just prefers not to have time with his kids whenever possible based on the fact that it's a 50/50 with you and 1 week a year with her but every summer you're being cared for by entirely different adults). ... is HIS FAULT. \n\nYour aunt and uncle pretending 3-4 years growing up wasn't enough time to bond with your sister is their fault. They didn't put in the effort either, and she was a literal child... whom they supposedly also didn't go out their way to get to know or include... \n\nAnd now for 5-6 years as an adult she does spend as much time as she can with you all .. only to be pulled aside and told that she isn't included because of the choices her dad made.... \n\nIf this trip is solely a graduation present it makes sense that the only kid who isn't theirs your uncle and aunt are bringing along is you.... but that's about it being a present... the fact that the explanation is \" we haven't bonded with you\" is kind of how you know it's an excuse. Cause \"it's a graduation present for a graduating teenager\" isn't hard to say. \n\nSo you call that drama... mostly because it doesn't impact you and you just want whatever it is you want.

I saw my aunt take her in a room and talk to her, I didn\u2019t know what they talked about nor did I ask- until my sister reached out to me yesterday. \n\nBasically she said she\u2019s had time to think about that day and said our aunt told her that she\u2019s an afterthought because they didn\u2019t get to build a relationship with her when she was young. And because of \u201clost time\u201d things are kinda the way they are. My sister said to our aunt that since she\u2019s been around the family more now it\u2019s ridiculous she excluded over such a thing she had no control over. She told me that she doesn\u2019t appreciate them playing favorites and excluding her and making excuses for it. When they claim they wish they were closer to her. She said that they are potentially putting a wedge between us by doing things like this, and that as her sister, I should know how she feels. I told her this had nothing to do with me, and that our Aunt has a point with her childhood being the biggest reason things are the way they are. I also told her she was wrong for thinking our aunt was playing favoritism. \n\nShe told me it\u2019s a shame I don\u2019t see an issue with this. And that she looks at me different for siding with my aunt. Which I\u2019m not even doing. She said she clearly can\u2019t talk to me about how she feels and it\u2019s crazy how I\u2019m siding with someone that really hurt her. ugh just drama.

Get real. She's been around the last 9 years and if you, your aunt and uncle wanted to build the relationship more you could have.  To say her childhood is the factor is complete trash.  For you to side with your aunt and uncle over the slight is either naive or self-centered because you are getting the perks.  You all knew you were being dodgy because you made the plans in secret to her.  If you all point blank said in the beginning that there was a trip planned and openly said she wasn't invited, there may have been hurt feelings, but it would have been an open and honest conversation vs whatever convoluted reason you all came up with to exclude her.", "YTA\n\nSo your sister was excluded from half of her family for her entire childhood due to events out of her control.

Her aunt cruelly describes her as an 'afterthought' *to her face* as she learns she is being excluded from something yet again. Not only excluded, but people are lying by omission to her about the trip.\n\nShe hasn't complained or demanded an invitation. She simply communicated to you that your aunt was behaving badly, hoping for some comfort and understanding. Instead, you blame her, even though everything that has happened has been done *to* her, NOT *by* her.\n\nYour aunt is absolutely playing favourites. She pulled your sister aside to twist the knife about things your sister had no say in, obviously disagreed with, and was deeply hurt by. Why? What did your aunt gain from that exactly, except causing her niece a great deal of pain? Her handling of this was utterly despicable.\n\nAnd you? If you can't see how heinous this situation is, then you should be ashamed. It's very easy to say someone isn't playing favourites when *you are the favourite.* You are gaining all of the benefit. She wasn't even asking for you to change the situation, just for compassion. You couldn't even give her that.\n\nBut here's the thing. Just remember that it easily could have been you. You could have been the daughter living further away who would now be considered an intruder into the family you hold dear. Your aunt chooses you now simply because you lived closer as a child.

Also because of the age gap between OP and sister it makes sense auntie and uncle only planned to pay for OP and their own kids, but they still should have let the sister know. At 26 years old I\u2019m sure she would have understood she would have to pay for herself and she could have maybe done so, if she were told about this trip when it was being planned.
