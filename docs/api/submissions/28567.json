My sister said to our aunt that since she\u2019s been around the family more now it\u2019s ridiculous she excluded over such a thing she had no control over. She told me that she doesn\u2019t appreciate them playing favorites and excluding her and making excuses for it. Also that she didn\u2019t care about not going to Hawaii, it\u2019s the point.  When they claim they wish they were closer to her. She said that they are potentially putting a wedge between us by doing things like this, and that as her sister, I should know how she feels. I told her this had nothing to do with me, and that our Aunt has a point with her childhood being the biggest reason things are the way they are. I also told her she was wrong for thinking our aunt was playing favoritism. \n\nShe told me it\u2019s a shame I don\u2019t see an issue with this. And that she looks at me different for siding with my aunt. Which I\u2019m not even doing. She said she clearly can\u2019t talk to me about how she feels and it\u2019s crazy how I\u2019m siding with someone that really hurt her. ugh just drama.

She doesn't say it. She says that instead. That reads to me like OP is trying to obscure the fact that her sister had no say in family dynamics; that whoever had custody of her kept her away. \"The past 9 years\" would have been since she was 17.\n\n**Well, which is it?** She chose to absent herself and thus was the cause of her exclusion? Or is it that a custodian wouldn't let her, in which case it's not remotely her fault? I have to guess it's the latter because she apparently tried to re-integrate when she turned 17 and probably wouldn't have been able to do that on her own accord beforehand.\n\nI think it would be *extreme* asshole behavior to blow off her upset as mere \"drama\" if it's the latter. She says the sister has been around / trying to rejoin the family; that the family *wants* to build build ties. If that's the case, excluding her sends an unnecessary fuck you. And since OP chose not to make this clear, I'm going to have to draw that inference barring new information. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't be surprised if she drops out of your life entirely. Then again, you sound like you wouldn't care.", "YTA. In fact, the only person who isn\u2019t an AH here is your sister. \n\nYour one for undermining her feelings. That\u2019s a shitty thing to do. \n\nYour aunt and uncle are one for holding her childhood against her. She had no control over where she spent her time, but she\u2019s the one getting blamed and being told she\u2019s an afterthought. What the actual fuck. \n\nYour dad is the biggest AH. He failed her. He failed to be a father to her. You can\u2019t be any sort of decent parent if you only see your kid 1% of the time.", "YTA: for brushing it off like it's nothing. Everyone in your family other than the sister are assholes, she's equally as much family as you are.", "YTA \n\nYour sister was telling you that she felt sidelined in the current situation. Which she was. She was telling you that as her sister she expected you to speak up for her when she was excluded from family things. Which you didn't.  You said that you didn't know initially that she wasn't invited on the trip, but when you found out rather than acting like an adult you tried to avoid the situation until it blew up in your faces. She's been around for a decade. Which is more than enough time to forge meaningful relationships if anyone but her was putting in the effort to do so. Your aunt and uncle were astoundingly shitty here. This was clearly favoritism, and you acting like it's not is just pathetic.", "YTA.  Part of calling her \u201csister\u201d is having her back and making sure she\u2019s included.  Aunt and Uncle are AH for living in the past.  Dad wins TA of the year award for letting this happen.", "YTA so your uncles FROM YOUR DADS SIDE WHO IS ALSO HER FUCKING DAD IS EXCLUDING HER??? And you can\u2019t see how fucking TERRIBLE THAT IS?? Horrible sister.\n\nYTA", "YTA - her childhood isn\u2019t her fault and it\u2019s cruel to blame her for her family favouring you and ignoring her. You are the golden child and you are getting things she never got, and that is objectively unfair. Why can\u2019t you at minimum acknowledge that?", "YTA. From what you've written, your sister advocated for herself in a very clear way to your aunt - impressive. Your sister then shared this with you...and you dismissed her. \n\n'I told her this had nothing to do with me, and that our Aunt has a point with her childhood being the biggest reason things are the way they are. I also told her she was wrong for thinking our aunt was playing favoritism.'\n\nThis is such AH behaviour. You ARE taking your aunt's side. Your sister is absolutely correct.", "INFO:\n\n>That's when we build our relationship\n\nWhat relationship? The kind where you exclude her? Where you excuse blatant favouritism under the garbage excuse of lost time? Where you excuse the people who hurt her and blame her \"childhood\" for it? Where you excuse her completely valid feelings as drama? Yeah, some relationship you have there.\n\n>our aunt told us that she's an afterthought because they didn't get to build a relationship with her when she was young\n\nIt has been *nine years*. Is that not enough? Are you even making an effort? \n\n>And because of \"lost time\" things are kinda the way they are\n\nAgain, nine years. Were you losing that time too? Or is that not enough to build a relationship? Can such a relationship only be built by knowing someone as a child? What were you guys doing for nine years?\n\n>When they claim they wish they were closer to her\n\nGee, I wonder if there's a solution to that. Like, I don't know, spending time with her *right now* instead of mourning the time they lost? Do any of you even care about her? Like, yeah, it's not about the trip, it's about your family clearing not making an effort to build a relationship with her and then lying and saying it's because of lost time. \n\n>ugh just drama\n\nWow. I wonder why she doesn't want to talk to you. \n\nOkay, so my last question is this: is it her fault she didn't get to spend her childhood with your dad's side of the family?", "Wow. Yeah, YTA. Everyone except your sister is an AH, actually. As soon as your sister was old enough, she made an effort to get to know your dad\u2019s side of the family. She\u2019s spent the last **9 years** doing that and not only is she still excluded, but you dismiss her feelings as \u201cdrama.\u201d \n\nAt this point, I genuinely hope she walks away from you and your dad\u2019s side of the family. You all sound like terrible people and she\u2019d be better off without you.", "Someone told your sister to her face she's nothing but an after thought for things that were outside her control when she was a CHILD and you said -- Yep, that's true. \n\nYTA.", "YTA - what an entitled, closed-minded brat. Enjoy losing your sister", "Your uncle and aunt are AH and you very inconsiderate of your sister\u2019s feelings.", "Info: have you imagined how you would feel if you were your sister? Does it differ from how she feels in reality?\n\nAs in, is your reaction to her because you genuinely think she is wrong to be upset she wasn't invited, and wrong to think by staying silent you are siding with your aunt and uncle? \n\nOr is it because deep down your desire to go on the trip is greater than your empathy for your sister, plus maybe you feel she is 26 and so old enough to control her emotions and be upset in secret rather than put you in this position?\n\nEither way is valid but if the second paragraph  is closer to the truth then I don't think it's fair to tell your sister there's no favouritism and that you aren't on your aunt and uncle's side. Thinking the favouritism is justified isn't the same as no favouritism and trying to convince your sister of something you don't believe feels icky.", "YTA\n\nWhy are you even on here? You don't even sound like you want a relationship with your sister, so why don't you and your family tell her that, so she can get over yall and move on with her life?", "Sounds to me like they booked it for her graduation", "YTA. She had ZERO control over where she lived growing up. You said you lived 4 hours away from her and maybe saw her once a year because she lived with her mom which again was NOT her control. You and your dads family sound bitter for whatever reason toward your sister for reasons that she couldn\u2019t control or choose. Maybe when you\u2019re older you\u2019ll see where her point is because right now you aren\u2019t putting yourself in her shoes and just labeling her as \u201cdrama\u201d", "You're 18 years old, you know what you're doing. YTA", "YTA for dismissing her feelings. It's been 9 years since she was able to try and integrate into your lives. You're lying to yourself if you think your aunt and uncles don't play favourites by excluding her. This is just another instance of her being excluded by your extended family, but this time, it is a bigger thing she's being excluded from, and she couldn't hold it anymore. Think about it, 9 years since she was more involved in your lives, and she's still treated by them like more like an acquaintance, and not like your sister.", "She's right. She had no control over her childhood, and it\u2019s extremely unfair how she's being treated. Of course, you wouldn't see what's wrong with it because you're getting special treatment. YTA, and so is your aunt and uncle.\n\nEdit: Your father is also an AH for allowing this to happen.", "While I can't call you TA because you are in the middle of something that adults around you should be handling, your sister is right when she says, \"she\u2019s been around the family more now it\u2019s ridiculous she excluded over such a thing she had no control over.\" That's true. As to Hawaii, if your aunt and uncle are taking their kids and only you, that's fair for a graduation present. But otherwise, your sister is your father's daughter, as much as you are, and should be included in all of her father's family events as much as you are.", "NTA. What's been happening for the last nine years? Has sister been missing and resenting the missed time with her aunt and uncle all this time? You've been spending summers with them all that time and she never mentioned \"what about me?\" Or did she have other things to do rather than spend time with family? Why is it suddenly an issue now if it isn't about Hawaii? Maybe they didn't get to bond when your sister was a child,  but nine years is a generous period of time to build a relationship with family that lives close by. \n\nRegardless, your relationship with your aunt and uncle is independent of hers. You are close to them and she is not. This is not a matter of favoritism,  as it would be if you were both still children. Your aunt and uncle tried to treat her fairly as a child,  but we're blocked, which is a shame-- it cost her the relationship you enjoy,  but that is not the fault of you or your aunt and uncle. Now,  If your sister wants a closer relationship,  it's up to her to establish one.", "NTA! \n\nAunt and uncle and their son is going to Hawaii, and bring along op which they are close with, and who is close to their son.

She is 8 years older, and wouldn\u2019t have had the same relationship with cousin. She was 18 when op was 10.

As soon as she became an adult with the ability to enforce the bond, she did.  But because the adults didn't enforce it in youth, the past 9 years of effort she has put in doesn't count to y'all.

How would you feel if your aunt & uncle took her to Hawaii without you to celebrate all the graduations and birthdays they missed with her, to make up for all that \u201clost time\u201d? You were 9 when she came to live with you - how much more time do you all need to stop treating her like a stranger?", "YTA! She was a child, but is being effectively punished for the decisions and actions of the adults. Your aunt and uncle have no reason to exclude her other than bias and it makes me wonder if she is biracial. They are clearly showing favoritism, and simply claiming they didn't get to see her as much is a poor excuse. A trip would be a great time if they feel they haven't been getting enough these past few years. \n\nYou are seeing this through a child's eyes. You got the gift and you're happy to play with it. But it's not about the gift for your sister, it's the lack of love and affection she received from a whole side of her family that she may feel rejected her solely based on where she grew up and who raised her. That is unkind at best, downright evil at worst depending on why they feel they need to withhold that love.", "YTA 9 years is enough time to stop considering her an \"after though\". Looks like she's trying but your aunt and your uncle have no interest in trying too....oh but when they get called out.... \n\n\"I i wish that we were close but ...but you have to understand \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d we didn't see you in your childhood, the past 9 years doesn't matter \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\ud83d\ude1e\"", "I'm a stepmom, and I think NAH. Your aunt and uncle aren't required to include her, but it does really suck that they don't include her. It's not her fault at all that as a child, she was legally required to live with her mother. The reason you didn't see her a lot when you were younger is presumably because of the legal custody agreement that kept her with her mother. That's not her fault at all, and it's probably really devastating to her to be not included in the family because of something she had absolutely no control over whatsoever.", "YTA however I\u2019m going to chalk it up to the fact your 18 and don\u2019t know better.  As a child of divorce it sucks growing up with a part time parent who starts another family.  You always feel like you don\u2019t belong, that your an intruder on things.  Just frankly gets worse when your older because you start to understand everything more.  My dad tried but then when I became an adult he left it all to me.  He would never tell me any family news.  Would leave it to my stepmom who secretly wished I would just disappear from the family and sadly I gradually did.  My aunts were & still are my lifeline to family things.  If it wasn\u2019t for them I wouldn\u2019t even have an relationship with my paternal side.  So for that your Aunt is a Royal a*shole! \n\nPut yourself in her shoes.  How would you feel if a relative excluded you from a trip all because of who your parents are and how they raised you.  When I was 18 my late father won a trip for 4 to Disney.  My mom offered to spilt the difference (since I was an adult and the prize was 2 adults & 2 kids) with my dad so he could take me and my 1/2 brother with.  He said no that he didn\u2019t want to take me so instead they took my cousin and apparently she was a royal pain in the ass for the whole trip.  From what I understand she made them all miserable.  Karma..\n\nIf you want any relationship with your sister then you need to grow up and understand what your sister is going through.", "Okay, sorry kid but YTA. And maybe I\u2019m biased, because I was in a similar predicament, but I was in your sister position. It sucks as to not even have the opportunity to grow with your family and it sucks even more that when you finally get the chance to grow, everyone has already grown and it does put a wedge between people. By having just you on the trip and not her, it definitely shuts the door to her ever being connected to that side of the family again. Honestly, it probably would have been better for you to listen and not respond. You dug your own grave.", "YTA\n\nshe just wanted to talk to you about extremely valid feelings and your response is \u201cugh drama\u201c?  That\u2019s so dismissive.

You don\u2019t see the problem because you\u2019re not the one being excluded. \n\nShe\u2019s your sister, and it seems like she\u2019s trying.

Which is fair. \n\nYour sister was not in control of custody. The fact that your father didn't apply for, fight for, or attempt to spend more than a week a year with his child is HIS FAULT. Literally. \n\nThe fact that he sends all of his kids to be cared for by other adults every summer... so his other child stayed with their mom... is HIS FAULT. \n\nThe fact that he didn't keep your aunt and uncle involved or up to date on her life, which he obviously did not do... is HIS FAULT. \n\nThe fact that nine years ago (she would be 15 if she's 26 now)... your dad put zero effort into bridging those gaps and making sure she spent time with his family (I'm guessing because he just prefers not to have time with his kids whenever possible based on the fact that it's a 50/50 with you and 1 week a year with her but every summer you're being cared for by entirely different adults). ... is HIS FAULT. \n\nYour aunt and uncle pretending 3-4 years growing up wasn't enough time to bond with your sister is their fault. They didn't put in the effort either, and she was a literal child... whom they supposedly also didn't go out their way to get to know or include... \n\nAnd now for 5-6 years as an adult she does spend as much time as she can with you all .. only to be pulled aside and told that she isn't included because of the choices her dad made.... \n\nIf this trip is solely a graduation present it makes sense that the only kid who isn't theirs your uncle and aunt are bringing along is you.... but that's about it being a present... the fact that the explanation is \" we haven't bonded with you\" is kind of how you know it's an excuse. Cause \"it's a graduation present for a graduating teenager\" isn't hard to say. \n\nSo you call that drama... mostly because it doesn't impact you and you just want whatever it is you want.

I saw my aunt take her in a room and talk to her, I didn\u2019t know what they talked about nor did I ask- until my sister reached out to me yesterday. \n\nBasically she said she\u2019s had time to think about that day and said our aunt told her that she\u2019s an afterthought because they didn\u2019t get to build a relationship with her when she was young. And because of \u201clost time\u201d things are kinda the way they are. My sister said to our aunt that since she\u2019s been around the family more now it\u2019s ridiculous she excluded over such a thing she had no control over. She told me that she doesn\u2019t appreciate them playing favorites and excluding her and making excuses for it. When they claim they wish they were closer to her. She said that they are potentially putting a wedge between us by doing things like this, and that as her sister, I should know how she feels. I told her this had nothing to do with me, and that our Aunt has a point with her childhood being the biggest reason things are the way they are. I also told her she was wrong for thinking our aunt was playing favoritism. \n\nShe told me it\u2019s a shame I don\u2019t see an issue with this. And that she looks at me different for siding with my aunt. Which I\u2019m not even doing. She said she clearly can\u2019t talk to me about how she feels and it\u2019s crazy how I\u2019m siding with someone that really hurt her. ugh just drama.

Get real. She's been around the last 9 years and if you, your aunt and uncle wanted to build the relationship more you could have.  To say her childhood is the factor is complete trash.  For you to side with your aunt and uncle over the slight is either naive or self-centered because you are getting the perks.  You all knew you were being dodgy because you made the plans in secret to her.  If you all point blank said in the beginning that there was a trip planned and openly said she wasn't invited, there may have been hurt feelings, but it would have been an open and honest conversation vs whatever convoluted reason you all came up with to exclude her.", "YTA\n\nSo your sister was excluded from half of her family for her entire childhood due to events out of her control.

Her aunt cruelly describes her as an 'afterthought' *to her face* as she learns she is being excluded from something yet again. Not only excluded, but people are lying by omission to her about the trip.\n\nShe hasn't complained or demanded an invitation. She simply communicated to you that your aunt was behaving badly, hoping for some comfort and understanding. Instead, you blame her, even though everything that has happened has been done *to* her, NOT *by* her.\n\nYour aunt is absolutely playing favourites. She pulled your sister aside to twist the knife about things your sister had no say in, obviously disagreed with, and was deeply hurt by. Why? What did your aunt gain from that exactly, except causing her niece a great deal of pain? Her handling of this was utterly despicable.\n\nAnd you? If you can't see how heinous this situation is, then you should be ashamed. It's very easy to say someone isn't playing favourites when *you are the favourite.* You are gaining all of the benefit. She wasn't even asking for you to change the situation, just for compassion. You couldn't even give her that.\n\nBut here's the thing. Just remember that it easily could have been you. You could have been the daughter living further away who would now be considered an intruder into the family you hold dear. Your aunt chooses you now simply because you lived closer as a child.

Also because of the age gap between OP and sister it makes sense auntie and uncle only planned to pay for OP and their own kids, but they still should have let the sister know. At 26 years old I\u2019m sure she would have understood she would have to pay for herself and she could have maybe done so, if she were told about this trip when it was being planned.

She fit like a glove and was the missing puzzle piece we never knew we needed. She has struggled with feeling left out because of the years she wasn\u2019t there making the memories we talk about.

Your sister had no control of her relationships when she was a kid, and it's amazing that she has tried to build them now. I'm guessing she's going to reevaluate that now.

She was able to grow closer and develop more meaningful connections with your dad, you, and the extended family.\n\nOr so she thought.\n\nYour aunt and uncle seem to have a very special relationship with you, and there is nothing wrong with that.  It's very generous of them to gift you a trip to Hawaii for your graduation.  But them excluding your sister from this trip is a real jerk move, especially for the reason (excuse) they gave her.  They basically blamed the fact that she wasn't around much when she was a child so they weren't able to get to know her then, and now they don't care to.  They blame \"lost time\" - what utter nonsense.  They could make up for that time, if they cared enough.  No matter what your sister does now to try and get closer to your aunt and uncle doesn't make any difference.  She's never going to be as important to them as you are - hello, favoritism!\n\nYour reaction to your sister expressing how your aunt and uncle made her feel about this was to dismiss her feelings, tell her she was wrong while at the same time agreeing with their BS reason for not inviting her.

Tell her you are sorry she is hurt but there is nothing you can do to change the situation. \n\nIt is like my sister says, (... but you have so many friends.). I spent years developing relationships, while she put herself into a cocoon with her inconsiderate ways, selfishness and jealousy.  I love her but I do not feel guilty.", "Everyone but your sister is the assholw", "NTA.  She's 26, she can join the trip if she pays her way.  Did she make that offer or assume someone else would pay for her to join?", "Unpopular opinion, but NTA. The sister is feeling excluded and like they are playing favourites because she wasn\u2019t invited to go on a trip that the aunt and uncle booked for their family unit. They invited OP because OP *lived with these people for a few months every year for the past decade*, so she has built a very close relationship with them that sounds like it is closer than a regular aunt/uncle and niece relationship. The sister doesn\u2019t have as good a relationship with the aunt and uncle as OP does. In fact, even though the sister has been around the family for the past nine years, OP says the sister didn\u2019t spend the summers there like she did. Regardless of the reason the sister didn\u2019t get to spend every summer there since she was a kid, and I can think of plenty (controlling mother, apathetic father or sister not seeing the appeal in spending her summers out of state instead of chilling with her friends when she went to live with their dad), the fact remains that she didn\u2019t and they didn\u2019t get to build the same bond with her that OP did. So while I have sympathy for the sister feeling excluded because OP was invited to do something fun, she is misunderstanding the difference between her relationship to her uncle/aunt and OP\u2019s relationship to the uncle/aunt as favouritism while I don\u2019t think it is.\n\nIn fact, I wonder if the aunt actually told the sister she is an afterthought or if the sister is just taking it that way. I can definitely imagine the aunt trying to explain to the sister that they didn\u2019t think to include her because it is a vacation for their family and OP is invited along because they have such a good bond with her. The aunt may have worded things awkwardly or badly, the sister may have taken things differently than they were intended.\n\nBut at the end of the day, these are two adults taking an 18 year old (still a child in a lot of ways) that has lived with them for a few months every year in the past decade on a vacation, while not inviting the 26 year old sister (by this point, you\u2019re an adult) that they don\u2019t have as strong a relationship with. The situation sucks, but trying to make anyone in this situation appear to be the bad guy is a bunch of unnecessary drama", "Honestly NTA. Relationships don\u2019t spring into existence because it\u2019s not fair that they didn\u2019t form earlier. You spent every summer with your aunt and uncle, you\u2019re practically part of their nuclear family while your sister is extended family at best. I have nieces and nephews, I\u2019ve known since they were born, I have a close relationship with them that I would never have with, say, a 17-year-old they decide to adopt. In nine years, that would never change. And this is your graduation trip. Why would your sister be invited anyways?\n\nI have cousins that I\u2019ve spent time with since I was a kid and I know quite well. I also have cousins that I\u2019ve met only a couple times and barely know them. One cousin I barely know because his dad kept him away from the family always joins the family call at Christmas. He seems like a nice guy and I can tell he really wants to form connections with his aunts, uncles, and cousins, but I just don\u2019t feel it. To me, it would just be getting to know an adult that\u2019s like seven years older than me, which is a bit odd. I don\u2019t think they should have said it the way they did, but it\u2019s completely reasonable for your aunt and uncle to be closer to the niece they actually saw growing up", "NTA.

OP had the privilege of growing up in a town with close proximity to not only their dad but also their dad's side of the family. There's nothing wrong with that, it's a blessing. \n\nOP's sister didn't have that. Not with their dad nor with his side of the family. Once the sister had the ability to choose, she came around and built a relationship. \n\nThe same way it isn't OP's fault that she had access & proximity, it's not the sister's fault she didn't. But OP needs to do some introspection bc this won't be the only situation where the privilege of access & proximity to family will impact the ability to understand where her sister is coming from.\n\n2. Being told you're an afterthought is... hurtful, isolating, and just... why would u say that to someone you care about?\n\nBut also, why do they want to be \"close\" to someone they care so little about that they forget she exists?\nBecause it comes across like an excuse to exclude her without any accountability for excluding her.\n\nAnd if they forget she exists, why would she believe that they want to be close to her? People usually don't forget people they care about.", "NTA\u2026very confused on how others think that you are.

You told her the truth, and you weren't rubbing her nose in it, just explaining. Your sister seems very immature for a 26-year-old. No one has the right to dictate how someone else spends their money and who they chose to vacation with. In my own family, my younger son was invited to Disneyland by his uncle (my brother) while my older children were not. He was 16 at the time, and the two older kids were in their twenties. He had spent one summer living with and working for this uncle, whereas the two older kids had not. No one raised a fuss since it made sense for my brother to only invite the younger kid who had lived intimately with them and their kids.

Ages are truly important.", "NTA, unpopular I suppose. I think people forget you're only 18 and also that she is 26. It sucks, I'm assuming her mother did this to her, so it's also not her fault. You're correct saying you are not involved. I was the 26 year old in this situation. As tough as it is, sometimes you have to realize you had different childhoods and the people you're close with may not be the same. It took me a long time to figure this out.  Also, though, this was a graduation gift, not some random family vacation and not EVERYONE but her is going. Only you are. You are 18. She is 26. It's more reasonable to expect they would offer something similar if, say, she graduated from college or another accomplishment. Then she can be mad. I don't have the same relationships with people that my half sisters do and vice versa and it's the same people we interact with. It is lost time, after I lost time with my other parent and family because my mother is awful, I could never get it back. We both tried but the connection just wasn't there and idt it ever would've been yanno, but for my sister she has a better relationship and I'm glad for her for that. I never held it against her bc I want good things for her, maybe your sister doesn't have that connection with you. But from your pt of view if you want to try to maintain this relationship I definitely would not talk about these things, rub them in her face, or use them against her or to gloat in any way bc then of course your the A.

Bc she's related? What if there's little to no connection between their (uncles) family and her? It's just the way it is. Life is not fair and it's scary how many people think it is.", "Doesn\u2019t make it right", "The problem isn't the trip, it's the why the aunt provided. She told the young woman who's been trying to make up for lost time and building a relationship that she's \"ant afterthought\". They tried to hide the trip instead of talking it through with sister. The aunt was needlessly hurtful and blamed the lack of a relationship on the sister when the problem was with her parents.", "Sister has been in OPs life longer than not Part of it.", "This. If the story was from Uncle/Aunt nobody would be calling them an AH because the sister is not entitled to it. If It was a family vacation it would be different, but not even their father is going.", "Ok, thanks. \"Aunt-in-law\" threw me, because that's not what she is.", "So does that mean she is not allowed to tell her sister how she feels????", "18 year olds can vote in elections, serve in the military, and be tried as adults in criminal cases in a lot of countries. So being a kind person who has normal emotional interactions with their siblings is fair game for an 18 year old.\n\nJust a thought for your dumb ass, not-at-all adult response.", "I mean it could also be your point. It's entirely possible that the sister wasn't called an afterthought at all.", "Feels like it, doesn't it? But still, she's been making an effort to get to know them for 9 years. How dad can sit by and watch this happen beggars belief.", "That was my thought too. The aunt and uncle seem to be taking their own family plus a niece that recently reached the age of majority, who also happens to be close to their kid and a similar age. \n\nTheir other niece is 26. If all their kids are younger, it would change the dynamic of the trip. Instead of the teenagers hanging out while the adults steal some couple time, unless their older niece would want to hang with teenagers, they\u2019d feel obligated to entertain her. \n\nThis woman isn\u2019t their teenager, and cousins aren\u2019t obligated to hang out with absolutely every one of their cousins. That\u2019s just normal family dynamics. Dragging OP into her disappointment is childish. \n\nMy youngest sibling went on trips with my parents alone after he older ones left home. By 20/21, I was saving for my own international trips, and choosing my own destinations. This is no different.", "A good parent would refuse to go on the trip if his brother wouldn't invite both of them.", "I don't think the sister is mad about not being invited per-se. The way it reads to me is the sister is hurt by the *reason given by the aunt* for the exclusion.\n\nIt wasn't - this is an expensive graduation gift so we are only taking the grad.\n\nIt was - we're not taking you because you didn't visit us as a child when you had no control over it", "Why would she not be invited? It's not just OP, it's all the other cousins as well. Only the sister is being excluded, and only because as a child she didn't do enough to make her aunt feel special.", "That's how I read it too : aunt, uncle, and their kid, and OP gets to go because she just graduated. No one else on Dad's side was invited, so I'm unclear why this trip is seen as such a horrible thing being done to her sister. What am I missing?", "Honestly, I don't understand people. The post? I understand it fine, so did you.\n\nWhat a world \ud83e\uddf9 \ud83e\udddf", "THANK YOU! Jesus.", "That is exactly what she said!  Sister wasn't around for her graduation! NTA!", "Exactly!  Why would they be obligated to include anyone else? Besides, they didn't know her, until she was grown, more or less.  While they can develope a good relationship, it's not going to be as close as it is with the graduate.NAH.  the girl is disappointed, but Aunt,Uncle, and little sister have done nothing wrong.", "It sounds like it may have been for OP's graduation, but it sounds like it's a big family trip, not just OP and aunt and uncle.", "\u201cThat would be an opinion not having a say\u201d?\n\nThis is hilarious. Hats off to you!", "agree 100% NAH\n\nBUT ALSO \n\n\ni felt this one a personal level. \n\nthere are three girls on my dads side. my cousin abbey, becca, and me. (i now identify as nb but its w/e.) my grandmother always tried to put becca and i into the same box as abbey even though we are all three different people. \n\nthey would do stuff without me and say theyre \u201cchristmas gifts for everyone.\u201d meanwhile i got jack shit. \n\ni know i sound entitled, and maybe i am, but it fucked me up how they treated me since i was a kid. you cant show that much favoritism. at all. it will ruin you no matter how old you are. \n\nNAH, and i feel for both OP and the sister. OP had no control over what their aunt and uncle did and neither did their sister. HOWEVER! that is a whole ass decade. that is more than enough time to build a relationship with the sister and they still exclude her.", "My problem is this, if it was just the 4 going and nothing more than a graduation present then why keep it a secret? They didn\u2019t even give her the opportunity to be happy for op because she says that the sister didn\u2019t even care about going she was hurt about being excluded from even knowing. Sister might have even paid for herself to go but they flat out didn\u2019t want her there.", "The aunt and uncle have a kid together. OP\u2019s uncle and brother are related. So unless there is some crazy incest going on the OP\u2019s \u2018aunt\u2019 is technically an \u2018aunt in law\u2019 even if OP refer\u2019s to her as their aunt. \n\nI fail to see how this is confusing.", "\"Guilt tripping your teenage sister over not being included in her expensive graduation present isn't a normal emotional interaction for a 26 year-old\" was the point of my response. \n\nEveryone on here always talks about how kids don't owe their parents anything. What exactly is OP supposed to owe her sister? Y'all expecting her to refuse the trip? Confront her aunt & and uncle, who've helped raise her, and call them assholes?", "When kids have a shitty relationship with adults, I tend to blame the adults.", "We don't know if dad is watching from the sidelines he might have spoken to his brother and sil about this but it hasn't changed anything and he really can't force them to. Trying to prevent OP from going on a graduation trip could also backfire. OP is the asshole for not understanding her half sister's feelings but without more info on dad im hesitant to say he is doing nothing. I'd honestly give him credit for not involving OP in this situation over the years since divorce issues shouldn't be put on kids and the issue between half sister and aunt and uncle really wasn't OP's business. Now it's different and I hope dad is supportive of his older daughter.", "OP's dad isn't going. OP explicitly says it's the uncle's family and her.", "The story said the uncle booked it for his family and OP. So it implies his family as in wife and kids plus OP no mention of her dad going.\n\nAlso probably why the dad isn't mentioned more in this story.", "This is also my take. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know you as a kid. We only got to know you as the person you chose to be. Therefore, we are not going to include you in our definition of what makes family. Too bad we never told you any of that. Would\u2019ve really sucked if you thought we would have counted the last decade of effort you made as soon as you had a legal say.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s extremely mean and alienating. It blames her for something she never did, and it\u2019s a cyclical thing (we won\u2019t do things with you \u2014> doing things is how we get close but we\u2019re not close \u2014> so we won\u2019t do things with you). They\u2019re saying she can never, ever make it better. \n\nI got kicked out of my church and one of the things they banned me from was confession. Which means I\u2019m not repenting sin. Guess what they also have a problem with (and used as the reason I got kicked)?\n\nThat\u2019s what this story made me think about.", "The cousin they're talking about is uncle and aunt's kid, it's OP and the family not every other cousin minus half-sister.", "Does\u201dall the other cousins\u201d mean cousins outside the aunt and uncle\u2019s kids?  I read this as the trip is for OP\u2019s graduation and she\u2019s going with their family. Like, it\u2019s a family trip to Hawaii (parents and their kids) plus they are taking OP because she just graduated", "No it is the uncle's family and her, obviously he is gonna take his kids!", "You're either stupid or lying. OP explicitly says it's her uncle's family and her.", "Feom what I understand, it sounds like everyone knew about the Hawaii trip except OP's sister. So the aunt and uncle purposely chose to keep the sister out of the loop instead of making it clear at the start that the trip was just for them, their kids, and OP. \n\nSo the sister isn't upset that she's not been invited, she's upset that no one told her about the trip at all. The cousin apparently assumed the sister was invited, or at least knew about the trip, which is why they were surprised that the sister wasn't going.", "The problem is not the trip. The problem is that the sister was deeply hurt by what the aunt said to her (and rightly so.) Then OP agreed with that hurtful statement.", "You are missing the part where the aunt explained ***why*** they aren't taking OP's sister.\n\n\"Basically she said she\u2019s had time to think about that day and said our aunt told her that ***she\u2019s an afterthought*** ***because they didn\u2019t get to build a relationship with her when she was young***.\"\n\nIf it was \"this is a treat for the grad\", it would be fine. But it isn't. It's explicitly because the sister wasn't around enough when she lived with her mother, 4 hours away.", "OP explicitly says it's her uncle, his family, and her. Uncle, aunt, their kid (assuming it's just the one OP mentioned) and OP.", "Maybe they all expected this type of reaction because the sister automatically thought she should be invited even though context says it\u2019s a graduation present", "An aunt-in-law is the aunt of one's spouse. The woman your uncle is married to is just your aunt.", "She's a grown adult acting entitled to someone else's gift. It's not a family function", "It's not a day at Six Flags. It's a fucking trip to *Hawaii*.", "You could be right. I read OP's post as saying dad's side of the family was going on the trip, so that meant the father was going too. In which case, even if he pays for the other daughter himself, he should do it to make sure she can go. And I'd hope he'd go to his brother and SiL and let them know that he wasn't happy with them. But since we seem to have scared off OP, we'll likely never know.", "They banned you from CONFESSION??? Thus (according to their own beliefs) preventing you from being right with the church and right with God?!? The absolute gall! That's unjust by their own terms and you have every right to be pissed as hell.", "That's a heavy load my friend\n\nYou are worthy. You are worthwhile. You have value", "Since they didn't do anything when the sister graduated that doesn't really change the situation - they are continuing to show preferential treatment to one cousin over the other because they are assholes.", "And just as obviously, the one person who has been left out of everything for decades is upset that she's being left out once again. Obviously the aunt and uncle are very much assholes.", "I think it really depends on what \"my uncle, *his family*, and me\" means. Is this just aunt, uncle, and OP? Or is this aunt, uncle, cousins, siblings, nieces, nephews, and OP?\n\nThe half-sister isn't entitled to a trip no matter what the situation is, but if it's a big family trip and a lot of the family members are going, then she definitely has a right to be upset...not just because they aren't paying for her, but she wasn't even invited to pay her own way if she wanted to go.\n\nSadly, it sounds like no one in the family has handled this kindly no matter what. If it's a big family trip then the half-sister should have been invited, even if it was a case of \"the trip is going to be $x per person, and you'd need to pay for yourself if you want to go\". If it's just a small thing for OP, then that should have been explained to her, and she should have been reassured that she will always be included in big family events. This is a kid who's mom may have refused to let her see Dad's side of the family (OP's comment about \"she was supposed to come for summers but for whatever reason never did\" tells me it's very possible that the reason was mom didn't let her), and as soon as she was 17, and able to make her own decisions, she tried to connect with that side of the family. I can understand her needing reassurance that she's part of the family.", "So if speaking up doesn't result in an actual change, then by your logic there's no point in ever having an opinion because you can never be sure to sway anything or restore any kind of justice. May as well not object at all to injustice.", "For op to say that she didn\u2019t care about not going tells me that she must likely wouldn\u2019t have reacted that way if they told her. Even if she did, let her be the ah but be honest", "LOL, it's not about Hawaii.", "From the way I read it I think the trip is Uncle's family and OP because OP saya uncle booked a trip for his family and me so I don't think OP's dad is going along.", "Why would they have taken the sister on a trip when she graduated when they didn't even have a relationship with her at that time?", "No the only reason OP was invited was because of her graduation!", "I said he should share his opinion, but people should stop acting like it's certain to change anything because it's highly likely and possible it won't.

Well, I suppose that's only half true.", "OP was invited because the aunt & uncle love OP and see OP as family. They exclude OP's sister (from everything, not just one trip), because they don't love her and don't see her as family, because *as a small child* she did not buy her own plane tickets and come visit them.", "Are you purposefully leaving out every other thing that OP said? It literally isn't about the trip. Even OP said that sister didn't want to go.", "Yeah, everyone else here is definitely TAH and not you. That makes a lot of sense.", "Conscientous objection is important in making and keeping relationships intact when something unfair happens - it's part of how we express empathy. \n\nNot saying anything whenever something bad happens even when you disagree with it is not going to make you friends in the long run. The dad already wasn't there for his older daughter during her childhood - he's giving her more reasons to distrust him now by being silent, regardless of whether it could change anything.", "You are literally making it about race when there\u2019s no context in the post about race, yes it happens but not 100% some families are just assholes.
