Which he planned VERY last minute. \n\nHe picked me flowers, we saw lots of seals (my favorite animal,) he bought me two beautiful bracelets we saw on the way to find a restaurant, and walked a simple trail with a nice view. I realized he had made NO reservation before hand. Keep in mind we\u2019re in a very popular tourist beach where a lot of the restaurants are PACKED and require wait lists. But out of pure luck we found a restaurant that took us right in with no wait. \n\nWe got seated. We were there for maybe five minutes when he decided he wanted to go and use the restroom. I asked if he could wait till after we ordered, but he insisted he had to go right that second and told me his order. I ordered what he asked which was a burger. Waitress asked how I wanted it done and I said medium. When he got back I let him know how I got it cooked to make sure it was fine with him. He blew up and went on a whole rant about how disgusting it was because of the \u201cuncooked bacteria\u201d and told me that I was stupid for ordering it that way. I apologized and told him I could call the waitress back and ask her to cook it more. He refused and insisted it was fine with a smile.\n\n I watched him eat while making faces, which irritated me because he was obviously making them to get a reaction out of me. I ignored him and he then asked if I wanted to switch plates. I switched and finished the WHOLE burger just to prove a point.\n\nWhile we were waiting for the check a man came up to the table striking a conversation with my boyfriend. That whole time he was extremely close to me and making me uncomfortable. This man was obviously eyeing me and my boyfriend didn\u2019t do anything about it. I\u2019m very shy and didn\u2019t want to interact with him so I just kept my eyes forward and tried my best not to acknowledge him. Unfortunately the man stuck his hand in front of my face and said hi. I looked at his hand and out of pure fear of being attacked I quickly shook it and said hi back. He stared me down and ended up walking away. My boyfriend said nothing and we left.\n\nAfter we left he proceeded to ask why I shook his hand and got upset AT ME for interacting with the man. I apologized trying my best to avoid confrontation.\n\nWe went to a car meet and I asked if he could hand me my lipstick last minute. He got upset because I asked last minute apparently, while also trying to look good for other men. He started a whole big fight about everything I did \u201cwrong\u201d that day. And while we were yelling at each other he said \u201cJust stop being yourself\u201d which sent me into tears and he tried to take it back and say he meant the \u201cbad parts.\u201d He told me to stop crying because I\u2019m not a toddler. I just quietly apologized but sent him a long text in the morning asking to talk about it today when he gets back from work. \n\nSo was I the one who ruined the date?", "created_utc": 1690651214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cxn82/aita_for_ruining_a_date/", "score": 195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Which he planned VERY last minute. \n\nHe picked me flowers, we saw lots of seals (my favorite animal,) he bought me two beautiful bracelets we saw on the way to find a restaurant, and walked a simple trail with a nice view. I realized he had made NO reservation before hand. Keep in mind we\u2019re in a very popular tourist beach where a lot of the restaurants are PACKED and require wait lists. But out of pure luck we found a restaurant that took us right in with no wait. \n\nWe got seated. We were there for maybe five minutes when he decided he wanted to go and use the restroom. I asked if he could wait till after we ordered, but he insisted he had to go right that second and told me his order. I ordered what he asked which was a burger. Waitress asked how I wanted it done and I said medium. When he got back I let him know how I got it cooked to make sure it was fine with him. He blew up and went on a whole rant about how disgusting it was because of the \u201cuncooked bacteria\u201d and told me that I was stupid for ordering it that way. I apologized and told him I could call the waitress back and ask her to cook it more. He refused and insisted it was fine with a smile.\n\n I watched him eat while making faces, which irritated me because he was obviously making them to get a reaction out of me. I ignored him and he then asked if I wanted to switch plates. I switched and finished the WHOLE burger just to prove a point.\n\nWhile we were waiting for the check a man came up to the table striking a conversation with my boyfriend. That whole time he was extremely close to me and making me uncomfortable. This man was obviously eyeing me and my boyfriend didn\u2019t do anything about it. I\u2019m very shy and didn\u2019t want to interact with him so I just kept my eyes forward and tried my best not to acknowledge him. Unfortunately the man stuck his hand in front of my face and said hi. I looked at his hand and out of pure fear of being attacked I quickly shook it and said hi back. He stared me down and ended up walking away. My boyfriend said nothing and we left.\n\nAfter we left he proceeded to ask why I shook his hand and got upset AT ME for interacting with the man. I apologized trying my best to avoid confrontation.\n\nWe went to a car meet and I asked if he could hand me my lipstick last minute. He got upset because I asked last minute apparently, while also trying to look good for other men. He started a whole big fight about everything I did \u201cwrong\u201d that day. And while we were yelling at each other he said \u201cJust stop being yourself\u201d which sent me into tears and he tried to take it back and say he meant the \u201cbad parts.\u201d He told me to stop crying because I\u2019m not a toddler. I just quietly apologized but sent him a long text in the morning asking to talk about it today when he gets back from work. \n\nSo was I the one who ruined the date?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But he had the audacity to \u201cnot make a reservation\u201d. I would have been more put off had he as 1) it would dictate the food choice w/o my input 2) it would ruin the spontaneity of the trip. I can see a scenario where boyfriend was suggesting various places and OP was rejecting them due to a wait. Sounds like boyfriend had to pee (usually you have to be a paying customer to use the facilities at a popular beachside place). So it does not surprise me that once seated he immediately went to the bathroom. If I were boyfriend at this this point I might be frustrated.

If one were to ask boyfriend he might have been mad due to her weird standoff ish behavior. How does one ask for a last minute lipstick?  Did you arrive and when boyfriend opened the door to leave you said wait \u201chand me this lipstick-what was it in his pocket?\u201d  And then sit there in the car fixing hair and makeup for 2-3 minutes ?
