Obviously you were harsh, but if it hasn\u2019t been brought up, it sounds like your stepmother has accepted what you said and doesn\u2019t want to broach it herself.

Both lose. That\u2019s really messed up. IMO. What was it to accomplish? She was pointing out that you wasted your money away. Not trying to poke fun at your mothers untimely passing. Low blow. It kinda sounds like she ruffles your feathers. Also people can be AH and still be right about things. Maybe you did blow through your inheritance. Also maybe your step mom is a you know what.

I think an apology is in order---not so much for her sake as it is for you to move on with a clean conscience. Also: is low-contact an option?
