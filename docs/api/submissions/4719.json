Like when he was expecting me to join? \n\nI don't know what he was thinking, the shower reeked, and he'd just peed on the wall that isn't even near the drain, and that has rough shaped natural stone tiles that are hard to clean. \n\nI yelled at him to use the damn toilet and he just kept peeing on the wall??? Till he stopped, and I was like \"What the fuck are you doing\" and he was like \"Don't pretend you don't pee in the shower\" and I told him I literally don't, I piss in the toilet. And hell, even if he acts like that at home, why'd he think it's alright to piss on my fuckin wall? \n\nHe was being all condescending like \"calm down\" and \"girl chill\" and of course being to calm down never works. I was like \"Don't fuckin tell me to calm down, go clean up after yourself and get out\" and I grabbed a bottle of bathroom tub and tile cleaner and gave it to him. \n\nI left him alone to clean up and he came out like \"is this bleach?\" And I was like \"Nah it's tub cleaner\" and he said it smelled like bleach, and did I really just give him bleach to use on pee? Because you can't do that. \n\nI was like \"I genuinely don't give a fuck, that's the cleaner I got\"\n\nHe went to clean the bathroom and opened the window cause he was saying you can't use bleach on pee because of some chemicals? But anyway, after that, I told him to head out. \n\nI thought it was just super nasty and weird tbh. I don't know if this is weird for me but I'd be happy to have a whole relationship never seeing my partner's bathroom activities.. let alone after a few dates, without asking, wtf? And it's just so inconsiderate to not even think of cleanup? Like what idiot pees on the far wall of the shower where water doesn't even run over? On rough rock? Dude's just pissing on my walls at that point. \n\nSo to me it was pretty obviously nasty as hell and not cool. But I got a call from the mutual friend who introduced us saying he heard I kicked him out at 6am for peeing in the shower? I was like \"yeah\" and he was like \"And then you made him clean with bleach? Bleach on urine? That causes chlorine gas?\" And I was like \"how was I supposed to know that? I gave him my tub and tile cleaner\" \n\nMy friend told me I was out of line and he regretted introducing us because he figured I'd be chill. I was like \"dude would you be chill if I came by and pissed on your shit?\" \n\nHe said it's not pissing on my \"shit\" everyone pees in the shower. So does he.

Like \"hey are you comfortable with this\", warning each other first, etc. Bathroom habits are... intimate? It's something you need to figure out with your partner how much you're comfortable sharing/being aware of and find out what works. Like anything else in a relationship.

Yes, I pee in my shower, but on the bottom of the tub, ideally right beside the drain, not on the wall. Natural stone is porous, so it will absorb any liquid it comes in contact with. If he has smelly urine, that will be imbedded in the stone. And if he was expecting you to join him, that's especially nasty. I'd expect him to clean his filth up as well.", "Oh hell no! You are in no way an asshole! His behavior is disgusting, unhygienic, rude, gross, nasty, and absolutely disrespectful to you! \n\nWell done throwing him out.

And even then, I\u2019m not about to pee in other peoples showers, or in front of them!\n\nHe\u2019s gross.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t think there would be enough ammonia left in the pee residue when mixed with whatever amount of bleach might be in your shower cleaner to be dangerous.", "Wait... You're not supposed to pee on front of people you just met?\n\nThis is why I keep getting kicked out of gyms........ /S", "NTA. \n\nOne: everyone does not pee in the shower. And while it's safe enough with sealed surfaces like glazed ceramics, natural stone is porous and you really shouldn't pee on it.\n\nTwo: yes, bleach + ammonia = chlorine, but unless you have been concentrating your pee in the loo for weeks without flushing, it is not of a sufficient concentration to be dangerous.

Same thing. \n\nYou are NTA because he ITA for pretending to know chemistry.", "NTA. But, peeing in the shower is normal. You just don't do it in date's house and you don't do it on the fucking wall. Also, he needs to drink more water and maybe see a doctor. My pee is odorless and colorless because I drink 6-8 liters of water a day. But even my kid or my husband don't stink up when they pee with their 2 litters of water a day intake.", "NTA, but I'm surprised homeboy stayed to clean it. I would have told you to kick rocks and bounced.", "Ok so some fun facts here. Some people get freaked out about urine and bleach because you aren't supposed to mix bleach and ammonia. Thing is, human urine has such a tiny amount of ammonia (\\*Edited for correct word- it's been a long day\\*) it isn't going to cause a poisonous gas cloud.

You don\u2019t pee in someone else\u2019s shower, even if you do pee in the shower. Also, you don\u2019t piss on the wall, that will just splash back or run on your feet, you piss on the drain. The only reason to pee in the shower is the rare emergency and avoiding getting your floor wet by exiting the shower", "Nta the dude and your \u201cfriend\u201d are gross.

You installed tiles in your shower that don't drain (used to clean bathrooms for a living and you would be stunned at how much those textures retain and it's been a pet peeve ever since) and tried to create a chemical weapon at 6 am.  The fact that you didn't know that leads me to believe you aren't cleaning the stone effectively in the first place so you're the asshole too and you were a bigger asshole than he was.", "Even my cat aims for the drain when he pees in the shower.", "I purposefully pee in the shower and not the toilet so as to not waste water or put extra strain on water treatment plants/ sewer.
