When he was expecting me to come in with him?", "selftext": "I'd gone on a few dates with a guy Ben, who I met through mutual friends, and he'd stayed over my place last Friday. \n\nOn Saturday, he got up to shower and invited me to join him. But when I came in, the bathroom stunk like piss tbh. And he was literally standing in the shower pissing on the wall. Like when he was expecting me to join? \n\nI don't know what he was thinking, the shower reeked, and he'd just peed on the wall that isn't even near the drain, and that has rough shaped natural stone tiles that are hard to clean. \n\nI yelled at him to use the damn toilet and he just kept peeing on the wall??? Till he stopped, and I was like \"What the fuck are you doing\" and he was like \"Don't pretend you don't pee in the shower\" and I told him I literally don't, I piss in the toilet. And hell, even if he acts like that at home, why'd he think it's alright to piss on my fuckin wall? \n\nHe was being all condescending like \"calm down\" and \"girl chill\" and of course being to calm down never works. I was like \"Don't fuckin tell me to calm down, go clean up after yourself and get out\" and I grabbed a bottle of bathroom tub and tile cleaner and gave it to him. \n\nI left him alone to clean up and he came out like \"is this bleach?\" And I was like \"Nah it's tub cleaner\" and he said it smelled like bleach, and did I really just give him bleach to use on pee? Because you can't do that. \n\nI was like \"I genuinely don't give a fuck, that's the cleaner I got\"\n\nHe went to clean the bathroom and opened the window cause he was saying you can't use bleach on pee because of some chemicals? But anyway, after that, I told him to head out. \n\nI thought it was just super nasty and weird tbh. I don't know if this is weird for me but I'd be happy to have a whole relationship never seeing my partner's bathroom activities.. let alone after a few dates, without asking, wtf? And it's just so inconsiderate to not even think of cleanup? Like what idiot pees on the far wall of the shower where water doesn't even run over? On rough rock? Dude's just pissing on my walls at that point. \n\nSo to me it was pretty obviously nasty as hell and not cool. But I got a call from the mutual friend who introduced us saying he heard I kicked him out at 6am for peeing in the shower? I was like \"yeah\" and he was like \"And then you made him clean with bleach? Bleach on urine? That causes chlorine gas?\" And I was like \"how was I supposed to know that? I gave him my tub and tile cleaner\" \n\nMy friend told me I was out of line and he regretted introducing us because he figured I'd be chill. I was like \"dude would you be chill if I came by and pissed on your shit?\" \n\nHe said it's not pissing on my \"shit\" everyone pees in the shower. So does he.

This is something you do with a partner when you reach that stage, not in the first dates.  Furthermore, I aim for the drain.

Your friend is also very confused tbh", "Everyone that I've ever met that openly talks about peeing in the shower honestly believes that everybody does it.

Your house, your rules.  I do know people who admit to peeing in the shower, but I'm pretty sure they don't pee on the wall.  \n\n\nThe thing about bleach is that urine has ammonia in it.

Peeing in the shower regardless if \"everyone\" does it, is at the very least wrong to do on the wall your describing, but personally even if I did pee in the shower I wouldn't pee in someone else's without permission or like some emergency.
