Either go to support her or make clear that after all she did to you, you don't have the energy to convince yourself to go.

I'm sure she just wants to use you as her trophy daughter and show no remorse.", "As long as you don't commit to this plan, NTA. If you do go along with the ruse, you know it yourself, you'll be the Ashhole. You don't even have to justify yourself, if anything just say no.", "NTA  yet.   It's normal to think about it but you're not your mom.  You're a much nicer person so please don't do it.  You'll be the one who feels the worst because you stooped to her level.  Just tell her you're not able but you wish her happiness.", "ESH\n\n\nIf it's shitty when she does it it's shitty when you do it. \n\nJust tell her you won't be there.  You don't want to be like her.", "Yeah, YTA. Don't do it. Doing that sort of thing would, in a sense, hurt you more than it would hurt your mom, because it would turn you into the sort of person you don't want to be. She's living in your head, rent-free. Instead, send her flowers on that day.", "No don't do it you don't want to be that person right? YTA because you haven't done anything but you WBTA. think about it and then say straight away yes or no. Maybe she will learn.", "ESH. It\u2019s shit that she does this to you and I understand the anger and disappointment, but doing it to her is just going to worsen the relationship.\n\nHave you talked to her about this?", "NTA kinda of like one sided important happenings. Find out what it is first and make that determination after.", "ETA. Have you considered discussing how bad she made you feel by never showing up to any of your special occasions, and follow up with \"so why should I attend yours?\"\n\nI don't know what the circumstances are, but I'm guessing maybe she wasn't present when you were growing up and now she's getting remarried and wants you there. And if that's the case, if someone doesn't put in the time or energy, you don't owe them anything. You're allowed to cut off toxic parents if it helps your well being. If it's worth it to you keep her in your life, then go. Otherwise, use this as an opportunity to cut her out.", "i think telling her you won't be there without any explanations would be ok. No need to tell her you will come and not show up then, it's indeed an ah move, but feeding her her own way, but more honestly, might really make you feel better about this whole thing.", "Nice response. Long term thinking and advocating for yourself while trying to do the best you can for others at the same time. Sometimes it's a fine line to walk, but walk it we must.", "Yes I did but she does not want to aknowledge that she did that\u2026 so it\u2019s often a never ending discussion when I point it out and I thought that by doing it to her would make her realize that what she did was wrong but I don\u2019t want to be the final asshole so I will just leave it \ud83e\udd37", "NTA and do it. She deserve nothing from you at this point. If they go low.. You go lower. Good luck", "NTA", "YWBTA\n\nI get the deep, unquenching need to be petty, but it will not be effective for actual change from her. Instead, tell her \\*exactly\\* why you will not be attending. Say that over the years you've been disappointed time and time again because of her behavior, and instead of spending your time and money traveling for her, when she wouldn't do the same for you, you will not attend but wish her the best", "don't feel obligated to give attention to your mom if she is toxic for you. You had given her too many attention IMHO.", "NTA\n\nYou reap what you sow. \n\nIf feeling petty, say that you will put in the same effort of attending her event as she did for all of yours.", "NTA, but don't do it.\n\nIt won't change her behavior and she won't magically apologize for doing it.  \n\nBut I would tell her that you thought of doing it but decided that she wasn't worth the effort of even trying to make a point.  Because she really isn't.", "Eye for an eye and all that but at the end of the day, you will feel so guilty (bc you understand how terrible it feels) that you won't even feel a pang of satisfaction.

But you need to face & accept the consequences!! NTA", "NTA... yet.\n\n  \nDon't inflict what was done to you onto others. Sometimes these ideas are better kept within our heads solely; it helps to deal with the anger and disappointment you clearly still feel... but be levelheaded, be a better person and if you are up to it, explain you're not coming because you don't understand why you should considering she wasn't there for you, and you do not have the money to spend. \n\nSometimes when we return hurt, we end up hurt all over again ourselves... be aware that coming from a place of anger, disappointment, and pain is NEVER EVER going to give you good decisions or the ability to move on. Don't fall into that trap - you'll regret it.", "NTA, but don't do it.\n\nJust tell her no.  And if you're up for it, tell her why.  Don't play the same games she does that you dislike.  That's putting yourself in a position where you don't like your own actions.  Live in a way you like yourself.  Take her out of the equation, do you think behaving that way would feel good?  Would it feel justified or would it leave you feeling queasy?   It would be understandable to treat her as she treated you, but the question isn't whether she deserves it but whether you deserve to dislike yourself over it.  Because you will feel guilty about it, you already do and you've only thought about it.", "DO IT", "NTA", "YTA if you did that\n\nBut not if you just decline with no reason, as she has."]}
