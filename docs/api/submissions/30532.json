That sounds like a great idea. NTA. Use your resources while you have them", "NTA.    Getting interview ready is a job.", "I live in the north, if I got a kid they would be in kindergarten every day even though I most likely would not work. It\u2019s crucial for their development to be around other kids and something new happening every day which I wouldn\u2019t be able to do with them. I remember we got a little kid from I think it was Pakistani that was of the older group and she would hang around the adults and not play with the other kids unless a adult was present or sat beside her because she had only been at home until her mother came to our country and didn\u2019t know how to play with the other kids.", "NTA\n\nAnd in fact, starting daycare one day a week is a great way to help your child gently adjust to being away from you and a new schedule/place rather than suddenly starting her full-time when you go back to work.  So really, I think this is a solution that will benefit everyone: your daughter will get a lead in time where she can get used to going to daycare and get comfortable with her new caregiver before going full time and you'll have more ability to concentrate on your job search.", "You need to find balance. And if something is a priority, you need to find a way to make it happen. Do you, working will be a priority, and to get to that point you need to put some work on now. It is also your priority to make sure your daughter is cared for. And while yes, your mom is there and can help, it\u2019s still not at a point where you feel you can have other priorities. \n\nSo I guess my suggestion would be if you need to work to get those things done and can\u2019t do so as your daughter is at home and you feel torn about spending time with her. As your mom to take her out. Sign her up for swimming lessons or toddler play time or any magnitude of things. Get your mom to take her so that you have those times to work guilt free. If you are already doing that, then tell them that while those things are great, you need a longer period of dedicated time. Because an hour here and two hours there isn\u2019t enough to be productive. They might be better able to understand the need of a day when it\u2019s not broken into segments. \nThis isn\u2019t about not wanting your daughter around. This is about you wanting to spend time with her, but not being able to give your full attention to her and the tasks that need to be done at the same time. It\u2019s a hard task as a parent. \n\nNTA.", "NTA for a day or two a week as long as you are treating the job hunt seriously and spending full-time hours on it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get it from the viewpoint of wanting to socialize the baby and get her ready for a more active schedule. But I also get that it seems odd to pay for more childcare when you already have someone to watch the baby for free.", "Absolutely NTA! Daycare is actually fantastic for a child\u2019s development. Don\u2019t let anyone mom shame you!", "NTA I'd even point out to your husband that he's coming off as controlling in this post if that's not how he normally acts and either way set the boundary that you WILL be rejoining the workforce and this isn't gonna devolve into you being the stay at home mom without an income because it almost seems as if he doesn't want you to find a new job", "NTA. Do it for your daughter\u2019s socialization if nothing else. As long as there are other kids present in a licensed daycare, then what you do with the extra time is irrelevant.", "NTA and I get it.  Job hunting is difficult.\n\nIf you don't get the support you need, can you leave the house for a day and work on your portfolio in a cafe, library, or some other place?", "NTA - daycare is great for the social development of a toddler. playing, interacting and learning with other kids is a great thing and prepares them for kindergarden/school", "I don't have a child but I found it extremely difficult to focus when I was in the thick of my job hunt. If you can afford it do it! Doesn't make you a bad mom. You trying to find work to support your family. NTA.", "You are NOT being a bad mom. Sending a child to day care does not make you a bad mom. Needing one day a week that you can dedicate to your career development or to yourself is not selfish or neglectful. Being able to focus on yourself for a few hours will probably make you a better mom! \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nJob hunting/applying/interviewing is a job in itself if you are committed and taking it seriously. The others do not realize this.\n\nIf you have the money and resources, then use them (mom helping with raising and daycare)\n\nYou are not a bad mom, you are working hard to get back to work and provide for your family", "NTA. Does your husband and/or your mom want you to stay unemployed and become a stay-at-home mother? They do not seem to be supportive of your job search.  If they are unhappy with the daycare idea, try to carve out some hours everyday for yourself (11-2 for example) and ask your mother to not disturb you between those hours. If she is unwilling, circle back to the daycare idea.", "NTA but if they are not on board, and they are preventing you, can you leave the house for one day a week and find a quiet place to work on your portfolio?", "NTA\n\nFirst- job hunting, preparing, putting everything together is a full time job. Your hubby doesn't believe you...tell him to try it with everything going on around him at the level you need to to find a good role in your field. Tell him to put together a resume, update his LinkedIn, apply for a bunch of high end jobs all while you, LO, and MIL are on him and being loud and needy. \n\nSecond- your mom is only a resource until the end of February and it seems that her expectations have changed given your current lack of employment. While you should still be spending more time with LO and it sounds like you are I'm assuming you're providing for Mom with the agreement she is helping provide for LO. Like a nanny of sorts. A nanny doesn't get the time off just because Mom is off unless it's their time off.\n\nThird- If at the end of February the assumption is LO has to go to daycare anyway because Mom is not going to be a resource it makes a lot of sense to have her acclimate to it ahead of time while someone has the ability to pick her up if she's having a tough time at the beginning. It would really suck for you to start a new job and then have attendance issues because LO needs someone to come get her. Is hubby going to do that?", "NTA\n\nLooking for a job is tiring and if you can afford it what's the harm?", "Absolutely NTA.  I WFH and when my kids (5&8) we're home with me every day in August, it was tough.  Taking one day a week to work on your job search is perfectly reasonable and I would do the same.", "NTA. If you need childcare for a socially acceptable reason, get it. If you need childcare because want some time to yourself, get it. Sometimes it\u2019s really great to hand your little ones over to professional kind people without the burden of gratitude. There is ALWAYS guilt, but that\u2019s parenting for you. I did full time for my kids in stages when they were small even when I didn\u2019t always work five days. That other day to get shit done and maybe go for a coffee and enjoy the silence kept me sane.", "I work in daycare, and to be honest 1x week is not enough. She will struggle with adjusting to all the new faces at only 1x week. I would do 3x week for the social aspect alone. At 3x week she will adjust better to a full time schedule if your plan is to go back full time to your career. If you can send your kids to any care program in your community is beneficial. It helps them adjust, grow, and expand their minds, bodies, and personalities. I think you should go for it dear!!", "NTA once a week is very reasonable especially since you found a woman in your neighborhood. A different solution could be your \u201cwfh\u201d hours. If your mom could be trusted to respect a two hour per day or three hours two days a week work schedule, that could also work but it would have to be a hard boundary. If she can\u2019t, daycare neighbor", "NTA, if the industry you seek work in needs an updated portfolio and your husband and mom aren't helping you accomplish this, you have a right to put the child in daycare once a week to get it done. Nothing bad mom about it.", "Nta", "NTA you need to do whatever allows you to focus on your job search. Bringing your daughter to daycare would allow you to lift part of the burden of the house chores from your mother: are you sure that she understands it and is ok with looking after your daughter more, in exchange?", "NTA \nMost day care have 1/2 day or selected week day for this reason.\nGive parents a break, weird work schedule, wet their feet on a structured/outside the house environment.\nI will actually suggest you put her 3 days a week! 1 day can actually be an hassle for her while 3 days (if you can afford) will give a good balance of understanding a new routine for her and give you more time to focus on task and then even on your daughter on your free time!", "NTA\n\nPerhaps you can take your laptop and go to the library, a mall, someplace with WiFi access once day a week and let your mom/hubby handle life during that time. That might swing them around to the daycare idea.", "NTA: other than what other users already said, going to the daycare is great for children to develop social skills", "Work first use your own money for daycare what I recommend that your mom and husband won\u2019t throw it at your face that it not your money that you use for daycare", "Nta. Am in similar situation. My kid is already in care, and we are keeping her at least 2 days a week to give me time to look for work. Trying to get CV, LinkedIn, cover letters,  engage with recruiters and network - takes time. Your focus cant be on kid and this next stage. If you don't want to go down daycare route block time off weekly to job hunt and send your mum and bub on a grandma and baby date (i.e maybe send them to zoo or movie ect, so it becomes a thing they can do together and it buys you peace) \n\nBest of luck with job hunt.", "NTA \n\nOne day a week is great. You may not be working outside the home but that doesn't mean you don't need some business hours alone. \n\nMost business' still run by the standard 9-5. There are some things you can't do with a baby, or is made significantly harder to do with a kiddo in tow. \n\nBoth my kids were in day care 1 day a week. Both for them and for me. \n\nIt benefits them socially, making friends and also lets them know there are other safe adults other than their dad and I. \n\nIt gave me a chance to get things done from dr appts, shopping, other appointments etc. it also gave me some much needed silence.", "NTA & you sound like a great mom. it\u2019s very difficult to focus, especially once you have a child and you\u2019re probably the answer person for your mom and your focus interrupted.", "NTA... if you can afford it, there is nothing wrong with your plan. One day a week is a good trial run.", "INFO is there a chance that he doesn't *want* you to get a job?", "NTA.\n\nConvenient that other people are making claims for your time. Is there a reason they can't handle covering the day, since it's so important?", "NTA in fact I think you are being practical here.  Your mother is moving out in February and will no longer be able to help you.  You want to go back to work.  Your child will have to start daycare at some point. \n\nQuestion to ask though is if your husband wants you to be a SAHM since he doesn\u2019t want daycare to happen. If he is resistant to Daycare when you aren\u2019t working now how will he accept Daycare when you go back to work. \n\nI suspect that is the real underlying issue at play.", "NTA. If your mom is living there, presumably for free, she should be providing childcare so your can do what's needed to get a job. I think you need to set stronger boundaries with your mom and husband.", "It does, but that might be a hard schedule for your daughter.  It might be hard to acclimate to a different environment just once a week (if you can even find a daycare that will allow that schedule).\n\nYou might do the reverse and you leave the house and work at the local library for x hours a day.", "Thank you for sharing this! That's a very good point. She is shy with other kids too. That's part of the reason I want to do it as well.", "Thanks for pointing that out. I had similar thoughts.", "NTA - yes leave the house. don't be guilted by your mom and husband. you need to treat job search like a job otherwise you will become stuck.", "These are all very good points. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts.", "You are not a bad Mom for wanting her to attend daycare while you work and update your portfolio. \n\nEither your husband gets on board or else I think you should be leaving at least once a week to work on your portfolio out of the house where you can\u2019t be bothered.\n\nETA: and I say this as a SAHM whose kid never was in daycare. There is nothing wrong with sending your child somewhere because you need a break or need to work. Socialization is extremely important.", "If places won't do daycare one day a week, you could sign her up for toddler activities like gymnastics or parent & me (or grandparent & me) swim classes for socialization. This doesn't address your need for a day to focus on cleaning/job hunting, of course. Maybe try to set up a schedule with your mom of 2-4 hours a day (or 1-2 days a week) where you're focused on non-childcare, if you two haven't been as structured as that so far?"]}
