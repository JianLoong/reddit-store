She ditched her own 13-year-old child to be with her boyfriend and now she's complaining about YOU because she doesn't like the way you stepped in??\n\nYour sister needs a majority reality check.  \n\nI don't believe kids should be spoiled but you did nothing wrong.  A guidebook, a toy and two items of clothing are not at all excessive.  The clothes will be useful and if he'll read the book, then good on you for finding him something that will encourage his reading.  \n\nYour sister clearly has issues.  I hope you will continue being there for this poor kid.  Sounds like he needs a stable, loving presence in his life. NTA.", "NTA. She chose her boyfriend\u2019s birthday over her child\u2019s. If she wanted something more restrained she could have let the adult man celebrate on a different day and spent the day with him.", "It's fine, her sending her kid away so she can spend her kid's birthday with her boyfriend will balance out the sense of entitlement.\n\nNtA. \n\nGood on you for spoiling your nephew! We all need it sometime.", "NTA. She wanted to hang with her BF instead of her kid on her kid\u2019s birthday. Indulging him a little won\u2019t make him entitled, and it sounds like the kiddo deserved a little spoiling. It was his birthday FFS.", "You're NTA but your sister is, big time - how can she put her boyfriend so blatantly before her son?? How about at least having a party together?? How about she and the boyfriend as the adults organize a party for the kid where the bf's birthday can also be acknowledged?? What's wrong with these people??\n\nNo worries about buying him \"too many\" toys - his mum is balancing out any feeling of entitlement that he could ever develop...and I wouldn't even accept any criticism from my sister if she dumped her kid on me so selfishly.", "NTA I doubt he\u2019ll become entitled when his own mum puts her boyfriends birthday above her own child\u2019s. Is she just mad that she maybe didn\u2019t get him anything or got him something small and her boyfriend a better gift?\nHe clearly enjoyed his day out with you, just remind your sister she wanted to celebrate with her boyfriend and not her own kid turning 13, so you were celebrating him", "NTA. You spent a wonderful day with your nephew and bought him some gifts. Your sister is overreacting and making a mountain over an ant hill. Assuming you did not spend a disproportionate amount, I cannot say if she is having issues with her son in general, but its your gift to give.", "NTA\n\nIt's not that you brought your nephew a Ferrari or a Rolex. It was his birthday, he had the right to a treat.", "Nta!!!! I love when my sisters spoil my kids like that. As a parent it makes it easier to give them more practical gifts like nice shoes, or a new jacket.", "NTA: you were a nice aunt/uncle paying attention to your nephew while his mom was ignoring his birthday. There's no risk of that kid growing up \"spoiled\".", "NTA. Your sister decided to skip celebrating with HER son to celebrate with her bf instead. She should be happy someone was willing to step up for her son. If she thought that was over the top she would have had a stroke with my family. We would have gone to the aquarium, given gifts (aside from gift shop purchases) and gone out to a a very nice dinner followed by cake. Children deserve to be spoiled in their birthdays.", "NTA. It's hard to be spoiled when your mom cares more about her boyfriend than you. I mean damn, therapy might have been the better gift here.", "NTA. Your sister is overreacting. It takes more than a couple t-shirts to make an entitled child", "NTA. Honestly it doesn\u2019t sound like you spoiled the kid. An outing and one toy is perfectly reasonable. I can\u2019t imagine why any parent would be mad about clothes & a book. Well maybe clothes if they weren\u2019t age appropriate or the parents didn\u2019t want to feed into brand name worship/ materialism but neither applies here.", "The kid is lucky to have you. You took him out and \u201cspoiled\u201d him (OMG!), on his *birthday*, while his mother celebrated her BF\u2019s birthday, elsewhere. \n\nHis mother should have thanked you. His mother is jealous that whatever, (if anything), she did to celebrate her own child\u2019s birthday-paled by comparison. Sucks for her. NTA", "NTA\n\n\"Take my kid out on his birthday so that I, his mother, don't have to spend energy on him that I'd rather spend on my boyfriend. But don't buy him presents because he'll become entitled\"\n\nThe kid *is* entitled to attention from his mom but seems like she won't even indulge that. What a delight.", "Your sister is a MAJOR AH\n\nFirst she dumps her kid on his birthday, to be with her Bf!?! \nThen has the audacity of saying he\u2019ll become entitled because you gave him nice gifts on his birthday.\n\n And no what you got him was not a lot. It was the perfect for an aunt/uncle to treat her/his nephew. And that\u2019s what birthdays are for- to be spoilt by those around you. Poor kid.", "NTA- it\u2019s his birthday and his mom couldn\u2019t be bothered to spend the day with him. A few gifts, that would be well within normal for close family to give, is not spoiling. If this was a regular thing, sure. But not on a special occasion combined with his mom ditching him. I\u2019m sure the few gifts you gave made whatever trinket she gifted him look really pathetic and that\u2019s why she\u2019s mad. She sounds like a Grade-A AH.", "NTA, his own mother didn't even spend the day with him on his birthday, sus behaviour.\n\nGlad he he has you to take him out for a fun day and a few treats!", "NTA. Mom sucks for celebrating birthday with her boyfriend and not doing something for HER child.", "NTA, any bets that most of mom's money was spent spoiling her boyfriend and now she's realizing whatever cheap gift she bought a a consolation prize for her son looks shabby in comparison to your gifts?", "NTA\n\nThe bigger issue is a mother ditching her son on his birthday to be with her boyfriend.\n\nShe has no right to be angry with you for not failing this kid.", "NTA, my kids\u2019 grandparents, aunts and uncles spoil them on occasion (birthdays and holidays typically) even now (17 and 19). They aren\u2019t entitled brats. Parenting involves making sure your kids know how to appreciate gifts when given without expecting gifts every time. As you stated, the shirts are practical too. Taking a 13 year old to a special place for a birthday and getting a few souvenirs to bring home isn\u2019t over the top.", "I consider spoiling the kids to be my primary duty as their aunt.  Their parents have to spend tons of money on everything it takes to raise a kid and the super expensive birthday or Christmas gift may be a budget buster.  Hubs and I are child free.  We call it our \"kids budget\", the kids are thrilled, and the parents are super happy that they don't have to explain to whiny children why they can't afford a luxury item after paying for groceries (one is a 17 yo athlete who's been going through a growth spurt for what feels like 3 years) travel sports, school uniforms, etc that month.  NTA if this is a birthday gift and not an everyday occurrence or some kind of power play \"I like auntie better because she buys me xyz\"", "NTA and also, this poor kid is 13.

She's being unreasonable and quite frankly an absolutely horrible neglectful parent.", "Nope not in the wrong. Your allowed to spoil you nephew every once in awhile.

Go ahead and spoil him a bit.  I spoil my next door neighbor's little girl terribly. I never had children, and she sees me as a bonus grandparent or pal in a way.

I spoil the hell out of my niece and nephew and they a) haven't turned into brats because aunt mermaid gave them craft projects, books and clothes and b) my sister has not once gotten angry at me for giving her kids anything.

I doubt he's getting the same message at home.", "The only thing she gave her own kid on his birthday was the boot. She should be thanking OP that they single-handedly stopped this birthday from being a bad memory by having a good day with him.

I think your nephew will need a lot more of your support and love in the near and distant future.", "Exactly! It sounds like the sister knows she messed up by not spending time with him and seeing how happy the son was by spending time with and getting gifts from OP instead of his own mother. Sounds like she is blaming OP to lessen her own guilt. The way she got mad at 4 small gifts makes me think that she probably didn't give him as much. Also, the son is 13 he is not that young, so there is a chance he may have said something to her about the way she was. Even if he didn't, im sure the guilt is probably still there. Because honestly, 4 gifts is not that much. My parents and relatives would give me more than that at times for my birthday and holidays and i know a lot of people that give their children 4 or more gifts for their birthday. She knows she's not being a good parent to him and is placing the blame elsewhere to make herself feel better.", "[removed]", "Simple kid brains also can't comprehend why the mum's bf's birthday is more important than the son's birthday and why he is being dumped on his auntie so he's out of the house for the adults to have a good time. I would start there if we want to evaluate the situation - looking at it from THE KID's perspective.", "Mom is only upset because she chose her BF over her son on his birthday and his aunt/uncle showed up for him. She feels guilty, rightfully so and hopefully she changes her attitude next time. NTA.", "I respectfully disagree. I don\u2019t think she feels one ounce of guilt, I just don\u2019t think she wants her son to feel \u201centitled\u201d, i.e. believing he deserves attention, respect and love.", "Yes, I agree.  Sounds like she is pretending the OP has done something wrong so that she doesn't have to confront the fact that she ditched her own child on his birthday.  \n\nAnd yes--these were all very modest gifts, not playstations or trips to Disneyland.", "Definitely. OP should call her on it."]}
