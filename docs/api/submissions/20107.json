I love going out to eat and buying things but I also save up for these things. \n\nI recently made a friend who I\u2019ll call Minnie. A few times I\u2019ve treated her because I asked her to come with me to restaurants. Anyway, one day Minnie invited me somewhere so since I\u2019ve paid for her in the past I thought she would cover me. I ordered something cheap that was about $10 and i had a water and she got herself about $40 worth of food. \n\nWhen the check comes she hands it to me and tells me that she only have $11. I was so confused. If you only have $11 why order almost 4 times the amount in food? \n\nI covered the tab. \n\nThen it happened again on my birthday. She ordered food but also didn\u2019t have money so I paid. She invited me over for dinner and when I got there she told me I needed to help pay for the chicken she wanted to make and then told me to go to the store. I went back home and got 2 left over chicken thighs I had and gave them to her and she was upset but said it will do. \n\nThen one day while I solo at a restaurant she and her husband showed up and sat with me. I had a feeling she might do this again but I only had a gift card to that place and my phone (the place doesn\u2019t take Apple Pay) the check comes and she tells the waitress to cut it down the middle. I immediately said no because I only order $18 worth of food and plan to use the rest of my $25 gift card for a tip. She was shocked & asked me how she was going to pay for her almost $90 order. \n\nShe huffed and told her husband to use the credit card. Apparently she told him I would help cover the bill so he got mad at me for \u201ctaking it back\u201d - I never said I would pay for them \n\nThen this morning she asked me if we were going out to lunch. I told her no because I know she would find a way to make me pay again & then I told her I won\u2019t go anywhere else with her until she actually has her own money.\n\nShe has since been ignoring me and I\u2019m perfectly okay with this friendship ending & told her that this friendship isn\u2019t worth it and to stop talking to me all together. Later in the day her husband messaged me and told me that I was an asshole for hurting her feelings and that friends treat friends. He mention how she would cook for me and I said \u201cyes with food that I bought and shared with the two of you\u201d \n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything else other than telling me I was rude and only valued money. \n\nSo tell me, was I the asshole for saying this to her or could I have be \u201cnicer\u201d about it.", "created_utc": 1687229625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dyxvn/aita_for_telling_my_friends_i_wont_hang_out_with/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's using you to eat well. My advice - the friendship isn't worth the literal cost.", "Nta\n\nBut the friendship isn't over, there never was a friendship. She's been using you since day one, and now that the free ride is over she's done with you.", "NTA.  Also she\u2019s not your friend.  I wouldn\u2019t even bother telling her to pay her own way.  I\u2019d cut her out of your life completely.  Do you really want to be friends with someone who is that shitty of a human being?", "NTA and woah wtf. I had a friend like that but she was never this bad. I would always treat her when I invited her out, but any time she whipped out an \"I got it\" for me she would always venmo request me the next day. It got so annoying I simply stopped hanging out with her", "NTA. The only crime was that you still hang with her after the meal that she ordered $40 and you ordered $10.", "NTA. This chick was using you, she was not your friend.", "NTA, she's not really a friend, just using you for some free meals.\n\nMy dad had a \"friend,\" not quite as bad as yours but he used to visit round about lunch time and get some food. My dad would offer him some of what he was making. Then one day he stopped offering, and the \"friend\" stopped visiting. He only saw his friendship as a way to get some free meals.", "NTA. It's a given that if you invite someone out to eat that you'll pay for at least your own portion of food. It's even worse that she would do this to you on your birthday, and invite you over for dinner only to make YOU pay for the ingredients and go to the store and buy them yourself. Who does this?? She's obviously just using you. You definitely need to end this \"friendship\" if you can even call it that.", "NTA\n\nShe was using you. The second the money went out, she is gone and has her husband on your case. Friends treat friends? She never treated you. They're leeches.", "NTA. She\u2019s bold to openly invite herself to your money like this. This one\u2019s wild lol. Usually people will take advantage but only when you open the door for them, they don\u2019t usually just kick it in every two seconds like that lol.", "NTA. Also you should tell the husband that you haven't been comfortable with paying for all these meals and not only didn't agree to, but have expressed discomfort numerous times during these situations. \n\nAlso, even if sharing a bill, I would never order $90 worth of food if the other person only ordered $18 bucks-worth.

I\u2019m glad you put your foot down, and you didn\u2019t need to be nicer about it. Why would you need to beat around the bush when she certainly wasn\u2019t beating around the bush to make you pay. Her useless husband can bite it too, who does he think he is to talk to you like that anyway? They\u2019re both leeches, good riddance.", "You should get as far away from this moocher as possible.  This type of person will use you and give nothing in return. Run away. NTA", "ESH. She for obvious reasons and you for tolerating this for so long. \"Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.\"\n\nYou haven't lost a friend. She was never one.", "NTA- You don\u2019t need either of these mooches in your life.", ">So tell me, was I the asshole for saying this to her or could I have be \u201cnicer\u201d about it.\n\nNTA. If you had said it any nicer, her and her husband's hands would still be in your pocket, taking your money away from you and your daughter. \n\n>He didn\u2019t say anything else other than telling me I was rude and only valued money.\n\nOnly because you never saw any of theirs... someone had to value yours.", "NTA\n\nMinnie is a complete moocher, not a friend.

She\u2019s been using you for your entire \u201cfriendship.\u201d You had no obligation to be nice, considering the amount of times that she took advantage of you. Good for you for putting your foot down. I hope you find a better friend who can actually pay for themselves, and hopefully you also, at lunch.", "This woman is a leech and was never your friend. You're better off without her and will find someone who will value your friendship for more than just money.  NTA", "Nta She was taking advantage of you.  Friends don\u2019t treat friends like that.", "NTA that's a shitty thing for her to do and it sounds like she is using you", "Wow\u2026 You were way nicer than you should\u2019ve been.
