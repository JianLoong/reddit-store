I love going out to eat and buying things but I also save up for these things. \n\nI recently made a friend who I\u2019ll call Minnie. A few times I\u2019ve treated her because I asked her to come with me to restaurants. Anyway, one day Minnie invited me somewhere so since I\u2019ve paid for her in the past I thought she would cover me. I ordered something cheap that was about $10 and i had a water and she got herself about $40 worth of food. \n\nWhen the check comes she hands it to me and tells me that she only have $11. I was so confused. If you only have $11 why order almost 4 times the amount in food? \n\nI covered the tab. \n\nThen it happened again on my birthday. She ordered food but also didn\u2019t have money so I paid. She invited me over for dinner and when I got there she told me I needed to help pay for the chicken she wanted to make and then told me to go to the store. I went back home and got 2 left over chicken thighs I had and gave them to her and she was upset but said it will do. \n\nThen one day while I solo at a restaurant she and her husband showed up and sat with me. I had a feeling she might do this again but I only had a gift card to that place and my phone (the place doesn\u2019t take Apple Pay) the check comes and she tells the waitress to cut it down the middle. I immediately said no because I only order $18 worth of food and plan to use the rest of my $25 gift card for a tip. She was shocked & asked me how she was going to pay for her almost $90 order. \n\nShe huffed and told her husband to use the credit card. Apparently she told him I would help cover the bill so he got mad at me for \u201ctaking it back\u201d - I never said I would pay for them \n\nThen this morning she asked me if we were going out to lunch. I told her no because I know she would find a way to make me pay again & then I told her I won\u2019t go anywhere else with her until she actually has her own money.\n\nShe has since been ignoring me and I\u2019m perfectly okay with this friendship ending & told her that this friendship isn\u2019t worth it and to stop talking to me all together. Later in the day her husband messaged me and told me that I was an asshole for hurting her feelings and that friends treat friends. He mention how she would cook for me and I said \u201cyes with food that I bought and shared with the two of you\u201d \n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything else other than telling me I was rude and only valued money. \n\nSo tell me, was I the asshole for saying this to her or could I have be \u201cnicer\u201d about it.", "created_utc": 1687229625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dyxvn/aita_for_telling_my_friends_i_wont_hang_out_with/", "score": 614, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd been working weekends since I was 14 and had saved almost all of it so had a tidy sum. We would go out and she would never pay, never buy coffees, never even offer for food.  I remember on more than one occasion her just handing me bills. We weren't dating or anything like that, so I came to the realisation I was being used as an ATM. One day we were discussing money and she said to me \"All you care about it money\", from someone who told me she changed jobs every 3 months because she 'got bored' and didn't pay any rent.\n\nSo the next time we went to the movies I went up with her ordered one ticket then stepped to the side and looked at her.
