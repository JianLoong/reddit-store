I love going out to eat and buying things but I also save up for these things. \n\nI recently made a friend who I\u2019ll call Minnie. A few times I\u2019ve treated her because I asked her to come with me to restaurants. Anyway, one day Minnie invited me somewhere so since I\u2019ve paid for her in the past I thought she would cover me. I ordered something cheap that was about $10 and i had a water and she got herself about $40 worth of food. \n\nWhen the check comes she hands it to me and tells me that she only have $11. I was so confused. If you only have $11 why order almost 4 times the amount in food? \n\nI covered the tab. \n\nThen it happened again on my birthday. She ordered food but also didn\u2019t have money so I paid. She invited me over for dinner and when I got there she told me I needed to help pay for the chicken she wanted to make and then told me to go to the store. I went back home and got 2 left over chicken thighs I had and gave them to her and she was upset but said it will do. \n\nThen one day while I solo at a restaurant she and her husband showed up and sat with me. I had a feeling she might do this again but I only had a gift card to that place and my phone (the place doesn\u2019t take Apple Pay) the check comes and she tells the waitress to cut it down the middle. I immediately said no because I only order $18 worth of food and plan to use the rest of my $25 gift card for a tip. She was shocked & asked me how she was going to pay for her almost $90 order. \n\nShe huffed and told her husband to use the credit card. Apparently she told him I would help cover the bill so he got mad at me for \u201ctaking it back\u201d - I never said I would pay for them \n\nThen this morning she asked me if we were going out to lunch. I told her no because I know she would find a way to make me pay again & then I told her I won\u2019t go anywhere else with her until she actually has her own money.\n\nShe has since been ignoring me and I\u2019m perfectly okay with this friendship ending & told her that this friendship isn\u2019t worth it and to stop talking to me all together. Later in the day her husband messaged me and told me that I was an asshole for hurting her feelings and that friends treat friends. He mention how she would cook for me and I said \u201cyes with food that I bought and shared with the two of you\u201d \n\nHe didn\u2019t say anything else other than telling me I was rude and only valued money. \n\nSo tell me, was I the asshole for saying this to her or could I have be \u201cnicer\u201d about it.", "created_utc": 1687229625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14dyxvn/aita_for_telling_my_friends_i_wont_hang_out_with/", "score": 3008, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I remember on more than one occasion her just handing me bills. We weren't dating or anything like that, so I came to the realisation I was being used as an ATM.

We were attached at the hip but I got a very good well paying job and she worked but she kinda hopped between minimum wage jobs. She and her husband  who also worked but minimal wage hopping had 2 kids in fairly quick order. I was a single woman, no kids, with a professional salary. (Intro professional, so not HUGE money, but quite well off given our age bracket). Your description is exactly the sort of thing that happened. It started with meals and drinks and gifts for her kids, then cash floats to buy some gas for her car. My friend even started describing me to others as \"my rich friend\", \"I'm super lucky because I have a rich friend\"... this was after I floated the money to throw them a huge pre-wedding party. Which I should state was a financial stretch for me, but I was counting on being re-paid. And at the beginning they did repay the things they owed me, but the repayments became less and less and less until once they bought car parts on my credit card, promising to repay before the payment was due. I've never seen the money. Our friendship took a 5 year hiatus and the language I used was no more gentle than yours... I was mad at her taking advantage of me, she was mad that I .... dun dun dunnnnn .... \"only cared about the money\". We had a big fight and didn't talk for years. \n\nBUT...  We are friends again now only because to be honest my income has gone way way up compared to theirs and the amount of money they owe me is inconsequential NOW and I (in a dorky kind of way) understand how hard it must have been to have a close friend with disposable income while you are struggling to pay bills and feed your kids.\n\nNTA. Your money is your money. the TLDR of my message is: your friendship MIGHT recover if you set boundaries NOW. The setting of boundaries might lead to the end of the friendship.
