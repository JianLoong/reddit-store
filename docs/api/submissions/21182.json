He\u2019s a really great guy and everyone in my family loves him except for my dad. My dad can\u2019t stand him but won\u2019t give anyone a reason. Also, my mom and dad don\u2019t have the best relationship. She goes to her best friends house across the street to drink and rant about how she married an idiot/jackass/child at least once a week and I\u2019d say one of them sleeps in the guest room at least that much. \n\nI was diagnosed with leukemia in September. Noah has been amazing over the past 10 months. He used to visit me at the hospital almost every day, brought my favorite foods and snacks, and set up dates that we can do from the hospital. Now that I\u2019m at home he still checks on me every day, comes over all the time, and he makes sure I have everything I want. \n\nI had chemo the other day and when I got home he came over to check on me. It was just me, him, and my mom home. My mom had an appointment tho so she asked Noah to stay with me in case I needed anything. We went to my room and I took a nap and he sat next to me and watched tv. My mom didn\u2019t tell my dad that Noah was there because it was like 3 and he wasn\u2019t supposed to come home until like 7 and she would\u2019ve been home way before that. For some reason, he came home a half hour after my mom left, saw Noah\u2019s car in the driveway, and went in my room to kick him out and to yell at me for having him here when we\u2019re home alone. Noah tried to tell him that my mom asked him to stay but my dad wasn\u2019t having it. I ended up yelling at my dad that I don\u2019t know what his problem is, mom invited him, and I said mom probably loves Noah so much because he\u2019s nothing like him. \n\nHe left but now he won\u2019t talk to me.

Her meltdown was an awesome thing to behold as the awareness that people have despised her for years sunk in. \n\nShe\u2019s in a bit of self exile right now because I honestly think she doesn\u2019t know how to re-enter polite society and make amends. But life is more peaceful for the majority of family members. \n\nWe simply need to stop enabling assholes. No second chances. No first chances. When they say something vile. Or cruel.

Having a partner like your boyfriend is a true blessing. Your dad has no right in any shape or form to put stress on you at this time, especially not for having someone caring for you.\n\nKeep up the fight and keep yourself surrounded with positive people and thoughts. \n\nOff topic, Doctors thought I wouldn't make it when I was diagnosed at 21, here I am now with a wonderful boy called Noah...

My mom finally left when I was 30. I moved out and set my boundaries with him long before that. But you\u2019re in a rough spot. \n\nWord of advice? When you get into it with him, do it for you and keep your mother out of it. Don\u2019t fight battles for her that she didn\u2019t ask you to fight. \n\nJust stick to why you want Noah there, and tell your parents to communicate with one another not to put you in situations like that. You and your boyfriend don\u2019t need to be collateral damage because they can\u2019t agree on a parenting style.\n\nSounds like you have a great support system in Noah, and there is no doubt that the reason your dad doesn\u2019t like him is because he makes your dad feel shitty that a fucking kid is doing a better job of being a partner *and* a support than he is. To put it bluntly, Noah is making him look bad. And that\u2019s not your problem.\n\nI feel for you. It sucks to feel like you and your partner are the more mature ones when your parents are acting up.", "I would say just in case, that you can be completely justified and right in every way in something, but I don't know how strong his ego is vs the love of his child, and which of those comes first. If he is paying for treatment and has the chance of kicking you out, removing you from insurance, not paying anymore, or you have a chance to lose something like a college fund, if there isn't abuse to the point of a line of severity and danger, it can be good to keep your head down until you are set up and are able to financially support yourself after taking what you can. 18 is a risky risky time to rock the boat too hard if you're relying on them for treatment. Sometimes survival comes first, especially if you have a hell scape of a Healthcare system", "Interesting story.\n\nI wonder if this humbling will teach her to change her ways. That\u2019s what I can hope anyways. Even if it doesn\u2019t happen I still believe nobody is beyond redemption."]}
