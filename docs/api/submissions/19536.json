But unfair as it is, it is their money to do with as they please.\n\nYou may have to look at other options.  For example, community college for the first year or two (hopefully, the community college has a transfer agreement with a four year university).  Or, ROTC.  I know some federal agencies (e.g.,  CIA) have internships programs, but they are mainly for certain STEM majors (if you get selected, you work for them during the summers and they pick up your tuition, and you have a job waiting for you when you graduate).\n\nNTA.  Best of luck to you.  I hope it all works out well for you.", "NTA.  And it is their money.  But your parents clearly let you and your brother down.  To be frank, you don\u2019t retire early by having a second child.  And they clearly didn\u2019t tell you earlier  so that you can plan.  Not sure of your field of study but a few options because this is ALL on you.  Get your parents to agree that you don\u2019t pay rent or provide child care because the options suck up all your time.  Be nice about the childcare, watch him when you can but they want you out so that they can retire.  Good luck!  And talk to your school counselors too.  I\u2019ve done this and a few of my friends did too.  Good luck!\n\n1. Go to a community college for your pre-requisites.  And work full time.\n2. Get your full time job at a large company like a Bank, with a call center.  Flexible hours and tuition reimbursement.  They often recruit from community colleges.\n3. Transfer to a 4 year college and finish up your last 2 years and get your degree still getting tuition reimbursements and grants.  Dude, apply to everything!  You may have a bit of debt but not monster.", "I\u2019d say NTA\nIf they started your college fund when you were a baby then they have the same amount of time to do it for him. If they don\u2019t want to keep putting money away for another 18 years they should have thought about that before having another kid", "NTA\n\nIt's a real asshole move on their part to suddenly take away the funding they had promised you all along. You made plans based on this promise.\n\nTell them you've found a solution and you plan to open an onlyffans to fund your college. It might get them to reconsider.", "NTA - but sadly your parents are right in this it's their money. They get to do what they want with it. That's the truth.   \n\nAnd saying you should save more is such a BS older person thing. College is expensive and COL is easily triple to quadruple what your parents paid.    \n\nThe reality is you will probably have to take some loans. Apply for scholarships and keep applying while in school. My brother landed a full scholarship for his last year of school. I was able to graduate early by taking a few extra classes and save a fair amount.  \n\nBut it is also a okay to be sad and hurt by this. Your parents did not set this up well. Even if they split it 60/40 - it will grow in 16 years.  \n\nI would ask them if you can split it 70/30 which will allow more to grow. And promise that if you have a really good paying job, you'll contribute some to brother. Trade less debt now for a maybe in the future. Just spitballing", "NTA\n\nYour parents have the right to split any college fund that they own.  But their plan to split the money 50/50 doesn't make sense.  If they invest your brother's \"share\"of the fund, the money could quadruple by the time he gets to college.  So, if they take half the fund now and invest it for him, your brother could receive four times more support for college than you.\n\nIf your parents are set on splitting the account, it wouldn't be unreasonable for you to ask for a more fair split.  Maybe 2/3 for your college and 1/3 invested for your brother.\n\nMake sure to look into in-state public schools and the scholarships they offer.", "NTA but also nothing you can do about the situation. Just have to accept it and figure it out.", "NTA. Your parents certainly have every right to do what they want with their money, but you\u2019re not a bad person for being upset about the situation. \n\nJust because someone has a right to do something doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t an AH when they do.\n\nHad you known 2+ years ago when your parents got pregnant that you\u2019d be giving up half your college fund you could have made different choices. Your mind may have been on different schools, factoring in student aid/loans, spending less, working more hours to build more savings etc. Instead, they pulled the rug out at the last minute. They have the right to do it, but it\u2019s still a dick move. \n\nAnd\u2026let\u2019s all be honest with ourselves here. It sounds like OP\u2019s parents are financially comfortable. If they\u2019re in a position to have savings to retire early enough to spend time with a new child at 40 yo, then realistically, working an extra 6-12 months would probably equal well more than half that college fund\u2014if they even really need to. \n\nWhat\u2019s the difference? They (or one of them)retire at 51 instead of 50, sock away enough for both kids to afford school. If you\u2019re going to provide for one kid, you provide for both. You don\u2019t take from one to pay for the other just because you can.", "NTA,  these people have been telling their child that they're gonna have their financial needs met for college their entire life, and then instead they replace them with another child as a retirement project that will ultimately make their promise to you impossible. It's not that you're entitled to it, it's that you've been told your entire life that it was there for you, and now it isn't, and your parents did that. They can't act like you aren't allowed to have feelings about funds being literally yanked from you due to their selfishness.", "INFO do you have grandparents? Can they help?\n\nEdit: if you don\u2019t have any other resources, consider the future with student debt. It\u2019s not the end of the world. Don\u2019t stay at home unless that was your plan.\n\nAlso, as others said, consider a community college for the 1st 2 years.  Also, think about working for a non profit in order to help defray loan costs .\n\nTry not to be bitter or angry. I think it\u2019s super wrong of your parents to do this, but you can only control your actions. Don\u2019t let them get you down.", "NTA.  While it is true that it is the parents' money, that doesn't mean they're not being AHs to OP.  They're sending OP up a creek so they can have a party baby.  Hopefully OP will be sufficiently independent of them when that situation inevitably comes crashing down.", "NTA. This isn't about your brother. This is about them not wanting to work anymore so they're forcing you to make sacrifices since they're too selfish to do so. When you finish college and make more money, feel free to slam the door in their faces when they come to you with their hands out. And they most likely will; that college fund will run out quickly and they'll probably expect you to help fund their retirement and pay for your brother's education. Say NO.", "NTA as far as your post title goes, and their desire to retire early to spend more time with your brother must really hurt, but they've made up their minds and you have to deal with that. Half is better than nothing.", "NTA. They do have plenty of time to save up for him.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But you can not force them to keep their empty promisses.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo take what you get, and know you can never trust them. See them a lot less once you are trhough college - and: When they are old an need something, point at your brother to take care of them.", "NTA. It isn't fair. But your parents have a point that it's their money. They could have told you sooner, before you bought the switch.", "NTA, but unfortunately, your parents are right, it's not your money, not until they actually give it to you. Parents are generally under no obligation to fund your college plans, as I found out the hard way after they got divorced. I had to fight to get money for text books, and I paid all my tuition and fees with grants and loans in my name only. It sucks, but hopefully you can figure out how to budget and pay for school on your own.", "NTA: Your parents are being short sighted and illogical, but it is their money so they can choose what they want to do with it.", "NTA. Yes, it's their money, and yes, they can do what they want with it, but the caveat to this is that you can determine your own feelings and response to their choice. \n\nMy reading on this is that they are favoring your brother and early retirement over you. Knowing where you are on their list of priorities can and probably should impact where THEY are on YOUR list of priorities.\n\nThis isn't to say go NC with them (this sub tends to jump to that very quickly), but realistically, it means don't overburden yourself on their behalf when they want babysitting help, etc, once you're an independent adult.\n\nAlso you sound super responsible with your expense spreadsheets, so kudos.", "You're NTA for wanting the money, but in the end, it's their money to do what they want with it. They're still aiding in the College fund, but they are now using it to think of the future for your brother aswell.", "NTA but I doubt they change their minds", "Yeah, that's the parents money, they can do what they want with them, blah-blah-blah.\n\nThe question here is: why what they want is to deprive their first child of education they have raised her to have? If I were the child, I would like to know the answer very much.\n\nNTA, OP. Start getting used to the thought that you don't have parents anymore and won't have any support. Don't put much faith in their promises to help you with other costs, half year in it'll turn out these money are theirs too and your brother needs them more. Take whatever you be able to and get away, or they'll ask back for it because brother. They have shown their hand, run before they start playing it in full. Half of the college fund is just the beginning.", "I\u2019m kinda laughing at them being judgmental about the Switch purchase. Oh, please, college is literally thousands of dollars and a Switch is less than $400. \n\nNTA, your parents lead you to believe that you\u2019d have access to the full fund and then pulled the rug out for under you at the last minute. Yes, it is their money, but that doesn\u2019t make them not an AH.", "Nta take the half and stop speaking to them:)", "Nta \nBut if they want it this way I would also day to them that it will come back when they retire \nWhen they prefer their younger child i would push the problems when they get old also to the younger one", "NTA. I wonder how they would like it if it came to bite them in the back in like a decade.\n\n\"Sorry, Mom and Dad. I know I promised full in-house care, but I decided to invest in a passion project of mine so I guess you're staying at a nursing home. Sorry, I just want to save up for my early retirement.\"", "There are tons of scholarships/programs out there. Look into Questbridge, Coca-Cola Scholars, Pepsi Community Scholarship, The Gates Scholarship, Dell Scholars Program, Jack Kent Cooke Foundation College Scholarship Program, Taco Bell Scholarship. There are so many more scholarships that you can apply for based on categories such as: merit-based, needs-based, scholarship competitions, specialty awards! Re do your spreadsheets. Create one for schools you are applying to/internal scholarships to and then another spreadsheet for external scholarships. Include the due dates on all of them. Start drafting recommendation emails to teachers, community leaders, your manager, etc. (Forgot to add- depending on which state you reside in, if you have a certain GPA/test score range you qualified for further subsidized/free education. Search your states website and include free education/education discount). \n\nLook into out of state schools as well based on your CGPA and SAT/ACT score. Do not turn down the money at all. You were told full before but now it is half and you can still make up the other have or close to it with proper planning. Definitely look into going away for school if you can and doing room and board. \n\nIt is their money so they can do whatever they want with it albeit they should have told you well in advance. Do not take on the babysitting or any responsibilities surrounding this child. They can deal with it all. I do think it\u2019s absurd to have another child, want to retire early to raise it, and not think about the finances that come into play outside of post secondary education for a baby who has 18 years until college. Your parents aren\u2019t being very realistic and will set themselves and your younger brother up for failure. BUT focus on yourself. Please PM me if you have additional questions or want more scholarship names/how to go about things. This situation should give you the fuel you need to be resilient and determined!", "NTA, but ultimately your parents are in control of how they spend their money. Remember their decision as you make future choices. Because you have to work harder to pay for college, you literally can't afford to feel guilty if you:\n*Rarely visit your parents because you are working\n*Have limited time to keep in touch with them because you are working, at school, or need that free time to recharge\n*Skip family events due to your busy schedule\n*Move far away because that job is the best choice financially\n\nI'm not suggesting you cut off your family over money, but the fact is there will be natural consequences if you are juggling more loans. When they do finance their child's college education, parents are sort of buying their kid more childhood, more time to be free of big responsibilities. Not all parents can or want to do this. Those kids just have to jump into full adulthood immediately. So, don't ever let them make you feel bad if they ask you something and you need to say, \"I can't. I need to work.\" \"I can't. That's not in my budget right now.\" You're not a child who can easily pop over for birthdays or holidays. You're an adult, responsible for your own success.", "NTA. Your parents are awful, though. Early retirement is not compatible with a late-in-life baby, and they are trying to force it to work by putting the financial strain on you.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if they always wanted a boy and now that they have one, they feel fine taking from their less-desirable girl.\n\nIt is their money, sadly, and they are absolutely within their legal rights to screw you over.", "I think this is a pretty common issue. A lot of people that I know have to pay for their entire college. Would you be able to get any financial aid?

If they save half the money, then with interest or market returns, the actual money he\u2019ll have will be much higher than you.

On the other hand, it is your parents money and they have every right to allocate however they want. So they\u2019re NTA either IMO. It is what it is. Either you settle for a cheaper school or you take out student loans for the difference.

It worked pretty much perfectly, I even got a nice bonus as my brothers grew more than expected so they gave me the same amount to keep it fair.", "Can't upvote this enough. OP's parents are the ones who decided to have another kid, knowing when they wanted to retire and what their original plan was. Taking away from what they told OP would be OP's resource for college is not the right avenue here.", "People who choose to reproduce regularly try to make that other peoples problem. NTA OP, your parents are fucking you over and acting like it\u2019s normal. I would never let them live it down", "That\u2019s a good point.", "I have a feeling they might even do that! NTA, can't even understand such logic from parents. You choose to have the damn kid!!", "Or that you'll just pay off any loans with the funds you were anticipating for parental support or any contributuons for your brother's  future gifts and care they have unilaterally and without your consent decided that funds that were earmarked for you are for familial contributions.\n\nSeriously though, OP, while it is probably (ianal and I don't know your jurisdictions) on paper fine for your parents to do this, this is both upsetting in and pretty cruel, both to blindside you like this then criticize you for planning out your decisions better than it sounds like they have. Not to mention that I've no doubt other aspects of your life have changed since the baby arrived, something you have no control over. They have the right to their reproductive planning, but that doesn't exempt them from their responsibility to you as their child or the promises they made you. You're allowed to be furious, hurt, and so many other things, along with feeling betrayed, but short of their changing their mind, I would take action as if familial contribution is unfortunately a lot lower than you planned. That is to say, if they've been planning to cut yours in half, what is stopping them from an 'emergency' with your brother that also dips in? I'd be applying for scholarships and if at all possible, beginning to limit what info you give on your paychecks- you may need the money.", ">You made plans based on this promise.\n\nThis. It sucks. NTA.\n\nBut yes, it's their money. If they don't cave when you announce your OF plan, you will have to adapt.", "> Tell them you've found a solution and you plan to open an onlyffans to fund your college. \n\nsavage", "70/30 split is most reasonable, but OP should NOT make promises on her future earnings. Not her responsibility. And they'll hold her to it and bad mouth her to son later on if she doesn't comply. \nIf she chooses later she can give the child good monetary gifts for graduations, and that child can save it just like she's had to.", "It actually depends on how it is set up. They may not have the right to do it.", "I like this- since the parents are acting as if it's a foregone conclusion, meet them there and try to negotiate if this is the kind of college fund they fully control. But I would also recommend OP look at this carefully as one example of how her parents keep their word.", "They choose to have another child knowing they where wanting to retire early that\u2019s on them. You should not have to be forced to pay for thier poor planning and decisions!", "Do you think part of their reasoning is because he is a male?", "They said they'll still cover my living expenses if I continue to live at home if I want to commute. \n\nWe haven't done FAFSA yet so I don't know what my EFC is yet so I can't accurately predict what my financial aid will be yet but at every school it looks like I'll still qualify for subsidized and unsubsidized loans. No grants though.", "This. Because brother's share will grow with compound interest", "If the parents wanted to retire why is it fair to op to split her money. They are the ones who decided to have another child. She didn\u2019t. They wanted to retire may not have another child and force the other to pay the price for their decision", "That doesn\u2019t foster willingness to be better, I understand your reasoning about them being equal when they graduate, but if one kid gets more scholarship money, why isn\u2019t that like a prize they won? My parents died before I went to college, but their idea was to give each kid the same amount (enough for all the costs) and if you got a full ride, the money was yours once you graduated.", "Good luck. Even many state schools now are 20-30k in state tuition per term (not including dorms). And if she lives at home she is gonna have to likely baby sit and get distracted by screaming baby. Better to take a loan and end up in a dorm or apartment than deal with that for four years.", "Maybe it was an edit since you commented, but the ages are in the post.", "\u201cRising\u201d just means they have completed their prior year of school, but haven\u2019t started the next year yet. So technically she\u2019s not a junior anymore because the school year is finished, but she hasn\u2019t started her senior year yet.", "If she wants half that college fund then she can\u2019t really unless they transfer her 1/2 of the fund", "But parents shouldn\u2019t be forced to pay for college tuition either. Its a privilege, not a right. It\u2019s unfortunate for OP for sure. Her parents have every right to have a second child, this isn\u2019t something that needs to be agreed upon with OP first.", "Honestly this isn\u2019t the right approach to this problem. If they were favouring them, then they\u2019d give him more. Here its a 50-50 split, given that by retiring early they wont be able to contribute to his college fund. Its sounds fair on me from a stranger\u2019s pov though it undoubtedly feels unfair to you now. Could you negotiate with your parents to receive the full amount but you promise to repay that amount in due course for your little brother?", "Unfortunately if you live at home with them, they will probably try to make you the full time unpaid babysitter/nanny. \n\nDoing your first two years at a community college will save you a bunch of money. Move out with roommates, and make your second job be applying for as many scholarships as possible. Small scholarships will add up.", "EFC is estimated family contribution.", "Ahh I see. Living at home is not the best option imo. Unless you are going to a community college it is best to live in the dorm and make friends. You could also go the community college rout where you save a ton of money your first 2 years and then transfer. \n\nBut before you make a decision do your FAFSA and see what you can afford. Worst case you can get a part time job in college which is not that bad. A lot of the time you can find a chill job where you pretty much just sit around and you can do homework during your shift. Good luck!", "Move out if you can, or you\u2019re going to end up their full time, unpaid babysitter. And even if you don\u2019t, studying for college with a newborn baby in the house is a recipe for disaster.", "Can you take a year off before college? \n\nMy brother took a year off after high school, got a job, and moved out so he could establish residency on his own. It meant he could file taxes on his own as well as file his FAFSA independent of our parents and so received better government aid.\n\nNot sure though if that is still possible or if it would even be possible for you- you would have to research.\n\nGood luck OP.", "But inflation and college fees will also go up. So it is possible that the static amount in the fund now , with compound interest will only pay a percentage of those fees in the future. There are no guarantees here", "Because its not HER money", "You right my apologies.", "After she gets out of college\u2026I would, but then again I\u2019ve cut off family members for playing favorites", "Sure, parental contribution isn't guaranteed, but this is a case in which it was promised. And I pity the parents who decide promises to their children don't matter, let alone those who say promises to loved ones don't.", "I'd note something another commenter mentioned- 1/2 of a fund over the next 5-7 years v the other 1/2 potentially growing for 15-17 years is decidedly not equal.", "Expected*"]}
