I was an only child before. I was talking to my mom about college and showed her my spreadsheet. Then she told me that I need to adjust it for half of the college savings as they were planning to give my brother half for his college savings. I was pretty shocked by this since they have 16+ years to save up for his college, if that's something he'll even want to do. I ran the numbers with half the savings and it's not looking good. I want to graduate with as little debt as possible and taking away half is pretty damaging to that. \n\nI tried talking to both of my parents about it but they wouldn't budge. My dad said it's their money so it's up to them how they get to spend it and I'm not entitled to it, which I understand. They said they're hoping to retire early so they have more time with my brother. Funding another college fund would push back their retirement.

But unfair as it is, it is their money to do with as they please.\n\nYou may have to look at other options.  For example, community college for the first year or two (hopefully, the community college has a transfer agreement with a four year university).  Or, ROTC.  I know some federal agencies (e.g.,  CIA) have internships programs, but they are mainly for certain STEM majors (if you get selected, you work for them during the summers and they pick up your tuition, and you have a job waiting for you when you graduate).\n\nNTA.  Best of luck to you.  I hope it all works out well for you.", "NTA.  And it is their money.  But your parents clearly let you and your brother down.  To be frank, you don\u2019t retire early by having a second child.  And they clearly didn\u2019t tell you earlier  so that you can plan.  Not sure of your field of study but a few options because this is ALL on you.  Get your parents to agree that you don\u2019t pay rent or provide child care because the options suck up all your time.  Be nice about the childcare, watch him when you can but they want you out so that they can retire.  Good luck!  And talk to your school counselors too.  I\u2019ve done this and a few of my friends did too.  Good luck!\n\n1. Go to a community college for your pre-requisites.  And work full time.\n2. Get your full time job at a large company like a Bank, with a call center.  Flexible hours and tuition reimbursement.  They often recruit from community colleges.\n3. Transfer to a 4 year college and finish up your last 2 years and get your degree still getting tuition reimbursements and grants.  Dude, apply to everything!  You may have a bit of debt but not monster.", "I\u2019d say NTA\nIf they started your college fund when you were a baby then they have the same amount of time to do it for him. If they don\u2019t want to keep putting money away for another 18 years they should have thought about that before having another kid", "NTA\n\nIt's a real asshole move on their part to suddenly take away the funding they had promised you all along. You made plans based on this promise.\n\nTell them you've found a solution and you plan to open an onlyffans to fund your college. It might get them to reconsider.", "NTA - but sadly your parents are right in this it's their money. They get to do what they want with it. That's the truth.   \n\nAnd saying you should save more is such a BS older person thing. College is expensive and COL is easily triple to quadruple what your parents paid.    \n\nThe reality is you will probably have to take some loans. Apply for scholarships and keep applying while in school. My brother landed a full scholarship for his last year of school. I was able to graduate early by taking a few extra classes and save a fair amount.  \n\nBut it is also a okay to be sad and hurt by this. Your parents did not set this up well. Even if they split it 60/40 - it will grow in 16 years.  \n\nI would ask them if you can split it 70/30 which will allow more to grow. And promise that if you have a really good paying job, you'll contribute some to brother. Trade less debt now for a maybe in the future. Just spitballing", "NTA\n\nYour parents have the right to split any college fund that they own.  But their plan to split the money 50/50 doesn't make sense.  If they invest your brother's \"share\"of the fund, the money could quadruple by the time he gets to college.  So, if they take half the fund now and invest it for him, your brother could receive four times more support for college than you.\n\nIf your parents are set on splitting the account, it wouldn't be unreasonable for you to ask for a more fair split.  Maybe 2/3 for your college and 1/3 invested for your brother.\n\nMake sure to look into in-state public schools and the scholarships they offer.", "NTA but also nothing you can do about the situation. Just have to accept it and figure it out.", "NTA. Your parents certainly have every right to do what they want with their money, but you\u2019re not a bad person for being upset about the situation. \n\nJust because someone has a right to do something doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t an AH when they do.\n\nHad you known 2+ years ago when your parents got pregnant that you\u2019d be giving up half your college fund you could have made different choices. Your mind may have been on different schools, factoring in student aid/loans, spending less, working more hours to build more savings etc. Instead, they pulled the rug out at the last minute. They have the right to do it, but it\u2019s still a dick move. \n\nAnd\u2026let\u2019s all be honest with ourselves here. It sounds like OP\u2019s parents are financially comfortable. If they\u2019re in a position to have savings to retire early enough to spend time with a new child at 40 yo, then realistically, working an extra 6-12 months would probably equal well more than half that college fund\u2014if they even really need to. \n\nWhat\u2019s the difference? They (or one of them)retire at 51 instead of 50, sock away enough for both kids to afford school. If you\u2019re going to provide for one kid, you provide for both. You don\u2019t take from one to pay for the other just because you can.", "NTA,  these people have been telling their child that they're gonna have their financial needs met for college their entire life, and then instead they replace them with another child as a retirement project that will ultimately make their promise to you impossible. It's not that you're entitled to it, it's that you've been told your entire life that it was there for you, and now it isn't, and your parents did that. They can't act like you aren't allowed to have feelings about funds being literally yanked from you due to their selfishness.", "INFO do you have grandparents? Can they help?\n\nEdit: if you don\u2019t have any other resources, consider the future with student debt. It\u2019s not the end of the world. Don\u2019t stay at home unless that was your plan.\n\nAlso, as others said, consider a community college for the 1st 2 years.  Also, think about working for a non profit in order to help defray loan costs .\n\nTry not to be bitter or angry. I think it\u2019s super wrong of your parents to do this, but you can only control your actions. Don\u2019t let them get you down.", "NTA.  While it is true that it is the parents' money, that doesn't mean they're not being AHs to OP.  They're sending OP up a creek so they can have a party baby.  Hopefully OP will be sufficiently independent of them when that situation inevitably comes crashing down.", "NTA. This isn't about your brother. This is about them not wanting to work anymore so they're forcing you to make sacrifices since they're too selfish to do so. When you finish college and make more money, feel free to slam the door in their faces when they come to you with their hands out. And they most likely will; that college fund will run out quickly and they'll probably expect you to help fund their retirement and pay for your brother's education. Say NO.", "NTA as far as your post title goes, and their desire to retire early to spend more time with your brother must really hurt, but they've made up their minds and you have to deal with that. Half is better than nothing.", "NTA. They do have plenty of time to save up for him.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**But you can not force them to keep their empty promisses.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo take what you get, and know you can never trust them. See them a lot less once you are trhough college - and: When they are old an need something, point at your brother to take care of them.", "NTA. It isn't fair. But your parents have a point that it's their money. They could have told you sooner, before you bought the switch.", "NTA, but unfortunately, your parents are right, it's not your money, not until they actually give it to you. Parents are generally under no obligation to fund your college plans, as I found out the hard way after they got divorced. I had to fight to get money for text books, and I paid all my tuition and fees with grants and loans in my name only. It sucks, but hopefully you can figure out how to budget and pay for school on your own.", "NTA: Your parents are being short sighted and illogical, but it is their money so they can choose what they want to do with it.", "NTA. Yes, it's their money, and yes, they can do what they want with it, but the caveat to this is that you can determine your own feelings and response to their choice. \n\nMy reading on this is that they are favoring your brother and early retirement over you. Knowing where you are on their list of priorities can and probably should impact where THEY are on YOUR list of priorities.\n\nThis isn't to say go NC with them (this sub tends to jump to that very quickly), but realistically, it means don't overburden yourself on their behalf when they want babysitting help, etc, once you're an independent adult.\n\nAlso you sound super responsible with your expense spreadsheets, so kudos.", "You're NTA for wanting the money, but in the end, it's their money to do what they want with it. They're still aiding in the College fund, but they are now using it to think of the future for your brother aswell.", "NTA but I doubt they change their minds", "Yeah, that's the parents money, they can do what they want with them, blah-blah-blah.\n\nThe question here is: why what they want is to deprive their first child of education they have raised her to have? If I were the child, I would like to know the answer very much.\n\nNTA, OP. Start getting used to the thought that you don't have parents anymore and won't have any support. Don't put much faith in their promises to help you with other costs, half year in it'll turn out these money are theirs too and your brother needs them more. Take whatever you be able to and get away, or they'll ask back for it because brother. They have shown their hand, run before they start playing it in full. Half of the college fund is just the beginning.", "I\u2019m kinda laughing at them being judgmental about the Switch purchase. Oh, please, college is literally thousands of dollars and a Switch is less than $400. \n\nNTA, your parents lead you to believe that you\u2019d have access to the full fund and then pulled the rug out for under you at the last minute. Yes, it is their money, but that doesn\u2019t make them not an AH.", "Nta take the half and stop speaking to them:)", "Nta \nBut if they want it this way I would also day to them that it will come back when they retire \nWhen they prefer their younger child i would push the problems when they get old also to the younger one", "NTA. I wonder how they would like it if it came to bite them in the back in like a decade.\n\n\"Sorry, Mom and Dad. I know I promised full in-house care, but I decided to invest in a passion project of mine so I guess you're staying at a nursing home. Sorry, I just want to save up for my early retirement.\"", "There are tons of scholarships/programs out there. Look into Questbridge, Coca-Cola Scholars, Pepsi Community Scholarship, The Gates Scholarship, Dell Scholars Program, Jack Kent Cooke Foundation College Scholarship Program, Taco Bell Scholarship. There are so many more scholarships that you can apply for based on categories such as: merit-based, needs-based, scholarship competitions, specialty awards! Re do your spreadsheets. Create one for schools you are applying to/internal scholarships to and then another spreadsheet for external scholarships. Include the due dates on all of them. Start drafting recommendation emails to teachers, community leaders, your manager, etc. (Forgot to add- depending on which state you reside in, if you have a certain GPA/test score range you qualified for further subsidized/free education. Search your states website and include free education/education discount). \n\nLook into out of state schools as well based on your CGPA and SAT/ACT score. Per example- Air Force, West Point, Naval Academy (free education, you get paid while going to school, serve a few years 4-8 I believe). Do not turn down the money at all. You were told full before but now it is half and you can still make up the other have or close to it with proper planning. Definitely look into going away for school if you can and doing room and board. \n\nIt is their money so they can do whatever they want with it albeit they should have told you well in advance. Do not take on the babysitting or any responsibilities surrounding this child. They can deal with it all. I do think it\u2019s absurd to have another child, want to retire early to raise it, and not think about the finances that come into play outside of post secondary education for a baby who has 18 years until college. Your parents aren\u2019t being very realistic and will set themselves and your younger brother up for failure. BUT focus on yourself. Please PM me if you have additional questions or want more scholarship names/how to go about things. This situation should give you the fuel you need to be resilient and determined!", "NTA, but ultimately your parents are in control of how they spend their money. Remember their decision as you make future choices. Because you have to work harder to pay for college, you literally can't afford to feel guilty if you:\n*Rarely visit your parents because you are working\n*Have limited time to keep in touch with them because you are working, at school, or need that free time to recharge\n*Skip family events due to your busy schedule\n*Move far away because that job is the best choice financially\n\nI'm not suggesting you cut off your family over money, but the fact is there will be natural consequences if you are juggling more loans. When they do finance their child's college education, parents are sort of buying their kid more childhood, more time to be free of big responsibilities. Not all parents can or want to do this. Those kids just have to jump into full adulthood immediately. So, don't ever let them make you feel bad if they ask you something and you need to say, \"I can't. I need to work.\" \"I can't. That's not in my budget right now.\" You're not a child who can easily pop over for birthdays or holidays. You're an adult, responsible for your own success.", "NTA. Your parents are awful, though. Early retirement is not compatible with a late-in-life baby, and they are trying to force it to work by putting the financial strain on you.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if they always wanted a boy and now that they have one, they feel fine taking from their less-desirable girl.\n\nIt is their money, sadly, and they are absolutely within their legal rights to screw you over.", "I think this is a pretty common issue. A lot of people that I know have to pay for their entire college. Would you be able to get any financial aid? Also maybe you could discuss with them about paying for your living expenses (rent and food). But it is hard to assume that your parents will pay for the majority of your college when it is so expensive.", "NTA, you\u2019re right that it doesn\u2019t seem fair.\n\nAs a compromise, could you do a rate of return calculation on the money? If they save half the money, then with interest or market returns, the actual money he\u2019ll have will be much higher than you. Maybe you can argue that if they don\u2019t invest anymore money after you\u2019re 18, if they have you 2/3 the savings, he\u2019d still end up with more than you?", "NTA. \nIs this money just in an account they say they have OR did they put the money into a 529 account for you? If it\u2019s a 529, they can\u2019t split the account, if it\u2019s just a regular account, you are stuck in the \u201cit\u2019s their money\u201d situation.", "NAH. Everyone is correct but this will teach you something valuable that will extend in life that wont be taught in a classroom. Life throws you curve balls that you can\u2019t change.

It may not go as planned but you now, but you can find a way.", "NAH\n\nRealistically your parents are right since it is their money like it wouldn\u2019t be fair to them or your brother to just put the entire college fund to you or to push their own retirement.

Would you qualify for student aid based on your family\u2019s income?", "NTA but they have every right to decide how much they are willing to contribute to your college. There are 2 of you now. \n\nWe always made it clear that the college funds was still our money and we shuffled them as needed but none of our kids had student loans by the time they finished. But they did not get equal amounts and they didn\u2019t get leftover money even they had more scholarships than one of their siblings. It was not a gift to them, we just tried to give them all a clean slate without loans after college and we did that.", "NAH - I totally get your point of view and why you would be upset so you\u2019re definitely NTA for feeling what you feel. On the other hand, it is your parents money and they have every right to allocate however they want. So they\u2019re NTA either IMO. It is what it is. Either you settle for a cheaper school or you take out student loans for the difference. I wouldn\u2019t recommend loans (I\u2019m still paying mine back 10 years after graduating)\u2026unless you\u2019re majoring in something that will get you 10x the return like in STEM.", "YTA.

No. And you are NTA for understanding that it\u2019s favoring your baby brother. Do your parents not understand how compound interest works?\n\nIt\u2019s their money, so they can do with it what they want. I\u2019m not sure how open they are to negotiating, but if they\u2019re looking to be fair, the math says they should split the college fund unevenly. (Still sucks for you, but sucks less.)\n\nFor example, if we assume a $100k college fund at a 4% APY, and also assume they will deposit $100/month into it for your brother until he starts college, and they will give each of you a $100/month \u201callowance\u201d during the 4 years of college (in lieu of adding to the fund once college starts)\u2026 a 50-50 split would result in them providing ~$55k for your education and ~$133k for his. BUT, if they put ~24% aside for him and give you ~76% of the fund, you each would have ~$80k for your respective educations.\n\nThat said, be prepared to for them to reject that suggestion. Many people don\u2019t really understand how compounding interest works. I would personally recommend you operate under the assumption they won\u2019t help you with any of your schooling. Why? Because they shown themselves to be unreliable and you don\u2019t want to be in a position halfway through college where suddenly they cut you off from what remains of your half.\n\nSo, I would recommend, if possible, using your college fund for the first year or two and then using a combination of _your_ savings (you said you had savings of your own) and loans for the remaining years. You could sell it as \u201cI will have to take out loans, but I don\u2019t want to until necessary so I can save on interest\u201d. You might also qualify for grants that way\u2026 back when I was in college at least, my university made every effort to find random grants for students who had a change in financial circumstances partway through their education.\n\nIf your parents don\u2019t go for that, well\u2026 just make sure you have planned for funding your education as if they won\u2019t contribute at all.

Community college will be way cheaper. But You do lose out on the freshman moving away to college experience.

When your parents confront you for \"making them look bad\", hand them a list of every single family member and family friend you can think of, bonus points if they're people they make an extra effort to look good in front of like religious or work friends on the list. Tell them they've left you no choice. Have the people you called checked off, but make sure they're only half the list so they see that you're just getting started, even if you don't actually plan on calling those people.

If you can get the Pell, many universities offer scholarships to go with it and really boost that amount up. What aid does each school offer based on need and academics? Some schools hand out scholarships based on ACT scores, others looks at GPA (Kansas gives out so much money based on grades, I was astonished! And one MO school will cover full tuition for an ACT of 24 or higher), and some tiny schools have huge endowments, so they give away more than you would expect. I was freaking out about my kid's college and talked to financial aid many times. They really came through- between a Pell, a generous grant through the university to support Pell students and other under-represented groups, federal work study, and small federal loans, we got a 40k bill down to 15k, which we have in a 529 controlled by grandparents.
