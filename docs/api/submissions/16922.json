It sounds like the rest of your family is also enabling his bad behavior.", "NTA but if he was that comfortable to act like this in front of you, I guarantee your grandmother is babying him and enabling this behavior.

I have relatives like him and their behavior is also enabled by other family members. However, it sounds like this is the system your grandmother created with her kids\u2014whether or not it\u2019s actually fair or good or they use it in a selfish way. Ultimately, you are not going to convince him or anyone else to change their behavior patterns. \n\nA lot of resentment that can build up from watching your uncle\u2019s jerky behavior going unchecked. Anger is a normal reaction to what he\u2019s doing. But yelling at him isn\u2019t going to change him. What I hope you learn is we can only control ourselves. Build a good support system (and maybe it should be outside of your family) and get some space from your family.", "NTA. Your uncle is literally incapable to make something to eat? Ok i get it cooking can be hard but bro even kids know how to make themselves a sandwich, also expecting and demanding his poor old 73 yr old mom to cook for him is all levels of f*cked up and disrispectful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
