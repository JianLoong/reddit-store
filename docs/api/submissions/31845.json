He got mad and said I shouldn't keep his grand baby away from him and that the past is the past so I should get over it.

He made his choice and now he's living with the consequences. You and your mum gave him plenty of opportunities to be welcomed back into your life, and he pissed on that.\nSo he has absolutely zero claim to be in his grandchild's life when he couldn't be bothered to be in yours.", "NTA\n\nIf he was inconsistent/absent as a father, he will be the same as a grandfather.

He had so many chances. You even contacted him as a 16 year old vulnerable kid, asking for a relationship and he literally said \"no.\". You don't owe him anything!   \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. No way, no how. You are in no way shape or form an AH.\n\nHow can he be a Gpa when he was never a father? Being a father is about more than biology.\n\nGood luck with your pregnancy. Stand firm.", "Absolutely NTA, if he couldn't be bothered to be with you as you grew, so therefore he's not a father figure. You are not the asshole for setting him straight, he's an entitled jerk.", "NTA - I have a similar story with my deadbeat. Although I don\u2019t have kids, he decided to contact me as an adult and was surprised I wasn\u2019t interested. Definitely do not give him the time of day, he\u2019s only interested in the grandparent role.", "NTA. To be a grandfather, you first have to have been a father.", "NTA", ">My bio dad told me he had a 'new' family now and didn't need nor want me. \n\nHow the tables have turned. \n\nYou have a new family now, and you don't need or want him. Since he literally used those exact words to you when you were a vulnerable teenager you should have absolutely no regrets about throwing them back at him now if that's what you want to do. It doesn't sound like your mum thinks you owe him anything or that you would be an AH for sending him away, she just wants you to be sure that it's what you really want.", "NTA. He's a total stranger to you, why on earth would you let him in? The only things you know about him are negative. He abandoned your mum (and you). He refused contact when you were 16. No, do not let him in, he's at the very least unreliable and will disappear again, at worst he's suspect. (Does he need money, or a kidney?) Tell him that your Mummy taught you not to speak to strangers... I'm a bit concerned why your Mum wants you to let him back in, frankly she's bonkers.", "NTA. Seriously, not at all. I understand your mom wants to play peacemaker, but your feelings and experiences are valid. You have no obligation to let him be ANY part if your life. You can't jerk 'family' members along like that. I'd go NC, but of course it's your decision, OP. \n\nYour dad doesn't get to escape accountability by saying 'it's in the past'. Lots of crimes were in the past too and we don't just let those things go, ya know? \n\nCongrats on your baby!", "NTA! You don\u2019t get to leave then decide to return when it is convenient for you. It could be harmful mentally and emotionally to you. It also puts your child at risk to have the hurt you felt growing up if he decides to leave, not only that but open wounds for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

TBH he's probably not going to be a great \"dad\" if he gets mad when you essentially tell him he hurt you a lot by not showing up for you in the past.", "NTA - I do not know you but I would say trust your own instincts. I disagree with your mother given that this \"father\" has been absent and further outright refused  for 25 years to be anything more than an anonymous sperm donor in his refusal to acknowledge you. Being present all of a sudden would not make him onto the/a father you so long desired and perhaps could have benefited from as a child or even as the teenager who had approached him. Not to be disrespectful,  but it sounds as though his entrance onto your life now is solely for selfish motivations, with nothing to do with any love for you as a parent.\n\nI would say prioritize yourself and your own mental wellness at this time. Self-care and focusing on your own self confidence and relationship with your partner, trusting your initial inclinations. Use your therapy sessions and your energy on yourself and your baby. Perhaps later you will decide you would like to try to include or accept this man into your family, but my feeling is that should that time ever come it is better that it be on your terms and choice of timing. You don't need the added stress or disappointment at this point in time.\n\nGood luck. I hope you feel stronger/more confident soon. And congratulations on your baby!", "NTA.

Gaining a father at 25 is not a thing. You can\u2019t just state you\u2019re a father and then magically become one. He is a stranger to you, but worse.

Do not give him a further second of  thought.\n\nBecoming a mom is one of the most difficult transitions a woman goes through and you certainly don\u2019t need this black cloud over your head.

Glad to hear you\u2019re going to therapy, I\u2019m sorry you had a non-existant father. Dealing with parental programming is tough, but we all have it. if he came back with apologies,  it might be different. But he came back with \u201cthe past is the past\u201d garbage. You\u2019re def NTA. But what do YOU want? do you want him to be a part  of your kids life?", "NTA he chose to walk away from you and chose his other family.

Congratulations on the pregnancy.", "NTA - just tell him the past is in the past but you dont feel safe with an absolute stranger around your kid. besides, he will disappear again once his \"actual\" children have their own kids", "NTA. He had his chance, and him deciding that your baby has bad vibes or whatever other sort of nonsense could make him vanish again and that would not only be harmful to you but to your child."]}
