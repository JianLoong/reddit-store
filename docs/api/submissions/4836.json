I have a friend who\u2019s about to give birth any day now and our birthdays are ten days apart. I was hesitant to invite her in the first place since she\u2019s about to give birth but another friend let slip about my party so she basically asked if she could come along too. I said sure and then she said she would have to bring baby girl along.\n\nNow on this trip, I was hoping to cross a bucket list item off my list - taking edibles and going to an aquarium while in Chicago. Finishing the night off with KBBQ and drinking. An environment I wasn\u2019t comfortable having a baby around. My friend doesn\u2019t see the problem with bringing her two month old along at all.\n\nEveryone agrees with me. The baby shouldn\u2019t come with. My friend says that since I don\u2019t have kids, I shouldn\u2019t have a say in how she raises her baby. \n\nAITA?\n\nedit: this will be her third child, my apologies- i should have mentioned above. i\u2019ve never written a reddit post before :/", "created_utc": 1671160115, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zn4hdz/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_cant_bring_her/", "score": 5387, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend needs to grow up to the reality that when she has a child, she has to be an adult and a parent that means a change in her social activities.  She invited herself along on this outing; it's not a kiddy party so she probably better rethink that.", "You shouldn\u2019t have a say in how she raises her baby\u2026*BUT* you definitely have a say in what you planned for your bday weekend!!

Not to mention making poor choices as a new Mom.", "Don't tell her how to raise her kid. Fair enough. She can't tell you who to invite/allow on your trip.", "NTA I'm a parent and I agree that a baby would ruin this whole thing. A trippy girls weekend is no place for a (first-time??) mom and newborn!?! I feel for your friend but c'mon!", "NTA She\u2019s right you don\u2019t have a say in how she raised her child, BUT you have the right to decide who attends your birthday party!", "NTA it\u2019s totally OK to have an event where kids are not invited. It has nothing to do with a judgment on her parenting.  Who wants to deal with a crying baby on your edibles trip?", "NTA. There is a line to be drawn when trying to tell someone what to do with their baby, but this is not that situation. A two month old, still within newborn stage has zero business going here and there, in a large city, on a birthday weekend, in cold ass February, in public spaces, with diseases still swimming in the air. WHILE y\u2019all plan on being drunk and high. Your birthday weekend deserves to be free of children as well as responsibility towards people with children. \n\n**TL;DR: She\u2019s bugging bro**", "NTA, your reasoning is 100% correct. Maybe yall can do a dinner hangout or something to celebrate with her separately from this trip.", "NTA, does she think her baby is a purse?", "Info:\n\nDid you tell this perspective parent what the activities would consist of and that you wouldn\u2019t be modifying them to accommodate her?", "I have little kids and absolutely NTA. Having a baby or small children in a trip completely changes the vibe of the trip. You\u2019re allowed to want a fun, adults only weekend! \n\nWhen you choose to have kids, you need to understand that you\u2019re going to make sacrifices with your social life, especially in the beginning.

She has no idea what she's in for if she expects to make this trip, or even expects to make this kind of trip work with a newborn. \n\nYour right, it will ruin your trip and make it about her and that is very selfish of her to be this stubborn.", "NTA\n\nYour trip, your party, your rules.\n\nIf she's going tag along and bring an infant, the entire tone of the weekend will change.  If that's going to happen, you may as well cancel everything.\n\nTell her to stay home or let grandma keep the baby.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA. It's your birthday, and even if your friend is comfortable with having her daughter in that situation, you aren't. If she were to bring her daughter, you would feel guilt for something that you've had on your bucket list for a while.\n\nI'd say you need to have a conversation with your friend, and make it clear to her that you aren't judging her parenting, just that you want to be able to enjoy your birthday in the way you want without feeling uncomfortable that there is a child present. \n\nIt's also probably a good idea to ask *why* she is so adamant about bringing her child along. Is she having issues finding or affording childcare? It wouldn't change the verdict of NTA, but you may be able to have a more constructive conversation with your friend if you understand the reasons behind the issue. Being a new mom is really hard, and sometimes being without your child for a few days is a lot harder than it may seem, both logistically and emotionally.\n\nEdit to add: I misread, the event is far enough away that the childcare issue is probably not the issue. Still, a conversation is in order", "NTA \n\nEnjoy your birthday, sounds like a fun trip! Definitely not a place for a baby though. It\u2019s your birthday, you get to choose who comes. Why would anyone think this trip is one a baby should go on?", "Nta \n\nYour not telling her how to raise her child you just simply don't want her child at your birthday celebration", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to tell her \u201cI really wish you could come! But this isn\u2019t a child friendly event. The activities planned are not safe for a baby and I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable putting any of us in that situation. I am happy to make separate plans that are baby friendly on another day with you though.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like she has wishful thinking if the baby isn\u2019t born yet. She may not fully understand what bringing the baby will entail in reality.", "NTA. \n\nThat trip is not appropriate for a 2 month year old. You are going to get intoxicated and hit the town. You don\u2019t take a baby for that. \n\nAnd any time someone goes, you don\u2019t have kids you don\u2019t have a voice in how I raise mine, that\u2019s guaranteed they are doing bad parenting behavior and are looking for an excuse to shut down complaints", "Oh my.  You have a baby.....in a bar.  Hmmm.", "There is a reason relationships with single friends change when someone has a child.  NTA.", "NTA. Some people with kids don\u2019t understand they\u2019re not invited everywhere.", "NTA it\u2019s just ridiculous to bring a baby to a grown person\u2018s birthday weekend where they\u2019re going to do drugs and drink. Now you\u2019ve got time delays because you have to pack a car seat ( if you\u2019re driving) ,diaper bag full of her supplies and a stroller.  You know someone is going to end up having to assist her with her infant at some point. It\u2019s best she not go honestly tell her it\u2019s a child free weekend.", "NTA. \n\nI'm surprised that she'd be in the mood emotionally and physically to travel for a birthday weekend with a two month old. My first thought was - this must be the first kid so she has no idea what she's getting into... but THIRD kid and she's considering it?!\n\nMy guess is that she's kinda bummed that she can't join \"normal\" 25yr old activities cause she's a mom and she wants to try to do it all. Two month olds don't even sleep through the night... Who does she plan on bunkering with? How are you guys getting there? Will she be trying to carry her suitcase + baby's + stroller etc? Would be baby's immune system be alright to travel and be exposed to so many environments? It isn't really fun to try to bring everything you need for a baby to different locations and moving around. Does she really think she's going to have any fun? (not even considering how the activities planed are not at all baby compatible...)\n\nI'd try to have an empathic sit down with her and understand why she'd want to put herself through that... If she's feeling left out, you guys can offer to do a dinner back home and celebrate again some other time. She can get proper childcare for the occasion and even \"let loose a little\"/ get some time with her friends.", "NTA- As someone who use to enjoy doing stuff like this before my son. You have to be responsible when you have a kid and that means not being able to do things you use to. You didn\u2019t invent and tell her to ditch her kid. She found out and you invested her to be nice.", "NTA at all. I get that your friend doesn't want to be left out of things, but having a baby will significantly change the dynamic of any gathering, especially one that is 2 months old. The baby will still be crying at all times of the day and night and needing to be fed and nap every few hours, so your friend will likely not be able to participate in a lot of things. It's not really far to you and the rest of the group to have to put up with a crying baby or being quiet around the baby when it naps or needs to feed.", "NTA, but does your friend know what your plans are? Does she know about the edibles, late night drinking, and whatever other shenanigans you plan to get up to? \n\nHaving a baby that young will likely be taxing on her to keep up. She has no idea what new demands her baby will make on her sleep and energy levels. Personally, I would be hesitant to make such a big plan right after having a baby just because I don't know how I'll be functioning then.", "NTA: There is nothing wrong with wanting a child free celebration. It doesn't matter what the reason is. You've asked for a child free celebration and your friends should honor that or not attend if they cannot make arrangements for their children. That is what happens when you choose to have children sometimes.", "NTA, \n\nPeople need to understand when to stay their behinds home. Not everything will be ok to bring a child around in and that needs to be respected", "Your birthday party, your rules. If you're going into an environment that's bad for a two-month-old, especially with drugs involved, it's bad parenting on her part to bring her there.\n\nNote: I have been convinced that my argument was wrong.", "NTA. If you wanted a baby at the party, you would have invited one. \n\nMom needs to admit that those days are gone unless she arranges for childcare.", "NTA! \n\nNot sure why she thought taking her baby was a good idea. \nFor one sleeping arrangements: you said Airbnb, that means maybe sharing rooms and having your other friends hear a crying baby. You want this to be your fun 25th birthday with drinks and edibles, not an environment for a 2 month old baby. \nYou just have to be honest and tell her NO! It\u2019s your birthday  trip, and she can\u2019t just decide to bring the baby. I also feel that she won\u2019t be wanting to be out late, and friends feeling bad one always stays behind.\n\n\nHonestly tho, I doubt she\u2019ll go on the trip once her baby comes. Unless she\u2019s Mary Poppins she\u2019ll be super tired.", "NTA and I'm not sure she'll actually want to go on that kind of trip two months postpartum. \n\n(How to raise her baby? She's being ridiculous.)", "Never fails to amaze me when a clueless parent-to-be assumes their lives won\u2019t change after the baby arrives. Becoming a mom is the definition of a life-changing event.", "Nta in the slightest, it's ridiculous to even think bringing a baby along to a trip like this is a good idea let alone fair to either the group or the baby.", "NTA.  Your party, your guest list.  You don\u2019t have a say in how she raises her kid, but you do have a say in who\u2019s invited to your celebration.  And you can tell her you don\u2019t want kids there, if that\u2019s how you feel.  But understand that in excluding your friend\u2019s kid from your celebration you are tacitly excluding your friend as well.  And since she clearly wanted to be included you should expect her feelings to be hurt even if you are not wrong.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with a baby during my birthday weekend, especially on an edible. A newborn baby screaming in my ear while I\u2019m on an edible? On my birthday? Absolutely not. Not to mention having a newborn along will disrupt the entire day. You have to stop to feed the baby, change the baby. If the baby starts to scream or be disruptive, you might be asked to leave the aquarium, which would ruin your birthday. Not The Asshole at all. Your friend is ridiculous for thinking it\u2019s okay to bring a newborn baby along to a birthday weekend.", "Very simply NTA. Neither of you are. It\u2019s just not a suitable environment for a child. Maybe she could consider a babysitter or relative to watch the baby?", "There's too much that could go wrong bringing a 2 month old baby on a weekend trip.  Aside from just normal concerns, we are still in a pandemic.  She has no business bringing a baby to all that.\n\nNTA", "NTA - if this is your friends first child, it's likely she's very naive to the realities of having a newborn. At 2 months - you're in the thick of it; sleep deprived, overwhelmed and adjusting to a very different life. There will be days when going to the grocery store seems like a huge task, let alone a weekend away with a bunch of single people.", "NAH\n\nMy son is 2 months old. Going to Target is an adventure- I couldn\u2019t imagine an adult bday weekend. They\u2019re so dependent on you. They don\u2019t really have a schedule at this age. \nI would never bring my baby to such an event. It\u2019s inappropriate and infeasible.", "NTA. I agree with you that it doesn\u2019t seem like a good environment for a baby.  But that really isn\u2019t your call, and your friend might be more upset about you implicitly criticizing her judgement as a mom.  I would just say that it is an adults only party.  She is welcome to come on her own.  But she cannot bring her infant.  You don\u2019t really owe her an explanation.\n\nBut I think the whole discussion is a moot point.  I take it this is your friends 1st child?  If so, I doubt if she has a clue about how her life will be with a newborn, and what a huge investment of energy, time, and work she is in for.  My guess is she will be way too busy to take time out for a girls weekend, with or without her new born in tow.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
