I have a friend who\u2019s about to give birth any day now and our birthdays are ten days apart. I was hesitant to invite her in the first place since she\u2019s about to give birth but another friend let slip about my party so she basically asked if she could come along too. I said sure and then she said she would have to bring baby girl along.\n\nNow on this trip, I was hoping to cross a bucket list item off my list - taking edibles and going to an aquarium while in Chicago. Finishing the night off with KBBQ and drinking. An environment I wasn\u2019t comfortable having a baby around. My friend doesn\u2019t see the problem with bringing her two month old along at all.\n\nEveryone agrees with me. The baby shouldn\u2019t come with. My friend says that since I don\u2019t have kids, I shouldn\u2019t have a say in how she raises her baby. \n\nAITA?\n\nedit: this will be her third child, my apologies- i should have mentioned above. i\u2019ve never written a reddit post before :/", "created_utc": 1671160115, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zn4hdz/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_cant_bring_her/", "score": 1381, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend needs to grow up to the reality that when she has a child, she has to be an adult and a parent that means a change in her social activities.  She invited herself along on this outing; it's not a kiddy party so she probably better rethink that.", "You shouldn\u2019t have a say in how she raises her baby\u2026*BUT* you definitely have a say in what you planned for your bday weekend!!

Not to mention making poor choices as a new Mom.", "Don't tell her how to raise her kid. Fair enough. She can't tell you who to invite/allow on your trip.", "NTA I'm a parent and I agree that a baby would ruin this whole thing. A trippy girls weekend is no place for a (first-time??) mom and newborn!?! I feel for your friend but c'mon!", "NTA She\u2019s right you don\u2019t have a say in how she raised her child, BUT you have the right to decide who attends your birthday party!", "NTA it\u2019s totally OK to have an event where kids are not invited. It has nothing to do with a judgment on her parenting.  Who wants to deal with a crying baby on your edibles trip?", "NTA. There is a line to be drawn when trying to tell someone what to do with their baby, but this is not that situation. A two month old, still within newborn stage has zero business going here and there, in a large city, on a birthday weekend, in cold ass February, in public spaces, with diseases still swimming in the air. WHILE y\u2019all plan on being drunk and high. Your birthday weekend deserves to be free of children as well as responsibility towards people with children. \n\n**TL;DR: She\u2019s bugging bro**", "NTA, your reasoning is 100% correct. Maybe yall can do a dinner hangout or something to celebrate with her separately from this trip.", "NTA, does she think her baby is a purse?", "Info:\n\nDid you tell this perspective parent what the activities would consist of and that you wouldn\u2019t be modifying them to accommodate her?", "I have little kids and absolutely NTA. Having a baby or small children in a trip completely changes the vibe of the trip. You\u2019re allowed to want a fun, adults only weekend! \n\nWhen you choose to have kids, you need to understand that you\u2019re going to make sacrifices with your social life, especially in the beginning.

She has no idea what she's in for if she expects to make this trip, or even expects to make this kind of trip work with a newborn. \n\nYour right, it will ruin your trip and make it about her and that is very selfish of her to be this stubborn.", "NTA\n\nYour trip, your party, your rules.\n\nIf she's going tag along and bring an infant, the entire tone of the weekend will change.  If that's going to happen, you may as well cancel everything.\n\nTell her to stay home or let grandma keep the baby.\n\nGood Luck", "NTA. It's your birthday, and even if your friend is comfortable with having her daughter in that situation, you aren't. If she were to bring her daughter, you would feel guilt for something that you've had on your bucket list for a while.\n\nI'd say you need to have a conversation with your friend, and make it clear to her that you aren't judging her parenting, just that you want to be able to enjoy your birthday in the way you want without feeling uncomfortable that there is a child present. \n\nIt's also probably a good idea to ask *why* she is so adamant about bringing her child along. Is she having issues finding or affording childcare? It wouldn't change the verdict of NTA, but you may be able to have a more constructive conversation with your friend if you understand the reasons behind the issue. Being a new mom is really hard, and sometimes being without your child for a few days is a lot harder than it may seem, both logistically and emotionally.\n\nEdit to add: I misread, the event is far enough away that the childcare issue is probably not the issue. Still, a conversation is in order", "NTA \n\nEnjoy your birthday, sounds like a fun trip! Definitely not a place for a baby though. It\u2019s your birthday, you get to choose who comes. Why would anyone think this trip is one a baby should go on?", "Nta \n\nYour not telling her how to raise her child you just simply don't want her child at your birthday celebration", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to tell her \u201cI really wish you could come! But this isn\u2019t a child friendly event. The activities planned are not safe for a baby and I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable putting any of us in that situation. I am happy to make separate plans that are baby friendly on another day with you though.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like she has wishful thinking if the baby isn\u2019t born yet. She may not fully understand what bringing the baby will entail in reality.", "NTA. \n\nThat trip is not appropriate for a 2 month year old. You are going to get intoxicated and hit the town. You don\u2019t take a baby for that. \n\nAnd any time someone goes, you don\u2019t have kids you don\u2019t have a voice in how I raise mine, that\u2019s guaranteed they are doing bad parenting behavior and are looking for an excuse to shut down complaints", "Oh my.  You have a baby.....in a bar.  Hmmm.", "There is a reason relationships with single friends change when someone has a child.  NTA.", "NTA. Some people with kids don\u2019t understand they\u2019re not invited everywhere.", "NTA it\u2019s just ridiculous to bring a baby to a grown person\u2018s birthday weekend where they\u2019re going to do drugs and drink. Now you\u2019ve got time delays because you have to pack a car seat ( if you\u2019re driving) ,diaper bag full of her supplies and a stroller.  You know someone is going to end up having to assist her with her infant at some point. It\u2019s best she not go honestly tell her it\u2019s a child free weekend.", "NTA. \n\nI'm surprised that she'd be in the mood emotionally and physically to travel for a birthday weekend with a two month old. My first thought was - this must be the first kid so she has no idea what she's getting into... but THIRD kid and she's considering it?!\n\nMy guess is that she's kinda bummed that she can't join \"normal\" 25yr old activities cause she's a mom and she wants to try to do it all. Two month olds don't even sleep through the night... Who does she plan on bunkering with? How are you guys getting there? Will she be trying to carry her suitcase + baby's + stroller etc? Would be baby's immune system be alright to travel and be exposed to so many environments? It isn't really fun to try to bring everything you need for a baby to different locations and moving around. Does she really think she's going to have any fun? (not even considering how the activities planed are not at all baby compatible...)\n\nI'd try to have an empathic sit down with her and understand why she'd want to put herself through that... If she's feeling left out, you guys can offer to do a dinner back home and celebrate again some other time. She can get proper childcare for the occasion and even \"let loose a little\"/ get some time with her friends.", "NTA- As someone who use to enjoy doing stuff like this before my son. You have to be responsible when you have a kid and that means not being able to do things you use to. You didn\u2019t invent and tell her to ditch her kid. She found out and you invested her to be nice.", "NTA at all. I get that your friend doesn't want to be left out of things, but having a baby will significantly change the dynamic of any gathering, especially one that is 2 months old. The baby will still be crying at all times of the day and night and needing to be fed and nap every few hours, so your friend will likely not be able to participate in a lot of things. It's not really far to you and the rest of the group to have to put up with a crying baby or being quiet around the baby when it naps or needs to feed.", "NTA, but does your friend know what your plans are? Does she know about the edibles, late night drinking, and whatever other shenanigans you plan to get up to? \n\nHaving a baby that young will likely be taxing on her to keep up. She has no idea what new demands her baby will make on her sleep and energy levels. Personally, I would be hesitant to make such a big plan right after having a baby just because I don't know how I'll be functioning then.", "NTA: There is nothing wrong with wanting a child free celebration. It doesn't matter what the reason is. You've asked for a child free celebration and your friends should honor that or not attend if they cannot make arrangements for their children. That is what happens when you choose to have children sometimes.", "NTA, \n\nPeople need to understand when to stay their behinds home. Not everything will be ok to bring a child around in and that needs to be respected", "Your birthday party, your rules. If you're going into an environment that's bad for a two-month-old, especially with drugs involved, it's bad parenting on her part to bring her there.\n\nNote: I have been convinced that my argument was wrong.", "NTA. If you wanted a baby at the party, you would have invited one. \n\nMom needs to admit that those days are gone unless she arranges for childcare.", "NTA! \n\nNot sure why she thought taking her baby was a good idea. \nFor one sleeping arrangements: you said Airbnb, that means maybe sharing rooms and having your other friends hear a crying baby. You want this to be your fun 25th birthday with drinks and edibles, not an environment for a 2 month old baby. \nYou just have to be honest and tell her NO! It\u2019s your birthday  trip, and she can\u2019t just decide to bring the baby. I also feel that she won\u2019t be wanting to be out late, and friends feeling bad one always stays behind.\n\n\nHonestly tho, I doubt she\u2019ll go on the trip once her baby comes. Unless she\u2019s Mary Poppins she\u2019ll be super tired.", "NTA and I'm not sure she'll actually want to go on that kind of trip two months postpartum. \n\n(How to raise her baby? She's being ridiculous.)", "Never fails to amaze me when a clueless parent-to-be assumes their lives won\u2019t change after the baby arrives. Becoming a mom is the definition of a life-changing event.", "Nta in the slightest, it's ridiculous to even think bringing a baby along to a trip like this is a good idea let alone fair to either the group or the baby.", "NTA.  Your party, your guest list.  You don\u2019t have a say in how she raises her kid, but you do have a say in who\u2019s invited to your celebration.  And you can tell her you don\u2019t want kids there, if that\u2019s how you feel.  But understand that in excluding your friend\u2019s kid from your celebration you are tacitly excluding your friend as well.  And since she clearly wanted to be included you should expect her feelings to be hurt even if you are not wrong.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t want to deal with a baby during my birthday weekend, especially on an edible. A newborn baby screaming in my ear while I\u2019m on an edible? On my birthday? Absolutely not. Not to mention having a newborn along will disrupt the entire day. You have to stop to feed the baby, change the baby. If the baby starts to scream or be disruptive, you might be asked to leave the aquarium, which would ruin your birthday. Not The Asshole at all. Your friend is ridiculous for thinking it\u2019s okay to bring a newborn baby along to a birthday weekend.", "Very simply NTA. Neither of you are. It\u2019s just not a suitable environment for a child. Maybe she could consider a babysitter or relative to watch the baby?", "There's too much that could go wrong bringing a 2 month old baby on a weekend trip.  Aside from just normal concerns, we are still in a pandemic.  She has no business bringing a baby to all that.\n\nNTA", "NTA - if this is your friends first child, it's likely she's very naive to the realities of having a newborn. At 2 months - you're in the thick of it; sleep deprived, overwhelmed and adjusting to a very different life. There will be days when going to the grocery store seems like a huge task, let alone a weekend away with a bunch of single people.", "NAH\n\nMy son is 2 months old. Going to Target is an adventure- I couldn\u2019t imagine an adult bday weekend. They\u2019re so dependent on you. They don\u2019t really have a schedule at this age. \nI would never bring my baby to such an event. It\u2019s inappropriate and infeasible.", "NTA. I agree with you that it doesn\u2019t seem like a good environment for a baby.  But that really isn\u2019t your call, and your friend might be more upset about you implicitly criticizing her judgement as a mom.  I would just say that it is an adults only party.  She is welcome to come on her own.  But she cannot bring her infant.  You don\u2019t really owe her an explanation.\n\nBut I think the whole discussion is a moot point.  I take it this is your friends 1st child?  If so, I doubt if she has a clue about how her life will be with a newborn, and what a huge investment of energy, time, and work she is in for.  My guess is she will be way too busy to take time out for a girls weekend, with or without her new born in tow.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s not going to be able to keep up with a bunch of carefree 25 year olds out partying in the city. \n\nIf the father doesn\u2019t come along to help out, she\u2019s just straight up a bad mother for thinking late night drinking in Chicago is an appropriate environment for a 2 month old baby. It would be a struggle to even find a bar willing to let her in, and I really wouldn\u2019t want to spend time in a bar that actually let her come in.", "Not to mention we\u2019re in the middle of a tripledemic and the last place a baby too young to be vaccinated needs to be is at an aquarium on a \u201cgirls trip.\u201d", "And that is how she can have her children taken away from her by thinking such nonsense. If the daddy is in the picture can\u2019t imagine he would be thinking it\u2019s okay. Or her mom. I would be tattling to them in best interest of child. NTA.", "And you're not telling her how to raise her kid. You are telling her how you want your birthday getaway to go and it doesn't involve a 2 month old.\n\nThere's nothing stopping her from going to Chicago on her own and doing the same things you're gonna do herself ***with*** her baby and all her kids in tow. She just won't be able to pawn off her kids on any friends and make them responsible if she goes on her own.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like she will even be able to do any of the activities you have planned, except maybe the KBBQ. \n\nShe absolutely should not be taking edibles or going to bars while taking care of a 2 month old baby, especially if she\u2019s breastfeeding. \n\nAnd she won\u2019t even have the energy to stay awake for the entire night anyways. \n\nShe could maybe come to the aquarium, and then have zero fun while  the rest of you wander around stoned off your asses and she takes care of a fussy baby who won\u2019t even remember the trip.  She might make it to dinner, but after that it will be time to put the baby to bed, and then she will have to stay there the whole night. \n\nThe whole trip would just be a waste of money for her, which would be less relaxing than just staying home, because at least at home she has the baby\u2019s father to help.", "Makes it even worse. A first time mom can somewhat be excused by having no idea what having a child means and how it truly impacts your life. A third time mom, should know better.", "somehow i get the feeling he's either not much better or not in the picture outside of being the main accident of this particular year.", "Be prepared to completely zone out while watching some exotic underwater snail \ud83e\udd23", "Look that was a terrible suggestion (the baby should not be coming to Chicago at all) but also, it\u2019s okay if she thinks you\u2019re trying to ditch her and \u201csecretly don\u2019t like her\u201d. She made that up for herself and you are not responsible for preventing offenses she\u2019s creating. \n\nStop caving to her unreasonable expectations.", "Glad I'm not friends w you.", "Haha lol yes but with a 2 month old baby you probably won\u2019t get much sleep. The mom will probably find out soon. My baby had a lot of trouble sleeping the first 10 weeks. Now he sleeps well, but the first couple of weeks were a nightmare. I could barely get out of the house on time let alone going on a weekend with friends (without drugs). A baby needs a lot of stuff. A LOT. At home you have everything but when you go to a hotel you need to take all the things with you. I don\u2019t say it can\u2019t be done but it is just a lot of work. And with drugs involved it is not a safe place for a baby indeed. \n\nIn my country there was a case of a mother who was addicted and her baby roamed around the room when she could not care for the girl. And the girl got some drugs in her system. It was later found in her bottle by the police. The girl barely survived.So it is very dangerous to do drugs around kids.", "> The baby is not welcome\"\n\nDON'T say that. Awful phrasing and unnecessarily hostile. DO say something along the lines of, \"I'm so sorry but it won't be appropriate for the baby to be there with all these adult activities going on\".", "No, we don't need to coddle people like this.  She isn't taking no for an answer and needs to get the picture.  Straight up tell her no, this is not happening.", "Any adult only event is inappropriate for children", "Literally never said that, but that maybe she could join in on stuff like the aquarium or dinner. \n\nAnyway all this is probably a moot point as OP's friend hasn't had the baby yet and I'd bet the house that she will probably change her mind about going when she's exhausted with a newborn.", "Most likely they came from people who actually know what it's like to have a baby. A girls trip with a 2 month old is not feasible. At all. Those girls want to have fun, not to listen to your crying child, or to cater for your mommy needs.", "I'm pregnant and have a child already. I would NEVER lug a baby around on a trip while people are drinking and getting high and travelling around. I been downvoting all your comments because you are just as selfish, entitled, and delusional as OPs friend. It wouldn't be any fun for the mother or other people involved. I BET the friend will get pissy when the group is out having fun drinking & coming back to air BNB loud & drunk; and then the group will be pissy when they're woken up every few hours to a crying baby while being hungover. Sounds dumb bringing a baby to that. Also, the friend will have to lug around so much stuff for her baby and you KNOW she will force everyone else to help her carry that stuff around. You wanna be selfish & inconsiderate & inconvenience everyone just have a weekend of \"fun\" where you will be turned away from bars anyways? Like just stay home? I would. Doesn't sound fun to me.", "It's not coddling. It's called using tact in communication. Being blunt about the baby is likely to get a sensitive mother's back up and twist the narrative into dislike of the baby itself, when that's not the issue. This person isn't a harrasser that needs to told to jog on immediately. There is no need to be blunt. It is important when dealing with actual friends to keep calm, and use appropriate language. My suggestion is polite, makes the point, doesn't escalate, and doesn't turn the issue into something more.", "She was never invited. The friend asked to come and OP ended up saying yes, but OP and the rest of the group don't want a baby there. And neither OP or group are assholes for not wanting a little baby there."]}
