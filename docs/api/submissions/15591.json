I can understand why my sister did this as my parents can be toxic at times. (They can be toxic physically and mentally) What drove her away was, when she was a few months away from her 18th birthday she was grounded for a month because instead of coming home after work she stayed a little to long talking to her bf in the parking lot. My parents tracked her location when she wasn't home right away and showed up at her job parking lot , they cussed her out and her boyfriend and threatened to call the cops on him.I still live at home as an adult because I am in college full time and I can not afford to live on my own. ( it does take a toll on my mental health) Anyways my parents found out my sister bought a house and they figured out the location of the house and they are going to try to talk to her . Keep in mind they have tried to do this in the past and it never ends well. It always ends with yelling and the cops being called. My parents told me about how they know where she lives and talked about stopping by her house and talking to her and I said this was a bad idea because obviously she hasn't tried to reach out so she doesn't want anything to do with our family. My mom started yelling at me, saying, \"I'm inconsiderate of their feelings, and  she's my daughter, you don't understand.\" They are saying im choosing sides and threatening to kick me out of the house, but I generally  feel like they are starting unnecessary drama.

They can\u2019t read a room.", "NTA But since you need to live at home right now- I'd have not said anything.\n\nObviously you should make sure that you have any paperwork you need in a safe place so if you need to quickly get you can get. But for now, you know that your parents aren't going to listen to anything you say- their opinions are the only ones that matter. \n\nSo the best option is to let them experience the repercussions on those decisions.

I am now an adult with adult kids - she keeps trying to get in contact with me and my kids - we just ignore her.  The good news is- she lives over 1500+ miles away so she cannot just drop in.  God help her if she ever got the idea to come for a visit because I would be like your sister - I would have her ass tossed off my property so fast her head would spin clear off.  \n\nWith that being said, I think that you may just want to not say anything at all this why - I have siblings as well.  I don't expect them to deal with her on my behalf and in fact I know because of how toxic it is for them to deal with her that it is best if they just avoid her and conservations about me if they do get subjected to her abuse.  **I understand full well how she is, and I don't want my siblings taking any abuse on my behalf.  Two, it is not going to change anything - they are just going to go over and show up and show out.

They honestly sound very narcissistic And if so can understand whyyyyyy she left.

I hope soon you can move out and have some peace at home", "Close your account and open a new one without their names on it. You can likely rent a bedroom somewhere else for $800 or less a month. They are forcing you to be financially dependent on them so that you can't leave. They will steal your money if they have access to your account and you do anything, no matter how small that causes them to worry you will leave.", "Create new account that they don't have access to, this is financial abuse and ultimately not worth it in the long run because you can't even bide your time, your going to graduate and still not have enough to leave, there are places where you can probably rent rooms put for this price, and at least you'll have your peace of mind.\n\n\nAnd speak to your sister, reach out via  text, warn her about your parents trying to find her  also ask sincerely if she has any advice on how you can help yourself get from under your parents thumb like she did. She might be sympathetic but don't push her on it.", "Holy shit this is financial abuse. They\u2019re taking all your money so you can\u2019t escape. This is a classic financial abuse tactic. Can you talk to a counsellor or something? Or maybe open a secret account? This is really worrying.", "NTA\n\nIs there a way that you can contact her boyfriend, his family or one of her friends to warn her about what your parents are planning.\n\nAlso, her knowing that you are trying to give her a heads up on what your parents are planning and letting her know that you wish you could escape too, might be something that could open up a line of communication between the two of you.", "Was thinking about dming  one of her friends to warn her !", "NTA.  Get away from the toxicity.", "NTA\nWhile you want to finish school at what cost. Finish the semester and take a break to save up and leave. Get a roommate. If giving your opinion is gonna turn to you being on the street better to break away.", "You're working 30 hours a week. Change bank accounts, save the $800 your parents are stealing from you, put a deposit on your own place and move. Block your parents on all media and don't leave a forwarding address. \nYour mental health will improve, you'll be able to focus on school, and you may even get your sister back.\n\nThe only reason you think you have to stay is learned helplessness. Learn from your sister. Get out.", "Can you do a loan and live in a dorm?", "NTA\n\nYou are absolutely right. Any interaction between your sister and your parents (based on past experiences and how they left things) is going to be a shitshow. Nothing good will come of it. And I can understand a mother missing her daughter, but this is verging on stalking and harassing behavior. If the daughter wants nothing to do with the parents, the parents should leave her alone. Simple as that. I'm surprised the sister hasn't gotten a restraining order on them yet.", "NTA. But, for your own emotional health, I think you should stay out of it. Your parents are bad people, they are always going to be bad people, and they aren\u2019t every going to listen to good advice.", "NTA *however,* you should drop things for your own sake. Your parents are very unlikely to be convinced by what you say. If they cared about their children's opinions, they wouldn't be in this situation to begin with (nor would they keep showing up at your sister's house). For your own sake, let it go. Make sure you have secure housing before you challenge them on things like this. \n\nI also saw in the comments that your mom has access to your accounts. Open a secret account immediately to start depositing money in. Plan a lie to explain the lack of extra money coming into your main account. When you are in a position where you can leave, speak to your bank about the best solution for dealing with the old account. \n\nGo to student resources and ask about what they have available for students. They might have food pantries and other resources that will keep you afloat if you do have to suddenly move out. \n\nAlso, I saw you're paying them $800/month. Depending on where you live, you probably can get comparable or slightly cheaper housing than that if you live with roommates. Is staying there actually helping you that much financially?", "I really hope she gets one soon bc it's literally insane behavior.", "Does she have a childhood friend who would trust you or is there a cousin?\n\nDo not expect any contact or hold out false hope.\n\n\u201cHi it\u2019s Xs sister Y.  Our parents have found your address and are actively planning to force contact by showing up. I don\u2019t know anything further but I wanted you to be prepared\u201d", "You are being abused. Please contact a domestic violence hotline - on a friend's phone - for advice on saving to escape. For instance, you might be able to \"buy their groceries,\" but pull part of it as cash, and hide the cash. The receipt would look like you spent all the $ on them. You could build up a run fund if you did this several times.\n\nDo not use your own phone or computer to look for help. They may have keystroke loggers on your devices. Use a school or library computer. Ask at your school counseling center.\n\nDMing your sister's friend is a great idea. For her and your safety. Keep up the good work. You are a good and strong person. You can do this.", "This! Please take this step OP!", "That could work!", "If that's your only means of warning her, you might want to take that route.", "NTA  You tried.  But like you said they're toxic and there's nothing you can do to stop toxic people from doing toxic things.  \n\nGet out as soon as you can.", "NTA.\n\nBut a more pragmatic and helpful thing might be just to keep your peace and let your sister know what they are trying to do. Be her inside mole.", "NTA\n\nBut why are you still there? In 5 years, surely you've graduated college.\n\nMove out.\n\nGet a roommate, get two roommates.\n\nMove out.", "You're over 18. Open your own bsnk account. Get a roommate and spend $800/month on tent someehere else.", "I think DMing a friend is a good idea because it means you're not trying to get around the blocks. It's respectful of her boundaries, she doesn't have to have communication with you at all (unless she decides she wants to by now then she can ask her friend what your account is for up to date contact info, though I suspect that's not super likely).", "Don't be so sure of that. If you wanted to leave, I suspect she would help you escape.", "Talk to your college's student services counsellor about getting a dorm room, applying for a loan, etc. You may be surprised what's available to you if you're leaving a domestic abuse situation."]}
