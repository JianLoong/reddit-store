I can understand why my sister did this as my parents can be toxic at times. (They can be toxic physically and mentally) What drove her away was, when she was a few months away from her 18th birthday she was grounded for a month because instead of coming home after work she stayed a little to long talking to her bf in the parking lot. My parents tracked her location when she wasn't home right away and showed up at her job parking lot , they cussed her out and her boyfriend and threatened to call the cops on him.I still live at home as an adult because I am in college full time and I can not afford to live on my own. ( it does take a toll on my mental health) Anyways my parents found out my sister bought a house and they figured out the location of the house and they are going to try to talk to her . Keep in mind they have tried to do this in the past and it never ends well. It always ends with yelling and the cops being called. My parents told me about how they know where she lives and talked about stopping by her house and talking to her and I said this was a bad idea because obviously she hasn't tried to reach out so she doesn't want anything to do with our family. My mom started yelling at me, saying, \"I'm inconsiderate of their feelings, and  she's my daughter, you don't understand.\" They are saying im choosing sides and threatening to kick me out of the house, but I generally  feel like they are starting unnecessary drama.

If they keep trying to contact your sister and start showing up at her house they're going to have a restraining order placed against them by your sister I can almost guarantee it.

But your parents are overbearing egotists that seem incapable of listening or learning. There is no point in your talking to them about it.  They'll go there, get into a fight, get the cops called and may be hit with a restraining order or the like. Nothing to be done. \n\nBTW do you have any contact with your sister? \n\nGood luck in college and getting out yourself.", "NTA they are stalking your sister. That\u2019s scary!", ">They are saying im choosing sides and threatening to kick me out of the house\n\nOmg they don't learn do they? You're NTA", "NTA, but you really should warn your sister if you can.\n\nI hope you can finish school soon so you can move out of what sounds like a toxic environment", "Does your sister have any room for you at her place? It sounds to me like you should really get out of there also. NTA", "NTA. They can\u2019t read a room.", "NTA But since you need to live at home right now- I'd have not said anything.\n\nObviously you should make sure that you have any paperwork you need in a safe place so if you need to quickly get you can get. But for now, you know that your parents aren't going to listen to anything you say- their opinions are the only ones that matter. \n\nSo the best option is to let them experience the repercussions on those decisions. By all means, tell your sister- hey mom and dad have your new address. But otherwise- for your mental health- stay out.", "NtAH - I don't speak to my toxic - abusive - egg donor at all either - I moved out before I was 18 and took her to court to stop her from trying to force me back to Texas.  I am now an adult with adult kids - she keeps trying to get in contact with me and my kids - we just ignore her.  The good news is- she lives over 1500+ miles away so she cannot just drop in.  God help her if she ever got the idea to come for a visit because I would be like your sister - I would have her ass tossed off my property so fast her head would spin clear off.  \n\nWith that being said, I think that you may just want to not say anything at all this why - I have siblings as well.  I don't expect them to deal with her on my behalf and in fact I know because of how toxic it is for them to deal with her that it is best if they just avoid her and conservations about me if they do get subjected to her abuse.  **I understand full well how she is, and I don't want my siblings taking any abuse on my behalf.  Two, it is not going to change anything - they are just going to go over and show up and show out.  That is on them 100%.**  \n\nI doubt she wants you to get abused on her behalf - I know I don't want that for my siblings.", "NTA", "The only reason you might be an A is because you didn't warn your sister.", "NTA but nothing good can come from you trying to stop them. Let them ruin that relationship all on their own", "NTA\n\nbut your situation is a bit precarious. Protect ya neck.", "Honestly maybe them showing up unannounced having very obviously stalked the sister will be the final nail that she needs to get the restraining order. \n\nOP should find a way to warn their sister, that way she can be prepared and get the ball rolling to ensure these abusers stay away for good.", "Yes OP should be contacting the sister if they can, to warn her about what the parents are staying they're going to do", "She blocked my number and socials due to me having contact with them . I haven't talked to her in 5 years so I doubt she would help me get out.", "NTA, and yes I'm going to double down on warning your sister. If you are still able to contact her, text her the general warning and perhaps a \"heads up\" if they tell you they are on their way over. Perhaps your sister can get some cameras up to record it and support a restraining order request. If your parents pay for your phone though, don't use that - call or text from a friend's phone.", "OK, if you can't warn her, then document what your parents are telling you and behavior you oserve related to this. Ex: Do you know how they found out where she lived? \n\nAt least it is info she can use if she needs a restraining order and you can send it to her lawyer if it gets that far.", "If you have her address,  send her a postcard to warn her.  Tell her that you understand her position, miss her, and that you will not contact her again. Give her your phone number and let her know that you will accept her calls if she wants to get in contact with you. \n\nGood luck."]}
