He\u2019s not prioritising himself or you, but his sisters and father instead. That\u2019s his money, so it\u2019s his choice. But if he wants to be an adult with his own home etc, he really needs to think about how much he\u2019s prioritising them and if he can scale back how much he helps them.

However, when you mentioned that he travels home every three months (and spends money on his trip I guess?) and buys extravagant gifts for his sister, that concerned me. You should talk with your boyfriend and explain that sacrifices are necessary in life to achieve your goals. Encourage him to contribute money to the mortgage instead of spending it on frequent travel and expensive gifts.
