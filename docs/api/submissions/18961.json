It\u2019s not like his name will *never* be on the deed, just temporarily until he can pay his half. I think that\u2019s more than fair. \n\nI\u2019m not the type of person to jump to the \u201cdump him\u201d remarks, but you may need to reevaluate some things. He\u2019s not prioritising himself or you, but his sisters and father instead. That\u2019s his money, so it\u2019s his choice. But if he wants to be an adult with his own home etc, he really needs to think about how much he\u2019s prioritising them and if he can scale back how much he helps them. It\u2019s a shitty situation with his father\u2019s health, for sure. And I empathise with that, as I\u2019m sure you do too. But whilst they\u2019re financially dependent on him, he can\u2019t be free and financially support himself. \n\nThe good news here is that you live with family rent-free. Even if you started paying them rent, you still have a roof over your head whilst your indecisive boyfriend straightens his finances out. Okay, you may not get the exact home you want. But in the short term, you have a place to live and can continue to save money. In the long run, you\u2019ll be glad that you made the decisions you made. \n\nOf course, this is *my* opinion, and others may not agree. *You* may not agree with me.

That's ridiculous, and if he moves in it does not mean he's exempt from paying rent.\n\nThere's a lot of messy legal nonsense and actions that come if you guys break up and have a deed with both of your names on it. It would be different if you guys decided to rent, as both of your names would have to be on a lease, but buying a house is a lot more serious.\n\nLiterally it is so much better to wait to get a house with your partner once you guys get married and/or put both of y'all's names on a deed.\n\nEveryone here is telling you this is for the best and it's for a reason.

Seriously don't do it. \n\nIf you can afford the place on your own then I would tell you to buy it and not put his name of the deed and set up a rental agreement with him.\n\nBut since you can't afford the loan on your own I would just stay doing what you are doing.", "NTA, but you haven't even lived with him yet! You are *severely* underestimating how a relationship can change when you're in a shared-household situation with chores and bills and being in each other's space constantly. Buying somewhere together that you cannot afford without each other is a BAD idea. \n\nIt's only been a year. If the relationship breaks down because you realise you hate each other after living together a while (it happens a lot!), what then??  Buying it solo and having him contribute to the mortgage payment would be a better option regardless of his family situation, at least then you might be able to rent out a spare room to cover the mortgage if shit hits the fan.

You can afford the deposit but not the mortgage. \n\nPutting the house only in your name until he pays you back, which is sensible, means to him, I presume, that you don't trust that the relationship will last/or that he will pay the money back.

However, if you put the house in his name and he doesn't pay, he will be entitled to money from the sell of the house.\n\nIf you put the house soly in your name, and then you break up, you are left with all the debts, and may end up losing the house because you won't be able to pay the mortgage.\n\nWhy not buy something where you can pay the deposit and mortgage.
