It would have been real weird for you to call his mom and ask after his dad already said to go ahead.", "NTA. Your stepson asked you to give him a buzzcut and you asked him if he was sure and got confirmation from his dad. It sounds like your stepson was very happy with the result and that should be the most important thing. It's understandable that his mom was upset, but it's not like you made the decision without consulting anyone. You also didn't feed into any drama, which is always a good thing.", "NTA - age 10 is old enough to decide for himself that he wants short hair.  It will grow back.  Only if there had been any pressure, subtle bribes, or subtle punishments would I think the mom had a case.", "NTA. Father approved. Unless they communicate and agree on every haircut or hairstyle, dad has a right just like mother does seeing as how it\u2019s 50/50. Went through this with my step kids.", "You got the dad\u2019s permission. You didn\u2019t make the decision yourself. Dad has equal custody and just as much right to make that decision.

You asked him if he was sure and he said yeah.\n\nYou did nothing wrong", "NTA.  Dad said it was OK, and even filmed it.\n\nBUT:  I have this crazy image in my head from this line: \"I shouldn't have allowed him to do it implosively\". :)", "NTA, the kid wanted his hair cut.  Communication with his mom is on your husband, not you.  I could see being a little taken aback as a mom and picking my kid with a drastically different hair style with no warning, but not something that should be shoved back at you. Her beef is with her ex, not you.  \n\nYour husband could have warned her that their son was getting a cut, but ultimately it\u2019s what the kid wanted.  His hair his choice. A hair cut isn\u2019t permanent, and if the kid regrets it later, it will eventually grow back.", "NTA\n\n1. It\u2019s your husbands responsibility to communicate with his ex about it after you told him, and before him telling you to go ahead\n\n2. If your stepson really wants a buzzcut, his mum should probably let him try it", "NTA. 10 years old is old enough to decide on a haircut.  Dad's permission is sufficient.  \n\nDoes everyone voting Y T A think if mom said no, the kid shouldn't be allowed to cut his hair?  How old does he need to be before he can choose his haircut without needing permission from both parents?  Ludicrous.", "NTA it's only hair, he's old enough to choose for himself, the dad had no problem. I'll bet no one in a nuclear family is forced to receive the blessing of both parents separately before changing their hair, one parent takes them to the hairdresser and that's that. This woman is being a drama llama.", "NTA! \n\nYou discussed it w/ one parent. Dad should\u2019ve relayed the message. Obviously step son wasn\u2019t happy w his appearance & wanted a change lol", "NTA.  In a scenario like this of split custody, each parent has authority over the child when the child is over, and defers to the other parent when the child is there.  Optimally the ex-spouses must coordinate on big things (choice of school kind of things) but ... a haircut?  Nah.\n\nNote also that as stepmother, you and husband have to decide how active a role in parenting you're to take.  Sounds like in this case you're very active and involved, so great!\n\nTo recap...  don't worry.  Lots of boys want to shave their heads at one point or another.  It'll grow back.", "NTA.....At 10 he is old enough to make his own decision", "NTA\n\nThis one is on your husband.", "NTA. You did ask his dad, why would you ask his Mom, too? I don\u2019t know, if the kid wanted it and one parent said ok, I don\u2019t see a problem. Kid will probably have lots of hairstyles Mom will hate.\n \u2026..and do we not allow 10 year olds to dictate their own hairstyles in 2023? If the kid said shave it, why is there even an argument?", "It's his body and hair. He asked for it, and his father was there.\n\nThe mother is just looking for something to complain about. \n\nNTA even more so for not responding to her drama. \n\nShe obviously doesn't understand that her son's happiness comes first.", "NTA. It\u2019s great that your stepson was included and got what he wanted. Mom has some right to be able to veto appearance changes, but that should be less and less every year. \n\nShe probably deserves a courtesy apology from you or dad, and some sort of \u201cnext time do this\u201d agreement.", "You got permission from dad. He shares custody. He gets to make medical decisions too. A haircut is not chopping off his leg. YNTA", "NTA.  He specifically asked you to cut his hair.  At his age he's definitely old enough to start making decisions about his own appearance.  Your husband also approved it.  Haircut's also aren't permanent.  Depending on everyone's relationship dynamic I do think either you or your husband should have reached out to her to at least let her know it was happening, or even initiated an actual discussion about it before making the decision.", "NTA - a 10-year-old should be able to make their own decision on a haircut. It isn\u2019t permanent, and unless his mom checks with his dad before every cut, then the dad was well within his rights to agree with his son\u2019s request. \n\nIf this was a toddler, I could understand both parents wanting to have a say. But this is a 10-year-old and his 50% custodial parent said yes.", "NTA  Son requested. Dad gave permission. It was a standard haircut.  Nothing crazy, no hair dye or chemicals used. It doesn\u2019t sound like there were any cultural/religious reasons for this to be a problem.  If Dad had taken him to the barbershop instead it sounds like the outcome would be the same.  It will grow back, and a 10 year old is old enough to make reasonable decisions about his appearance.  It sounds like Mom was the only one who had an issue - which may or may not have anything to do with his choosing to cut his hair short.", "NTA. Kid asked you to do it, father consented and participated during his own time. Her beef is with her ex husband's parenting deciding, not with you.  She's just making drama because it's easy to be mad at you.", "It doesn't matter what any parents thinks of a child's hair, honestly. If they want it, they should  get it! Especially when it's just a simple cut that doesn't require any extra maintenance. Why would it be a problem for a kid to explore and express themselves how they want to? Sounds like his mom has some serious control issues, or she doesn't want her kids to have individuality. I'm glad that he mentioned wanting a haircut to you and not to her, as he might have had his hopes crushed. NTA at all!", "NTA. You asked the kids dad, he agreed. The kid also agreed. It's your husbands job to check with his ex, if he doesn't know if she would agree.", "NTA - and this isn't about the haircut.  This is about you being part of a decision that she wasn't part of, while normalizing the fact that she feels like she has absolute control over her son's body to justify her position to make you the problem.", "NTA \n\nit's the kid's head. Neither one of you own the hair and you even waited until the kid's father was home before doing it so it's not like you threw the kid to the ground and forced a hair cut on him.\n\nYou be as implosive as you want.", "nta kid is old enough to decide on his own and you asked his father who has 50/50 custody.. you didn\u2019t force him so mom just needs to let this one go", "NTA. Ten year olds are old enough to choose their own hairstyle. The fact that she messaged you about it after calling his father says a lot. Send her the video.", "I have a feeling she mostly was mad because she felt \"left out\"", "NTA. Let\u2019s face it, Mum\u2019s issue is with you and not the haircut.", "NTA.  He's old enough to make this kind of decision on his own. It's just hair and not permanent.  It's not like he was the 4 or 5 year old. His mommy needs to let him grow up a little.", " NTA. Dad was there, kid wanted it, no worries. My motto with all my kids has always been your hair, you business, even if I don\u2019t like it. I always told them, you want a green Mohawk?  Bows the time, it a hell of a lot harder to have that at 30 than at 16. It\u2019s just hair, it grows back.", "NTA, \n\nBUT\n\nI do think y'all should have at least said something to her. My ex buzzed our son's long beautiful hair and for good reason (he is autistic and took to pulling it out in frustration) but I would've liked a heads up. I arrived to pick my son up at my mom's and I was taken aback. I guess I wanted to be in the know and the surprise was a lot. Apparently I did not hide my feelings about it, as they were plastered all over my face.\n\nYour stepson is old enough to decipher his hair and his dad gave the ok, so you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou had permission from both the person whose hair was being cut and from their legal guardian.  If mom needed to be looped in, that was on dad not OP.\n\nYou also did right by not responding.  She had no right to come at you, she needs to discuss any issues she has with her coparent.\n\nMy oldest always did a wild thing in the summer with his hair when he was a kid.  Buzz cut one year, mohawk another, dyed red another, etc.  So both my ex and I were used to him getting returned with a radically different hair style than they dropped him off with depending on who had him at the time of his hair cut.  Was never a big deal and we had fun with it.\n\nCurrently he is 19 and with long white hair year round.  Looks like he could have stepped out of an anime", "NTA. You asked his dad and he agreed. It was on him to notify his sons mother not yours.", "NTA, though your husband could have given a heads up to the mother", "As a \"step\" parent myself if we want to do something big I give mom a heads up out of courtesy. We have a very good relationship though. NTA either way because dad gave permission.", "I'm going with NTA because he is 10, my children have always decided how they want their hair! At 10 he's old enough to make a decision, I too would be upset with a drastically different change on my child so she does have a right to be upset maybe a text letting her know would have been good! But overall he had a parents permission and wanted it sooooo as long as he's happy that SHOULD be all the matters", "NTA, good move on ignoring the mother.  Don\u2019t feed the beast.\nGood luck, I\u2019m sure some conversations will need to happen.  But the kid is old enough and dad/you don\u2019t need her permission to cut his hair (the way he wanted!)", "NTA \n\nYou checked with his dad and got the green light. Also, your step son requested it and he's old enough to have a day in his appearance. And it's not a permanent change. \n\nThose 3 things are enough to make me vote NTA. But I also appreciate that you stepped back and tried to see it from the moms perspective. Maybe in a few days when things cal. down a little, you could approach her and have a short conversation. Acknowledged that you weren't trying to upset her and you thought getting his dad's permission was enough. Let her know that you wouldn't do anything serious or permanent without talking to her. I don't think you absolutely have to do this,  but it might help co parenting go more smoothly going forward.", "You're not an A, but I will say it was inconsiderate to not talk with the bio mom.\n\nI read one of your replies to another comment, and you stated that the bio mom takes her kid's for haircuts; this is where the unspoken guideline was crossed. My theory (i might be completely wrong though, so dont take it at face value) is that salon trips are important to bio mom because it's guarenteed time that she gets to spend with her sons. But now that you've cut her son's hair, there's no reason to go to the salon. You've taken that moment away from her, and it also probably makes her feel inadequate since her kid would rather you give him a haircut instead of going to the salon with bio mom.\n\nObviously it was not your intention to make her feel insecure. I think the best thing to do is to be more communicative with bio mom. Try to help bio mom understand that it's alright for her kids to have a relationship with the both of you, and that any relationship they have with you won't take away from the relationship they have with her.", "NTA. The kid is the one that has to live with the hair, and he deserves to like how he looks and to have the haircut he wants. Aside from situations like baby\u2019s first haircut without parents\u2019 permission, or overbearing grandparents cutting a toddler\u2019s hair because *they* don\u2019t like the toddler\u2019s appearance, parents who freak out over haircuts are weird & need to get a grip.", "NTA.\n\nNot only did his Dad aprove, but you waited until his dad got home, which gave your step son extra time to think about it and change his mind.", "NTA his father has just as much right to give consent as she does.", "Ten is plenty old enough to want to make changes to one's appearance. It's just hair. It will grow back.\n\nWhat I wouldn't have given at 10 to be allowed to have short hair!\n\nNTA\n\nYou had the permission of the one who mattered, plus his dad.", "I\u2019m not sure calling you an asshole is right here but if my kid came back home with drastically changed looks, I would be upset no one told me.", "nta. she doesn\u2019t discuss haircut with y\u2019all so why should y\u2019all have to discuss them with her? you had your husband\u2019s permission, he even recorded it. if anything, your husband should have given bio mom a heads up.", "honestly who cares about this that much? as long as the kid\u2019s happy who gives a care. NTA.", "NTA. 10 years old is old enough to have an informed opinion on their haircut and he is the one who requested it unprompted. You checked with his father, who has every right to consent to a hair cut his child wanted. IDK what the mother's problem is, but it is a her problem.", "A 10 year old can pick out there own hair cut. NTA", "NTA. It would have been smart for your husband to give the boy's mom a heads up about the change however. That way it wouldn't have been such a shock to her, your husband could have controlled the messaging, and neither you nor the 10yo would be in the middle of the conflict.", "Ehhhhhh\nNTA though I do think the mom should have been involved. That is a drastic change and even though I think he\u2019s old enough to have it done it may have meant something special to the mom. Maybe she\u2019d want to be present when it was done too. I also agree on the impulsive thing. I don\u2019t have a problem with my kids wanting their hair a certain way even if it\u2019s not my preference but for something that big I might tell them they have to wait a few days before it\u2019s officially done so we can make SURE they want it. It\u2019s not my job to make my child my own dress up doll but it\u2019s my job to help guide them. I agree with a few others saying that it was the dads job to contact mom though.", "NTA. In mom's position, I would also have been pretty upset. But, hopefully once she thinks through it, she'll come to the conclusion that it's his hair, his choice. It will grow back if he decides he didn't like the change.", "NAH, IMO there are 3 people involved. Kid, bio mom, dad. Two of them voted to cut it so cutting was the correct answer. But I also feel for the mom, she clearly wanted the long hair and feels upset that it was cut.", "NTA, you got permission from Dad. Dad however is a bit of ta as he should have communicated this with Mom. Totally not against dad giving the okay seeing as Son is 10 but a heads up would have been appropriate here even if it was after the fact. \n\nDad can deal with Mom. She's not your problem. Thank you for being an awesome step parent.", "Its just hair and it will grow back. Its also his body ,his mom should respect that for something so minor. And dad(his parent) gave permission . She just wants to cause drama,dont engage.NTA.", "NTA his dad approved and he's the parent too", "As long as stepson was ok with it youre good", "I think it would be thoughtful to get permission from both parents before giving a kid a drastic haircut.  I have shared custody and I would be upset in this situation.  I also wouldn\u2019t do something like this without checking with my ex-husband.", "NTA. It\u2019s just hair. It will grow back.", "NTA but it is important to consider others feelings, yes. You can always acknowledge her hurt and tell her you understand her pov and apologize for such a drastic move.  That he wanted it done and got permission from dad and you didn't think of how it would impact mom. A little swallowed ego goes a long way in shared parenting. sometimes just acknowledging another's hurt feelings and genuine apology goes a long way in smoothing over problems.", "NTA\n\nHe's old enough to make his own decision about his hair. Also you had permission from his Dad.", "I guess this is unpopular but I think YTA. Or at least problematic. Getting a haircut without informing her is one thing but doing a buzz cut on shoulder length hair without at least telling mom shows a lack of respect for her as a parenting partner. A head\u2019s up would\u2019ve been ok. Even as a married person I wouldn\u2019t make a decision to seriously alter my kids appearance without giving my husband a heads up.", "NTA. You talked to the person you were supposed to which was dad. If any more communication was needed that should have been between dad and mom.  \n\nThey share custody and I'm sure mom doesn't run haircuts by dad.  This is what the son wanted and dad gave go ahead. If mom is mad then she needs to talk that out with dad but 10 is old enough to decide how you want you hair", "Info - is there any important cultural significance to the kid having long hair?", "NTA. It's hair. It'll grow back in 2 weeks", "Ehhhhh, I\u2019m gonna say like NAH ish. You said that if your son had done that that you would be upset, so surely you can kind of empathize. Maybe she\u2019s insecure because haircuts are her thing and she doesn\u2019t want that taken away? I do think a heads up would have been more appropriate, 10 is old enough to cut hair how they want it but as someone who gets emotional about hair cuts, I think she could have used a warning.", "[deleted]", "YTA\nThat should have been a discussion between his parents, before the haircut. But DH owns this as well, since he gave you the green light, without discussing it with the mother.", "Y t a, if the mom discusses all haircuts with dad first. However if she doesn\u2019t then n t a. If mom is allowed to make calls why cant the dad. You had his permission. Your husband should have at least informed his ex that one of their sons got a haircut.", "Slight YTA (your husband more so) for not giving mom a heads up about what the kid wanted. Yes, he is old enough at 10 to make decisions about his hair assuming his parents agree that they allow kids to make their own hair decisions. A heads up removes all of the potential drama though and if the standard has been that your stepkids are taken into a salon or barber for haircuts then that should have happened as well as either mom or dad could have taken him in.", "NAH. While i don\u2019t personally think it\u2019s the end of the world because hair does grow back and you certainly didn\u2019t do anything with malicious intent, if you would have been upset if you were in her shoes then I would take this as a lesson that you probably should have messaged her first too and definitely should do that the next time.", "YTA for doing it without a discussion or heads up. It doesn\u2019t matter that your husband gave his okay because your stepson has two parents and you\u2019re not one of them", "Slight YTA but only because you and your husband didn\u2019t have him call his mom first and say what was going to happen. 10 is well old enough to decide how he wants his hair. He doesn\u2019t need his mom to decide for him, a phone call telling her that he was cutting it all off would have been much better than just picking him up from school and seeing a huge change.", "YTA - you and your husband. \n\nYou don't have joint custody. Your husband has joint custody with his ex. The discussion shouldn't have been between you and him, but him and his ex.  That you know you wouldn't like it if one of your son's came home with a radically different haircut makes this even worse. You KNOW you wouldn't want to be in her shoes but were unable to apply that here.", "NAH ~ being the step mom in your shoes, you weren't wrong but a heads up to her from you or a call from son before it happened would've stopped her from feeling the way she did.", "YTA. FYI...your HUSBAND has joint custody. Not you. You KNOW his mother takes him to a professional. You gave her ZERO heads up let alone actually asking her. If there's ever any court visits be prepared for that to be an added line.", "YTA, it wasn't just your husbands call to make. A quick call to the kids mom should've  been made.", "I'll get voted down for this but YTA.  OP's husband should have at least had a conversation with his ex-wife.  He's an AH too.\n\nETA: 50/50 custody means both parents have a say in major decisions. I would argue that a 10-year-old's decision to shave his head is a major decision that both parents should weigh in on.  I am a divorced dad, and I would not have made such a decision without my ex-wife's input. And I'd be furious if she did it without mine.", "Yes YTA. Your husband and his ex have 50-50 custody. Not you, your husband and his ex. If you didn\u2019t want drama you should have stayed out of it.", "YTA. This was way beyond your role. You are not the parent to this child and his MOTHER should have been involved.", "YTA but you can use this as a good opportunity to learn. You've expressed regret and critical thinking on this issue. Reach out to the mom and apologise and convey your conclusion that you would have been upset too. Try and use this to build a bridge with her. I think it's great you've reflected on this and are open to input. Good luck!", "Mild YTA.  This is not the way to effectively co-parent.  You'd have been in a much better place if you'd just given her a heads up.  Listen to that nagging voice.  It will steer you far better than Reddit on St. Patrick's Day.", "NAH but you should have talked to her if she\u2019s usually in charge of doing that", "Sort of an Asshole. You explain why in your last few paragraphs. You hurt his Mother\u2019s feelings. It may of been awkward to do so, but, I would of reached out to her first.", "YTA.  Good on you for having empathy for the ex.", "ESH, you can't possibly believe that she wouldn't have wanted to at least know about it before he was dropped off!", "YTA as is your husband. He should have checked in with bio-mom beforehand.", "Are you serious?

I guess I could but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be a supportive mother if I did. His body, his hair, his personality. Sounds like your kids bio mom was trying to control him too long.

She got a bit cranky about me doing her hair and got in a bad habit of sucking on it. My husband had enough of her hair becoming a wet mop and decided to get her haircut. However, I was still holding out hope it was a phase and she\u2019d get back to letting me do her hair. So, yes, he *could* have taken her to get a haircut and come home with a bob, but he understood that I had a bigger emotional attachment to her hair than he he had to cutting it. Ultimately, we did cut it, but in my time and when I was ready. Does that make sense?", "NTA it'll grow back", "NTA, \n\nAlso, how long did he have to wait for dad to get home to officially get the cut? I\u2019m speculating dad was at work or gonna be gone for a good while otherwise you would have just had your stepson wait till he got home to ask in the first place. So there was no impulse to it by the time the actual cut happened if it\u2019s in a time frame similar to what I\u2019m picturing. Even if it was 1-2 hours he had to wait that was still plenty of time for him to have changed his mind had it truly been on impulse. \n\nAs a mom of almost 10 yr old this is the age they are starting to experiment with their style. My son has decided he likes short hair because he can\u2019t stand hair to touch his face. He still says he\u2019s going to let it grow out sometimes then he starts complaining he can\u2019t stand the feel of it touching him. Letting them experiment with their hair helps them in their journey to finding what they like. My son has been choosing his own hair style since he was 5. He has also had his hair dyed red, green, and purple on impulse because I was dying mine.\n\nKeep staying out of the drama. Your husband should have msg the child\u2019s mom.

To absolutely nobody's surprise (save my step-mother) my hair would be tangled at the end of the day...when she'd decide to run her fingers through it to see if I brushed it. Keep in mind...my hair is wavy...2b borderline 2c and it's thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick....so tangling was it's most favorite thing ever! \n\nShe took us kids to get our hair tidied up before school began...her son was getting a buzzcut, her daughter, my sister and myself all a trim. My father and mother explicitly told her that my and my sister's hair was only to be ***trimmed***. My hair was done last...step-sis and sis both had trims done. My hair...the stylist wet it down and started combing through it...then turned to discuss something with my step-mother...next thing I knew I felt ***a lot*** of hair fall and heard my sister go \"what are you doing?! It's only supposed to be a trim not cut short!\"\n\n... The stylist stopped and asked what was going on. My sister insisted it was supposed to be a trim, my step-mother insisted I wanted it short, the stylist asked me what I wanted...I told the stylist it was only supposed to be a trim like my sister's. My step-mother was finally like \"Yeah it was but she doesn't take care of it so it needs to be short because I'm the one that takes care of her hair.\" ...I was crying at this point and the stylist apologized because they had to go through with the short hair cut. ...I couldn't even put it in a ponytail afterwards.\n\nFirst and only time my father ever yelled at my step-mother and actually defended my sister and I.
