It would have been real weird for you to call his mom and ask after his dad already said to go ahead.", "NTA. Your stepson asked you to give him a buzzcut and you asked him if he was sure and got confirmation from his dad. It sounds like your stepson was very happy with the result and that should be the most important thing. It's understandable that his mom was upset, but it's not like you made the decision without consulting anyone. You also didn't feed into any drama, which is always a good thing.", "NTA - age 10 is old enough to decide for himself that he wants short hair.  It will grow back.  Only if there had been any pressure, subtle bribes, or subtle punishments would I think the mom had a case.", "NTA. Father approved. Unless they communicate and agree on every haircut or hairstyle, dad has a right just like mother does seeing as how it\u2019s 50/50. Went through this with my step kids.", "You got the dad\u2019s permission. You didn\u2019t make the decision yourself. Dad has equal custody and just as much right to make that decision.

You asked him if he was sure and he said yeah.\n\nYou did nothing wrong", "NTA.  Dad said it was OK, and even filmed it.\n\nBUT:  I have this crazy image in my head from this line: \"I shouldn't have allowed him to do it implosively\". :)", "NTA, the kid wanted his hair cut.  Communication with his mom is on your husband, not you.  I could see being a little taken aback as a mom and picking my kid with a drastically different hair style with no warning, but not something that should be shoved back at you. Her beef is with her ex, not you.  \n\nYour husband could have warned her that their son was getting a cut, but ultimately it\u2019s what the kid wanted.  His hair his choice. A hair cut isn\u2019t permanent, and if the kid regrets it later, it will eventually grow back.", "NTA\n\n1. It\u2019s your husbands responsibility to communicate with his ex about it after you told him, and before him telling you to go ahead\n\n2. If your stepson really wants a buzzcut, his mum should probably let him try it", "NTA. 10 years old is old enough to decide on a haircut.  Dad's permission is sufficient.  \n\nDoes everyone voting Y T A think if mom said no, the kid shouldn't be allowed to cut his hair?  How old does he need to be before he can choose his haircut without needing permission from both parents?  Ludicrous.", "NTA it's only hair, he's old enough to choose for himself, the dad had no problem. I'll bet no one in a nuclear family is forced to receive the blessing of both parents separately before changing their hair, one parent takes them to the hairdresser and that's that. This woman is being a drama llama.", "NTA! \n\nYou discussed it w/ one parent. Dad should\u2019ve relayed the message. Obviously step son wasn\u2019t happy w his appearance & wanted a change lol", "NTA.  In a scenario like this of split custody, each parent has authority over the child when the child is over, and defers to the other parent when the child is there.  Optimally the ex-spouses must coordinate on big things (choice of school kind of things) but ... a haircut?  Nah.\n\nNote also that as stepmother, you and husband have to decide how active a role in parenting you're to take.  Sounds like in this case you're very active and involved, so great!\n\nTo recap...  don't worry.  Lots of boys want to shave their heads at one point or another.  It'll grow back.", "NTA.....At 10 he is old enough to make his own decision", "NTA\n\nThis one is on your husband.", "NTA. You did ask his dad, why would you ask his Mom, too? I don\u2019t know, if the kid wanted it and one parent said ok, I don\u2019t see a problem. Kid will probably have lots of hairstyles Mom will hate.\n \u2026..and do we not allow 10 year olds to dictate their own hairstyles in 2023? If the kid said shave it, why is there even an argument?", "It's his body and hair. He asked for it, and his father was there.\n\nThe mother is just looking for something to complain about. \n\nNTA even more so for not responding to her drama. \n\nShe obviously doesn't understand that her son's happiness comes first.", "NTA. It\u2019s great that your stepson was included and got what he wanted. Mom has some right to be able to veto appearance changes, but that should be less and less every year. \n\nShe probably deserves a courtesy apology from you or dad, and some sort of \u201cnext time do this\u201d agreement.", "You got permission from dad. He shares custody. He gets to make medical decisions too. A haircut is not chopping off his leg. YNTA", "NTA.  He specifically asked you to cut his hair.  At his age he's definitely old enough to start making decisions about his own appearance.  Your husband also approved it.  Haircut's also aren't permanent.  Depending on everyone's relationship dynamic I do think either you or your husband should have reached out to her to at least let her know it was happening, or even initiated an actual discussion about it before making the decision.", "NTA - a 10-year-old should be able to make their own decision on a haircut. It isn\u2019t permanent, and unless his mom checks with his dad before every cut, then the dad was well within his rights to agree with his son\u2019s request. \n\nIf this was a toddler, I could understand both parents wanting to have a say. But this is a 10-year-old and his 50% custodial parent said yes.", "NTA  Son requested. Dad gave permission. It was a standard haircut.  Nothing crazy, no hair dye or chemicals used. It doesn\u2019t sound like there were any cultural/religious reasons for this to be a problem.  If Dad had taken him to the barbershop instead it sounds like the outcome would be the same.  It will grow back, and a 10 year old is old enough to make reasonable decisions about his appearance.  It sounds like Mom was the only one who had an issue - which may or may not have anything to do with his choosing to cut his hair short.", "NTA. Kid asked you to do it, father consented and participated during his own time. Her beef is with her ex husband's parenting deciding, not with you.  She's just making drama because it's easy to be mad at you.", "It doesn't matter what any parents thinks of a child's hair, honestly. If they want it, they should  get it! Especially when it's just a simple cut that doesn't require any extra maintenance. Why would it be a problem for a kid to explore and express themselves how they want to? Sounds like his mom has some serious control issues, or she doesn't want her kids to have individuality. I'm glad that he mentioned wanting a haircut to you and not to her, as he might have had his hopes crushed. NTA at all!", "NTA. You asked the kids dad, he agreed. The kid also agreed. It's your husbands job to check with his ex, if he doesn't know if she would agree.", "NTA - and this isn't about the haircut.  This is about you being part of a decision that she wasn't part of, while normalizing the fact that she feels like she has absolute control over her son's body to justify her position to make you the problem.", "NTA \n\nit's the kid's head. Neither one of you own the hair and you even waited until the kid's father was home before doing it so it's not like you threw the kid to the ground and forced a hair cut on him.\n\nYou be as implosive as you want.", "nta kid is old enough to decide on his own and you asked his father who has 50/50 custody.. you didn\u2019t force him so mom just needs to let this one go", "NTA. Ten year olds are old enough to choose their own hairstyle. The fact that she messaged you about it after calling his father says a lot. Send her the video.", "I have a feeling she mostly was mad because she felt \"left out\"", "NTA. Let\u2019s face it, Mum\u2019s issue is with you and not the haircut.", "NTA.  He's old enough to make this kind of decision on his own. It's just hair and not permanent.  It's not like he was the 4 or 5 year old. His mommy needs to let him grow up a little.", " NTA. Dad was there, kid wanted it, no worries. My motto with all my kids has always been your hair, you business, even if I don\u2019t like it. I always told them, you want a green Mohawk?  Bows the time, it a hell of a lot harder to have that at 30 than at 16. It\u2019s just hair, it grows back.", "NTA, \n\nBUT\n\nI do think y'all should have at least said something to her. My ex buzzed our son's long beautiful hair and for good reason (he is autistic and took to pulling it out in frustration) but I would've liked a heads up. I arrived to pick my son up at my mom's and I was taken aback. I guess I wanted to be in the know and the surprise was a lot. Apparently I did not hide my feelings about it, as they were plastered all over my face.\n\nYour stepson is old enough to decipher his hair and his dad gave the ok, so you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou had permission from both the person whose hair was being cut and from their legal guardian.  If mom needed to be looped in, that was on dad not OP.\n\nYou also did right by not responding.  She had no right to come at you, she needs to discuss any issues she has with her coparent.\n\nMy oldest always did a wild thing in the summer with his hair when he was a kid.  Buzz cut one year, mohawk another, dyed red another, etc.  So both my ex and I were used to him getting returned with a radically different hair style than they dropped him off with depending on who had him at the time of his hair cut.  Was never a big deal and we had fun with it.\n\nCurrently he is 19 and with long white hair year round.  Looks like he could have stepped out of an anime", "NTA. You asked his dad and he agreed. It was on him to notify his sons mother not yours.", "NTA, though your husband could have given a heads up to the mother", "As a \"step\" parent myself if we want to do something big I give mom a heads up out of courtesy. We have a very good relationship though. NTA either way because dad gave permission.", "I'm going with NTA because he is 10, my children have always decided how they want their hair! At 10 he's old enough to make a decision, I too would be upset with a drastically different change on my child so she does have a right to be upset maybe a text letting her know would have been good! But overall he had a parents permission and wanted it sooooo as long as he's happy that SHOULD be all the matters", "NTA, good move on ignoring the mother.  Don\u2019t feed the beast.\nGood luck, I\u2019m sure some conversations will need to happen.  But the kid is old enough and dad/you don\u2019t need her permission to cut his hair (the way he wanted!)", "NTA \n\nYou checked with his dad and got the green light. Also, your step son requested it and he's old enough to have a day in his appearance. And it's not a permanent change. \n\nThose 3 things are enough to make me vote NTA. But I also appreciate that you stepped back and tried to see it from the moms perspective. Maybe in a few days when things cal. down a little, you could approach her and have a short conversation. Acknowledged that you weren't trying to upset her and you thought getting his dad's permission was enough. Let her know that you wouldn't do anything serious or permanent without talking to her. I don't think you absolutely have to do this,  but it might help co parenting go more smoothly going forward.", "You're not an A, but I will say it was inconsiderate to not talk with the bio mom.\n\nI read one of your replies to another comment, and you stated that the bio mom takes her kid's for haircuts; this is where the unspoken guideline was crossed. My theory (i might be completely wrong though, so dont take it at face value) is that salon trips are important to bio mom because it's guarenteed time that she gets to spend with her sons. But now that you've cut her son's hair, there's no reason to go to the salon. You've taken that moment away from her, and it also probably makes her feel inadequate since her kid would rather you give him a haircut instead of going to the salon with bio mom.\n\nObviously it was not your intention to make her feel insecure. I think the best thing to do is to be more communicative with bio mom. Try to help bio mom understand that it's alright for her kids to have a relationship with the both of you, and that any relationship they have with you won't take away from the relationship they have with her.", "NTA. The kid is the one that has to live with the hair, and he deserves to like how he looks and to have the haircut he wants. Aside from situations like baby\u2019s first haircut without parents\u2019 permission, or overbearing grandparents cutting a toddler\u2019s hair because *they* don\u2019t like the toddler\u2019s appearance, parents who freak out over haircuts are weird & need to get a grip.", "NTA.\n\nNot only did his Dad aprove, but you waited until his dad got home, which gave your step son extra time to think about it and change his mind.", "NTA his father has just as much right to give consent as she does.", "Ten is plenty old enough to want to make changes to one's appearance. It's just hair. It will grow back.\n\nWhat I wouldn't have given at 10 to be allowed to have short hair!\n\nNTA\n\nYou had the permission of the one who mattered, plus his dad.", "I\u2019m not sure calling you an asshole is right here but if my kid came back home with drastically changed looks, I would be upset no one told me.", "nta. she doesn\u2019t discuss haircut with y\u2019all so why should y\u2019all have to discuss them with her? you had your husband\u2019s permission, he even recorded it. if anything, your husband should have given bio mom a heads up.", "honestly who cares about this that much? as long as the kid\u2019s happy who gives a care. NTA.", "NTA. 10 years old is old enough to have an informed opinion on their haircut and he is the one who requested it unprompted. You checked with his father, who has every right to consent to a hair cut his child wanted. IDK what the mother's problem is, but it is a her problem.", "A 10 year old can pick out there own hair cut. NTA", "NTA. It would have been smart for your husband to give the boy's mom a heads up about the change however. That way it wouldn't have been such a shock to her, your husband could have controlled the messaging, and neither you nor the 10yo would be in the middle of the conflict.", "Ehhhhhh\nNTA though I do think the mom should have been involved. That is a drastic change and even though I think he\u2019s old enough to have it done it may have meant something special to the mom. Maybe she\u2019d want to be present when it was done too. I also agree on the impulsive thing. I don\u2019t have a problem with my kids wanting their hair a certain way even if it\u2019s not my preference but for something that big I might tell them they have to wait a few days before it\u2019s officially done so we can make SURE they want it. It\u2019s not my job to make my child my own dress up doll but it\u2019s my job to help guide them. I agree with a few others saying that it was the dads job to contact mom though.", "NTA. In mom's position, I would also have been pretty upset. But, hopefully once she thinks through it, she'll come to the conclusion that it's his hair, his choice. It will grow back if he decides he didn't like the change.", "NAH, IMO there are 3 people involved. Kid, bio mom, dad. Two of them voted to cut it so cutting was the correct answer. But I also feel for the mom, she clearly wanted the long hair and feels upset that it was cut.", "NTA, you got permission from Dad. Dad however is a bit of ta as he should have communicated this with Mom. Totally not against dad giving the okay seeing as Son is 10 but a heads up would have been appropriate here even if it was after the fact. \n\nDad can deal with Mom. She's not your problem. Thank you for being an awesome step parent.", "Its just hair and it will grow back. Its also his body ,his mom should respect that for something so minor. And dad(his parent) gave permission . She just wants to cause drama,dont engage.NTA.", "NTA his dad approved and he's the parent too", "As long as stepson was ok with it youre good", "I think it would be thoughtful to get permission from both parents before giving a kid a drastic haircut.  I have shared custody and I would be upset in this situation.  I also wouldn\u2019t do something like this without checking with my ex-husband.", "NTA. It\u2019s just hair. It will grow back.", "NTA but it is important to consider others feelings, yes. You can always acknowledge her hurt and tell her you understand her pov and apologize for such a drastic move.  That he wanted it done and got permission from dad and you didn't think of how it would impact mom. A little swallowed ego goes a long way in shared parenting. sometimes just acknowledging another's hurt feelings and genuine apology goes a long way in smoothing over problems.", "NTA\n\nHe's old enough to make his own decision about his hair. Also you had permission from his Dad.", "I guess this is unpopular but I think YTA. Or at least problematic. Getting a haircut without informing her is one thing but doing a buzz cut on shoulder length hair without at least telling mom shows a lack of respect for her as a parenting partner. A head\u2019s up would\u2019ve been ok. Even as a married person I wouldn\u2019t make a decision to seriously alter my kids appearance without giving my husband a heads up.", "NTA. You talked to the person you were supposed to which was dad. If any more communication was needed that should have been between dad and mom.  \n\nThey share custody and I'm sure mom doesn't run haircuts by dad.  This is what the son wanted and dad gave go ahead. If mom is mad then she needs to talk that out with dad but 10 is old enough to decide how you want you hair", "Info - is there any important cultural significance to the kid having long hair?", "NTA. It's hair. It'll grow back in 2 weeks", "Ehhhhh, I\u2019m gonna say like NAH ish. You said that if your son had done that that you would be upset, so surely you can kind of empathize. Maybe she\u2019s insecure because haircuts are her thing and she doesn\u2019t want that taken away? I do think a heads up would have been more appropriate, 10 is old enough to cut hair how they want it but as someone who gets emotional about hair cuts, I think she could have used a warning.", "Yes, it's not cool to change the appearance of a child without notifying their other parent especially considering 50/50 custody. A good rule is if it is something the child can change in 5 minutes cool if not probably don't do it, particularly if it's something spur of the moment", "YTA\nThat should have been a discussion between his parents, before the haircut. But DH owns this as well, since he gave you the green light, without discussing it with the mother.", "Y t a, if the mom discusses all haircuts with dad first. However if she doesn\u2019t then n t a. If mom is allowed to make calls why cant the dad. You had his permission. Your husband should have at least informed his ex that one of their sons got a haircut.", "Slight YTA (your husband more so) for not giving mom a heads up about what the kid wanted. Yes, he is old enough at 10 to make decisions about his hair assuming his parents agree that they allow kids to make their own hair decisions. A heads up removes all of the potential drama though and if the standard has been that your stepkids are taken into a salon or barber for haircuts then that should have happened as well as either mom or dad could have taken him in.", "NAH. While i don\u2019t personally think it\u2019s the end of the world because hair does grow back and you certainly didn\u2019t do anything with malicious intent, if you would have been upset if you were in her shoes then I would take this as a lesson that you probably should have messaged her first too and definitely should do that the next time.", "YTA for doing it without a discussion or heads up. It doesn\u2019t matter that your husband gave his okay because your stepson has two parents and you\u2019re not one of them", "Slight YTA but only because you and your husband didn\u2019t have him call his mom first and say what was going to happen. 10 is well old enough to decide how he wants his hair. He doesn\u2019t need his mom to decide for him, a phone call telling her that he was cutting it all off would have been much better than just picking him up from school and seeing a huge change.", "YTA - you and your husband. \n\nYou don't have joint custody. Your husband has joint custody with his ex. The discussion shouldn't have been between you and him, but him and his ex.  That you know you wouldn't like it if one of your son's came home with a radically different haircut makes this even worse. You KNOW you wouldn't want to be in her shoes but were unable to apply that here.", "NAH ~ being the step mom in your shoes, you weren't wrong but a heads up to her from you or a call from son before it happened would've stopped her from feeling the way she did.", "YTA. FYI...your HUSBAND has joint custody. Not you. You KNOW his mother takes him to a professional. You gave her ZERO heads up let alone actually asking her. If there's ever any court visits be prepared for that to be an added line.", "YTA, it wasn't just your husbands call to make. A quick call to the kids mom should've  been made.", "I'll get voted down for this but YTA.  OP's husband should have at least had a conversation with his ex-wife.  He's an AH too.", "Yes YTA. Your husband and his ex have 50-50 custody. Not you, your husband and his ex. If you didn\u2019t want drama you should have stayed out of it.", "YTA. This was way beyond your role. You are not the parent to this child and his MOTHER should have been involved.", "YTA but you can use this as a good opportunity to learn. You've expressed regret and critical thinking on this issue. Reach out to the mom and apologise and convey your conclusion that you would have been upset too. Try and use this to build a bridge with her. I think it's great you've reflected on this and are open to input. Good luck!", "Mild YTA.  This is not the way to effectively co-parent.  You'd have been in a much better place if you'd just given her a heads up.  Listen to that nagging voice.  It will steer you far better than Reddit on St. Patrick's Day.", "NAH but you should have talked to her if she\u2019s usually in charge of doing that", "Sort of an Asshole. You explain why in your last few paragraphs. You hurt his Mother\u2019s feelings. It may of been awkward to do so, but, I would of reached out to her first.", "YTA.  Good on you for having empathy for the ex.", "ESH, you can't possibly believe that she wouldn't have wanted to at least know about it before he was dropped off!", "YTA as is your husband. He should have checked in with bio-mom beforehand.", "Are you serious?

Over a decade later his mother STILL was bitching about it.", "NTA because you got your husband's permission BUT. \"*If my son had a stepmom and came home from their house with a drastically different haircut I think I might of been upset too and possibly think that person crossed an unspoken boundary.*\" \n\nCo-parenting is difficult which means you all need to work harder at it and address each situation without creating a situation where one parent feels glossed over. Sending a message stating his son wanted and was getting his hair cut shorter might have greatly reduced the animosity.", "NTA. 10 is plenty old enough for a child to decide what haircut they want. You even got permission from the boy\u2019s father and waited for him to get home, which gave him plenty of time to change his mind about the cut.\n\nTo the people calling you the AH for not giving the bio mom a warning or asking her permission: that\u2019s not really OP\u2019s job as the stepmom. It\u2019s not *her* ex wife. If anyone should have done that, it would be the father.", "NTA, Since when did a haircut need permission from both divorced parents? The only reason she's mad is because it went from long (which I think she preferred) to short. She needs to learn she can't control everything in her son's life while sharing custody.", "NTA. The kid asked you for the haircut, you got permission from the dad. If she has a problem with it, she needs to speak to his father...not you.", "NTA\n\nThe only thing you did wrong was to not tell her to take it up with the parent who had approved it. She wouldn't be yelling at the stylist.if he had taken his son to get his hair cut.", "NTA dad is just as much parent as mom is. 10 year olds are old enough to decide if they want their hair cut or not. Also, it sounds like you have tons of experience cutting hair, it\u2019s not like you forced him into getting a terrible hair cut. Even if it wasn\u2019t a great haircut or if he didn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s just hair. It grows back.   Also, not giving in when she baited you, makes you the bigger person here. It was inappropriate of her to contact you, she should have gone through your husband. I wonder if she\u2019d be upset if your husband took him to a barber. LOL I\u2019m sure the custody agreement doesn\u2019t specify needing permission for a haircut.", "NTA\nYou got dad's permission. You even let him think about it for a few hours before you did it to make sure. If mom needed to be consulted (per custody agreement), that was dad's job. The kid is old enough to make his own hair choices. Makes me wonder if mom likes the long hair and kid has been begging for a short cut for a while?", "NTA, the kid came to you and Dad gave the OK. I'm guessing Mum likes his hair long despite him wanting it short and would never let him. I had a 90s bowl cut because of reasons like this for far too long (\"because it was popular\" my mother still argues to this day, despite me and my brother being the only kids in  a very large primary school with that haor style).", "You are the asshole. He has 2 parents who should have had a say.", "[deleted]", "Totally agree with your assessment. \n\nIt's just hair. It grows back. OP didn't act without permission from the other parent. It's a fuckin buzz cut.", "True! Also, I\u2019ve noticed that some moms with only sons will often encourage/pressure one of them to grow their hair long so they can get the experience of it with one child \n\nNTA", "Yeah that\u2019s pretty much what I was thinking too. Even if the ex wife should have been notified, that would have been dad\u2019s job not OP\u2019s. OP more than did her part when she asked dad if it was okay after the son. \n\nAlso it almost seems like the son maybe knew that mom wouldn\u2019t approve of the buzz cut, so he unfortunately had to find a way around that obstacle.", "I would agree if the ExWife and just vented to OP\u2019s husband about the disagreement. But instead the Ex didn\u2019t get enough satisfaction going after OP\u2019s husband and had a go at OP. That makes the Ex an AH and OP NTA.", "Yeah I think OP knows it, too. I\u2019m a stepparent and have bio kids, and I don\u2019t think she technically did wrong, but would probably be worth a heads up in the future, before any drastic changes.", "If you guys want a foundation of trust you and dad should\u2019ve known better and at least given her a heads up. What you did maybe isn\u2019t wrong but the end result is predictable.", "no", "Shoulder length hair won\u2019t grow back in 2 weeks. The 10 yr old should decide what hair cuts he wants.", "Exactly. This is why some people have literally added in their custody arrangement that there are no modifications to appearance by the other party without agreement.", "Only if the mom discusses all haircuts with the dad before the kids get them. If she doesn\u2019t then why should the dad.", "She does not. However, haircuts have always been somethings she's done.", "I knew there was a problem as soon as I saw \"we\" have joint custody. You do not. Your husband and his ex-wife do. YTA, a little bit, but your husband is a slightly bigger one.", ">The discussion shouldn't have been between you and him, but him and his ex.\n\nIt didn't need to be. 10 is plenty old enough to make your own decisions about your hair without needing your parent's permission. At ten, mommy doesn't get to control his bodily autonomy and decide when/what to do with his hair. If he wants to cut it and someone is able to, it gets cut.", "Yeah but who\u2019s responsibility is it to ask the mom? The Dad or the son not the stepmom. So she said to ask Dad and Dad didn\u2019t think mom needed to respond.", "Why is the father not able to make that call?", "The 10 year old can make his own decision", "So ex wife doesn\u2019t have to discuss haircuts with him but he has to with her?", "Re-read it. Kid requested her to cut it. OP checked with bio dad, bio dad okayed and approved it. It was not OPs responsibility to check with the bio mom, that would have been up to bio dad. Even then, a 10 year old is mature enough to pick their own damned hair cut.", "Why should his mother have been involved? It's not like it's a major milestone-he's had dozens of haircuts before and he'll have hundreds of haircuts after this. At 10, she gets limited say in his bodily autonomy. A temporary change to his hair is well within his boundaries to decide himself without needing mommy's permission.", "I have to chuckle at your comment.\n\nIn what world is OP the AH?\n\n1/ She asked her husband (the kid's dad). It's his job to inform the mom, not OP's.\n\n2/ the stepson wants the haircut. A 10 years old kid should be able to get the haircut he wants, as long as it's not something horrendous.\n\nOP is NTA.", "it\u2019s the DAD\u2019S job to discuss anything child related with his ex wife, not op\u2019s \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And that her responsibility how? Not her place to find out if he checked with overbearing mommy who just wants drama.", "Is the father who approved this haircut any less a parent than the mother? \n\nIf he had been the one to cut his hair and she recorded it, would this be your judgement? \n\nNowhere did she decide to do it without consulting her husband, his other parent. \nMom is completely ignoring her own kids request and the permission given by the other 50/50 parent entirely to take out frustrations on the stepmom. It's unnecessary. \n\nOp could choose to apologize if they want to try to mend the relationship to the mom, but that's up to them.", "Pretty sad that you think Mommy is the only one that sets to makes decisions and fathers aren't allowed to. And apparently you don't think the child is allowed to make their own decisions.  Please never have kids.", "SM asked for permission. The dad said yeah. I'm pretty sure a father holds similar power to make a decision for his son", "By the time a kid is 10, they should have a huge say in how their hair is cut/styled.", "Not understanding because he was the one who requested the haircut", "OP says the step son with the hair is the one who asked for the hair cut in the first place, in the post.", "Read the story before you comment", "She did, she asked him first if he was sure and he confirmed it, then she talked to the dad.", "I mean, the stepson is the one who asked her to do it, and she said he was happy with the result.", "Is this a strange, roundabout way of saying she went through the right steps before shaving the kid's hair?", "I hear you, but next time maybe read the post before commenting.", "Wow, way to be illiterate", "I had a similar situation. My GF painted my daughters fingernails, i agreed. My ex wasn't happy.\nOf course this was my problem, and not my girlfriends.", "even if a heads up is warranted, that is on the dad not OP.  OP had permission both from the person whose hair was being cut and their legal guardian.

That's hyperbole", "I have 3 stepson , I use the 2 yes 1 no rule, so I don't overstep the boys know this helps everything  run smoothly.", "Yeah I've seen this too many times (doing hair for years)... most of the time it's the alternate household that decides to do things without consulting the parent that usually handles it. And it's always drama. Too many times those people will literally have discussions about how the other parent won't like it and oh well they'll get over it. They KNOW the other parent. We don't. Odds are very high they knew mom wouldn't be happy...hence not calling her.", "It's not just his kid, though. And some parents are very particular about their kids' hair cuts. especially if they pay for it to be done professionally. A quick call probably would've saved a lot of trouble.", "I read it the first time. They should have consulted with his mother. If stepmom did not want drama she shouldn\u2019t have cut the hair. 10 is a child, no not really mature enough", "Chuckling at your reply!\n\nIf you read my response to OP, I explain why I think she's the AH. I also acknowledge her reflective thinking.", "Well I couldn't do E.S.H. because that would include mom. \n\nWhy do you think mom is overbearing and \"wants drama\"? That is a bit of a stretch with the information given. It seems perfectly reasonable to want both parents input on a radical hair change. Mostly this is on the actual parent (OP's husband).", "How do you know mom is ignoring the request? Sounds like a spur of the moment idea by the 10yo.\n\nIt's a 50/50 co-parenting situation. Who cut/ who videoed is not important. The co-parenting is a huge deal. It could have led to court orders, et al.\n\nI stand by my original comment. Both parents should be consulted. It wasn't a trim... they shaved his head!", "She said BOTH parents should have agreed to such a drastic haircut.", "Troll. I have kids. They are wonderful men. Get off your high horse and read the OP post. If it were the other way around, dad has every right to be pissed off.

I kinda get a hair cut because although hair grows back, it takes a while. \n\nBut nail polish can be cleaned off fairly easily if needed. The only reason why people may be opposed to it is if the kid is like really young (like preschool aged or something).", "YES 100% yes. I always assume communication is between bio parents.

She\u2019s NTA at all.", "I don\u2019t disagree with that, although I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s a strong case of asshole behavior if we do go with that ruling. On a scale of 1-10, this is a 1.5 in severity in my mind. Not quite nothing, but it shouldn\u2019t be much more than mild annoyance. \n\nThat said, would the mom need to get the dads permission? If not, then it\u2019s a strong NTA, imo.", "Nothing OP did was wrong. OP talked to the kids biological parent and got the okay from him. Moms are not the sole decision maker for their children.

That should always work both ways \n\nI would also agree that it's not a big mistake. Def a soft YTA. Although I have known some people to be real particular about it. I don't personally think it's a big deal. My parents luckily never had an issue with me changing my hair. Kids can experiment with their hair, too."]}
