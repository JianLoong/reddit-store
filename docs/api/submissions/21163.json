I\u2019ve always been into beauty routines and rituals & I\u2019ve definitely influenced Violet over the last few years. We have a weekly mini girls night every week together.\n\nOn Thursday, I was wasting time on TikTok and my bathroom popped up on my front page, showing and discussing my skincare products. I opened the account and it was Violet (she does not show her face in any of these videos), going through all of my products and talking about what she thought of them, presenting it as if it were her personal routine, testing serums on her wrist to show the consistency, talking about ingredients. There are different videos showing my shower, under my sink, in my drawers, etc and talking about my hair stuff, lotions, perfume, makeup, everything in depth. There was even one from the kitchen discussing my vitamins. \n\nI was very uncomfortable and felt like my privacy had been invaded. I showed James when he got home, before I talked to Violet. He doesn\u2019t understand - Violet doesn\u2019t show her own face, let alone mine or use our names or even really use the products so he doesn\u2019t see the issue. And I understand why he thinks that because it is very logical but I still *feel* weirdly violated. I want Violet to delete the videos and to no longer have free access to our bedroom and bathroom (she is currently able to go in and grab shampoo if she\u2019s out or cotton balls or whatever. I want a lock on our bedroom so that she would have to ask every time). James feels like this is a silly overreaction and that she is just a kid messing around. I told him that it was a weird thing to do, why is a 15 year old girl pretending to review retinol cream? And now he is still irritated with me for calling Violet \"weird\" even when I called him out for deliberately misunderstanding me and he knew damn well that's not what I said.\n\nI tried to bring it up with Violet myself but she is just refusing to acknowledge that the account is hers at all so without James backing me, I don\u2019t know what to do with that. I was venting to my sisters and one of them got how I feel completely but my older sister told me I\u2019m making a mountain out of a molehill and just to let it go. I still feel like I have the right to feel how I feel so I want to ask objective people\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1688315748, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14osoge/aita_for_being_uncomfortable_with_my_stepdaughter/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a right to your privacy. Seems like for you your bathroom is a private space and it's fine to not want it on TikTok.", "NTA - You're not weird for feeling violated.  Your private space was invaded and put online.  You don't know who views her videos and if they are people you know.  Obviously anyone that knows you would recognize your house and her voice.  A woman's skincare regimen is a very personal, private thing.  More to the point, she didn't ask your permission before making these videos.\n\nYou certainly should start locking your bedroom door and I'd also suggest that you take away her phone until she confesses and deletes the videos in front of you.", "NTA y'all need to establish clear boundaries. My kids can only go in our room if we're in there and only use our restroom if they ask first and that's because I have shit in my life that isn't for kids. There have been times where they've asked, I had to think about what was out on the counter, and emphatically said NO. \n\nSweet Jesus, if my children opened up my bathroom drawers we'd all be so traumatized \ud83e\udee0", "I think that you are entitled to privacy in your own home and this is also a matter of respecting other people\u2019s possessions. I think that although the tik tok is harmless and the things she\u2019s doing is typical teen girl behaviour it doesn\u2019t mean that it should be ignored. Children should be spoken to when their behaviour is not appropriate. You need to sit down with your husband and explain this and urge him to set adequate boundaries with his daughter. The key is how you approach your husband, is natural for him to be defensive of his daughter, you need to be an ally in this situation Ultimately though this is a father daughter conversation.", "Violet is just being a teenager. There\u2019s so many popular TikToks reviewing beauty products. She\u2019s literally just repeating what she sees online. The fact that you have such a good relationship with her is really special, and your reaction to this issue could alter that relationship completely moving forward. I would just talk to Violet about how the videos made you uncomfortable, and talk about personal and private spaces. Then maybe offer helping her \u201cTikTok-ify\u201d her bathroom, get some products that she can review on her own. I don\u2019t think anyone is the asshole right now, but you\u2019re the adult here and if you blow this situation up and hurt your relationship with your step daughter, you will be TA.", "NTA\u2014 kids don\u2019t get to overstep your personal boundaries just because they\u2019re kids. \n\nThis is something that makes you feel uncomfortable and relates to your personal things/space. It\u2019s very reasonable to say \u201cplease don\u2019t touch my stuff\u201d with the expectation that your boundary will be respected. I\u2019m pretty visible online but would feel weird if someone went through my house and showed off my private things, even if they didn\u2019t use names. It doesn\u2019t mean your being stingy or have anything to hide, it just means you have a reasonable expectation to yourself and your privacy.\n\nIMO dad should have acknowledged your feelings and supported you. This could have been a really excellent learning lesson for Violet.", "NTA. It seems odd that you are reacting so strongly to makeup etc, but then I have never owned any of the products you mention and also, you feel how you feel.\n\nI think there must be a way to resolve this. It sounds like denying it is her account is pointless since you have what amounts to proof.", "NTA I get that she\u2019s a teenager and all that but it\u2019s your bathroom and your products and she didn\u2019t ask. You expressed your objections and got a poor response, it\u2019s time to lock up your stuff.", "NTA. She violated your privacy. I wouldn\u2019t be too upset with her this time, but moving forward, boundaries should be set. This way expectations are clear. If she continues to do it, then I\u2019d be mad.", "ESH. I agree this should be addressed but you\u2019re also overreacting. A lock on the bedroom door was not at all necessary, just a quick \u2018hey, I didn\u2019t love that, please don\u2019t do it again\u2019. And calling her weird was very uncalled for. So now everyone is reacting to your overreaction. Apologize for making it such a big deal and simply ask her not to do it anymore. She\u2019s probably going to stop anyways now that you\u2019ve freaked out about it.", "NTA - she should have asked. But she's also acting like a teenager and as step mum, good relationship or not, without the dad I think you'll be hard pushed to get her to own up.", "Why are you mad that she is having fun ? What is inherently wrong with her reviewing this skin cream other than it bothering you ??", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Violet didn\u2019t go through dad\u2019s stuff, she went through OPs stuff. It\u2019s OPs right to stand up for herself without having to defer to her husband. If someone else\u2019s kids went through my bathroom contents and filmed it for social media, I\u2019d say something, not tell their parents and wait for them to do something about it or not, especially in a situation where it might happen again.\n\nI do agree that the conversation would be most effective between the three of them, though. I suspect Violet had no idea what she\u2019s doing wrong and the whole thing could be discussed without blame. Dad needs to jump in tho.", ">get some products that she can review on her own\n\nThis is actually what I don't understand about the whole thing - she has an entire bathroom of her own stuff. I don't know if it's because the master bath is \"fancier\" or if my products are just trendier or maybe she just has a different account for her own stuff but I can't get answers from her so I don't know.", "For many children, if you bring up something in an accusatory way they will deflect and be defensive. It seems like you want to reprimand her, which is a good reason for any kid to be defensive. I don\u2019t think she even realized what she was doing was wrong. Not making this into a huge deal, I would just say hey, I know you made these videos and I need them removed. I would set new boundaries with her about touching and filming your things. Then be like, hey girl what can I do to help you? Seems like you\u2019re into TikTok, how can I make your bathroom nicer? I just feel like this is a huge opportunity to communicate, and get even closer about beauty regimens and products, as opposed to making this into a negative thing. Either way, I wish you the best of luck OP.", "thank you, i appreciate this a lot.", "DO NOT LET THIS SLIDE! You are entitled to privacy no mattervwhat", "What if you did a similar video presentation of her bathroom, etc.  people who overstep can see the harm when they feel the same thing done to them. If your husband finds what she did harmless he won\u2019t object.  If you deny you were the one who did it (as she has done), she can\u2019t call you on it either.", "NTA because you feel how you feel, but personally this wouldn't bother me. She doesn't show her or your faces in the videos.", "NTA\n\nYeah, I get it - Violet and her generation of over-sharers don't understand privacy. Most people would understand that posting videos of someone else's stuff is unreasonable. I have no idea why James thinks this is OK.", "NTA You are right to want your feelings acknowledged and your husband to speak to Violet. It is not okay for the two of them to dismiss your objections. You should not be expected to stifle yourself so as not to perturb Violet.", "Because it is not hers to review. It wasn't a jar of jam in the kitchen, it was OP's personal property. She didn't ask OP first and she is lying about what she did. If it was so okay to do it, why is Violet lying about it?", "NTA. It's kind of weird that she's pretending like the videos aren't hers and the dad is letting her get away with the lie.", "She has invaded your privacy and is clearly embarrassed. \n\nIf she wants to post this sort of content there may a way to do it with your permission.

While I am among those who don't understand why everyone has to show the rest of the world everything they do all day, including \"gee look at my food even though all I did was order it and had no hand in making it, aren't I amazing?\", it seems that having a TikTok following is a big deal for many. \n\nYou two sound like you have a great relationship and you should just explain to her that while you enjoyed how well she did the presentation, you were uncomfortable with her using your room for the filming.\n\nOffer to help her set things up in her bathroom or another part of the house and do her filming so she gets to share her \"expertise\" and you have your privacy.", "YTA in this situation but otherwise you are obviously a great step mother. Violet is treating you like you are her mother and is comfortable around you and clearly enjoys the makeup and skin care routine. Be happy you are bonded enough she is treating you like a parent which means minimal boundaries and not like a step parent where boundaries would exist. Embrace it - the years go fast and if you damage your relationship with her over this it may never recover", "Nta, she's old enough to know about boundries and privacy already", "I agree. It\u2019s kind of a compliment that she admires the space and the items, and she wants to show them off and \u201cpretend\u201d in this manner. She\u2019s been invited in to this area of interest, and now she\u2019s catching it because she crossed a boundary she she misunderstood. \n\nShe\u2019s a kid! What an opportunity to show her empathy and kindness, and that we all mess up (you do too, I\u2019m sure OP). Explain why this is a no-go for you, how her space and products can be used for this, and it\u2019s done. This is a great a chance to be a wonderful friend and mentor to her. She sounds like a typically respectful kid. She\u2019s more important than whatever you\u2019re trying to flex here.", "Because she admires you... And you really over r\u00e9acting. She does something very normal for her age and Time. Just have a good talk about privacy and boundaries.", "The reason it's a father-daughter conversation is the poster is not the child's parent. A stepmother is very important, but boundary sometimes need to come from the biological parent."]}
