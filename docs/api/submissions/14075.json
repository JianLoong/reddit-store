{"id": 14075, "submission_id": "12crbhs", "title": "AITA for telling my little sister it's not really my fault about what happened with her guinea pig?", "selftext": "I'm a (17f), and I have a younger sister named Dalila, who is 12. Dalila had two guinea pigs named Moshi and Yogi, and she got them a year ago. She has always been an animal lover and I think she took good care of them. But she had a huge ritual of things she thought they needed, that caused the issue in this story.\n\nI want to say bow that I am not at all an animal person except for dogs and cats. I know very little about taking care of them, as that has always been my sister's responsibility. Recently, Dalila had to go out of state for a week for a show-choir competition, and my mom and her boyfriend were busy. So, reluctantly, I agreed to take care of Moshi and Yogi.\n\nDalila left me a list of things to do for them. The next day, I had some issues. She wanted me to let them outside in a pen for an hour. It was a foldable one without a bottom, and had a cover for the top. I couldn't find the cover and called Dalila for help. She was dismissive and told me she couldn't help atm and was busy. I asked again, but she told me to just keep a close eye on them. I tried to explain I really couldn't because I had an online class, but she hung up on me. I thought the cover was probably to prevent the guinea pigs from escaping, so I left them in there and went inside attended my online class, checking on them occasionally through the window. I do admit tho that it was longer than hour bc my online class ended up lasting longer than an hour.\n\nWhen I went to bring them back inside, I found Moshi lying on its side and acting weirdly (hot to the touch, and twitching), while Yogi seemed fine. I tried everything I could, but Moshi sadly didn't make it. I informed my mom and decided not to tell Dalila until she returned home from the competition. We both agreed that it would be too stressful for her to hear the news during the competition (Dalila is really high strung, and would do poorly if we told her).\n\nAfter her competition, I texted her about what had happened, but she ignored my message. When she got home, she started screaming and crying, calling me a dumbass and other insulting shit. I told her I had called her and asked what to do, but she didn't give me clear instructions. She screamed that I knew she was busy, and shoud've waited. She basically said she's never trusting me again and that I'm a horrible sister, and I told her if anyone was horrible, it was her for choosing a literal guinea pig over her own sister and that it's not my fault. She cussed at me more and went to her room.\n\nMy mom sided with me, saying that Dalila needed to learn that owning an exotic animal comes with responsibility, and not many people know how to take care of them. However, her boyfriend took Dalila's side and even shouted at me, calling me a  POS and that 'he didn't want me to talk to his daughter anymore'. I am pissed at him and not talking to him.\n\nIt has been a few days, and Dalila is still mad at me and ignoring me. I want to make things right, but I also feel that her anger towards me is unfair. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680715049, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12crbhs/aita_for_telling_my_little_sister_its_not_really/", "score": 687, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What killed Moshi? Do you have a cat or dog? The fact that you can\u2019t see how irresponsible your own actions are is appalling. You seem to not care about your sisters pets or feelings. YTA 100%", "YTA, you killed her pet.", "YTA. How hard would it have been to either look around for the cover of the pen, or not leave them out there unattended?", "YTA\n\nthere were so many other things you could have done... you were negligent and killed her pet. \n\n> I also feel that her anger towards me is unfair.\n\nyou are wrong. you killed her animal, she has a right to be upset.", "YTA \\~ You even said *''it was her for choosing a literal guinea pig over her own sister and that it's not my fault''*  \nYou chose and agreed to be responsible for taking care of them, take responsibility.   \nYour sister has something you don't have, that's why you made that comment about her choosing a pig over you. unlike you she is responsible and has empathic capacity.  \nBlame shifting wont save you.", "YTA\n\nI am a long time volunteer at the house rabbit society, which takes in a LOT of guinea pigs. Moshi definitely either overheated in the sun, or was attacked by a predator.\n\nYou're 17 - basically an adult. You should have the presence of mind to realize that if you couldn't watch them, you should have left them inside. The cover serves a number of purposes like shade and predator safety.\n\nYou were explicitly told that they needed to be covered and supervised outside. You didn't have the cover, you weren't able to supervise them, and you put them outside anyway and hoped for the best.\n\nThis was a bad move.\n\nI would expect something like this is you were also 12, or certainly younger. But at 17, let this be a lesson that it's time to grow up and do some critical thinking without depending on your preteen sister to guide you.", "YTA\n\nHer guinea pig died under your care and there is no amount of arguing that will change that fact to your sister. You can't kill someone else's pet and then blame them for it ffs.\n\nYour best bet right now is sincere contrition/remorse. Lean into it because you were absolutely wrong for telling your sister that SHE is horrible because SHE picked you to take care of her pets. wtf dude.\n\nYTA...oh I said that already...good.", "\" But she had a huge ritual of things she thought they needed, that caused the issue in this story.\"\n\n \"I know very little about taking care of them, as that has always been my sister's responsibility.\" \n\n\nThat \"huge ritual of things she thought they needed\" was undoubtedly a detailed \"how to care for\" list. You admit you don't know how to care for them, yet you display a rather dismissive attitude towards her instructions on how to do just that.\n\nIf you agree to look after something for someone, especially if that thing is a beloved pet, you actually need to make time to look after that thing.\n\nMostly though I think it's your attitude to the results of this event that make you the asshole - your sister's pet died. She is clearly devastated by that fact, and instead of trying to empathise with how she's feeling, you are just sitting back going \"it's not my fault\" when yeah, it was\n\nSo one count of animal negligence and one count of bad sibling hood. I deem YTA", "YTA, the cover was to give them SHADE. Even if you put them in a shady location, they still need shade due to the sun moving over the course of the day. If you couldn't watch them at that moment, you should have waited until AFTER your class was over, OR found a fitted sheet to cover the top. She left her pets in your care, your negligence killed one and then you blamed her for you killing her pet. It's doubtful you'll ever have a relationship with her again no matter what you do to attempt to fix it.", "Why didn\u2019t you wait until after your class to take them out?\n\nWhat did the vet say happened to the little guy?", "You already know you are", "YTA. You killed the pet by (1) not covering the pen and (2) leaving them out too long. If you could not find a cover, you should have just not put them out; you yourself said you thought it was to prevent escape; so if it ran away, do you think that would not have been your fault? What if a predator got it?  Was it really so hard to find something else to cover the pen? A tray, a towel, or even a couch cushion?  You killed a defenseless animal through neglect. Own up to it.", "YTA - she gave you reasonable instructions and you let her pet die off sunstroke because you couldn't be bothered to find a cover.  Guinea pigs were also at risk from dog, hawk or fox attack or even in your own mind, escaping out the top. You didn't care because it was inconvenient to you to do so. You had things happening so would have been better not to risk them. \n\nNow your sister is hurt and grieving. And you and your Mum are just piling on the drama. \"Not your fault\" - you cooked her pet because you couldn't do the basics. And since when has a guinea pig been an exotic pet? I wouldn't trust you again - you killed her pet and instead of accepting the blame, you're doubling down on how she shouldn't be angry at you for letting her down in the worst way possible.", "You sound like a very selfish person. your mom too. \n\nYou know your sister is a CHILD. You're basically an adult, you should be able to figure out how to fix the issue you had. (google, call a vet, call petsmart, insta cart a plastic lid, the solutions are endless...) \n\nYour sister is hurt because you didn't give af about the guinea pigs. It sounds like, if they were a dog or cat, you would have gone out of your way to figure the issue out. Now a living, breathing creature your sister loved with all her heart, is dead. and you're never going to be able to take that back. You've created a stain on your relationship with your growing preteen sister. You've taught her that you don't reeeeeeally care about her (and her pets.)\n\nI wouldn't expect her to get over this. she will hold that pain forever in one way or another. \n\nYou're probably thinking \"it' only a guinea pig, wtf is this person's problem\" and if you do, you're a terrrrrrible person and I hope you get therapy. \n\nYour poor sister....", "YTA, firstly you\u2019re talking about a 12 year old as if you\u2019re in a dispute with an adult. \n\nYou\u2019re supposed to be more responsible than her. You agreed to take care of them, even though you\u2019re not an animal person. You prioritised an online class over the life of a pet that was entrusted in your care. When your sister reacted poorly to the news you called her horrible and guilted her for \u2018choosing\u2019 a Guinea pig over you. \n\nReally don\u2019t know what else needs to be said, YTA.", "So you mean to tell me that you didn't know that you shouldn't leave guinea pigs outside in the burning sun when you live in the south? YTA", "YTA. Your neglect directly led to Moshi\u2019s death. Also who tf texts someone to tell them \u2018oh yeah I killed your pet\u2019", "YTA. There's so many ways you could have prevented this. Number one, you could just have never agreed to take care of them. And WhyTF couldn't you have waited until AFTER your class to have them outside? Why put them outside at all if you're not actually going to watch them? Wild that you think SHE is the AH here", "YTA  or you got no common sense. She is 12, you are 17. You are practically an adult but you act like a careless child. You claim to know nothing about guinea pigs and try to portray your 12-year old sister as an expert, but you are dismissive of her instructions (\"she had a huge ritual of things she thought they needed\"). If you believed the cover was to prevent escape, why did you put them out there anyway? Even though you were unaware of the potential of heat injury, you believed the cover was important, and you put them outside anyway. That's completely irresponsible.  Instead of accepting responsibility for your mistake, you project it back onto your 12-year old sister. Pathetic.", "YTA\nYou forgot them and are trying to play it off. Admit what you did and that it was horrid you did a horrible thing", "YTA. You took on the responsibility of caring for the pig, you made a bad call, and her pet died as a result. That's on you.\n\nThat said, she really should have taken the time to help you find the cover or at least suggest you just not let them out that day.", "YTA. It sounds like you left them out too long, killing one of them.", "So let me get this straight. You\u2019re irresponsible and you don\u2019t make good choices. \nYou left the Guinea pigs outside without a cover in the sun in the south. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to release that animals in general shouldn\u2019t be left out in the hot sun, even dogs and cats need shade. You should have never taken them outside if you couldn\u2019t actively watch them. \n\nI\u2019ve noticed that when people on here say YTA you come back with an excuse for the response. \nAccept that YTA and you\u2019re selfish. \nApologize to your kid sister. She trusted you and betrayed her, by causing her beloved pets death. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f smh \n\nMy older brother let my Guinea pig die by not giving him water when I was 13 and I was gone for 6 days. And I\u2019m still pissed because I loved Ricky so much.", "YTA.\n\nYou could've waited til after your class to let them roam around without the cover, but you were negligent. \n\nTake some responsibility for what happened. The pet was in your care, and it died. \n\nIf I did this, I'd be doing everything to make it right. Including getting her a new guinea pig (even though I'm sure she feels her pet can't be replaced, I'd still try).", "So instead of just bringing them back inside and skipping their outside time for the day, you instead decided to leave them outside without sun cover for longer than an hour? Yeah, YTA. Your actions literally resulted in her pet most likely dying of heat stroke as what you\u2019ve explained are the symptoms of said illness.", "Bro how are not capable of keeping a Guinea pig alive for a day and your 12 year old sister can plus you wanna try to find a way to not blame yourself. Get a grip", "YTA. It's common sense that animals need shade in the sun, and it's common sense not to leave them unattended outside, and it's common sense not to agree to do something if you're going to break rules and take shortcuts doing it.\n\nThis isn't an easy \"exotic pet\" mix up, this is lack of care and lack of competence on your part. Even human children need a place to cool off.\n\nYou murdered a pet. And Guinea pigs are intelligent. That's why they should be in pairs or else they get depressed.", "YTA. You took responsibility for watching them and didn't follow the instructions you were given and killed your sister's pet with your negligence.", "YTA that guinea pig burned to death", "YTA, you could have done so many other things! In this instance, doing nothing would have been better.", "YTA\n\nIf you couldn't watch them, you should have left them in the cage. \n\nYou were careless because you couldn't have cared less. I get it you didn't care but you should have cared enough to make sure you didn't hurt your sister", "YTA\n\nYou could have googled why people cover Guinea pig pens... Takes seconds to look information up nowadays", "YTA - you left them outside in the heat for probably longer than you say in the post, accidental or not\n\nYou also handled it wrong by texting Dalila about it", "YTA\n\nYou killed her pet after you told her that you could look after them. She\u2019s never going to trust you again. \n\nAs someone who owned Guinea Pigs, they\u2019re fragile animals. That whole \u2018ritual\u2019 you\u2019re complaining about is actually necessary for their care.", "YTA\u2026you may have tried your best to care for them but your need to not take any responsibility came before any empathy for your sister. \n\nI don\u2019t like snakes but if my family member loved theirs and I wasn\u2019t even the one caring for it and it died I\u2019d feel like shit for them. You know she loved them so who cares about your feelings about them? \n\nYour sister is 12 and you will soon be an adult. Give her some grace for being mad and upset. Her pet just passed. \n\nYou\u2019re giving up far too much just to hang on being right. Tell her you know how much she loved the pet and you know how much that hurt her. Explain you are so sorry that you couldn\u2019t find the cover and then really thought it was just there so they wouldn\u2019t escape. Once you felt comfortable they wouldn\u2019t you thought it was ok. Give her a hug and say you wish you would have known better. Say you are also sorry for putting the blame on her because that\u2019s the last thing someone needs after losing something they love. \n\nShe may still get mad. Your goal is not to win or make this problem you have of feeling blamed go away. The goal is to try to put your feelings aside in hopes to make her feel better.", "If you can't comprehend taking care of a guinea pig don't, please don't, have a dog or a cat.\nYTA", "Exotic pet??? It's a guinna pig", "YTA. You left Guinea pigs unattended outside in the heat for over an hour and one died. Even with the cover, it might still have been too hot outside for them. If you were too busy to stay and monitor them, you should have just kept them inside. \n\nYou owe your sister an apology and I hope you will learn to be more careful with animals in the future.", "So you\u2019re really up here asking if you\u2019re TA for killing an animal? Um\u2026 yes YTA 100% and need to seriously apologize to your sister. But if I were here I\u2019d probably never forgive because, as an animal lover myself, my pets are my world. You suck", "YTA and you killed her pet, which likely suffered from the heat. Your laziness is understandable as a teenager but this lack of empathy and inability to feel remorse is a little sad and sickening. Your sibling now has a core memory of you killing their pet.", "YTA, biggest one I've seen on here in a while. You purposely neglected following simple instructions because of your bratty attitude towards animals and it resulted in her pets death. You then double down and say not everyone knows how to care for exotic animals. It's a guinea pig, not a tropical lizard.", "You are such a bad person.", "Soft YTA\n\n\nYou probably shouldn't have agreed to take care of her guinea pigs if you knew you couldn't handle it. Whether you reluctantly said yes or were super excited to take care of em, you still agreed to take care of them. Were there instructions to not let them out for too long without shade since they can die of heatstroke?", "YTA. Your sister has every right to be angry with you. It really doesn't take a whole lot of thought to realize that guinea pigs need protection if they're going outside - not just from sun but from predators. Honestly, if you didn't know better, you should have looked it up. And you certainly shouldn't have left them outside unattended.\n\nThat said, your mom and her boyfriend are also AHs. It's really more their responsibility to care for your sister's pets in her absence than it is yours.", "ETA except the Guinea pigs. Questions about animal care should\u2019ve happened before your 12 year old sister left. In lieu of that, Google exists. You are 17, and they are Guinea pigs. 2nd graders can take care of Guinea pigs for at least a few days, and by your own description they only made it 48 hours. \n\nEither you have executive functioning issues, or you\u2019re leaving out some important details here. A high schooler has a spare hour a day to watch some rodents run around in a pen. Doing that during your class is just not exercising common sense. \n\nLook, if you have resentment for your family, don\u2019t take it out on bystanders. The Guinea pigs didn\u2019t deserve that. \n\nThe 12 year old is an A for name calling, but she\u2019s also 12 and her beloved pet just died. \n\nYour mom and her boyfriend are As for not taking care of the pets while your sister was gone.", "YTA, my sister is the only person I'll let look after my pigs because she cares about doing it properly and sends me video updates so I know they are OK.\n\nI look after my friend's dog a fair bit, and while he's quite easy, I follow her care instructions while he's with me, because why wouldn't I? He's not mine but he's my responsibility during the time I'm looking after him.", "> I tried everything I could,\n\nWhat did you try? Did you take it to the vet?", "YTA. I think it's funny that you think saying you're a dog or cat person changes anything, what do you think would happen if you left a dog in an uncovered cage with I'm assuming no water since there's no mention of water?\n\nEdit; so umm......a guinea pig  is considered exotic?", "YTA \n\nFirst off, Guinea pigs are not exotic. They\u2019re actually very common. Second, you literally let her animal die, while you were watching it- it is your fault. Just like if a child died in your care, it would be your fault.", "YTA. You probably didn't kill her pet and it had pre-existing issues, but you could have found the cover or just put them back in.\n\nHowever this does read like you're feeling out upon in general by a demanding younger (step?)sibling. And your mother's boyfriend is not displaying a healthy dynamic.", "INFO: I don't understand. What killed the guinea pig? How did the lack of a cover cause the animal to die?", "YTA and so is your mom.   \nGuinea pigs are hardly exotic animals. They are a very common household pet - close behind dogs and cats.", "Sound like heat stroke might have killed it?

And for telling her via text!?", "YTA and guinea pigs are NOT \"exotic animals\". They are standard common as shit pet animals and about as easy to care for as they come. And you managed to kill one in a matter of hours because you couldn't be bothered to use your common sense. You should be ashamed of yourself but instead here you are asking the internet to tell you that you didn't do anything wrong. Well you did.", "YTA. And your responses here make you an even bigger one because you don't seem to be taking responsibility for the fact that your neglect lead to the death of a living creature.", "Yta even at 12yo if my siblings killed my pet through sheer laziness, they would be dead to me.\n\nIf you couldn't find the cover then they didn't go out. God forbid you have a child.", "YTA. You never leave Guinea pigs unattended. They are very curious animals and will eat anything. You killed her pet, well done.", "YTA obviously, you just baked your sisters pet to death. Even if you did have the cover, leaving them out there in the heat for hours would have probably killed them. You should have just not put them outside, better that they\u2019re in a safe environment and miss some fresh air. \n\nBut even if you hadn\u2019t 100% killed her pet (which again, you did) saying that it was her fault is wrong and childish. You sure your the older sibling? You and your mom both suck.", "I think I'm gonna probably post something controversial here but... NAH\n\nYour sister asked a kinda big favor from you, and while you are older than her, you're still a teenager. It was a little foolish to expect you to take care of animals you don't really like at a certain level... But the part that makes her kinda wrong here is that she was \"too busy\" to answer something that turned out to be of life threatening importance for the animal. That's her fault. She can't expect you to have known about animals you don't normally engage with or take care of. To be fair, she was at a competition, so it's reasonable she was busy/overwhelmed, but this was important enough to take a moment for.\n\nThat said, you knew there was an issue, she was too busy at that time with an event you knew she was attending, and you needed to immediately rush off for your online class... Why didn't you put the guinea pigs back in their cage, and then later resolve all the stuff and put them out when everyone was free to troubleshoot without other engagements? That was an irresponsible thing to do. But, again, you're only 17. I would expect an adult, with additional life experience and a fully formed brain with full, unimpaired executive functioning to understand that... You, not so much. But, perhaps you can see where part of her brain is blaming you for it?\n\nYou didn't do it on purpose, and you didn't know enough to know they could die from overheating; she didn't explain things to you properly and didn't give clear instructions. No one is acting out of malice here, it's just an unfortunate accident. However, she just lost a pet that was extremely important to her, and she's a child. Of course she is super upset about it and lashing out a bit, any child her age would. She's looking for a reason, as most people do in tragic circumstances, and trying to find something/someone to blame. It's the stages of grief. Part of her almost certainly also knows it was partially her fault and she feels super guilty, and she can't mitigate all her emotions right now. You're both kids, and I can't see how either of you could be called the asshole over this. It's a really sad situation, and it's gonna take some healing.\n\nHowever, in regards to this last \"...feel that her anger towards me is unfair\" part: Yes, you're probably correct that it's unfair, but she's grieving. You say you don't care much for animals, and those weren't yours, so you don't feel it, but she does. As a 12 year old, how many times did a friend say or do something mean that was the end of the world, and your friendship was over for like a week? Or did you ever have that one special item, a special stuffed animal or blanket, a treasured toy, etc. that got lost, or broken and felt like the end of the world? This is her beloved pet, that she doted on and devoted time to special treatment and scheduling her free time around, etc., dead. It's kinda a big deal to her, and she's not got the skills or understanding to cope with that grief at her age. Hell, loads of adults never gain that skill either. Give her a break here, don't expect her to just get over it in a couple days. There's every chance she's going to remember this for the rest of her life. You'll have a complaint if she's still being cold and distant to you and bringing it up as the justification for her attitude towards you at 24, but not so much with just a couple days, or even weeks, since the event. Everyone deals with grief differently, and some people do it faster than others. Don't negate her feelings on this, because doing so is likely to turn this into a lasting, two-way resentment that will build and permanently alter your relationship with her for life.\n\nShe's young enough most things are still formative experiences for her, so right now your compassion, or lack of it, can end up setting the tone for your relationship for life. If you teach her now that you don't care about her feelings, then you are liable to lose her trust forever. So you have a choice to make here about what relationship you want to have with your sister: You can be compassionate, accept her feelings, and allow her to feel accepted and loved... Or you can be self absorbed, teach her that you don't care about her feelings, and train her that you don't care about her or how she feels and ensure she doesn't trust you or ever come to you with problems or life events. It's kinda up to you now. She's going to feel however she feels, you can't control or 'fix' her feelings. You can either accept it, show her compassion, understanding, and love... Or you can shut that shit down, and make it really unlikely you'll ever have a relationship with her for life.\n\nSo you're currently not the asshole, but depending on how you decide to treat her over her grief, you certainly could become one.\n\nEdit: Lightened a couple of overly harsh sounding words in the first lines because, rereading it, sounded like I was being a dick to the 12 year old and I wanted to fix that.", "I don't think your the ah because you didn't even know how to take care of an animal and she expected a lot from you. As an animal parent they should have time to respond back to texts and calls I mean sure maybe a call is like not always good cause your bust but text you can be like hey I gotta to to the bathroom and stay there and text you back. And you were freaking out about the lid... she should have had everything set up for you to know where everything is. She should have texted you information repeatedly especially since you have no experience taking care of rodents. But you should have asked for help or taken care of them after your class.", "ESH. If you couldn't supervise outside, you shouldn't have taken them outside. You were irresponsible.

Dalila had two guinea pigs named Moshi and Yogi, and she got them a year ago. She has always been an animal lover and I think she took good care of them. But she had a huge ritual of things she thought they needed, that caused the issue in this story.\n\nI want to say bow that I am not at all an animal person except for dogs and cats. I know very little about taking care of them, as that has always been my sister's responsibility. Recently, Dalila had to go out of state for a week for a show-choir competition, and my mom and her boyfriend were busy. So, reluctantly, I agreed to take care of Moshi and Yogi.\n\nDalila left me a list of things to do for them. The next day, I had some issues. She wanted me to let them outside in a pen for an hour. It was a foldable one without a bottom, and had a cover for the top. I couldn't find the cover and called Dalila for help. She was dismissive and told me she couldn't help atm and was busy. I asked again, but she told me to just keep a close eye on them. I tried to explain I really couldn't because I had an online class, but she hung up on me. I thought the cover was probably to prevent the guinea pigs from escaping, so I left them in there and went inside attended my online class, checking on them occasionally through the window. I do admit tho that it was longer than hour bc my online class ended up lasting longer than an hour.\n\nWhen I went to bring them back inside, I found Moshi lying on its side and acting weirdly (hot to the touch, and twitching), while Yogi seemed fine. I tried everything I could, but Moshi sadly didn't make it. I informed my mom and decided not to tell Dalila until she returned home from the competition. We both agreed that it would be too stressful for her to hear the news during the competition (Dalila is really high strung, and would do poorly if we told her).\n\nAfter her competition, I texted her about what had happened, but she ignored my message. When she got home, she started screaming and crying, calling me a dumbass and other insulting shit. I told her I had called her and asked what to do, but she didn't give me clear instructions. She screamed that I knew she was busy, and shoud've waited. She basically said she's never trusting me again and that I'm a horrible sister, and I told her if anyone was horrible, it was her for choosing a literal guinea pig over her own sister and that it's not my fault. She cussed at me more and went to her room.\n\nMy mom sided with me, saying that Dalila needed to learn that owning an exotic animal comes with responsibility, and not many people know how to take care of them. However, her boyfriend took Dalila's side and even shouted at me, calling me a  POS and that 'he didn't want me to talk to his daughter anymore'. I am pissed at him and not talking to him.\n\nIt has been a few days, and Dalila is still mad at me and ignoring me. I want to make things right, but I also feel that her anger towards me is unfair. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

What was that exactly, since you say elsewhere that you didn't take it to the vet and had to go to piano classes right after your class?", "ESH, but not Dalila.  She is understandably devastated at losing a pet.  You should never have left the guinea pigs outside alone.  It's hard to say why one of them died, cover or no cover, but you absolutely should have stayed outside to supervise them.  They could have eaten something they shouldn't have, or gotten attacked by a predator, or maybe it was overheating, since the one that died was hot to the touch.  It sounds like you were busy, so you should have waited until you had time to stay out there with them. \n\nI think your Mom and her boyfriend, Dalila's father are also the AH's for being the adults in his household and apparently not taking any responsibility for their daughter's pets, and just leaving you to handle things on your own without knowing what you were doing.  Why didn't the guinea pigs stay with the Dad if they were so important?\n\nLosing a pet can be very painful, especially a pet that you love dearly, and it will probably be difficult for your sister to forgive you for awhile, so try to be understanding.  Instead of getting defensive, apologize.  You didn't mean to kill her pet, but your actions were careless - it's kind of like leaving the door open, and letting an indoor-only pet escape outside.

And your actions and mistakes are still your fault.

But you sound like you\u2019re showing zero remorse and trying to point the finger of blame back on your grieving sister who gave you explicit instructions. I think your sister would be far more forgiving if you were sorry but since it sounds like you don\u2019t care at all about the consequences of your actions because essentially \u201cyou didn\u2019t mean to,\u201d I don\u2019t blame her a bit because you need to apologize in order to be forgiven.", "Because I was busy most of the day and the only time I was home was during that online class", "Dalila says it was sun poisoning, and yeah I had to because I had piano lessons not too long after my online class so I had no other choice", "I feel slightly badly for OP because I know she didn't mean to kill the guinea pig, but who leaves animals outside for the first time without checking on them?

They're both very young, so not having this discussion is also not either of their faults (and based on OP's tone, Delila may have shut the discussion down before it even started).  Basically, it was an accident that was avoidable in hindsight, and there were things either party could have done to prevent it, so the fault is certainly shared, especially since the adults were not available either.    \n\n\nThey both need to forgive each other and move on (yes, the younger sister needs to forgive the older for the accident while the older needs to forgive the younger for being put in that situation and for the trauma of causing the death), and as such, both should apologize to each other for their part in it.

Or try to ask around for a ride? Or just *call the vet*, who could give recommendations over the phone? It was an emergency and you didn\u2019t do nearly enough.", "Thousands of people here all decisively agree you were the asshole. No point attempting to defend yourself at this point and argue.", "You should've skipped your piano lessons to take the guinea pig to an emergency vet. That's what a good sister would do. YTA", "Mom only knew after the guinea pig died. And I\u2019m sorry but no. Someone being \u201crude\u201d on the phone isn\u2019t an excuse to be so careless with their pet that you get it killed. OP knew her sister was  at a competition, where she likely can\u2019t talk, and the advice given was \u201ckeep a close eye on them,\u201d which OP didn\u2019t do. She\u2019s 17 years old. That\u2019s insane. She\u2019s the asshole.", "None of what you typed happened", "Then get a job and earn the money.", "You don't know how to work?", "I refuse to believe that you're that busy. Take responsibility for what you did. You're 17, not seven FFS.", "Then you should have eaten or done your homework outside, or just not done it that day (explaining to your sister that you had tried but couldn\u2019t find the top and wanted to follow her instructions as she wrote them). \nHindsight is 20/20, and I get that in the moment it might not have felt like a huge deal, but YTA. Even tho it was unintentional, you are responsible for a huge amount of grief and stress you\u2019ve caused your sister. My advise is to apologize properly, take responsibility, and if your sister is open to it, ask to learn more about Guinea pigs so you can be more prepared in the future. Assuming of course, that you want to put in the work to make things right.\n\nEdit to add: If your sister continues to be aggressive to you, despite you trying to apologize- that does not make your sister an A H. She\u2019s is coping with thinking she could trust her sibling to care for her most precious and cherished responsibilities, only to have the worst possible scenario occur. She does not have to forgive you, especially not while she\u2019s in mourning. All you can do is try and do better in the future.", "Oh poor your. I imagine it must be hard when your 12 year old sister doesn\u2019t help you with basic tasks. Do you starve if she doesn\u2019t make you food?", "You should feel ashamed of yourself, and the fact that you don\u2019t is really concerning. Do you not feel empathy for the animal you slowly cooked to death?", "Bro, she was probably super busy with her SHOW CHOIR COMPETITION THAT WAS OUT OF STATE\n\nso maybe call her back after the online class or use google???", "Calling and texting are not the same thing.\n\nHave you actually said \"I'm sorry\" to your sister yet?\n\nI'd be an emotional wreck if I killed someone's pet.", "Apparently you couldn\u2019t either because you\u2019re on here making all sorts of excuses why you couldn\u2019t have brought them in.", "You didn't answer my first question.  How long was the wait?", "You said you \u201ctried everything\u201d - what did you try? Did you call a vet? Did you look online for solutions?", "I delivered newspapers, cut lawns, and babysat.", "I mean, she thought it was to make sure they didn't get out.  Then she left them unattended, assuming that they could get out.  So i don't think she cared about any risks at all. I would have at least worried that an animal would eat them.\n\nShe could have googled why they needed a cover.", "She thought their was a risk, she didn\u2019t care about the risk.", "Lol you offered for someone else to \u201cfix\u201d the problem??? How generous. Not to mention Guinea pigs  are not interchangeable, they have personalities just like cats and dogs", "She\u2019s sad and angry, understandably so. But you should be the one to buy her a new one and also pay for it. Check out your local humane society\u2019s adoptable pet page and see if there are any Guinea pigs available.", "Google. That's how she should know. It takes about 30 seconds to find a list of dos and donts for guinea pigs. She should have gone to Google or called her mom to see what to do.", "Common sense!", "Didn't know what? That animals that live primarily in the house shouldn't be left outside unsupervised for more than an hour? Sorry, a 17-year-old should have more sense than that.", "The problem is not about what OP knew, it\u2019s about how much OP failed to display a basic level of care and continues to shirk responsibility.\n\nIs it her fault? Who cares. It\u2019s her responsibility.", "And when she was unable to because she couldn't find the equipment, she called Dalila, who should have said \"Don't put them outside, then.\"", "It's also important to note that guinea pigs are incredibly heat sensitive.  Even with water and a cover, they can easily overheat in relatively mild weather.", "In the late 70s, I didn't know that was hot enough to hurt them", "It died before piano lessons", "My experience as well.  Rats are awesome pets.", "It's pretty common sense that if any animal (humans included) are in the sun too long, it's dangerous. It's also pretty common sense that small squeaky things look delicious to bigger, carnivorous animals.", "How long were they actually out, though? Longer than an hour can mean a lot of things. \n\nI fell bad because I know it wasn't on purpose, but you did kill her pet. It sounds like heat stroke, with what little info we have. Did they have shade at all or direct sunlight?", "So you willingly left them in the sun for too long and caused one to die? Did they even have access to any shade or did you not even pause to grab a few hides and a water bowl?\n\nBecause that\u2019s the alternative to you forgetting.", "So you didn\u2019t forget, you on purpose left them outside longer than an hour in direct sunlight heat when the directions explicitly said they need a cover? Did you put them in the shade, since they didn\u2019t have a cover? Did they have water? Did you not think to do it before or after class? Why did you think that it was better to leave them outside without the cover, than to just not give them outside time until you could find it? Why did it have to be RIGHT THEN?", "Then he should\u2019ve taken care of his daughter\u2019s pets\u2026oh wait he was busy", "She is 17, with no car, and no money. Have you ever been to an emergency vet? It's not like the ER, they demand payment upfront.\n\nI understand you are angry at the thought of an animal dying, but you are berating a minor that had no resources aside from the internet.", "It died before piano lessons", "You are incorrect, check op's comments.", "I don't have time, I have a lot of volunteering and instrument lessons", "I brought it in sometime around 5, and it died maybe 25-30 minutes after. My mom was home 20 minutes after it died", "1. Ice water\n2. A vent\n3. I tried giving it a cool bath\n\nI did look online but I couldnt take it to the vet though", "An animal getting out of a pen and into a yard is a very different risk than \"exposure to sunlight can kill it.\"  If the pet had just gotten out, OP was looking out through the window and could have put it back in. \n\nThere's nothing to suggest that \"this is potentially really dangerous for the animal and I need to Google to find out more.\" \n\nMoreover, the sister's dismissive attitude on the phone doesn't suggest that the animals are in a huge amount of danger from direct sunlight. Rather, it suggests \"this isn't that big of a deal\" which I think is a normal assumption unless you already know that sunlight = dead guinea pig.", "70s in the sun without shelter is gonna get hot, obviously I'm not a vet so I'm not even going to speculate at what medically happened. I personally think it was too warm especially for a small animal to be contained with no shelter. Once you confine an animal to a space where they cannot reach a sheltered area you take on all responsibility to provide shelter for that animal. Yes your sister should have taken it more seriously, she is not completely blameless however I feel like the root issue here could have been easily solved with common sense or a quick Google search. Personally it seems like you knew they needed the shelter but decided to stay willfully ignorant in order to suite your schedule. I'm not going to say you are responsible for their death however your choices made your actions the most likely reason.", "Think about how you would feel laying in direct sunlight, in over 70 degree weather, without water, in a fur coat and thick heavy pants, for over an hour. You would not be comfortable. That poor animal suffered.", "*70s?* Look, I get that your negligence is rooted in ignorance, but you didn\u2019t even think to *google* some of this information? A wiki-how on Guinea pig care would\u2019ve gone a long way to stop this from happening.\n\nYour sister may never forgive you. I wouldn\u2019t. Be prepared to grovel if you *ever* want to have a relationship with her again.", "You said it died 30 minutes after you brought it in, but that was before piano lessons? But you also say you couldn\u2019t let them out after class and had to do it during class because you had to be at piano lessons right after?", "Not to everyone. Especially not to someone who shouldn't have been forced to take on this responsibility in the first place.", "Sure, everything that you already know is obvious. Unfortunately, things you don't already know are often much less obvious.", "I let them out at 3:50 maybe and brought them back in at 5:15", "I have taken animals to emergency vets, and twice before the age of 18. \n\nI just think it's ridiculous that a 12 year old is responsible for all the animal care, cats, dogs and guinea pigs, but the one time the almost-adult child is in charge, they don't even have the common sense to prevent a death. \n\nThe parents should've been more involved, but the 17 y/o should also be more responsible than to leave animals outdoors unprotected for over an hour. \n\nEven tho OP is technically a minor, they ARE responsible for this death and SHOULD take responsibility and properly apologize to their sister.", "\"It\" is your sister's beloved pet. Please be empathetic to your sister. If my sister killed one of my animals, I wouldn't speak to her for a very very long time. A pet isn't just a thing, it's a companion, a member of the family. She's in mourning, and you are responsible for the loss she is currently mourning.", "Where did OP say she checked on them multiple times", "Sounds like you need to grow up and make a compromise in order to do the right thing.", "You mean you've never known responsibility", "ANY animal can get heatstroke if left out in the sun too long under the right conditions.  You\u2019re not that stupid, are you?", "For future reference, especially if you plan on having a cat, dog, kid, any living thing can get sun poisoning. Even plants can get too much sun.", "If you were watching through the window, you would have seen when they immediately started acting strangely. You clearly were not actually watching or paying attention.", "YTA \n\nYou're 17. You have Google. You had options. \n\nThat tiny creature died in horrible pain because you couldn't be bothered to look after it properly. And now you seem more invested in avoiding blame than comforting your sister whose pet you killed. \n\nDo you usually struggle with empathy or compassion? Are you usually cruel? Or is this a one-off?", "You murdered an animal slowly over 3 hours. Think about that. You cooked it alive. It\u2019s organs shut down. And you did nothing. And you do not have remorse. And you are not understanding why your sister is distraught. You honestly should get your emotional capacity checked, because it\u2019s terrifying you aren\u2019t crushed for slowly killing a beloved creature.", "A HALF HOUR!!!!?????  You let an animal suffer in pain for a friggin half hour?", "Why couldn't you take it to the vet?", "So you didn't try the one thing that could have saved him.", "It's a rodent. Leaving them outside unattended is essentially a death sentence. If a hawk flew down and took one of the pigs, do you think her looking out a window would help?", "Yeah, My class normally ends at 5:00 and my lessons are usually at 5:30 but my mom was running late so it ended up being close to 6", "that's too much time, you never should've taken them out if you were just going to be constantly busy. how did you not think of this?", "So something you may not have known, they are a lot more delicate than a cat or dog. They are easy to kill. Leaving one in direct sunlight is kinda like locking a dog in a car.\n\nYou need to tell your sister sorry. You didn't mean to kill her pet but it happened. Imagine if she forgot to give a dog water while outside and it died from getting too hot or dehydrated. \n\nAnd I'm not a guinea pig fan. They are cute but I'd never own one because they are loud, can't be litter trained, and I have a bad history with rodents biting me and almost losing a finger because it got infected and awful overnight because I took care of someone else's pet. So this is just from a pet owner knowing how much she likely hurts from this.", "What temperature was it outside? Was it direct sunlight? Did they have water?", "\"checking on them occasionally through the window\". Its right there in the original post my guy.", "I mean ig I consider volunteering to be a responsibility", "I have a feeling we'll read about her on the news in a few years when she accidently leaves her baby in a hot car.", "So why couldn\u2019t you have waited to take them out between class and the piano lesson? Or done it any time in the day before class?", "Poor thing had to of been left in direct sunlight if the piggy was \u201chot to the touch and twitching\u201d when she found it more than an hour later.", "Like how you voluntarily took care of a guinea pig? I wouldn't be hard pressed to see that your \"charity\" is half assed.", "She was given a manual of care, and she ignored it. That makes her an asshole.", "She made a bad judgement call. If it had been something she truly could not have reasonably foreseen coming, I\u2019d be more understanding, but this was something she absolutely could have foreseen if she\u2019d taken the time to think it through - *no* animals should be left outside in the sunlight with no shade, that\u2019s not something unique to Guinea pigs that only an expert could have known. \n\nI\u2019m not saying she\u2019s a bad person or doesn\u2019t deserve forgiveness, but she *does* need to take responsibility. It *was* her fault, and her sister (a literal child!) has the right to be upset. \n\nThe YTA verdict in my eyes comes entirely from her trying to say it\u2019s not her fault, rather than owning up to the fact that she didn\u2019t use her critical thinking skills and an animal paid the consequences for it.", "Stop. OP is almost an adult. There is no excuse for this.", "I get home at 3:40ish, and I have online class at 4. I couldnt have done it between because thats not enough time", "according to another comment it was high 70s at 3:50pm when they went outside and were out until 5:15, so even not direct sunlight would\u2019ve been terrible for them :( so horrible", "I literally said she needed to take accountability for her mistake", "And when she called her sister to ask her where the cover went, her sister didn\u2019t take the 6 seconds it would\u2019ve taken to tell her where it is."]}
