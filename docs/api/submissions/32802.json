The whole 'Make me a list' thing is very frustrating. With him going off on deployment often etc I can appreciate that he might be cautious to step in on some things in case there have been changes to way stuff is done while he was away.

However thats obviously not a suitable excuse to do nothing!   \n\n\nWould you be open to a quick sit down with him each time he returns where you quickly run through how the house is running/any changes that might have occured while he was away and agree to basic & optimal standards of what the house should look like? I know you shouldn't have to do this and you aren't the manager of the house and he's an adult. \n\nI'm just trying to think of maybe a less exhausting compromise than making him daily chore list that fill the space of a family where one party is often away for a while and potentially aligns with workplace expectations that he's used to. \n\nAll else fails make a really infanalized chore chart with smiley face stickers so he realises what he sounds like when he asks for lists.", "NTA \n\nSeriously, what is so difficult about a grown adult handling basic house chores?? Back for deployment and familiar with the house or not - everyday chores should take 1 brain cell, tops. . . It's just as you said - if you see something that needs to be taken care of, you do it.

I am neurodivergent and I can be oblivious to things that need to be done around the house.  Laundry is a big one that gets away from me and I literally get to a point where I better do laundry or I\u2019m not going to have anything to wear. I\u2019m not avoiding on purpose, but it is out of sight, out of mind (laundry is in the basement and I never go down except to do laundry.)\n\nThe other thing happening is that your husband thinks you are handling it all fabulously and it doesn\u2019t cross his mind to offer to help. This is another thing I can be guilty of. I\u2019m focused on the 300 other things happening around me, distracting me, and it isn\u2019t until later that the lightbulb clicks on and I think duh.\n\nUntil my son moved out I made him a list of what to pack before we went on vacation. Otherwise he forgot things, didn\u2019t bring enough, etc. Sure, I could have let him suffer, but why do that? It upset him, spoiled the mood at some point, and he did do what he thought to be an acceptable job. The last time we sat down together and I explained how I came up with my own list so I knew I had everything. Yeah, he was an adult, but he also has severe ADHD to the point that I was once told I might have to be his executive assistant until he found someone who loved him enough to take over (100% true). \n\nIt is frustrating as hell to have to nag at someone, I know from experience. Even though your husband may seem capable of making his own list, if it makes life better why not help him out? \n\nPlease know I am not making any judgements. Just sharing another view. I\u2019ve been divorced for more than 10 years and I wonder how my marriage would have been if I had been a little less stressed about everything.

Why don't the two of you sit down together to do a chore chart with daily and weekly etc. chores that you both think need to be done and assign (together) one of you to do each.

That said, this needs to be a joint effort and not just you being the project manager.", "NAH. I get your point of view, but I have ADHD and need lists to function, so I can relate to him.

Bringing up kids with additional needs can be really stressful while juggling everyone\u2019s different therapies every week and a new list stuck on the fridge on a Monday morning means you both know exactly what\u2019s going on and I have found has been beyond helpful for me.", "Well he isn\u2019t used to being in the home atmosphere and how you keep things. Can you have a convo about your basic standards, like cleaning the dishes etc? \n\nDoes he legitimately need a list? Maybe he has trouble focusing. Maybe he\u2019s going through some stuff he isn\u2019t telling you about. Transitioning from active duty is hard and not always fully shared. \n\nI get the frustration. Just trying to see perspectives. I hope things get easier.", "NTA. But give him some slack, he hasn't figured it all out.", "NAH I get it. It's unfair that managing the household seems to be solely on you. However, not everybody sees things the same way. Something that's destroyed to you may seem just slightly messy to him. How was he raised? Was he expected to do chores? If not, he may not get when something needs to be done. Also, if he's been gone, it is much more your household than his in that if there's a specific way or time you want things done, you need to teach it to him.\n\nMake a list of daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly things. Have a discussion of what you mean with xyz and what your expectations are. If he can't follow after that, then yeah, he's an idiot.", "As a man in your husband's situation I struggle to give a judgement on this one. On one hand I understand your frustration of not getting enough help. On the other, I fully get his position as he is set to fail no matter what. So maybe ESH.\n\nIf I may suggest something? You own the house. As in, you are in charge. You decide what is clean, what is in order and what needs working on. He is your subordinate, or a \"child\" as everyone here puts it unkindly. First thing, it is not his fault for this arrangement. It is naturally occurring due to two people having different standards and different things they care about.\n\nSo instead of getting upset or trying to control him try to flip it around. Make him the owner of certain things. That is, ask him what chores he wants to take over, i.e. dishes, laundry, cleaning downstairs or bathrooms, etc. Then let him do his way, to his pace, his standard.\n\nIf his standard is way too low for your comfort, either accept it or discuss with him. Do not ever tell him that dishes need cleaning, he knows, he is in charge. As soon as you try to control it you take charge and he'll step back.\n\nI expect downvotes for this as people in your situation don't like to accept different perspectives and natural arrangements of things. \"Why can't he just step up\" - because he is not you.", "I get your frustration. Men and women are wired different and some men, while willing to help, just don\u2019t \u201csee\u201d it.

Ask him if he thinks making you be his mommy will somehow be something you find sexy.", "YTA.  The problem with sharing the cleaning duties, is that couples often have radically different ideas of what \"clean\" is.  One small example.  To the wife, \"clean\" means kitchen sink is always empty and so shiny that you see your own reflection.  To the husband, \"clean\" means he lets dishes sit for a day or two until they start to annoy him and then he tackles the matter.  To the wife, \"clean\" means no toys on the floor in the kids room.  To the husband, \"clean\" means he expects to watch his step in the kids room.  But as long as nothing stinks, that's fine....    To the wife, \"clean\" means the laundry basket is never more than half full.  To the husband, \"clean\" means he will take care of laundry when several loads are waiting.  But he WILL take care of it.\n\nYou write:  \"When I see the dishes are dirty, I wash them. \n\n\\-  When there's two large plates in the sink?

It's likely that what you call destroyed wouldn't even register as slightly cluttered when your hubby views it.

I think it's hardly worth it unless it is 2-3 loads waiting.  Maybe your husband thinks similarly.

If left on his own (like if he was a single father, or a custodial parent after divorce) the chores you complain about WOULD get done.  He wouldn't need anybody to make a list for him.  And he'd probably complete all chores to a higher standard than your own standard of cleanliness.  But here's the deal....the chores would not be done on HIS WIFE'S schedule.  \n\nYou should be grateful that he's willing to help you if you make a list.  That is fantastic!!!!

I (40f) know people get pissy about this, saying it's putting more work on the wife, but it's actually the best solution. \n\n I was the parentified \"I don't need to be told why should I help you!\" Wife to a spoiled \"nobody taught me anything \" man. \n\nWhen we finally sat down and talked about it we just deligated my least favorite things to him to manage. I talked about my expectations of the task- because I want them done \"right\" which is subjective.\n For example dishes to him was wash them whenever it's a mountain and we need plates. For me it's wash them every night before bed , clean the table, counter, stove and sink. \n\nOnce he had his clearly defined  tasks he built a routine and I haven't had to worry about them at all for years. The problem is solved and we can coexist peacefully.  That should be the goal.", "And that's the biggest difference. I also like to use lists. But I make them myself. Using a list is fine, but it is your own responsibility to draw this up", "It's been 7 months since he's been home from deployment, and I've been quiet, but it's to the point where I'm burnt out and exhausted.", ">\"Why can't he just step up\" - because he is not you.\n\nWhy can't he just step up is because he is not willing to become a responsible adult and learn how to behave like one.\n\nOP is not his Mommy. It's not OP's job to give him directions. OP has **more than enough on her own plate caring for 2 special needs children,** without having to be reponsible for an additional child who is too helpless for adulting.\n\nNo responsible adult *needs* to be told what chores have to be done. He's got eyes, he can see. He *knows* that dishes have to be washed or put in the dishwasher. He *knows* that laundry has to be washed and dried. He *knows* that when there is stuff all over the floor it has to be picked up and put away. He *knows* when the floor is dirty that it needs to be swept or vacuumed.\n\nHe's just not willing to make the effort to be an equal partner.", "The point about how often to vaccuum is solid, but other things are just standard - dirty dishes are meant to be washed. Clean clothes are meant to be folded and put away. In a busy household with kids, things like laundry and dishes are not a question of when, they are pretty much an ALWAYS chore. Putting the responsibility on one partner for chores is unfair. Why is your question about him reading her mind, instead of why isn't he using his mind to just do housework that always needs to be done?", "I'm not asking for the moon, and I'm not a OCD cleaner. If he washed just half of the dishes sink, I'd be happy because it's one less thing for me to do. If he threw half a pile of laundry in the washer and started the load, I'd be happy with that, too. Just don't want to stop and have to tell them to do it.", "this is very long winded way of saying your down for the husband to act like a child an practice weaponized incompetence. he knows exactly what clean means, he knows exactly what needs to be done he lives there. he had to keep his barracks tidy he can keep a house tidy an take care of his own children. clean means clean, the only people confused by it are those who were enabled to never clean up, like a child.", "But... Why?", "He has eyeballs. He shouldn't need a fucking list.\n\nHe has to keep his barracks tidy, he can keep a house tidy.", "He's been home from deployment for 7 months now...I've been taking care of everything alone for all the months he's been deployed, with no breaks.

Lists are for things that are not always obvious, appointments you were not there to know about, home maintenance that is easily overlooked etc. using your eyeballs to see if a wash needs done does not need a list, washing dishes in a full sink does not need a list! When your petrol light comes on do you ignore it until someone tells you to do it? No!! \n\nI will die on this hill!", "This describes exactly why I broke up with my ex. It was the first long-term non-abusive relationship I had and just... I couldn't deal with it. I didn't understand why he never noticed anythign adn even things I stated very explicitly he would ignore. This lead to him telling me he had to walk on eggshells around me... but I communicated to him direclty and calmly, would get shut down, and after doing that seeveral times over an issue that was really affecting me, I'd get upset. Then I'd be accused of being negative and not wanting to solve the issue.\n\nI had a stress breakdown one day (partially related to a stress injury in my spine which resulted from being in grad school, being AuDHD, having PTSD, and this emotional stress). I told him I couldn't keep solving my problems, his problems, our problems, everything around the apartment... he then told me just tell him what to do and he'd do it. I asked him if he'd stir ingredients if I put them in a bowl because I wanted to bake but couldn't stir because of my injury. He told me he didn't know how and I'd have to show him how to stir... dude was 35. I got upset because he would say when I brought things up calmly he ignored them because I Was just complaining, but when I brought things up and got upset (after not being heard the first 10-20 times) he said he thought I didn't mean it and was jsut being emotional.\n\nHe said he didn't know what I meant sometimes or thought I was just talking to talk (?) and I told him to straight up ask me if he doesn't know what I'm trying to communicate or what/if I'm trying to solve something. He told me he wouldn't do that because I'd just get angry... like, no, you've never done this and I'm literally telling you how to communicate with me. I have ASD, I mean what I say and there is not a hidden meaning. Worst I'll do is not say I'm upset right away because I'm trying to sort out if I'm triggered and it's not the person's fault at all or if I'm upset about something valid (the joys of being a late diagnosed neurodivergent). He told me he just couldn't do anything right and was tired of walking on eggshells around me. I was so confused... because, he actively didn't listen to me and if this was him \"walking on eggshells\" I have no idea wtf he thought I was doing. \n\nHe'd bring up really minor issues when I'd get upset and break after trying to raise the same issue with him that was affecting my mental health several times and get weird when I'd get calm and immediately give him 3+ solutions. I asked him why he never brought these things up unless I was upset and he said he wasn't going to complain about \"Every little thing\" and the things he brought up weren't important enough to discuss and didn't matter. I asked him if they didn't matter, why bring them up when I'm crying from stress and he couldn't answer. He was not happy when I told him he was either bringing them up because they were important to him or he was using them as a distraction technique. He told me it wasn't his fault for not being raised to learn how to deal with his emotions... I told him I understood because I was physically abused for showing the \"Wrong\" emotions and I told him he was capable of learning how. I tried to suggest therapy, but no because he's \"not broken.\" I tried to suggest self help books or something, but no. He wanted me to teach him how to manage his emotions. Like, dude... I have enough on my plate. \n\nPositive: this was the final straw that broke and made me say no more dating men. I'm bi, or thought I was, and I don't know if I'm a lesbian or I have just been through so much trauma and BS because of men that I just have 0 romantic interest in them.", "I love that article!

I personally need lists and schedules, hence I make some for myself at home and at work. A joint chore chart is key, imo, to avoid arguments on who should do what and what level of messiness is acceptable (it's fairly rare that two people have the same mess-tolerance). It also shifts responsibility from one person to both of them as the day's or the week's responsibilities become defined.", "Exactly, or it has to be a collaborative effort to distribute tasks.", "I totally get it.

I'm not saying it's ok for him to ask her to write the lists. It's not. But at the same time, you cannot expect the other person to read your mind and to see what chores are important to you. As a simple example, I don't mind if dishes sit overnight, but I do know some people do. This is something that needs to be negotiated and added to the chart. It's about finding the best balance where you can be a team and not adversaries who each think the other is unreasonable.\n\nAnd of course everyone with eyes can see the filth. It's just that different people see it differently. A drop of dried sauce on the counter will send one person fetching a cleaning rag right away while another person may think it's no big deal since the counter will need to be wiped after doing the dishes.\n\nIf you and your partner happen to be on the same page automatically, that's great and I'm really happy for you. Many people aren't as lucky. That is why talking things through and jointly setting expectations and chore schedules is important, imo.", "I meant that I think they're having a pretty simple miscommunication. \n\nThey have different ways of organising housework and different ways of communicating. He\u2019s been out of the household for a long time and probably assumes she\u2019s got systems in place. \n\nBy asking her what she wants him to do, he's letting her have her pick of which chores she wants to do and which she wants him to handle. That way they won't get in each other's way.\n\nEither way, throwing around blame and words like weaponised incompetence like confetti, when he actually *does* want to do the work won't accomplish anything. Communicating openly is key and neither of them are doing a great job at that.", "Taking the mental load off her could be him making an extensive list and her adding some activities he forgot. With the emphasis on *some*.\n\nMaking a list together could result in her making the list and him sitting next to her and watching her making the list. Maybe sometimes commenting on how unnecessary some stuff might be."]}
