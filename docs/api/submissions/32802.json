The whole 'Make me a list' thing is very frustrating. With him going off on deployment often etc I can appreciate that he might be cautious to step in on some things in case there have been changes to way stuff is done while he was away.

However thats obviously not a suitable excuse to do nothing!   \n\n\nWould you be open to a quick sit down with him each time he returns where you quickly run through how the house is running/any changes that might have occured while he was away and agree to basic & optimal standards of what the house should look like? I know you shouldn't have to do this and you aren't the manager of the house and he's an adult. \n\nI'm just trying to think of maybe a less exhausting compromise than making him daily chore list that fill the space of a family where one party is often away for a while and potentially aligns with workplace expectations that he's used to. \n\nAll else fails make a really infanalized chore chart with smiley face stickers so he realises what he sounds like when he asks for lists.", "NTA \n\nSeriously, what is so difficult about a grown adult handling basic house chores?? Back for deployment and familiar with the house or not - everyday chores should take 1 brain cell, tops. . . It's just as you said - if you see something that needs to be taken care of, you do it.

I am neurodivergent and I can be oblivious to things that need to be done around the house.  Laundry is a big one that gets away from me and I literally get to a point where I better do laundry or I\u2019m not going to have anything to wear. I\u2019m not avoiding on purpose, but it is out of sight, out of mind (laundry is in the basement and I never go down except to do laundry.)\n\nThe other thing happening is that your husband thinks you are handling it all fabulously and it doesn\u2019t cross his mind to offer to help. This is another thing I can be guilty of. I\u2019m focused on the 300 other things happening around me, distracting me, and it isn\u2019t until later that the lightbulb clicks on and I think duh.\n\nUntil my son moved out I made him a list of what to pack before we went on vacation. Otherwise he forgot things, didn\u2019t bring enough, etc. Sure, I could have let him suffer, but why do that? It upset him, spoiled the mood at some point, and he did do what he thought to be an acceptable job. The last time we sat down together and I explained how I came up with my own list so I knew I had everything. Yeah, he was an adult, but he also has severe ADHD to the point that I was once told I might have to be his executive assistant until he found someone who loved him enough to take over (100% true). \n\nIt is frustrating as hell to have to nag at someone, I know from experience. Even though your husband may seem capable of making his own list, if it makes life better why not help him out? \n\nPlease know I am not making any judgements. Just sharing another view. I\u2019ve been divorced for more than 10 years and I wonder how my marriage would have been if I had been a little less stressed about everything. If making a list that I knew would get done helped I would have. I had the issue of not wanting to help with any list", "NAH. Why don't the two of you sit down together to do a chore chart with daily and weekly etc. chores that you both think need to be done and assign (together) one of you to do each.

Bringing up kids with additional needs can be really stressful while juggling everyone\u2019s different therapies every week and a new list stuck on the fridge on a Monday morning means you both know exactly what\u2019s going on and I have found has been beyond helpful for me.", "Well he isn\u2019t used to being in the home atmosphere and how you keep things. Can you have a convo about your basic standards, like cleaning the dishes etc? \n\nDoes he legitimately need a list? Maybe he has trouble focusing. Maybe he\u2019s going through some stuff he isn\u2019t telling you about. Transitioning from active duty is hard and not always fully shared. \n\nI get the frustration. Just trying to see perspectives. I hope things get easier.", "NTA. But give him some slack, he hasn't figured it all out.", "NAH I get it. It's unfair that managing the household seems to be solely on you. However, not everybody sees things the same way. Something that's destroyed to you may seem just slightly messy to him. How was he raised? Was he expected to do chores? If not, he may not get when something needs to be done. Also, if he's been gone, it is much more your household than his in that if there's a specific way or time you want things done, you need to teach it to him.\n\nMake a list of daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly things. Have a discussion of what you mean with xyz and what your expectations are. If he can't follow after that, then yeah, he's an idiot.", "As a man in your husband's situation I struggle to give a judgement on this one. On one hand I understand your frustration of not getting enough help. On the other, I fully get his position as he is set to fail no matter what. So maybe ESH.\n\nIf I may suggest something? You own the house. As in, you are in charge. You decide what is clean, what is in order and what needs working on. He is your subordinate, or a \"child\" as everyone here puts it unkindly. First thing, it is not his fault for this arrangement. It is naturally occurring due to two people having different standards and different things they care about.\n\nSo instead of getting upset or trying to control him try to flip it around. Make him the owner of certain things. That is, ask him what chores he wants to take over, i.e. dishes, laundry, cleaning downstairs or bathrooms, etc. Then let him do his way, to his pace, his standard.\n\nIf his standard is way too low for your comfort, either accept it or discuss with him. Do not ever tell him that dishes need cleaning, he knows, he is in charge. As soon as you try to control it you take charge and he'll step back.\n\nI expect downvotes for this as people in your situation don't like to accept different perspectives and natural arrangements of things. \"Why can't he just step up\" - because he is not you.", "I get your frustration. Men and women are wired different and some men, while willing to help, just don\u2019t \u201csee\u201d it.

Ask him if he thinks making you be his mommy will somehow be something you find sexy.", "YTA.  The problem with sharing the cleaning duties, is that couples often have radically different ideas of what \"clean\" is.  One small example.  To the wife, \"clean\" means kitchen sink is always empty and so shiny that you see your own reflection.  To the husband, \"clean\" means he lets dishes sit for a day or two until they start to annoy him and then he tackles the matter.  To the wife, \"clean\" means no toys on the floor in the kids room.  To the husband, \"clean\" means he expects to watch his step in the kids room.  But as long as nothing stinks, that's fine....    To the wife, \"clean\" means the laundry basket is never more than half full.  To the husband, \"clean\" means he will take care of laundry when several loads are waiting.  But he WILL take care of it.\n\nYou write:  \"When I see the dishes are dirty, I wash them. \n\n\\-  When there's two large plates in the sink?

I think it's hardly worth it unless it is 2-3 loads waiting.  Maybe your husband thinks similarly.

If left on his own (like if he was a single father, or a custodial parent after divorce) the chores you complain about WOULD get done.  He wouldn't need anybody to make a list for him.  And he'd probably complete all chores to a higher standard than your own standard of cleanliness.  But here's the deal....the chores would not be done on HIS WIFE'S schedule.  \n\nYou should be grateful that he's willing to help you if you make a list.  That is fantastic!!!!

I told him I understood because I was physically abused for showing the \"Wrong\" emotions and I told him he was capable of learning how.

It's probably a lot of weaponized incompetence, but maybe he just wants the structure like he gets in the military. Just make sure that list covers _more_ than 50% of the total time it takes to do the chores. Because making the list is a chore and you will be picking up any misc stuff not on the list which means you have to be aware of those things creeping up which is another chore. So the only way to make it fair is if he has to do more. Plus he isn't doing any of it while he's gone so maybe make it 75%.

They are happy to help, you just have to move them in the right direction.\n\nI have a husband like this.  But whenever I ask him to do something, he does it.  So to make life easier on myself, there is a chore list posted that includes the children and both my husband and I.  It is a simple task that makes life easier for everyone, there is no question as to what an individuals task for the day are, they are posted.  This works out beautifully, as we all take a look at the list each day to see our assignment.  I get the necessary help to take care of household chores and no one has to ask me what they need to do.

Is that unfair to you. Yes. But if truly want it to get better I would talk with him about the mental workload and how you need the help there. Then put him through a \u201cmini boot camp\u201d of what happens at home. A week where he just shadows you to understand the ins and outs and where things go. \nAfter that if he can\u2019t participate without a list, then that is a larger problem. But he is literally trained to follow orders and have expectations after being taught a new skill. Use that. \nYou didn\u2019t mention if he is good about doing a list if you do give it to him without you having to follow up?

Plus, things change day to day, so if he crosses off fold the laundry and water the plants, yet there's an overflowing trash can in the kitchen he'll just leave that alone? No, he's gotta think on his feet like he does in other areas of his life. \n\nDemanding your partner make a list for you is laziness.
