This isn't a zero-sum game. Treat others how you would like to be treated.", "I don't think this situation has a clear moral answer one way or the other. You're right that your friend is presumably fully capable of finding the same scholarship program if he bothers to look. At the same time, you should consider your friendship with him and whether you want to risk him becoming upset with you if he finds out you hid the scholarship program from him. You're certainly under no obligation to tell him, but I think he would also be rightfully hurt that you didn't share the information with him if that is normally the type of friendship you have. It is a very difficult situation. I would say there is NAH, no matter what you ultimately decide to do.", "NTA. I'm sure it feels wrong but when it comes to scholarships and even jobs, it's not a team activity with a team payout. You don't have to share every opportunity that you come across.", "Logically, NTA. But you have to ask yourself, is the scholarship is worth sacrificing your friendship? In your position, I would tell my friend because I would rather not have feelings of guilt and deception. It's really about what you can live with.", "NTA.  Keep all your money matters private.  Share details only with your accountant, financial advisor, and maybe your spouse.", "Honestly this is an extremely grey area but as this is AITA, you\u2019re ultimately the YTA.\n\nAs you mentioned he\u2019s your best friend, won\u2019t you want the best for him too? I would like to believe he\u2019ll want the same for you too. You know it\u2019s something that can be beneficial to him but intentionally withheld it so that you can somehow stand a better chance of getting it; you do know there is no guarantee that he\u2019ll be the cause of you not getting the scholarship or you may still not get it even if he didn\u2019t apply for it.", "YWBTA but the fact that you are bothered by it is good.  If you get accepted you will have to tell him & it will hurt his feelings to know that you didn\u2019t tell him.  Would he tell you? If your answer is yes, then I would tell him if you respect your relationship.", "YWBTA\n\nIf I weren't good enough for the 29 other slots, I'd be happy for a friend I truly cared about getting one. Provided you know he would really value the scholarship and is in line with what he wants.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, the opposite isn't true: If he didn't tell me, then I don't think I would be justified in feeling angry. I wouldn't be entitled to know about his scholarship application, in the same way that I wouldn't be entitled to know how he manages his money or something similar (I know the analogy is flawed, just the general point).", "This is a very weird analogy that doesn't work for me.\n\nIt's pretty simple: do you want to help your friend? I find your fear of him \"replacing\" you to be incredibly unfounded. You don't mention how many total applicants this program receives, but there are 30 spots, not just one. You also are thinking that if you don't get in, it's his fault entirely and not the 29 other people who made it in, or the actual people in charge of deciding the scholarship admissions. I see this as a situation with minimal self-risk to help your friend out, as opposed to extreme risk if you do get in and your friend is left wondering why you didn't tell them.", "There's a difference between him being entitled to the information and you being an asshole for not telling him. It's true that you take a small amount of risk by telling him and expanding the applicant pool. What's really at question here is whether you're willing to accept a small amount of risk to potentially help your friend out a lot. \n\nNot telling him says \"I'm willing to fuck you over for relatively minor personal benefit\" and telling him says I'm going a little bit out on a limb because this friendship is worth it.\"\n\nBesides, you're probably going to have to keep it a secret from him if you don't tell him which is stressful and is its own second insult to the relationship."]}
