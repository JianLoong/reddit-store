One of my closest friends cheated on her husband, and honestly, I was so mad at her. Like head explode mad. I told her if her affair continued I could no longer remain friends with her. I am not the reason she ended the affair, her children and her husband were, but she did and she and her husband worked through it and are better now than before. \n\nPeople make mistakes. People fuck up. It is human nature. But you are her brother, and she is your sister. You do not have to cut her off or cut her out of your life unless YOU deem it necessary. It is not your wife's place to demand that of you. In fact, I thinks it pretty shitty that she is.", "NTA cheating on someone doesn't mean you should be cut off by your entire family. You face consequences in the relationship, it's not your family's job to punish you.", "INFO:  Was your sister married to your wife's brother?  Your wife's friend?  Your friend?\n\nIf no to any of those question, then NTA.\n\nIf yes, that might be a different story...", "NTA. There is not reason for you to \u201cpunish\u201d your sister. She has not wronged you or your wife. Sure, she\u2019s mucked up her own life - and that\u2019s too bad, but it doesn\u2019t reflect on you that it happened, nor that you remain in contact with her. At the end of the day, we usually side with our blood families, even when they do really stupid stuff, because we are wired for that - and also because she\u2019s your little sister! It would take me a hell of a lot to cut my brother or any of my brothers-in-law off.", "NTA. Honestly that is incredibly strange of your wife.", "NTA I think times have moved on since The Scarlet Letter. Your wife's puritanical views have no place in modern society and you don't need to shun your sister. At the end of the day, you decide what type of relationship you have with your sister, not anyone else including your wife.", "NTA.  Your sister made a mistake and is paying the consequences, she doesn't need any more punishment,  she just needs to know that her family will support her even when she makes mistakes.", "NTA. It's absolutely unreasonable for her to try to control your relationships. I hate cheaters, too, but I'd never demand this of my partner. My partner is their own person, and associating with their siblings =/= an endorsement of cheating.", "NTA but it\u2019s very clear your wife\u2019s insecurity is now also one of the consequences of your sister cheating. \n\nI feel like you can support your sister without invalidating your wife\u2019s feelings as \u201cbackward\u201d and \u201cunreasonable\u201d, since you yourself said you normally wouldn\u2019t associate with a cheater. To be clear I still think your wife\u2019s demand is out of line.", "NTA. Hate the sin, love the sinner, all that jazz. \n\nYou can love your sister and have a relationship without condoning cheating. If your wife wants distance that\u2019s fine, but she can\u2019t force you to cut her off", "NTA. Your wife needs therapy. Bad. She either trusts you or she doesn\u2019t. And if her trust is contingent on you cutting out people she feels threatened by, then she doesn\u2019t trust you.", "NTA Your wife is trying to control your relationship with your sister to  alleviate her insecurities about her relationship with you. I think you stated your opinion quite well. Perhaps your wife should seek out counseling about her issue.", "NTA. That's a very big ask", "NTA.  I hate that shit.  Any idea how many people cheat??  A lot.  Clearly it is a common human issue.  Someone may hate it, they can break up with someone for cheating if they feel that way.  That is fully their right.  You know what isn't their right?  Projecting their insecurities onto You and demanding you have no relationship with your sister.  You are not your sister's SO.  Her romantic life is her business.  Suggest some therapy for your wife.", "NTA", "NTA  I could see it reflecting badly on you if you were covering for her or something, but this is nothing like that and your wife is being silly.", "NTA your wife though should prob speak with someone as it seems she\u2019s deeply insecure about cheating. Idk how loving your sister makes you accepting of cheating especially if you told her you were disappointed in her. But your right, she\u2019s your sister and people make mistakes. You don\u2019t throw out an entire sibling because your wife has issues. I\u2019m glad you defended your sister here. Your wife def needs to chill.", "NTA yes cheating is frowned upon, but if she wasn\u2019t happy the good for her.  You are supporting your sister to be happy or make a mess, regardless she\u2019s your sister", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes, your sister is an AHOLE for cheating, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to cut her off. Your wife made quite the leap from accepting your sister (and not the cheating) to you approving of it to a point that you\u2019re going to do it too. If your sister had used you to unknowingly facilitate the cheating by using you as a cover story, etc., then yes that\u2019s a different story and should be cut off. But as it stands now your wife needs to get over herself.", "NTA \n\nAs a grown adult, you are capable of making your own decisions. Your wife doesn't have to agree with you decisions.\n\nShe cannot dictate your decisions anymore than you can dictate her decisions.", "NTA. Your sister's marriage has nothing to do with you. She lost her marriage because of what she did in it, but she didn't cheat on you and your wife. Her relationship with you should have nothing to do with her relationship with her ex.", "this one is tough but i\u2019m going to go with NAH. For you she is still your sister regardless of her infidelity, but i hope your talk really made her understand what cheating does to other people. For your wife i understand her viewpoint as well because cheating on your SO is a very big thing and i can see why she is scared you would do it as well. Talk it out with her and show her that you don\u2019t condone or accept cheating at all", "Everyone here is telling you NTA and i would say that too but I noticed again how differently women are treated. It was the same situation and im not kidding 90% of the comments were telling her that her boyfriend is right and his feelings are valid. I even got downvoted so much because i said that she shouldn\u2019t cut the contact with her sister because she is her sister and they have a good relationship. They were defending her boyfriend so much. Really interesting", "NTA, WTF your sister is WAY out of line to tell you to cut your sister out of your life. This is abusive behaviour. She is trying to separate you from your family", "NTA - my brother was a serial cheater and I got to a point where I started to think I should cut him off because I'd never be friends with someone like that. But I gave it some time and he started getting help. He is on medication now and seeing a therapist and doing much better. He's focusing on his day to day life now instead of looking for the next high. I'm really glad I stuck it out and didn't say anything I would regret. Now that he's gotten professional help, he is also easier to talk to and more down to earth. We can talk about real things now. People can change and grow, and I'm so glad I was there for it.", "NTA the affair cost her her marriage why should it also cost her her brother?  You're taking a decent stance on it.  She'll live with that forever", "Jesus, cutting her out is a bit extreme. Your wife is being unreasonable.", "NTA.  Your relationship with your sister is none of her business.  If she wants to cut her off she can but doesn\u2019t mean you have to.", "NTA\n\nShe cheated on her husband and he\u2019s left her. You can make your disappointment clear without  cutting her out. Refusing to cut her out isn\u2019t tacitly endorsing cheating.", "NTA\n\nSince your wife has appointed herself as the morals police, tell her \"judge not, lest ye be judged.\" If she persists, ask her if the reason she is so upset is because her lover cheated on her ... with your sister.", "NTA. Your sister cheating is no indication that you\u2019ll do the same. That was an inappropriate conclusion to jump to on your wife\u2019s part. You were disappointed/angry with your sister and made sure to tell her that. It isn\u2019t like you swept it under the rug.\n\nIf your wife doesn\u2019t want to talk to your sister that\u2019s her own decision. She doesn\u2019t get to decide for you.", "NTA. Yeah your wife is absolutely trying to turn this into a hard line to force you to get rid of your sister because she has a personal issue. Honestly this just sounds like something where you need to press that your wife goes to counseling. She has an issue inside her. She needs to handle her issue, you don't have to completely abandon your sister just because your sister is an asshole", "YTA\n\n\u201ctold her yeah normally I wouldn't associate with cheaters but at the end of the day she is my sister.\u201d\n\nSo you understand why she would be concerned because if it was anyone else you could have cut them off. So why are you surprised she\u2019s having this reaction? It\u2019s not HER sister, she doesn\u2019t care for her like you do, so she doesn\u2019t understand. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you actually talk to her calmly and say yeah she\u2019s a cheater but I\u2019m not going to cheat on you, and talk her through it. Doubling down and telling her it\u2019s none of her business make you an asshole. She is your wife and you\u2019re acting like you don\u2019t even like her. She has fears and concerns. So talk to her calmly about it.", "ESH. You and your wife are not speaking to each other like married/partners should. She should not tell you what to do with your sister and you should not tell her it\u2019s none of your business. It is her business. You are married. It\u2019s her SIL. But you and she should have an adult conversation about this instead of her telling you what to do.", "NTA - but it sounds like your wife is cheating or has cheated on you, sorry. Best of Luck.", "This right here, people fuck up and our assholes, but that doesn't mean you have to rip them out of your life. The fact that your wife is asking that of you honestly makes me feel like she doesn't care about how you feel. She should care that you love your sister and want to have her in your life scared your wife making this demand also screams that she thinks she's allowed to give you orders, which isn't right because she's supposed to be your partner, not your superior", "No", "Yeah wtf. Totally bizarre. Maybe she's always disliked SIL?", "\"She does not understand\" ? Wtf does that even mean ? She needs to understand that I care about my sister? What?", "She\u2019s probably just a redditor. The hivemind is usually pretty irrationally angry about cheaters not being shunned."]}
