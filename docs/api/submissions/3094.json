People fuck up. It is human nature. But you are her brother, and she is your sister. You do not have to cut her off or cut her out of your life unless YOU deem it necessary. It is not your wife's place to demand that of you. In fact, I thinks it pretty shitty that she is.", "NTA cheating on someone doesn't mean you should be cut off by your entire family.

Your friend?\n\nIf no to any of those question, then NTA.\n\nIf yes, that might be a different story...", "NTA. There is not reason for you to \u201cpunish\u201d your sister.

Your sister made a mistake and is paying the consequences, she doesn't need any more punishment,  she just needs to know that her family will support her even when she makes mistakes.", "NTA. It's absolutely unreasonable for her to try to control your relationships. I hate cheaters, too, but I'd never demand this of my partner.

A lot.  Clearly it is a common human issue.  Someone may hate it, they can break up with someone for cheating if they feel that way.  That is fully their right.  You know what isn't their right?

Yes, your sister is an AHOLE for cheating, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to cut her off. Your wife made quite the leap from accepting your sister (and not the cheating) to you approving of it to a point that you\u2019re going to do it too.

For you she is still your sister regardless of her infidelity, but i hope your talk really made her understand what cheating does to other people. For your wife i understand her viewpoint as well because cheating on your SO is a very big thing and i can see why she is scared you would do it as well. Talk it out with her and show her that you don\u2019t condone or accept cheating at all", "Everyone here is telling you NTA and i would say that too but I noticed again how differently women are treated. It was the same situation and im not kidding 90% of the comments were telling her that her boyfriend is right and his feelings are valid. I even got downvoted so much because i said that she shouldn\u2019t cut the contact with her sister because she is her sister and they have a good relationship. They were defending her boyfriend so much. Really interesting", "NTA, WTF your sister is WAY out of line to tell you to cut your sister out of your life. This is abusive behaviour. She is trying to separate you from your family", "NTA - my brother was a serial cheater and I got to a point where I started to think I should cut him off because I'd never be friends with someone like that. But I gave it some time and he started getting help. He is on medication now and seeing a therapist and doing much better. He's focusing on his day to day life now instead of looking for the next high. I'm really glad I stuck it out and didn't say anything I would regret. Now that he's gotten professional help, he is also easier to talk to and more down to earth. We can talk about real things now. People can change and grow, and I'm so glad I was there for it.", "NTA the affair cost her her marriage why should it also cost her her brother?  You're taking a decent stance on it.  She'll live with that forever", "Jesus, cutting her out is a bit extreme. Your wife is being unreasonable.", "NTA.  Your relationship with your sister is none of her business.  If she wants to cut her off she can but doesn\u2019t mean you have to.", "NTA\n\nShe cheated on her husband and he\u2019s left her. You can make your disappointment clear without  cutting her out.

Your sister cheating is no indication that you\u2019ll do the same. That was an inappropriate conclusion to jump to on your wife\u2019s part. You were disappointed/angry with your sister and made sure to tell her that. It isn\u2019t like you swept it under the rug.\n\nIf your wife doesn\u2019t want to talk to your sister that\u2019s her own decision. She doesn\u2019t get to decide for you.", "NTA. Yeah your wife is absolutely trying to turn this into a hard line to force you to get rid of your sister because she has a personal issue. Honestly this just sounds like something where you need to press that your wife goes to counseling. She has an issue inside her.

Doubling down and telling her it\u2019s none of her business make you an asshole. She is your wife and you\u2019re acting like you don\u2019t even like her. She has fears and concerns. So talk to her calmly about it.", "ESH. You and your wife are not speaking to each other like married/partners should.

Best of Luck.", "This right here, people fuck up and our assholes, but that doesn't mean you have to rip them out of your life. The fact that your wife is asking that of you honestly makes me feel like she doesn't care about how you feel.

Totally bizarre. Maybe she's always disliked SIL?", "\"She does not understand\" ? Wtf does that even mean ? She needs to understand that I care about my sister?

Instead of taking a soft approach, you blew up at her. That is what makes you an AH.", "NTA Your wife sounds controlling. She thinks it is ok to dictate whether you can associate with your sister. That is a huge red flag. What happened in your sisters marriage has nothing to do with you and your wife. Your wife is the AH for believing she is so saintly that she can judge others.

For one, it's on a seperate whole ass subreddit with its own community and tendencies, and for two it describes a scenario that barely passes muster for comparison here.\n\nIn this context we know nothing about the ex which leaves us to assume they weren't close, and we know nothing about the extent of the cheating. It's something that happened and ended in a divorce without OP finding out until afterwards. The OP doesn't condone the action, but he's not going to write her off for something that isn't anything to him and won't influence shit. It's not like he can tell the dude now that he knows, because her ex already divorced her.\n\nThe post you linked has a remorseless, serial cheater, who at the very beginning of the post blithely makes her sister and boyfriend an accessory to her actions. She also is completely flippant about her actions based off what the OP says. Actions which are ongoing, frequent, and entirely out of spite for the husband for the crime of not being into the party life or highly sexually motivated. The OP also acknowledges they have a close relationship with the sisters husband, which further complicates the matter with betrayal through inaction if they say nothing.\n\nBoth may involve a cheating family member, but beyond that it's an apples to oranges comparison.", "That\u2019s not true. OP covered for her because she thought her sister wants to meet friends and not because she knew that she was cheating you didn\u2019t even read that properly", "It\u2019s the fact that he assume she would also cheat just because her sister cheated. Its basically the same here, his girlfriend thinks that he would also cheat because of what his sister did. His girlfriend is the crazy on? But the boyfriend of this other girl wasn\u2019t crazy? That is my whole point\n\nbtw that was not the post i meant but it\u2019s similar", "Except it's really not comparable.\n\nHe's being accused of wanting to cheat because he won't write off his sister for something he's finding out only after the fact, and for all he knows was a one time offense.\n\nShe's being accused of supporting cheating because she knows her sister is actively carrying out several long term and short term affairs and is doing nothing because, \"my sister will hate me.\" If you knew someone was actively doing something that was or could hurt someone in the long run and you did nothing to stop it when you had full agency to do so you are ultimately part of the problem.\n\nContext does matter.", "ESH. Your wife definitely went too far asking you to cut your sister out. You would have been firmly in N T A territory if you simply refused, but invalidating her insecurities this brought up and telling her it\u2019s none of her business was a step too far by you. I think it\u2019s clear tensions were high during your conversation and hopefully you both can realize you went too far and not let this affect your marriage. \n\nAs ridiculous as it may seem to you, your wife needs reassurance that you in no way condone cheating. Reassuring her and offering an explanation is a better path than berating her and shutting her out. See if you can come to a common ground regarding boundaries with your sister that isn\u2019t so extreme. Also remember you said you normally wouldn\u2019t associate with cheaters.  Your wife doesn\u2019t have the same life long bond with your  sister that would allow her to overlook her transgressions. I think you both need a little more empathy here.", "ESH, while I don't think you need to cut her out, clearly your wife is struggling with this.
