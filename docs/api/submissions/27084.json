If you are close, they should heve met, or?\n\nAlthogh I agree with you, that the arguments of your sister are strange, your niece is already old enough to choose who she wants to invite to her party. So if she doesn't want your foster daughter at her party, because she doesn't know her or maybe doesn't like her, this is okay and nothing to get angry about. You can't force children to like each other. \n\nBut I understand your point, that you are not joining the party if your daughter isn't invited. Lying to her and just don't tell her, where you are going could ruin a lot of her trust in you.

Her concerns have some validity - her daughter doesn\u2019t know yours well, and shouldn\u2019t be forced to invite her.  There also *is* a chance that focus will be on your foster daughter, and not on the birthday girl.  If it\u2019s a tight-knit group of parents, who all know each other, and suddenly you show up with a kid - there will be questions.  If sis doesn\u2019t want her daughter\u2019s party to be the venue where all those questions come up, then that\u2019s valid.", "YTA I understand you want your foster daughter to have broader social interactions but your nieces party is for her. It\u2019s not for you and it\u2019s not for a practice ground for your foster daughter to improve her socialization. Also parties are already stressful and involve coordination and planning, so I can see why your sister doesn\u2019t want to add a kid she and her daughter hardly know to that mix. If you had suggested they have a playdate and your sister had this reaction I would have had a different judgment but your sister was right not to want to add an unknown element to her daughters birthday party.", "If your sister has not met the child yet, I can understand why she would not want her to attend the party.

The focus should be on the birthday girl, and not some random child noone else is going to know at the party besides you. Your edit says it's your niece's friends, and relatives and their kids, so it's likely that your foster child is going to be the only one there with no prior relationship with anyone at that party. You ask what kind of message that it will send to this child that she's not welcome to the party while you go? How about you explain the truth.

They were cousins to my children and my sisters children from the time they were placed in the home of their foster parents. Your sister is an asshole.", "If she\u2019s worried about what people will think\u2026 I have to ask, is this a straight up race thing? Your family and all sisters friends are white and your foster daughter is a person of color? I can\u2019t imagine any of the parents would care at all about a random child being there. She\u2019s concerned with the foster daughter for another reason\n\nEdited for spelling error", "That's a very good idea, i'll reach out to my sister tomorrow and see if she's agreeable to that. The girls have only met once before but hopefully i'll be able to arrange this. Thank you.", "NTA. Please don't risk the progress you've made with your foster daughter. It's a big step for her to have people she feels safe with. Your sister is TA.", "They've met before, only once but have met. My sister didn't even ask my Niece however she simply said no outright.", "It is not only friends going to the party but children within the family.", "They have met yes but only once and my foster daughter is quite shy so while they seemed to get along well enough no immediate friendship was sparked. My niece was not consulted on if she wanted my foster daughter there my sister simply outright said no without asking when I checked in.", "It came off as kinda entitled to expect her niece\u2019s party to be used as the activity for socializing. I\u2019m pretty sure the therapist probably was thinking about a sport, club, or activity that is kinda structured.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like the niece had a problem with it; and if she did it wasn\u2019t specified in the post. OP\u2019s sister claimed she might cause \u201ctrouble\u201d which just sounds like prejudice toward children coming from the foster system. If I was the sister, I\u2019d ask my niece what she thought and go from there, being her party. It\u2019s not an asshole move for OP to ask if her foster daughter can attend her cousin\u2019s party. And since the sister declined; she\u2019s definitely not an asshole for showing solidarity with her daughter and refusing to attend.", "They have met before, my sister has met her a handful of times and my niece has met her once. I agree with you however and she has been being eased into the family slowly she just hasn't met them as often as other relatives as there are ones who live closer.", "Reunification is not on the table for her, I won't expand on the why or give further details as that'd be an invasion of her privacy but she's not going to be returned to her biological family. I very much doubt it's related to race (at least I very much hope it's not) don't worry it's why I hadn't even considered it.", "So, the niece is \"worth\" more than her foster Child?", "Although what you're saying is true, the foster daughter isn't exactly a stranger, it's not the birthday girl's cousin, but not a stranger either since she's living permanently (for now) with her aunt. That's why I think OP's sister should make an effort to at least provide a good climate for the girls to bond and explain all the while, that she could be at her aunt's house for quite long.\n\nNevertheless, the sister just sounds completely prejudiced against the foster daughter and that's something OP shouldn't condone even if that meant not being there on her niece's birthday", "Weird that you compare a pitbull rescue dog to a foster child", "oh absolutely not, i'd be staying for the entire duration of the party if I was there especially if my foster daughter was there.", "That *would* be punishing my niece then, which I am not going to do.", "They have met before which my post says.\n\n> she's met my Foster Daughter and it's not like she has ever caused any trouble before and it's just a horrible way to view a child.", "As the post said my foster daughter is 10 and my niece is turning 9, they are only a year apart in age.", "Foster Child is 10 and niece is 9, if I read correctly", "I actually had never even considered this as a possibility as i'd never have thought my sister would have an issue with this and I *really* hope this isn't the case but my foster daughter is a different ethnicity from us.", "Who questions a new kid at a party? I think you could be right.", "NTA.  I would not jump to this immediately.  It is also possible that sister is used to niece being the special one for OP and now she is not, so she is not having the \u201creplacement\u201d at the party.  She wants OP to be there for niece and not spending the time with the foster daughter.  \n\nMaybe it is time to question sister more about why she could not come.  Throw out the potential reasons and see what is said.", "Or it could be that for someone\u2019s birthday party they want their friends there and not some random person?", "Sad but I bet you may be right.", "your sister is an AH for her reasons, but i personally wouldn\u2019t invite a child my child had only met one time to their birthday party, especially since this seems to be a friends party and not a family party", "We took in 3 fosters a little over a year ago. If anything, we had to have our families slow down a beat because they were so excited to be involved. This birthday party was EXACTLY the kind of situation that would have been perfect. We went to a similar party early on for one of my bio son's classmates. It was a great time, and all the kids had a blast. \n\nNTA, and you did the right thing.\n\nI hope the rest of your family is more welcoming.", "Okay, sounds like your sister is TA here.\n\nBut maybe it is not the worst to not be invited. I myself was a very shy girl and birthday partys with many children, who you hardly know can be hard for a shy child. Because the other kids know each other more and therefor will play mostly with each other, and the shy kid can feel left out by this (just my experience). \n\nSo maybe it could be better for your foster daughter, if you are not going with her to the play area. But instead gift your niece (maybe as part of her gift) a trip to some fun location (zoo, amusement park, cinemas), where you can bring your foster daughter. So it will be just the two girls who can play together and adults who ever you want to take with you. One on one time with other children might be easier tor creating friendships than a whole pool of children all knowing each others already", "I'm sorry for you that your sister is not more supportive. If it were me, I would have reached out and asked you to come to the party with your foster child. Hopefully this will change through time, and she can accept the child as a part of your life, and the family.", "The niece is AS important as the foster child. Why should she miss out when she\u2019s done nothing wrong?", "I don't necessarily agree with the reasons given by the sister, but I think OP is TA to punish her niece because her foster daughter isn't on the guest list.\n\nI understand that it's hurtful and that she wants to include her but all she has to do is organize playdates between the girls and allow them to create a relationship, the attachment is built little by little and she'll surely be invited to the next birthday. And yes, her foster daughter is for the moment a stranger to her niece.", "It's weird the sister is acting like a foster child is dangerous.", "That's what I thought. I'm sorry your sister is putting you in this position.", "Thank you! It does say that idk how I missed it", "I\u2019m just an outsider looking in\u2026 but that\u2019s EXACTLY what it sounds like. Put yourself in her shoes\u2026 would you give a rats behind if she had a new foster daughter there? Now put yourself in the shoes of one of the parents attending nieces party\u2026 would you care if the party throwers sister had a foster kid there? Would you even know she was a foster kid? No, you wouldn\u2019t. \n\nIt almost literally makes no sense at all that she wouldn\u2019t want her there. Even if she didn\u2019t know her at all. There\u2019s no reason to exclude a (your foster) child from a children\u2019s birthday party. Kids don\u2019t care about that kind of thing. And lord knows, if it was an indoor play area, the kids at the party were playing with the other kids at the play place too not just the kids attending the party.", "Yeah, they'll probably assume she's either a classmate or someone the niece knows some other way. If she's with OP, they'll just assume she's her kid.", "OP says that sister was worried about what others would think. I mean, Occam\u2019s razor. What makes most sense, makes most sense. And if that were the case, that she wanted all OPs attention on daughter, then there\u2019s no reason to hide that. That\u2019s not something to lie about. Blatant racism is though. There\u2019s also nothing embarrassing or weird about explaining that a new child in the group is a foster child. But explaining the random black or brown child at an all white party is, to someone that thinks it\u2019s a bad thing.", "It is friends *and* family, if it was only friends that would be a different matter. I understand  why you feel this way though. There aren't many children in the family but two other children in the family are included among my niece's friends.", "I think you hit the nail on the head here with it being racism. If foster daughter is black it would explain why the sister is all worried about problems being caused because often times racists think black people are problem causers/troubled.", "Good eyes.  I didn't even think of that, but as soon as you mentioned it, I thought, \"There it is.\"", "Jumping immediately, too, \"the sister must be a racist\" is a huge stretch. There's absolutely nothing in the post to suggest that.\n\n it sounds more like she has an issue with the foster care aspect than anything else. There are lots of people even today in 2023 that view foster kids as broken traumatized kids that will do nothing but be unhinged and violent or misbehave in major ways due to whatever abuse or situation they're coming from. \n\nMy siblings and I grew up in foster care and I had many friend's parents not like me around simply for the fact I was in foster care and to them that labled me a bad kid with behavioral issues.", "It\u2019s been 4 months and they\u2019ve only met once, your foster daughter isn\u2019t their family", "Sorry but your foster daughter is still closer to stranger category than family category.", "I mean, your Foster daugher isn't family yet. You didn't adopted her and she's only places with you for four months. It's a child your niece doesn't have a relationship yet and I wouldn't invite for a birthday party where your niece is close to the other children. Your daugher can even feel excluded. Don't get me wrong, your sister is definitely a AH and this isn't the reason she didn't invited your Foster daugher so she's being nasty!", "Exactly. And like, I get what one commenter said above of some ppl thinking that foster kids have a lot of issues, I\u2019m not arguing that. But it\u2019s not like the parents at the party would be all \u201chey, who\u2019s that kid? Is she a trouble maker foster kid?\u201d Like, that just would never happen. There\u2019d be literally no reason to explain that she was a foster kid. However, you can\u2019t hide skin color.", "Nta it\u2019s this or sister likes having neice as the only grandkid, neice, or baby of the family. New member means competition", "Sister is worried about appearances for herself having to explain a well behaved child she\u2019s already met before.  Literally none of the parents at the party would give a crap about the others kids there. There\u2019s also nothing at all embarrassing about having a sister who has a foster kid if the parents there were jerks enough to inquire about it. \n\nThe entire post suggests it\u2019s a race thing. Lol", "Personally I don\u2019t find it that odd, depending on how old the niece is. My family always invited other kids to birthday parties in addition to friends up until we were like 11/12. My grandparents would invite neighborhood kids, their friends kids, etc. It was a good way to socialize and make new friends. Though I understand that not everybody is used to that, and kids today are very different with how they socialize. \n\nIf unfamiliarity was the sister\u2019s reasoning it would be fair, but she jumped right to assuming the foster child would cause problems and I think that\u2019s cruel.", "There are plenty of strangers in the play area too.", "Do you know what kind of person refuses to include foster kids in family events because they are foster kids and therefore not family? Assholes. \n\nAnd do you know how people (both adults and children) form relationships with new people? They spend time together \u2013 and arguably, a party with a bunch of kids the same age, at a play place, is a much better way to let a new kid begin to feel comfortable with the family, because there's going to be a lot less attention and pressure than if there are just two kids there; the kids will all be mostly focused on playing (usually with lots of other kids, not just the ones invited to the party).", "One of the most important things we learned doing foster care is that those kids are family. It doesn't matter how long they're with you, they're family. They need that sense of love, acceptance and stability.", "I do agree with you that the Foster daughter is a new person to the family unit.  But I believe the default position should be openness, welcoming, engagement with, and helping of children.\n\nIn the sister's case, her default switch is set at excluding unknown persons.\n\nIt's a matter of embracing the unknown for the right reasons.  It takes maturity, love, some leadership, and selflessness.  Commodities that sister may have in some quantity, but they're trumped by sister's fears.\n\nHence, sister is a big bummer and AH here.", "You are reaching so hard for this to be a race thing. It's really odd. Absolutely nothing in this post even suggests it's about race. You just so badly want it to be.", "Not when you rent it out.", "Exactly this! And foster kids KNOW they\u2019re foster kids, they KNOW they \u201cdon\u2019t belong\u201d and that they\u2019re different and their life experiences and family and living situations are different.", "I Said the sister is an AH. I was thinking the party had only close friends and  kids of the family who are close to the niece. It would be better to build a relationship between the girls First. I don't know the kind of party, but If It is a big party them the circunstances wouldn't apply.", "Yes, you learned this because you did Forster care. That doesn't mean the rest of you family will see this child as family imediately. It takes time. Again, the sister is a big AH who doesn't seem open to this child, I was Just pointing out that If was a private party with only children who are Very close to OP's niece, I would think It was wrong to ask to her Foster child Go. This sister is nasty and I'm not defending her whatsoever and I was correcyed: It is a big party with a bunch of children who don't know each other so OP is right to want her child to Go.", "I\u2019ve explained several times how it does actually\u2026 and in fact, why it makes more sense than any other reason. I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re not capable of reading or comprehending my extremely valid point of view.\n\nI think you may be triggered as a foster child yourself. You want the reason to be because she\u2019s a foster child. And you haven\u2019t given any backup to that other than \u201csome people think\u2026\u201d", "They said that it was a party with a play area. She also points out that there\u2019s no entry fee so it\u2019s not a private play area. Implying that lots of other random kids will be playing on the equipment while they and their parents dine there", "It's an indoor play area that she has rented for the party but it's not like closed down for this, just a party section for them and access to the play area. Individual children coming have to pay but when it's a party they're covered by a booking fee, if it was a per head payment i'd pay her cost but so long as it's under thirty children there is no fee over the payment to have a party."]}
