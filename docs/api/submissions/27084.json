It\u2019s borderline to ask to invite another guest to someone else\u2019s birthday party.

If you are close, they should heve met, or?\n\nAlthogh I agree with you, that the arguments of your sister are strange, your niece is already old enough to choose who she wants to invite to her party. So if she doesn't want your foster daughter at her party, because she doesn't know her or maybe doesn't like her, this is okay and nothing to get angry about. You can't force children to like each other. \n\nBut I understand your point, that you are not joining the party if your daughter isn't invited. Lying to her and just don't tell her, where you are going could ruin a lot of her trust in you. Your sister should know that.\n\nSo best is, accept your sister and or niece decission to nt invite your foster daughter - as some kind of 'they don't know each other that well and maybe it looks completly different next year'.

And is resentful that you now have a family of your own to focus on.", "NAH\n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for not wanting to make your foster daughter feel bad by going to a party she is excluded from.\n\nYour sister isn\u2019t an AH for wanting her daughter\u2019s party to be about her daughter.  Her concerns have some validity - her daughter doesn\u2019t know yours well, and shouldn\u2019t be forced to invite her.  There also *is* a chance that focus will be on your foster daughter, and not on the birthday girl.  If it\u2019s a tight-knit group of parents, who all know each other, and suddenly you show up with a kid - there will be questions.  If sis doesn\u2019t want her daughter\u2019s party to be the venue where all those questions come up, then that\u2019s valid.", "YTA I understand you want your foster daughter to have broader social interactions but your nieces party is for her. It\u2019s not for you and it\u2019s not for a practice ground for your foster daughter to improve her socialization. Also parties are already stressful and involve coordination and planning, so I can see why your sister doesn\u2019t want to add a kid she and her daughter hardly know to that mix. If you had suggested they have a playdate and your sister had this reaction I would have had a different judgment but your sister was right not to want to add an unknown element to her daughters birthday party.", "If your sister has not met the child yet, I can understand why she would not want her to attend the party.

The lack of invite is probably not related to race, but may be related to her foster status. Your foster kid\u2019s behavior could be more out there for kids her age than you seem to think.

Your sister could think that her daughter\u2019s birthday party is not a good place for test socialization/therapy homework for your foster kid.

While I get that your foster child needs socialization with other children, your niece's birthday party is NOT the time or place. The focus should be on the birthday girl, and not some random child noone else is going to know at the party besides you. Your edit says it's your niece's friends, and relatives and their kids, so it's likely that your foster child is going to be the only one there with no prior relationship with anyone at that party. You ask what kind of message that it will send to this child that she's not welcome to the party while you go? How about you explain the truth.
