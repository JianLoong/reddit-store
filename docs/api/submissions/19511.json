Some people (like me) can\u2019t handle the silence but doesn\u2019t mean I get to take over ever it feels icky yucky \n\nThere are times when we advocate for each other and it\u2019s a time where we know one has a strength in that area and its \u201cus against them\u201d situation to get something done \u2014- however this is so far from OPs situation", "I dunno about \u201cgood intentions,\u201d he has said he has had multiple conversations with her about it telling her he doesn\u2019t appreciate her doing that, all sympathy is lost beyond the second time he has to ask her; first is okay, she didn\u2019t know, second is still acceptable imo, maybe she needed a reminder about the behaviour.\n\nI would like to believe she perhaps started off with good intentions, but digging her heels in like this kind of sours that notion.\n\n>\u201dOh, Secure_Stress_8395 doesn\u2019t really get these kinds of movies, I guess he\u2019s not very emotionally sensitive\u201d\n\nThe way that reads, personally, is that what she _really_ means is \u201che\u2019s not as emotionally sensitive _as me_\u201d. It sounds like she\u2019s trying to better herself image-wise by encouraging notions about OP that make him look worse. That doesn\u2019t read anything like an overzealous girlfriend who thinks she knows her bf so well that she can read his thoughts.

If they didn\u2019t know for certain what you were thinking, why would they then act like they did?\n\nAnd besides, why would he not be allowed to correct her _on himself?_ If him being \u201cunemotional and hard-hearted\u201d is a common misconception about him that he doesn\u2019t like, why is he not allowed to then correct his _girlfriend_ when she is then spreading that falsity about _himself?_", "Wtf? Hardly came for an excuse to break up", "She shouldn't be speaking for him in the first place, though.

It was made clear that being private about it wasn\u2019t going to change anything, so he had to approach the situation differently.\n\nAnd, yknow what? I don\u2019t blame him for being pissed at her. Again, he had told her multiple times that, no, he doesn\u2019t appreciate her talking on his behalf, and this time she does so _perpetuating a belief about him that he actively doesn\u2019t like because it\u2019s **not true**??_ In that case, she would be a liar\u2013 she\u2019s actively perpetuating the narrative that OP is hard-hearted when he isn\u2019t.\n\nAlso, do tell how you think he\u2019s hypocritical for calling her a liar.
