She continues to not only make broad, assumptive statements about you and your opinions or feelings in public, but that last comment was outright insulting.  I'd have been pissed too.  And yes, at this point, she is a liar.  People out here splitting hairs about the definition of the word liar... You've asked her to stop, because shes wrong.  She didn't stop.  She is, in fact, willfully sharing things she has to at least suspect you won't like because they are untrue.  At the very least, she's rude, dismissive, and condescending.   I'm sorry your dealing with it.", "NTA\n\nYou attempted to talk to her in private, rather than correcting her in front of others and embarrassing her. \n\nThe amount of people making excuses for her like she has the memory of a goldfish or something is...really surprising.

She is unable to remember private conversations where you stated your feelings and continues to do something that you've expressed makes you unhappy. And you tried to do that in a way that doesn't call negative attention to her from the others around her.

What I was really thinking is so-and-so.\" They'd get embarrassed, but not as mad as yr GF is.\n\nAnd unfortunately, now she'll just remember your calling her a liar, and not think yr anger has anything to do with her behavior.\n\nThese kind of people are irritating and frustrating and I'm doubtful they can ever change.
