Digesting food is a process of breaking down chemicals like sugars into simpler and simpler forms, and we produce specialized chemicals called enzymes which specially fit with different sugars and whatever and help pull them apart.  When we are babies, we produce lactase enzymes to help pull apart the lactose in our mother's milk, and as we get older and are weaned, we stop producing it, and by between two and five years old, when we stop nursing, we don't produce lactase, and don't drink milk any more.  Without lactase, our bodies can still use their other enzymes to try to pull apart those sugars, but do a bad job, and leave lots of extra molecules lying around, which end up as various gases like carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and methane.  This inflates our intestines, as if by a bicycle pump, which hurts like hell and has all sorts of other effects that you would expect from pumping up your intestines.\n\nWell, that is how it used to work, anyway.  And still does for most people.  But around eight thousand years ago, some people started hanging on to the ability to produce lactase on their own, even after they were toddlers.  Even into their teen years.  Sometimes all the way through their teens.\n\nIn fact, there are groups of people from Northern and Western Europe who never stop producing lactase for their entire lives, but they are relatively rare.\n\nUnfortunately, those relatively rare Northern and Western Europeans ended up being culturally dominant over a lot of cultures, and believe that their weird mutation is \"normal\", and set up situations which, in effect, \"punish\" people for not having that mutation.\n\nUsually, that is simple ignorance, and being unaware that this happens.  But if those European-descended people (or some other places, too - it didn't ONLY happen in Europe) know that people don't have the adult lactose tolerance mutation and try to make people eat lactose in order to make their body work around it - and, remember, the workaround is to produce lots of byproduct gases and inflate our guts - they are being terrible human beings.\n\nYou yelled at a person who deliberately harmed you by deception.  She physically hurt you, on purpose, \"for your own good.\"  Morally, that is in the same general area as physical abuse.

But I can be quite vindictive \ud83d\ude01", "Organic is generally about as healthy as conventional, maybe slightly less due to worse pesticides that are more toxic and less effective. It's just overpriced and sold to people with more money than sense.", "I call it the stupid tax \ud83e\udd23", "So right!\n\nI can't believe people still fall for it. They back themselves into proverbial corners with the logic on this scam.\n\nUsually good food though as it's often produced in smaller quantities with less chemical input but really it's not what they think it is lol.", "That said, as one other commenter noted, there are cases where the organic food actually is better because of factors which go along with organic farming practices.  Pasture-raised eggs and milk taste better, because the milk and eggs the chickens and cows produce are made out of what they eat, and the greater variety of things, the better overall.  The egg I eat from a pasture raised chicken was made from mostly the same corn chicken feed that is the main source of calories for chickens raised indoors or outdoors, but also has some grass, flowers, snails, worms, ants, and other bugs in it, which makes it much richer in flavor.\n\nNot any healthier, and way more expensive, but pasture-raised eggs and milk is my luxury treat.", "When a lactose intolerant person consumes lactose, the attempt to digest lactose without the use of lactase leaves a vast amount of excess carbon dioxide and other gases which inflate the intestines like a balloon.  And, yes, intestines have pain receptors.\n\nThe fact that this typically resolves on its own without significant lasting damage doesn't mean it doesn't hurt like fuck, or that it doesn't matter.  Waterboarding typically resolves without long-term health consequences, either, but that doesn't make it not torture.", "It's not fair to say it's the intolerants who suck - it's the intolerance they suffer from.", "Yeah there is literally nobody policing the \"organic\" label. That said, I don't think it's healthy to have products that are full of steroids, hormones, and antibiotics. I try to buy local from farmers with a reputation for avoiding that stuff.\n\nYou can wash insecticide off plants, but if the cow is getting something pumped into it there is no way to remove that from the milk or meat. Same with chickens and pigs.", "Ops thanks for catching the typo", "Your comparison only makes sense in the case of severe allergies. \n\nMy friend is allergic to dairy and it makes her eyes water. \n\nI\u2019m lactose intolerant and a reaction will leave me in agony (and off work in bed) for at least two days. \n\nIf someone knowingly gave me something that would make me Ill and miss two days of pay, I think shouting at them would be appropriate."]}
