Digesting food is a process of breaking down chemicals like sugars into simpler and simpler forms, and we produce specialized chemicals called enzymes which specially fit with different sugars and whatever and help pull them apart.  When we are babies, we produce lactase enzymes to help pull apart the lactose in our mother's milk, and as we get older and are weaned, we stop producing it, and by between two and five years old, when we stop nursing, we don't produce lactase, and don't drink milk any more.  Without lactase, our bodies can still use their other enzymes to try to pull apart those sugars, but do a bad job, and leave lots of extra molecules lying around, which end up as various gases like carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and methane.  This inflates our intestines, as if by a bicycle pump, which hurts like hell and has all sorts of other effects that you would expect from pumping up your intestines.\n\nWell, that is how it used to work, anyway.  And still does for most people.  But around eight thousand years ago, some people started hanging on to the ability to produce lactase on their own, even after they were toddlers.  Even into their teen years.  Sometimes all the way through their teens.\n\nIn fact, there are groups of people from Northern and Western Europe who never stop producing lactase for their entire lives, but they are relatively rare.\n\nUnfortunately, those relatively rare Northern and Western Europeans ended up being culturally dominant over a lot of cultures, and believe that their weird mutation is \"normal\", and set up situations which, in effect, \"punish\" people for not having that mutation.\n\nUsually, that is simple ignorance, and being unaware that this happens.  But if those European-descended people (or some other places, too - it didn't ONLY happen in Europe) know that people don't have the adult lactose tolerance mutation and try to make people eat lactose in order to make their body work around it - and, remember, the workaround is to produce lots of byproduct gases and inflate our guts - they are being terrible human beings.\n\nYou yelled at a person who deliberately harmed you by deception.  She physically hurt you, on purpose, \"for your own good.\"  Morally, that is in the same general area as physical abuse.

Lactose is a short chain carbohydrate that (among other short chain carbohydrates) we frequently lose the ability to digest as we age.\n\nIn fact, many people lose the ability to digest short chain carbohydrates and just don't make the connection because of the type of food upsetting their stomachs--oh, I'm just too old to eat onions, maybe I'm gluten intolerant, don't beans make everyone painfully gassy? They chalk it up to IBS when it's the types of sugars (collectively referred to as FODMAPs).\n\nLactaid pills can help, or FODZYME. FODZYME isn't cheap, though, and is better suited to people with issues with multiple types of sugars. Please note you need to finish eating within 30 minutes of taking the enzyme or take another one. The enzyme helps digest lactose.\n\nEating more dairy without enzymes does not increase tolerance. It increases inflammation and increases the risk of damage to your intestines, including diverticulosis.", "Soft NTA, because screaming still wasn't the right reaction, but what your mom did wasn't cool either. \n\nSince a lot of comments mention how common it is to develop lactose intolerance later in life, I think it's important to also note that your mother may be somewhat correct as well, and it's quite frankly too soon to say. This may be a permanent thing for you, but it also might not be. Your food poisoning may have harmed your gut bacteria in ways that are long-lasting but not permanent. When my best friend was about your age, she developed an intolerance to a number of things, including dairy/cheese, to the point that she had severe pain after ingesting even the smallest amounts. She saw plenty of doctors about it, and even had surgery to have her gallbladder removed, none of which helped. She suffered with it for years, but it slowly went away (possibly aided by her consumption of probiotic products and continued minor consumption of the foods in question over the years), and she can now consume whatever she wants with no issues.

If your body still produces a little lactase then you might be able to digest a little lactose and therefore a little dairy.\n\nYou can also consume a lactase enzyme supplement when you are lactose intolerant and still want to consume some dairy. You take the supplement when you consume anything that contains lactose. When you consume more lactose you also need to take more lactase in order to digest it properly.\n\n\nHaving an allergy is something very different from an intolerance. When you have an allergic reaction you actually have an immune response and it can be V damaging and dangerous and even lethal. The only similarity between an intolerance and an allergic reaction is that both can have gastric symptoms like stomach pains, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. The difference in gastric symptoms lies in the fact that with an intolerance the gastric symptoms are often only temporary and usually have no lasting effect and usually do no lasting harm (though it is possible sometimes, like for exampe getting (temporary) hemmoroids from severe diarrhea). After an allergic reaction there can be damage and dysfunction to the gastric system and other functions of the body for days, weeks and even months.\n\n\n\nI am allergic to cowmilk protein myself so I definitely know what I am talking about.", "Actually you are correct.
