They are pretty close and she was a bridesmaid for our wedding. Recently another friend invited them to go to Italy to their family\u2019s vineyard as their family was going to Spain for the month. So accommodations are free but the flight, food etc were extra. They left for 2 weeks. \n\nI was not aware of this trip until a month before it was suppose to happen(they booked it 2 months out). Recently I lost my job and had to get another one. It pays around half what my job originally did (120k>66k). My wife only has cashier experience and barely makes more money than it would be worth it for her to work as we have 2 kids (4 and 1). My wife isn\u2019t the best with money, she does spend without thinking and she agreed to this trip without telling me. She had to beg her mom to look after the kids after she said yes to the trip and her friends booked the tickets. Her mom is from another city and came to live with me for 2 weeks as I had to work and couldn\u2019t take care of them when I\u2019m working.\n\nI was extremely mad at her but allowed her to go as I know she\u2019s been depressed since the baby and it was too late anyway. She asked her friend to cover her for the flight and she would pay her back. I knew it was hard for us to pay her friend back but it was a non refundable anyway.\n\nShe came back from the trip very happy until her friend asked for the flights. She had spent $1400 on the trip not including the flight and her friend wanted the $1200 that was the cost of the flight that she had put onto her credit card. We had $300 left in our account and already have credit card debt. We are thinking of downsizing our house to an apartment but it\u2019s hard because as soon as landlords hear that we have kids they don\u2019t want to talk anymore. It really sucks but I told her we can\u2019t pay her friend back until I get a better job.\n\nIt\u2019s been 3 months since the trip and her friend is getting angry because she promised to pay it back and we no longer have money. It\u2019s not like her friend needs the money back, she makes six figures and has a house already, she\u2019s not struggling. I told my wife we don\u2019t have enough to pay her back and she will have to explain to her friend. They clearly did not have a good conversation as her friend blocked her and told their other friends about her refusing to pay her back. She cried and is mad at me for losing my job (I was laid off I had no choice) and ruining her friendship by not pulling money out of my ass to pay her friend. I got mad at her and told her to get a job at night then because I\u2019m trying my best.", "created_utc": 1699049920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17n6ozb/aita_for_ruining_my_wifes_friendship/", "score": 421, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If not, your wife should give her friend the money from another job, like you said. That would be a good financial lesson.\n\nRegardless, it's clear that this friend is never going to trust her again, and I don't blame them...", "I was very set to go YTA when I first started reading this. Saying things like you 'allowed her to go' and acting it would automatically be her salary that would be equated to childcare costs and be expected to cover those costs. It sounds like you're in a really serious financial position though and I cannot understand her going on an expensive trip when you are in this situation. However overall NTA. I appreciate she has depression but you guys can't magic money out of thin air and if you could it should be spent on providing for your kids not luxury holidays. Your wife absolutely should have asked the cost of the flight before agreeing to go.", "NTA\n\nHer not paying her friend back isn't your fault.\n\nIt's her fault for agreeing to something she couldn't afford.\n\nYour wife ruined her own friendship, not you.\n\nThat she's mad at you for getting laid off is really telling about the type of person she is, what she thinks of you, and what she considers your role in this relationship to be. You aren't there to be loved by her, you're there to financially support her.", "NTA, but your wife is. Is there no option for her to make money doing a side gig to get this paid for? Like if she did rover for a couple months, or even set up a payment plan with her friend and paid her back in small increments? She should\u2019ve been straight up with her friend from the beginning that money is tight. Friends should never lend money unless they\u2019re willing to accept that they may not get it back.", "NTA - let\u2019s get this straight: YOU didn\u2019t agree to an international trip without discussing it with your spouse. YOU didn\u2019t spring it on your spouse only a month before you let them with their mother-in-law and two children to juggle, while also working a new job and struggling with newer finances. YOU didn\u2019t beg a friend to cover a significant amount of $ for you and promise to pay it back, while knowing your family really didn\u2019t have the money for any of it.\n\nSo\u2026 YOU didn\u2019t ruin the friendship, SHE did.", "NTA, your wife's poor decision making skills and lack of money management is what caused the falling out between her and her friends. You played no role in the whole ordeal.", "ESH, good lord.\n\nYour wife has been an AH to everyone in this situation - to you, to her mother, to her friend. Let's be clear here: YOU didn't ruin her friendship. She did that by promising to pay her friend back when she knew damn well yall didn't have the money for that. It sounds like she has a pattern of impulse spending and poor financial self-control. She needs to deal with that. Do you guys talk about financials regularly? Does she know how much is coming in and how much is going out, and for what? I'd strongly suggest getting a budgeting app you can both use together - YNAB is my app of choice, it's worked well for me for years - so there's full transparency, and literally having a scheduled budget meeting on a weekly basis to go over it.\n\nHowever, you're making a lot of assumptions about what her friend does or doesn't need, and you're apparently just fine with not even trying to pay her back because \"she's not struggling\", which is a huge AH move. I make six figures and own a home, but $1400 still isn't pocket change to me and I'd be pretty pissed if I loaned someone that much and then they were just like oops can't repay you guess you're shit out of luck! What her friend does or doesn't need, or whether she's \"struggling\" or not, is not up to you to decide with an outsider's eyes. There may be shit going on you don't know about. You know what it's called when a person takes another person's money and then refuses to give it back? THEFT. Which you are apparently fine with condoning if the person doesn't \"need it\" according to your personal judgment of their life.\n\nAnd frankly, I'm not sure I'd quite call the friend an AH, but she was an idiot to loan that kind of money to a friend. Never loan a friend or family member money you can't live with not getting back.\n\nYou and your wife both need to sit down, possibly with a financial counselor (check with your bank or credit union as some offer that as a service, or check with your HR to see if your employer offers an EAP, as that often includes financial coaching as well), and recalibrate your entire way of thinking about finances, or else you're not getting out of this hole anytime soon.", "NTA, she ruined the relationship herself. She knew perfectly well that she couldn't afford the trip, borrowed money, and promised to pay it back. She should have discussed the situation with her friend before asking for the money and agreed on a repayment plan before the trip.\n\nThis was her decision; it's not your responsibility to fix her mistakes. Your suggestion that she should find a job to pay off the debt is valid, and it would be beneficial to have a second income while improving your financial situation.", "NTA. However Y T A for refusing to pay the $1200 back based on your comments, simply bc your wife\u2019s friend \u201cdoesn\u2019t need it,\u201d and how \u201cbadly she treated your wife.\u201d\n\nShe treated her as she should!! She paid for the flight under the circumstances that your wife would pay her back - and your wife knew neither of you could. That\u2019s SO shitty. You having kids and her being better off financially doesn\u2019t change that. \n\nYour wife dug the two of you into this hole, she needs to dig you out and learn to be more responsible with money", "You and your wife are both assholes. She is clearly financially irresponsible and she shouldn\u2019t have gone on that trip while she can\u2019t afford it. She promised to pay the friend back and $1200 is a lot of money unless you are a billionaire. But even then if you promised to do something it\u2019s an asshole move to not follow through. \n\nOp, you are an asshole because even though you think someone lives comfortably you don\u2019t get to decide they don\u2019t need the money. I\u2019m pretty sure the friend worked hard so they can do a huge favor for your wife and pay for her ticket. \nHow about we flip this around and say the friend doesn\u2019t care about you having kids and your wife\u2019s cashier job?", "In my opinion you are NTA.\n1. your wife should have talked with you before she booked the trip.\n2. your wife should not have spent that much money if she/you can't afford it.\n3. it is not your fault that their friendship is ruined. Your wife should not have made a promise, she could not keep.", "ESH both of you are in your 30s, have kids, and are just financially-bumbling thieves? \n\nYour wife stole her friend's money and you're encouraging her to do that. She deserves to have her friendships nuked, but honestly it sounds like she needs a therapist and a financial advisor because she's making almost-intentionally poor decisions. You recognize she's depressed and instead of getting her mental health care, you agree she should go on a trip you can't afford, knowing you'll struggle to pay back the friend?\n\nY'all both needs second jobs since you can't keep your expenses in line with your current incomes.", "NTA - Classic case of \"don't cash a check your tush can't bounce\".\n\nIf she wasn't paying attention to the finances, that's on her. She's coming off as extremely entitled and bratty.", "Nta. You didn't choose to lose your job, and it was really disrespectful for your wife to plan to go on the trip without even discussing it with you. As far as the friend goes, it's understandable she wants to be paid back if that was the agreement. However, if you don't have it then you don't have it. In my opinion your wife was really selfish to pick such a lavish trip over the financial well-being of her family.", "YTA for admitting in the comments that you refusing to ever pay the friend back because you're pissed she outed your wife as a liar to their friends. You realize she can probably take you to smalls claims court over this right? Obviously your wife is the biggest asshole here, but you are too for how you're handling this", "You guys need to give her small amounts of the money if she wants to salvage her relationship. 50-100 bucks at least monthly.", "If your wife works and even barely makes more than it would cost to cover child care,  that's still something more.  She needs to take responsibility for creating this situation.  Even if she only sends her ex friend a small amount monthly,  it's still something.  She may only have a small amount of experience,  but she won't gain any more by not working.  If you got a fabulous new job next month that covered everything,  it's still no guarantee that things will always be peachy.  She needs to have some experience and options in case of financial emergency.", "NTA. You're not the asshole for losing your job, as it was beyond your control. It's understandable that you're facing financial difficulties, and your wife should have communicated with you about the trip and its expenses beforehand. Her friend's reaction seems unfair, given her financial situation, but your wife should have been upfront with her. It's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your wife about the financial challenges and find a solution together that works for both of you.", "She shouldn't have gone on the trip, the fact is that neither of you could afford it. She should have discussed this with you before any tickets were bought. It's time for you and her to have a serious conversation about this, and don't let her put blame on you. She fucked up her friendships for a stupid vacation. Your wife needs to get a job and start payment plans, though I don't think her friendships will ever be the same again. NTA", "ESH She knew that the money was not there and spent 3K on the trip anyway. You were laid off and the kids were sent off to grandma's. She should not have gone on that trip at that time.\n\nYTA for counting her friend's money. It was a loan and not a gift, so you should not be complaining that the friend is rich, etc. Your wife is a grown woman and made the choice to splurge on this trip.  It sounds as though your wife is trying to keep up with the Joneses but you are broke. Friend deserves her money back. Wife needs to work out some sort of arrangement with the friend, even if it's $20 a week, in good faith.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't ruin your wife's friendship. She did that all on her own by taking money from her friend knowing that she wasn't going to be able to pay her back. You are not in the wrong here. Not only did she plan a trip and didn't even ask you about it, she hid it from you for a month. It's her fault. The responsible decision would have been to not go on the trip at all.", "YTA for this: \" It\u2019s not like her friend needs the money back, she makes six figures and has a house already, she\u2019s not struggling.\"  So promises are nothing? Your wife went on an expensive trip she knew she couldn't afford and you both decided it's ok to just not even attempt to pay back the friend because she has money?  \n\nHow hard is it to explain the situation and set up a payment plan - even $10-$25 a week would show you're both making a good-faith effort!", "NTA. YOU didn't ruin her friendship - she did. And seriously damaged her relationship with you. Even if she did have her own money, you talk about trips like this before deciding to go.", "ESH - except the friend.  She should have never gone on the trip.   You should pay the friend back.  It doesn't matter whether the friend needs the money or not, 1200 is a shit ton of money and stealing is wrong (that's what it is when you borrow money and don't pay it back, it's called stealing).  You need to have a discussion with the friend and make a payment plan that is doable, not say \"oh too bad, so sad, you're rich it doesn't matter\".", "NTA she needs to figure out the money to pay. She wanted this trip and now she has to pay it back. She knew before agreeing that you were making less. She blaming you for her own poor decision and it's consequences.", "NTA for the trip, but c'mon on the whole \"they make enough to pay for it\" garbage. It was over a k, and it was a loan. Of course the person is going to be pissed and have every right to be.", "YTA based on your response to comments. You can\u2019t never pay the friend back just because she\u2019s better off then you and rightfully called your wife out.", "ESH. I get you're stressed but you do need to pay back that friend of hers. And Y'all need a come to Jesus talk about finances and lock down spending.\n\nAnd YOU need to reach out to the friend regarding payment. They've MORE than likely heard a different story than what you've said here. Clear the air. \n\nIf you are blocked on social media? Find a friend of the friend and hand over a letter.\n\nExplain that you were unaware of the travel plans (they may've thought you were on board with it). That you were trying to make the best of it. \n\nWife needs to acknowledge the debt. To acknowledge she fricked up. And to apologize for such recklessness. Both to you, and to her friend(s). And you both do need to find a way to pay friend back. Maybe not immediately, but $1200 is a lot of money. Even just sitting down to discuss a payment plan would help. You don't want that hanging over you forever (especially if she has proof it was intended to be paid back).\n\nYOU did not ruin the friendship, SHE did with her decisions. But since you are married, the debt is shared here (since it sounds like you have shared finances), since it sounds like repayment was agreed upon with both of you and now you're wanting to back out.\n\nThe friends have played this game before. This was just the last straw for them, I can practically guarantee. I've paid for friends before under the guise that they couldn't afford it, only to realize they had money (e.g. here, the $1400 spent overseas), and didn't have any intentions to pay me back in any reasonable timeframe (if at all) because I had \"more\" and could \"afford it\". Never again.\n\nSeriously, though. I get you're stressed. You are allowed to be stressed and frustrated and angry. Feel those (valid!) emotions. \n\nBest of luck.", "NTA\nYour wife ruined her own friendship. She's an adult and should budget better. Not your fault she didn't plan well and spent so much money. She should be paying for all of it, time for a job!", "NTA. Your financial position right now is not your fault, and there is only so far your money can go. Your wife shouldn't have borrowed money she could not afford to pay back. Imagine going on a trip like this, knowing your financial position and having two little people mouths to feed as well. This will hopefully be a learning lesson for your wife.", "If anything I believe this post belongs in r/relationshipadvice. Clearly anybody sane reading this would say NTA, your wife signed up for this and made her own promises and put all her bets on you.", "Your  wife\u2019s friend is NTA, and it is your wife who is ruining this friendship.

She put her own selfish wants before your family\u2019s well being. This is extremely irresponsible behavior especially since you have young children.

They are pretty close and she was a bridesmaid for our wedding. Recently another friend invited them to go to Italy to their family\u2019s vineyard as their family was going to Spain for the month. So accommodations are free but the flight, food etc were extra. They left for 2 weeks. \n\nI was not aware of this trip until a month before it was suppose to happen(they booked it 2 months out). Recently I lost my job and had to get another one. It pays around half what my job originally did (120k>66k). My wife only has cashier experience and barely makes more money than it would be worth it for her to work as we have 2 kids (4 and 1). My wife isn\u2019t the best with money, she does spend without thinking and she agreed to this trip without telling me. She had to beg her mom to look after the kids after she said yes to the trip and her friends booked the tickets. Her mom is from another city and came to live with me for 2 weeks as I had to work and couldn\u2019t take care of them when I\u2019m working.\n\nI was extremely mad at her but allowed her to go as I know she\u2019s been depressed since the baby and it was too late anyway. She asked her friend to cover her for the flight and she would pay her back. I knew it was hard for us to pay her friend back but it was a non refundable anyway.\n\nShe came back from the trip very happy until her friend asked for the flights. She had spent $1400 on the trip not including the flight and her friend wanted the $1200 that was the cost of the flight that she had put onto her credit card. We had $300 left in our account and already have credit card debt. We are thinking of downsizing our house to an apartment but it\u2019s hard because as soon as landlords hear that we have kids they don\u2019t want to talk anymore. It really sucks but I told her we can\u2019t pay her friend back until I get a better job.\n\nIt\u2019s been 3 months since the trip and her friend is getting angry because she promised to pay it back and we no longer have money. It\u2019s not like her friend needs the money back, she makes six figures and has a house already, she\u2019s not struggling. I told my wife we don\u2019t have enough to pay her back and she will have to explain to her friend. They clearly did not have a good conversation as her friend blocked her and told their other friends about her refusing to pay her back. She cried and is mad at me for losing my job (I was laid off I had no choice) and I got mad at her and told her to get a job then because I\u2019m trying my best.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are looking at her from the outside, just like she is you. The friend didn't know that your wife couldn't actually pay her. The friend probably thinks you guys are fine and are purposefully not paying her back. I doubt she believes you have money problems.", "Maybe don\u2019t have kids if you can\u2019t afford them then?", "Her friend probably isn\u2019t struggling because she\u2019s responsible with her money. That doesn\u2019t mean she should cover your wife\u2019s vacation. I think you both are the As here.", "So your wife needs to be more responsible with money and you should have helped her. Trying to use your kids as a reason to not pay the friend back isn't much of an excuse as your kids aren't the friends responsibility.\n\nYou're lucky the amount isn't large enough for you to get into legal problems. In fact you're lucky you aren't facing any legal reprecussions due to your wife. What's stopping her for maxing the credit card to the limit?", "Do what you can when you can.  Make the promise to the friend then be a laser focused hard ass about your finances and dig out of this hole.  Do it with her or without her.  \n\nBe determined. Be ethical.  Dog out. Pay it back.\n\nYou are not the AH. I just think being righteously angry at the friend feels better than losing your shit on your wife.", "Your wife sucks. SHE ruined her friendship, not you.", "You need to talk to her about that habit. It\u2019s a very dangerous mindset to have regarding finances. She needs to work within your means now, not what she thinks your means will be later.\n\nMy mother always told me to only ever make plans for the money I have today, not the money I think I\u2019ll have tomorrow.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if you know for sure the money is coming (like a Christmas bonus), but it\u2019s a different thing entirely to just assume the funds (or a better job) will just materialize out of thin air when you need them to. It\u2019s like banking on an inheritance: great if it comes; but you shouldn\u2019t rely on receiving it so much that you\u2019re living outside your means or organizing your life around it before you even have it.", ">She thought I would make more by then\n\nShe expected you to scrounge up a new high-paying job in a month? Those jobs don't just hang on trees, and if they did she should go get one herself. Your wife acted highly irresponsibly here, and I think you're aware of that.", "You and your wife need to make an appointment with a financial advisor or a financial counselor of some sort. She has to accept what your financial situation is and she has to learn how to budget and plan based on your current income, not your past income or what she hopes your future income will be. Check with your local library to see if they have a list of free or low cost services in your area.", "Why can\u2019t your wife get a job? Or is she too good for those fast food jobs?", "She better get a job, then.\n\nSeriously. This is her debt. She's destroying her own friendship by taking on personal debt she will not find a way to pay.\n\nIf childcare is an issue, she can look for a weekend/evening job or Uber after your day is done. If she won't, that shows how little she prioritizes this relationship.\n\nI think ESH because you shouldn't have greenlit this trip knowing your family has no spare funds for leisure, but you are not the one whose actions jeopardized her friendship. Your wife did that when she asked her friend to cover her.", "Your wife is very immature.  \n\nSell your stuff so you can pay your mortgage.  If you have car payments, see if your can swap one for a car you can actually afford.  \n\nYou are in bad financial straits it is made worse by her immaturity.", "Tell her to get off her ass and go to work", "Wow, how old is she ??? 15?", "Wow. Budgets be damned, I guess? Even I\u2019m not the best with money, but it\u2019s also just me. If I A. Had a family/kids to provide for/consider in my finances, or even just B. Had a serious partner to where my financial choices don\u2019t just affect me, I\u2019d have more sense than this. \n\nIt\u2019s not like if you WERE making more money by then, that you guys would have actually been able to afford it. That\u2019s such a huge luxury/leisure expense! The type that you put away money for over time so that you CAN even do it in the first place.", "That\u2019s not YOUR problem. You shouldn\u2019t have to make more money for HER to go on trips and have you pay for it.", "What kind of entitlement is this? Your wife is the worst, my guy. This interaction would be a deal breaker for me. Especially in today's economy.", "Yeah but his wife doesn't make money, so eventually it relied on OP I guess? Either way, she chose to make her friend pay (she originally chose that so OP wouldn't find out the price).\n\nI agree that her friend's financial situation is irrilevant tho, I just think that it was added so nobody would suggest his wife to explain their situation, since they already did", "Oops, carry on - I'm in total agreement", "The friend still probably could\u2019ve had that money added to a travel bank instead", "Then you could have taken the $1200 that was on the card and sent it to her friend for the flight. And used $200 of your $300 to pay her off. \n\nYou had options. But you agreed for her to go.", "This exactly.", "They both did! My husband would NEVER let me spend or borrow money we don\u2019t have depressed or not! That\u2019s when you get therapy and medication not go on a spending spree with her friends money! Oh and stop reproducing!", "Here's a solution for the overspending instead of using credit cards which I get can be useful for like points and stuff but use cash. Like sit down and plan out meals for the week and then plan out the night before you go grocery shopping and only take that amount of cash to the store plus like 15-20bucks extra just in case. \n\nSecond use cash for little fun money like depending on your budget like $50 a month for each of you and $50 for the kids that money can be spend or saved by the induvial but they do what they want with it. This will also be good for the kids(they want to go out to the movies, or out with friends for something they use only that money). \n\nShe's shown she cannot be an adult with a credit card so she gets budgeted cash.", "They addressed that.  His wife only has cashier skills and she would barely make what it would cost in daycare for her to go to work.", "Depending on how many kids are involved, they\u2019ll probably spend more on childcare than she would even bring home. Doesn\u2019t make much sense to shell out $400 a week ($200 per week, per kid) when you bring home $400.\n\nETA: changed math because he said how many kids they have", "The cost of daycare for a 4 and 1 year old would be WAY more than she'd make working minimum wage.", "You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions about their current expenses, you don\u2019t know what kind of car they drive or if they have a car at all. From the English phrasing and the remark about landlords being able to deny a lease because they have kids, they might not be in the states. It sounds like they didn\u2019t buy a house, rather are currently renting a house and trying to downsize to an apartment. \n\nYes the wife is immature and no she\u2019s not helping but your advice was about ask useful as the wife\u2019s spending habits.", "No totally unrefundable. I checked because if her friends could get credit I would have made her cancel it", "And if he'd said no, everyone on here would be yelling \"CoNtRoLlInG!\" at him.", "Fair enough. I probably should have if I was smarter and not interested in hearing my wife cry and tell me I was an asshole.", "They both did? Nah this is solely on her.", "She hid it from him for a whole month, how is he supposed to dissuade her when everything is already paid ? Limiting the loss by not letting her go would have been smarter money wise but how is it his fault ?", "She spent it without telling him and it was non refundable. It's all on her. Well, originally all in her. OP doesn't think they should pay it back so they both suck in the end.", "So she cashiers on his time off. And all of her money goes to her friend until she's repaid.\n\nNowhere does he say that he works 90 hours a week. When he gets home, that's when her shift can start. She'll miss out on some fun weekends and evening time with her kids, but she can keep her friendship \u2014 that is, if it's important to her. \n\ufffc\nI mean, in my city even cashiers make $15 an hour. She can earn some money.", "I\u2019m willing to bet she has cashier skills and no motivation then uses the old \u201cI won\u2019t make enough to cover daycare\u201d like dad works 24/7 and couldn\u2019t take care of his kids when she works nights and weekends! LMAO! I only had cashier skills that I spun into cashier and customer service experience that got me a retail management job! Turns out managers at CVS are just glorified cashiers and the job was easy AF included health insurance!", "There's still part time, or weekend jobs.", "Then she takes two jobs, like everyone else", "Every job starts with training.  What she knows is one thing, what she's willing to learn is another.", "There must be an evening shift somewhere for a low skill employee.", "He doesn\u2019t work 24hours a day. She can get a night job and they can alternate. Or get two jobs to cover the cost of daycare plus extra money. Or have parents/other relatives look after the kids while she works.\n\nIf you\u2019re financial situation is that desperate you make it work, plenty of people do the above because they have to. She\u2019s just making excuses.", "So she works evenings as a cashier and he parents his kids.", "If the husband works the typical 9-5 she could always get a night shift job so that he can watch the kids. Or she can work on the weekends if he has weekends off. That way there\u2019s always someone to watch the kids.", "It's crazy how people here are picturing her getting, like, a 9 to 5 that conflicts with his 9 to 5.\n\nShe has the skill set of a teenager, but luckily there are teenager-level jobs she can get. With teenager friendly hours \u2014 evenings and weekends.\n\n\nNo child care costs involved.", "Night shifts exist though, so if she has cashier experience she can take a few night shifts to make some money", "yeah they might as well have told OP to stop buying avocado toast", "He was making $120,000 a year and had no money in the bank. It's a very typical story.", "He\u2019s being controlling now. Saying sure go. Then not being willing to pay back the money and trashing her friendships is pretty awful. She can\u2019t go get a loan because she doesn\u2019t have an income. He\u2019s totally abusing his power.", "NTA. Honestly since the friend needs paid back yesterday I would insist that your wife find things (clothes, purses, jewelry anything of value) and make her sell her stuff to get the money. This is your wife's mess so she needs to clean it up. It's really shitty that she did this to you AND to her friend. And she is the one that ruined the friendship not you, she wasn't honest on either front.", "So focus on paying it back. If you have enough room on credit cards you might be able to pull it out as cash. Or see if there is $1400 worth of stuff the friend wants. And you can buy it for her. \n\nAlternately there are all kinds of loan places. Find one with the best interest rate. Don\u2019t do a payday loan whatever you do.", "He doesn't think they shouldn't pay it back, he is just aware they don't have the money to pay back.", "I started as a cashier at 18 and was management by 21. It\u2019s really not hard to turn cashiering into more. I hate retail but if I ever have to go back, I got a shit ton of experience.", "Way to go, Icy\\_Command!", "This - get more than one job- she owes her friend that money and she\u2019d better figure out a way to pay it back.", "This requires his wife to be checked into the reality of their situation. However at the moment she is blaming OP for being the one to ruin her friendship due to him being laid off.", "Depending on where they live, she can work at a grocery store, or Walmart from like 6-11 M-F and a full 8 hours one Sat or Sunday. When I worked retail, we relied on those part time closers and they usually worked full 8 hour shifts on the weekend. Depending on the pay, she could pay her friend back in a couple months. With the holidays coming, I know spots are hiring.", "You still don\u2019t know what kind of car they drive, whether or not it\u2019s paid off, etc. I said that your advice was based on assumptions and unhelpful, not that he and his wife managed their money well.", "It's not his debt; his wife needs to figure it out.", "He's said a few times that he probably won't ever pay the friend back after how she treated his wife.", "Doesn't help that OP seems to defend her in the comments. Like, so what if the friend has money? Wife is the one that fucked it up", "They are married, he\u2019s the sole income provider and he told her to go. It\u2019s their debt."]}
