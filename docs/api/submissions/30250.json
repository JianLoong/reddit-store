They are pretty close and she was a bridesmaid for our wedding. Recently another friend invited them to go to Italy to their family\u2019s vineyard as their family was going to Spain for the month. So accommodations are free but the flight, food etc were extra. They left for 2 weeks. \n\nI was not aware of this trip until a month before it was suppose to happen(they booked it 2 months out). Recently I lost my job and had to get another one. It pays around half what my job originally did (120k>66k). My wife only has cashier experience and barely makes more money than it would be worth it for her to work as we have 2 kids (4 and 1). My wife isn\u2019t the best with money, she does spend without thinking and she agreed to this trip without telling me. She had to beg her mom to look after the kids after she said yes to the trip and her friends booked the tickets. Her mom is from another city and came to live with me for 2 weeks as I had to work and couldn\u2019t take care of them when I\u2019m working.\n\nI was extremely mad at her but allowed her to go as I know she\u2019s been depressed since the baby and it was too late anyway. She asked her friend to cover her for the flight and she would pay her back. I knew it was hard for us to pay her friend back but it was a non refundable anyway.\n\nShe came back from the trip very happy until her friend asked for the flights. She had spent $1400 on the trip not including the flight and her friend wanted the $1200 that was the cost of the flight that she had put onto her credit card. We had $300 left in our account and already have credit card debt. We are thinking of downsizing our house to an apartment but it\u2019s hard because as soon as landlords hear that we have kids they don\u2019t want to talk anymore. It really sucks but I told her we can\u2019t pay her friend back until I get a better job.\n\nIt\u2019s been 3 months since the trip and her friend is getting angry because she promised to pay it back and we no longer have money. It\u2019s not like her friend needs the money back, she makes six figures and has a house already, she\u2019s not struggling. I told my wife we don\u2019t have enough to pay her back and she will have to explain to her friend. They clearly did not have a good conversation as her friend blocked her and told their other friends about her refusing to pay her back. She cried and is mad at me for losing my job (I was laid off I had no choice) and ruining her friendship by not pulling money out of my ass to pay her friend. I got mad at her and told her to get a job at night then because I\u2019m trying my best.", "created_utc": 1699049920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17n6ozb/aita_for_ruining_my_wifes_friendship/", "score": 1372, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If not, your wife should give her friend the money from another job, like you said. That would be a good financial lesson.\n\nRegardless, it's clear that this friend is never going to trust her again, and I don't blame them...", "I was very set to go YTA when I first started reading this. Saying things like you 'allowed her to go' and acting it would automatically be her salary that would be equated to childcare costs and be expected to cover those costs. It sounds like you're in a really serious financial position though and I cannot understand her going on an expensive trip when you are in this situation. However overall NTA. I appreciate she has depression but you guys can't magic money out of thin air and if you could it should be spent on providing for your kids not luxury holidays. Your wife absolutely should have asked the cost of the flight before agreeing to go.", "NTA\n\nHer not paying her friend back isn't your fault.\n\nIt's her fault for agreeing to something she couldn't afford.\n\nYour wife ruined her own friendship, not you.\n\nThat she's mad at you for getting laid off is really telling about the type of person she is, what she thinks of you, and what she considers your role in this relationship to be. You aren't there to be loved by her, you're there to financially support her.", "NTA, but your wife is. Is there no option for her to make money doing a side gig to get this paid for? Like if she did rover for a couple months, or even set up a payment plan with her friend and paid her back in small increments? She should\u2019ve been straight up with her friend from the beginning that money is tight. Friends should never lend money unless they\u2019re willing to accept that they may not get it back.", "NTA - let\u2019s get this straight: YOU didn\u2019t agree to an international trip without discussing it with your spouse. YOU didn\u2019t spring it on your spouse only a month before you let them with their mother-in-law and two children to juggle, while also working a new job and struggling with newer finances. YOU didn\u2019t beg a friend to cover a significant amount of $ for you and promise to pay it back, while knowing your family really didn\u2019t have the money for any of it.\n\nSo\u2026 YOU didn\u2019t ruin the friendship, SHE did.", "NTA, your wife's poor decision making skills and lack of money management is what caused the falling out between her and her friends. You played no role in the whole ordeal.", "ESH, good lord.\n\nYour wife has been an AH to everyone in this situation - to you, to her mother, to her friend. Let's be clear here: YOU didn't ruin her friendship. She did that by promising to pay her friend back when she knew damn well yall didn't have the money for that. It sounds like she has a pattern of impulse spending and poor financial self-control. She needs to deal with that. Do you guys talk about financials regularly? Does she know how much is coming in and how much is going out, and for what? I'd strongly suggest getting a budgeting app you can both use together - YNAB is my app of choice, it's worked well for me for years - so there's full transparency, and literally having a scheduled budget meeting on a weekly basis to go over it.\n\nHowever, you're making a lot of assumptions about what her friend does or doesn't need, and you're apparently just fine with not even trying to pay her back because \"she's not struggling\", which is a huge AH move. I make six figures and own a home, but $1400 still isn't pocket change to me and I'd be pretty pissed if I loaned someone that much and then they were just like oops can't repay you guess you're shit out of luck! What her friend does or doesn't need, or whether she's \"struggling\" or not, is not up to you to decide with an outsider's eyes. There may be shit going on you don't know about. You know what it's called when a person takes another person's money and then refuses to give it back? THEFT. Which you are apparently fine with condoning if the person doesn't \"need it\" according to your personal judgment of their life.\n\nAnd frankly, I'm not sure I'd quite call the friend an AH, but she was an idiot to loan that kind of money to a friend. Never loan a friend or family member money you can't live with not getting back.\n\nYou and your wife both need to sit down, possibly with a financial counselor (check with your bank or credit union as some offer that as a service, or check with your HR to see if your employer offers an EAP, as that often includes financial coaching as well), and recalibrate your entire way of thinking about finances, or else you're not getting out of this hole anytime soon.", "NTA, she ruined the relationship herself. She knew perfectly well that she couldn't afford the trip, borrowed money, and promised to pay it back. She should have discussed the situation with her friend before asking for the money and agreed on a repayment plan before the trip.\n\nThis was her decision; it's not your responsibility to fix her mistakes. Your suggestion that she should find a job to pay off the debt is valid, and it would be beneficial to have a second income while improving your financial situation.", "NTA. However Y T A for refusing to pay the $1200 back based on your comments, simply bc your wife\u2019s friend \u201cdoesn\u2019t need it,\u201d and how \u201cbadly she treated your wife.\u201d\n\nShe treated her as she should!! She paid for the flight under the circumstances that your wife would pay her back - and your wife knew neither of you could. That\u2019s SO shitty. You having kids and her being better off financially doesn\u2019t change that. \n\nYour wife dug the two of you into this hole, she needs to dig you out and learn to be more responsible with money", "You and your wife are both assholes. She is clearly financially irresponsible and she shouldn\u2019t have gone on that trip while she can\u2019t afford it. She promised to pay the friend back and $1200 is a lot of money unless you are a billionaire. But even then if you promised to do something it\u2019s an asshole move to not follow through. \n\nOp, you are an asshole because even though you think someone lives comfortably you don\u2019t get to decide they don\u2019t need the money. I\u2019m pretty sure the friend worked hard so they can do a huge favor for your wife and pay for her ticket. \nHow about we flip this around and say the friend doesn\u2019t care about you having kids and your wife\u2019s cashier job?", "In my opinion you are NTA.\n1. your wife should have talked with you before she booked the trip.\n2. your wife should not have spent that much money if she/you can't afford it.\n3. it is not your fault that their friendship is ruined. Your wife should not have made a promise, she could not keep.", "ESH both of you are in your 30s, have kids, and are just financially-bumbling thieves? \n\nYour wife stole her friend's money and you're encouraging her to do that. She deserves to have her friendships nuked, but honestly it sounds like she needs a therapist and a financial advisor because she's making almost-intentionally poor decisions. You recognize she's depressed and instead of getting her mental health care, you agree she should go on a trip you can't afford, knowing you'll struggle to pay back the friend?\n\nY'all both needs second jobs since you can't keep your expenses in line with your current incomes.", "NTA - Classic case of \"don't cash a check your tush can't bounce\".\n\nIf she wasn't paying attention to the finances, that's on her. She's coming off as extremely entitled and bratty.", "Nta. You didn't choose to lose your job, and it was really disrespectful for your wife to plan to go on the trip without even discussing it with you. As far as the friend goes, it's understandable she wants to be paid back if that was the agreement. However, if you don't have it then you don't have it. In my opinion your wife was really selfish to pick such a lavish trip over the financial well-being of her family.", "YTA for admitting in the comments that you refusing to ever pay the friend back because you're pissed she outed your wife as a liar to their friends. You realize she can probably take you to smalls claims court over this right? Obviously your wife is the biggest asshole here, but you are too for how you're handling this", "You guys need to give her small amounts of the money if she wants to salvage her relationship. 50-100 bucks at least monthly.", "If your wife works and even barely makes more than it would cost to cover child care,  that's still something more.  She needs to take responsibility for creating this situation.  Even if she only sends her ex friend a small amount monthly,  it's still something.  She may only have a small amount of experience,  but she won't gain any more by not working.  If you got a fabulous new job next month that covered everything,  it's still no guarantee that things will always be peachy.  She needs to have some experience and options in case of financial emergency.", "NTA. You're not the asshole for losing your job, as it was beyond your control. It's understandable that you're facing financial difficulties, and your wife should have communicated with you about the trip and its expenses beforehand. Her friend's reaction seems unfair, given her financial situation, but your wife should have been upfront with her. It's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your wife about the financial challenges and find a solution together that works for both of you.", "She shouldn't have gone on the trip, the fact is that neither of you could afford it. She should have discussed this with you before any tickets were bought. It's time for you and her to have a serious conversation about this, and don't let her put blame on you. She fucked up her friendships for a stupid vacation. Your wife needs to get a job and start payment plans, though I don't think her friendships will ever be the same again. NTA", "ESH She knew that the money was not there and spent 3K on the trip anyway. You were laid off and the kids were sent off to grandma's. She should not have gone on that trip at that time.\n\nYTA for counting her friend's money. It was a loan and not a gift, so you should not be complaining that the friend is rich, etc. Your wife is a grown woman and made the choice to splurge on this trip.  It sounds as though your wife is trying to keep up with the Joneses but you are broke. Friend deserves her money back. Wife needs to work out some sort of arrangement with the friend, even if it's $20 a week, in good faith.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't ruin your wife's friendship. She did that all on her own by taking money from her friend knowing that she wasn't going to be able to pay her back. You are not in the wrong here. Not only did she plan a trip and didn't even ask you about it, she hid it from you for a month. It's her fault. The responsible decision would have been to not go on the trip at all.", "YTA for this: \" It\u2019s not like her friend needs the money back, she makes six figures and has a house already, she\u2019s not struggling.\"  So promises are nothing? Your wife went on an expensive trip she knew she couldn't afford and you both decided it's ok to just not even attempt to pay back the friend because she has money?  \n\nHow hard is it to explain the situation and set up a payment plan - even $10-$25 a week would show you're both making a good-faith effort!", "NTA. YOU didn't ruin her friendship - she did. And seriously damaged her relationship with you. Even if she did have her own money, you talk about trips like this before deciding to go.", "ESH - except the friend.  She should have never gone on the trip.   You should pay the friend back.  It doesn't matter whether the friend needs the money or not, 1200 is a shit ton of money and stealing is wrong (that's what it is when you borrow money and don't pay it back, it's called stealing).  You need to have a discussion with the friend and make a payment plan that is doable, not say \"oh too bad, so sad, you're rich it doesn't matter\".", "NTA she needs to figure out the money to pay. She wanted this trip and now she has to pay it back. She knew before agreeing that you were making less. She blaming you for her own poor decision and it's consequences.", "NTA for the trip, but c'mon on the whole \"they make enough to pay for it\" garbage. It was over a k, and it was a loan. Of course the person is going to be pissed and have every right to be.", "YTA based on your response to comments. You can\u2019t never pay the friend back just because she\u2019s better off then you and rightfully called your wife out.", "ESH. I get you're stressed but you do need to pay back that friend of hers. And Y'all need a come to Jesus talk about finances and lock down spending.\n\nAnd YOU need to reach out to the friend regarding payment. They've MORE than likely heard a different story than what you've said here. Clear the air. \n\nIf you are blocked on social media? Find a friend of the friend and hand over a letter.\n\nExplain that you were unaware of the travel plans (they may've thought you were on board with it). That you were trying to make the best of it. \n\nWife needs to acknowledge the debt. To acknowledge she fricked up. And to apologize for such recklessness. Both to you, and to her friend(s). And you both do need to find a way to pay friend back. Maybe not immediately, but $1200 is a lot of money. Even just sitting down to discuss a payment plan would help. You don't want that hanging over you forever (especially if she has proof it was intended to be paid back).\n\nYOU did not ruin the friendship, SHE did with her decisions. But since you are married, the debt is shared here (since it sounds like you have shared finances), since it sounds like repayment was agreed upon with both of you and now you're wanting to back out.\n\nThe friends have played this game before. This was just the last straw for them, I can practically guarantee. I've paid for friends before under the guise that they couldn't afford it, only to realize they had money (e.g. here, the $1400 spent overseas), and didn't have any intentions to pay me back in any reasonable timeframe (if at all) because I had \"more\" and could \"afford it\". Never again.\n\nSeriously, though. I get you're stressed. You are allowed to be stressed and frustrated and angry. Feel those (valid!) emotions. \n\nBest of luck.", "NTA\nYour wife ruined her own friendship. She's an adult and should budget better. Not your fault she didn't plan well and spent so much money. She should be paying for all of it, time for a job!", "NTA. Your financial position right now is not your fault, and there is only so far your money can go. Your wife shouldn't have borrowed money she could not afford to pay back. Imagine going on a trip like this, knowing your financial position and having two little people mouths to feed as well. This will hopefully be a learning lesson for your wife.", "If anything I believe this post belongs in r/relationshipadvice. Clearly anybody sane reading this would say NTA, your wife signed up for this and made her own promises and put all her bets on you.", "Your  wife\u2019s friend is NTA, and it is your wife who is ruining this friendship.

She put her own selfish wants before your family\u2019s well being. This is extremely irresponsible behavior especially since you have young children.

They are pretty close and she was a bridesmaid for our wedding. Recently another friend invited them to go to Italy to their family\u2019s vineyard as their family was going to Spain for the month. So accommodations are free but the flight, food etc were extra. They left for 2 weeks. \n\nI was not aware of this trip until a month before it was suppose to happen(they booked it 2 months out). Recently I lost my job and had to get another one. It pays around half what my job originally did (120k>66k). My wife only has cashier experience and barely makes more money than it would be worth it for her to work as we have 2 kids (4 and 1). My wife isn\u2019t the best with money, she does spend without thinking and she agreed to this trip without telling me. She had to beg her mom to look after the kids after she said yes to the trip and her friends booked the tickets. Her mom is from another city and came to live with me for 2 weeks as I had to work and couldn\u2019t take care of them when I\u2019m working.\n\nI was extremely mad at her but allowed her to go as I know she\u2019s been depressed since the baby and it was too late anyway. She asked her friend to cover her for the flight and she would pay her back. I knew it was hard for us to pay her friend back but it was a non refundable anyway.\n\nShe came back from the trip very happy until her friend asked for the flights. She had spent $1400 on the trip not including the flight and her friend wanted the $1200 that was the cost of the flight that she had put onto her credit card. We had $300 left in our account and already have credit card debt. We are thinking of downsizing our house to an apartment but it\u2019s hard because as soon as landlords hear that we have kids they don\u2019t want to talk anymore. It really sucks but I told her we can\u2019t pay her friend back until I get a better job.\n\nIt\u2019s been 3 months since the trip and her friend is getting angry because she promised to pay it back and we no longer have money. It\u2019s not like her friend needs the money back, she makes six figures and has a house already, she\u2019s not struggling. I told my wife we don\u2019t have enough to pay her back and she will have to explain to her friend. They clearly did not have a good conversation as her friend blocked her and told their other friends about her refusing to pay her back. She cried and is mad at me for losing my job (I was laid off I had no choice) and I got mad at her and told her to get a job then because I\u2019m trying my best.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

First she asked the friend to secretly book the trip on her credit card and she would pay her back. That was to hide the trip from you. Then your wife lied about how much money she was going to spend on the trip THEN she lied about paying back her friend.\n\nBut then you blame the friend \n\n1.

And she HID it from you so you couldn\u2019t say no.", "If she cries to her mother and friends for money THEY should give her money.\n\nOP you have a really serious wife problem.", "To sum up: your wife is a liar who refuses to take responsibility for her actions and you enable her. Why hasn't she learned any skills that translate into earning an income? Is she incompetent or does she just see you as a meal ticket?", "Even if you have no spine to stand up for yourself, think of your kids! She is literally jeopardising their needs and future for her selfish whims and you are letting her. They are helpless and you are their father. If you do not advocate for them, no one will.", "Honestly, reading this YTA. I was leaning towards ESH because your wife shouldn\u2019t be going on extravagant trips when y\u2019all are financially struggling and have children to feed, but YTA for marrying a woman who you have to treat like a child. I can\u2019t believe this is a grown woman we\u2019re reading about. Your poor children. You should have been kinder to yourself and to them, and married a person who didn\u2019t need to be given an allowance because they don\u2019t understand basic finance.", "If OPs wife is comfortable lying to her husband, she\u2019d also be comfy lying to her friends. \n\nHer friends aren\u2019t responsible for her actions, and OPs wife made several promises. Like sticking to cash only, only using $500, and staying in and cooking meals. But she didn\u2019t.", "Exactly this. Had OP set a hard line, this sub would be calling him an abuser, manipulator, etc. OP was fucked if he did and damned if he didn't.", "In the comments, OP has zero intention of paying the friend back at all. They were never planning to.", "In a month you can call the airline and have the charges moved to your own card.  Wife intentionally fucked over her friend and OP was completely fine letting her do it, but I'd wager if the situation was reversed would scream bloody murder", "My friend is a closer at Burger King, works 3-4 nights a week + weekends.   Husband comes home they have a quick dinner, she goes to work & he baths & puts the kids to bed. Neither have a lot of time for friends but they make family time.", "I had $8k saved the rest of my money I was paying towards my 64k student loans. I have 12k left but I was paying that off since before the pandemic. My wife also came into the marriage with 8k in a car loan and 12k in student loans (she only did one semester) and about 10k in credit cards. I\u2019ve paid most of that off and then this happened. I also only made 120k for 2 years. Before that I made 60-70k.", "No she\u2019s the one taking advantage and it\u2019s ridiculous that you would say *he\u2019s* trashing her friendship - he made the money available and she spent it on eating out instead of paying back her friend.", "The money was already gone before OP knew about the trip, so I think the wife would have been the AH either way for putting her family into a deeper financial hole. But the situation was made worse when she spent beyond her means on another persons card while on the trip.", "Op does not have to pay that, the one who acquired the debt and decided to go for a walk alone and secretly is the wife, op does not have the money to pay, and it is fair that the one who pays the debt is the wife.", "I didn\u2019t read OPs comments. I stand corrected, OP is an AH. Thank you", "She also refuses to talk about finances.", "Yikes! Your wife knew all this AND that you both have 2 kids to support and still thought, \"I'm just going to take off on an expensive trip for two weeks. My husband can work out how to pay.\" \n\nAnd you're blaming the friend instead of your selfish, inconsiderate wife?!", "i haven't even had half as much credit card debt as that and it feels like a huge burden on my relationship, as my gf has said she's alright with me trying to pay that off before contributing more to our household expenses. but i don't work very much and my adhd gives me terrible impulse control and i want Stuff for gratification, so i'm not doing perfectly by any means at just paying it off.\n\nthat hangs over my head every day and causes me so much anxiety. my anxiety is at the point that it causes me physical pain due to my tmj. \n\nif my gf was making enough to get rid of my cc debt, i would probably throw up out of guilt and relief simultaneously lol and break down in tears. \n\ni can't even IMAGINE how entitled your wife is. she has no concept, it seems, of what an incredibly generous gift you gave her by paying that stuff off. i'm so sorry that you're being taken advantage of so horribly. \n\nthe fact that she doesn't seem to feel bad at all and just expected you to magically have a higher paying job again right away is just... so selfish. i would really ask myself, if i were you op, if my wife loved me as a person or if she just loved my paycheck. i'm sorry.", "She spent $1400 on our card not her friends. I wanted to just give her cash since she can\u2019t control herself. She promised she would, that didn\u2019t last", "The OP defended his wife up and down in the comments, and called the dept a shared dept. He still doesn\u2019t feel the friend should be paid back because she \u201churt his wife\u2019s feelings by spreading rumours\u201d", "It's an easy excuse.  OP already revealed themselves at the end as one of those types who figure because someone makes better money or choices about money they are entitled to a cut of it.  Don't get me wrong, it would suck eggs if I lost my job and our income was cut in half, but OP hasn't been on that train long.  For them to already be down to $300 so soon tells me this isn't the first time they've actively decided to live well beyond their means", "He told her to go - he didn\u2019t tell her to spend an additional $1400", "He told her to go because the ticket was already paid for. The fact that they are married is irrelevant. They didn't make a joint decision and, therefore, he's not responsible. The wife can get a job and pay her friend back."]}
