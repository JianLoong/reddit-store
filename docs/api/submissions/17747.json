Their wedding party is at least 8 people on my brothers side alone so it\u2019s not as if they want to keep the wedding party small or something. I had an uneven number of bridesmaids and groomsmen because I insisted my brother stand up in my wedding, so I would also be kinda hurt if that was the reason because it seems like not a big deal. \n\nMy feelings have been really hurt by this, and I know that it\u2019s their day and obviously it\u2019s completely up to them to decide who they want standing by them.

Typically the bride chooses her bridesmaids ate you close to his fiancee?", " I would suggest that your brother left it up to his partner to choose her own bridal party and for some reason she has chosen not to include you.
