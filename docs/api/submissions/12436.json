{"id": 12436, "submission_id": "11ss5fb", "title": "AITA for asking my friend who just had a baby to help me move house?", "selftext": "So me (26f) and my friend John (26m) have been close mates for years. I recently had to move out of my apartment because I couldn\u2019t afford the rent.\n\nI don\u2019t have a whole lot of stuff so I didn\u2019t bother wasting time and money hiring removalists, I just hired a van to move all my stuff. Most of the stuff I could easily move myself, but the biggest item that I needed help with was my mattress. \n\nMost of my friends are small girls and definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to help move the bed, and my only guy friend John is a big gym bro.\n\nJohn recently had a baby about 2-3month prior. So I called him and asked if it was possible for him to come help me move the mattress, I could take care of everything else. I told him if he couldn\u2019t, I would ask my uncle (51m) to help, but he\u2019s a bit old and lives about 2hrs away and also has kids to take care of so I wanted to ask John first.\n\nHe said it was okay, I asked him if he was sure in case he has to take care of his newborn and to check with his wife and he said it was all good. \n\nI asked him about 3 weeks in advance and checked in closer to the date if we were still good, he assured me it was fine.\n\nSo the plan was that I\u2019ll get the van, move all the small stuff first, then call John to help me with loading the mattress and take it to the new apartment, help me take it into the new apartment and he could leave and I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\n\nSo the day of the move comes, I go to collect the van and I get a text from John saying he\u2019s not coming anymore because he needs to take care of his baby. I ask if his wife could take care of the baby just for a little because I\u2019ve already gotten everything ready. He said his wife doesn\u2019t want him to go but didn\u2019t say why. He then changed and said his wife and baby are suddenly both sick so he needs to stay home. I didn\u2019t argue and said okay, I didn\u2019t want to push someone who is probably stressed from the new responsibilities of being a new father, although I did get a little upset/annoyed at this.\n\nI\u2019m just stressed about how I\u2019m going to move the mattress since I\u2019ve already hired the van. And if I\u2019m not able to, where am I going to sleep for the night?\n\nSince then, John and I haven\u2019t spoken and it\u2019s been 9 months. My friend said I should reach out because I should be more understanding of his situation and that I was an asshole for asking him to begin with. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678968220, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ss5fb/aita_for_asking_my_friend_who_just_had_a_baby_to/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s understandable if an unforeseen circumstance happened and mother and baby truly weren\u2019t well for him to cancel and its only natural to feel annoyed by it but you seemed like you were understanding.\n\nFeel like there is more to why John cancelLed the way he did I\u2019m not too sure about how good your relationship is with his wife could possibly have something to do with the situation?", "NTA for asking him at all. He could of said no if he wanted to. He could of said maybe. He said yes. \n\nPeople can change their mind and things come up unexpectedly, but he let you down. \n\nYou had to contact him on the day of the move, only to find out he\u2019s not coming. He should of contacted you. \n\nGut feeling is the wife found out and got jealous. \n\nEither way, he\u2019s let you down. He should apologise to you. The fact that he hadn\u2019t contacted you in 9mths , says all you need to know", "NTA You clearly gave him the option to say no. He is the AH for abandoning you and lying to you. And he is obviously not your friend anymore.", "INFO: how did you move the matress? I am curious rn", "I N F O:\n\nWait, you stopped talking to John for 9 months because he didn\u2019t show up or did life push you two apart?\n\nNTA.\n\nNothing wrong with being upset when plans change but don\u2019t take it personally. You\u2019re NTA.\n\nEDIT: I misread this. He did change up his story. I\u2019m not going to lie, he is a bit of an AH. He simply wanted to get out of helping you and used his family as an excuse to do it; and now that I think about it, it can\u2019t be a coincidence that all of this happened on the day he was supposedly going to help\n\nI thorougly re-read the story and yeah, his wife simply don\u2019t want him to help you. I think his wife is straight up jealous", "NAH.  When you have family/kids, things do come up last minute.  I think this is less about a \"newborn\" than just not being able to help out exactly when you needed it.  You should have had backup plans honestly instead of relying on one person.   \n\nThough I'm surprised if a few girls couldn't move a mattress even if it was a king.  (I'm sure the debate will now begin on this, but honestly, I've seen girls handling things like this often, including a heavy sleeper sofa sectional and king memory foam bed).", "NTA. Your title has nothing to do with my answer.  Your friend made a commitment and didn't keep it and that negatively affected you.  You needed help and he could have said no from the getgo but instead he waited until the last minute and put you in a difficult position. That makes your friend a big ah.\n\n\ud83d\udc4fyou make a commitment \ud83d\udc4f you keep that commitment \ud83d\udc4f\n\nEdit: if his family was actually sick and needed him, that's different but the way it sounded to me was more lies and excuses than them actually being sick.  Even still, you'd think he could at least get the mattress out of the house and go home, maybe pick up saltines on the way home.  In the least he could have given you more of a heads up so you could ask your uncle or someone else.", "Slight YTA for assuming your small girlfriends can't help move a mattress.", "NTA- He obviously changed stories mid conversation and it doesn't matter in the end. You asked and there's nothing wrong in asking baby or no baby.", "Nta and tbh I would be annoyed it\u2019s not like you asked him the day of. Things happen but just keep that in mind when someone asks you for favours. Don\u2019t give so much when others only take. Something similar happened to me and then they had the nerve to ask me for a favour after a few weeks I said na.", "NTA.  This sounds more like someone who just didn\u2019t want to help you move and came up with an excuse.  Either he was overwhelmed, she was overwhelmed, or he just changed his mind.  If it\u2019s a friendship you want to maintain, reach out.  I wouldn\u2019t apologize.  Just see how he\u2019s doing and go from there.", "NTA\n\nIt was the excuse midway that made you n-ta.\n\nAlso, people who have kids should not make commitments if they're not going to follow through.", "NAH. You asked him, you didn't force him. Nothing bad with that.\n\nBut he had a family emergency, which sucks, but happens.", "NAH based on the info we have.\n\nThere was absolutely nothing wrong with you asking - it's a couple hours at worst and it's not like he absolutely needs to be at his wife/child's side constantly (I assume he goes to work, out shopping, etc.).  But at the same time, he's not obliged to drop other things for your benefit, and while the claim of the family being sick sounds a little iffy, it could be true and I'll give him the benefit of the doubt (just as you did when you stopped asking).\n\nIt's strange that things have been quiet between you since then - is that normal? Did you try to initiate any conversation in that time?", "NAH. You weren\u2019t rude or demanded he come. Newborns can demand a lot of attention so it\u2019s plausible that something came up where he genuinely couldn\u2019t go. Not really something to start a huge fight over now that it\u2019s been 9 months, sure an inconvenience but not something to argue over.", "NTA\nI am a woman who can move a mattress pretty easily on my own though, a few girls could definitely do that.", "NAH. Newborn babies are a ton of work. If you've never had one, it's really easy to think that they aren't. Your friend has his priorities in order. He may have sincerely wanted to help you, but in the end... A newborn can, and more than likely will ruin every plan you're gonna make. Just be happy you aren't in his shoes and move on.", "NTA. can we be clear \u2026 John didn\u2019t have the baby; his wife did. She\u2019s recovering, she\u2019s nursing. My guess - and only a guess - is that John has not been the most attentive father and husband and the wife is busting his chops by preventing him from helping you , as in \u201coh, you are going to help your girl-friend (note, this is not same as girlfriend) but here, you come home late from work and don\u2019t bother with me or child and go straight to video games\u201d. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in their marriage really, but there are things not right. Well, you may have lost money but have a good idea about John.", "YTA if you haven't been speaking to him for months because of that.\n\nWhen you ask friends to help you for free, you have to deal with the fact that something can come up. Especially since having a newborn at home the risk of stuff like illness coming up was much higher. At that age, even the common cold can end up requiring a trip to the ER.", "NTA - the baby is 2-3 months old.  Assuming you're in the US, John's wife is probably back at work if she was on maternity leave.  So having a baby isn't the issue.\n\nI wonder if John's wife is uncomfortable with your friendship with John?  But at any rate, you were exceptionally considerate with the way you went about this.  Your friend is wrong, there is no reason you couldn't ask for help, he had every opportunity to say no.  I do suggest reaching out to him though, you two were friends.", "YTA. Not for asking, but for getting mad when parenthood interfered even though you both acknowledged up front it was a possibility.", "Women can carry a matress by the way. I think you were a little dramatic there", "It's been 9 months since this happened and you're still worried about how to move the mattress?....is anything on this sub a true story?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It has nothing to do with the baby.", "no assholes here. kids are wild. so are some post birth women. lets just assume he judged the situation right. you used him for hes muscle, he got nothing. (you could have at least bribed him with a free babysit so they could go on a date or something simple).", "Good point! Now that you mention it. John and I have been close friends for years as we went to uni together. He was a bit of a \u2018fuckboy\u2019 back then but to me we\u2019ve always had more of a sibling dynamic. \n\nNaturally there were always rumours about us being involved but totally untrue, he was dating his wife then and I had a boyfriend. But on his wedding he wanted to ask me to be his best man because he didn\u2019t have anyone else as close to him but we unanimously decided against it because it was not a good look. \n\nHis wife and I have got on alright, no animosity or anything at all. But unsure if the above might have affected her in their personal life that I might not have been aware of.", "Probably a mixture of both, but I won\u2019t lie, I didn\u2019t reach out to him because I was a little upset at being left in a situation like that. \n\nHe probably hasn\u2019t reached out either because of his new family and life in general.", "I agree. My kids move mattresses around to build forts and stuff, so I am a bit confused about why these girls can't do this.", "When we work together, we can move heavy things. A small group of small women can move a mattress.", "I am small and cannot move the mattress, and they are a lot smaller than me", "No he didn\u2019t lol\nHe has a jealous wife who just found out what he had committed to doing", "Well I told him I\u2019d buy him dinner as a thank you for helping me (which didn\u2019t end up happening because he didn\u2019t show up)", "Uh, just because the US has limited family leave, that doesn't mean the baby isn't the issue. If Mom has gone back to work, she may be even more exhausted than if she were still on leave. Even more so if she is breastfeeding. John's wife could have been having a really rough day and wanted him to stay and help her instead of leaving her alone with the baby.", "...you mean his wife interfered.", "It could be very possible maybe if she\u2019s feeling insecure after having the baby (which is totally understandable your body changes and goes through a lot and can impact you mentally too)  and if she\u2019s has told him she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with him doing this he could of came up with an excuse that keeps everyone happy and you\u2019d have enough time to ask your uncle if he could help you.", "So you took that a bit personally? That he didn\u2019t show up because of a family emergency?", "Agree, I'm a short and disabled female and I could move a mattress. He could have at least asked the girls then it's up to them to say yes or no rather than assuming.", "I'm small but me and my small daughters can move a mattress together. Lots of smalls together can move an item. It's not easy and you'll probably spend more time laughing, but it can be done.", "You might check Task Rabbit.

Lying about being sick because his first excuse was too weak.", "There\u2019s no way of knowing for sure but due to way he kept changing his story, gut feeling this is what happened", "If someone rents a van and you let them down, you reach out and apologise even if not entirely within their control. Maybe op should have reached out but the dude is way worse for not doing so. \n\nI can't lift anything myself if I rented a van and had promised help I'd be annoyed by it to.\n\nI've lost a friend as their partner didn't want them around me and if I felt like anyone done that again, I wouldn't reach out to them unless they did me. As it isn't worth fighting for. I wouldn't ever see why they wouldn't reach out another day and say sorry for letting ya down unless there was something like that stopping us being friends suddenly.", "I don't know where you got that from. Your assumptions are gross. Stop projecting your prejudices onto other people.", "His story kept changing? Like did he come up with another story after he said his kid and wife was sick?", "Oh I misread this", "The insistence by people in this discussion that John lied is so odd.  There is nothing to suggest he lied, just that he didn\u2019t provide full information (perhaps to protect his wife\u2019s privacy), and then felt like he needed to explain further when OP wouldn\u2019t accept his answer.", "He didn't change his story. He said at first his wife didn't want him to go. After, he said that his wife and kid were sick.\n\nIt's totally plausible that wife and kid are sick, and the wife asked him not to go because she was too sick. John just didn't disclose the sickness at first.", "You\u2019re criticizing others for making assumptions?  Look in the mirror, my friend.", "And then not talk to a friend for 9 months, after being close enough that they were nearly your best \"man\"? Over a moving day you were at fault and let them down?\n\nNah.\n\nNot much room for deduction left to me. Either wifey doesn't like husband having close female friends or the husband caught feelings and recognised need for distance also. There isn't any other logic i see to ruin a close friendship. If two straight guys had plans to help the other move and one let them down, it would be really straightforward to sort and apologise for the person that let the other down. \n\nThe only reason you'd not apologise for the let down and make it up is if there was external or internal pressure to not make that friendship a priority anymore surely. Otherwise its just crazy to lose someone after failing them a single time and not make amends.", "Or John didn\u2019t tell the wife/just assumed it would be fine until day of and she wasn\u2019t cool with it so he panicked. I\u2019m not gonna presume it\u2019s nefarious on the wife\u2019s part or John copped \u201cthe feels.\u201d Dude probably just dropped the ball communication wise. To not talk for 9 months after is a tad dramatic of him though\u2026 better for him to fess up, apologize, and just let it go", "There was nothing stopping OP to text him a week later to ask about how the baby and mom are doing. Communication works two ways. He probably isn\u2019t even getting a full nights sleep. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s not an AH, but the whole 9 months of not talking aka both of them ghosting each other on both of them", "I just feel from how close they sounded before, you don't ruin friendships like that because you goofed and let them down one day. You ruin friendships for more significant reasons. \n\nI think me messing up my schedule and letting a friend down and being like \"whelp guess that's that friendship over with forever I've made a right pillock of myself\" is very odd and can't be common behaviour without further reasoning."]}
