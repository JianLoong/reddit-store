She had a pregnant dog that she found a home for after the puppies were weaned and the dog was fixed.  I had arranged to get one of the puppies for my girlfriend 23.  We had gone together and picked one out.  \n\nI have not had a dog since I left for school when I was 17 so I was pretty excited to have a furry buddy again.  \n\nWe went shopping and I picked up everything we would need for the puppy.  He was going to be her moving in with me gift.  \n\nWell she had slightly different plans and hooked up with her ex because she was feeling stressed about moving in with me. \n\nSo she won't be moving in with me.  I boxed up her crap she had at my house and she gone. \n\nBut she still wants the puppy.  I don't think so.  I told my friend that the puppy was mine and that under no circumstances was she to give him to my ex.  My friend knows that I paid for everything and that I regularly give her money to help her with her fostering.  So when the puppy is ready to be rehomed he is coming with me.  \n\nNow my ex is calling me and texting me saying that I am stealing her dog since I promised him to her. She even had her dad call me and say that we had a verbal contract that it was her dog.  \n\nWell I told him that the puppy was a \"moving in\" gift. So since she will NEVER be moving in our contract is null and void.  I did not tell him why she isn't moving in.  \n\nHer friends are crapping on me for keeping a gift.  \n\nMy friends are saying she can piss up a rope but not mentioning why she isn't moving in because I asked them not to.  \n\nSo am I the asshole for keeping him?", "created_utc": 1668508837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvthu3/aita_for_stealing_a_dog_i_got_for_my_girlfriend/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not to mention the puppy is still with the foster until it\u2019s a few weeks older so there\u2019s no theft occurring in any other context either. Your ex needs a reality check.", "NTA. It was a conditional gift. Like an engagement ring. You don't get married, you give the ring back. She doesn't move in, she doesn't keep the pup.", "NTA she made her bed and now she has to lie in it without a dog. You bought it and it was for her to move in, which she never did. Tell her to let her ex buy one.", "NTA\n\nPupper stays with you. \n\nThe other dawg can live with her ex and he can get her one.", "You didn\u2019t steal anything! You\u2019re keeping a dog you bought to live in your place. Maybe if she didn\u2019t stress f*ck her ex she wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament. Also someone that impulsive doesn\u2019t deserve the right to own a dog. Question though OP what kind of rescue doggo?", "NTA.  You need to tell people why  she is not moving in.", "NTA.  I wouldn't give her anything, and I wouldn't be hiding what she did either.  If her father calls you again, tell him the whole story.", "NTA, you also had a verbal contract that she not bang another guy. Tell her to take the L or next time daddy calls he gets the full story.", "NTA  \n\nHer ex-ex(?) can get her a puppy.", "Bruh, the entitlement of some people. I literally can't even. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "Nta. As you said, you planned to give the gift upon moving in, but since that didn\u2019t happen, you no longer need to or have to give it. She never had actual ownership of the dog and never bonded with it. You are well within your right to keep it. Tell your ex to get her own, and then cut contact with her or her family, you don\u2019t owe them a thing. I doubt they\u2019d ever even try to take legal action, but they would never win even if they did. Enjoy your new pup!", "NTA\n\nYou paid for the puppy, and you were buying the puppy for both of you, not just her.\n\nSounds like she\u2019s told her friends that you bought the puppy for her.\n\nEither way, she fucked up, and you 2 broke up, you have no obligation to go e her the puppy since ypu haven\u2019t brought it home yet.", "NTA, easy way to get dad off your back, don\u2019t fluff around, tell him straight up why his little princess isn\u2019t moving in with you.", "NTA.\n\nAnd the \"verbal contract\" thing is idiotic, because you don't have a contract for a gift. A contract requires consideration on both sides; a gift is unilateral.", "NTA\n\nI came here ready to call you the ahole but seriously? I needed to keep myself from laughing.", "NTA\n\nIf the puppy is in your name; you are the one who arranged and will be collecting, the adoption contract, microchip, vet bills for puppy boosters, and receipt for payment for adoption etc.\n\nIf this was arranged by both of you with the rescue things could get messy. Or if the pup is in her name - again messy.\n\nI used to be in rescue and unfortunately, this happens quite often and at times did become a legal issue and that what we (at the rescue) would fall back on; who paid and who is on the adoption forms. If this happened some time after adoption you'd be looking at microchip, insurance details and veterinary records.", "NTA\n\nAs someone once said \"*A verbal contract ain't worth the paper it's written on*.\"\n\n(Attributed to Samuel Goldwyn of MGM fame, but no-one seems to be able to prove it)", "NTA\n\nFrom what it sounds like you are attached to the dog and it was originally gonna be a gift but I'm not sure how pets work I know they have to be registered but not sure if you have to register the official owner and if so if you are the official owner then you are NTA on both the morale side and legal side\n\nTBH friends crapping on you for keeping your \"gift\" you might wanna find new friends because that's not right if you bought the dog because you both are attached if it's just out of revenge and not because you care about the dog and are attached to it then you would be the AH", "NTA a gift my definition only becomes a gift after it is given, \u201ca thing given willingly to someone without payment; a present.\u201d Since it was never given it\u2019s not technically a gift. They are literally wrong by definition", "Nta. She cheated and you broke up with her. Why would you then hand over a puppy that you financed completely for her? If she wants one so bad she can go to your fostering friend and buy one herself.", "NTA\n\nYou paid for it and haven't given it yet. It's your puppy, she can eat ass.", "Idea:  tell her if she continues sending in the flying monkeys then you\u2019ll have to let them know why she doesn\u2019t get a \u201cmoving in\u201d present!  I bet it will stop right after that!  Good on you for adopting a puppy and not being a total jerk like her and not outing her!  But do yhreaten her!!  Petty is as petty does!!  NTA", "NTA, your dog.", "NTA. Talk about entitlement !", "NTA. I'm assuming she had also promised you that she'd be monogamous. Cheating voided her agreement with you, and your agreement with her for the puppy... It was very nice of you not to tell her dad the reason. I'd tell her that if she doesn't want him to know, she should drop it. You don't owe her your silence.", "NTA and she's a delusional idiot.\n\nOK, let's blow this up - let's imagine you got her an engagement ring. You picked it out together and you're planning to propose on a certain date. Then she cheats on you and you break up. Would you still give her the engagement ring? Of course not!  That would be idiotic.\n\nSame thing applies to any sort of gift that has not yet been given. Until the gift is made, it's not a gift, even if you already paid for it. \n\nYou promised your girlfriend a dog. Guess what? She's not your girlfriend anymore. She gets nothing.\n\nAnd you can see where she gets her idiocy - her father said you had a verbal contract? He doesn't know what a contract is. She didn't pay you, didn't offer any services in exchange for the dog, she just wanted you to give it to her. \n\nFor the dog's sake and your own, keep doing what you are. I'd hate to see what a crappy dog owner she would be. Enjoy your puppy!", "NTA. The dog never belonged to her, and you paid for it. \n\nAs an aside: living, breathing things are not gifts.
