Cheating voided her agreement with you, and your agreement with her for the puppy... It was very nice of you not to tell her dad the reason. I'd tell her that if she doesn't want him to know, she should drop it. You don't owe her your silence.", "NTA and she's a delusional idiot.\n\nOK, let's blow this up - let's imagine you got her an engagement ring. You picked it out together and you're planning to propose on a certain date. Then she cheats on you and you break up. Would you still give her the engagement ring? Of course not!  That would be idiotic.\n\nSame thing applies to any sort of gift that has not yet been given. Until the gift is made, it's not a gift, even if you already paid for it. \n\nYou promised your girlfriend a dog. Guess what? She's not your girlfriend anymore. She gets nothing.\n\nAnd you can see where she gets her idiocy - her father said you had a verbal contract? He doesn't know what a contract is. She didn't pay you, didn't offer any services in exchange for the dog, she just wanted you to give it to her. \n\nFor the dog's sake and your own, keep doing what you are.

If the gift recipient wants the pet and has made the commitment- why is it an issue to make the pet a gift?", "Animals as gifts are bad when they are done as a surprise and the gift giver is kind of off the hook once the exchange is done, I absolutely agree on that. An animal as a celebration of an event, like moving in with your partner, or a child's birthday, where the animal purchaser is an active participant, owner, responsible for the animal is very different. OP had intended to remain responsible for the animal no matter what happened and, look, she cheated and they broke up and OP is planning on fully continuing to take care of the animal. This concern of yours does not apply to this situation."]}
