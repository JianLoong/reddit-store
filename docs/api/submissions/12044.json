You are a victim of a poorly planned arranged marriage.  The same is true for V, whose family showed no respect for his prior relationship with F.  It is not clear to me how much say V\u2019s parents had in this either if it was arranged by his uncle.  Everyone was faced with a lousy situation, and people handled it poorly.

That's what you need to tell your husband that you don't trust them and that things cannot be fixed with grand gestures like a party.    Each and every one of these people owes you an individual apology that you will accept/reject based on their actual behavior toward you going forward.

I'm making some assumptions that both families are wealthy and there are some business or social ties that resulted in this marriage.\n\nHe had a girlfriend and the family not only seemed to embrace her but he continued to have a relationship with her.  Why in the world did the marriage even happen?  It sounds like they might have been in some sort of situation that necessitated an ally in a \"good\" family so they agreed to the union in convenience but never in spirit.  They not only did not treat you like his wife, they shamed and abused you to the point that you just didn't care any longer.  I'm very surprised you didn't seek to end this farce unless there was an advantage to your family that they fulfilled.\n\nIt sounds like something happened causing them to think the marriage, thus the alliance, would end.  Suddenly, they know they can't risk losing that alliance so they tell F to go away and are trying to make nice with you.  I don't know why F thinks calling you and cussing you out is going to do anything.  You were this man's wife and he essentially was using her as a concubine.  You didn't leave her high and dry and had nothing to do with her relationship with him.  He was married!  You have no responsibility for his mistress.  Why is she mad at you?  For being his wife?\n\nYou told him you had plans and were not going to his party.  Why would you want to spend time with his family given the way they treated you?  Did he say his family had a change of heart?  Did he say beforehand they were going to apologize and try to make amends?  One night of \"we're sorry for being so hateful\" is not going to suddenly make up for years of horrible abuse.\n\nI don't know why your family is suddenly siding with this family.  There must be some pretty involved politics in this relationship for you to 1) agree to marry someone and accept this type of abuse, and 2) not leave him after being treated so shabbily especially after suffering the loss of a child.  Why would you even stay being as miserable as you are?\n\nIf it was me, again not understanding your culture or reasons for staying in this horrible situation, I would have gotten a divorce and gone out to find someone who makes me happy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ask everything, get out of the dark and then decide.", "It took so long for him to admit ops kid was his and she's his wife. Then they blamed her for losing said baby. You think they wouldn't play favorites given the chance?", "The penalties for female adultery will no doubt be far harsher than for men.  The system is designed to keep women subjugated.", "It's entirely likely that she can't given that in places where arranged marriages are quite common, women are often viewed as second class citizens and violence agains them is not uncommon", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t give OP that advice. It may not go the way you think it will.  Never recommend adultery even in a sucky situation like this one.", "Yes, but I wonder what their laws are on illegitimate children inheriting.", "Then she needs to just disappear. She doesn't deserve to be miserable for the rest of her life.", "It's no wonder we haven't advanced much as a species. Too many people still living in the Stone Age.", "I wasn't recommending it, but if someone comes along who treats her the way she deserves to be treated and will love her, then options. \n\nThis is just a messed up situation and it's infuriating that in the 21st century women still have the worth of livestock.", "That's what I was thinking!!!", "Hate to break it to you but this is the reality for the vast majority of women on this planet.  If running away is seen to dishonour the family then her life could very literally be a stake.  Honour killings are an almost daily occurrence in certain places.  Dowry\u2019s are paid in these marriages and should she not fulfil the contract her own family would bear the consequences.  It\u2019s a truly shitty arrangement but it\u2019s deeply entrenched.", "Oh, that's for sure.", "Yes I know it's reality. I don't have to like it or accept it.", "You're right you don't, because it's fucked. But you do have to acknowledge that the cut and run strategy isn't a viable option and we shouldn't encourage desperate people to do things that may result in them being hurt or killed.", "NTA. Run run run and get a divorce. There is probably some monies involved somewhere which is why they are playing nice or an inheritance", "Hugs to u! No u are Not a ahole!!!

I wish you all the best.", "NTA. They've done nothing in 5 years to make you want to trust them.

So now f needs to go away. Most likely f is getting older and demanding a commitment and family. Now they see you as the only hope to have grandchildren that would be accepted by their community. If you can find an out you had better do it before getting pregnant again. They won\u2019t have any use to keep you around after they get a baby for f to raise after you pass or run away.

But run", "There is obviously something fishy going on here, either he/the family need something from you or something has happened re F. He found out she\u2019s not faithful/infertile etc.\n\nNow they decide that you are acceptable and make the smallest amount of effort and expect you to just forget about the abysmal treatment previously. Please find a way to escape this before it gets MUCH worse.", "I am wondering if there is money involved.  It was an arranged marriage.  I wonder if pressure is being put on them for what has been going on and they are running the risk of losing money or something else.", "Put yourself first as your family obviously hasn\u2019t. The fact they forced you to marry a man 11 years older than you that was already in a relationship without any concern for you proves how little they think of you. Do you really want this to be the rest of your life?", "Hey, if you have a way to divorce and leave the country, do it. You're only seen as a meal ticket, not because you're a person with feelings. If you can sell anything of value that you own, do it and use that money to leave the country. Try to talk to your family about how awful they've been, gain support if possible. You won't be seen as a loose woman by your family if they understood. If not, try to get a passport and leave the country. Maybe help your family get the house and land back from these leeches. Don't trust them whatsoever. Research on organizations that can help you get away from this situation. You have internet, use it. Search here on Reddit, people can help. Good luck.

At least not one that doesn't involve challenging thousands of years of culture and tossing aside everything they've ever known and everything their family has ever worked for, in order to maybe not actually change much at all.\n\nIn an ideal world they would absolutely do it for her, but in reality it's not always that easy. I imagine in their minds it's better for her to be unhappy but provided for and stable in a marriage she doesn't like, than ostracized and treated like an animal by their entire society for the rest of her life.", "You know, I really didn't think of that. If she is somewhere where she (and he) were force into an arranged marriage, they are most likely somewhere they take the honor/dishonor thing seriously enough to commit \"honor\" killings. Her life would be in danger.\n\nThat is so difficult for us to comprehend.", "Well that is considered adultery. We can agree though this is a messed up situation.", "NTA. \n\nIs there a possibility that money is attached to your marriage in some way? Cause the sudden change is suspicious and I don't blame you for questioning what's going on.", "Why did his family agree to the marriage if they didn't want it?\n\nBe careful. I lay bets that there is something about money that will happen if he stays with you.", "Nta Time to get a good lawyer and get that divorce.", "I\u2019m not going to give you a judgement, but I am going to tell you, if this is an arranged marriage and divorce isn\u2019t an option, then you\u2019re better off at least *pretending* to give him a chance and seeing if he\u2019s serious than being difficult. Unfortunately, it won\u2019t end well for you. I\u2019m not saying let your guard down, but forever is a long time, and it might make your life overall better if you two can figure out how to have some semblance of a real marriage.", "I don't depending on the culture I am concerned for her welfare.

This turns my stomach tbh.", "That information in hand, it\u2019s probably best for you to give him and his family a chance.

You never actually agreed to go. You can't skip something you never said you would go to. Throwing someone you were cruel to a birthday party as an apology is selfish. That party was never about you. Keep prioritizing yourself until you can figure something else out.", "Nta. Op your reaction is understandable,these are people who tormented you for the past five years. I'll agree with everyone else and say they want something from you. Though in there is a slight possibility that they might want a relationship with you either way op pliz be very,very cautious. Take a breather,visit relatives for a couple of days or years if that's possible. Good luck and stay safe!!!", "His family is probably putting pressure on him to have legal children.

Or is that taboo for your family, like most Indian families?

Insist on a sit down at a location of your choosing not some birthday party where you'll be blindsided and only meet with his family with people of your own that you trust being there with you. I'd go as far as to insist his uncle is also at any of these meetings. I'm not saying you should trust him to have YOUR best interests at heart, but they obviously respect or fear him, and having him as a witness while you are advocating for yourself could be helpful.\n\n Put down some strict ground rules with the lot of them. Remind them publicly that they are the ones that started this whole situation and repeatedly and openly disrespected you and allowed the girlfriend and wider community to look down upon you while you were trying hard to make the marriage work, that theyve behaved disgracefully to someone they were supposed to welcome snd protect and that from here going forward you demand both respect and distance from them while you and your husband try and figure this out.\n\n They don't have to like you but they do need to respect you, especially as they are gaining from this arrangement. It will also make it clear and remind them  that you are the one in control now and your husbands fate is in your hands. Most of all refuse to be quiet about all of this when dealing with your own family. Don't let your husbands family wear you down. If they ever manage to put you in isolation from your own people, things may not be as safe for you. So keep the conversation going with those you trust\n\n Remain dignified and calm and let them see the queen that you've grown to be due to their callousness. \n\n NTA. Most of us can't ever fully understand the ways of these arrangements but i wish you well with however you chose to go forward.", "This really depends on where \"here\" is. Sometimes, the law is on your side, but the culture is shit. For example, if you're in Egypt, you may have a chance. If you're in Afghanistan, you're screwed.\n\nA lot also depends on whether OP lives in a rural or urban area.
