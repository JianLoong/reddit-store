And what she's learning right now, aside from \"I ruined Mommy's life\" is \"Grandma thinks Mommy sucks\". That is TERRIBLE.\n\nTell your mother: *\"That's enough. If you want to share your views, we'll have to make a date out of earshot. Little pitchers have big ears, and mine has heard quite enough criticism and negativity from you.

Mom is the one being rude, insisting on forcing her opinions on you when you\u2019ve repeatedly asked her to stop.

She didn't listen to your \"no\" before, so its okay to get creative.", "Holy hell. NTA.\n\nYour mother should not be talking about adult issues in front of your child. If she wants to harangue you about your life choices, the least she could do is do it in private and not in front of your child. Please don't take this to mean I condone her haranguing you about anything. \n\nChildren should at all times be shielded from adult conflict, which is what you're obviously trying to do. If your mother can't respect this boundary, then perhaps you might consider limiting her interactions with you and your daughter.", "NTA at all and I applaud your creativity. \n\nI think Im going to start doing that with some of my coworkers!

Don't like the bio father? Cool. Can't exactly change that though, can you... so what is the point of her criticism?", "NTA But it is time to tell mom that if she can't respect you then she can't come over. You're a scant five minutes from your child repeating the things your mother is saying. It's time to be confrontational.", "NTA - Is it petty? A bit? Is it valid? Absolutely. Is it funny?
