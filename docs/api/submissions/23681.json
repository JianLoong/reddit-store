Your parents are just tenants in this home that you own ?\n\nI don't think that's the case.\n\nInstead I think your parents own this house and pay all of the bills. You visit occasionally and pay nothing other than maybe the occasional grocery ?\n\nThis is your parents home and it is silly to leave one of the main bedrooms empty in case you decide to visit. Somebody is living there full-time, your cousin. They should get the larger bedroom because they spend time there versus your occasional visiting.\n\nI understand it's hard to let go of things from our childhood but I think you said you are 30? It's time to let go of your childhood bedroom", "Yes exactly it\u2019s my first cousin and her husband, so my dad\u2019s niece, not my sibling"]}
