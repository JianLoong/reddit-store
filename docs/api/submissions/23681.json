How entitled!!", "NTA. What an entitled C.", "NTA because it's your room. NTA because it's your dad.", "NTA OP. I reckon these people are angling at your inheritance. They will claim they deserve money for everything they\u2019ve done", "NTA. Send them home.", "NTA, you also are an owner. Remind her she can go home.", "NTA. If your cousin doesn't like the accommodation, she can pay for a B&B.", "NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. I understand your dad is sick but why do they need to be there?", "NTA.. she is an entitled bully. No harm in asking nicely.. but this is just rude", "NTA \n\nThey can take their asses home if they don\u2019t like the arrangement. They live in the same city they go sleep in their own beds. They live 35 minutes away if they don\u2019t take their asses home instead of causing unnecessary stress.", "My husband and I were once given a couch to share overnight. Not a recliner. We ended taking the cushions off the couch and making a pad on the floor and then snuggling to sleep. Woke up not so much on it, but we were grateful for the place to sleep and made do. Even put the couch back together in the morning. (This was when we were in our early 20\u2019s and precovid.)", "At first I was thinking that your cousin was a distance away, hence why they were staying at your home. But only 35 minutes away?????  Oh no no no no no. They should be staying at their own home and driving over when it is appropriate to have visitors. Your mom needs to send them home ASAP!\n\nNTA", "NTA but your cousin is, especially for causing drama during a family crisis. \n\nTell her to go home if she wants more room. Oh and make sure throw in that it\u2019s YOUR home.", "NTA\n\nIt's time for Cousin's family to leave.  They aren't being helpful and are causing your family unnecessary stress.", "I have a brother in law that plays games with stuff like that. He moved in with my in-laws when they were sick \u201cto help\u201d and then didn\u2019t want to move out months later and wanted to make claim to living there. Even started having mail sent there. Eventually when they got better they called the cops. He then did the same thing with his uncle and is currently living in his house. I would be very careful with that.", "NTA.  How does she think it's ok to act like that as a guest? My mom was rude to many people but taught me to never be a brat as a guest in someone's home. Who raises these kind of people?", "NTA. She's got HER mum, HER husband, HER everything blowing up at you! Not your family doing this. \n\nTechnically it's your home. And it's certainly your room if your parents have kept it that way. I agree with your Mum that the house is tense but it's the cousin who is making it that way. She lives in the same city. If she doesn't want to stay at home, then hubby and baby can stay home while she stays in the guest room. Problem solved.", "NTA. Maybe they'd like to get a hotel room nearby, so they have plenty of space.", "When I had to moved into my parent's house, I took the double bedroom. Whenever my step brother stayed over with his kids. I gave him the room and slept in an airbed.\n\nThis was because, the two kids got the 2 single beds and he have a slipped disc (couple of surgeries) I did not want him on the sofa or an Airbed.\n\nAdditionally if the kids had nightmares there was space for them to join their dad. Lastly, as I was there I was usually the first one to get woken up as they wanted to play or have a go on my Switch. So gave my step brother a lie in as well.\n\nHowever, in this instance. She has a double bed and not a king? I mean, get over it.\n\nNTA, you could have swapped over to be nice, but it's ultimately, it's not like they are on two singles pushed together", "NTA. As co-owner of the house I think you should ask them to leave. They don\u2019t need to be there. They aren\u2019t helping. They are making things too tense.", "NTA, especially if it's literally your house!  What's wrong with a normal double?  Sure a super king might be more comfortable but it's ridiculous to stay in someone's house and demand to control which bed they get!", "Exactly. If they live in the same city, I don't understand why they're in OP's house to begin with.  I mean, I get that OP's dad is in poor health, but OP and mom are there to care for him. Cousin has no reason to be living there. It makes no sense. NTA.", "No they\u2019re not doing anything helpful nor do they have any medical expertise at all.\n\nConsensus here seems to be they\u2019ve seen that my dad is unwell and they\u2019re trying to either muscle in on the house or the will in general", "Sound fishy right", "OP is not a guest, their name is on the title", "No. It\u2019s not small at all. If I was staying there as a guest with my husband and child I would be fine with it. I\u2019ve stayed in smaller rooms at a hotel lol", "This the one. In addition, while not ideal 2 average adults can usually share a double bed just fine (unless they\u2019re really tall or generally larger), the child is in a separate cot. If they don\u2019t like it they can go home, at this moment there is absolutely no reason for them to be there except to push your buttons lol or appear that they \u201ccare more\u201d or just as much as you cause they are the ones that are \u201calways there\u201d. NTA, your cousins are displaying entitlement.", "Is their housing situation stable?  This feels like a squatter situation.", "Isn't there child already in a cot?", "They want go away money. Or maybe they are broke again and are getting free food. I'd say they are causing more stress than being there to cheer up your father. Seems like there is an ulterior motive. Don't give up your room. NTA.", "Are your part of the family like waaay better of than their's and are they the only once doing this in your extended family? Do they do this to others in your family too? And if not, why so? They sound nothing more than leaches.", "NTA. Send the leaches home. They live close enough that they can visit if they find it absolutely necessary but right now they're not even helping.", "\"She may well be livid but making a rational decision that blowing up at them may be the end entire family, permanently.\" .. Better than letting yourself be abused.", "I would put a lock to get into your room, if she does want to stay long term I could see her trying to move herself in.", "I was wondering that too. My first thought is I wonder if they know she owns the house too.", "Understatement of the century.", "Then its even more clear cut imo; definitely nta. \n\nI cant imagine starting an issue just to have slightly more comfort while already being comfortable", "[removed]", "Right? 35 minutes is about how long it takes me to get to the grocery store. I don\u2019t understand why they are staying with you. I assumed they were at least a few hours away. I wonder if there\u2019s something they aren\u2019t telling and that\u2019s why they insist on staying? Did they get evicted? Are they having their house remodeled or bug bombed?", "[removed]", "It would be! Which is why I find the whole thing ridiculous!", "Also, why their whole family?  Why isn't only the cousin staying?\n\nThere's possible reasons why the husband is staying. If the husband is a doctor, it'd be beneficial to have someone with medical expertise around.", "Yeah I wish it was that easy! We are of Indian origin and there is a whole lot of community and social pressure about maintaining \u201cfamily ties\u201d", "I doubt it, seeing as they\u2019re demanding her room.", "I didn\u2019t ever say that cousin has moved in to help out my family. You misunderstood.\n\nI said that she \u201cdecided to stay at our house because my dad is not feeling well.\u201d They\u2019ve slept here for two nights now. Nobody said anything about moving in as a carer.\n\nAs to your second point maybe you are correct. The problem is that my family is originally Indian and the \u201cfamily before everything else\u201d mentality is drummed into us. So even when people ask for outlandish stuff we are expected to just go along with it. No matter how much it may upset us.\n\nHowever I think this time my mum is over it. I\u2019m giving her and dad space for a few more hours and then I\u2019m going to talk to them x", "Stolen comment. Downvote and report.", "Stolen comment. Runns_with_scissors has the original.", "Are they hoping to be in a will or something? Very strange behaviour", "They are there to grow roots and take over when your father dies. It\u2019s predatory and transparently so. Vultures waiting for your father to pass - they will then boss around your mum and essentially take over the house. It will be a mess of a situation. Do not under any circumstances allow them out of the guest room / and check your tenant laws. Make sure mum knows not to let them overstay their welcome when you\u2019re not there.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be that bad.  Just tell them to get the F out as they have no valid reason to be there and their presence is creating a problem.  They\u2019ll be called if they\u2019re needed.  Now GTFO."]}
