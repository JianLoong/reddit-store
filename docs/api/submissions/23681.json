But they can go home and sleep in their own beds at night.", "Dear cousin, thank you for visiting dad but he needs absolute quiet, which is impossible with too many people staying at the house.  Short visits are permissible if he feels up to it, please ask in advance.  These are the doctor's orders.", "Yea I do that\u2019s why they want your room. I would purchase a lock and key for my door. The minute they get the opportunity they will move their stuff in your room.", "They clearly feel like they\u2019re more entitled to the space than you, so that\u2019s a very real possibility, especially since your parents are helping them with money.", "If you don't mind me asking, I've always been curious about how this dynamic actually works in cultures that have it. For instance, is it actually obvious to a hypothetical observer that you asking them to go home so your father can rest is beyond the pale of acceptable things to say to family, but her screaming at you to get out of your own bedroom is not? Or is she just taking advantage of your concern over appropriate behavior while ignoring that concern herself? Not trying to be offensive, I'm just genuinely curious.", "My niece used to stay with me sometimes when she was a toddler. I would wake up with her asleep across the top of the bed with her feet against my neck", "I\u2019m not like being a d about it I\u2019m just saying I\u2019ve seen mostly gender neutral people use it instead of sibling and it\u2019s fresh to see it used differently. Ty for the rando downvote like I was purposely being a jerk or something.", "Plot twist, their homeless just hiding it.", "So you mean OP has to give his room to the cousin? How? Lol why do they get the priviledge? You sound so ignorant!", "Sorry i got the same picture on your OP. I originally thought your father was in a very bad state and your cousins were there helping with keeping up things in your house.  \nI think most of the TA comments may think that way as well.  \nIf they are just making things harder and not helping tell them to kick rocks", "I'm in my 70s, and when I was growing up, there was no such thing as queen or king beds.  There were just what were called double beds, or what is now called a full bed.\n\nCousin and family can go to their own home, since they live in the same city.  OP is NTA.", "Me(28F) and my husband(34M) had to leave a dangerous living situation of where we were living- causing us to uproot our lives and literally move half way across the country. As a result we couldn\u2019t bring our king sized bed and my in laws opened up their home to us free of cost, and even helped us financially somewhat with the move.\n\nThe other details don\u2019t matter: but the guest room they have opened up to us is one that they prepared for him whenever he ever chose to visit.\n\nThe bed that is in the room is a double/full sized bed\u2026 \n\nMe and him are not huge people by any means\u2026 but we are NOT skinny. We both are 100% overweight and could be way healthier. While we are child free- I can tell you that doesn\u2019t stop 3 of our animals (dogs and maybe even 1-2 cats) from hopping up on the bed with us. \n\n(Edit: just for reference since other commenters were commenting, I am 5\u201d2 162lbs and my husband is 5\u201d11 213LBS and we can fit easily)\n\nThere is enough room that even with 3-4 of the animals jumping on top that neither of us are uncomfortable. \n\nMy point: the kid isn\u2019t even in the bed with them because OPs already offered up her own child\u2019s cot so they can be more comfortable.\n\nOP is NTA and it sounds like OPs cousin and her husband are slowly closing in on OP and their mother and fathers disadvantaged situation so they can probably start squatting\u2026. This feels like some r/choosingbeggars energy too.", "my 5'1\" wife can easily take up 70% of the bed too!", "Knew it!!!! Now it makes sense that they want you to give up your bed and your room. Make sure they don't try to change anyone's will while they are there. Why are they there for so long? They are not physically taking care of a patient. I would suggest they have overstayed their welcome.", "Maybe it doesn\u2019t matter if what they have is \u201cenough\u201d. \n\nIf someone else has something \u201cbetter\u201d than they must be given \u201cbetter\u201d (regardless of whose or what it is)  or the world is unfairly denying them something that\u2019s their right to have.\n\nThey need to be grateful for the guest room or leave. Perhaps it\u2019s time to ask them why they haven\u2019t gone home since you and your mother can care for your father, and when someone is sick it is in poor taste to impose yourself onto the family and bother them to host you. \n\nWhen their mommy calls to harass you again, express your disappointment because you thought she raised them better than this.", "Dude! You cant kick an owner of the house to give you the room they want! and who the fucks stay in someone\u2019s house with a husband with her? Sound like they want to take the house when the dad dies!", "Okay, I managed to miss the fact OP and their child were in their room. That changes things", "I'm referring to OPs toddler not her cousin's 10 month old.", "^^ This. My Spouse is almost 6'1\", can't do a double bed because we don't have enough room.", "And a double is less than 1.5 times as wide as a twin (only 16\" wider.)", "Did you miss the part where the cousin lives only 30 mins away, OP is a co-owner of the house and these freeloaders are not helping the household in any way?", "Yes I did missed the part where they are free loaders because I couldn't read 690 comments as I don't live on Reddit. Also I was commenting more in general regarding the overall attitude and not necessarily specifically about them because surprise surprise...we don't know those people", "I mean. That hardly addresses what I was asking... And the last part is very jurisdiction dependant", "No, your husband is just being nice and not complaining.  He's longer than the bed.", "Yup. There are a couple of candidates who support freeloading.", "My Mrs is 5\u20192\u201d\nI\u2019m always amazed at how easily someone so small can take up all the bed. I would do something about it but she scares me.", "Kind of bogus to speculate on things that have been repeatedly asked and answered and even spelled out in the OP's post. but you got your moment on your soapbox.", "Yes! I say all the time that my 6 year old sleeps like an octopus! I swear, she has 4 more limbs to touch my with when she comes to my bed!\nNTA", "To be fair I do think it started in the non-binary community for themselves. It just took off pretty quickly", "Also, they are not helping.", "Yup. It might seem like not a lot looking at the numbers but that extra room is the difference between comfort and feeling crammed for me and my SO.", "I think maybe you just got confused on the context. It's relatively new and I've only ever heard it used as a gender neutral version of niece/nephew", "I\u2019ve def seen it when referencing non-binary siblings before maybe it just didn\u2019t stick to a trend idk tbh", "Assuming your desi everything makes sense now!! Don\u2019t let your entitled relatives take over if they\u2019re unhappy they can go back to their own home :)", "A double is pitiful for two people.  Buy a queen size mattress!  Be a good host!"]}
