Keeps it out of probate.  \n\nCurrently, as joint tenants, only your parents' portion of the house will have a step up in cost basis when they die.  Which means more taxes for you to pay when you eventually sell it (assuming you plan to sell when they pass).", "NTA.\n\nBeyond the toxic entitlement on display just wanting your room, your cousin actually has the gall to DEMAND it!\n\nLet her go back to their house all those 35 minutes away!", "Nta. Why is your cousin there with her spouse & child? Doesnt your dad deserve peace, quite & time w his family. If its a must visit, she comes alone, says what she needs to & leaves. Thats respect. I hated when ppl stopped by just to see my mom die. If you cant visit when shes able to enjoy it, dont bother now", "Wow - just WOW!  NTA\n\nI\u2019m possibly slightly too jaded now but this whole thing doesn\u2019t make logical sense to me for them to need to sleep over when they live nearby\u2026\u2026 What\u2019s their angle/play here?? Are they trying to weasel in for an inheritance from your dad or possibly your mom? Why would a husband of a cousin willingly sleep on a double bed in someone else\u2019s house otherwise???? \n\nI smell something fishy", "Given the way that you said they went about it, they can absolutely get wrecked. Demanding and guilt tripping and yelling \ud83e\udd28 . Are they ginormous and can't fit in a double bed? Stand your ground. They can go get a hotel, or go back home given that they live nearby. NTA", "NTA\n\nApparently they've never slept with a toddler...\ud83e\udd23\n\nThey will be fine. Geeze a double bed is enough for two adults and a baby if needed. She sounds entitled and spoiled. They can opt not to stay if it puts them out that bad.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your bed, in a home you still part own. They have a double and a cot for their child. If you wanted to, you could offer but in NO WAY are you obliged too and especially if its your personal space.", "Your cousins can go home if the accommodations aren't suitable. It's only a few miles away. NTA.", "Simple solution. Send cousin home", "NTA\n\n\nMaybe if she had asked nicely...but the way she approached you, with instant hostility and entitlement, blows that right out the water. They don't have to be staying at the house. They could go home and visit. They love your parents and want to be close so they came to stay.  And we're granted a stay. They could just get a hotel nearby or rent an RV to park in the drive or something. \n\nShe can let her child out to move about whenever she likes as well. \n\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t understand these posts. Clearly NTA. Posting for karma I guess.", "NTA", "NTA, they should go home, their sense of entitlement is mind boggling.", "NTA just because she demanded and then started screaming. Otherwise, it would have been N A H\n\nBut I would like to know if cousin's family is a benefit to your father? Because if they're doing you a favor and helping out, it might be nice if you did this to make that favor easier.\n\nNow if they're just causing problems for your parents while they're their and you want them to go home sooner, good move keeping your bed.", "If she has a problem with it, go find an airbnb or a hotel. \n\nNTA, the entitlement is insane", "NTA - they are now overstepping and need to go home.", "tell her to go get your own house", "NTA why is your cousin really there, when they live 35 min away? That makes NO sense. How is two babies in a house good for your sick dad? Also, since when does a cousin rate over a daughter. Who also owns part of the house? They like where they are or they go home.", "I suspect your cousin and her husband plan to take over the house by staying there to \"help\" your parents. They will gradually or not so gradually make decisions about the house starting with moving into your room. Since you are an owner, I would make them leave immediately and establish strict visiting hours where they don't stay over, like once a week for an hour or two. If they won't leave, call the police. Clearly they don't give a shit about your dad since they engage in yelling at you about your room. They are negatively impacting your dad's health.", "NTA. Next time they bring up the kid, say \u201cno thank you I\u2019m on a diet!\u201d", "NTA. Your parents have been helping them out financially so now they're trying to make a big show of being involved. They aren't really helping and they live in town.

That\u2019s their only two options and the more they and your aunt try to pressure you, the more you\u2019re likely to lean towards kicking them out.\nNTA", "Nobody screams at you in your own home. You are NTAH. I'd tell her to kiss my bottom.", "NTA, it's your room. And that bed is for your and your toddler to sleep comfortably in. Especially, since you lent her your baby's own bed. Like others said here, don't give in to them. They are just venting their frustrations out at you.    \n\nAlso, I drive 40 minutes to work every day. I don't see why they have to stay overnight. Traffic tends to be lighter at nighttime anyways, so it may be even a shorter drive for them to get home at night.", "How is screaming at you and staying in your house with a crying baby helping your parents at all? They\u2019re just stressing everybody out and need to leave.\n\nHave you asked your dad if he even wants them there?", "AGREE WITH YOU.", "I second this, block your aunt / Uncle who are blowing you up about this. And your mom needs to put her foot wherever she believes it should be, instead of dancing around waiting for you two sort it out. And I would hope that she would take your side.", "Don\u2019t underestimate the drive in some people to please\u2026 especially with family. \n\nShe may well be livid but making a rational decision that blowing up at them may be the end entire family, permanently.", "And she shouldn\u2019t even be there in the first place!", "Lol it\u2019s okay I\u2019m feeling overly petty too, my son woke me up with a kick to the ribs but somehow he\u2019s still fast asleep! \ud83d\ude02", "OP is also o. The title", "Dont forget the NTA!", "Please see my previous comments, all these queries have been answered in full already", "I'm not sure why you think what you're against is relevant to the lives of people who clearly aren't against it.", "Probably mentioned after your comment but OP has said several times now that the cousin and her family are not helping in any way, shape, or form.

That's your room, with your sentimental attachments to it, and which has been your private space and should remain such, if the family, including you, deems fit.\n\nHow would you possibly not get a special claim on your own room from your own childhood in your own house?\n\nEven if your name isn't on the deed, it would only be courteous, if you're staying over, for your parents or whoever owns the house to give you your own room.\n\nYou totally get a special claim on it. Sometimes sentiment matters. This is one of those times.", "But her name is on the title to the house, so yea, she does get a special claim to the bedroom", "It's not just the bedroom she had as a kid.

My FIL had been supporting his brother's family financially. They had a shared property from my husband's grandpa. The brother who was suppoted by my FIL stole the property. Maybe your cousin is acting this way because she wants to imbed herself with your parents and later take wealth from them. There's no logical reason why she would be staying at the house, which is so close to her own home.", "OP owns the house.", "Not a lease. She is on the title which means she is the owner.", "Yes it is.
