Wow, you really spoiled her and now she\u2019s acting bratty", "NTA but I think you need to limit how much you give her to what you think will genuinely be her spending money because it seems obvious that is what your father is doing -- extra cash just goes to the lazy uncle.\n\nIt could be that your father isn't actually close to financially \"abusive\" but just doesn't want to be financially abused himself, and so prevents his hard-earned cash going to a parasite via your mother.\n\nYour mother herself sounds kind of lazy and ungrateful, not even wanting to drive to pick up your money -- that she wants to give away to someone she knows you don't want to give it to.", "NTA- now you know where all the money you gave you mother went\u2026 stop funding your uncle through your mother\u2026", "NTA for taking the money back. You would be the AH if you still keep giving mom money, now that you know where it goes.\n\nIf you want to support her brother, you should give him the money directly.

I would tend to be extra unwilling to deliver the money, knowing that it will be subsidizing uncle. Your mum has become dependent on what you give her, and that is a bad thing.

At first I thought that your dad was for limiting what she has on hand but actually as the story progresses it was clear he does this because he knows his money would otherwise be wasted. And you should realize that too. The fact that you\u2019re still willing to give it to her is telling: you\u2019re very kind to her.
