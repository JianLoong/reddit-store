But if I didn't have my walker, I would be unable to do pretty much anything outside my own home.\n\nI went to Dollywood several weeks ago with two friends. Since I can't stand in line, I get a disability pass that lets me and my friends skip the line. Say the ride has a 30 minute wait\u2014we can skip the line and ride at 10:30 and they will mark it down on my paper, and then at 11:00 we can skip the line to ride another ride. In practice, it's a bit more bang for your buck than the people actually waiting because the time spent riding the ride and then walking to the next one is a freebie. But the alternative would be me not being able to go on any rides at all.\n\nI posted some pics from the trip on Instagram and said something like \"Cripple perk: No lines \ud83d\ude0e\" in one post. Some girl that I vaguely know saw the post and was MAD. She left a bunch of comments on my trip photos saying it was fucked up to call an accomodation a \"perk,\" I'm making the disabled community look bad, it's people like me who make it harder for people to get accommodations, and so on. A couple other randos started joining in with accusatory comments insinuating that I lied to get a pass when I could have actually waited in line, so I just deleted the whole post and blocked everyone who had left negative comments.\n\nMy thought was that it's my disability, 99.9% of it just plainly sucks, so I should be able to use and enjoy the rare upsides without feeling bad about it.
