I can walk short distances without it (and even medium distances on a good day) and look \"normal\" until my legs start to give out, so I often get accused of faking my disability by strangers who think they're clever little detectives. But if I didn't have my walker, I would be unable to do pretty much anything outside my own home.\n\nI went to Dollywood several weeks ago with two friends. Since I can't stand in line, I get a disability pass that lets me and my friends skip the line. Say the ride has a 30 minute wait\u2014we can skip the line and ride at 10:30 and they will mark it down on my paper, and then at 11:00 we can skip the line to ride another ride. In practice, it's a bit more bang for your buck than the people actually waiting because the time spent riding the ride and then walking to the next one is a freebie. But the alternative would be me not being able to go on any rides at all.\n\nI posted some pics from the trip on Instagram and said something like \"Cripple perk: No lines \ud83d\ude0e\" in one post. Some girl that I vaguely know saw the post and was MAD. She left a bunch of comments on my trip photos saying it was fucked up to call an accomodation a \"perk,\" I'm making the disabled community look bad, it's people like me who make it harder for people to get accommodations, and so on. A couple other randos started joining in with accusatory comments insinuating that I lied to get a pass when I could have actually waited in line, so I just deleted the whole post and blocked everyone who had left negative comments.\n\nMy thought was that it's my disability, 99.9% of it just plainly sucks, so I should be able to use and enjoy the rare upsides without feeling bad about it. But it's also hard enough as it is, and if that really is a douchey thing to say then I can own up to it.", "created_utc": 1682895922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1345tiq/aita_for_calling_a_lineskipping_pass_a_perk_of/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's be honest. On the scales of negatives vs positives of being disabled the negatives vastly overwhelm the handful of positives.\n\nYou get preferred parking.\n\nPriority boarding (but not disembarking) airplanes.\n\nAnd to skip a line.\n\n\nCalling it a perk is just making yourself feel a little better when dealing with a world that, most of the time barely works for you even WITH accommodations.", "NTA, YOU'RE the one with a disability, you can make whatever jokes you want. My husband got injured in the military and is now disabled and he's constantly saying shit like that. Just because you make a joke or are able to enjoy some of the accommodations doesn't negate your issues or struggles or those of anyone else. \n\nThey're just made they've got to wait in line \ud83d\ude1d", "NTA. You're not part of the reason it's harder to get accommodations, because you have a legitimate disability. In the last decade or so, there *has* been some controversy, mainly with Disney, that people discovered they didn't require proof of disability to get their pass, so they would fake being disabled to skip the lines. In response Disney changed their DAS policies to prevent people from skipping the lines, but still people find a way to take advantage of it. Your friends are acting as though you are part of *that* crowd, that's not disabled and just looking to cut the lines- but that's not the case at all. Are you sure these people are your friends?", "NTA you're allowed to make the best of the shitty hand life dealt you.

Say hi to Zuul for me.\" If she's a Ghostbusters fan, she'll understand.", "NTA Having a disability sucks and you're allowed to joke about it all you want because it's your disability.

Although I don't think you'll ever want to go to an amusement park with her.", "Nta. Life sucks sometimes. We can moan and cry about it. Or we can look to the bright moments that make it better.

My husband has a TBI with seizures and unless he is having one or he shaves his hair and you see the giant scars people think he is just fine and harassing comments all the time. Many people get upset that anyone gets any advantage or perk above them. And so many don't understand invisible disabilities at all.

NTA!\n\nAnyone who doesn't have your specific disabilities gets no say in things like this.

I also am a fan of gallows humor. It absolutely wouldn't be ok for ME to make that joke about YOU, but you're absolutely in the clear to make it for yourself. As for the person that called you out, I think the blatant virtue signalling is more of a dick move than some dark self-deprecating humor.", "NTA.   People on the internet can be very reactive.
