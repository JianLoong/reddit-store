{"id": 25621, "submission_id": "162k56z", "title": "AITA for not telling the woman I work for that i'm transgender?", "selftext": "Before I start this I want to make everyone aware that I have fully medically transitioned. Ive had Top Surgery, Ive been on Testosterone for almost 7 years now and I fully pass as a male. So Im a nanny, I sadly had a really hard time in school when I was younger due to my mental health and couldn't keep up with my schoolwork causing me to not be able to get into college.  So I decided instead of going to community college I would use the money I saved for college from working to fully medically transition. It was great, I had finally felt good in my body and was truly happy for the first time. Money was scarce and I love kids so I decided to start babysitting. One of my First jobs Was a nice single mom, we'll call her Lily. Her husband had died pretty early on in the pregnancy so she's been alone from the start. Her kid- Lets call him Ryan is a a pretty hyper kid. And Before you say \"Isn't every kid a little hyper?\" no. I mean this kid is ***hyper*** like he is bounce off the walls hyper. So when she came home one night from a long night at work to peaceful sleeping child she was overjoyed, and she has continuously told me that is one of the main reasons she hired me. I quickly became Ryan's full time nanny. Teaching His mom How to make things like brushing his teeth or eating fun for him. She always praises me and tells me what good of a man I am and how she is so impressed on how feminine and motherly I am to children. Which yes, kinda rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nMy mother every once and awhile comes and visits, and this past weekend she was in town so she decided to come visit. We were walking around the local farmers market catching up when we ran into Ryan and his mom. I have weekends off but it is always nice to see Ryan outside of when i'm babysitting him so I went and said hi and introduced the two to my mom. Lily and my mom hit it off immediately and my mom asked that they become facebook friends. Now I don't have facebook  so Ive never actually seen my moms posts. So It was my surprise when Lily sent me a Facebook post about my transition- made by my mom. Lily went off on me, She started cursing me out, calling me slurs of all kind, and telling me I should be ashamed of myself. She told me that The only reason she hired me was because I was a Man and she wanted for Ryan to have a father figure in his life. She continued to lecture me about \"how ill always be a woman.\" and how she cant believe she let a monster touch her child. I am shattered. I cant believe that this woman that I trusted and that was becoming one of my closest friends was a transphobic monster. I have been cut out from her and Ryans life completely and she has blocked me on everything.\n\nI admit I know it was wrong to not tell her that I was trans but I consider that something very private due to it being something that I can get harmed for. I know it is not my fault for what Lily belives but I still feel guilty about letting Ryan live with that woman.

Once you are confirmed to have socially transitioned, you get a new drivers license with your current photo, and your old one is sealed away only for legal and archival purposes. I suppose, if they found out that 20 years ago when you were still presenting as the wrong gender that you had committed a murder, they could haul it out and use it in court, but otherwise it's just a record, about as important as the fact that two people who are now dead got married in the 1920s.", "So when I\u2019m babysitting, all my clients need to know I\u2019m a lesbian?!

The mom is simply a bigot who is pissed OP passed so well that she couldn\u2019t tell he was trans. \n\nI\u2019d also like to suggest that the mom who hired OP is very attracted to OP and is now mortified to know they found a trans dude attractive lol", "Protect the kid from what exactly?", "You\u2019ve got the stats backward, but I think you know that.

I\u2019m not at all saying you should disclose gender and wouldn\u2019t have even thought to do so.  But my experience is in the corporate world.

I don\u2019t know if the same legal discrimination rules apply or do most people (if they care) usually hire somebody where they know the background?  I was really just considering something I\u2019d never thought of before and shouldn\u2019t have offered an opinion.

You don't ask if people have Asian fetishes? Like if you only want to bang Asian women (compared to only wanting to bang men), isn't that a ... thing? Like being into big butts and I cannot lie? Why does this matter?\n\n2. the disability section - I could not believe my f'ing eyes the list got longer and longer with each place - now disability includes autism, adhd, major depressive disorder, major anxiety disorder (then later in the list), depression, anxiety, (!!!! the regular versions!?) - \n\nalso - adhd!?!?\n\nDude I'm not declaring that shit. \n\nSo yeah it irritated me. Regular depression? Fuck them.\n\nAlso only maybe 20-30% of the banks asked the gay question, a lot of them didn't which is why it just doesn't seem appropriate (to me) when measuring diversity.", "I started on the indeed app recently looking for jobs and they ask that on your profile.
