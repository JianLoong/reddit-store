{"id": 25621, "submission_id": "162k56z", "title": "AITA for not telling the woman I work for that i'm transgender?", "selftext": "Before I start this I want to make everyone aware that I have fully medically transitioned. Ive had Top Surgery, Ive been on Testosterone for almost 7 years now and I fully pass as a male. So Im a nanny, I sadly had a really hard time in school when I was younger due to my mental health and couldn't keep up with my schoolwork causing me to not be able to get into college.  So I decided instead of going to community college I would use the money I saved for college from working to fully medically transition. It was great, I had finally felt good in my body and was truly happy for the first time. Money was scarce and I love kids so I decided to start babysitting. One of my First jobs Was a nice single mom, we'll call her Lily. Her husband had died pretty early on in the pregnancy so she's been alone from the start. Her kid- Lets call him Ryan is a a pretty hyper kid. And Before you say \"Isn't every kid a little hyper?\" no. I mean this kid is ***hyper*** like he is bounce off the walls hyper. So when she came home one night from a long night at work to peaceful sleeping child she was overjoyed, and she has continuously told me that is one of the main reasons she hired me. I quickly became Ryan's full time nanny. Teaching His mom How to make things like brushing his teeth or eating fun for him. She always praises me and tells me what good of a man I am and how she is so impressed on how feminine and motherly I am to children. Which yes, kinda rubbed me the wrong way.\n\nMy mother every once and awhile comes and visits, and this past weekend she was in town so she decided to come visit. We were walking around the local farmers market catching up when we ran into Ryan and his mom. I have weekends off but it is always nice to see Ryan outside of when i'm babysitting him so I went and said hi and introduced the two to my mom. Lily and my mom hit it off immediately and my mom asked that they become facebook friends. Now I don't have facebook  so Ive never actually seen my moms posts. So It was my surprise when Lily sent me a Facebook post about my transition- made by my mom. Lily went off on me, She started cursing me out, calling me slurs of all kind, and telling me I should be ashamed of myself. She told me that The only reason she hired me was because I was a Man and she wanted for Ryan to have a father figure in his life. She continued to lecture me about \"how ill always be a woman.\" and how she cant believe she let a monster touch her child. I am shattered. I cant believe that this woman that I trusted and that was becoming one of my closest friends was a transphobic monster. I have been cut out from her and Ryans life completely and she has blocked me on everything.\n\nI admit I know it was wrong to not tell her that I was trans but I consider that something very private due to it being something that I can get harmed for. I know it is not my fault for what Lily belives but I still feel guilty about letting Ryan live with that woman.

I\u2019m so glad for you that you were able to become your true self.  That takes so much courage!  \n\nI\u2019m kind of pissed at your mom though, for putting all of this on her FB without discussing it with you.  That\u2019s pretty crappy.  I\u2019m so sorry.\n\nLily needs to clean her conscience.", "NTA.\n\nHer reaction is disgusting. You don\u2019t have to tell anyone anything about your past. \n\nI honestly feel sorry for Ryan.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let this transphobe hurt you a second longer. You are a man. She wanted a romantic relationship and is angry at herself. Not your problem.", "Makes me wonder if mom did it underhandedly on purpose. Maybe mom isn\u2019t as ok with it as it might appear", "It is up to you who+/if you come out to. Definitely NTA", "You had no obligation to tell her. You aren't dating her and planning to have kids with her. She had literally zero reason to know your private medical business.", "If you\u2019d like an example of a normal human response to finding out your trans, this is what I would do: \n\nSpend the next 48 hours stressing whether I said anything that you might have taken offence to or that could be seen as insensitive, so that I could apologise.\n\nNTA", "I'm also a trans man, NTA. This was a working relationship, and being fully stealth is completely normal for professional relationships. I'm sorry it happened like this, but I think she wanted more than just a nanny for her kid, despite what you may have wanted or thought.", "NTA\n\nIt was in no way wrong to not tell your employer your private medical history.", "NTA. its none of her business, and you're not obligated to tell her about it", "Thank you for the correction.  I misspoke.", "I\u2019m sorry but this doesn\u2019t sound even remotely real.", "Nta it's not any of her business", "NTA- forget all the \u201cfather figure\u201d stuff because that\u2019s B.S. she\u2019s just a transphobic witch. \nThere\u2019s nothing to being a father figure that would involve you being transgender. You\u2019re a father figure or you\u2019re not. The details of how you were born don\u2019t really matter to the kid. She has super gross opinions. You\u2019re fine.", "OP, I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. Your AGAB is completely irrelevant to your occupation, and you didn\u2019t owe her anything except the dutiful care of her son. \n\nI hope you find a new job soon.", "There is nothing in your job duties that requires a Y chromosome.  So NTA. Also you ARE a man despite what crazy mother says.  Mom sucks and I feel so bad for Ryan who had a male role model he loved who was abruptly taken away because Mom is a raging transphobe.", ">I admit I know it was wrong to not tell her that I was trans\n\nNo! Stop it! Your private medical information is nobody's business but yours, your doctor's and people you choose to tell. I'm sorry this happened to you but the bigots have no right to your life. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt's none of her business.", "NTA - you aren't required to tell anyone your status. There are even plenty of biological males that act motherly and \"feminine\" (I would even do \"masculine\" in the same fashion, likewise for fatherly). It boiled down to parental approach for how to get children to get them to do what is needed - like brushing teeth. \n\nYour mother isn't a TA either, she sounds very supportive of your transition. Didn't even sound like she was receiving hate for her posts either.  I feel bad for Ryan, cause I can see him being taught to hate those that are different than him, even if they do not look different. \n\nThis is also why I avoid talking about certain things in social media, too many extremists on the left and right, ready to twist things to fit their own agenda or narrative.", "Look, I'm not even gonna read that\n\nthe answer is NTA\n\nYou dont owe your private medical history to anyone except *maybe* your doctor", "I hope your mom is planning to make up for your lost employment wtf?", "Hiring a nanny is a discriminatory process by definition. How many male nannies have you seen? Or kindergarden teachers, for that matter? \n\nThis is not about OP. This is about the mother\u2019s right to decide who babysits her child. No one has \u201dthe right\u201d to be trusted with the kids of another person. No matter whether they are cis, trans, old, young. You have to earn the trust by being honest, trustworthy and reliable. Some mothers simply will not trust their young kids to anyone, and never hire help. Most will not trust them to men. And consent can always be withdrawn. The nanny does something that sits badly with the mother or kid and they can be out, as simple as that.\n\nMany people take a lot of care when choosing nanny. They vet them, interview them, ask for references. It is not an employment as any other - you are very close to a small human being who\u2019s vulnerable and highly susceptible.\n\nHere you have a mother who was looking for a specific kind of nanny for her child. Is it so inconceivable to be shocked when finding out that the person you trusted to care for your child was not what you thought? And how could you further trust a person who\u2019s not open and forthcoming?\n\nI\u2019m sorry that this happened to all of you. But YTA. Now you know that people do care about this. You can\u2019t expect everyone to think the same as you. If you honestly care about the kids of others I hope that you can be open about yourself in the future. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find plenty of work with people who are more tolerant.", ">I admit I know it was wrong to not tell her that I was trans.\n\nNo it wasn't, don't tell yourself that and don't let anyone else tell you that. It is no one's business but your's, your doctor's, and your future (or current) partner's business. NTA, bigots are the monsters.", "Very solid NTA. It\u2019s not her or anyone else\u2019s business what gender you are in the first place unless you deem them close enough to know. It\u2019s a sensitive topic on its own especially in today\u2019s political climate. If someone can\u2019t be friends or even _be friendly_ with you because of your identity then they can excuse themselves.", "NTA\n\nWhat does gender have to do with babysitting? Was she going to ask you if you were a lesbian if you had been a woman? Did she ask you about your sexual orientation when she hired you? Or did she just assume you are an AMAB heterosexual man from the get go?\nHer reasoning makes no sense because it\u2019s based on discrimination.\n\nYou are perfectly capable of taking care of Ryan regardless of who you are.\nShe is transphobic. I\u2019m sorry you had to be subjected to her words.", "Tell your mom what happened.  Ask her if she is ok with friends like that?  Ask her to take down all her posts of your transition because you'd like some privacy.  If she doesn't , it could be because she likes the attention it brings her.  Facebook really isn't about intimate support friends.\n\nRegardless,  put mom on an information diet and you might want to keep more of a firewall between your family and your acquaintances/career.  Friends/lovers will be on your side ... but others, not so much. \n\nSorry this happened.  You were right not to tell her.  You view yourself as a man and you should present yourself this way.  Your history as a woman should be (mostly) irrelevant.", "This.", "What is funny is that many parents would not have hired him in the first place because of his gender identity - cis or trans - since many parents are suspicious of male caregivers. She probably thought she was being pretty open minded and progressive by trusting a dude to watch her kid. Only to fire him when she decided he was female.", "U r shitty person", "It doesn't make one an AH to be transphobic towards someone else?", "The term You're looking for is Cis man, not \"bio man\" not \"real man\" just cis man\n\"biological man\" is a transphobic dogwhistle term that's used to dehumanise trans people and imply we are imitations of cis people rather than biological humans in our own right", "Did OP say the mom did it without his permission?", "Nope. Lily loved having a very nurturing man around and was starting to catch feelings.", "Oh yeah most people have no idea what their chromosomes actually are. I mean people don't go around testing for it and we just tend to go off what physical traits we have.\n\nYou can have XXY chromosomes and never know! Often people find out through fertility testing or when checking for other genetic factors for their health, or at birth or during puberty if there's noticeable traits. The intersex community has a lot of stories about the topic.", "Because I can't hook up with a confused lady that cut her tits off?? Look, I fucking tried.", ">Now I don't have facebook  so Ive never actually seen my moms posts. So It was my surprise when Lily sent me a Facebook post about my transition- made by my mom. \n\nIt's between the lines. Him having no idea about his mom posting about his transition online means his mom clearly did not ask for permission. If she asked he would have known (and most probably would have said no).", "Some people are just insecure about being attracted to a trans person.", "Childhood and medication is not remotely the same thing. If a guy doesn't want to have sex with someone who used to be a man or vice-versa it would be very fucked up to hide that from them.", "That moment when you're about to have sex a woman and suddenly you find a dong in between her legs \ud83d\udc80, ofc they'd have the right to know", "He did disclose his gender, which is male. What he didn\u2019t disclose is his biological sex, which remains technically female despite the surgeries and hormone treatments, but is no longer relevant. His chromosomal sex at this point is an underlying medical condition requiring medical management, but we do not disclose medical conditions unless accommodations are being requested.", "Ah my bad! Sorry I am also trans without social media and could see my mom doing this with no ill intent but you make a good point.", "We also don\u2019t know how far back Lily scrolled to find this information", "From every source that I can find this does not seem to be correct.  Nannies are protected under the same basic anti-discrimination laws as every employee, at federal and state levels, and in some states have additional rights under the law.  I'm not sure where you got your information, but I don't think it is correct.", "Then that's on them, not their casual partner.", "What do you mean mom \u201cdidn\u2019t do anything wrong\u201d? In what universe is it appropriate to make any statement on social media, however congratulatory, about your child\u2019s private medical information without their consent?", "Didn't do anything wrong? She posted something about her son that she should have never posted and the only reason she felt confident doing it is because her son was not on Facebook! I wonder what else she posts that OP doesn't know about? I wonder how many social medias she talks about OP on? This woman's out of control... This is not her story to tell! She simply gossiping", "It's so that there's documentation in case a protected class is discriminated against. Not so much for diversity.\n\nThe sexuality stuff isn't asking about your sexual preferences, but documenting that you're a member of a protected group in case your workplace decides to discriminate or become hostile to you because of your sexuality.\n\nI also want to point out being gay isn't the same as having a fetish, at all. If a male coworker wants to bring up that their husband brought them lunch, that would be an example of them disclosing that they are gay without talking about the bedroom. If a workplace decided to antagonize this coworker for bringing up his husband or stop only him from bringing his husband to workplace events where spouses are invited, that would be a case of discrimination. It's not the same as saying, \"I like BDSM,\" on an application.\n\nAs for disabilities, along with being another protected class, disabilities require reasonable accommodation. By knowing what kind of disability you have there can be adjustments made to the workplace. A coworker with a wheelchair will need different accommodations than someone with autism. And they need to be *reasonable* accommodations. Someone with ADHD can't show up late to work everyday or be exempt from meeting deadlines, for example.\n\nThe categories for disabilities aren't made by the businesses, depression *is* a disability. That's the classification for it. Business have to comply with what medical specialists classify as disabilities. That doesn't mean they get special treatment. Maybe the coworker with depression just needs a certain day off to meet with their psychiatrist every 3 months. That's about it. It's really not that deep.", "yeah, I have talked to my mom and she has just showered me with apologies. She told me she had assumed That I had already told Lily because i have been working for her for almost 2 years now. I am not mad at my mom, the post was extremely positive. telling people how proud of her boy she is despite his challenges. It will take a second to forgive her but I will deal with that in therapy lol. She took down all her posts about me without me even asking. My mom is my biggest supporter and I know she was in the wrong and she does too.", "That was my first worry as well.", "I'll admit things may have been updated but as of 2020 nannies (and those working for companies with less than 15 employees) were not covered by Title VII. Some states like NY may have enacted Domestic Workers Bill of Rights which will hopefully make it so nanny employers have to abide by anti-discrimination laws but not many have this so far.\n\n\"Title VII only applies to employers with \u201cfifteen or more employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding calendar year.\u201d\n\nAs most domestic employers do not meet this criteria, this new discrimination ban will not protect many LGBTQIA nannies, house managers, and other household staff members.\" [nanny.org](https://nanny.org/junes-supreme-court-ruling-and-what-it-means-for-you/)\n\nI haven't nannied for a bit now so I'm not as up to date on individual state laws regarding domestic workers as I used to be and I do think COVID helped make it clear we need more protections, so I'd be very pleased to discover more states are moving forward with more specific protective legislation. But I also wouldn't be surprised to find certain states are actually rolling back protections either in the current political climate.", "She didn\u2019t do anything wrong except insufficiently curate her Facebook page, and not everyone knows how to fine tune privacy settings. OP\u2019s sex and gender are not a secret among family and older friends - everyone who has known him for long knows he used to be considered a girl. It isn\u2019t something shameful, and mother is clearly proud of her son.\n\nShe didn\u2019t realize that this could be a harmful information leak when adding new friends, and it may not have occurred to her that employer was a bigot in the dark. Friends and family will never think trans issues through as thoroughly as trans people themselves, because how can we know all the things you all face daily?\n\nSo yeah, it was a mistake. A mistake with ramifications but still an honest mistake. Now she knows.", "That is absolutely valid! I didn't think from your tone it was malicious by your mom but taking time to forgive her is totally understandable. I am trans and I can see my mom doing the same thing, at least if I get to the point of passing lol", "That\u2019s lovely of your Mom to rectify and own her mistake", "Yeah I hate that bigots have literally made false rape and molestation accusations a thing trans people have to fear for it hurts because SO many of us are survivors of that shit too and we instinctively bristle at the idea that someone could be lying about it but yeah GCs do regularly to try to drum up anti trans lynch mobs \n\n- you only have to look at the examples of trans women who get accused of being creeps for just using the changing room while trans.... \n\nor that trans woman who was live streaming herself at lunch and the restaurant got a bunch of false calls about her being innapropriate with Minors when there's literal livestream evidence that she didn't interact with any Minors and was just sitting at her table eating lunch but because she's trans bigots just assume she's a walking sex crime"]}
