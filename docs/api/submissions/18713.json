Not up to anyone else what you\u2019re comfortable with.", "You posted earlier today about how infuriating it is that she keeps coming over to help out constantly because you\u2019re dealing with a newborn? Should add this there as an edit.", "NTA. Why tf is he so invested in his mom watching you nurse? That's creepy AF.", "NTA. It's your body, you're allowed to feel whatever way you want about it. Frankly, what your husband thinks on this subject is irrelevant.", "Nta. Hubby doesn't get to dictate your comfort levels in exposing any part of your body or engaging in an intimate nurturing moment with your child. His mother's profession is irrelevant. It doesn't matter if she's a nurse,  artist who sculpts nude statues or a nudist. Also it's your home and your sanctuary where you should be the most comfortable. His mother should either not come. Go for a walk while you nurse or maybe visit  elsewhere so you can hide away for privacy. you may feel more comfortable as you get used to nursing. Many women are skittish for the first bit and then a few months down the road it's like hey all I'm pulling out a boob to feed my kid in the stadium bleachers watching soccer and if u don't like it eff off. \nI hope you can overcome the aversion and maybe work something out (like a bigger apartment because 2 adults and a newborn in a studio is ridiculous!)  it sounds like she's trying to help out and you need support but you aren't an A h for feeling uncomfortable", "NTA\n\nWow. This is a no brainer. You are the one who needs to feel comfortable with where you nurse, and who can be present. When DH nurses, he can do so in front of whomever he chooses.", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to make decisions about who you feel comfortable breastfeeding in front of or not. You are not required to give your husband reasons for your decisions on comfort or discomfort.", "NTA\n\nYou decide who's around when you're breastfeeding. I would feel the same as you.", "NTA for not wanting to breastfeed in front of her, but if his mom is over there helping y'all out you're going to need to come to some sort of arrangement.

At some point you'll need to breastfeed outside your home so you need a plan for that. And you can use that plan for when in your MIL's presence. But really, this sounds like a situation when you wish your MIL was over less often. Figure out the reason for your discomfort then communicate to your husband and MIL.", "NTA but your husband is such an a. Don't let him (and mil) drag you down. You do what you are comfortable with!", "It's your prerogative to be uncomfortable breast-feeding in front of anyone. If you're uncomfortable breast-feeding in front of your MIL, so be it. She can go for a walk or whatever when you feed the baby when she's visiting.\n\nI'm not going to call you an asshole for it, but it seems to me that calling your husband's opinion \"completely insane and I don\u2019t even understand how he could think that. In fact I think he\u2019s the asshole for making me feel guilty for not breast-feeding in front of his mom\" is a pretty over-the-top reaction to what he said\u2014or at least, to what you said in your post that he said.

Clearly communicate your boundaries and if they can't respect that, they are the AH.", "NTA. Your body, your choice. How much can there possibly be for her to help with in a studio apartment?

I\u2019m a nurse and I don\u2019t expect everyone to have no boundaries with me.  \n\nYour husband means well but is wrong. You feel the way you feel. Trust and intimacy are not things you produce on demand; they come from having a sense of safety with people.  And safety often comes from having confidence that your needs and boundaries will be genuinely respected.", "Info:  is the issue breastfeeding, or is your MIL's constant visiting something you'd be annoyed with anyway?\n\nYou can feel however you feel about breastfeeding in front of different people. But if the real issue is that she's in your space too often, say that.  Set and maintain your boundaries now, because it gets worse as the kids get older if you let it.", "INFO: \n\nI read your other post too and I'm curious, do you actually WANT her help? You said you are very grateful for it but you never actually said if you asked her to help. Did she just take it upon herself to force this help on you and you feel stuck into accepting it?\n\nYou can breastfeed in front of whomever you want, just as you can refuse to breastfeed in front of whomever. Studio apartments are small for one person, let alone 2 parents, a baby and a mil. You don't have space to breathe!", "I just wonder what you\u2019re going to do when you\u2019re in public and your baby needs to feed? Like in a park or in a restaurant? Because you can\u2019t always find privacy to feed. \n\nBut it is your body so you are not an asshole for that. You have the right to decide who sees you in what way. And yet it doesn\u2019t seem like you MIL has done anything to make you feel uncomfortable so I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH either. And I also don\u2019t think your husband is an AH either- although you may need to explain why your uncomfortable to him because all his reasons are valid (except the more uncomfortable in front of your mum- that\u2019s odd to me too). I\u2019m going NAH\n\nJust consider the public feeding. Baby won\u2019t understand that you\u2019re running around looking for somewhere private to feed them while they\u2019re hungry. Maybe get a large muslin or something to cover you up to give you privacy?", "NTA, but I will say it's a little weird. How do you breastfeed in public?\n\nAnd what about if you go swimming with your family, you can't use the change room at the same time?", "NTA.  You are comfortable nursing in front of people you've known your whole life, VS someone you've known a few years. I didn't like nursing in front of my in laws either.", "NTA. You are allowed to have your feelings. If it makes you uncomfortable, then that is legitimate. Maybe part of your discomfort has to do with how much she is there and helping? For me, I would find it uncomfortable for my MIL to be around a lot \u201chelping\u201d. I\u2019d feel like she was taking over, or being judgmental. And breastfeeding can be an intimate time of bonding with your baby, I\u2019d feel like I wanted it to be private without someone controlling hovering about.", "NTA it\u2019s not weird to breastfeed infront of your mom and sister so idk what he\u2019s talking about - more importantly it\u2019s about what you find comfortable since it\u2019s your breast that\u2019s out so put your foot down for your own sake. Your husband cannot and should not police who you feel comfortable breastfeeding around.", "NTA. You have every right to be comfortable or uncomfortable with anything. If they try to reason - tell them it's irrational and you are still uncomfortable, so don't make me get nervous and affect my breast-feeding. I'd say you can lose your ability to produce milk if you are nervous, so everyone should get off with all related requests.", "NTA do whatever you find comfortable", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to set a boundary.", ">I think that\u2019s completely insane and I don\u2019t even understand how he could think that. In fact I think he\u2019s the asshole for making me feel guilty for not breast-feeding in front of his mom.\n\nI understand you not being comfortable but calling or thinking your husband, father of your kid is insane and asshole for giving his opinion is crossing the line. \n\nWorld Over mothers breastfeed their kid and use some  cloth to cover themselves and the kid. \n\nStill you are free to conduct the way you find yourself comfortable. Period. I'm not debating that.\n\nBut being so rude is unacceptable.\n\nYTA.\n\nEdit: i checked your post history. There also I said and I'm repeating, you and your husband have serious communication issues. Pls get hold before it blows your marriage.", "NTA this very clearly isn't an issue about breastfeeding in front of your MIL and more of a problem that you don't want her over as often. Talk to your husband, set boundaries and stand your ground. You will probably get pushback but try to have a calm reasonable discussion as two partners who are on the same team and want what is best for your baby and each other.  I will say though, you will need to be able to breastfeed in public at some point. Get a shawl or  something like that to feel covered but still be able to feed the baby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
