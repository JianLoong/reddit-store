It sounds like it being pushed on her. She never asked for the help and its more help than she wants. You can be grateful for the help but also want less help.\n\nThe husband and mil are pushing her to accept so much help to allow the husband to study for finals.", "How when she still wants mil around just not every day?", "Op is allowed to figure out breastfeeding comfortably. Covering in the beginning isnt", "There doesn\u2019t have to be a reason why you are not comfortable breastfeeding in front if someone.", "Nah that would be creepy because she's his family remember. /S \n\nHe can have her mother watch while he breastfeeds.", "If she is reasonable, she will understand your need for some times of privacy in your small space. Approach her gently, tell her how much you really do appreciate her, but that sometimes it's just too much (because of the space. Blame it on that)\nAs for hubby, he gets zero vote on your comfort level with anything.", "It's 2023, women just breast feed everywhere now... covers are very 1990's.", "Okay. Her husband still gets to have an opinion about it. Just like me thinking it's a little silly. If I think it's silly I'm certainly not going to call someone else an AH for having an opinion.", "A lot people still use them for they aren\u2019t comfortable breastfeeding in front of everyone.", "Not on what she should be comfortable doing in front of others.", "Sure, why not? People get to have opinions on literally anything. Like I said, I have an opinion and I'm not even involved. You're free to think I'm an AH too, but that certainly doesn't change my mind.", "Its one thing to have one and speak it. She literally ask for opinion on this situation. She asked for his on this topic", "NTA. She needs to go home. Really. GO HOME NOW. He can study without her there, she can bond with the baby without her there, they can be together without her there. Cut the apron strings boy.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t get to tell you who you should be comfortable breastfeeding in front of. You decide that.", ">\tand it\u2019s more weird for me to nurse in front of my family.\n\nYour husband sees breastfeeding as sexual. NTA.", "NTA thanks for being considerate of others. I always disliked these women who breastfeed in public.", "NTA. I\u2019m currently breastfeeding. About 9months in so  fairly well established and at the point where I\u2019ll just whip a titty out anywhere. There\u2019s still times when I get uncomfortable and prefer to go someplace with just me and baby. You need to do what\u2019s most comfortable for you, your at your most vulnerable right now and really need a partner who will help and support you. I\u2019m sorry he isn\u2019t supporting you and enforcing boundaries with his mom. I know I would t have been comfortable with someone being over all the time like that, especially if it wasn\u2019t my mom. Maybe that isn\u2019t fair, but we are the ones recovering. \n\nAlso I\u2019d keep an eye on your supply, I\u2019ve noticed when I\u2019m stressed I do t produce as much milk which of course only leads to more stress. It usually takes me a bit to recover and having to be super regular with pumping and nursing again to get back to where I want it to be.", "NTA. It makes you feel uncomfortable, end of story. There is nothing wrong with that and shame on your husband for trying to shame you into doing something that makes you uncomfortable", "Your husband doesn't get to decide how you should feel. NTA", "NTA- change the locks. You deserve to be comfortable in your own home.", "NTA. Maybe look into hanging up a privacy curtain for when MIL is over? Either way, it\u2019s your body and your baby and you deserve to feel comfortable, especially in your own home.", "Be an adult and use your words. I'm sure MIL would understand considering she has seen a lot as a nurse", "Your husband really should be the one communicating with his mom. Sadly, he seems to have his head up his bum. \n\nIf you want to continue receiving her help and preserving this relationship (outside of your husband, since he is not helping the situation) - communicate with her. Eventually, your internal feelings will seep out in other ways, and you don't want to end up blowing up on someone who has genuinely good and kind intentions - and is providing you with support that you want and need.\n\nSimply tell her that you appreciate her kindness, but just need a bit of time to decompress and rest **alone** with you and your baby. Let her know how she can support you, she in turn can tell you what help she can accomodate and is comfortable with, and you two can hopefully come to a happy solution. When you are polite but direct, you can create boundaries without any need for hurt feelings.", "> private matter if the mother wants it to be.  Woman\u2019s breasts were designed to nurse babies just like every mammal.  If someone is comfortable breastfeeding in public they should be able to do that and not have to hide.  I wouldn\u2019t want to eat in a public bathroom, for example, and I don\u2019t think a baby should have to unles\n\nI agree", "1)  the issue is that he thinks one situation is less problematic than the other. He does get to have an opinion on that. He doesn't get to tell her what to do. Which he's not doing. \n\n2) She doesn't have to expose her breast to breastfeed. That's breastfeeding 101.", "I think you're missing some words because that runs counter to what you said previously. \n\nAssuming I'm right about that, I just disagree. He isn't forcing her to do anything. He gets to voice his opinion. She gets to make the decision. There's nothing else to it. He doesn't even think she's an asshole, which for some reason is what the bot says, she thinks he is an asshole for having any opinion at all, which is clearly incorrect to me. Her entire argument here is predicated on her thinking he is trying to guilt trip her, but nothing about the scenario as explained warrants that assessment.", "NTA.\n\nAre you the same person is who is feeling suffocated by the MIL being over all the time? Because if so, your husband needs to start supporting you and not his mommy.", "NTA. How and where you breastfeed is entirely your business. You get to decide. Period. The only thing I can think of is you grew up with your mother and sister and may feel more comfortable doing this very intimate function in their presence. Your MIL, however, is a stranger to whom you are connected only by marriage.\n\nWhatever the reason, it's not a decision open to committee. You do exactly as you please.", "Uhh it's YOUR body and the fact your husband is trying to tell you how to use it and how to feel comfortable in YOUR OWN SKIN is pretty repulsive.", "OP, your MIL genuinely wants to support you. Just talk to her already", "Ask him how he would feel having your family see his privates. I\u2019m very modest also so I understand how you feel. Your husband is way out of line.", "OP has confirmed this in a comment. She is grateful for the help, but she would prefer to be able to ask for help when she needed it, instead of MIL coming and going as she pleases.", "Unless their relationship is reeeeeaaaaalllyyyyyyy good, this is a bad idea. It's OP's husband the one who should deal with his mom.", "Actually, I agree that it's a private matter in the aspect that no one else gets to interfere with it, or ask the nursing mother to do it elsewhere or differently.\n\nJust like a kiss between two lovers is a private moment even if it happens in public, so is breastfeeding - private between mother and child, even if it happens at the food court or the library.", ">He does get to have an opinion on that. He doesn't get to tell her what to do. Which he's not doing.\n\nThe issue is, he thinks his opinion is more valid than OP's and for that reason he does not transmit OP's discomfort to his mother. He is not telling her what to do, he is impeding her to do things as she wants.", "The problem is, since he disagrees with her, he won't talk to his mom to transmit OP's discomfort. Therefore, he is interfering with her wish for a little more privacy."]}
