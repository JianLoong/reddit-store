My sister lost all her hearing at the age of 3. My parents are not fluent in American Sign Language (ASL), so they only use \"home-signs\" (made-up signs including pointing). I am the youngest of 7, and the one who knows the most ASL. Because of this, I have been interpreting/translating for my sister to my parents, sometimes older sibilings, etc. Growing up, I'd always get irritated when my parents/sibilings would make me interpret. I've increasingly gotten more irritated with them over the years (not my deaf sister; it's not her fault). My older sibilings have made a small effort into learning more ASL. My parents on the other hand, have not. Yesterday, my deaf sister vented to me after struggling to understand what our mom was trying to tell her. This wasn't the first time, but for some reason it made me angry (unlike the other times where I was just frustrated). I approached my mom and told her what my sister had said. My mom replied that she can't remember signs because of her age (she's 50). I told her that she had 23 years to learn ASL, but didn't make an effort to. My mom then said that it wasn't her fault because there are not many resources to learn ASL for Spanish speakers (my parents know very little English). I brought up how I've translated (in written format) English videos teaching ASL to Spanish, but she never utilized my papers. I then told her that she can't even sign \"what's your favorite color\" and that she was never there for my sister when traumatic things were happening. This is when she started to cry and ask why I was blaming her. I did not comfort her. I just left to my room. I love my parents and my deaf sister does too, but it can get hard sometimes. We have our good days and bad days. And I am honestly tired. I think that is why I snapped. After the argument, I felt bad. My parents are immigrants. They never finished Elementary school. Maybe that is why they couldn't learn ASL. I've never gotten into a big argument like that with my mom and have not apologized.", "created_utc": 1697349405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1788u9n/aita_for_making_my_mom_cry/", "score": 258, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

ASL, which I have just learned, isn't a one for one translation into english.  The sign for blue means blue in spanish as well.  \n\nYour mom is 50, she's not 206.  She's at a vibrant age and that's just an excuse.", "NTA \n\nYou're a wonderful person and the only compassionate person in your family. I cannot imagine giving birth to a deaf child and not learning ASL. Your parents had the opportunity to learn alongside your sister since she was born. 23 years of them consciously choosing to not be able to communicate with their own child is asshole behavior. \n\nAs you know, learning ASL is not that hard. They don't even want to learn how to communicate in the language of the country they live in. I'm born in the US 6 years older than your mother and I learned ASL and French even though I have nobody to talk to in those languages. You don't need a college level education to learn languages. My mother is an immigrant with the equivalent of a 6th grade education, too. She worked her way up in a job to become a department manager. Your mother is full of invalid excuses and is using tears to manipulate you. \n\nI'm glad your sister has you.", "[deleted]", "I've read the first few sentences and know all I need to. \n\nYou're NTA. You're parents especially are and your siblings kinda are. I get sometimes siblings don't have time to learn with their own bullshit. \n\nParents better damn well learn how to communicate with their own kid instead of treating them like a fuckkng ape and pointing at shit. Are you kidding me with that?", "NTA\n\nYou are an amazing person and your sister is so lucky to have you in her life. There is no excuse your parents can give that make it right.\n\nYour sister grew up without the adults in her life being able to meaningfully communicate with her. That is on them and I can only imagine how hurtful it is for her that her parents were not invested enough to learn to have a conversation with her.", "Sounds like mom never even tried to learn.", "People can try and fail and it can really get to them and hold them back. I\u2019m not defending the mother, she had 23 years to put in some effort and 50 isn\u2019t even that old, it\u2019s rather appalling. \n\nBut when everything is out and feelings are raw, in these situations it is the best time to learn.", "Ah. The old, crying-when-it's-clear-you-have-no-leg-to-stand-on, maniplulation tactic.", "NTA.  I am just flabbergasted that your parents have never learned to sign.  How can a parent not make the effort to learn to communicate with their child.  They should have started learning the day they found out your sister was deaf. I don't know where you are located but there are almost certainly agencies for the deaf which could have assisted your parents.  If they were motivated, they could have learned simple signs from you and built up their skills slowly over the years.  If you are located in an English-speaking country, such as the USA, then it sounds like they could not be bothered to learn English either.  50 is not too old to learn a new language.  I'm 66 and I am currently learning both Dutch and Auslan (Australian Sign Language).", "So your parents live in an mainly English speaking country and never made the effort to learn the language. Not even to learn ASL to have a wsy to properly communicate with their own dsughter? How is that not their fault?", "NTA. Was she 50 23 years ago too?", "Nta.\n\nThey've had decades to learn how to communicate with their child and sibling. It's really sad they've barely tried. It probably makes your sister feel horrible.", "NTA, a parent not being able to communicate with their own child is awful. \n\nBut \u201cnever finished Elementary school\u201d plus not ever using your papers makes me wonder whether your parents maybe struggle with reading? Maybe you could carefully ask them about that (many adults in that situation are embarrassed by it). If so, there are courses for adults in that situation. Maybe you could help them sign up for one.", "NTA they don't care enough and are making excuses", "NTA. Yes, sign is tricky to learn and takes time, especially if your parents don\u2019t read or speak good English but honestly that\u2019s a bullshit excuse. Their daughter went deaf at 3, that\u2019s 23 years to learn a bit more than pointing and some made up home signs. They\u2019ve done the bare minimum to communicate with their own daughter, that\u2019s really terrible parenting and not related to their nationality or culture. They have chosen to not even try to learn or find a way to learn some ASL. There are free beginner courses online, in person classes, flash cards, games so that families can learn together, grants for helping families of a deaf child to access ASL, there are resources out there. Your parents chose not to utilise them.\n\n\nYour mum isn\u2019t crying because of you. She\u2019s crying because she knows you are right, you pointed out how she has failed your sister by not making an effort to be there for her. Your mum is an asshole, so is your dad. Your sister is being very kind by only complaining this once after they have isolated her in her own family and made no effort to understand her or her Deaf identity or her culture. Not even learning basic finger spelling is rude and lazy. \n\n\nAs a hearing person who works with Deaf people, thank you for making the effort to learn Sign. It\u2019s not easy, especially the grammar is different to spoken English, and it can be hard to find the right class/ teacher. I\u2019m glad there is at least one person in the house who makes the effort to speak her language and advocate for her.", "What loving mother wouldn't do everything in her power to make sure she was able to communicate with her own child? NTA. Your mom deserves to feel bad for neglecting your elder sister and parentifying you.", "NTA she\u2019s older, what would they do before you came along? It\u2019s quite an age gap, to not be able to communicate with anyone else in her home during the formative years sounds rough", "They managed to move across national frontiers, have several kids, have lived and careers in a new society, and all the rest.   And they apparently can't learn the basics of sign language in over 20 years because \"they are immigrants\"?  OP's mom's problem is not her immigrant status.  It's because she didn't think communicating with her daughter was worth her time.", "So your solution is to put even more pressure and responsibility on OP to facilitate communication between her mother and her sister because mom is too lazy and selfish to learn basic signs after 23! years?? If mom was truly sorrowful, she would have figured it out years ago.", "NTA\nMy daughters grandmother went  to college and got her PhD after she turned so I can only really call your mother lazy. 100% it will be a little more difficult without more formal education but in over two decades your parents would be fluent. You shouldn't have been used as a translator all these years, your parents have put you and your sister in a terrible position here.", ">she can't remember signs because of her age (she's 50)\n\nLame excuse is lame.  NTA.\n\nI know a couple who learned ASL after they retired because their son and daughter-in-law adopted a deaf girl.   He's in his 80s, she's in her 70s.", "You don't have to know English to learn ASL.", "Maybe ask your parents how they intend to communicate with your sister when she moves on her own? Are they expecting to only see her when you\u2019re around? Sounds like she\u2019ll be going low contact shortly after she gets out of that house with your parents\u2026", "NTA\n\nYou seem wonderful person and I do hope Your parents will use Your resources to learn the language one day.", "NTA... they absolutely have the ability to learn ASL. They need to stop being  lazy and get it done. \nYou need to tell your parents that you expect them to change. Help them find the resources and use sign language to talk to them", "NTA. You are a fantastic person and you and your sister are lucky to have each other.  I completely agree with the earlier commenters.\n\nI truly feel for your sister, I imagine she's felt \"warehoused\" all of her life, not like a true and valued member of the family. What a lonely way to live. \n\nAgain, you're a bright spot in her lonely world. I hope she can find opportunities to move out and live independently - at a distance she chooses from her bio-parents.", "NTA. Imagine having a kid, then doing nothing to learn how to communicate with them. I wonder how OP's sister feels about her whole family not caring enough to learn ASL, to talk to her. Honestly it's sad. And the Mom needed to her it, heck the whole family should be ashamed. That sister is alienated by her whole family, simply cause she can't directly communicate with them.", "Nta. Your mother didnt learn because you were there to translate for her and also because she didnt think it was important enough.", "NTA\n\nWhy...would you comfort her? You're talking to her about how she's in the wrong here, as a mother and family to your sister and you, because she's not making the effort. She blames it on her age, not her lack of education, and you've provided her with resources, but she hasn't used those either. Than, after calling this out, she bursts into tears when she's the one in the wrong, so you think you're supposed to drop the anger, drop the rightful disdain, and tell her it's all ok? That people aren't reaaaaally made at her?\n\nI won't say her crying is some kind of manipulative defense mechanism, but there's a reason people see it as that. A lot of, \"consoling\" when someone begins to cry in the hot seat comes with a lot of softening or full retraction of what was said, even if it needed to be said. Plus, it's additional emotional labour you would have been forced to undergo when your criticism is the amount of emotional labour you've already had to go through, because they don't want to actually communicate with their eldest daughter.", "Nta. Your parents and your other siblings are just horrible. ASL is the only way your sister has to communicate.", "So your sister was 3 when she was diagnosed, but you're also the younger sister so either a literal baby or not born yet when she was diagnosed. So how exactly were they communicating with her before you learned ADL yourself?\n\nNTA at all. She's their daughter they should be making a concious effort to learn. Also sign language exists in other languages. So if American sign language was too hard for them to learn since its already their second language, maybe they could have learned spanish sign language and your sister could have been taught dually growing up.", "23 years after she lost her hearing and your parents haven't bothered to learn ASL? I wouldn't feel bad. It's not all your responsibility to communicate. NTA.", "NTA its just the truth and it hurts. \n\nIf any people I knew refused to learn how to communicate with their kids I would be cutting them out. Its one of the more evil parenting things I can think of that isn\u2019t straight abuse. Like come on. If you can move countries you can learn sign language.", "NTA", "NTA - I speak BSL and I\u2019ve got to say due to the grammar surrounding sentence structure etc - someone who didn\u2019t speak fantastic English might have a better time learning sign. If they put the effort into it they could have had a fantastic real with their child and not be reliant on you to speak to her.", "NTA. There is a free app called Pocket Sign where you can type in a word/phrase and a video pops up of someone using ASL. Is she \"can't remember\" she can get the app. It's extremely unfair that her parents didn't bother to learn ASL to communicate with their child.", "Nta. They've had years to learn and pretty sure your not the only one with Spanish parents and a deaf child", "NTA. If you translating was a temporary stop-gap while your parents tried to learn, I would totally understand. But that\u2019s not what happened. I cannot imagine how frustrating and alienating this must be for your sister. It\u2019s clear communicating with their deaf daughter is not a priority.", "70% of hearing parents to deaf children never learn sign. It's atrocious.", "I was with my niece and her almost two year old daughter last week and saw that they were adding a wee bit of ASL in their communication. Niece said that they were learning it from Miss Rachel! (The kid\u2019s show.) That\u2019s impressive! \u2b50\ufe0f", "Seriously? It's very sad..."]}
