I said I would like a nice meal at a fancy restaurant. She said, no, that\u2019s too expensive. I kept giving options to what I would like, an overnight stay at any hotel with a pool, an out of town overnight/day trip, meal at a fancy AYCE restaurant, or a cheap airbnb with pool access. She declined all of those because it was too expensive, too far, etc. \n\nShe countered with treating the whole extended family (20 pax) to a cheap Chinese restaurant the day *after* my birthday because that\u2019s a weekend. Not even the fancy kind. A cheap, almost fast food type of restaurant. She was insistent so I gave in since she\u2019ll be paying because it\u2019s \u201cmy gift\u201d. Mind you, our family is mid-upper middle class and I\u2019m an only child so expenses aren\u2019t a problem.\n\nOn the day of my birthday (today), there\u2019s literally nothing. Not even a breakfast or lunch cooked. No card or flowers. Nothing. Not even a Facebook post. She said that since we\u2019re going out tomorrow, there\u2019s no need to celebrate my birthday today. I lost my temper and started screaming at the top of my lungs that that\u2019s NOT what I wanted to do. I wanted to eat good food in a nice quiet fancy restaurant. Not have a mini reunion at a cheap Chinese restaurant. The price of feeding 20 people costs much more than the price of 2 people at a fancy restaurant too. Now she\u2019s crying and calling me ungrateful.

At that point, what's the point of even asking you. I understand it's her money, but she shouldn't be offering to treat you, then holding it over your head by just doing what she wants for your birthday. Also you are 30, screaming and throwing a fit is not the way to handle situations.", "Info - why don't you organise something with friends? \nYour mother has likely been like this forever, you've set yourself up for heartache relying on her to do something special. \nYou're an adult ... When we grow up, organising birthday parties falls on us.", "YTA. 30 years old and still acting like an entitled child. If you want that expensive meal so badly, buy it for yourself  like an adult.", "I don't think a card and some attention is too much to ask for HOWEVER I do agree with other commenters that are saying you ought to have celebrated yourself - nothing stopping you from booking an overnight hotel stay or getting together with some friends and going to a nicer restaurant IN ADDITION TO your mom's gift. \n\nINFO: did you want all the people there at the meal or was that mom's choice? Is the number of people what stopped the expensive things being possible?", "also an Asian, so i have to ask this:\n\nwhy are you depending this much on your family when you're literally 30? couldn't you just go out by your own and host whatever event you want?", "YTA You're 30 year old, you are too old to throw a tantrums like a three year old because your mommy couldn't afford to rent a hotel room with a pool.\n\n>I lost my temper and started screaming at the top of my lungs that that\u2019s NOT what I wanted to do. I wanted to eat good food in a nice quiet fancy restaurant. Not have a mini reunion at a cheap Chinese restaurant.\n\nDid you stamp your feet too?. If you want to go out to an expensive restaurant, make reservations and treat yourself. If you want to go way to a hotel with a pool, no one is stopping you. You may be 30 but your are far from grown up.", "Going against the grain here but I'd say NTA: why ask someone what they'd like to do or want for they birthday only to dismiss all of their wishes without even trying to look into something similar that would be closer or within your budget? Your mom is in the wrong for asking then acting like it's nothing, and you are not the AH for wanting something and telling her that when asked. Why ask if she never needed and answer?\n\nHowever, you are not entirely right here as well. You knew she wouldn't do anything you suggested, so why did you agree to something you wouldn't enjoy? Only because it's free? At 30 you should know better and either plan your own party on your own terms or decline something you'd hate altogether rather then go through with it and be unhappy. You said it's not what you wanted to do, well, didn't you realize that in advance? You kinda did it to yourself by agreeing to follow her plan.", "YTA.\n\nYou're THIRTY. Grow up.\n\nYour parents don't owe an adult child a birthday party.", "This gave me second hand embarrassment lol. You are 30. Grow. Up.

She\u2019s made your birthday about her. Take yourself out for a nice dinner.", "INFO: why can\u2019t you organise and pay for your own birthday celebration?", "NTA. Going against the tide to say it was odd that she kept asking you and then only offered you what she obviously already wanted to do. That is frustrating. \n\nAnd if you live together, it would be disappointing to not even have the day acknowledged. \n\nMight have reacted a bit strongly but it\u2019s understandable. Especially on a milestone birthday.", "NTA I read your comment where you said you were willing to pay to do the expensive things with your mom she just refused to do them I think you truly just wanted to spend time with your mom and she didn\u2019t realize that and it hurt you .", "ESH. Her idea of a celebration sounds horrible. Your screaming fit was childish and not the way a reasonable adult behaves.", "YTA.\n\nThe entitlement! You \\_screamed \\_at your Mom after she told you, for weeks in advance, that all your options were too expensive? And, God forbid, she didn't \\_cook\\_ for you?\n\nIsn't it time you clipped your umbilical cord from Mommy and moved out?", "I kinda get where you're coming from. I mean , there's literally one day a year that's about you and only you: your birthday. Also, 30 being a round one in kind of a milestone too. \n\nStill, screaming with your mom over it, still is a bit too harsh. If I were you, I'd just simply refuse to go at all, telling her that's not how I want to celebrate my bday. Probably would invite my friends to a restaurant of my own choice instead. \n\nESH", "bait", "YTA. Grow up. I\u2019m turning 30 soon and every line of your post is cringe and sounds something a teenager would say/do", "Some ppl are brutal. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask to feel appreciated and celebrated on your birthday. It\u2019s one day! As someone who\u2019s family don\u2019t make any effort (esp on a big milestone like 30), it\u2019s not a nice feeling. Doesn\u2019t cost much to get a cheap cake and a pack of $3 balloons. It\u2019s the effort. If money was an issue I can understand her not wanting to go to a fancy place but paying for a group of ppl for a Chinese restaurant adds up so doesn\u2019t sound like money is an issue. Sounds more like she wanted to do what she wanted for your birthday. NTA and id be upset. I was for my 21st and after that stopped making the effect for everybody else.", "NTA\n\nShe made a family reunion instead of a birthday, she did what she wanted, not you.", "NTA\n\nYour age has nothing to do with it. \n\nShe didn't listen to what you wanted and chose to do something for herself with the guise of it being a bday present. \n\nDo exactly the same for her bday and when she says something cry and call her ungrateful.", "NTA - Your behavior was not very mature, but I get the frustration.", "NTA. \n\nI don't understand all the YTA. People act like just because you are an adult, you are not allowed to have fun or be disappointed about birthdays when they don't go your way. \n\n30 years is a milestone, and your mom shouldn't have asked what you wanted just to turn all your ideas down. She should have just planned or bought you a gift \"if money was an issue.\" If someone asked me what I wanted, I tell them, and then they proceed to turn down my every idea as well... I would be frustrated, too!\n\nI would fck that dinner, tell your mom just to give you money, and go treat yourself & just pay the difference, at a fancy restaurant you like. Ask a friend to join you because your mom is ridiculous.", "NTA. I know where that kind of outburst comes from. She's probably been ignoring your wishes your whole life, and it gets exhausting. I hope you're in a position to consider moving out and getting your own space to breathe.", "NTA that\u2019s not what you wanted and she still pushed it \n\nAnd then not even acknowledging your birthday\n\nEveryone who said you are entitled, doesn\u2019t know what love means", "YTA\n\nYou're 30, time to grow up.\nNext time, be the adult you are and book and pay for things yourself to avoid disappointment and ridiculous tantrums.", "YTA you are 30! Stop acting like an entitled child. You can treat yourself to all of that if you want. You know, like an adult. Sure it sucks to first ask what you want and then just go the own way and not at least congratulate but again, you are 30 and not a kid.", "YTA 30 but still acting like a child.", "Yta. You're old enough to do whatever you want to do for your birthday so .... Go do it. Don't expect it to be funded by your mother. & she told you No to all ideas you gave her and you were mad there was nothing for you the day of. \n\nFor fuck sake. I'm younger than you. Both my parents are dead . Grow the fuck up", "OMFG, YTA, such a huge one.  You are 30 years old.  Grow up. Get yourself moved out of your parents home.  They do not need your mature BS in their line of vision every day.", "YTA.  You\u2019re a 30 year old adult.  You want something for your birthday, you do it.  \nIt\u2019s shitty of her to ask and still not do anything, but she doesn\u2019t have to.  I bet this behavior isn\u2019t new.", "YTA because you did know this was the plan and you did agree to it. She told you your options were too expensive but you kept suggesting expensive things. You should have put your foot down and paid yourself if you wanted one of your suggestions. You\u2019re 30 so there\u2019s nothing stopping you from paying for your birthday celebration and organising it how you want it (unless this is culturally inappropriate for you?). It\u2019s also her money so she gets to choose how much she wants to spend and how to spend it. If she thinks a fancy dinner is too expensive for her to pay for with HER money, then that\u2019s up to her. I do agree paying for 20 people at a low cost restaurant can be more expensive than paying for 2 people at a high end restaurant. Did you ask her what her reasoning for this was? Is it because she wanted to celebrate with the entire family rather than just you two? Is it common practice in your culture to celebrate with more family or larger gatherings? Does she feel it\u2019s more worth the price because she\u2019s feeding more mouths? Did you want it to be a celebration between the two of you? Overall it is pretty entitled to expect people to pay for expensive things for your birthday.", "NTA, but you really should control your temper. do you work a job? simply do it all yourself with your own money and invite others to your celebration....", "YTA, you need to concentrate on growing up and acting your age more than being ugly to your mom on your adult birthday.", "You\u2019re 30 darling. You can do whatever you want for your birthday! That\u2019s the only upside of being an adult.", "YTA.  You are thirty.  At this age, if you want to do something fancy for your birthday, you get it for yourself and invite your friends out with you.", "ESA, but I still feel for you that this day isn\u2019t more special. Happy birthday \ud83c\udf82 , but check your temper.", "ESH. I also had a mom that asked what I wanted to do for special occasions or meals, then just did whatever she wanted\u2026often the complete opposite of what I asked for. It was a passive-aggressive thing. So I get that frustration of \u201cthen why did you ask?\u201d But come on, you\u2019re 30 and it\u2019s time not to rely on mom for your fancy-restaurant birthday dinner. Do that with a friend instead.", "You are thirty not three. Let go of the birthday thing. A little maturity is way over due. Your Mom is insensitive but I think you already knew that. At thirty, you plan a celebration with your friends not your parents.", "YTA- this is very sad. Time to make yourself happy. Put on your grown-up pants and celebrate this year by finding out how to take care of your own emotional needs.", "YTA you sound entitled, lazy and like a absolut brat. You are 30! Time to plan your own partys and invite the people you want to have with you! Your mother invited all family to be with you, just a day later. Whats more important? Being with your family or a fancy meal?", "YTA. \n\nYou sound like a 5 year old.", "YTA - Jesus. I turned 30 last month and can't imagine acting how you did. 'I lost my temper and started screaming at the top of my lungs that that\u2019s NOT what I wanted to do.' - I haven't done this since I was about 4-5 years old. I wanted a break away with a hot tub for my birthday, do you know what I did? I booked and paid for it.  If you want a fancy dinner or a night in a hotel, bloody pay for it yourself.", "YTA. You\u2019re 30. Grow up. Get some friends and plan and pay for your own celebration if you don\u2019t like what she has planned.", "Screaming? At the top of your lungs? Are you like five years old? YTA!", "YTA.\n\nI somehow missed your age and thought this was written by a teenager and I felt sympathetic. However, after reading some comments I find out that you're 30. You are definitely the asshole. Grow up.", "YTA. There is a typo in your post; you accidentally typed 30 instead of 3. \n\nYour mother should have given more guidelines in advance. Like, what do you want to do with 20 people. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t change the fact that you act like an entitled toddler.", "YTA, I'm 25 and at this point I'm over the moon about socks, to throw a tantrum... Its harsh but get a grip you're 30. Guessing your parents might be slightly to blame here, but not for the Chinese food, for raising someone so entitled. Jesus if i raged at my mother about anything at my big old age id be very embarrassed, not asking if i was an asshole on the internet", "YTA\n\nYou're so much the A I can see it from across the globe. Get a grip and apologize to your mother for your outrageous fit. Your family is upper middle class, yet they've raised a person without any.", "YTA, are you sure you didn't turn 13?", "I\u2019m between ESH and YTA\u2026why has your mum been asking you what you want/want to do just to simply decline everything? And not even a card on the day of your birthday is pretty sucky. However, your temper tantrum makes you the AH here. If you want a fancy meal, take yourself out for one.", "Oh you are AH.   Ok some recognition on the day would have been nice and that's hurtful.  \n\nOtherwise you are 30 not 3.  Tantrums are not good at that age.  You've got a whole family celebrating with you.  You want expensive and flashy. Seems like she and your family wanted you. For some reason.", "You are 30 NOT 3! What is wrong with you? YTA for yelling at her and she\u2019s also TA for doing 20 people family get together at cheap place. She asked and you told her. She decided on something else. YOU COULD HAVE SAID NO THANKS MOM\u2026 not made her cry.", "YTA. And, in case it wasn't already obvious, your mom is trying to piss you off to the point that you move out.", "People are starving and in wars.", "YTA. There's no reason to treat your mother that way. I'd bet you have acted this way towards your mother like this before. Perhaps that's why you're not getting what you ask for.", "YTA.  \n\n\nYou behaved like a toddler having a meltdown tantrum.  Is your family cheap?  And have they always been cheap?  Yeah, there are people out there like that.  But if you want something and the answer is \"no\" then the solution is not to throw a tantrum.    \n\n\nIf you wanted any of those nice things, you should do them for yourself.  Surely, if you live at home and have few to no expenses you can afford them yourself?    \n\n\nYou're way too old, at 30, to be acting like this.", "Yeah ESH\u2026 she shouldn\u2019t ask if she has her own agenda. BUT Op you are 30 yrs old! Stop acting like a spoiled teenager and do what you want to do. You\u2019re beyond an adult now, act like it.", "YTA and are coming across as massively entitled. Screaming at 30 because your birthday wasn't what you wanted? Please.", "ESH, and that's after taking into account your comment where you said that you offered to pay for it as that changes a lot and you really should mention that in the main post. Otherwise I'd have likely gone with YTA.\n\nOverall it looks to me like she wants the dinner to be with a lot of family since it's your 30th birthday, thus the fancy restaurant is way too expensive. Meanwhile it looks like you just want a 2 person dinner at a fancy restaurant. Thus it's not just the type of restaurant that you two are disagreeing on, but the very scope of the dinner party.\n\nBut in reality there's not necessarily a conflict there at all, after all your mother wants the dinner to be the day after your birthday, so you could still have held that 2 person dinner with her on your actual birthday, or as a lunch on the same day as the dinner, etc. Depending on timezones you might still be able to do this even now..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYet instead of working things out she forces the party she wants on you and you lose your temper and scream at her. Of course she was acting quite shitty too by asking you what you want, then shooting everything down and driving her own will through. Who's birthday is this exactly, hers or yours? Not even doing something small like a cake/card/flower on the actual day is also disappointing, we generally still did that even if the actual celebration was on a later day.\n\nStill, I'd have to say she's right in calling you ungrateful (though entitled would have been the word I'd use) and losing your temper and screaming is not the way to go about it, but she also handled things so badly that I can only conclude this with ESH.", "ESH\n\nYou, for demanding a specific gift an throwing a tantrum over it. Her, for giving a \"gift\" that she knows isn't wanted.\n\nJust accept that you're a grown-ass adult and that your mum isn't into giving birthday presents to adult children.", "Wow. You\u2019re 30. Take yourself out for a fancy meal at a nice restaurant. \n\nI can\u2019t believe you were asking your mom to do all this expensive stuff for you. You\u2019re grownup. You can pay for a trip or hotel or whatever. Why cry to your mom for it?", "People saying Y T A are focusing too much on the fact that op is 30 and living at home. Every culture is different. Chill out. This post is more about how OPs wish for their birthday was ignored and instead the mom did what *she* wanted. OP has a right to be frustrated.\n\nThis situation is the same as the post a couple days back when the wife told the husband she wanted steak and rice and he ordered shrimp and vegetables. And then bought sushi and she screamed at him.\n\nSo yeah, NTA. Imagine someone asks what you want for Christmas, you tell them, give them a list and they buy something that is completely useless to you", "ESH but happy birthday anyway.", "NTA Simply because you offered to pay but she was inssiting to pay herself (but wouldn't let you choose what you wanted).\n\nBtw OP stated this info in comments", "NTA. Your mom started an entire conversation about doing something for your birthday, refused to do anything you actually wanted, didn't bother to do anything birthday related despite living together and voluntold you your birthday was going to be a makeshift family reunion at a cheap restaurant that you didn't even want to go to later in the week. \n\nAnd yeah, I call BS on a 20 person party somehow costing less than a single night at a hotel or a dinner for two.

It became clear very early that she wasn't willing to spend that level of money on you. You could have asked for something at a more reasonable rate.

In fact, you might have just screwed yourself out of going. \n\nAnd regarding the price of feeding 20 people vs. taking 2 people to a nicer restaurant?

I said I would like a nice meal at a fancy restaurant. She said, no, that\u2019s too expensive. I kept giving options to what I would like, an overnight stay at any hotel with a pool, an out of town overnight/day trip, meal at a fancy AYCE restaurant, or a cheap airbnb with pool access. She declined all of those because it was too expensive, too far, etc. \n\nShe countered with treating the whole extended family (20 pax) to a cheap Chinese restaurant the day *after* my birthday because that\u2019s a weekend. Not even the fancy kind. A cheap, almost fast food type of restaurant. She was insistent so I gave in since she\u2019ll be paying because it\u2019s \u201cmy gift\u201d. Mind you, our family is mid-upper middle class and I\u2019m an only child so expenses aren\u2019t a problem.\n\nOn the day of my birthday (today), there\u2019s literally nothing. Not even a breakfast or lunch cooked. No card or flowers. Nothing. Not even a Facebook post. She said that since we\u2019re going out tomorrow, there\u2019s no need to celebrate my birthday today. I lost my temper and started screaming at the top of my lungs that that\u2019s NOT what I wanted to do. I wanted to eat good food in a nice quiet fancy restaurant. Not have a mini reunion at a cheap Chinese restaurant. The price of feeding 20 people costs much more than the price of 2 people at a fancy restaurant too. Now she\u2019s crying and calling me ungrateful. AITA? \n*we\u2019re Asians, living in Asia (for cultural context)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's not that easy. Idk what country OP is from. \"Like an adult\" here is really defined by the context that suits parents.me and my older sis got used to my birthday not being about me but about family reunions for most of my childhood. It wasn't a problem because we just didn't know and never complained even if we were uncomfortable.\nMy sis lashed out at 27 years old when my mom did something that she liked to do for my sister on her birthday. \nThat was the first time. But she got labelled the rude harsh and rebel \"kid\". 27 is not a kid. But my mother, aunt, uncle and everyone were trying to discipline her because it was not right.\n\nWith my experience, OP was not entitled. OP was frustrated. Maybe we don't share the same history, but it's very obvious that the mother wanted a family event and just used OP's birthday. It becomes very clear especially on the actual Birthday. \nComplaining about a birthday at 30 at mom's home?

Asia is a HUGE continent and there are stark differences between being Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean etc... (to name a few). The same applies if someone says they are European too (Russia and Spain are both in Europe but vastly different). This is why I don't think people on Reddit should be identifying themselves by their continent but rather their nationality. You may find one person who is Asian may come from say, Pakistan or Bangladesh and for them it's normal to be late to places, but for people in Japan, punctuality is absolutely culturally expected and is key, so if there was an AITA post asking if someone being late made them an AH, and they say they are Asian... the responses would differ significantly.\n\nThat being said, OP's issue isn't cultural. OP is a 30 year old adult and if OP wants the birthday of their dreams, then OP is old enough to enjoy it with friends or by themselves. I do agree, however, that not even wishing OP a happy birthday on their birthday was an AH move from OP's mother. It takes no effort at all to see OP on their birthday, give a hug and say \"happy birthday sweetheart!\".", "Then mom shouldnt ask what she wanted if she really didnt want to know.

She couldn't afford an expensive gift.  That isn't making it about her.\n\nOP's comment that cheap food for 20 is just as expensive as an expensive meal for 2 is stupid because she never said she was paying for everyone.

Therefore when you receive something for free like a gift, just be thankful and move on. You can be disappointed that it wasn\u2019t something you would have preferred more, but again it was a gift. Just treat yourself to what you would have preferred. Stop waiting for others to celebrate you exactly how you want to be celebrated. Appreciate that you have people in your life that want to celebrate you at all, this isn\u2019t a privilege all people have. All people can celebrate themselves though.

No, we just think that it's nice to spend some money to do something nice with your loved ones, especially if that's what THEY want.\n\nOP's mum, on the other hand, only cares about what she wants, to the point of spending more money for a cheap restaurant rather than spending LESS money on what OP actually wanted to do.
