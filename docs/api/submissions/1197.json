She doesnt want to make time for you but she doesn't want her sister to spend time with you either.  Let her make  the move to ask to schedule a time to talk.  I wouldn't make the first move.  If you  want yo continue to talk to the sister then do it. You know she is going to make her get off the phone if it's to long..so be prepared. Don't make fuss just say talk to you next time.  You can't make anyone talk to you if they don't want to.  So, in this case let her make the move and tell her you are busy if she wants to schedule.", "It's draining to be the only person putting any effort into a relationship. I think if you still want contact with her, don't put in extra effort for her when she doesn\u2019t for you. Try putting in the same amount, maybe calling sometimes and also waiting for her to initiate things.", "But I the thing is I am scared of her reaction if I stop and if I call her sister or parents she would like interject and be angry at me", "Ok ya I can try that", "she\u2019s lying to you and making excuses to not speak to you though. am i missing something?", "She is"]}
