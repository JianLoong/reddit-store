This includes my brother\u2019s 11-year-old son Allan, 6-year-old daughter Ava, and my sister\u2019s 10-year-old daughter Kelly.\r  \n\r  \nLast May, we planned a weekend trip with the kids to a beach town about an hour away. We did this to spend time with them and also to confirm if they would be ready for longer overnight trips, and we\u2019d also be within driving distance of home if any of them needed to go home early.\r  \n\r  \nMe and my husband expected that Ava may have had a hard time being away from her parents overnight since she\u2019s still 6. But both she and Allan were well-behaved the whole trip. Kelly however misbehaved for the entirety of the beach trip:\r  \n\r  \nFriday: Pick-up from their parents\u2019 houses around 5 and got to the beach town by 7. During the car ride, Kelly was being an instigator and kept trying to start a fight with Allan. Kelly was not listening at the grocery store and refused to take turns with Allan and Ava with the TV.\r  \n\r  \nSaturday: Kelly threw a fit because she wanted ice cream and we told her that we wouldn\u2019t be going to the ice cream store until later. We told her she could have fruit for a snack if she was hungry and Kelly threw some of the fruit in the trash before my husband stopped her. \r  \n\r  \nAt the beach, Kelly kept re-filling the hole Ava was trying to dig with sand despite being told multiple times to stop. Kelly kept trying to start fights with her cousins. During dinner, Kelly was rude to our waitress and was sarcastic the first time we told her to apologize.\r  \n\r  \nSunday: At the gift store, Kelly wanted to have a conch shell and a mermaid doll but didn\u2019t have enough pocket money to get both. When we told Kelly she would need to pick one and couldn\u2019t have both, she ended up being allowed to have neither because she kept throwing a fit.\r  \n\r  \nAt the hotel, Kelly was not listening and kept trying to watch TV despite being told multiple times to help with packing suitcases. During the car ride home, Kelly was again being an instigator and kept trying to start fights with Allan and Ava.\r  \n\r  \nMe and my husband told my sister that Kelly was not coming on any more overnight trips with us because of her behavior. My sister is angry now because we haven\u2019t changed our minds and are staying true to our word by only bringing Allan and Ava to our week-long trip in August.\r  \n\r  \nMy sister told me that Kelly is just acting like a kid and she\u2019s only 10. I agreed with my sister that, exactly, Kelly is a 10-year-old. There\u2019s a reason we waited until the kids got to their current ages. She\u2019s too old to be constantly misbehaving and throwing fits like a 4-year-old.\r  \n\r  \nShe says Allan and Ava may be mature/calm for their ages but I am out of line to punish Kelly for not being the exception to her age and she hopes me and my husband feel good about ourselves after excluding a child.

You are aunt and uncle of the year, omg. Don't worry about your sister either. She's just upset that you are being a better parent to her child - by sticking to your word - than she is capable of being.", "NTA - her parents have excused her bad behavior to the point a 6 year old acted better then a 10 year old. This is beyond 'being an exception to their age' unless there is a developmental delay not noted in the post? If so, then it may just not be the right time for overnight trips for her.\nYou are not obligated to put up with bad behavior when trying to do something fun and nice for your nephews and nieces. She is learning that her actions have consequences.", "Kelly behaves worse than my 3 year old nephew. This sounds like the find out stage of fucking around. NTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe your nieces and nephews vacations. Kelly didn\u2019t earn the privilege. Allan and Ava did. Leave her the opportunity to show she\u2019s changed in the future, and maybe she\u2019ll catch the next vacation.", "NTA at all.\n\nThey raised a brat. Now they have to deal with the consequences of that. My guess is that she throws a lot of tantrums at home and they placate her by giving her whatever she wants. Also, being an only child likely hasn't helped.", "NTA, if she wants her to go away with other people she should teach her how to behave while she is gone. It is unacceptable for her to act that way, especially away from home. You made the right decision", "Nta kelly needs serious social skills which is on her parents not you, they\u2019re just bitter they don\u2019t get a break from her", "Nope NTA, my daughter is 10! And she know damn well if she goes anywhere even day trips with family and acts out. There\u2019s the end to that. But what I will say is there IS something going on with her you may not be aware of. Children just don\u2019t act out for no reason. Maybe some jealousy, something with the parents. I don\u2019t know but may want to look a tiny bit deeper why she\u2019s acting the way she is. Maybe have a talk with her instead of just dismissing it as bad behavior.", "NTA it sounds to me like Kelly has a case of only child syndrome. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to be responsible for her on overnight trips anymore. You made it clear what your reasons were. If your sister wants to be upset, she can be but you did the right thing.", "You are not the AH. You did the smart thing by giving overnight stays a test run. Kelly is not ready for them and although it might seem unfair to exclude her, it would be more unfair to everyone else to include her and ruin their experience.", "NTA. 10yo is old enough to know that there are consequences to actions. It sounds like she doesn't get enough of that at home. Your sister is an AH, and ultimately at fault for raising a brat.", "NTA - yeah, I wouldn\u2019t invite her either. Maybe try again the next year with a short trip, and make it very clear to your sister that if it goes badly again you\u2019ll be done. Yeah she\u2019s still just a kid, but 10 is old enough to behave for one weekend for your aunt and uncle. \n\nIn my experience kids usually behave *better* for people that aren\u2019t their parents, I can only imagine what goes on at home. Kids let it allll out with the people they feel the most comfortable with, but I have a feeling Kelly\u2019s behavior is a direct result of being an over indulged only child.", "NTA. The parents aren't doing this kid any favors by letter her act like this. She will lose opportunities (like she is with you) right now, she'll lose friends, etc. \n\nThis does not sound like an overly tired not-perfect kid, but like a hellion from the get-go. I imagine she's never had consequences before. Like, she throws a fit for ice cream, she gets ice cream type thing. It sucks for her, in a way, because she's probably never been taught to be different, but that's how it goes.", "NTA. Is your sister an indulgent parent? That's going to cause more and more problems for both of them. The most I would do is let your sister know her behavior is beyond what you can manage and that if she can show she can cooperate with her cousins consider trying a day event nearby.", "NTA.  Overnight trips are a privilege, not a right.  I don't agree that Kelly's behavior is normal for 10 (particularly when the 6-yr-od is behaving just fine), but let's say for the sake of the argument it is.  All that's happening is Kelly is no longer receiving the reward for good behavior, bc she's recently shown she doesn't display good behavior.  Also, some level of acceptable behavior is a requirement for a trip to be a treat instead of a punishment tour for everyone. It's not fair to you, your husband, Allan, and Ava to have future trips ruined bc Kelly does not behave, regardless of the reason.  \n\nYou and your husband should feel good about taking Allan and Ava on an enjoyable trip, rather than being browbeaten into taking a stressful and unsatisfactory trip that includes Kelly.", "NTA", "You are NTA. Kelly has FAFO.", "Your sister is probably just upset because she knows she is raising a brat and was looking forward to having a week off from parenting her child.", "\u00abMe and my husband told my sister that Kelly was nor comming on any more overnight trips with us because of her behaviour\u00bb. I hope that this is not a \u00abforever and ever\u00bb thing.\n\nI say NTA for not wanting to keep bringing her with you for right now, as she has shown that she is just a tad bit to immature right now. But she will also eventually grow up. And I hope she is not permenantly banned from trips with you guys.\n\n*I do say that she will eventually grow up, though there is the thing with her being an only child, that can properly affect her behaviour, even when growing up. And I would make it clear that if she continues to act like this even as she gets older, she will not be allowed to come along.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s not ready.\n\nHowever, in a year or two try and you should perhaps try something small with just her first", "NTA, tell your sister that her daughter will have to sit this trip out due to her previous behaviour.  That Kelly will have to improve her behaviour and prove to you both that she can behave on other shorter trips if she wants to be included.", "Nta,she's absolutely not just being a kid. She's being a brat", "NTA. Kelly's poor behavior is due to her parents. It is not your problem.", ">She says Allan and Ava may be mature/calm for their ages but I am out of line to punish Kelly for not being the exception to her age\n\nKelly IS an exception to her age; most ten-year-olds behave better than that. Also, you aren't \"punishing\" her; you're just declining to reward her bad behavior or allow her to ruin everybody else's trip. Your sister's notion that Kelly's behavior is perfectly acceptable undoubtedly goes a long way toward explaining that behavior. NTA.", "NTA. I feel really sorry for Kelly though, having parents who haven't taught her how to behave. I would also wonder about her home life and why she's acting out like that.", "NTA.\nKelly is 10. She\u2019ll never learn if you don\u2019t enforce consequences for bad behavior.\nI would sit down with Kelly, however, and make it very clear WHY she isn\u2019t coming, and that any future trips will depend on whether or not her behavior improves", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nIf she's 10 and behaving like that, it's because she's learned from her parents that throwing a tantrum gets results. And if her cousin Ava can behave well at 6, the \"she's only 10\" excuse can't even take off, let alone fly.", "First off it's My husband and I...I see me and my blank SO MUCH on reddit it really makes me wonder why so many people have terrible grammar...people of all ages!\n\nRant over...\n\nNTA your niece is 10, not 2 and there's no excuse for her behavior. Her mother needs to teach her daughter manners and gratefulness.\nI wouldn't take her *anywhere* until she has changed and behaves like a child verses a wild animal.", "You really think icing her out is gonna fix her behavior problems? YTA.", "I understand where you're coming from, but at the end of the day, YTA. By your own admission, you set up a system where you could rank your nieces and nephews and exclude them from future events as punishment.\n  \nKelly is an only child, so she was obviously adjusting to staying with other kids and not always getting what she wants. I don't think it's incumbent on you to acclimate her to her cousins, but you're also taking away an opportunity for her to learn. Again, these are ultimately her parents' responsibility, but you are making it harder.\n  \nWhy not invite your sister on one of these trips so she can properly discipline her own kid?", "YTA.  It\u2019s your 10 year old niece.  You\u2019re creating a rift with your sister, her child, and presumably the child\u2019s father.  Expect payback at every opportunity.", "ESH. Some ten year old kids behave like that until they learn better. Hopefully she\u2019s in the process but losing out on trips with her cousins is going to be worse in the long run. She will not put together their behaviour and being allowed to go if she\u2019s this immature. \n\nParents should have taught her better, but the last few years have left little opportunity for kids to interact. At least giving her a second chance seems fair.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
