During the car ride, Kelly was being an instigator and kept trying to start a fight with Allan.

This is beyond 'being an exception to their age' unless there is a developmental delay not noted in the post? If so, then it may just not be the right time for overnight trips for her.\nYou are not obligated to put up with bad behavior when trying to do something fun and nice for your nephews and nieces. She is learning that her actions have consequences.", "Kelly behaves worse than my 3 year old nephew. This sounds like the find out stage of fucking around. NTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe your nieces and nephews vacations. Kelly didn\u2019t earn the privilege. Allan and Ava did. Leave her the opportunity to show she\u2019s changed in the future, and maybe she\u2019ll catch the next vacation.", "NTA at all.\n\nThey raised a brat. Now they have to deal with the consequences of that. My guess is that she throws a lot of tantrums at home and they placate her by giving her whatever she wants. Also, being an only child likely hasn't helped.", "NTA, if she wants her to go away with other people she should teach her how to behave while she is gone. It is unacceptable for her to act that way, especially away from home. You made the right decision", "Nta kelly needs serious social skills which is on her parents not you, they\u2019re just bitter they don\u2019t get a break from her", "Nope NTA, my daughter is 10! And she know damn well if she goes anywhere even day trips with family and acts out. There\u2019s the end to that. But what I will say is there IS something going on with her you may not be aware of. Children just don\u2019t act out for no reason. Maybe some jealousy, something with the parents. I don\u2019t know but may want to look a tiny bit deeper why she\u2019s acting the way she is. Maybe have a talk with her instead of just dismissing it as bad behavior.", "NTA it sounds to me like Kelly has a case of only child syndrome. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to be responsible for her on overnight trips anymore. You made it clear what your reasons were. If your sister wants to be upset, she can be but you did the right thing.", "You are not the AH. You did the smart thing by giving overnight stays a test run. Kelly is not ready for them and although it might seem unfair to exclude her, it would be more unfair to everyone else to include her and ruin their experience.", "NTA. 10yo is old enough to know that there are consequences to actions. It sounds like she doesn't get enough of that at home. Your sister is an AH, and ultimately at fault for raising a brat.", "NTA - yeah, I wouldn\u2019t invite her either. Maybe try again the next year with a short trip, and make it very clear to your sister that if it goes badly again you\u2019ll be done. Yeah she\u2019s still just a kid, but 10 is old enough to behave for one weekend for your aunt and uncle. \n\nIn my experience kids usually behave *better* for people that aren\u2019t their parents, I can only imagine what goes on at home. Kids let it allll out with the people they feel the most comfortable with, but I have a feeling Kelly\u2019s behavior is a direct result of being an over indulged only child.", "NTA. The parents aren't doing this kid any favors by letter her act like this. She will lose opportunities (like she is with you) right now, she'll lose friends, etc. \n\nThis does not sound like an overly tired not-perfect kid, but like a hellion from the get-go. I imagine she's never had consequences before. Like, she throws a fit for ice cream, she gets ice cream type thing. It sucks for her, in a way, because she's probably never been taught to be different, but that's how it goes.", "NTA. Is your sister an indulgent parent? That's going to cause more and more problems for both of them. The most I would do is let your sister know her behavior is beyond what you can manage and that if she can show she can cooperate with her cousins consider trying a day event nearby.", "NTA.  Overnight trips are a privilege, not a right.  I don't agree that Kelly's behavior is normal for 10 (particularly when the 6-yr-od is behaving just fine), but let's say for the sake of the argument it is.  All that's happening is Kelly is no longer receiving the reward for good behavior, bc she's recently shown she doesn't display good behavior.  Also, some level of acceptable behavior is a requirement for a trip to be a treat instead of a punishment tour for everyone. It's not fair to you, your husband, Allan, and Ava to have future trips ruined bc Kelly does not behave, regardless of the reason.  \n\nYou and your husband should feel good about taking Allan and Ava on an enjoyable trip, rather than being browbeaten into taking a stressful and unsatisfactory trip that includes Kelly.", "NTA", "You are NTA.

I hope that this is not a \u00abforever and ever\u00bb thing.\n\nI say NTA for not wanting to keep bringing her with you for right now, as she has shown that she is just a tad bit to immature right now. But she will also eventually grow up. And I hope she is not permenantly banned from trips with you guys.\n\n*I do say that she will eventually grow up, though there is the thing with her being an only child, that can properly affect her behaviour, even when growing up. And I would make it clear that if she continues to act like this even as she gets older, she will not be allowed to come along.", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s not ready.\n\nHowever, in a year or two try and you should perhaps try something small with just her first", "NTA, tell your sister that her daughter will have to sit this trip out due to her previous behaviour.  That Kelly will have to improve her behaviour and prove to you both that she can behave on other shorter trips if she wants to be included.", "Nta,she's absolutely not just being a kid. She's being a brat", "NTA. Kelly's poor behavior is due to her parents. It is not your problem.", ">She says Allan and Ava may be mature/calm for their ages but I am out of line to punish Kelly for not being the exception to her age\n\nKelly IS an exception to her age; most ten-year-olds behave better than that. Also, you aren't \"punishing\" her; you're just declining to reward her bad behavior or allow her to ruin everybody else's trip. Your sister's notion that Kelly's behavior is perfectly acceptable undoubtedly goes a long way toward explaining that behavior. NTA.", "NTA. I feel really sorry for Kelly though, having parents who haven't taught her how to behave. I would also wonder about her home life and why she's acting out like that.", "NTA.\nKelly is 10. She\u2019ll never learn if you don\u2019t enforce consequences for bad behavior.\nI would sit down with Kelly, however, and make it very clear WHY she isn\u2019t coming, and that any future trips will depend on whether or not her behavior improves", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nIf she's 10 and behaving like that, it's because she's learned from her parents that throwing a tantrum gets results. And if her cousin Ava can behave well at 6, the \"she's only 10\" excuse can't even take off, let alone fly.", "First off it's My husband and I...I see me and my blank SO MUCH on reddit it really makes me wonder why so many people have terrible grammar...people of all ages!\n\nRant over...\n\nNTA your niece is 10, not 2 and there's no excuse for her behavior. Her mother needs to teach her daughter manners and gratefulness.\nI wouldn't take her *anywhere* until she has changed and behaves like a child verses a wild animal.", "You really think icing her out is gonna fix her behavior problems? YTA.", "[deleted]", "YTA.  It\u2019s your 10 year old niece.  You\u2019re creating a rift with your sister, her child, and presumably the child\u2019s father.  Expect payback at every opportunity.", "ESH. Some ten year old kids behave like that until they learn better. Hopefully she\u2019s in the process but losing out on trips with her cousins is going to be worse in the long run. She will not put together their behaviour and being allowed to go if she\u2019s this immature. \n\nParents should have taught her better, but the last few years have left little opportunity for kids to interact.

You're under no obligation to bring any kid with you and it's lovely that you take your niblings out voluntarily\n\nBut 10 is old enough for you yourselves to have a conversation with Kelly and explain how what she does makes the experience less nice for everyone else. All behaviour is communication. You could give her 3 strikes to improve or whatever other technique, then say if she doesn\u2019t stop she won't be able to come. There could be a reason she's acting like this and it would be a good opportunity to show her you're actually interested in her as a person, in helping her get to the root of what's bothering her.

This is an apt description of my niece. It\u2019s not Kelly\u2019s fault that she is behaving like this. There is something going on with her. With my niece it\u2019s because she is so over stimulated by having people around (she gets left alone a lot due to both parents working long hours and being an only child).

Well, you are child free people and you don\u2019t have to be her village if all you want is to spend time with easy going children. But she\u2019s not finished growing.

Just as you wouldn\u2019t expect another adult to conform to your rules because you are you. Relationships are a give and take type of thing.

It's okay to bring a snack if you think you'll be hungry.we can help you choose something if you'd like and problem solve how to pack it with us together (whether it goes in a pocket, a purse, a cooler, etc. And if it can be held in the car)  During the car rides we can use our voices to sing along and talk with others but we don't make fun or  say mean things. We keep our seatbelts on until we are parked. When our hands and feet get antsy we can touch (xyz toy) but not our cousins because everyone deserves respect and space, including you. It's important when we play together to know what kind of touches bug and hurt and what is nice or fun. It's important to listen when someone says they don't like something. \n\n At the park, we will have access and time to explore xyz equipment and play xyz games. It's important to stay safe and we don't want to get hurt, so we won't push people down or use our bodies to trip or block people. It's much more fun to jump and play. We have brought (bubbles, jump ropes, blah blah and when we use them, sharing looks like five minutes turns. We can help you if you have questions or feel like something isn't fair. We will let you know when there's ten minutes left and five minutes left before it's time to leave.\n\n It's important to leave at the right time so we can get ice cream! When we choose our ice cream it's important to be polite to the people that work there and each other. Etc.

I also think that just expecting Kelly\u2019s behaviour to just change is likely to be unsuccessful unless expectations are spelled out to her.

And it doesn't mean your sister spoils her, there are just limits to what you can do when bringing up an only child. \n\nThese joint trips would do her a world of good, and you will all settle in better once you've done a few. You all, and especially Kelly, need to get used to your roles and you will find a balance. Don't give up on the first try. \n\nOf course I don't know your sister and her parenting strategy, whether she's spoiling Kelly or not, I'm just saying it doesn't sound like she's a bad kid. These are literally all the things I saw last week on a family trip with my nephew who is an only child, and I realised that my older used to do them too, but not since we have my younger. I was talking to my SIL about it and she knows; there is only so much you can do when you don't have another kid around so your kids can understand these life situations.\n\nI hope you change your mind, you sound like and awesome aunt and uncle and you and the activities you organise with all the cousins could be what makes your niece's character.", "I\u2019m on the fence for this one. It depends what kind of relationship you want to have with your niece. It\u2019s fair that you don\u2019t want to tolerate bad behavior on a trip, but have you talked to Kelly about this? Does she understand why she is being left behind? All she may get from this is being left out of her family. She will never forget being the only one left out and may damage your relationship. It\u2019s worth talking to her about it, maybe she\u2019s home this time, but let her know you will try again. Don\u2019t give up on kids.", "Yta because she will feel terrible and left out. She's a child misbehaving, needs to be disciplined, not punished and ostracised", "My SIL just invited my two oldest to spend the night so our kids could play together. When I dropped them off I told them to act in a way that makes their aunt want to have them over again.", "Oh, please. Any child can become a brat whether they have siblings or not. My only child never behaved like that. This is a parenting issue not an only child issue.", "I also agree with you, and I think that IF as a child free adult you choose to take kids in your life on trips or take responsibility for them, during that time your are in loco parentis and so it does become your job somewhat to address the things that come up, as well as hand the wider ongoing issues (if there are any) back to the parents/ main adults", "Kelly didn't get like this in a bubble.  The parents are clearly the problem", "Normal 10 yo don\u2019t act like toddlers", "First you can bond without a trip. Also her behaviour could build resentment within the cousins just as easily as leaving her will build in her. Op can always get together with her when she\u2019s older and more mature, if she\u2019s still salty about being excluded due to her behaviour she ain\u2019t mature enough", "No she can bond later but not on the trip, the other kids deserve better than that.", "This is absolutely normal behaviour. At 2 or 3. Not 10.", "Not for a 10 yo", "1. Not everyone has English as a first language.\n2. If you're gonna rant about grammar, you should make sure you also write properly. It's \"versus\", not \"verses\"", "Seriously. And at that age, I KNEW that I wanted to be on my very best behavior if I was doing a special thing with other adults. A childish outburst or two is expected, but it sounds like Kelly was pathologically bad.", "Yeah, so the priority should be the kids mental health. Not vacations. This poor girl. Everyone is so quick to write her off because she\u2019s difficult. I feel bad for her because behavior like this is usually indicative of a bigger problem, but I guess what\u2019s more important is making sure OP gets to be the \u201cfun aunt.\u201d", "Absolutely. But if you think this girl isn\u2019t going to remember this the rest of her life and harbor something from it, then you\u2019re wrong. I guess I should\u2019ve said the parents are assholes too for not addressing it, but this whole thing just glosses over the fact this kid WHY this kid has behavior issues in the first place. Her well-being is an afterthought.", "If this is the hill OP wants to die on, that\u2019s her prerogative. The whole situation is more nuanced than a yes/no to going on a trip. I\u2019m just saying that OP is adding this child\u2019s behavior issue if she has to watch her siblings go on vacation and her mom doesn\u2019t work with her to fix her behavior. Hey OP, this child needs love and structure from her FAMILY, not abandonment. I can change my vote to ESH, because they do.", "I like those words for this situation.  The payback will ensue in the future at every opportunity the sibling has.  I suppose OP could try and respond by attacking a ten year old child but I would expect her to focus on her sibling instead.", "Ah child abuse, isn't it wonderful", "I have a 2 1/2 year old and she acts exactly like Kelly lol. Last night she laid on our rough concrete outside, wearing only a diaper, and caterwauled because she couldn\u2019t get her shoes on. When I asked if she wanted helped she howled louder. When I tried to pick up her foot to put her shoe on she yanked it away and hurt it and howled louder. When I ignored her she kept on crying. Finally I picked her up and she was fine. Gotta love this age lol.", "So in order to placate the one child\u2019s feelings and behavior, the other kids either have to have their vacation ruined or worse - not get a vacation at all? \n\nAnd how will that affect THEIR BEHAVIOR?  \n\nYou know since they were well behaved and still get shafted, why behave at all?", "She is 10 and is old enough to have boundaries and consequences. If you cannot mind other adults you don\u2019t get to go on overnight trips. My kids have a similar deal with a relative and if you don\u2019t listen you don\u2019t go. So her staying home this august as a consequence to her last trip seems appropriate. I wouldn\u2019t take unruly kids that aren\u2019t mine for the weekend either.", "NTA. My son is 8. He\u2019s fairly spoiled by me because he\u2019s my only child. He wouldn\u2019t even remotely act that way. I would check in before bed and asked how things were going with you. As soon as I found out I would have driven down and immediately picked his ass up. Middle of the night or not. He would have spent the rest of his weekend with no screens and helping out around home. \nGuess what. I\u2019ve never had to do this to any big extent. In fact when he\u2019s out with other kids the parents usually comment on how well behaved he is. We have expectations for behavior and I follow through on punishments. It only took a couple times for him to understand I don\u2019t play. It\u2019s been a couple years now since I\u2019ve even had to give him the stink eye. \nThere\u2019s a much bigger problem the sister needs to get sorted or this child\u2019s behavior will continue to go downhill into adulthood.", "I have two different cousins that are only children. One is rather spoiled, the other is one of the nicest most considerate guys you\u2019ll ever meet. My youngest sister is more of a spoiled brat than the spoiled cousin and she was never an only child. It\u2019s really down to personality and parenting.", "That ONLY children are selfish and ill-mannered is a myth - they are no more or less likely to be brats than children with siblings.  My child is an only, and didn\u2019t have behavior problems, while I grew up in a family of 7 and a few of my siblings were nightmares, and some of their multiple children are also.  How many siblings you have means nothing - it\u2019s how you are parented.", "You need to make this whole story into a post please", "They don't even know either. All they say is \"do you like imagination????\"", "Something other than causing drama with their 10 year old niece, sibling, etc.", "I worked with kids for a few years and I agree with you so hard. Well-behaved children are now the minority. I couldn't believe the way the older kids would speak to us. I wouldn't have spoken to my parents like that, nevermind a random adult.", "I feel like everyone that says similar comments forgets to add that\u2019s it\u2019s also the quantity of help. My mom and uncles had lots of help from friends, siblings and grandparents when raising their kids. Most people I know are lucky to have any family help and they barely see their kids because of how much they work. \n\nNot discounting that yes, entitled asshole kids absolutely exist and their parents are part of the problem but not every poorly behaved child is the result of bad parenting, sometimes it\u2019s because that don\u2019t get enough attention and barely see their parents in the first place.", "i was an only child and i didn\u2019t get away with ANYTHING. my parents would\u2019ve had my ass if i\u2019d tried anything like what kelly did. and i honestly believe i was a better parent when i only had one child, so props to OP\u2019s brother for raising TWO really well behaved kids.", "I was an only child, and at no point did I desire to start fights with my cousins during road trips, or chuck tantrums in shops because I couldn't buy all of the shiny things.\n\nThat sounds like an attention problem - as in, Kelly needs attention, and isn't getting the appropriate quality of it. But while community support helps, it's generally best as a parent to NOT irrirate the heck out of your potential support people.", "ok", "So your solution is that she just gets to act bratty? She is a child but this is the time you teach her consequences. If she behaves then she gets to do all the fun things! If she cannot behave then she doesn\u2019t get the fun. That is a simple lesson and one that a 10 year old can understand. Teaching her that she can act however she wants and still get to do fun stuff is the opposite lesson! That is how you create an entitled adult. \n\nI would do the same rules for my own kids. You don\u2019t listen then you cannot go overnight with other adults. Simple as that.", "Atp you should propose a real alternative, because rn you're only showing you don't have any alternative either", "Exactly. Parenting is done right when for each good action there is a reward/love and for each bad action ,there is an equal consequence.", "I also have an only, and there would be serious consequences for this kind of behavior.  I would be horrified.", "What??? Wow that\u2019s ridiculously rude. Was she upset when you refused to keep them?", "So what is YOUR solution?  Can you imagine how the two well behaved cousins are going to feel if OP acquiesces?  Their gifted vacations are always ruined and/or centered around this cousin.  Their behaving appropriately and with gratitude, but their cousin who didn\u2019t is still being rewarded.  \n\nWho is going to be resentful then?  How do you reinforce good, genuine, appreciative, mannerly behavior when the immediate examples in your own family prove otherwise?\n\nThis was a GIFT to the nibblings.  GIFTS are not entitlements.  And the niece was not NOT PERFECT.  She was destructive and rude and literally threw away food because she didn\u2019t want to wait for dessert.  \n\nWhy do YOU keep dismissing this behavior as just \u201cnot perfect\u201d?", "It\u2019s not your kid so it\u2019s not your problem.  Stay out of it.", "I completely understand what you mean. It\u2019s just difficult for some people to not take anything personally, there\u2019s always, and I mean ALWAYS, some reply of \u201cwell I am and I never do that \ud83d\ude24\u201d\n\nI think the first time I realized this was a generalized comment someone made about people who wear sunglasses indoors. The amount of people that chimed in to yell that \u201cthey do but only bc x reason and you\u2019re being rude and ignorant!\u201d \n\nOr the crazy hypotheticals: what if they had no eyeballs?! You\u2019re discriminating against the disabled! \n\nBut back to this, my ex husband was an only child, obv I agree with your point lol", "You think I\u2019m being pedantic but not the post I was replying to? Lmao okay.", "What are you even talking about? If you make yourself unpleasant to be around, people will choose to stop being around you. Thats not punishing, thats common sense. 10 year old is old enough to know better, hence why the cousins still get to go.", "And yet the 10 year old and her family are upset.  OP is free to harm her relationship with her sister and her niece to discipline a little girl.  Seems stupid and immature to me.", "The sister? I agree. It is stupid and immature to not teach basic behavior to your kid and get upset when they get left out. Again, there not trying to discipline , they\u2019re removing an unpleasant element from an otherwise pleasant situation."]}
