She is a smart, kind and a friendly kid so of course she gets a lot attention.\n\nShe wasn't really interested in dating so far but now she has a crush. The boy is 15 and two years might not be a lot but at this age I think it is.\n\nThe boy asked her out and my niece asked my sister if she could go. She was excited for her daughter and allowed her to go. When my BIL found out he put a hard stop to this. My niece broke down crying, that she already told the boy they can go. My BIL said she needs to cancel and my sister started arguing with BIL that he has no right to say no when she already agreed. This resulted in a pretty ugly screaming match between all 3.\n\nMy sister called and asked me if she and my niece could spend the night? I agreed and when they came my niece hugged me and was crying her heart out. I asked what happened and they told me about the date and argument. My sister started berating my BIL and my niece agreed and it broke my heart a little because BIL would give his life for his two girls.\n\nMy sister asked what I think about this and I said that BIL is right. That I wouldn't let my daughter date this early and someone older. They both got mad at me and wanted to go to a hotel for the night but my husband talked them out of it.\n\nHe sat my niece down and asked her about the boy. Turns out he had some girlfriends already and is football player who has a certain reputation. My niece didn't even realiaze what this could mean for her, she never even held a boy's hand before. So we explained as gently as possible why it's not a good idea to date older boys. \n\nAfter this she agreed she will cancel the date and she called her dad to pick her up. I thought everything is good after this but my sister screamed at me and my husband that it's not our place to parent her daughter. I just said that she asked for my opinion. She replied that she will never do that again because my opinions are outdated.\n\nWhen my BIL showed up my niece apologized to him and he thanked us for the help. My sister walked out of my house without even saying goodbye. And now a week after this incident she still isn't talking to me.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1676483309, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1133y7j/aita_for_saying_my_bil_is_right_when_he_doesnt/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But your sister, BIL and you are TA. You all dismissed the girl instead of talking to hear what that guy is all about and what dating actually means.", "NTA- she asked your opinion and you gave it.  Sometimes all kids need is to be spoken to with respect. Stand your ground bc your niece is going to have a bumpy road ahead of her & she might be coming to you for guidance more often. Your sisters actions of leaving her husband and siding with her child is a major red flag.", "NTA\n\n13yo girl shouldn't be dating anyone who isn't in the same grade. Definitely not a 15/16yo football boy.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd honestly, this isn't even about what I, or anyone else, thinks about 13-year-olds dating. It's about exactly TWO THINGS in this specific situation that are very concerning, and that I think you and your husband addressed really thoughtfully:\n\n1) The fact that when you actually sat down and spoke DIRECTLY to your niece in a thoughtful and respectful manner about the situation, about her choices, and about what dating a boy two years older than her might entail in terms of maturity, life experience, and expectations, that SHE DECIDED FOR HERSELF that maybe she wasn't ready, and that it was probably better to cancel the date. Not because she was forced to, but because there were issues that she had been unaware of (that \"dating\" at his age, and his having had previous girlfriends might mean different expectations than the kids in her grade and at her age had), and by talking it out she was able to make a more informed decision for herself . . .and that decision was that maybe even if she really liked him, she was not ready to go on a date with him. \n\nIt sounds like a good, honest, calm heart-to-heart convo is exactly what your niece needed, along with a realistic talk about what dating can mean. You didn't \"butt in\" . . . you offered information and yes, an opinion, but you didn't yell or demand like EITHER of her parents. You gave her the lay of the land and let her consider it. And it sounds like she's a smart kid who was able to take that information and make a better decision for herself about what she was ready for. And SHE decided that she is not ready for dating an older boy yet. But also . . . \n\n2) It's really worrisome that even after your niece decided for herself that she wanted to cancel the date that your sister was still pushing for her to go, and angry at you. It seems to imply that your sister is more interested in her daughter growing up quickly, dating, or perhaps the social standing of having her daughter date a popular football player, than she is in her daughter's well-being and choices FOR HERSELF about what she is ready to handle socially and romantically (not to mention sexually). That is far, far from okay. I've known girls whose mothers pushed them into dating and relationships they weren't ready for because \"social standing\", and it can get ugly and traumatic FAST. \n\nYou are NTA. Despite agreeing with your BIL, you still gave your niece *room to decide for herself, after giving her more information that she didn't have previously, and that she clearly appreciated and was surprised about*. It's important to arm kids with as much info as possible so they can make good choices. I think you did good.", "NTA. a lot of times these types of conversations are easier to have with an aunt and uncle because they don't typically see you as a parent figure just telling them what to do all the time. They view you more as a fun older friend. So its easier to sneak parenting advise in without them already being on defense. No 13 year old wants to listen to their parents or think that parents have their best interests in mind.", "In my opinion, NTA. 13 year olds shouldn't be dating anyone that isn't in the same grade as them, especially not a 15/16 year old. I would be worried about grooming/manipulation happening there.", "NTA. All the YTAs here must be overlooking the fact that your sister and BIL literally brought this problem into your home. You were trying to comfort your niece by helping her understand her father\u2019s point of view and she ended up agreeing with you. Your advice brought peace into your sister\u2019s household so I don\u2019t get why she\u2019s so angry with you.", "NTA-your BIL is right and so are you. Your Sister is absolutely wrong.  First, they should have had this conversation long ago and been on the same page.  Second, as the mother of 2 sons, you can educate them, monitor them, teach them and there are still some boys that act horrid as a result of raging hormones. You are thinking of your nieces safety which is not outdated.  Think your sister needs a reality check.", ">my sister screamed at me and my husband that it's not our place to parent her daughter. I just said that she asked for my opinion\n\nSister's putting misjudged context in your mouth and getting offended in advance for it. What you said here was 100% correct, and if she disagrees with that, there were better ways to bring it up. **NTA**", "NAH as it's a tricky situation. But forbidding stuff like this is a recipe for sneaking around instead of being open and honest. Probably did more harm than good.", "NTA, it sounds like your sister didn't really know anything about the other kid and I feel like this is probably as much about her hurt pride (all the adults disagreed with her *and then* it turned out the potential date was ... less than ideal) as much as her being offended that you and your husband overstepped.\n\nBut it sounds like your niece already came around, or is starting to, and I'm sure her mom will as well.\n\n\\[edited for spelling\\]", "I think your husband was MVP here. He handled the situation really well.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour sister asked for your input, you gave it.  It just wasn't the answer she wanted to hear.  That's why she's upset.  If she wants a pregnant 13yo, that's on her.\n\nSister says BIL has no right to say no when she already agreed.  Flip that around.  Sister has no right to agree without BIL knowing or having input.", "NTA. 2 years is a big difference when one is a 13yo who has never even held a boy\u2019s hand and the other is  a 15 yo that\u2019s already been in multiple relationships and apparently has a bad reputation.", "NTA. If she didn't want your opinion, she shouldn't have come running to you and asked you for it.", "NTA. Sounds like you should ask your sister why she's so angry her 13 year old daughter didn't get taken advantage of by some high school popular playboy?\n\nAnd maybe add in that she can not like your answer all she wants, but has no right to get angry at you when they asked for your opinion.", "13 is too young for dating", "NTA- your sister shouldn't have involved your niece in this conversation at all. She needs to parent with your BIL and reach an agreement regarding the conditions they both feel comfortable with your niece dating. She doesn't need to berate your BIL in front of your niece (your BIL is presumably her father).\n\nYour sister shouldn't ask your opinion if she wasn't prepared for the possibility you wouldn't agree. Your sister is behaving ridiculously- why is she being this dramatic about people disagreeing with her? If all that happened was that you agreed with your BIL, then it's so dramatic for her to want to got a hotel because you gave your honest opinion which is pretty reasonable. A thirteen year old is probably in middle school (7th or 8th grade). Two years' age difference at that age is pretty big.", "NTA. She's way too young to be dating.   \n\n\nIn my opinion, dating young is pretty useless and is a sure fire way to get yourself in a relationship that sucks and make really bad decisions, but you won't be able to tell because it's the only thing you know, and you haven't experiences life enough yet to know what you actually want and don't want in a relationship; not to mention her brain isn't even developed enough to make mature decisions through all the hormones.", "NTA. This is a case where she will thank you for it later.", "NTA.\n\nthere\u2019s a big difference between a 13 year old who has never even held hands & a 15 year old who has apparently already got a reputation", "NTA\u2026not sure why mom was excited for a first date with a boy 2 yrs older. Kids don\u2019t understand the concept of dating and reputations. Sucks that it\u2019s worse for girls/women. \n\nNiece was educated about commitments, expectations and perceptions about dating. I\u2019m sure if BIL could\u2019ve articulated better, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. That boys mom should be ashamed of their parenting choices.", "NTA\n15 year old boys are only after one thing and it ain't hand-holding", "NTA\n\nSure that\u2019s two years, but in pretty much every school, that\u2019s the difference between someone in middle school and someone in high school. The maturity levels are SO different.", "NTA she\u2019s a thirteen yr old girl there\u2019s no way", "NTA lol if someone doesn't want to hear your opinion they shouldn't ask.", "NTA. The \"Half-your-age + 7\" guideline definitely applies here (and should for the vast majority of teenage couplings). Your husband followed the most sensible course in getting your niece to reconsider the date, and seeing her dad's perspective.", "NTA. They shouldn't ask for your opinion if they don't want to hear it. I don't think you should've been part of the discussion with her father about why she shouldn't date; your sister may be angry about that", "NTA. She asked your opinion and you gave it. She overreacted.", "NTA it sounds rather creepy that a 15-year-old boy would want to date a 13-year-old girl.", "NTA your sister is though.", "NTA for the situation. She asked your opinion, she's only upset because you didn't agree. \n\nWhile I believe 13 is fine to date, the age dynamic here is unsettling. 2 years is nothing out of school, but IN school that's the difference between Jr high and high school, plus maturity levels are VASTLY different. I would be wary of this, but ultimately a teen is gonna do what a teen is gonna do, all we can do is educate and hope they make good choices. Your hubs sat down and educated, gave the control back to her, that was a good move. Teens respond better when they feel they have control of their lives (they know all \ud83e\udd23)", "NTA\n \nShe asked your opinion.  \nDad could have totally insisted on chaperoning!", "I'm confused on what is considered a date at those ages. They can see a PG movie. They can go to the mall, arcade, for a walk...but how are they getting there? 15yo can't drive solo with a learner's permit. \n\nAnd how is this date being paid for? By mom and dad? \n\nThe *only* way my 13yo daughter is going on a \"date\" with anyone, let alone a 15yo, is if the \"date\" is on our couch watching a movie with the rest of the family or playing a board game. \n\nThe sister is way weird for skipping over all the, \"what's his name? how do you know him? does he have brothers and sisters?\" to gushing over the big \"date\" and picking out nail polish colors like she's...not the mother, but a bestie.", "Slight YTA. Yes, she asked for your opinion. You gave it, she didn't agree, that's fine. But in no way should you or your husband have tried to impress y'all's opinion on this girl, who has already had to take in the opinions of both of her parents on a very stressful night.", "YTA.\n\nNot for telling your sister that you agree with your BIL. She asked for your opinion and you gave it. If that were the end of it, then I'd say you're in the clear, but it wasn't the end of it. \n\nYou say your husband 'sat her down and asked her about the boy' which paints a pretty clear picture that you two put yourself further into situation than just offering your opinion. THAT makes both you and your husband AHs. Neither one of you actually know this boy, but you're making judgement calls because he plays football and has girlfriends before? That's ridiculous. It's not your job to 'convince' her who she should and shouldn't date, particularly based on rumors of a person that you don't even know.", "YTA for reasons others have already mentioned. You started off great offering them a place to stay. When asked an opinion you gave it, that's fine. When your husband started getting involved in nieces business and asking follow-up questions, that's not OK. The girl already has two parents, your sister was in an emotional state, and your judgement was not requested or required. Apologize to your sister for butting in on a family affair, no excuses.", "YTA. Not for giving an opinion when asked - that's completely reasonable. But it was not your or your husband's place to sit down and talk to your neice about this. You knew that your BIL and sister were not on the same page and should have let them get on with it. Instead, you overstepped.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
