He paid very well - much more than I have ever been paid - so after speaking with my husband, I accepted. (My husband and I are both 27.) There were some nude shots involved, so my husband gave his ok with the condition that he must be present. The photographer said fine of course, but I was a little embarrassed to have to make that request. \n\nAnyway, the session went great, and the photographer is very talented. He gave me a framed print of one of the best shots as a gift, which I am super proud of. I\u2019d like to hang it up in our room or bathroom, but my husband has forbid it, and said he\u2019s actually not happy that I even have a copy. He doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. \n\nSome close friends of ours (married couple) knew I was doing this shoot and asked about it, and I said it went great and I got a print that is beautiful. They asked to see it, if I\u2019m fine with it. I said I am, but my husband isn\u2019t. This led to a whole big discussion/argument among the 4 of us - my husband said I threw him under the bus, and not-very-jokingly accused them of only wanting to see me nude because I\u2019m African American (he and this couple are white). Needless to say it was extremely embarrassing. (They had at one point made a comment about not having seen an AA woman nude before as an off handed silly comment that was taken out of context.) \n\nSo, these friends stayed overnight at our place Saturday night, and before they arrived he reminded me AGAIN that they were not allowed to see the print. I said yes, fine, but I was seething, exhausted by how he was controlling this. At one point when he was in the bathroom I apologized to them for this whole thing, and they said they were fine (but said they were disappointed they wouldn\u2019t finally be able to see an AA woman naked, which made me laugh so hard that my husband asked what was so funny and I said nothing.)\n\nI didn\u2019t sleep well that night - I was angry thinking about how I had close friends that wanted to share art I had created, but my husband wasn\u2019t being supportive. So, in that state of mind I made a rash decision. After my husband left for a meeting Sunday morning, I didn\u2019t show them the print, but I brought them coffee to their room, wearing absolutely nothing. \n\nWe laughed our asses off.

Such a strange situation that you made stranger. What point were you trying to prove by flashing your friends after your husband already told you he didn\u2019t want them seeing you naked?

Sexualising you because you\u2019re black wouldn\u2019t be okay but openly being chatty and jokey about how it\u2019s weird they\u2019ve never seen a black women naked (because it IS weird that black women aren\u2019t seen more in print etc) seems more like a sharing of their acknowledgment of the EFFECT of structural racism to me. I hope my rambling makes sense?!\n\nSecondly, I\u2019m not loving the controlling vibes your husband is giving off over this. It\u2019s your body and I think your response was HILARIOUS! I literally burst out laughing and now wish you were MY friend because you sound awesome.\n\nI get why you feel guilty because yes, your husband probably won\u2019t like it and that\u2019s sad for him but it\u2019s also tough luck because it\u2019s not his call. Be kind to him when you explain that he doesn\u2019t actually get a say in when you are naked or not and why even internalised misogyny isn\u2019t something you\u2019re going to tolerate.\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s an AH, he\u2019s just gone a little off track and needs to take a look at the subtext of what he, a white man, is saying to a black woman, about who owns her body\u2026", "NTA\n\nIts ur body, ur husband doesn't control what you do. You should tell him for honesty's sake but you guys need to confront the deeper issue that is clear here.", "Your husband is TA and he is insecure and controlling \n\nYou offering to show the picture when others asked to see it and them asking to see it NTA ...its nearly 2023 ffs times have changed \nIf he is sexualising an artistic picture of you and justifying it by throwing the card in too boot it's concerning what will he do if you have a girl together ...imo you should consider leaving your husband in the past where his racist and sexist views lay \n\nNta nta nta", "NTA. it\u2019s not great that you went behind his back, but it\u2019s your body and you\u2019re allowed to do whatever you want with it. \nA friend did a boudoir photo shoot last year and her husband was upset that she was posting the photos on social media, or sharing the photographers posts. She said \u201cI\u2019m sorry if it makes you upset but it\u2019s my body and if I\u2019m comfortable sharing it then that\u2019s up to me. We can work on how to make you more comfortable with the idea of it\u201d\n\nYou did cross a boundary and you need to talk to him abt it, but nakedness is so normal and human and his issues with it aren\u2019t your responsibility to cater to.", "If your comfortable with your both and your friends are also, he needs to deal with his problems.

You didn't show the photo.  \n\nI just feel uneasy about your husband.  Wanting to know what you were laughing about.  He does sound very controlling.  He's making it seem like your close friends have a fetish to see a naked AA lady.", "Nta - Your body, your friends, your choice. This isn't some random guy in a bar, this is a married couple you are friends with and trust. It wasn't done in a sexual way, it was funny and received as such in your own home. Your husband could do with examining why he feels embarrassed about this because it's probably rooted in some not great ideas even if they lie completely below the conscious layer of thought and self awareness.\n\nHe agreed to the photos, I assume he's sharing in the money YOU were paid for YOUR ART. He has every right to feel uncomfortable, and you should absolutely support and be open to discussing his feelings, but that's as far as what you owe to him extends in my mind. \n\nI wouldn't go so far as to say he is the asshole, but I would get a bit of ick feeling if my partner behaved in this way and want to challenge him to explore where his feelings are really coming from. Like what's the actual danger here? He doesn't own you, this isn't the olden days, your not bringing shame on his good name... You were having a giggle with some mates and your proud of something you've done, he should be supportive not embarrassed.", "NTA\u2014 he shouldn\u2019t control who you share your photograph with AND there is nothing wrong with wanting to serve people coffee naked if both the other party (your friends) and you are comfortable with it.

I'm not sure why you were OK with him saying he \"had to be there\" for you doing a nude photoshoot - he's either super insecure or he doesn't trust you. Either way it's not a good look.", "You owe it to your husband to tell him that he doesn't own you and cannot control who does or doesn't see your body. Of course he can object and of course he can have his own opinion, but your body is yours and if you want someone to see it, that is your choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA for being upset", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour body, your choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Do I owe it to him to tell him?2 ..

Sorry, no idea how you deal with this pettiness.", "NTA", "Lmao NTA this was such a great twist", "NTA", "NTA. You get to decide what you do with your body and who sees it. This is a \u201cboundary\u201d that shouldn\u2019t exist.", "So if this is real, NTA. Your husband is aware that technically, those nude photos of you belong to the photographer (assuming you signed a release) and could be seen by anybody. Still, I think it is up to you if you choose to show that print to someone else.\n\nThe issue that some are bringing up is that your friends sound racist. Again, if this is real, from a historical standpoint, naked African/African American women were put on display for white people to look and see. There are racial implications in what they are \"joking\" about. They could google and see a naked African American woman. I find your solution funny, but, not to be that redditor, there is some education that needs to happen here. I think your friends just wanted to see you naked.", "I'm not going to make a judgement, only query, a lot of the comments are equating nudity to sex/sexualising which IMO is very culture dependent (I'm guessing US). Is this true of your culture (as a couple) or is it more.... European?", "NTA: You have the right to choose what you do with your body. Your husband has the right to choose how he will react to that.\n\nIf your husband finds out, it should be from you. Just to remove the taint of deception involved here.", "[deleted]", "Fake", "NAH ? I feel a bit bad for your husband but he is bein a bit controlling, your friends are also a bit weird", "NTA or NAH. And I cackled at your solution. Hilarious.\n\nObviously my judgement is gonna be wildly unpopular but I'm kind of surprised by the amount of people who think anyone gets to control who gets to see how much of YOUR body. \n\nYeah, it's great that you found a compromise for the shoot. And he is certainly allowed to feel discomforted and share those feelings, and I hope you both keep talking about why and work together to a point of better compromise. But at the end of the day, it is your body, your art, your profession... and his word isn't law on who you choose to share those photos with.\n\nIs he also then within his right to be upset or leave you cuz he can't handle this branch of your profession, or to feel upset that you'd be okay with showing your body to friends and strangers? Sure. But you're equally at right to be upset or leave him for trying to control who you share your portfolio with and how, and for feeling upset that he doesn't trust you enough (dude couldn't even trust you to be with the photographer on your own, and you were embarrassed by the request so obv if it was a protective gesture it was a failure). Hopefully no one leaves anyone and you just communicate and find a way forward! \n\nIf you plan to keep expanding your portfolio and allow nude portraits, I definitely suggest having a deeper conversation about whether he's gonna be able to handle that. Express why it's important to you to be able to freely share that part of your life with people you trust, and how it's not a sexual thing for you - and listen to his reasons for why he's struggling. Also emphasize this is your WORK. And it sounds like you're proud of the work and yourself and you should be! You deserve to feel good about your portfolio and the results.\n\n(Your friends come off poorly for the weird comments but you're the best judge, knowing the context, for whether it was icky or not.)\n\nETA: Folks are entitled to feel differently than me, but I would 100 percent have put my girlfriend's gorgeous photographed body on the wall if she wanted it there. Maybe he'd feel better if it was in one of those bigger connected frames, accompanied by some clothed images??", "I wouldn\u2019t say asshole, but maybe you took it too far.\n\nThis is funny though.", "NTA, it\u2019s your body and you can decide who sees it. art, including nude photography, isn\u2019t inherently sexual or pornographic, so this can\u2019t be compared to something like sending nudes. your husband shouldn\u2019t have any control over what your body looks like or who can see it. if you\u2019re comfortable with it, that\u2019s all that matters. your husband is most definitely TA here.", "You probably shouldn\u2019t have done that. But I disagree with all the people saying how much you broke your husbands trust. \n\nThis is your body, he already needed to be there for the photo shoot, won\u2019t let you hang the photo or show it to friends. And people keep saying you\u2019re disrespecting his boundaries. He\u2019s not letting you do anything. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m too young or whatever but the husband is doing wayyy to much here. And that resulted in you doing even more. Honestly I laughed when you said it and thought it was funny and petty. \n\nAs a black woman I do think the comments from your friends are a little sus. But that\u2019s not what I wanted to get into. \n\nI would honestly feel a little weird telling the photographer \u201cyea we can do the shoot but my husband has to watch to make sure everything goes okay\u201d like having someone there with you for photos is great and all but it feels a little motherly. \n\nAnd yes I understand we all have boundaries and they need to be respected but it\u2019s your house too. If you wanted to hang a photo of yourself you should be able to. You should be able to share it with friends(who hopefully aren\u2019t racist or have any weird fetish\u2019s) \n\nESH", "NTA.\n\nYou are the only person who gets to decide what you do. The only thing he can do is decide what he does. If you're comfortable with your friends seeing you nude, it's entirely up to you whether you show them a photo or strip down. \n\nIt's not a \"boundary\" for him that you can't share--his boundaries only apply to him. He can decide that he doesn't want to be in a relationship with you, and that's it. \n\nWere I you, I'd be questioning the realtionship with somebody who is controlling and obviously doesn't trust you to make your own decisions.", "**This one is an oddly complicated AITA. Final verdict, ESH.** Here is how I came to this ruling. \n\n**I will begin by looking at the husband's actions.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>not-very-jokingly accused them of only wanting to see me nude because I\u2019m African American\n\n**First**...WUT\n\nI hate to say it, but that *reeks* of projection... it might be your hubby who is the one that actually has a touch of \"jungle fever.\" You might have been fetishized. hard to say for sure though. If that's not the case, then this is still probably a nasty manifestation of some control issues, although I suppose it could be just a bad way of dealing with anxiety.  \n\n**Here, I am comfortable ruling hubby the asshole.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Second**\\- I do fully support your husband in not allowing the nude picture to go up on the bathroom wall. Artwork requires two YES's, and both partners should have full veto powers over everything, *especially* nude artwork. I can't really blame him for not wanting nudity on the walls of his house. If that isn't him, that's not him. \n\nI am also not going to go so far as to say a significant other shouldn't have a voice and some amount of say in whether or not a partner's nudes/naked body are shown to people outside the marriage. \n\nHOWEVER, there is a BIG difference between him saying something like, \"I am simply not comfortable with you showing them the nudes, please don't show them even if they ask,\" and, \"they are not ALLOWED to see the nudes.\" \n\n>he reminded me AGAIN that they were not allowed to see the print.\n\nThe first is a partner asking an equal to respect his comfort level. The second is a demand of an inferior. Now, obviously it's hard to judge for certain since you are the one telling his side, and paraphrasing at that. But if this is how he framed it, this paired with the other comment could represent a problem. **On this issue though I will defer a ruling due to a lack of information.** Context and word choice is king in this sort of thing, and we are lacking both. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Now we move onto OP's actions.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They asked to see it, if I\u2019m fine with it. I said I am, but my husband isn\u2019t.\n\n... What the fuck OP, you DID throw him under the bus. You are supposed to be presenting a united front. You literally could have just said \"no\" and that would be that. No need to make it SUPER CLEAR to everyone that your husband was the issue here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Next**, we come to the issue of you walking into the room nude. Ultimately, I think \"your body\" means \"your choice,\" and therefore who you let see you nude either in person (in a nudist sense, not a sexual sense) or via a nude shot is theoretically only up to you. However, as previously stated, I do believe your partner has a right to be consulted and have his opinion aired before you can just arbitrarily show off your body in a committed partnership. The same would apply to something like permanent physical changes to one's body, such as getting a tattoo. While at the end of the day it is your choice, it DOES impact your partner as well, and you would owe him a heads-up and a chance to be heard before you (or he) could just get an arm sleeve or whatever.\n\nHowever, it is clear that your husband *did* make his opinion on this matter known, and you obviously chose to intentionally ignore it/live up to the letter but not the spirit. Just because you *can* do something, that doesn't mean you *should* do it, and you might still be an asshole for disregarding his wishes and comfort level even if at the end of the day the choice is yours to make. \n\nClearly, you were trying to push his buttons with this act, which in a vacuum would be an asshole move. However, it isn't in a vacuum. It is in response to controlling behavior from your partner (which in his defense was made because you threw him under the bus). The question therefore ends up being, **\"Is the husband's controlling behavior enough to justify this blatant effort by OP to piss off her significant other with a display of her free will through exposing herself?\"** \n\nI have to say that I would say after evaluating all aspects of this, I would say it was not justified. It does sound like he was being controlling, but you also clearly resented him and punished him for not being as comfortable with you being nude as you are, for example when you threw him under the bus. \n\nIf you had said something like this to him at the very beginning (after hearing him out) then I think you would have been N T A. *\"I respect that you are not fully comfortable with this, but this is something I feel strongly about and am proud of. I think this photo is beautiful, and it took a lot of courage for me to take it at all, and I am going to own that pride and courage by showing it to our friends. If it would make you feel better, I will show it to them when you aren't around.\"* \n\nBut you didn't do that. You threw him under the bus, he reacted defensively and lashed out (and was a controlling asshole about it), then you poured fuel on the fire by intentionally walking out naked (even if he doesn't know about it yet). \n\n**There was a right way to go about this, and a wrong way, and you chose the wrong asshole way.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**In conclusion, you were an asshole to him for throwing him under the bus when talking to your friends and for not respecting his comfort level regarding you being nude around others enough to treat him with respect. He acted like an asshole by making a truly horrific remark and possibly being very controlling in the aftermath of your throwing him under the bus. You are both assholes, Everybody Sucks Here.**", "NTA it\u2019s your body and your husband is being extremely controlling. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to want to assist you to the shoot to make sure you\u2019re safe, that\u2019s pretty standard for women to bring a friend/partner to a nude shoot for her safety. \n\nBut he has no right to dictate who sees your body. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s one thing if you asked him and genuinely wanted to know his comfort level, but the fact that he is forbidding it, reminding you of his control, and then getting angry about this is completely out of line. \n\nYou are in charge of your body. If he\u2019s uncomfortable that\u2019s for him to work through or decide it\u2019s a deal breaker, but it\u2019s not up to him to make decisions for you or forbid you from doing what you want with your body and depictions of it.", "NTA you live in the skin that you are in!

Gotta talk to the GF and figure out a way to be okay with it or break up. \nI personally have an OF and do actually send pics to random strangers, and my partner is okay with it because we have talked about it and set boundaries. \n\nI guess I put NTA as a way to validating the OP\u2019s needs to take ownership of her body, when in reality ESH because she did blatantly cross a line that her partner set.", "Lady, when the SO is acting a bit too possessive, it's your turn to ask if you're comfortable with him being this way.", "Funny, you seem proud enough to clap and laugh about it like you said", "Lmfao you sure seem like the expert", "Thank you! Yeah, I was baffled by that. It's not as if anyone's going to see if in your private rooms, and it can be taken down for guests as a compromise. And boundaries go both ways - she compromised on her own work boundaries already by inviting him to put limitations on her opportunity, if it'd make him more comfortable. But she can't even hang a photo she was proud of in her own bedroom?", "They were more respectful than that.", "They 100% were. There is literally 0 joke behind seeing a women of colour naked. They just wanted to see her naked and used that as a way to soften it, which unfortunately worked...", "I considered that but I really don\u2019t think so.", "Exactly. You can tell she despises her husband enough to do something that hurt him. Your friends have Google, they can Google a nude AA. You knew he was hurt after you showed the picture yet chose to hurt him again by showing your friends your naked body.. which they have already seen from the picture you showed them. And now you want to keep it a secret from him. Tell him or leave him because he deserves better.", "I\u2019m totally open to criticism but not beratement.", "I care about all of them. And they aren\u2019t racist.", "Thanks for this!", "Agree. This thread would go apeshit if a husband told his wife what she could and couldn't wear. If women get to decide what to do with their bodies, they should also get to decide who gets to see it. \n\nI love her solution.", "Yeah, I should consider that, I know.", "Well said", "I agree. It's like they want to see if her body is the same as white people or something wtf. It's so weird that they kept insisting despite the husband repeatedly saying he didn't want them to see it.  Someone mentioned swingers, and that's a vibe I got too.", "So YTA in the end", "Not my best moment.", "same here! i immediately got the ick and thought of times men told me \u201ci\u2019ve never (enter weird comment here) with a black woman before", "Girl same if someone said that to me they\u2019d get tf out of my house and life and her husband could see what they were doing", "As a white dude, I made a face when I read this!", "It's called fetishization and it's gross AF.", "I agree the first comment about never having seen that wasn't too weird but its concerning that after it was shut down later when she was alone they guilted her saying they were dissapointed they didn't get to see her naked.", "You need to educate yourself on why it\u2019s wrong", "You dont own her body and her choices because you married her. You don't even know if they are in a religious marriage or not. Courthouse or church wedding people can get naked alike!\n\nWhy are y'all so uptight about the human body!?

Thats the thing. None of this was sexual.", "Was I the AH.", "Then that is fair enough. But I would say that the default is to *not* so stuff like that in a relationship and that the boundaries exist from the start, unless a discussion is had where one partner has a condition to do X even when in a relationship. And if X is unacceptable yo the other partner, then it won't work out.", "I clapped?", "Never claimed to be, im just someone saying my shit and people are agreeing with my sentiments", "You literally said they wanted to see you naked because of your race. They used the word 'finally'. It's creepy. \n\nYour husband said he wasn't comfortable with showing them the picture. \n\nYou then served then coffee totally naked. For what? A moment of ego boost? Defiance? Because its forbidden? \n\nI was honestly on your side, but I just can't be anymore. And you need to tell your husband that you crossed this really hard boundary that he was explicit in communicating with you.\n\nI do support people having these kind of shoots, and I am totally for body positivity, but this isn't that.", "Maybe it is your paraphrasing of what they said.  But to me there is a creepy undertone.  \n\nIf you considered it, then you picked up on something.  I bet your partner picked up on it also.  Maybe he didn't want his partner to be treated as a sex object by this couple.  you two are going to need to sit down and discuss this.  good luck to both of you.", "I really hope you're not referring to me, nothing I said was beratment. I did have choice words for your 'friends' tho", "Maybe not all the way racist but they're definitely fetishizing you in particular and Black women in general. I have never heard of a non swinger couple being visibly disappointed by not seeing a naked black woman because they've \"never seen one\". Very Ick", "they honestly sound pretty racist... not like confederate flag waving camo wearing hunting trumper racist... but like educated white and think they're better than others but they make an effort to the disadvantaged to include them sort of racist. \n\nit's a more subtle casual brand of racism but they 100% seem that way to me. \n\nand do you care about them as much as your husband? \n\n... why didn't you marry them instead of your husband then? \n\nwhy did you marry your husband at all if you love him the way you love your friends?", "You are welcome!", "You are welcome!", "You\u2019re on the express route to not having a husband anymore.\n\nFeeling sorry about it after doesn\u2019t change a rash decision that breaks your partners boundaries and trust. You didn\u2019t serve them naked because you thought it would be funny. You did it as an \u201cF you\u201d to your husband, without even telling him. Pretty toxic way to deal with conflict and honestly doesn\u2019t bold well for a long and happy relationship.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like how your partner has established his boundaries, that\u2019s very fair. But then address them to him instead of bottling it all up, snapping, and regretting whatever you did without thinking. \n\nDo you want to be married? Do you respect your husband? Do you want him to respect you? To trust you? Based on your comments you really need to think about yourself critically and what you want.", "Or don't tell him and he'll never find out. You didn't show him the picture like he asked", "appreciate that. i tried to say it as nicely as possible. but this post blew my mind.", "Tell your husband, its only right. Honestly though I cant see it working out in your favor. If he was already conservative about nudity, this will probably be cheating to him. Your values just might not line up  and the relationship has ran its course.", "I disagree. Because the husband threw that out at them and it felt like to me that the other couple and OP ran with it as a joke. Maybe I read that wrong, but it felt like HE made a big deal about it, and it was used against him by the other 3.", "Did you look at their Google history? Is this a pattern for them? You deduced that from one incident. If I was dating an AA person, yeah I'm going to say, ooh I've never dated an AA person before.", "We can't acknowledge peoples differences that make them special and unique anymore?", "It has nothing to do with being nude, it's the respect in a relationship. If your partner shows someone else their nude body and you didn't okay that, it's a blatant disrespect of the relationship.\nAlso, if that's how you feel, you can say that about anything. \"Who cares if I slept with someone else even if we're married!

If my partner doesn't agree then they aren't the right one for me", "He was uncomfortable but compromised for the photo shoot, then said no to having the photos in the house and showing people, then, upset by that answer : she striped for her friends who have already badgered to see her naked specifically because she's a minority.
