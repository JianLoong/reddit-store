He can either believe you and take it up with his cousin, or he can not believe you and be mad about it on his own time.\n\nIf it was that important it should have been dealt with long before this point.\n\nDead relationships are not storage units.", "NTA...  I can understand why he's upset, but he had two full years to come to you to get the ring back if it was that important.  You went above and beyond and even at least gave it to A family member, many others would have just sold or pawned it.\n\nYou made many efforts to contact him, which he ignored... so it's on him at this point. You are not responsible for keeping up with things that are important to him once the relationship is over.", "NTA. You left in the care of one of his family members, who told you he would give it back. Your ex never looked for it until he saw you at the wedding. Your job is done, the heirloom is back in the family. Any problems he has, he should take it up with his cousin. Wash your hands of them all.", "NTA. It was a family ring, you gave it to a family member. He had plenty of time to get it back from you, he didn't. Only way you would have been T.A. is if you didn't return it to the family. It's his cousin, tell him to get it back from them.", "NTA. He ignored your attempts to contact him. He played stupid games and won stupid prizes.

And it is not your responsibility to get it back off his family member and give it to him.

Tell him to take it up with his cousin.", "I think it's weird you didn't want to mail it \"because it might get lost\" but handed it over to a casual acquaintance and just assumed it would get back to him, but no, I would say NTA. Two years is enough time for him to ask you for the ring back if it meant so much to him. If he was seriously ignoring you when you tried to contact him then I'd say he really couldn't expect you to have held onto it for the minute chance he'd talk to you at a random event years later", "Two years is more than plenty enough time for ex to retrieve the ring himself, especially since you tried to do so but was ignored.

You were kind enough to give it back to his family member. That\u2019s between them now.", "NTA\n\nJust ghost this ahole", "NTA.  2 years he did nothing about it.\n\nTechnically an engagement ring doesn't belong to the receiver as it is a conditional gift - if the condition isn't met (i.e. a wedding) then it still belongs to whoever gave the ring, so it was technically still his.  \n\nYou probably shouldn't have given it to some random cousin, but for him to expect you would still have it after 2 years is a bit much.  You told him where it is, so he needs to go speak to his cousin about it.", "Nta, it was nice of you to have the intention of giving it back given that it was an heirloom. But technically a gift like an engagement ring is your property, and it was yours to give to the cousin, or whoever. His cousin might be an asshole but that\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA - if your ex wouldn't respond about it after your breakup it's not your job to hang onto anything for him. That was already nice of you to give it to the cousin instead of considering it yours.", "The ex probably wanted op to keep the ring so they had something to talk about.\n\nSome people enjoy their weird power trips; block and move on.", "Exactly. It's not your fault you unknowingly gave it to someone shifty. You made an honest effort to get in contact with him to give it back, and when that didn't pan out you made an honest effort to at least give it to someone in the family with the intent that it be given back. It's now on them to gang up on Cousin Shifty and find out what he did with it.", "Right, if he refused all contact and didn\u2019t ask for the ring back for almost 2 solid years\u2026..this ain\u2019t about the ring.\n\nA lot of people would have pawned it.", "It was his cousin.", "Why didn't his grandson retrieve the ring? He had two years to do it. OP even contacted him about it.", "He lives in a different country to me so I couldn't give it to him directly.", "Right. OP\u2019s casual acquaintance", "That's a different question, I'm not agreeing with the ex. But the grandfather is the only person who is out the cost and sentimental value of the ring, and his ownership should be addressed.", "Not a casual acquaintance to the family though.", "Absolutely. But who knows? Perhaps he lived far away, or it was in some way hugely inconvenient for OP to do so. But the first time she met a family member of his, she handed the ring over in good faith. Something that her ex, his family and even his grandfather never bothered to do.", "Correct. I was more commenting on how I thought it odd she\u2019d trust someone she doesn\u2019t know that well but wouldn\u2019t trust, say, registered mail", ">But who knows?\n\n\n\nThat's why I asked OP.", "I just dont think it's her responsibility. She tried and eventually succeeded in getting it back to the family. As far as I'm concerned that's more than anyone in the family tried to do. Job done.", "NTA. You're better than most people including me. If my ex wasn't responding to my attempts to give back a ring after that long I would have already sold it. He couldn't have wanted it back that badly if he took so long.", "2 years he had to get it back. NTA and block him and his family.", "NTA. Double so in fact because legally an engagement ring once given is Completely the property of the recipient no matter if a wedding actually takes place or not.", "*Dead relationships are not storage units.*\n\nI LOVE this", "Yup, this was the one thing he could use to \u201chave to contact you\u201d. You gave it to the cousin, no longer your problem. Block and move on", "NTA\n\nyou don't have it. Cousin must have stolen it.\n\nBlock them both and be done with it.", "Two years later? Screw him.", "NTA this seems like a family matter for a family that is not yours. Block!!", "Well, the cousin is also a grandchild to the grandfather. No reason to suspect he\u2019d screw over grandpa this way. Best way for ex to makes sure the ring goes to the rightful owner is probably to sic the extended family on the cousin for stealing, if he hasn\u2019t sold it.", "INFO: Did you hear from the ex or the grandfather that the ring wasn\u2019t returned? I smell bullshit on the ex\u2019s part", "that ring sounds like an attempt. of maintaining contact by him.. you gave plenty of time for him to. pick it up, id say its more than enough, even if the ring ends up in a trash can somewhere", "An ex of mine did this to me.  I gave him all his things back, and his gold class ring was on the top of the bag.  \n\nHe starts calling me about the ring, claiming I still had it.  I kept asking him if he checked the floor of his truck, as maybe the way he drove caused the ring to fall out of the bag.\n\nThree days later, he shows up at my house with the ring, and it is dented on one side.  He forces it on me and demands I fix it.  Then he calls from home to fight.  I figure out that yes, he found it on the floor, so he probably damaged it himself.\n\nBut he could not fight with me if he accepted responsibility for his own mistake.  \n\nHe called a second time, and I told him my father was taking over the situation.  My father was going to take the ring to a jewelry store to be repaired after work, and he would be dealing with him for the rest of the issue.  The ex slammed the phone down on me, and fifteen minutes later he was at our house pounding on the door, screaming that he wanted the ring back.  He beat the hell out of the door, causing dents and scratches.  I was too scared to open the door, but once he stepped away, I tossed the ring out and closed and locked it.\n\nOnce I passed the ring to my dad, the game was no longer fun, and like all cowards, he became terrified and panicked at the thought of having to face my father.\n\nI think abusers put a lot of energy into creating drama and conflict.  This particular ex's signature move was calling to start a horrific fight, and then he would hang up laughing once I was upset.  He used the fights as excuses to cheat or not participate in a holiday.  It took 18 months for me to get wise \n\nAbusers need drama and energy.  I see why redditors suggest grey rocking.", "I would never trust something like that to the mail. It's too valuable and registered mail isn't fool proof. OP returned it to a family member.", "NTA once given to you it was a gift you could have thrown it from a bridge and he couldn\u2019t do Jack tell him his family is his own business", "NTA. You owe this man nothing. Not your problem.", "NTA, you snooze you loose", "You are really bad at math.", "Or maybe he got a new girlfriend and he\u2019s planning on reusing the ring when he propose", "NTA. 2 years it's yours to do as you please. His cousin is family. It's his job to get the ring. After 2 years he is lucky you did not sell it. His laziness is not your problem.", "Nope. It wasn\u2019t important enough for him to reclaim it himself in a timely manner and you returned it to the family. Out of your hands. NTA.", "NTA", "He left it with you for over 2 years. I think at that point he's lost all right to expect it to be returned to him. NTA", "He is a clown. He abandoned the ring. End of story.", "Possible, but since he wants to get OP to talk to his cousin so OP can give the ring back to him instead of talking to his own cousin suggests (to me at least) that it's not about the ring but about having some sort of control over OP.", "Nta. Block him and move on.", "SOUNDS LIKE A FAMILY MATTER AND YOU ARE NOT FAMILY SO JUST WALK AWAY", "You put in a good faith effort to return it to him and he refused to respond to you, so you did what you could even though you didn't have to.
