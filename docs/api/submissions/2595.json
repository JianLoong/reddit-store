Block them and don't give them another thought for the rest of your life.", "NTA. You contacted him trying to give it back and he ignored you.

You could have kept it, or sold it, and still would not be TA. \n\nYou gave it back to a family member, the rest is on the cousin if he pocketed it or anything.", "NTA. He can go deal with his own damn family.", "NTA\n\nDoing the math, you waited 17 months to do anything with the ring without it being raised as an issue (2 years - 7 months). \n\nGiven the amount of time, and little concern he expressed for it, you would have been well within your right to sell it, not particularly responsible if you lost it, and downright generous to try and gently guide it back into his family's possession. \n\nAs far as expecting you to do anything else about it, he's SOL at this point. He can either believe you and take it up with his cousin, or he can not believe you and be mad about it on his own time.\n\nIf it was that important it should have been dealt with long before this point.\n\nDead relationships are not storage units.", "NTA...  I can understand why he's upset, but he had two full years to come to you to get the ring back if it was that important.  You went above and beyond and even at least gave it to A family member, many others would have just sold or pawned it.\n\nYou made many efforts to contact him, which he ignored... so it's on him at this point. You are not responsible for keeping up with things that are important to him once the relationship is over.", "NTA. You left in the care of one of his family members, who told you he would give it back. Your ex never looked for it until he saw you at the wedding. Your job is done, the heirloom is back in the family. Any problems he has, he should take it up with his cousin. Wash your hands of them all.", "NTA. It was a family ring, you gave it to a family member. He had plenty of time to get it back from you, he didn't. Only way you would have been T.A. is if you didn't return it to the family. It's his cousin, tell him to get it back from them.", "NTA. He ignored your attempts to contact him. He played stupid games and won stupid prizes. Tell him the ring is back to the family, and he can deal with his family himself and leave you alone since he couldn't be bothered to answer your messages for two years.", "NTA\n\nYour ex avoided contact with you for more than a year when you were trying to return the ring to him.   He can follow up with his cousin himself.", "NTA. Actually sounds like your ex deliberately left it with you just to have this fight, which is weird AF but that\u2019s how it sounds. And it is not your responsibility to get it back off his family member and give it to him. Honestly he\u2019s lucky you\u2019re a good hearted enough person to see it returned to his family at all, plenty of people would\u2019ve just sold it.", "NTA, you held onto it for so long. Tell him to take it up with his cousin.", "I think it's weird you didn't want to mail it \"because it might get lost\" but handed it over to a casual acquaintance and just assumed it would get back to him, but no, I would say NTA. Two years is enough time for him to ask you for the ring back if it meant so much to him. If he was seriously ignoring you when you tried to contact him then I'd say he really couldn't expect you to have held onto it for the minute chance he'd talk to you at a random event years later", "Two years is more than plenty enough time for ex to retrieve the ring himself, especially since you tried to do so but was ignored. It was courteous of you to give it to the cousin, thus returning it to the family, instead of selling or trashing it. It's no longer your responsibility, and ex can go suck it. **NTA**", "NTA. He has Teo years to recobery the ring, he dont doit nothing. Honestly, you wait to much time to doit something with It. Its his fault he dont have the ring.", "NTA", "INFO.

You were kind enough to give it back to his family member. That\u2019s between them now.", "NTA\n\nJust ghost this ahole", "NTA.  2 years he did nothing about it.\n\nTechnically an engagement ring doesn't belong to the receiver as it is a conditional gift - if the condition isn't met (i.e. a wedding) then it still belongs to whoever gave the ring, so it was technically still his.  \n\nYou probably shouldn't have given it to some random cousin, but for him to expect you would still have it after 2 years is a bit much.  You told him where it is, so he needs to go speak to his cousin about it.", "Nta, it was nice of you to have the intention of giving it back given that it was an heirloom. But technically a gift like an engagement ring is your property, and it was yours to give to the cousin, or whoever. His cousin might be an asshole but that\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA - if your ex wouldn't respond about it after your breakup it's not your job to hang onto anything for him. That was already nice of you to give it to the cousin instead of considering it yours.", "The ex probably wanted op to keep the ring so they had something to talk about.\n\nSome people enjoy their weird power trips; block and move on.", "Exactly. It's not your fault you unknowingly gave it to someone shifty. You made an honest effort to get in contact with him to give it back, and when that didn't pan out you made an honest effort to at least give it to someone in the family with the intent that it be given back. It's now on them to gang up on Cousin Shifty and find out what he did with it.", "Right, if he refused all contact and didn\u2019t ask for the ring back for almost 2 solid years\u2026..this ain\u2019t about the ring.\n\nA lot of people would have pawned it.", "It was his cousin.", "Why didn't his grandson retrieve the ring? He had two years to do it. OP even contacted him about it.", "He lives in a different country to me so I couldn't give it to him directly.", "Right. OP\u2019s casual acquaintance", "That's a different question, I'm not agreeing with the ex. But the grandfather is the only person who is out the cost and sentimental value of the ring, and his ownership should be addressed.", "Not a casual acquaintance to the family though.", "Absolutely. But who knows? Perhaps he lived far away, or it was in some way hugely inconvenient for OP to do so. But the first time she met a family member of his, she handed the ring over in good faith. Something that her ex, his family and even his grandfather never bothered to do.", "Correct. I was more commenting on how I thought it odd she\u2019d trust someone she doesn\u2019t know that well but wouldn\u2019t trust, say, registered mail", ">But who knows?\n\n\n\nThat's why I asked OP.", "I just dont think it's her responsibility. She tried and eventually succeeded in getting it back to the family. As far as I'm concerned that's more than anyone in the family tried to do. Job done.", "NTA. You're better than most people including me. If my ex wasn't responding to my attempts to give back a ring after that long I would have already sold it. He couldn't have wanted it back that badly if he took so long.", "2 years he had to get it back. NTA and block him and his family.", "NTA. Double so in fact because legally an engagement ring once given is Completely the property of the recipient no matter if a wedding actually takes place or not.", "*Dead relationships are not storage units.*\n\nI LOVE this", "Yup, this was the one thing he could use to \u201chave to contact you\u201d.
