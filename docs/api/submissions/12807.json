However, I have made it a point to not correct her makeup as she learns how to do it herself unless she asks me for advice.

NTA. And you're right, learning makeup is a process just like anything else. It comes with practice and mistakes. If it's in your means, and she's interested, I bet a consult at a makeup counter to learn some basics with a professional would be a big hit.", "NTA, I generally agree with you.  But ask your daughter.  Ask her how much she'd like for you to involve yourself?  Don't tell her she's made mistakes, just let her know that if she wants your opinion, she's always welcome to ask for it.\n\nOh, and if she does make a terrible mistake, I hope you'll find a gentle way to point it out to her.  I always appreciate when people find a way to tell me that my tie is messed up, or worse, that I forgot to zip up...", "NTA. I had a mom like her and it\u2019s awful for your self esteem. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to wear makeup?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s normal for girls your age to care about how they look.\u201d  \nI honestly can\u2019t believe she said that to you! My sisters and I all still struggle with body image issues, self esteem issues and negative self talk. And if I\u2019m being honest, negative initial impressions for a variety of crappy arbitrary reasons. I have to talk myself back after I do it and I\u2019m in my mid-30s. It\u2019s hard to unlearn that negativity", "NAH When my daughter was young, I took her to a professional to have her make up done and they also color match foundation and explain how to apply make up for certain looks, and go over what colors work best etc. She has actually gone to more than one. One was free with the purchase of a foundation. The other was paid for at Ulta.\n\nThere are also cosmetology schools who offer this service pretty cheap. It is worth doing. They get pampered, get expert knowledge and the undivided attention of the makeup artist. I believe some department stores do this also. My daughter loved it. Many young girls have their makeup professionally done for homecoming or prom too. Check around and get recommendations. The makeup artist for my nieces wedding was amazing. She did my daughters also and I have never seen her look so good. Some professionals are ok, and some are phenomenal.\n\nETA: I would approach this as a treat. Pampering, not that she is not good at it.", "NTA. This is how kids learn. If your daughter wanted your help, she would ask for it. She obviously is proud of the fact that she is figuring this out for herself. \n\nThe other mother doesn\u2019t need to be sticking her nose into this.", "NTA\n\n> it wasn't perfect, but she was proud.\n\nHonestly, that's what matters.\n\nMy mom didn't teach me... well, anything really, but definitely not how to do makeup. And I wish she had. That someone had. I struggled a lot, well into adulthood.\n\nThere's a wide gulf between nagging a child about how they need to look perfect vs... nitpicking technique... vs... teaching *basic* skills.\n\nI think it's really important to stress for your kids that they don't *need* makeup, but also to teach really basic skills. I think it's important to let your kids know that you're there if they have questions, or need help learning how to do something new. And to *then* let them experiment on their own.\n\nMuch like anything else you're teaching a child. I showed my kiddo how to do laundry: This  is how much you put in the machine, this is how you sort the clothes, measure detergent, operate a machine. Here's how to fold the clothes. \n\nAnd then let them do it even if they do it \"wrong\". But sometimes my kid comes with a fitted sheet, \"Mom how do you do the corners again?\"\n\nMakeup is just like any other skill. \n\nI can't tell how much you *are* teaching your daughter, or how much help she *wants* from your post.\n\nBut like...\n\n>Her friends mom asked my why I hadn't steered my daughter in the right direction when it came to makeup and correct her when her eyeliner is uneven or she wears too much mascara.\n\nThat seems a bit much. Much more like what you described about someone breathing down your neck.\n\nI think her friend's mom is probably pretty overbearing. And if that's what she was complaining about, I bet your daughter is doing just fine. So... yeah, you're not the AH.", "NAH. You and the best friend's mom both had your daughter's best interests in mind.\n\nBut as someone who had embarrassingly bad makeup in my teens, with photos to show for it... I would have appreciated it if my mom had taught me. \n\nMaybe you can invite your daughter to a spa day, shop for makeup, and then take a makeup lesson together? That way it would be a fun bonding experience instead of something awkward.", "Looking back to when I was 15, I really wish my mom had helped me more with my makeup and hair. I look at my old photos and am a bit embarrassed at my younger self. She would have had to be very diplomatic with me as I was not an easy teen but I wish she had tried in some way.", "NTA her opinion sucks and she should've kept it to herself", "NTA!!\n\nThe only advice regarding makeup that a 15 year old girl needs is that she is beautiful without it.\n\nLet her know that you\u2019re there for her for any and all advice in any capacity and you\u2019ll be doing better than any of the moms whose teens have perfect eyeliner. It can be a bonding thing if you treat it right but please never criticize a girl\u2019s makeup like that other mom did.", "I love that you don\u2019t want to discourage her, and your approach to empowering her confidence is fabulous.\n\nMy mom did not \u201ccorrect\u201d my first attempts to use makeup, and I looked horrible. I would have loved her to help me get better. A roommate finally told me my makeup didn\u2019t match my skin in college and helped me. That\u2019s a lot of milestones with crappy makeup.\n\nMaybe you can ask her if she\u2019d like your help. Make it fun - suggest you two go learn how together from a make up artist. Girls\u2019 day!\n\nIt\u2019s okay to be honest with your daughter. I know know my mom will now tell me the truth about things others won\u2019t - bad haircut\u2026 Bad outfit. I am thankful for it. It means the compliments are more meaningful because they are never fake.\n\nNAH. Your intentions are good! Just offering another perspective\u2026that perhaps by not \u201ccorrecting\u201d her it could hurt her in the long run.", "NTA. I had a mom who did the exact same thing that you did when I started to wear makeup. Eventually we all figured out a way to put on makeup that worked for us. The only time I ever remember my mom interfering was if the style of makeup I wore was inappropriate for the event. For example having a heavy smokey eye for school in the morning. \n\nIf your daughter is interested in makeup it\u2019s also a great way to make an experience together. I know sephora for example offers makeup tutorials where you can book an appointment and they can show you how to do a natural makeup look on yourself and show you how to colour match and apply makeup according to your personal features. I\u2019m not sure but I do believe they make you purchase any of the makeup they use on you but it\u2019s a cute birthday gift idea and it\u2019s also something she\u2019ll remember. And it\u2019s a way to avoid having to tell her  the way she\u2019s currently doing her makeup looks off. (I also went through an awkward eye liner phase myself and my mom never told me it looked bad and we just laugh at the pictures now)", "NTA. Think of it this way:\n\nIf you tell her it looks bad, worst case scenario you hurt your teenage daughter's feelings and make her feel more insecure, and possibly harm your relationship with her.\n\nIf you don't tell her, worst case scenario she looks back on photos in 10 years and is like \"damn mom, why didn't you tell me I looked like a raccoon?\" and you laugh about it.\n\nSpeaking from experience. I had a huge makeup phase in my teens. I'm talking like bright orange eyeshadow on one eye and bright blue on the other. I thought I was going to be in vouge or something lol. My mom let me do my thing and we laugh at it together now.\n\nAlso, how miserable does a grown woman have to be to hate on a teen girl's makeup? that woman needs a hobby.", "NTA but I do remember my mum offering to get me \"make up lessons\" when I was 12 or 13 from a professional who came to our house as a birthday present. That could be an option that she might enjoy if you are concerned about her being embarrassed.", "Although your motives seem good, many mothers find makeup to be a bonding exercise with their daughters. Perhaps try that instead of tapping out. You may be surprised by the results. \n\nNAH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My daughter was the typical emo \ud83d\udda4 child for a few of her teenage years and she asked me a few times to help her with eyeliner but if I had offered my own opinion she would have shut it down. Later she came to me expressing a desire to learn more but just not from me for a little bit because teenagers and moms can be stressful right. Well ego hit right in the chest because I got paid to do this very thing but thankfully I put that aside for private time and booked her an appointment with a friend at Ulta for a full day of facial and then face. She was tutored on personal face care and then shown how to pick color palette\u2019s and different styles. All things I did professionally but she had an amazing day and gained confidence in herself and her choices that day and mom cried in her wine a little bit. After that she started coming to me for tips and advice and still gets a weekly facial and massage from me, was a massage therapist as well, and she is 20 so we bond. But the thing is, she was self conscious and is very much a perfectionist and was 16 so wanted independence and taking criticism or a critique from someone who is not mom is different at that age. I am glad I put my own personal feeling aside and considered hers first and for me it worked out. So as a former professional \ud83d\ude02I would recommend a full facial and makeup experience at Ulta or someplace similar if you can afford it because skin care is so important and she will feel so grown up at the same time and mom will be the heroine not someone who gives unsolicited advise or perceived criticism even if it was not meant that way.", "NTA I can't even imagine being the kind of person who would confront another parent over a child's makeup. I don't even have the words.", "NTA. I envy your ability to practice that already. Not offering my unsolicited opinion to my teens is something I have had to learn to do and something that can still be hard for me to practice.\n\nDon't worry about that other mom. That's just her opinion. I get the feeling she doesn't spend much time giving any thought to the notion of NOT offering her unsolicited opinion to her daughter, the neighbor, or you!", "NTA, I\u2019ve never worn makeup but many of my friends who did, were horrible at the begging and got better over time. it\u2019s an art and a form of self expression and if she\u2019s proud, hell yeah, rock it", "NTA if she has a fragile ego you should absolutely not be the one to correct her. Buy her some decent quality makeup for her next birthday or holiday along with makeup lessons and let them teach and correct her", "That is a great birthday present idea. Thanks!", "She is a very independent teenager with a very fragile ego (for lack of a better word). I will point out if she has a smudge on her cheek as that'd easily fixable, or if she rubbed her eye and ruined that whole side. If I insinuated she looked \"bad\" in any way she would get upset so I have chosen to not make unsolicited remarks.\n\nShe has asked me for my input in the past and as it's never jaw droppingly bad I will tell her she looks nice/did a good job as I know that she wants to be told she looks nice. But if she asked if her eyeliner was even, I'd let her know. She has come to me for specific advice and I've given it the best I can or try to find a reference for her.", "One person suggested a stop at the makeup counter. I think that I might incorporate that into her sweet 16th. Thanks for the suggestion!", "I tell my daughter she's beautiful every day, but she still gives me a heart attack with her winged eyeliner skills.", "That is exactly my thought. Especially how our brains distort memories over time.\n\nMe telling her \"your eyeliner is a bit uneven, fix your right eye.\" translates into \"mom thinks I'm bad at makeup and also ugly\" which in 10 years will live in her memory as the time mom said her eyeliner looked bad, even if the reality is that I told her to look twice at her makeup. Maybe a bit dramatic but I would rather my daughter laugh at pictures in ten years than be scared of asking me for advice and remember that I nitpicked and criticized her makeup.", "I think maybe I downplayed my \"involvement\" in her makeup. If I see she tries something new, I'll tell her she looks nice. She has come to me for help if she gets frustrated in the past. I let her borrow my makeup as long as she returns it in a nice condition. \n\nI'm not all that \"into\" makeup (i've been wearing the same boring look since I was in my 20s) so I'm not all that much help to her.", "I learned how to do makeup in my 20s at MAC.

Ignore the others who think they know better.", "When my daughter started wearing makeup I took her to MAC, Sephora, Clinique & Dior to get makeovers together. It gave us a chance to hang out & we both learned a lot. When I scheduled the appointments I made sure to tell them that it was for a new user. Everyone was very helpful & took their time with her. She got to ask all her questions & decide what she liked. I was able to purchase items that I knew worked for her skin tone & she knew how to use them. This way I didn\u2019t waste money on random items. She ended up with a full makeup kit with items she loved. Maybe your daughter would enjoy a makeover. It also gave us a few days to hang out & talk.", "NTA at all.
