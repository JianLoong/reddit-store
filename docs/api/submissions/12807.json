But ask your daughter.  Ask her how much she'd like for you to involve yourself?  Don't tell her she's made mistakes, just let her know that if she wants your opinion, she's always welcome to ask for it.\n\nOh, and if she does make a terrible mistake, I hope you'll find a gentle way to point it out to her.

My sisters and I all still struggle with body image issues, self esteem issues and negative self talk. And if I\u2019m being honest, negative initial impressions for a variety of crappy arbitrary reasons. I have to talk myself back after I do it and I\u2019m in my mid-30s. It\u2019s hard to unlearn that negativity", "NAH When my daughter was young, I took her to a professional to have her make up done and they also color match foundation and explain how to apply make up for certain looks, and go over what colors work best etc. She has actually gone to more than one. One was free with the purchase of a foundation. The other was paid for at Ulta.\n\nThere are also cosmetology schools who offer this service pretty cheap. It is worth doing. They get pampered, get expert knowledge and the undivided attention of the makeup artist. I believe some department stores do this also. My daughter loved it. Many young girls have their makeup professionally done for homecoming or prom too. Check around and get recommendations. The makeup artist for my nieces wedding was amazing. She did my daughters also and I have never seen her look so good. Some professionals are ok, and some are phenomenal.\n\nETA: I would approach this as a treat.

And I wish she had. That someone had. I struggled a lot, well into adulthood.\n\nThere's a wide gulf between nagging a child about how they need to look perfect vs... nitpicking technique... vs... teaching *basic* skills.\n\nI think it's really important to stress for your kids that they don't *need* makeup, but also to teach really basic skills. I think it's important to let your kids know that you're there if they have questions, or need help learning how to do something new. And to *then* let them experiment on their own.\n\nMuch like anything else you're teaching a child. I showed my kiddo how to do laundry: This  is how much you put in the machine, this is how you sort the clothes, measure detergent, operate a machine. Here's how to fold the clothes. \n\nAnd then let them do it even if they do it \"wrong\". But sometimes my kid comes with a fitted sheet, \"Mom how do you do the corners again?\"\n\nMakeup is just like any other skill. \n\nI can't tell how much you *are* teaching your daughter, or how much help she *wants* from your post.\n\nBut like...\n\n>Her friends mom asked my why I hadn't steered my daughter in the right direction when it came to makeup and correct her when her eyeliner is uneven or she wears too much mascara.\n\nThat seems a bit much.

You and the best friend's mom both had your daughter's best interests in mind.\n\nBut as someone who had embarrassingly bad makeup in my teens, with photos to show for it... I would have appreciated it if my mom had taught me. \n\nMaybe you can invite your daughter to a spa day, shop for makeup, and then take a makeup lesson together? That way it would be a fun bonding experience instead of something awkward.", "Looking back to when I was 15, I really wish my mom had helped me more with my makeup and hair.

It can be a bonding thing if you treat it right but please never criticize a girl\u2019s makeup like that other mom did.", "I love that you don\u2019t want to discourage her, and your approach to empowering her confidence is fabulous.\n\nMy mom did not \u201ccorrect\u201d my first attempts to use makeup, and I looked horrible. I would have loved her to help me get better. A roommate finally told me my makeup didn\u2019t match my skin in college and helped me.

Just offering another perspective\u2026that perhaps by not \u201ccorrecting\u201d her it could hurt her in the long run.", "NTA. I had a mom who did the exact same thing that you did when I started to wear makeup. Eventually we all figured out a way to put on makeup that worked for us. The only time I ever remember my mom interfering was if the style of makeup I wore was inappropriate for the event. For example having a heavy smokey eye for school in the morning. \n\nIf your daughter is interested in makeup it\u2019s also a great way to make an experience together. I know sephora for example offers makeup tutorials where you can book an appointment and they can show you how to do a natural makeup look on yourself and show you how to colour match and apply makeup according to your personal features. I\u2019m not sure but I do believe they make you purchase any of the makeup they use on you but it\u2019s a cute birthday gift idea and it\u2019s also something she\u2019ll remember. And it\u2019s a way to avoid having to tell her  the way she\u2019s currently doing her makeup looks off. (I also went through an awkward eye liner phase myself and my mom never told me it looked bad and we just laugh at the pictures now)", "NTA. Think of it this way:\n\nIf you tell her it looks bad, worst case scenario you hurt your teenage daughter's feelings and make her feel more insecure, and possibly harm your relationship with her.\n\nIf you don't tell her, worst case scenario she looks back on photos in 10 years and is like \"damn mom, why didn't you tell me I looked like a raccoon?\" and you laugh about it.\n\nSpeaking from experience. I had a huge makeup phase in my teens. I'm talking like bright orange eyeshadow on one eye and bright blue on the other. I thought I was going to be in vouge or something lol. My mom let me do my thing and we laugh at it together now.\n\nAlso, how miserable does a grown woman have to be to hate on a teen girl's makeup? that woman needs a hobby.", "NTA but I do remember my mum offering to get me \"make up lessons\" when I was 12 or 13 from a professional who came to our house as a birthday present. That could be an option that she might enjoy if you are concerned about her being embarrassed.", "Although your motives seem good, many mothers find makeup to be a bonding exercise with their daughters.

My daughter was the typical emo \ud83d\udda4 child for a few of her teenage years and she asked me a few times to help her with eyeliner but if I had offered my own opinion she would have shut it down. Later she came to me expressing a desire to learn more but just not from me for a little bit because teenagers and moms can be stressful right. Well ego hit right in the chest because I got paid to do this very thing but thankfully I put that aside for private time and booked her an appointment with a friend at Ulta for a full day of facial and then face. She was tutored on personal face care and then shown how to pick color palette\u2019s and different styles. All things I did professionally but she had an amazing day and gained confidence in herself and her choices that day and mom cried in her wine a little bit. After that she started coming to me for tips and advice and still gets a weekly facial and massage from me, was a massage therapist as well, and she is 20 so we bond. But the thing is, she was self conscious and is very much a perfectionist and was 16 so wanted independence and taking criticism or a critique from someone who is not mom is different at that age. I am glad I put my own personal feeling aside and considered hers first and for me it worked out. So as a former professional \ud83d\ude02I would recommend a full facial and makeup experience at Ulta or someplace similar if you can afford it because skin care is so important and she will feel so grown up at the same time and mom will be the heroine not someone who gives unsolicited advise or perceived criticism even if it was not meant that way.", "NTA I can't even imagine being the kind of person who would confront another parent over a child's makeup.

Thanks!", "She is a very independent teenager with a very fragile ego (for lack of a better word).

Cost me a good amount for the products cos it was a high end brand but I don\u2019t wear makeup a massive amount so it was worth it", "Yeah\u2026I\u2019m pushing 50 and would love to learn some makeup basics because my makeup knowledge is stuck back in 1995.", "Right?! I was super grunge so the closest I got was cringy The Crow-style makeup. I still have pictures, so I can relive my shame whenever I want. Yaaaaaaaay.", "I mean, if she was going out looking like a streetwalking clown that's one thing  but imperfect makeup? Teens probably won't even really notice.\n\nNTA - imo teens work better when allowed to be imperfect and allowed to ask for help rather than it be forced upon them. I'm not a parent but I am a decade older than the oldest of my brothers so I have a fair amount experience being the \"'wise' elder brother\"", "NTA she was proud of herself and you didn\u2019t finish that by telling her she could do better. My daughter is in the same boat and yes sometimes it doesn\u2019t look great she\u2019s trying and learning as she goes and that\u2019s what counts. At the end of the day her best friends mam has shown she\u2019s superficial - she cares more about what her child looks like rather than their emotional growth. \n\nI know a lot of MUA\u2019s will do session where they teach people how to do makeup on their face and do little mini makeovers, so it might be something worth looking into incase the other mam says anything.", "NTA. You sound like a great parent. The friend\u2019s mum should be taking notes from you, not the other way around.", "NAH. But ask your daughter if she would like tips and tricks you e learned over the years. \n\nI never would have asked my mum for makeup help - she didn\u2019t wear any. Her youngest sister however? Taught me how to apply everything. These days I use neutrals, it was the 80s when I learned so it was all big bold blues, greens and pinks", "\n>but her friends mom said I was letting my daughter embarrass herself. \n\nShe's 15. Her main job is embarrassing herself and then blaming you for embarrassing her.\n\nSeriously though. It's an awkward age. It is for everyone.\nI agree with your approach. NTA", "NTA \n\nLook I know plenty of women my age (39) who still can\u2019t do a neat sharp wing despite many attempts \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02 it took me a longggggg time to perfect it and I was in my early 30s when trying . The fact your daughter isn\u2019t \u2018great\u2019 at Doing it right now is absolutely irrelevant and the woman sounds like a knob tbh \ud83d\ude05", "NTA at all, but if you're worried maybe you could find some time to talk with your daughter and ask her if she wants your input or advice. Just offer it helpfully and take no for an answer if that's what she says (sounds like you would definitely take her no, which is good) That way you've offered and can have a guilt free conscience, and your daughter knows there's an open invitation if she ever decides she does want advice or tips. Plus bonding time.", "Ask your daughter what she would like you to do.", "When both my daughters were 15 I took them for a professional make up lesson, they were shown how to do the basics well and they both went on from there worth every penny", "NTA \n\nShe was proud of herself, and it's a good practice not to offer an opinion unless asked.", "NTA!\nShe was proud. Let her be happy with what she is proud of. It would do nothing but make her feel bad about herself to say it looks bad. That's why I don't show what I'm proud of anymore. Too many people close to me judging.", "NTA. I have been wearing makeup since I was 12 and I\u2019ve looked admittedly botched quite a few times. I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world though because that\u2019s decades of screw ups that have my makeup looking good as an adult. What is with people and this perfectionist ideal? Makeup is supposed to be fun man.", "Seriously. So many people look back at their first adventures into make up and realize what they thought was a cool look at the time turns out in retrospect to be so much eyeshadow they look like someone gave them a black eye. \n\nLet her experiment and learn!", "I would also say that you could find a local HMUA to talk to for a lesson! They're generally pretty personable and I know that my friend offers all kinds of helpful lessons. Also, NTA.", "You just unlocked a memory of my mom doing this for me as a birthday gift when I was around OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s age! We got our nails done, went to Ulta and I got a makeover with a consultant and a few products, and we went to lunch. It was such a fun day and great quality time with my mom. Definitely recommend!", "Winged liner is pretty difficult to do. OP pointing it out isn't going to help anything if you don't have the practice or dexterity. Winged liner took me years to perfect on myself. If her daughter was proud, why rain on her parade. \n\nBeing a teenager was filled with embarrassing stuff, it's just part of the experience.", "Honestly, it really sounds like the thing you need to help your daughter work on is not her make up, but how to take criticism in a healthy and productive way.", "You know your daughter best. You offer encouragement and support without criticism. Great job, ignore the overbearing mom", "Heck I'd be all over that *now*.  I never got into.make up as a teen and now I have no clue how to even start.", "I was going to ask the same thing.  I'd like to say that I used to be pretty good at it, but since wfh for 3 years and barely putting on clothes daily, I have lost all of my skills.  I'm afraid to do more than mascara nowadays because I think I'll look like Tammy Faye!", "Are you me??? Lots of black liquid eyeliner got used on the weekends at my house. \n\nThat said, you can pry my Clinique Black Honey lipstick from my cold, dead hands.", "This reminds me of the time when my younger daughter applied makeup at a friend's house. You could clearly tell it was her first try at makeup. \n\nWe were staying at my mother's home at the time. When she came home, my mother told her she looked like a whore. \n\nI told Mama don't call her that; there are call girls who know how to put on makeup. (I was so angry.) I then told my daughter to wash that crap off her face and I'd show her how to put on makeup. Enhance, not mask, is what I taught her.\n\n A little help without the neck breathing wouldn't have hurt. YTA.", "NTS the friends mom should mind her own business.", "You're NTA... and frankly I still wouldn't bring it up to her, despite the best friend's mom's weird overinvolvement in your kid's makeup.  If the kid looks like she fell face-first into a Sephora then that's up to her.  She'll figure it out in time and in the interim there's no need to shame her.", "NTA.\n\nI helped teach my bfs daughter, then just 12, some eyeliner techniques. Her first few attempts weren't super great, but she was so damn proud, she sent me pics. There was no way on Earth I'd have said anything remotely negative about it. I was just so happy she'd asked me and was trying.\n\n2 years later, she does it better than me and I'm the cat eye eyeliner QUEEN! lol!", "NTA. This was close to  N A H but the other mom overstepped with her comment about letting your daughter embarrass herself, and skewed it in your favor. \n\nIt's all about delivery. I don't think any of us ever want anyone we care about to look silly, but if anything ever does actually look *bad* there's a way to gently help her adjust.", "NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re right most girls don\u2019t want advice from their mom. I didn\u2019t go to my mom because she never tried to wear it so she had no clue. By 14 I figured it out myself any way. My youngest daughter has asked me for advice. She hates wearing makeup but she does for VERY SPECIAL  reasons for OTHERS not herself. Like last summer she was Maid Of Honor for her best friend so she did it to have nice pics for the wedding. I really don\u2019t think her friend would have cared because she knows my daughter hates makeup. I don\u2019t think she will be for her own wedding. So you\u2019re really not wrong. Kids generally don\u2019t want their mother\u2019s advice on very much stuff.", "OP is doing a GREAT job with her daughter!  Just needs to tell the other mother, \"not your circus, not your monkeys.  Now get on your broomstick and fly home.\"", "Or get her a professional make up eg for her birthday and ask whoever is doing the make up to explain what they're doing if it's possible, maybe ask in advance (I had pro make up done twice but I was embarrassed to ask tbh, I looked like a bomb both times and I'm very average looking). This will also show her what looks good on her and how to do contour for her face shape. Also important to pick the right shade of foundation (warm or cool), I mean she probably knows about this since this is basic stuff that even I know about and I barely do make up. Stuff like eyeliner or blending she will eventually learn on her own, it's not everyone is born knowing how to do it perfectly.\n\nHonestly the audacity of this women is astonishing.", "My mom did this for me with a focus on skin care. I had a great time, felt fancy with my new skin care and make up, and I learned how to use it.", "My mom did this with me and we made a day of it. First we went and got our makeup done with a great mua, then lunch and then a movie. It was over 40 years ago and it\u2019s still one of my favorite memories. I also did it with my daughter and had a wonderful day", "Yeah, I think this is perfect. You\u2019re meeting her where she is and being respectful. \n\nNTA", "You should definitely do it. Your never too old for that. I would but I can\u2019t afford it and I have been doing my makeup for YEARS. I definitely would still love the beauty consultant even the $75 class they give!", "I never really wore make up and I have been looking up beginner make up tutorials on youtube.  I am 52.", "Any recommendations? I don\u2019t even know where to start.", "Black honey is so on trend (again)! I just bought one and the page on Clinique has a big badge saying how it\u2019s popular on TikTok.", "I don't have anyone I follow.  I was looking for eye shadow tutorials so I just did a search for beginner eye shadow and started watching different ones.  They also have beginner make up tutorials for older women.  I would just recommend searching for what you are interested in and then watching a variety of videos.  If you find someone you like, you can search their videos for specific products.  Most will do tutorials recommending drug store brands and also higher end brands so depending on your budget you can get some good recommendations."]}
