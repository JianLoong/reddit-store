An epic turnaround would be if you looked him dead in the eye and asked him who he knocked up lololololol", "NTA. Ask the hubs \"Where's the joke?\"", "Isn't that his brother's wife news to share?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour husband is the A.  You're in the clear.", "I had an issue with my stomach once which made me gas up like crazy. I looked like 7th month pregnant and didn't fit in any pants of mine. I joked with my bestie about it and thus took pictures of my belly in those \"typical\" poses. On April's fool I decided to use one of those pictures for a prank. I never claimed I'd be pregnant, but my status said something between the lines of \"can't wait to get rid of that belly again  \ud83e\udd70\u2764\ufe0f\". \n\nNot all friends fell for it, but those who did were goddamn hilarious! We're all joking about this until today.", "Not his brother. OP's brother.", "His SIL has no relation to his mom. It's his wife's bother's wife, or his mom's daughter-in-law's brother's wife. It's very likely that it's pretty much on OP or him to tell his mom that they're gonna have a new nephew/niece on the other side of the family.", "It isn't *his* brother.", "NTA\n\nIf he pulls another joke like that just say, \"Yup and we're getting a divorce.\"", "NTA. Ugh. How unoriginal and unfunny.", "NTA\nI agree with you OP\nThis is not even funny.", "NTA, and INFO, it sounds like his mother really wants more grandchildren, why would he be so cruel as to torment her like that? At least you spoiled it quickly, hopefully before she became too excited over it.", "NTA", "NTA his mother yes ur body/ur included in that gross \u2018joke\u2019 so what\u2019s b he thinking", "My only pregnancy joke is super inappropriate. So I\u2019m gonna say it. \n\nI tell people if I get pregnant I\u2019m throwing myself down the stairs, and if it survives I\u2019m keeping it because it\u2019s already a winner\u2026. jk, I would never actually throw myself down the stairs. \n\nThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s about me and me alone, in the face of people that tell me that I will eventually change my mind about having kids.  No one else is on the receiving end of that joke.", "Telling someone they should fear their husband( whom they have a child with) violating their consent because of the incredibly big jump from inappropriate joke involving pregnancy, to trying to impregnate you against your will is a big Reddit moment", "I wish i had an award to give you, but all i can do is tell you i wish i had an award to give you.", "what joke... she would've just been mad lol", "Jokes of this nature are rarely funny and often cause more hardships than hahas. NTA. Did you and your husband get a pet recently? This is like one for one how my aunt introduced her dog to my grandpa lol", "NTA. Pregnancy jokes not funny we have been saying this forever.", "Why tf is HE announcing someone else's pregnancy anyways? How fkn rude. You're NTA, but he is for at least two reasons: pregnancy \"jokes\" are pretty much never funny or appropriate, and you don't just announce someone else's pregnancy.", "NTA in any form, dashing someone's joy or hope is horrible, placing that joy and hope in a person with the clear intent to dash it is just cruel. Your husband needs to get a joke book and study it because the ones he seems to be making are not funny.", "NTA. weird husband", "NTA definitely", "NTA - your husband was acting like a jerk", "tell him at some point \n\n\"guess who is becoming father again?\" and watch his reaction\n\nNTA", "It's reddit.  Everything is a red flag and everyone is the worst abuser ever to walk the earth.  People can't just be assholes.", "nope, she should just start screaming : I can't believe you cheated on me. Who do you got pregnant."]}
