You did the right thing.", "NTA and have to say that\u2019s a pretty cruel joke to play on grandma and you", "NTA.\n\nWhat's the punchline?", "NTA. Oh there are some things you don\u2019t joke about. This is one.", "NTA\n\nPretty cut and dry. You truthfully commented on his statement to avoid any assumptions.", "NTA. my aunt used to do april fools jokes about *me* getting pregnant. (dunno why me specifically, i think because unlike my other cousins, i am less open about my partners) and this pissed off my mom endlessly. she used to work for the police dept and said such jokes can get people killed.\n\nnow obviously thats an extreme for your situation, but still doesnt take away how shitty such a joke is. plus you dont wanna get accused of having an abortion/miscarriage when its revealed you're not pregnant", "NTA. That\u2019s not a joke. What\u2019s funny about that ?", "NTA\n\nThat's a mean spirited \"joke\" he was trying to spring on his mom. I'm with you, you don't joke about being pregnant.", "NTA.  I don't see a problem with joking about pregnancy in general when all parties are on board (though getting his mom's hopes up as a joke is a dick move), but you were never consulted about it. He was dragging you into a joke you didn't want to be a part of. You have every right to bail out of it.  She may be his mom, but you're your you.\n\nPersonally, I can't stand it when people try to drag me into their jokes or lies, or try to speak for me.  It's disrespectful.", "NTA. You were in the right to put a stop to that before anything else was said. Your husband's joke brought you into it and without any warning or consent. Pregnancy isn't supposed to be a joke. He should know better than that.", "Huh? So who\u2019s going to be a grandma again?", "NTA\n\nHIS \"joke\" centered around YOU being pregnant.

And I use the work joking *very* lightly here because nothing about that sounds even remotely funny", "NTA I'm actually quite confused however.\n\nHow is this a joke? Jokes are supposed to be funny.

You saved the dumbass.", "It\u2019s not his place to make the announcement!  Let the parents-to-be share the news.", "Well half of what grows in her uterus would be his. So he'll just prank about his half.", "That\u2019s how I felt about it too, until he accuses me of stepping on his joke.", "No, our families are not particularly close. I\u2019m not sure why he felt the need to tell her that way. I probably would have told her eventually that my sister-in-law was pregnant again, but it wouldn\u2019t have been a huge announcement. More of a \u201coh, my brother and his wife are expecting again.\u201d", "He didn\u2019t tell my mom, he told his.

You've got it now.", "INFO: Is your husband regularly cruel and insensitive to other people's feelings for his amusement?

You're NTA, because there was no joke to step on.", "NTA. Pregnancy jokes are not funny. I\u2019m fortunate enough to have never experienced infertility/loss but I know that many MANY people have. It\u2019s not fucking funny to pull an April Fools type gotcha joke about it", "So after reading some comments It appears his joke was \"Guess who's going to be a grandma again? Not you!\" WTF???? Who does that to their own mother? Of course you're NTA that wasn't funny in the least! It was a cruel prank at best and you were right to step in immediately!", "NTA back when my husband and I were dating he made a joke about getting me pregnant and I sat him down and had to explain to him why it was not funny to me. We are now in a position where if a baby does happen we won't panic, but we're not actively trying to get pregnant.", "NTA\n\nIf he really wants to pursue this kind of unfunny bs, he can claim he got one (or more) of his side chicks pregnant.", "NTA.

NTA", "I\u2019m agreeing OP\u2019s partner is TA, and the joke was terribly inappropriate, but I imagine it was the setup to a punchline that never got to be delivered, and that\u2019s why it would\u2019ve been a joke.

What\u2019s funny about that", "It's not his brother, it's hers. So the answer to \"who's going to be a grandma again\" was her mother, who wasn't even present. \n\nJust weird all around.", "Yeah that was confusing. I wonder if this is husband\u2019s less than subtle dig at his wife that they don\u2019t have kids. Mocking her essentially to his own mother because he\u2019s a coward to say anything directly."]}
