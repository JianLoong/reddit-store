You did the right thing.", "NTA and have to say that\u2019s a pretty cruel joke to play on grandma and you", "NTA.\n\nWhat's the punchline?", "NTA. Oh there are some things you don\u2019t joke about. This is one.", "NTA\n\nPretty cut and dry. You truthfully commented on his statement to avoid any assumptions.", "NTA. my aunt used to do april fools jokes about *me* getting pregnant. (dunno why me specifically, i think because unlike my other cousins, i am less open about my partners) and this pissed off my mom endlessly. she used to work for the police dept and said such jokes can get people killed.\n\nnow obviously thats an extreme for your situation, but still doesnt take away how shitty such a joke is. plus you dont wanna get accused of having an abortion/miscarriage when its revealed you're not pregnant", "NTA. That\u2019s not a joke. What\u2019s funny about that ?", "NTA\n\nThat's a mean spirited \"joke\" he was trying to spring on his mom. I'm with you, you don't joke about being pregnant.", "NTA.  I don't see a problem with joking about pregnancy in general when all parties are on board (though getting his mom's hopes up as a joke is a dick move), but you were never consulted about it. He was dragging you into a joke you didn't want to be a part of. You have every right to bail out of it.  She may be his mom, but you're your you.\n\nPersonally, I can't stand it when people try to drag me into their jokes or lies, or try to speak for me.  It's disrespectful.", "NTA. You were in the right to put a stop to that before anything else was said. Your husband's joke brought you into it and without any warning or consent. Pregnancy isn't supposed to be a joke. He should know better than that.", "Huh? So who\u2019s going to be a grandma again?", "NTA\n\nHIS \"joke\" centered around YOU being pregnant.   You dont have to play along with that and upset his mother.  He is clearly TAH in this situation.

And I use the work joking *very* lightly here because nothing about that sounds even remotely funny", "NTA I'm actually quite confused however.\n\nHow is this a joke? Jokes are supposed to be funny. If the victim doesn't find it funny it wasn't a joke. It was bullying.", "NTA. He's not funny.", "NTA.

You don\u2019t make jokes about pregnancy.
