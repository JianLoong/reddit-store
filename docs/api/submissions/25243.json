And people who don't fly all the time aren't necessarily aware of these policies. This isn't a new thing, either.

They would need to help him get logged into the iPad and get the show up and running, though then he can click between episodes fine on his own. He usually tells somebody if he needs to pee, though it would be helpful if they asked him partway through the flight since when the kids around kindergarten or 1st grade age are so engrossed in a movie or TV show they sometimes don\u2019t think of it and can still wet themselves. \n\nIf my kid asks for sticky drinks, I hope either the person next to him or the air flight attendant would be smart enough to hand him the cups only partially full rather than a full can of soda, or that is a disaster waiting to happen in terms of the full cup or can can getting knocked off the tray and spraying everywhere. I think my main fear for the person next to him would be that he would somehow dump a soda in their laptop by hitting the tray table with his knee or something terrible like that. They still tend to spaz out quite a lot even as big little boys up to fourth or fifth grade. But hopefully the neighbor would have enough of a brain to also help facilitate avoiding that, by telling the flight attendant not to let him have a full can, and maybe strategically keeping their own devices a little distance away. \n\nOn our most recent fight, the most annoying thing my son did at first was kick the seat in front of him \u2014 not maliciously, but he didn\u2019t understand there was somebody in front of him since he couldn\u2019t see them over the tall seat, and the the row had been empty when we walked past it\u2014 so it was important that I was there to chastise and stop him. So I would worry what will happen if I am not there to nip it in the bud? but most likely a neighbor would not have to deal with it.. surely eventually the annoyed person in front would turn around and tell him to quit it, so I imagine the problem would eventually reach a tipping point and solve itself , even if he was being obnoxious and the situation/row people would not adjust so I could be present to actively parent through the situation more harmoniously\n\nBut as you say, overall this is probably the age where they could do it. I think by six and seven years old they are emotionally old enough to handle takeoff and landing fine, so that\u2019s not a problem.

Even a Kindergartener is old enough to probably just sit there calmly.\n\nIf I get stuck last minute because of an airline change in this kind of situation again, My own preference would be to try to make a switch so I can just parent my own kid - but I can understand if somebody really wants their original seat and refuses to switch.

I asked the person in front of me if they would switch (aisle for aisle, same legroom, identical seat just in row 15 instead of 14) and she angrily refused.  Another person voluntarily switched out of a window seat into a middle for me.  No one is entitled to a seat, but IMO if you're traveling solo and offered a truly equivalent seat, you should switch. OP is NTA though, as OP was not offered an equivalent seat.", "Really this is on the airline to sort though, kids aren\u2019t supposed to be left unsupervised on planes? \n\n\u201cNo one is entitled to a seat\u201d is incorrect, people are entitled to the seats they have paid for, but that said I do have to wonder at your specific example here, as a frequently solo traveller I would have been grateful to move away from two errant unsupervised children (gasp, the horror), how odd!", "Yeah one row back shouldn\u2019t ever be an issue. 3-5 back is probably where I start to get annoyed but your situation was truly the same seat."]}
