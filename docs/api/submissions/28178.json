Youre a good mom here for listening to him.", "NTA at all, your son is old enough to make this choice and you are supporting him to not have to deal with a neglectful sperm donor anymore.", "Your kid is sixteen. He doesn\u2019t wanna have anything to do with his sperm donor. Leave him alone. \n\nIn the years to come, he *may* develop an interest in his bio dad. There is plenty of  time for his dad to make it up to him for all the years of a sense and indifference. Plenty of tone-*later*. \n\nBut if you drag a sixteen year old into therapy by the scruff of his neck to make him be happy with his bio dad and his new wife, he is old enough to have formed his own opinions already, and resent you for it. Leave it alone. \n\nYWBTA if you bow to the current, new wishes of the bio dad- after all these years.", "NTA\n\nLet your son know that if and when he wants to do therapy of any sort you will 100% support him. \n\nAnd then let it go. \n\nIf your son is otherwise a good kid, respectful, decent grades, nice friends, well adjusted, doesn\u2019t get into trouble, etc I can\u2019t imagine how forcing him to do this would be beneficial and not cause resentment towards everyone. \n\nI mean, what does ex-partner want you to do? Physically drag him to the car and into a therapists office? Take away his privileges until he complies? Duct tape him to a chair in front of a laptop for a virtual therapy session?", "NTA - your son has already made his decision and you should support that. Dad is the asshole. Your son shouldn\u2019t be subjected to that prick anymore than he already has.", "NTA. The thing about therapy is that it's useless if you don't want to be there, and you can't force anyone to participate in it. If you try and pressure your son into it, he'll physically be there but there's a good chance it actually makes the situation worse and he'll resent them even more. If he were a much younger child I would potentially think it's necessary for you to leverage wisdom, but you already did your leveraging by sending him off to meet with them. It's your ex's fault he was underwhelming emotionally, not yours and not your son's. \n\nYour ex only cares because this makes him look bad to his new wife. New wife wants to build a family and have kids of her own and your ex having abandoned a child he knew about for over a decade is a bad look for what kind of father he'll be to THEIR children. It's not about your son at all, which makes it even more gross. If his relationship with her goes south, will he fall off the radar again and hurt your son in the process? If she decides he is a \"bad influence\" will the interest in building a relationship with him evaporate? These are genuine and fair questions your son might have. \n\nMake sure your son knows that therapy is available to him- family therapy with his bio dad and the new wife, therapy with YOU and your son, or solo therapy if he wants to work through his feelings alone with a professional. Make sure he knows therapy is nothing to be ashamed of and that you'll support him no matter what choice he makes about his bio dad, because you love him and will be there for him regardless. \n\nThen let him make his choice. In less than two years your son will be an adult. This is a tough choice, but it's not one that's too big or too complicated for someone his age. Trust him and trust how you raised him. Unless ex tells you he's dying of cancer or moving to Mongolia, this also need not be a 100% now or never decision. You never know what tomorrow will bring, but simply stating that your son needs time is also valid. Maybe family therapy now isn't what he needs, but it will be in a year or two after he's done more growing and thinking on it. Or maybe he won't! Neither is a wrong choice, as long as they're truly his choices.", "NTA.  Your son is 16 and definitely knows his own mind and what he wants or doesn't want.

As you said, he is 16 and knows, at this time, he doesn't want to pursue a relationship.  He may change his mind in the future.  However, if you press his sperm donors cause, you'll create a rift. He gave him a chance, and dear old dad didn't emit any warm and fuzzy feelings. Your son saw through him and his wife. His loss. \n\nWent through this with my twin boy's donor. I never spoke against him and allowed them to form their own opinions.

I think you\u2019re doing the right thing by letting your child choose what he wants to do. However, if this does get close to going to court, I would make sure you have a chat with your kid about keeping doors open until they shut themselves. \n\nWhat I mean is- if they\u2019re serious about legally forcing your kid, I would talk to him about how much he wants to fight against it. Explain what will happen in court, and remind him that he\u2019s in charge of this decision. He can choose to go to court over it, and you\u2019ll fight with him. And he can also choose to change his mind, and you won\u2019t interfere. What makes the difference is that he\u2019s in charge, you\u2019re backing his decision either way, and you support him fully if he changes his mind. He\u2019s old enough to choose what relationships he has in his life, but he may still need help weighing the benefits and consequences. \n\nOnce he makes the decision, fight the battle you gotta fight, and try to keep as much mud off him as you can.", "YWBTA if you forced your son to do something that he strongly does not want to do.

Dude might not be a serial killer - level AH, but he's turned into a complete AH.  \n\nEx-partner does not want a relationship with your son for the sake of your son.  He wants your son to suddenly feel grateful for having his \"father\" in his life so he (ex-partner) can look like not an AH to the new wife.  \n\nWhat your son really has is a sperm-donor whose new wife is chewing him out for not having a relationship with his offspring.  And your son knows it; which is why he had the balls (go son!) to stand up for himself to them and nope out.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nMy mother nearly damaged her own relationship with my younger brother by pushing him so hard to maintain a relationship with our father post-divorce. Our dad cheated on our mom, and my brother is an extremely principled kind of person. Even at 15 he had zero respect for someone who broke their promises like dad did. Mom kept trying to convince him to spend more time with our dad and to be open to at least meeting his affair partner (who I think he's married to now? We haven't spoken in 10 years), until my brother started pulling back from her as well as dad because he didn't feel like she was respecting his perspective and boundaries.\n\nIf you push your kid too hard now, you're going to cause more problems than you'll solve. Respect his choices around this. Let him set his boundaries. At MOST, you might have ONE more conversation pointing out the potential long-term consequences (like, would he regret not having tried harder if his bio dad died next week?) of his decision just to be sure he's making a considered choice knowing all the factors, but after that, don't push.", "Your son is 16.

His bio mom reached out when he was around your sons age. He entertained it for a short while and ultimately decided not to pursue anything. However that did not resolve internal feelings he had about being abandoned by his bio mom, why he wasn't good enough, how could she not care about him, etc. So now 15 years later he had what would medically be considered a mental breakdown and all these issues with his bio mom are being drug up and he is just now beginning to confront a lot of past issues and unloading a lot of his mental/emotional baggage.\n\nSince your son is saying he doubts his father gives a shit about him, this is what inclines me to say you should encourage him to attend the family therapy at least once. Or if not that, maybe get him into individual therapy so these feelings don't fester.", "NAH:  Of course you can't force your son to go to therapy with his father. But while he may have been a deadbeat in the past I can't think of anything better for him to recommend outside of therapy.
