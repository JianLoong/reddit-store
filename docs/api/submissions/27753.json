And with it a huge increase in salary. Prior to this my husband and I were living paycheck to paycheck due to having to pay back student loans, having to move often, send some money to parents. So when my niece had her birthdays, we would gift her something small like a $30 toy or bib set etc. My BIL and his wife are pretty well-to-do and make I would guess $300k a year and have a lovely home. They would always text us thank you for the gift, etc which was very nice. They also gift me and my husband very expensive things for Christmas/birthdays - like designer sweaters, which is thoughtful - but we never expect it. \n\nWell anyway, fast forward 4 years later, I started my new job about 4 weeks ago and received my first paycheck. Some of it went to paying off moving expenses (cost us $10k for a cross country move), rent and purchasing basic furniture for our new place like a couch and insurance. And some went to savings because we were running dangerously low. Well it's my nieces birthday again and now she is growing into a young child, I wanted to give her something that she could use/save. So I gave her $150 (common to give red envelopes/money in our culture). I guess I could have given more - but I thought that was appropriate for a child and we have expenses coming up. \n\nWell BIL's wife called me and my husband and said thank you for the gift, but that knowing I got a new job could have been more generous since 1 - she is my only niece, 2 - I have a high paying job and \"obviously\" can afford it and 3 - they give us nice things all the time. I told her we never expected expensive gifts and if it is truly a gift you cannot use it against me or as a bribe. And that she doesn't have any reason to know our financials but it was what we could afford at the moment. She huffed and hung up. I just don't understand gift giving anymore.

I see her point that after years of being the rich one and giving more to you than getting from you that dynamic should shift with the new job. The \u201cI never asked for the gifts\u201d was kind of mean\u2014 that\u2019s not how gift giving works in Asian cultures\u2014 you were the poor one so she helped you, now that you\u2019re getting richer than her, denigrating the gifts isn\u2019t nice. \n\nBut she\u2019s wrong to call you out on it so rudely.", "YTA for not adjusting your gift-giving to reflect your changed financial situation.

Your BIL and his wife have consistently been generous to you, and you decide to hold back on your only niece.

Each giver gets to decide what they can or are willing to afford when buying said gift. Your BIL's wife is ungrateful and materialistic enough to actually track your pay. WTF, who the hell does that?!? I am very petty, so I would continue with \"cheap\" gifts from here on out, but you do you. It is not required that you \"match\" her gifts, though.", "NTA, you give gifts based on what YOU feel is appropriate, both in terms of value and what you give. They also don't know about your exact finances, and 150$ is a pretty massive gift for a child if you ask me.\n\nAnd if you give something to someone else expecting a gift of a specific value in return then that is not a gift but a trade.", "NTA. I don't think people with a higher income or more money are obliged to spend more on a gift. If someone likes to give expensive gifts that's fine but they shouldn't expect to get it back. And if it feels awkward for them they shouldn't give such expensive gifts in the future.", "NTA.  They never had to spend so much on you. You don\u2019t have to spend so much on them.  Sounds like they were just waiting for your raise so you could make up for those cheap $30 gifts.  These are people you should never discuss salary with.  Even up once, make it clear what your max is, and be done with that.", "NTA\n\nYou do what you can.\n\nGift giving is not a contest and the IL shouln't have books on it.\n\nStand your ground\n\nGood luck", "NTA it was a gift and demanding more is super rude. They aren't actually entitled to anything at all.", "The proper response was \"Thank you\".\nYour SIL was  rude.\nNTA", "NTA. I wish I had 150 to give my niece. Her and her mama would be so happy lol", "New job or no, no one is entitled to your money.  You have an awful SIL who is obviously keeping score.\n\nFrom now on I would (1) suggest a stated dollar limit on gifts to level-set expectations and stop her score-keeping and (2) give your niece something in that range and also set up a 529 plan for her that you make contributions to.  It will hopefully help her not be such a money-grubbing narcissist like her mother, and she will be stoked when she has money for college.", "NTA - you went from a $30.00 toy to $150.00 in cash which is 5 times more.. What do they expect? Is your new paycheck 5 times more than it was ? \\[not that it matters but trying to understand why they feel $150.00 is not enough\\]", "Some ppl are so entitled.  You did't ask for expensive gifts, they chose to gift them to you.  I think $150 is a very generous bday gift.  Just bc you can afford it, doesn't mean you have to gift more than that.  Your SIL is an AH.  Clearly she's keeping score.  It's not about that.  It's about giving a nice gift to a child & it shouldn't matter how much you spent.", "NTA. For my birthday I would get 20 dollars max with a card and whatever I wanted for dinner that day. I wish I was that lucky.", "No kidding! That\u2019s more than what my boyfriend and I (both physicians) usually buy for Christmas gifts. I was never given a gift anywhere near that much and I would never think to buy my niece something that expensive except maybe a contribution to her education savings account.", "Thank you - I feel it will take us at least 6 months to feel comfortable and not feel the anxiety of living paycheck to paycheck.", "Thank you for your thoughts. I never grew up giving/receiving expensive gifts so there is definitely heterogeneity in asian gift-giving culture. By saying I never asked for the gift, what I meant is I never expected expensive gifts, of course they were appreciated. And it just doesn't feel right to me to give expensive gifts if I am not comfortable giving them just to repay them for what they have given us.", "People aren't required to increase gifts just because they make more money. Nor is amount of money a genuine reflection of celebrating someone. It's appalling to suggest someone can't be genuine just because they don't pay more.", "This person is 100% wrong and wildly out of line.\n\nGifts are just that, GIFTS.\n\nIf there are expectations with gifts that is the *other person's* baggage to carry. Not yours.  You give what you can, if and when you can.\n\nYour finances and current situation are *no one* else's business.\n\nAnyone who tells you different is 100%  an AH.", "You are referring to gifts like business transactions. That is not how gifts are supposed to work, and I would give or accept gifts to or from anyone with a mindset like that.", "I guess I can see your point to an extent. I think my point here is that I don't feel comfortable dropping $500 on a gift or in a red envelope while we are still adjusting financially to our new move.\n\nBut then another question - am I expected to spend a lot of money on future gifts? That's not something I have grown up with. And I certainly don't expect them to spend on me at all. This is perhaps a conversation I need to have with them. It's touchy though.", "Even still, DO NOT FEEL OBLIGATED TO RECIPROCATE MATCHING DOLLAR AMOUNT GIFTS!!!! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a Your finances, money choices, gift limits are you are your partners business alone. Just because they have given you nice gifts, she is their only child, etc does not give them (her) the right to dictate the level of your gift.", "If you keep an eye on new AITAs, you'll see a *whole lotta posts* from that guy lately, just about all of which are an outrageous defense of the person who is in the wrong.

I don't think he's posting in good faith here.", "Yes, people will expect your gift-giving to increase as your income has increased. Some cultures are very individualistic and \u201cwhat\u2019s mine is mine\u201d and a gift is not expected. But in other cultures, helping your close family members financially when you\u2019re well-off is definitely expected.", "Thank you! I want to give gifts, but just something I am personally comfortable with.", "And that is all it ever has to be! This might help too. When I was a kid I had certain relatives spoil me like crazy and others who gave age appropriate gifts. My parents never made an issue and I never saw anything wrong with the age appropriate, less expensive, etc gifts. As an adult now the ones who spoiled me, we don't talk and I am super close with others!!!", "NTA at all.   Your BIL's wife is way out of line", "People assume new doctors are *rolling* in cash.  They don\u2019t see loans, malpractice insurance, the expenses of setting up a practice.  (New Dentists and Veterinarians - I see you too.) \n\nGive the gift you\u2019re comfortable giving.  Though if you don\u2019t plan to reciprocate gifts with your BIL and SIL then don\u2019t accept any yourselves.   It sounds like they\u2019ve gifted you thousands of dollars over the years.  If you continue to accept gifts there are expectations of reciprocity.  NAH.", "If your SIL isn't happy with what you're giving your niece you can adopt me to be your niece and I'll take the $150 shoot that's a good 3 tanks of gas where I live! NTA!", "NTA. She should have stopped at \"Thank you.\"", "My first thought is that I don't know if this is the best community to get advice, as it is primarily American.  There is definitely some cultural nuance at play, and I don't know if people here are really offering a fair assessment of how SIL is viewing this.\n\nI have several close Chinese friends, so my kids get \"red envelope\" gifts.  I am sometimes quite surprised how much money they are gifted, for young children, and tried in the early days to protest such a lavish gift.  But I was always told it was a formula - how much they make and the relationship with the giftee.  \n\nNow this is a huge cultural population.  Clearly, there must be some variation in how people do this.  But I also think that SIL's perception that increased salary equals increased cash gifts is not uncommon.  \n\nWhich doesn't make you the AH.  But as for how best to handle the conversation -- again, I feel like the advice here will be far too combative, as this is very much outside of the American expectations of gifts for children.", "NTA ! $150 is a whole lot of money for a child. Seems like they wanted to get the money from the child and not keep it for the child. If that makes  sense", "I just had a flashback to my childhood reading \"more than I ever was given for a birthday\". \n\nI just remembered my very poor grandma painstakingly scotch taping two one dollar bills inside cards that always had a kitten on the front.  I loved her. Thank you for reminding me", "OP had ONE new paycheck at a job that cost money to move across country to accept.  Are you sure you are considering the details?  It\u2019s not like OP collected the powerball last month.  I am trying to understand your take on this.", "The SIL is being too pushy. But OP seems to me to be applying an American idea of gift-giving to an Asian family and there\u2019s a difference. Americans like to think of gift giving as spontaneous and very emotional, about expressing their hearts, freely giving something the other has zero claim or expectation for, unquestionable and no strings. I don\u2019t think many people actually see gift giving this way but it\u2019s the fantasy. But Asian gift giving is kind of different and more about helping each other, about status. \n\nSIL shouldn\u2019t have been so rude calling her out like this, but it wouldn\u2019t have been rude if someone had taken OP aside and gently said, \u201cNow that you have a good job, it\u2019s kind of expected that the red packets will start to increase\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of like picking up the tab at a restaurant. If big sister earns much more and picks up the bill and you really can\u2019t afford it because you\u2019re a student and you say \u201cthanks\u201d, no one should be offended. But if you are a doctor and your sister who earns less than you picks up the bill and you say \u201cthanks\u201d, she\u2019s going to be miffed. She\u2019d still be an AH to yell at you but she\u2019d have a point that you should know that\u2019s not cool, that after years of picking up the tab, your turn has come.", "Ok I see it a little better.  OP states that BIL and SIL have a 300k income.  OP has one paycheck.  The gift went from $30 to $150.  What would have been a better gift at this juncture for a child? Would it have better to not have made it a red envelope gift since that is a reference to the culture and then missed the mark?  Would it have been better to give one more American style gift and start the red envelope at the next birthday?   It seems like OP tried to do the cultural gift without enough experience to know the rules."]}
