They have an older sister who we consider a member of the family, but who was not raised by us. For simplicity's sake I refer to her as my daughter.\n\nMy daughter (26F) moved in with us last year because she was worried she was going to get fired, and she said she wanted to save money, get her phlebotomy certificate and try to start a new career. The understanding was that my younger daughter (15F) would share her room and that 26F would stay for a year or less. Anyway, long story short, 26F does not have a history of good decisions, and last year was not any different. She did get the phlebotomy certificate, but has not gotten a job in the field. She actually quit the two jobs she had and currently works at McDonalds and has not saved any money.  \n\nA few months ago  15F started mentioning all the things she wanted to do with her room once 26F moved out and she had it to herself again. I gently led her to understand that she should not get her hopes up. Unless we were willing as a family to send 26F out onto the streets, there was a snowball's chance in hell of 15F getting her room to herself anytime soon. 15F gets this and is understandably frustrated and disappointed. 15F likes her room very tidy. 26F is disorganized & messy. 15F gets up at 4 30 am to have a leisurely morning routine and catch her school bus at 6 15. 26F like to chat loudly on her phone well past 11 pm. Etc, etc\n\n15F was talking to me a few nights ago about how she is worried that if 26F stays much longer, it will affect their relationship long term. I told her that Dad and I were half-thinking that we should have 26F  share a room with our son 21M (who does not have a job and seems a bit unmotivated by life). \n\n15F said she had the exact same idea and pounced on it. She and 26F currently share the largest bedroom, which has a sink and vanity area attached. The room is very good sized. 21M has the next larger room, and our younger son, 19M, a full-time college student who works full time as well, has the smallest room. 15F said she could trade with 21M so that 26F could stay where she was, and the two of them would have the largest room. \n\nAnyway, of course the downsides are obvious. 26F and 21M are both adults and prefer to have their privacy and walk around their rooms with little to no clothing on. But everyone prefers to have their own room and their privacy, and 15F has \"done her time\".  Why should the 15 year old have to keep sacrificing just because she shares a gender with the sister? Why shouldn't the two people who are capable of moving out on their own at any time be the ones who are inconvenienced?

They've got an easy life with you at the moment, time to start showing them that living elsewhere would be preferable. \n\nYour 15 year old does deserve some space in order to get the grades she needs to succeed in life. At the moment, her unmotivated sister is stopping her from achieving her own goals. That isn't fair on her. \n\nGet some sort of screen/divider for the biggest room and move them in. They'll either manage, or be motivated to move out. Win!\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I think both your 26F and 21M are old enough to take some responsibility.  If they don\u2019t want to share a room then they need to get a proper job and move out.  I do agree it\u2019s not fair to punish a 15F for her siblings not being responsible", " NTA\n\nPut the two unmotivated oldest kids 26F and 21M in the largest room and put a screen down the middle. The motivated 19M who is in college keeps his own room. 15F who is motivated and doing well gets her own room.\n\nI understand wanting to support 26F, but having her share a room with a fifteen year old was probably pushing it to begin with. That's a big age difference especially if you knew she had a history of troubled behavior.\n\nThere is zero chance that the news of this room swap is going to go down well with 26F or 21M but that's okay. Right now they are way too comfortable with their situation given that they are not working, or underemployed. But I would be prepared that it may cause conflict within the house and 26F ultimately may not be able to stay anyway.", "NTA\n\nBoth of these children of yours are adults.  You're already doing 26F a **huge** favor by letting her stay past the year she agreed to.   I'm guessing she doesn't contribute to the household in any way, from paying for her own food, part of utilities, or doing chores.  The same is likely true of your 21M son.\n\nI hope I am wrong with my past sentence.\n\nIn either case, maybe this will give them the motivation they need to at least get their financial lives in order enough so they move out.  \n\nAs it is right now, neither 26F nor 21M have **any** reason to move out.", "This may sound harsh but, the 26 year old is not your responsibility. She is more than old enough to take care of herself. She needs to leave your house all together. She will never grow up and be responsible if she has you to take care of her.", "YTA for not putting a stop to the behaviors that make 26F a crappy roomie. Why is she allowed to be sloppy and \"chat loudly\" when 15F is trying to sleep?", "NTA and it honestly sounds like an excellent idea. These two adults need some motivation to move out and this should do exactly that! \n\nAs a parent it's the right thing to do yo make sure all your kids have a roof over their heads, food etc (even adult children). It doesn't need to be a 5 star hotel.\n\nYou sound awesome OP!", "NTA\n\nI mean, it probably won\u2019t go over well, but it\u2019s reasonable.  The two oldest still have a free place to live.  And the agreement with 26F was that her stay was to be temporary, you\u2019ve let her stay much longer than that.", "NTA. It's appropriate encouragement for adults to care for themselves.  Do it. :-)", "NTA 15 year old indeed did her time. I was going to vote Y T A from the title, but it does seem like the best decision", "NTA, may give them a little motivation. Put a pep in that step. Your other 2 kids are in school and need space to study and rest.  That can't happen if they share a room with someone loud.", "NTA \n\nSounds like a good motivational tactic.", "NTA - so the two adults who don\u2019t have a job and want their own privacy and unmotivated? Make them share a room. They want privacy, they can get a job and move out.\n\nIf the birds don\u2019t want to leave the nest it\u2019s time to give them a push.", "Nta. She\u2019s 26, not 16. She should take some responsibility for her life. So should your 21 year old.", "It's a difficult one but I'd say NTA so long as it's possible to put some kind of screen up in the shared room for their privacy when they're getting changed in there. They're both likely to hate the idea so hopefully it will encourage at least one of them to move out, but a better idea might be just put 26 on 6 months notice.", "NTA but I think the bigger problem is that you have two adult children who are not doing anything to become independent. One day you'll wake up and it'll be ten years later; they could still be living with you.", "YTA because you're letting a 26 year old make it so a 15 year old can't get adequate sleep, and your \"fix\" is making two adults who are not in a romantic relationship share a room.\n\nKick out the freeloader, or have the two guys share a room", "When I only read the title, I was ready to say ah. BUT after reading the circumstances you are NTA. 26 and 21 need to get their shit together and honestly, imo, need ultimatums. 15 year old sound like she deserves her own room. I\u2019d love an update after you give 21 and 26 the news because I\u2019m guessing they won\u2019t be happy, but too bad they need to get their shit together.", "This is a tough one but YWNBTA (NTA) as it seems like your 15yo is very responsible and deserves/needs her own space. Also maybe putting the 2 adults together might just be the thing that pushes them out of the house and into jobs/their own home? Probably worth a try", "Sounds fair. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour teenage kids should not have their education and development stunted by the failure to launch adults. The two oldest can take a shared free room or leave.", "NTA\n\nThey are adults. If they don't like the living arrangements you provide for them, they can choose to move.", "NTA, it's actually brilliant. \"Oh, brother annoys you? Well you know you can move out.\"", "NTA. As a mother of adult children of both genders, I've also been in situations like this and it's hard...While they are still your children and they do need your support, they need it in a different way than your youngest. She needs the most help right now, and if she has to keep sacrificing for older siblings it won't just impact the relationship she has with her sister, it will impact the relationship she has with you as well. \n\nI think you already have the right answer with the rooms! And it might be the nudge your 2 oldest children need to put in more effort so they can get on their feet.

What about a compromise? You can put up an interior wall to divide the large room; then each of the young adults can have their own small space but your 15 year old can have a room to herself again. It doesn't even have to be a formal wall, that meets building code, since it won't be load bearing... just two panels of plywood with a bit of sound insulation between them. You and the other members of the family could put that up yourselves if you didn't want to hire it out.", "YWBTA instead of solving the problem you want to make it worse? What needs to happen here its very obvious at least to me, you need to sit this girl down and have a serious conversation with her about her future, or at the very least she needs to respect the person who she is sharing her space with. Forcing two adult ppl of opposite genders to share the same room is an awful idea and will transform your home into a hellscape.", "Nope, NTA. They\u2019re all living in your house (presumably rent-free), they abide your rules!", "YTA for letting the 26yo treat the house like this. She's not your kid, not your responsibility. The 15yo is your kid, why did she had to put up with this grown up in her room, messing it up, not letting her sleep??", "YWNBTA", "YWTBA.\n\nIt's not appropriate to have them sharing a room. It's also a big time dick move to your oldest son, who doesn't appear to have done much wrong.\n\nI say just give 26F her notice to leave. She's the oldest and she's currently in work, albeit low paid work, she can get her own place.\n\nBut if you won't do that, then the two men can share a room and 26F can have the small room. Because that way you're not inflicting the noisy mess-maker on anybody else.\n\nEdit: Or, even better, 26F can sleep on the sofa.", "Yeah\u2026 this isn\u2019t gonna go well for you at all. I personally would not even suggest this because the answer is going to be \u201cno\u201d but also, they can always just move out. \n\nAlso, there is a reason why males and females are not supposed to share rooms after a certain age, it has very little to do with wanting to wear no clothes lol contrary to popular belief most people don\u2019t walk around their houses naked.", "NTA, but given that 21M is younger and hasn't yet used up your good graces, consider telling 26F that her time occupying a bedroom in your house is over.

This may be exactly the motivation the two of them need to get their lives in order and move out.", "I wouldn't give them the largest room.

Making things a little less comfortable for them may in fact help with motivation around getting work, etc.\n\nIf the 26 year old kicks up the alternative should be leaving, not staying put.", "NTA. \n\nIf you have someone in your home that's more than capable, but not wanting to do anything, you have to motivate them.  \n\nAs my mom once told me, \"If they don't want to do what they are supposed to, make it uncomfortable enough for them to decide to.\" \n\nIt's time for the two unmotivated people in your house to get some motivation.", "I think 26 f needs to be told some ground rules about neatness and quiet times.

Choices have consequences.", "NTA but really it\u2019s time for 26 to move out- she\u2019s been living there rent free for a year and working, right? She\u2019s never going to grow up if you don\u2019t stop enabling her.

I think that is a good idea about the screen.", "I agree", "26F paid $100 per month last year and we raised it at the year point to $250 to help increase the discomfort of staying here. If she had made any attempt to save money last year, I wouldn't have increased the amount. But I can see that no matter how little she has to pay, she doesn't save any money. She's very tight-lipped and when we tried early last year to help her make a budget, she wasn't very forthcoming about where her money goes. As for the 21M, he has always lived free but we told him this year is his \"slide\" year and he will pay $100, but next year it will go up to $250.", "Right?

That way they can pull them completely closed, or have them open when they want to chit chat.", "I did already share the news with the 21M a few days ago. He took it well, but later told me that he was not comfortable with it. I said I understand, and asked him to suggest an alternative that was NOT having things stay as they are now. \n\nI am now steeling myself to tell him \"too bad\", it is what it is. My 15F wants to tell the 26F herself, because she thinks it will go over better and is worried about the reaction if it comes as a decree from us. \n\nWe are not planning on making the move until summer, because 15F wants to paint, defumigate (lol, she says her brother's room stinks) etc before moving in. So I wanted to let 21M have time to get used to the idea. I feel kind of bad for him, because HE didn't make any promises (and was in school last year), whereas 26F did promise 15F that it would be for only one year.", "I like that idea but out of curiosity, how does the interior wall work if there's only one door into the bedroom?", "That feels like they\u2019re still enabling them though.", "I've heard of parents charging their adult children rent, then saving up the \"rent\" in a separate account, then giving it back to the kid in order to allow them to put a security on their own place, get basics like pots and stuff, and having some security for the first year or so. A launching nest egg, if you will. Something to thing about.", "She wasn't raised by OP, she is the older sibling of the kids raised by OP, presumably an adult by the time the others were adopted.", "She treats her like one though.", "21 year old males are VERY sexually active whether or not they have a partner... shits going to get WEIRD soon\n\ni agree that all possible outcomes are going to lead to ruin.. the best outcome is honestly to probably kick out 26f entirely if there just is no space for her (she seems the best suited to actually move on in life despite her shortcomings so likely would be the better off on their own) -- no matter how you handle this situation its going to end badly.. but shoving a 21m and 26f that are not related into the same room when 21m probably masturbates like 2-3 times a day is about to get all kinds of fucked up, ESCPECIALLY if either of the 2 are into weird stuff, stuff they can no longer do privately lol (like for instance, im really into sex toys, good luck doing that with someone else in the room)", "Generally, you make the new wall at right angles (so really two walls, I guess) -- one which goes down the middle of the space between the rooms until you get to about two feet before you get to the (original) wall of the room, the one the door is on. The second wall turns toward the door, and ends just before you get to it. That way they can both use the doorway -- person A just ducks to their left around the edge of the new wall and into their room, when they come in the door. Person B makes a quick right when they enter their doorway, walks along wall #2 until they get into the open space that is their own room, and there they are. Neither one is completely free of sound between the two spaces because it can travel around the inner walls via the doorway space, but you can minimize that by adding a plain wooden door to each new roomlet if you really want to.", "We will help her financially IF and when she starts showing some ability to save her money. But she never has two nickels to rub together. Every time she has an unforeseen expense, she borrows money from us. She does pay it back, usually immediately when she gets the next paycheck. We don't ask her to pay us back this fast, but she doesn't like owing us anything.", "Yes, that is correct. She came up through the foster system and opted out for independence at age 17 when she moved in with a boyfriend's family.", "And that's great on op's part, but it's still not her responsibility. The 15yo child should come first. She's op's actual child since she was adopted, she is a minor. Her needs are more important than a 26yo who is not her kid.", "Then the 26 year old needs to get her shit together. OP is doing the best they can given the situation and that teenage girl deserves to have her own room.", "They ARE related, they are brother and sister. And I'm ready for 21M to get a job and his own place, where he can do as he likes, too. Really these two are fine for each other. 21M keeps 15F and 19M awake at all hours screaming at video games.  He sleeps until 4 pm. I am really ready for him to be inconvenienced, too.", "This is really helpful. I drew a picture of what you are describing and it makes sense, except that we have a walk-in closet and the sink space. I think I can make it work with three dividers. It won't be pretty, but oh well, I guess.", "And she's addressing them. She's doing awesome balancing everyone.", "100% .. might be different if there was the room for them but it truly sounds like there isnt room for all of them in that house  \n\n\nat 26 with a degree i believe her to be the best suited for life outside the home, as for 21m they need to get ready to face the reality that they too are old enough to start thinking about a life outside the home", "Adressing them would be telling the 26yo to live somewhere else. She's enabling her", "You are right. I am enabling her, and I need to stop. In my defense, I enable her with my children's blessing, though. They want to protect her and she makes sure that she tells them often that she will be living on the street. She also tells them that she will consider suicide. \n\nMy brother committed suicide at age 42, so I know a little about what that would mean. But I also know something that a therapist told me years ago...when a person feels the kind of agony that causes suicide, there is nothing that a person on the outside can do that can stop that pain. It is not our fault when a person commits suicide. There is nothing we can do from the outside to stop that pain. \n\nI'm just rambling to myself, now, but I am trying to do the right things here. I'm not trying to hurt anyone."]}
