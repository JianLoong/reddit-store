What does WASP mean?", "NTA at all. It's great that your Dad is getting help and putting his life together and a bonus that you understand and seem willing to work on a relationship. The big thing here is, though (and as others have pointed out), do you really want to deal with your SO's controlling and judgemental family for the rest of your life? For example, my involvement with my grandparents became minimal after I got married because they pissed off my Navy Old Guy by asking when he was going to leave the military and \"get a real job\" every time they saw him. That's mild stuff compared to how these people seem to be looking down their nose at you. I'm offended for you at this point. This isn't just one off behavior. This is a window into what your married life will be like. They've shown you who they are, can you live with their abuse?", "NTA\n\nWho tf in-laws think they are to proclaim that a father is not entitled to her daughter's love and forgiveness?

NTA.  Entirely, unequivocally, NTA.\n\nFirst your relationship with your father is none of their business.  Second it's not their wedding, it's yours.  The \\*only\\* person who even gets to ask for an explanation is the one you're marrying since it's their wedding too and even they wouldn't be ok to flipping deny his being there.  The rest of them can pound sand, politely.\n\nAnyone who is trying to dictate this to you though?  Them's some assholes.", "NTA.\n\nFirstly, your in-laws sound pretentious, judgemental, and domineering. Be careful when the time comes for you to start a family (if you decide you want that of course). I can see your in-laws interfering in how you raise your children.\n\nSecondly, the problem with letting family pay for a big wedding is that it has the potential to become their day, not yours. And obviously, as the bride (with the groom's input), this is your day.\n\nSo regardless of what your in-laws think of your father, inviting him or not inviting him is not their decision to make. It is absolutely your decision.\n\nYou are right to cancel the wedding. Discuss with your fianc\u00e9 what a perfect wedding for the two of you would be, and go with that.", "NTA at all. It might be generous of them to offer to do this wedding for you, & I can see compromising on small things, but to deny the bride the opportunity to invite whoever she considers important in her life is a major AH move. \n\nI\u2019m glad your fianc\u00e9 supports you & I hope you guys have a beautiful day with your dad there", "NTA. It is your wedding. If someone wants to pay for a wedding, it comes with the expectation that they are paying but it is someone else's day. Sure, they can set budgets and some expectations, but topics such as whether you invite your father are off the table. That is your decision. \nI hate when family offers to pay as a form of control. That's what they did and it backfired. \n\nIt sucks that your fiancee's family is threatening not to come to the smaller ceremony, but that's on them. Make sure you support your fiancee, but realize his family refusing to come is their choice. They would rather miss the wedding entirely if they cannot control the event. That says more about them than you.", "Listen, you can love your fiance and everything, but keep in mind this is the rest of your life. You marry into the family.\n\nYou're solidly NTA, the family is ridiculous, but you need to ask yourself if you can keep having these arguments for the rest of your life, because they're not going to just go away.

Look, he messed up and he ended up owning responsibility for that. He's apologized, he continues to get help, and you are working on a relationship.
