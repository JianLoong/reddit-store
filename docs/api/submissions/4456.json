Emphasize that it\u2019s not *her* company you don\u2019t want, you don\u2019t want company on this trip because you want to feel independent.  If appropriate, tell her this is like going away to university or your first day in elementary school. Mothers can\u2019t come along on those.\n\nIt could be that rather than (or in addition to) being over-protective, your mom just wants to travel and going with you would give her \u201can excuse\u201d or a way of not traveling alone.  If that is the case, you might state or suggest that you won\u2019t mind going on a trip together next time, just *not this trip.*\n\nThese suggestions are to help you defuse the situation, reduce hurt feelings, and maybe get her to back off and stop guilting you. However, if you don\u2019t want to bother, that\u2019s fine too.  You are not required to take your mom along on a trip when you are an adult.  NTA (and have fun on your trip.)", "I travelled from Australia to Europe at the age 20.  By myself.  Looong before internet.  Loooong before mobile phones.  Just good old landlines that cost a bomb to phone home and good old postcards.\n\nMum's just jealous because you are organising  a trip by yourself.  Put your foot down and tell her you're going by yourself.  Tell her that the two of you can do another trip together later on down the track.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your trip, your vacation.  She sounds like the type of person who if she knows when and where you are going would make reservations without telling you and show up.  Don\u2019t let her know where you\u2019re staying.  Then again I may be cynical and totally off base.", "NTA and your mother should get that a mid twenties woman does not want to do the same things as her mother.", "NTA. Oof ouch yikes. you're an adult and this sounds like a fantastic opportunity. have a fun trip and stay safe.", "Omg no, NTA at all.\n\nIdk if your mom is just worried for your safety or if she's trying to make this her own vacation, but you should be able to live this type of experiences by yourself. \n\nIn the other hand, you're going to be a young tourist woman in a completely unknown country, BE CAREFUL, please.", "NTA.   I think your mum has forgotten you are grown up, used to happen to me.  I used to remind mum how old she was  when she moved out and hold she was when she married and had kids, it shut her up rather quickly.", "NTA. It's your trip, you can invite (or in this case, not invite) anyone you want. I wonder if your mom knows how much extra it'd cost to bring a whole second person along on a trip like this, too.", "NTA and your mother is being weird and overbearing, is she like this in other areas of your life? If you were 18 and fresh out of school I could understand it a little more but you're a whole ass adult. Does she want to come along to make sure you don't do anything she doesn't approve of? That's such a huge expense for her to be outlaying", "NTA. It's your holiday. Experience it as you wish.", "And did you tell her you don't want her on the trip when she asked?", "NTA. As a fellow mum with kids your age, it's probably down to anxiety due to her not being able to protect you whilst you're away. (yeah yeah, you're a grown woman- but these feelings don't leave you regardless of how old your kids get!)\n\nDo what we did when mine went travelling- promise (and stick to your promise!!) That for the first week you will text twice a day for the first week. Just \"Hi, im fine!\"xxx  Once the first week is over she'll be used to you being away, have calmed down and relaxed a bit. Have an amazing trip!", "NTA", "NTA. You don't have to travel with anyone you don't want to.\n\nJust curious: has she always wanted to go to France or does she have difficulty letting you go?\n\nAlso, France is beautiful in summer but if you have 6-7 weeks don't only do the south. We've been having a lot of heat waves in the summer, so some areas are just way too hot to do much. Rent a car and drive around the different areas, also the mountains or the north.", "Nta", "NTA. It's perfectly ok that you also want to do things on your own. Tell your mom that you want to do this on your own for self growth.

This was just when cell phones started to be a thing. We wrote letters, the odd phone call.\n\nTell your mum that you want to do this on your own. You want to have adventures and you'll check in with her once a week. Do not say you'll call/ facetime every day as you probably won't. Mum needs to give you some space to be a grown up.", "Instead of going to university straight away my older sister took a gap year and travelled to the uk from Australia (flying with a friend) at age 19 to work in a boarding school for a year. We do have family in England who she stayed with sometimes while there and they helped her out when needed but she also travelled around Europe on her own or with friends during the school holidays and the weekends that she wasn\u2019t working. She learnt a lot during that year and she\u2019s now 24. That gap year is something she will never regret and it made become the independent person I know today.
