When I was very young, I had my son Jason. He was my everything, I worked so hard to give him a good life, I managed to send him to boarding school and a good university. When he was 22 and about to graduate, he proposed to his girlfriend Amber because she got pregnant. Jason died after graduation and it wasn't anybody's fault, just a big car crash. Amber couldn't handle things so she went home to Edinburgh which is across the ocean, she told me not to contact her and though I tried a lot over the years, I've never been able to find her.\n\nAbout three years after, I realized I was tired of living in routine and put myself back out there. I met Max, who was four years younger than me, and things kicked off and we got married. We had a daughter named Ellie. Now, it is too painful for me to think about Jason anywhere but my memories or when I feel safe at grief counseling. I had all photos and mementos and everything placed in storage. There's no sign around my house that he ever lived there, I have made it clear to Max we are never to talk about him and I never spoke about him to Ellie. I don't care if you think this is healthy or not but this is what has worked for me.\n\nNow Ellie is fifteen and I don't know how but she was rummaging through the attic and found some pictures that my mom had taken of me during my pregnancy with Jason. She realized pretty quickly that wasn't when I was pregnant with her and came barging in for answers. Max ended up telling her because I ended up crying. Then she yelled at me for keeping this a secret and how there's a whole part of her she doesn't know about. I got mad and yelled that he's my son and mine only and he doesn't belong to anybody and nobody has any right to know about him unless I say.

This is about trying to meet everybody's emotional needs and healing.  The way you deal with this has potential to draw you closer to Ellie or to drive you apart.  You say you don't care if we think it is healthy or not to act as though Jason never existed, but your coping mechanism is unhealthy and is liable to cause you more grief.  It's already causing Ellie grief.", "If this was working out for you, you wouldn\u2019t be acting like this now. I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s true, you need more help than whatever you\u2019re getting now, and now your daughter probably needs counseling to process this because your method backfired spectacularly. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, but grief can really corrupt people and it\u2019s showing now that you yelled at your daughter for putting two and two together. She\u2019s a child, and you blew up on her all because you couldn\u2019t handle it. I have to say YTA for that part.\n\nEDIT: YTA X100 for this comment\n\n\u201cI have healed as much as I ever will and she has nothing to heal from\u201d\n\nOmfg. You just dismissed your own daughter\u2019s feelings over this revelation like she just scraped her knee on the sidewalk or something. this realy shifted judgement from a soft asshole to a huge one.\n\nEdit: monster was too harsh. Sorry about that", "Very gentle YTA. Jason was your son, but Ellie is also your daughter. I understand grief and how painful it can be, and you didn't have a really healthy way of handling the fact that he was gone. Ellie had a half brother, and very likely may be an aunt to a child in Scotland. I'm not saying she deserved to know, but when another human being is hurt by something it's good to get to the bottom of why instead of lashing out about your hurt first.\n\nEdit: name correction", "I'd like to go N A H because you're obviously still grieving your son, but your daughter has a right to know she had a brother who died before she was born, and may have family in Scotland. You shouldn't have yelled at her. So, very soft YTA - please let you and Ellie go talk to a family therapist about this.", "Grief is a very tricky thing and you have the right to bring these things up if and when you are able, in a way that is safe for you. Ellie has the right to know about her family, her brother included. It's all very difficult but now she knows he existed it might be good to know more about him. I think you're just a little bit of an AH for saying he was only yours, because he was his wife's husband, he was your daughter's brother, he was is own person; I think it was a little harsh to say that to her when she is just finding out she had a brother she didn't know about and so is of course upset.\n\nI think family counselling is something that you need to have with your daughter. Good luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: changing my vote to YTA reading your responses to this and other comments through the thread it's clear that you are not taking your daughter's needs into consideration and it isn't clear why you wanted reddit's input if you are telling everyone they're wrong. You've brought up at several points that your daughter is not a replacement but no one said that she was, that was something you brought up and I'm not going to comment further than this really sticks out to me. It's fine if you want to continue to grieve to yourself about your lost son, but your living daughter has found out an emotional bombshell and needs her mom but you can't get over yourself. Greiving doesn't make you an AH, being and AH to your living daughter makes you the AH.", "YTA reading through tour comments is painful. You keep repeating the same idea that not talking about your son \"works for you \" and stating therapy and talking about it yourself won't help you. But\n You are not doing all right. I'm going to say it again. You are not all right. If it's been this long since his death and the idea of talking about him to his sister who is  YES INDEED HIS SIBLING despite for some reason doubling down over and over that because she didn't know him she has no right to know about him, is something you cannot do without this kind of reaction you have not processed it or ever dealt with it in a healthy way. Does there need to be pictures and shrines ? No. Does erasing his existence from this world so you can just never think about it really help you or your daughter in any way? I'm going to say no as well. I know you keep saying no to it but from a mental health standpoint I do truly wish you'd go and see someone to work through this with your daughter* and really discuss it with her and your memories. I cannot believe there are no happy memories, \nno milestones, no events that can be shared with his sister. I understand being overwhelmed and heartbroken but my god do you think your son would have wanted to be so utterly forgotten? To have no one know about him, his life, his accomplishments, his dreams? \n  \nAnd I'm not saying you'll ever be over/past your son's passing (which btw I'm very very sorry for there are no words that adequately say how sorry I am for that kind of loss) or that the pain will ever go away. But you are not responding to this in any healthy manner. \n\nHe was your son. But he was also your daughter's brother regardless of if she knew him. As someone rightly pointed out in other comments I guarantee she's thinking things like \"if something happens to me mom is going to make it like I never existed\" and I'd say she'd be right to those fears. Talk to your daughter about her brother. Tell her his favorite things, the places he liked to go, the friends his used to have.  Do not put him out of existence or ruin a relationship with your daughter.", "NAH.  You walled up a part of yourself that was too painful to deal with - maybe not the best approach, but we all have our emotional defenses.  But your daughter's reaction is just as reasonable, if not more so. You need to accept two things now: 1) Not telling your daughter about Jason hurt her deeply, and 2) The secret is out, so you need to talk about it.  It may take a long time for a 15-year-old to understand and empathize with the emotional complexity of your loss, but as the parent you have to help her navigate the revelation that a huge and significant portion of her mother's life was kept from her, making her feel like she doesn't truly know her own mother.\n\nI cannot recommend family therapy enough, here. It will help.", "YTA for yelling at your daughter when she discovered you had a son. She's 15! What an absolutely terrible way to treat your CHILD! Sit down and TALK to her. If you can't talk to the people closest to you about your SON who was the center of your universe for 22 years, you need a different therapist because the one you have isn't doing you any favors.", "A very gentle YTA.\n\nIt's going to take her some time to understand where you're coming from here, and that's going to take a conversation.  And before that happens, you need to think about where *she's* coming from, too.  Because you're the parent and she's still learning to navigate things.\n\nTo her, she just found out that you hid over 22 years of history from her - and no, she doesn't understand exactly why.  There was an entire person who was her brother who from her perspective was just...erased.  *Nobody* in her life ever acknowledged the existence of this entire person who lived for 22 years.\n\nRight now, she feels like she doesn't really know her mother.  Right now, she's been confronted with issues of young mortality, and may also be thinking about what you'd do if anything ever happened to *her.*  She may not just feel (whether justified or not) like you've in some way betrayed her, but also like you've betrayed your son.  She may think he wouldn't want to have been hidden away.\n\nAnd she may just want to know *who he was.*  This person who was such a big part of your life and your heart.\n\nShe's a kid, who doesn't know where you're coming from, because you haven't communicated with her except to yell at her that she has no right to know *anything* about him.\n\nThe fact is, though you never intended for her to know, she *does* now and she can't unknow it.  You need to deal with the fallout of that.\n\nReally, I don't think this *is* working for you anymore.", "Ugh I don\u2019t think this was the right sub for your post. I\u2019m so sorry about your loss and everything you\u2019ve felt. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s an asshole", "Well you definitely shouldn't have laid claim to him as only yours since he is her brother, however you are entitled to your feelings same as her. Thing is, a conversation needs to happen so she can know why it's so hard for you to talk about and why. Open the door for her to know about the brother she never got to meet and be open about how it makes you feel talking about it. It can be therapeutic for you both. I've been in a similar situation and it was hard for my kids for a bit but they understand better now", "Sorry but YTA, the grief of losing someone especially a child never goes away. However, you yelling at your daughter because you can't handle it, is wrong. You need a new therapist or psychiatrist because your lashing out at a teen is not healthy.\n\nAlso understand from her perspective she is at a major milestone age where hormones and emotions are over running her life. To think you were an only child and had no siblings of any kind and then to suddenly find out is a bit of a blow.", "Politely as possible, YTA\n\nYour choices to completely erase your deceased son from your life are your choices. And it makes sense that you are still grieving, and as you said in your own way, which isnt that healthy, but again your choice. \n\nYou didn't conceal him enough though and your daughter found out. She has a right to know that she had a brother, that she had a sibling. And I can understand how she feels a part of her is missing. While I dont have a deceased sibling (That I know of), I don't converse with my dad at all, he cut himself out of my life, so I dont know how many siblings I have in reality or even much about his side of the family. I had to do ancestry DNA to find it out. \n\nEllie was probably going to find out sooner or later and she deserved to know, even if it is hard to talk about. You could have even asked Max to help you break it to her. Also there was no reason to yell at her that she, essentially doesn't have a right to know. That reaction alone shows that you should go to therapy.", "Very soft YTA\n\nHe's was her blood. He (as you've said) would be her brother if her was still alive. You daughter also should know because out thier she has a niece/nephew she would be related to due to her brother.\n\nYou cant gatekeep him, she does have every right to know. What you've done isn't healthy and you are being awful to your daughter.", "NAH\n\nOf course everyone is all emotional right now. Give it some time.\n\nBut she's definitely going to want to know about her brother. If you can't talk about it you can't talk about it, but you should at least try. Otherwise she's going to be rightfully pissed.", "NAH - you're not an asshole for what you did, but your daughter does have a right to be upset about having part of her family hidden from her. That's a brother she never knew, that she might want to know things about. It must be very sensitive and I'm sorry for your pain, but now it's time for both of you to apologise and talk things out.\n\nEdited to fix spelling error", "Super soft YTA.  No judgement OP, and I know how time can get away from us.  One moment you're probably thinking \"Well, i'll tell her if she finds out\" and the next moment she's 15 and how are you supposed to break that news, especially when it is so difficult to talk about?  \n\nYour daughter does have a right to know about her brother and about your struggle in coping with it.  It helped shape who you are, and she wants to know what made you the woman you are today.  You should sit down with your daughter and explain that you were not trying to keep things from her, that it was just too painful to talk about.  I'm sure if you were in her position you would want the same.  Good luck OP!", "NTA. I lost my son 13 years ago, he was 20.  I share your pain.  Everyone handles grief in their own way.  You chose to hide and keep it to yourself.   Your daughter shouldn't have yelled at you but she's 14 and in shock, that's how they react.\n\nJason is no longer just yours and you need to figure this out.  Have you gone to grief counseling?  Would you consider telling Ellie more about him?  Yes, I know how much it hurts but in my reality I never want Matthew's name to be forgotten.  You may find some comfort in this.  Sending love and strength.", "YTA mostly to yourself. You could\u2019ve avoided all of this by gently telling her when she was younger that she had a big brother that you loved very much who has passed on.

You kept this secret long enough trying to protect yourself. Let it out. Trust your family. Trust your daughter she is 15. She deserves your trust if you ever expect to implicitly trust you. Don't let the memory of your son be what kills all hope of a real bond and trust with his sister.", "NTA but let me explain - You were not prepared for her to come baring in and demanding answers to something so deeply tucked away inside your heart that it didn't ever occur to you that while it hurts so gd much - sharing him with your daughter would be something Jason would have wanted. \n\nYou had some trauma not only over the loss of your son, but over the loss Amber- who has your grand baby that you are not allowed to see...hear from or know of... I am so so sorry this happened to you. Because this happened and Amber set this tone of - Go away forever - you kind of hid this entire tragic story away.\n\nYou screaming at your daughter and saying he's only yours actually makes sense since in that moment you were only reacting to her demanding an answer to why the heck haven't you ever brought him up before... but it doesn't make it right.\n\nI still don't think you are the ah but you do need to take your daughter to where you have all his things in storage and open up to her about this - maybe be assisted by a therapist?? That's up to you both... but please ask for forgiveness from her for reacting that way. You should not except an apology from her since she is just a child but you can tell her why you kept it a secret. \n\nAs sad as your story is - this is a bonding moment that you both can have by sharing him and his memories with each other - this made me cry so much and I hope - truly that you and your daughter work it out - it would be so beautiful and a happy ending - please also be gentle on yourself as you also need to heal and your 1 bad reaction doesn't make you a monster - it makes you human.", "While I have sympathy, YTA.  Your daughter mostly likely feels shocked and possibly deceived, don\u2019t let this destroy your relationship. \n\nSit her down, answer some questions and let her know that you weren\u2019t trying to hide information, you were trying to figure out how to continue life without your son and did what you could at the time. \n\nI hope you are able to find peace", "YTA, a lie of omission is still a lie you've told your daughter daily for 15 years.", "NAH it was an emotional moment nobody was expecting or prepared for.

Which she found out about by poking through boxes that were tucked away in the attic. Wow, her mom has a *past*, an actual complicated existence before she was even born. \n\nNTA and I want to suggest you get on some DNA registries.

You've been through something incredibly difficult, and everyone deserves to handle their grief in their own way. It's understandable that Ellie is upset she never knew she had an older brother, and she's 15 so she's taking it out on you, but you didn't hide it to upset her.

Your reaction was over the top but I can't call you an asshole for an emotional reaction.

Goodness knows that 35 years ago mental health services are Not anything like as available as they are today, not to mention the stigma that was breaking down, but still very prevalent. People were mostly expected to handle grieving on their own. You did the best  you could, and you found a way to move forward. You put a hard wall between your past life and your present.  I can see why, as the only person in your life who has any actual memory of your son, and how thouroughly Amber cut you out of her life, that you wouldn't want to share those memories or have to field questions about the things you have no way of knowing. It was your loss, and your right to handle it the way that seemed best for you.\n\nIt is also understandable that Ellie is hurt to find out that you had another child that she never knew about. It's understandable that she is very upset about the way you lashed out at her. She would have had absolutely no idea the amount of anguish she caused you.

I know A Lot of people will disagree with me on this, but your history -this particular history - belongs to You. You don't have to talk about it. It is enough for her to know that she had a half-brother who died in an accident before she was ever born, and that you don't want to talk about it. You have boundaries on this. She needs to learn to respect them. She's young though, still a child, and she will need help. And you will need help to not lash out like that at her. \n\nFamily therapy and individual therapy will likely do a lot to help you both.

That is some very toxic, unhealthy, narcissistic take on who a person is or was.\n\nHe was a dad to be, a loved partner, a potential older brother. Not your puppet.\n\nYou made it clear to your daughter she doesn't matter and that she's nothing. She deserved to know her family history ( God knows what connections she's now making between your past behaviour and this news ).", "I'm stuck. Leaning ESH but very lightly for both sides because grief can be ugly and complicated and no one is handling it well here. I'm not interested in judging if you've dealt with his death in a \"healthy\" way to this point, but you don't have much a choice now but to deal with it in a different way now. \n\n**For her,** I think it was careless and self-centered to run in screaming at you over finding this without stopping to think through why that was a bad idea. She risked adding to your trauma, and it makes sense that you'd be defensive. But she's a teenager who just learned that she has a brother that no one ever told her about. It makes sense both that's she's upset with you for not telling her, and that she wants to know about him. \n\n**For you,** you seem to still believe, after the initial argument, that she was out of line to feel entitled to know about him. I don't think you're seeing clearly through your grief, and it's causing you to treat her unfairly. \n\nI'm not sure how much kids are entitled to know about their parents' past but not telling her she had a sibling (a long time ago) is a really big omission that probably left her with a confusing and complicated grief when she found out, and you never gave her the opportunity to process that in an emotionally safe way. You say no one gets to know about him unless you say, but that's impossible outside of your household. Other people outside of your family unit know about him, and the only person who was forbidden from knowing was your daughter. She also likely feels a deep sense of rejection because of that. \n\nMy friend was born shortly after her father died in a crazy accident, and she deals with a complicated grief over a person who actually existed who she can only interact with through ideas and stories, who she can't reach or know. She told me the only way she could describe the grief was that she knew there was a hole there from an early age, and she was only ever to tell the shape, depth and size of the hole once she started hearing stories and memories about him from family. Then she was able to start filling the hole with those stories. Your daughter now knows there is a hole in her life, and she doesn't know how to fill it. She's also probably upset she didn't know the hole was there until now. Maybe she perceived it, otherwise, what was she looking for in the attic? \n\nHow she feels makes sense, and your stance that she isn't at all connected to your son just isn't true. He had half of your genes, and so does she. He's the only other one in the world that shares that with her, even if he isn't here anymore. He was her brother, even if she never met him, just like the man that died in that crazy accident is my friend's father even though she didn't get the privilege. Your daughter is 15, and she is dealing with a discovery that is causing her grief. We make our lives in stories, and now she realizes this somehow ties into hers and she's not sure how to process it. How do you want this chapter to end for her? Coming into loving a brother she just discovered through memories and therapy and, eventually, understanding why you made your choices? Or do you want to draw a hard line and push this back into the attic, making Ellie deal with her grief on her own and festering a resentment that may never heal?", "I\u2019m so sorry \u2764\ufe0f but very soft YTA.\n\nYou might not think your son\u2019s existence and death has anything to do with your daughter, but of course it does. He\u2019s your brother, and although your grief is strong, you cannot gate-keep death. Keeping something so big from her is bound to give some form of a reaction. To her, she doesn\u2019t understand your reasoning for not telling her. She only knows that you didn\u2019t trust her enough to talk about it with her (whether that\u2019s true or not). I was your daughter\u2019s age when I found out a huge family secret that was hidden from me, and changed the way I view my parents forever. \n\nShe\u2019s just a kid. Think about her shoes, she found out something as big as a half brother, and when she sought for answers she was screamed at by her parents and caused her mom to breakdown. I think she\u2019s feeling a lot more than sad. \n\nI think family counseling would help a lot for you all. You are entitled to grieve in whatever way you need, but this has now become the type of situation where you need to talk about it to get past it as a family. \n\nThis is going to be a core memory for your daughter, and you want to make sure it\u2019s not going to completely damage you and your partner\u2019s relationship with her going forward.", "YTA you\u2019re being aggressively dismissive of you\u2019re daughter\u2019s feelings.

Ellie did and does have the right to know she had a brother even though he lived his whole life before she was born.

No, I don't think she has a right to know, I think she **wants** to know and those are two very different things. I know I would also want to know about a brother that existed, it's human nature I think. \n\nI do think your daughter has very valid feelings that shouldn't be dismissed.
