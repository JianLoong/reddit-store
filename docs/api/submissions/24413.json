When I was very young, I had my son Jason. He was my everything, I worked so hard to give him a good life, I managed to send him to boarding school and a good university. When he was 22 and about to graduate, he proposed to his girlfriend Amber because she got pregnant. Jason died after graduation and it wasn't anybody's fault, just a big car crash. Amber couldn't handle things so she went home to Edinburgh which is across the ocean, she told me not to contact her and though I tried a lot over the years, I've never been able to find her.\n\nAbout three years after, I realized I was tired of living in routine and put myself back out there. I met Max, who was four years younger than me, and things kicked off and we got married. We had a daughter named Ellie. Now, it is too painful for me to think about Jason anywhere but my memories or when I feel safe at grief counseling. I had all photos and mementos and everything placed in storage. There's no sign around my house that he ever lived there, I have made it clear to Max we are never to talk about him and I never spoke about him to Ellie. I don't care if you think this is healthy or not but this is what has worked for me.\n\nNow Ellie is fifteen and I don't know how but she was rummaging through the attic and found some pictures that my mom had taken of me during my pregnancy with Jason. She realized pretty quickly that wasn't when I was pregnant with her and came barging in for answers. Max ended up telling her because I ended up crying. Then she yelled at me for keeping this a secret and how there's a whole part of her she doesn't know about. I got mad and yelled that he's my son and mine only and he doesn't belong to anybody and nobody has any right to know about him unless I say.

This is about trying to meet everybody's emotional needs and healing.  The way you deal with this has potential to draw you closer to Ellie or to drive you apart.  You say you don't care if we think it is healthy or not to act as though Jason never existed, but your coping mechanism is unhealthy and is liable to cause you more grief.  It's already causing Ellie grief.", "If this was working out for you, you wouldn\u2019t be acting like this now. I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s true, you need more help than whatever you\u2019re getting now, and now your daughter probably needs counseling to process this because your method backfired spectacularly. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, but grief can really corrupt people and it\u2019s showing now that you yelled at your daughter for putting two and two together. She\u2019s a child, and you blew up on her all because you couldn\u2019t handle it. I have to say YTA for that part.\n\nEDIT: YTA X100 for this comment\n\n\u201cI have healed as much as I ever will and she has nothing to heal from\u201d\n\nOmfg. You just dismissed your own daughter\u2019s feelings over this revelation like she just scraped her knee on the sidewalk or something. You\u2019re a monster and this realy shifted judgement from a soft asshole to a huge one.", "Very gentle YTA. Jason was your son, but Ellie is also your daughter. I understand grief and how painful it can be, and you didn't have a really healthy way of handling the fact that he was gone. Ellie had a half brother, and very likely may be an aunt to a child in Scotland. I'm not saying she deserved to know, but when another human being is hurt by something it's good to get to the bottom of why instead of lashing out about your hurt first.\n\nEdit: name correction", "I'd like to go N A H because you're obviously still grieving your son, but your daughter has a right to know she had a brother who died before she was born, and may have family in Scotland. You shouldn't have yelled at her. So, very soft YTA - please let you and Ellie go talk to a family therapist about this.", "Grief is a very tricky thing and you have the right to bring these things up if and when you are able, in a way that is safe for you. Ellie has the right to know about her family, her brother included. It's all very difficult but now she knows he existed it might be good to know more about him. I think you're just a little bit of an AH for saying he was only yours, because he was his wife's husband, he was your daughter's brother, he was is own person; I think it was a little harsh to say that to her when she is just finding out she had a brother she didn't know about and so is of course upset.\n\nI think family counselling is something that you need to have with your daughter. Good luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: changing my vote to YTA reading your responses to this and other comments through the thread it's clear that you are not taking your daughter's needs into consideration and it isn't clear why you wanted reddit's input if you are telling everyone they're wrong. You've brought up at several points that your daughter is not a replacement but no one said that she was, that was something you brought up and I'm not going to comment further than this really sticks out to me. It's fine if you want to continue to grieve to yourself about your lost son, but your living daughter has found out an emotional bombshell and needs her mom but you can't get over yourself. Greiving doesn't make you an AH, being and AH to your living daughter makes you the AH.", "YTA reading through tour comments is painful. You keep repeating the same idea that not talking about your son \"works for you \" and stating therapy and talking about it yourself won't help you. But\n You are not doing all right. I'm going to say it again. You are not all right. If it's been this long since his death and the idea of talking about him to his sister who is  YES INDEED HIS SIBLING despite for some reason doubling down over and over that because she didn't know him she has no right to know about him, is something you cannot do without this kind of reaction you have not processed it or ever dealt with it in a healthy way. Does there need to be pictures and shrines ? No. Does erasing his existence from this world so you can just never think about it really help you or your daughter in any way? I'm going to say no as well. I know you keep saying no to it but from a mental health standpoint I do truly wish you'd go and see someone to work through this with your daughter* and really discuss it with her and your memories. I cannot believe there are no happy memories, \nno milestones, no events that can be shared with his sister. I understand being overwhelmed and heartbroken but my god do you think your son would have wanted to be so utterly forgotten? To have no one know about him, his life, his accomplishments, his dreams? \n  \nAnd I'm not saying you'll ever be over/past your son's passing (which btw I'm very very sorry for there are no words that adequately say how sorry I am for that kind of loss) or that the pain will ever go away. But you are not responding to this in any healthy manner. \n\nHe was your son. But he was also your daughter's brother regardless of if she knew him. As someone rightly pointed out in other comments I guarantee she's thinking things like \"if something happens to me mom is going to make it like I never existed\" and I'd say she'd be right to those fears. Talk to your daughter about her brother. Tell her his favorite things, the places he liked to go, the friends his used to have.  Do not put him out of existence or ruin a relationship with your daughter.", "NAH.  You walled up a part of yourself that was too painful to deal with - maybe not the best approach, but we all have our emotional defenses.  But your daughter's reaction is just as reasonable, if not more so. You need to accept two things now: 1) Not telling your daughter about Jason hurt her deeply, and 2) The secret is out, so you need to talk about it.  It may take a long time for a 15-year-old to understand and empathize with the emotional complexity of your loss, but as the parent you have to help her navigate the revelation that a huge and significant portion of her mother's life was kept from her, making her feel like she doesn't truly know her own mother.\n\nI cannot recommend family therapy enough, here. It will help.", "YTA for yelling at your daughter when she discovered you had a son. She's 15! What an absolutely terrible way to treat your CHILD! Sit down and TALK to her. If you can't talk to the people closest to you about your SON who was the center of your universe for 22 years, you need a different therapist because the one you have isn't doing you any favors.", "A very gentle YTA.\n\nIt's going to take her some time to understand where you're coming from here, and that's going to take a conversation.  And before that happens, you need to think about where *she's* coming from, too.  Because you're the parent and she's still learning to navigate things.\n\nTo her, she just found out that you hid over 22 years of history from her - and no, she doesn't understand exactly why.  There was an entire person who was her brother who from her perspective was just...erased.  *Nobody* in her life ever acknowledged the existence of this entire person who lived for 22 years.\n\nRight now, she feels like she doesn't really know her mother.  Right now, she's been confronted with issues of young mortality, and may also be thinking about what you'd do if anything ever happened to *her.*  She may not just feel (whether justified or not) like you've in some way betrayed her, but also like you've betrayed your son.  She may think he wouldn't want to have been hidden away.\n\nAnd she may just want to know *who he was.*  This person who was such a big part of your life and your heart.\n\nShe's a kid, who doesn't know where you're coming from, because you haven't communicated with her except to yell at her that she has no right to know *anything* about him.\n\nThe fact is, though you never intended for her to know, she *does* now and she can't unknow it.  You need to deal with the fallout of that.\n\nReally, I don't think this *is* working for you anymore.", "Ugh I don\u2019t think this was the right sub for your post. I\u2019m so sorry about your loss and everything you\u2019ve felt. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s an asshole", "Well you definitely shouldn't have laid claim to him as only yours since he is her brother, however you are entitled to your feelings same as her. Thing is, a conversation needs to happen so she can know why it's so hard for you to talk about and why. Open the door for her to know about the brother she never got to meet and be open about how it makes you feel talking about it. It can be therapeutic for you both. I've been in a similar situation and it was hard for my kids for a bit but they understand better now", "Sorry but YTA, the grief of losing someone especially a child never goes away. However, you yelling at your daughter because you can't handle it, is wrong. You need a new therapist or psychiatrist because your lashing out at a teen is not healthy.\n\nAlso understand from her perspective she is at a major milestone age where hormones and emotions are over running her life. To think you were an only child and had no siblings of any kind and then to suddenly find out is a bit of a blow.", "Politely as possible, YTA\n\nYour choices to completely erase your deceased son from your life are your choices. And it makes sense that you are still grieving, and as you said in your own way, which isnt that healthy, but again your choice. \n\nYou didn't conceal him enough though and your daughter found out. She has a right to know that she had a brother, that she had a sibling. And I can understand how she feels a part of her is missing. While I dont have a deceased sibling (That I know of), I don't converse with my dad at all, he cut himself out of my life, so I dont know how many siblings I have in reality or even much about his side of the family. I had to do ancestry DNA to find it out. \n\nEllie was probably going to find out sooner or later and she deserved to know, even if it is hard to talk about. You could have even asked Max to help you break it to her. Also there was no reason to yell at her that she, essentially doesn't have a right to know. That reaction alone shows that you should go to therapy.", "Very soft YTA\n\nHe's was her blood. He (as you've said) would be her brother if her was still alive. You daughter also should know because out thier she has a niece/nephew she would be related to due to her brother.\n\nYou cant gatekeep him, she does have every right to know. What you've done isn't healthy and you are being awful to your daughter.", "NAH\n\nOf course everyone is all emotional right now. Give it some time.\n\nBut she's definitely going to want to know about her brother. If you can't talk about it you can't talk about it, but you should at least try. Otherwise she's going to be rightfully pissed.", "NAH - you're not an asshole for what you did, but your daughter does have a right to be upset about having part of her family hidden from her. That's a brother she never knew, that she might want to know things about. It must be very sensitive and I'm sorry for your pain, but now it's time for both of you to apologise and talk things out.\n\nEdited to fix spelling error", "Super soft YTA.  No judgement OP, and I know how time can get away from us.  One moment you're probably thinking \"Well, i'll tell her if she finds out\" and the next moment she's 15 and how are you supposed to break that news, especially when it is so difficult to talk about?  \n\nYour daughter does have a right to know about her brother and about your struggle in coping with it.  It helped shape who you are, and she wants to know what made you the woman you are today.  You should sit down with your daughter and explain that you were not trying to keep things from her, that it was just too painful to talk about.  I'm sure if you were in her position you would want the same.  Good luck OP!", "NTA. I lost my son 13 years ago, he was 20.  I share your pain.  Everyone handles grief in their own way.  You chose to hide and keep it to yourself.   Your daughter shouldn't have yelled at you but she's 14 and in shock, that's how they react.\n\nJason is no longer just yours and you need to figure this out.  Have you gone to grief counseling?  Would you consider telling Ellie more about him?  Yes, I know how much it hurts but in my reality I never want Matthew's name to be forgotten.  You may find some comfort in this.  Sending love and strength.", "YTA mostly to yourself. You could\u2019ve avoided all of this by gently telling her when she was younger that she had a big brother that you loved very much who has passed on.

You kept this secret long enough trying to protect yourself. Let it out. Trust your family. Trust your daughter she is 15. She deserves your trust if you ever expect to implicitly trust you. Don't let the memory of your son be what kills all hope of a real bond and trust with his sister.", "NTA but let me explain - You were not prepared for her to come baring in and demanding answers to something so deeply tucked away inside your heart that it didn't ever occur to you that while it hurts so gd much - sharing him with your daughter would be something Jason would have wanted. \n\nYou had some trauma not only over the loss of your son, but over the loss Amber- who has your grand baby that you are not allowed to see...hear from or know of... I am so so sorry this happened to you. Because this happened and Amber set this tone of - Go away forever - you kind of hid this entire tragic story away.\n\nYou screaming at your daughter and saying he's only yours actually makes sense since in that moment you were only reacting to her demanding an answer to why the heck haven't you ever brought him up before... but it doesn't make it right.\n\nI still don't think you are the ah but you do need to take your daughter to where you have all his things in storage and open up to her about this - maybe be assisted by a therapist?? That's up to you both... but please ask for forgiveness from her for reacting that way. You should not except an apology from her since she is just a child but you can tell her why you kept it a secret. \n\nAs sad as your story is - this is a bonding moment that you both can have by sharing him and his memories with each other - this made me cry so much and I hope - truly that you and your daughter work it out - it would be so beautiful and a happy ending - please also be gentle on yourself as you also need to heal and your 1 bad reaction doesn't make you a monster - it makes you human.", "While I have sympathy, YTA.  Your daughter mostly likely feels shocked and possibly deceived, don\u2019t let this destroy your relationship. \n\nSit her down, answer some questions and let her know that you weren\u2019t trying to hide information, you were trying to figure out how to continue life without your son and did what you could at the time. \n\nI hope you are able to find peace", "YTA, a lie of omission is still a lie you've told your daughter daily for 15 years.", "NAH it was an emotional moment nobody was expecting or prepared for.

Which she found out about by poking through boxes that were tucked away in the attic. Wow, her mom has a *past*, an actual complicated existence before she was even born. \n\nNTA and I want to suggest you get on some DNA registries.

You've been through something incredibly difficult, and everyone deserves to handle their grief in their own way. It's understandable that Ellie is upset she never knew she had an older brother, and she's 15 so she's taking it out on you, but you didn't hide it to upset her.

Your reaction was over the top but I can't call you an asshole for an emotional reaction.

I didn't understand it at the time but I think his mother made the right choice, she must have seen my weaknesses before I could. His son deserves happiness and he can't get that from me. It's just better this way and he's an adult now, the fact that he hasn't contacted us means he might understand that.", "Mom needs more therapy.

You\u2019re wrong.", "You\u2019re creating so much unnecessary and unfair grief for your daughter. \n\nMy mother had an affair child between myself and my youngest sister. \n\nOne day we all found out, it was traumatizing, and caused so many issues. I already had a horrible and strained relationship with my mother and siblings. My given away sister was dragged in all sorts of directions and imploded. \n\nI speak to none of them now. Everyone got hurt. It was horrible. You don\u2019t get to own people and traumatize your daughter because you cannot learn to function with this reality.

I still have a connection to him along with a few pictures and some stories.", "I don't have an answer. But I have my story. \n\nMy own mom, through her issues, made the deliberate decision to remove herself from extended family.  She had her own issues and demons. She even alienated her in laws (dads side).\n\nShe's dead now. While I don't feel incomplete as a person, I know that I will never have a relationship with my family that's akin to all my friends who grew up with cousins, uncles, and aunts. To me - family is no more than acquaintances. Mom sort of soured a ton of those relationships. She greatly abused and manipulated them. So they're hesitant to know me. I get it.\n\nEven my own partner has these people surrounding him who he can call on a whim and share a conversation. All relatives who have some shared childhood memories with him. \n\nI don't resent. I know this is my reality. But I also know this stemmed from my mom's decisions before I was born. And I know that if she was a different person who made different decisions, my childhood could have been different. \n\nI also know that if I have children someday, they won't have the same network of family on my side, as they would on my partner's side. I have plenty of friends. I have my partner's family. Yet...I know it's not the same. \n\nAlso, I know my heritage in a very academic sense. Because it was only my mom who shared it with me, I don't feel a connection to where my ancestors came from.  I don't have the traditions. Other than what I've read. I don't have the memories. I don't have the connection even as I see pictures of relatives who look like me. I feel removed. I have been to therapy. I'm happy with myself and my life. But I'm aware that I'm disconnected to what came before me.", "This was a pretty big secret to keep from the daughter. I'd imagine it would be hard to grow up an only child and then learn that they used to have a brother. She's a teenager and she just  learned that her mom had a whole different life that she purposely kept hidden, that's upsetting to a kid. \n\nI learned at a young age that I was a twin and that my twin died, I'm 40 now and it still effects me.", "Aside from what other people have mentioned, I reckon if I were in the daughter's position I'd also feel pretty weird imagining that if I were to die my mother would deny my entire existence and wipe all reminders of me.", "THIS IS REAL LIFE! You\u2019re applying it a matter you claim happened in real life. Who the hell cares if you\u2019re on the internet", "Yeah, but it\u2019s how you really feel.

The point is to give you another perspective. \n\nI will give it to you. You have done everything right.

She shouldn\u2019t have feelings of confusion about you erasing instead of embracing Jason\u2019s memory. \n\nSounds like you have this all wrapped up with a bow and I\u2019m not sure why you even asked for others to offer insight.", "That, too!!", "I know you think you can make it clear. But if you don\u2019t talk about him at this point, no amount of reassurance will do. She absolutely will think this and she\u2019ll wonder what else you\u2019re hiding.

You've proven yourself to be a person who erases someone from their life and refuses to talk about them. You've shown her that if she were to pass, you'd act like she never existed. Actions speak louder than words. How could she believe anything you say when you've lied about something for her entire life?", "You are awfully hostile for no good reason. What you're doing and what you've done isn't healthy. You're going to lose alot more is you don't get this under control", "Thats truly a sick twisted way of thinking about it.", "But she knows she had grandparents and they remain part of the family tree. \n\nYou cut Jason\u2019s limb off the family tree. altogether. That\u2019s just so sad. My heart breaks for him. We all know that one day we will cease to be but we will have made an impact and will leave memories behind.  I wonder what Jason would say about this if he was able.", "She needs to talk to you, Max never knew him.  You do need family therapy.  This isn't healthy for you, your husband and your daughter.", ">but I don't think it will do me any good to talk about him\n\nIt's not all about you.  You should be more focused on your daughter and her feelings.  She must feel so betrayed that you kept such a huge thing completely from her.  I realize you've tried to handle your grief the best you could,  but try to look at it from her perspective.  You erased all evidence from your day to day life that he ever existed.  Someone that was so important one moment,  was erased the next.  She might really be wondering if you could do the same with her.  She won't ever get to meet him,  but she could learn about him and get to know him from memories.  People that are important to us deserve to be remembered.", "Yes, actually, I do genealogy research and every direct and indirect ancestor I find is part of my family tree whether they're my eighth great grandparent, or my second cousin, six times removed.", "Time does make a difference you know. \n\nIf William the conqueror was my mother's 1st born child and I was her 2nd  then he's family  absolutely.  And even in your example I would at least still say yes I'm a descendant.\n\nAlso you don't get to define what family means to your 15 year old daughter.

But that love has become tied with pain when it comes to your son.\n\nIt's going to be painful, let your son's child know he's got family where you are. If you don't want to talk to him, let him know about your daughter because she is going to try and reach out to him.\n\nYour choice now is whether you are going to support your daughter reaching out or hide away. Which do you think will be best for her?", "Maybe, but therapy isn't some magic fix that enables you to deal well with random, unexpected reminders of traumatic events. Plus, she's already in therapy/grief counseling.\n\nAt best therapy will/has help identify healthy coping strategies, which might be finding less stressful ways to discuss the topic or setting a boundary around discussing the topic at all.", "Both of them had emotional reactions. They both yelled at each other inappropriately, it was wrong for both of them, and they should both apologize. \n\nIn Ellie's case, she was probably expecting a hidden sibling.

That is such an over exaggeration.", "That's only 13 years ago. Didn't you say your daughter is 15?", "He did nothing wrong. I know that I wouldn't be a healthy presence in his life and that must be why his mother cut me off. She was right to do so because I don't think I would ever be able to stop trying to see my son in him, even if he's completely different. The best thing I can do for his life is stay out of it. And I know it's strange, because I've never thought of my daughter as a replacement, if I had another son, I wouldn't have though of him as one. But I know that I wouldn't be able to see this boy as anything but that and maybe it's because he's from him.", "I know.  OP needs some more therapy here.  If OP is this hostile on reddit I can't imagine how that discussion went with the daughter.   Simple fact is that most people would want to learn about a brother that they never met regardless of OP's notion they are not siblings.  OP can say that over and over as much as they want but obviously the daughter feels otherwise.  The surprise at finding out about this so far after the fact would be shocking to anyone to say the least.", "Max knows enough about him to tell her enough to hopefully satiate her and stop this. I have nothing in my schedule to prevent therapy.", "That isn't a hypothetical.", "If she can find her cousin and reaches out to him when she is 18 or living on her own, then I will support her so long as she respects my wishes to not be a part of his life just as I respected his mother's wishes to stay away.", "So you admit they both had emotional reactions?\n\nSo you\u2019re saying Ellie at 15 should\u2019ve had enough emotional regulation to identify her emotion, and then stop herself from having that reaction?

It\u2019s not unusual for children to feel a strong desire to know their parents\u2019 true story.\n\nNormally, I would say the mourner has carte blanche in deciding how to grieve, but it seems pretty clear from your story that something about how you\u2019re coping with this has really hurt your daughter. I would suggest that you and she, together and separately, might benefit from trying to work out in therapy what\u2019s going on with her reaction and how you two can move forward in a life-affirming way.", "If the foundation is a lie everything built upon it is also suspect.\n\nThink of it this way, if you found out that you husband had never told you about a large part of his past would that not make you doubt the whole relationship?\n\nSame thing.", "She found out you\u2019re trying to hide 22 years of your life, that\u2019s weird at best for her to discover one day.", "This is not OP", "Did Amber tell you that she believed all this?
