It was like love at first sight. We both agreed that we could restore it and gift it to my mother-in-law, whose glass tabletop was scratched beyond recognition.\n\nSo, there we were, admiring this remarkable table when a lady, probably in her 40s, strolled over with her kid. We didn't pay much attention and started snapping pics of the furniture to show my father-in-law later. But now, here's where things get interesting.\n\nThe lady and her kid eventually moved on, and we continued our photography session. Suddenly, out of nowhere, she returned, tears streaming down her face, pointing at my husband and exclaiming, 'That's him!' As we turned to look in the same direction, we saw her with a security guard in tow. She accused my husband of secretly taking pictures of her and claimed he insulted her by photographing her without consent. She insisted that the security check my husband's phone for proof.\n\nOf course, it's not legal to check my husband's phone. We explained to the security guard and the lady that we are a married couple, not interested in taking anyone's photos for obvious reasons, as we are in a monogamous relationship. Both of us were clearly uncomfortable but tried to explain to them. The lady even threatened to call the cops.\n\nStill, this lady remained unconvinced and gave us a dirty look, proceeding to call us 'lying freak!' She still believed my husband was a creep, taking her pictures without permission and even accused him for assault, threatening to sue him. She was convinced that we were some creepy predators.\n\nThat's when my husband decided to make a his move. He casually flipped through his phone, proudly displaying intimate photos of us (don\u2019t came for us, we liked to take videos and photos for our selves pleasure), along with the pictures of the furniture we had taken. We could clearly see her transition from an angry crying face to a face of realization and awkwardness. I proceeded to tell her, \u2018Look, ma'am, you're clearly out of your mind. None of us is interested in you. I'm happily married to my husband, and frankly, we've got better things to do.'\n\nYou can probably guess her reaction - more tears, no apology, screaming at us that we are lying and we are not gay, even resorting to using f slur at us. She then grabbed her son and stormed off.\n\nSo, AITA for telling her off and not handling this situation more maturely? I believe she was in a rough state since she looked distressed.

She accused your husband of assault snd threatened to sue, and when your husband showed proof of the fact that he had only taken pictures of the furniture and not of her she proceeded to show her colors as a homophobic rhymes-with-witch. As you pointed out, it's not even legal for actual cops to search private property (a phone) without a warrant, let alone for /security guards/ to do so. You and your husband tried to handle the situation calmly and maturely, and the woman accusing you escalated the situation.\n\nHilarious that she saw intimate photos of you two together and insisted you're not actually gay--yet hurled the f-slur at you regardless.", "NTA. Reality check: The entire world, including likely that store, is on CCTV and taking her photo without her permission.", "LOL. She wanted to see the pictures, and boy did she see pictures.  You could have been nasty about it, looked her up and down and ask why would you be interested in her, but you took a different route, good for you.  NTA.", "Clearly the lady is an AH. But showing intimate photos without consent is not cool.", "I don't see how showing her pics of you 2 having sex was a flex but if it made you feel better than I guess.", "ESH - she's clearly in the wrong for going overboard, but your husband sucks for showing a stranger explicit content. He could have just shown the pictures of the furniture, but couldn't resist the shock factor the photos would create.", "Not a fan of the shock photos at all, let alone in front of a kid. This woman is obviously mentally ill (or trying to get a payday through a lawsuit).

Her only problem was calling you a slur tbh, everything else was 100% justified until you showed her the furniture pics you took.   \n\n\nim going with ESH because of her slur but if she hadn't said that, you two would be the only assholes here. sexually harassing assholes. like it's fucking weird your defense was \"no we would never take pictures of you because we love each other and you're a gross woman\" like you saying you're a gay couple had any weight to a stranger. then to go and show her nsfw pictures is just creepy and gross (again NOT because it's two men, showing anyone any sexual imagery of anyone when they did not ask to see it is creepy and gross\"", "very important info\n\ndid the child see the pics ? \n\nhow old was the child?", "it would of been clearly Nta if it wasnt for you potentially showing a minor, porn.

On each occasion it was by a group of men - not singular, always at least two. It's disgusting. Really, truly, disgusting. The way in which some men feel entitled to objectify women while we are going about our everyday business revolts me to my core. Making comments, taking pictures. Do men even realize how unsafe women are often made to feel when doing simple, mundane tasks?\n\nThat women's reaction was really extreme, I wonder how many times she's been made to feel unsafe while conducting her regular business in public prior to this. Most women reacting like this aren't crazy, they are traumatized.\n\nAlso just fyi a lot of pervs claim to be gay when caught. My personal favorite incident of sexual harassment was when my house mates brother claimed to be gay and asked me for a hug and when I gave him the hug he grabbed both my ass cheeks and squeezed, then told all the guys in our living room who all laughed.

The fact that AFTER it was well established that you were gay, and she then used the F word, I say fuck her", "NTA in the slightest. She can cry all she wants.

This may sound unfamiliar to you depending on your culture but it's extremely common in some parts of the world. \nA 16 yo gets rape threats from a supposedly 'good kid' at school, and in the same breath gets told no one will believe her if she chooses to escalate. \n\nThis is just the experience of children, girls and women get harassed for simply existing, for daring to walk down the street or buy groceries. Every single day. And so many people mentioned men taking photos, that's so common, so so common, and these men always work in pairs or groups. \n\nThis is the way society treats women, and terrified traumatised women will have reactions. Yes, people can bleat about 'not all men' all they want, but if it's not men doing it, it's men standing by and doing nothing,  it's men trivializing these situations,  it's men that are willfully unaware and chooses to remain that way. \n\nIf people learn to do better, then everyone gets treated better, regardless of the genitelia they posses.\n\nP.s.
