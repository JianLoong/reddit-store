{"id": 28546, "submission_id": "173jt9s", "title": "AITA for not wanting to babysit for my sister anymore?", "selftext": "So I (18F) have been babysitting for my sister (30F) since I was 15. I first agreed because my sister was going through some financial trouble. She was getting divorced from her dickhead husband, quit her job, and moving. So I was more than happy to help out. \n\nAt first it was fine, but I slowly realized how difficult it was to babysit two young kids and do school. I am homeschooled, so I do my work on a computer, which was fine at first, but it became increasingly harder when I had to tend to a 2 year old and a 4 year old. I started falling behind in school and having all F\u2019s. \n\nSee I was always a straight A student, so having F\u2019s devastated me. I was on top of my grades, mostly because the first time I had a B my mother said, \u201cYou should be disappointed in yourself.\u201d And I craved my parents approval, so seeing an F on my report card made me want to vomit. \n\nSummers weren\u2019t any better. I was stuck at home. I couldn\u2019t hang out with friends, go places, or get a summer job. Basically be a teenager.\n\nBecause of all this, my anxiety and depression got worse, and slowly I developed an eating disorder (something I\u2019m still recovering from today). So I tried to ask my sister to get a babysitter. Keyword TRIED. She accused me of not caring for her kids and being selfish because I knew she needed my help and I didn\u2019t want to. I felt guilty and like a piece of shit so I continued babysitting.\n\nFor the past two years, my sister and I\u2019s relationship was strained.\n\n\nWell fast forward to the present, my sister is moved into her own house with her boyfriend. She has a better paying job and is A LOT more comfortable. She is able to spend money on expensive purses and trips with her best friend. So I figured it was time to ask if she could find a babysitter. I\u2019m in my senior year, broke as hell, and still stuck at home with two kids. And each time I mentioned it I got the same answer. \u201cI don\u2019t have the money.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll just quit my job then\u201d or something else to make me feel like a shitty person. \n\nI\u2019ve had enough, but I don\u2019t want to start a fight with her. But I also don\u2019t want her to keep walking all over me. I feel like TA for not wanting to babysit anymore, but it\u2019s causing me a lot of stress. I\u2019m stuck.\nAITA??\n\nEdit: I just wanna thank everyone for all the advice! Some were very blunt but I needed it! I will talk with my parents and sister! I will make sure to stand my ground!", "created_utc": 1696828437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173jt9s/aita_for_not_wanting_to_babysit_for_my_sister/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not a shitty person because you don't want to watch someone else's kids, especially at the detriment of your education. Also, if she can afford expensive purses and trips with her friends, she can afford a babysitter or daycare of some sort.\n\nWhere are your parents in all of this?", "Tell her you are no longer available. She is manipulative and it's working. She has taken advantage of you and she's using you. Tell her you're not available to her any more and then don't answer your phone or texts when she makes demands, block her if she gets rude, and let her know that she's an ungrateful asshole when she tells you that you don't care for her kids. BTW, they are HER kids so she's the one who should be making the arrangements, not guilting you into it. Please look out for yourself. You are not a shitty person. You've been abused. You are not stuck. All you have to do is decide that you would rather put you first for once and let her deal with her own problems. You are not her personal servant. NTA", "It seems like she doesn't want to spend her extra money because you are available to do the job. My advice would be to perhaps find a regular job that your parents would support. This way, you could have an excuse and occupy your time while earning some extra money.", "Definitely NTA, but your sister and parents are. Your parents can\u2019t come down on you for a change of grades and then be dissatisfied when you want to stop doing the thing that\u2019s hurting your grades in the first place? You should have a talk with you family about next steps, you\u2019re 18 now so what happens if you want to go to college, enter a career path for yourself, or is your destiny solely being your sisters servant??", "NTA.  The simplest solution is to just not be home when she drops the kids off, since they don't live in the same place you do.  Go take walk, hide at the library, anywhere, it doesn't matter.  Just don't be home.  Find a job.  You don't need permission because you are 18.    Be at home as little as possible and save your money to leave.  Don't open a bank account with a parent on it.", "NTA\n\nSweetheart... Those aren't YOUR kids. You didn't choose to bring them into this world, their mother did. She should be caring for them, NOT YOU.", "The fact that she jumped to guilting you instead of asking why you didn\u2019t want to do it anymore tells you everything you need to know in my opinion. She Dosent deserve an explanation after that. But, just based off this post, I know you are nicer than I lol. Explain to her everything in this post the next time you ask her you don\u2019t want to do this anymore. You are being taken advantage of. Simple as that.", "NTA it ia your choise", "NTA\n\nFocus on your studies. Say no.", "NTA - She and your parents are really taking advantage of you. The only thing I've seen work in other posts are when people say no and then threaten to call CPS if they still leave the kids. I think you're too sweet to do this, but you have to say no and be stern or find a way to just not be there when you know she's going to drop the kids off. Start being irresponsible.", "Absolutely NTA. You need to be out with friends, engaging in hobbies, and focused on school like other people your age. It's not like you gave birth at a young age to children that are your sole responsibility. They aren't your kids, and you've done more than enough to help you sister out. Don't let her make you feel bad for drawing a line!", "NTA\nStart charging", " NO, you\u2019re not stuck. You\u2019re letting yourself act that way, but you\u2019re not. Your grades suffered, you have zero social life, youre depressed and developed an eating disorder, ffs. Your sister DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. She cares about saving money on a sitter, manipulating you, getting someone else to raise her kids, and now fancy lipstick and purses. Give her one week, not one month, one week to find daycare. She will use her old tactics to try to get you to keep watching her kids. Say no no no no. Then immediately call a therapist, because you could use help setting boundaries.

Or other family members and relatives can volunteer.\n\nShe is going on trips and is buying expensive items, so she has options.\"\n\nIt's unfortunate that you're stuck babysitting. Best you can do is get whatever evidence you can that you're being forced to babysit ie text messages or emails, and tell a school teacher or guidance counselor. Otherwise save a copy of your evidence then post on social media. And say you're unavailable...you already can't go anywhere due to babysitting, what are your parents going to do, ground you for caring about your education? If this was your parents forcing you to take care of your siblings this would be parentification.\n\nFunny how your parents are saying **you're** \"unreasonable\" but I bet they haven't done much babysitting for your sister and they're ignoring that your school is suffering because of it?\n\nAnd the sister has some nerve calling **you** selfish when she is forcing off parenting to their younger sibling and making them sacrifice your education when she can afford to get them daycare or a proper babysitter.\n\nSa", "In that case, I think you just need to have a serious conversation with your parents about this. I assume they feel sorry for your sister because her situation is shaky (maybe???).  You help your sister, but does she help you? Financialy for example in exchange for babysitting", "Plus I think your parents see you as \"the little one\". By your description they are really manipulative and strict. Get only good grades, help your sister, etc etc. Maybe the problem is your parents", "Good for you! \ud83d\ude03 family is hard! What your sister has done is absolutely wrong on every level. Consider going low/no contact with her, at least until the dust settles. Hang in there. \u2764\ufe0f"]}
