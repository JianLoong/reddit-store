I first agreed because my sister was going through some financial trouble. She was getting divorced from her dickhead husband, quit her job, and moving. So I was more than happy to help out. \n\nAt first it was fine, but I slowly realized how difficult it was to babysit two young kids and do school. I am homeschooled, so I do my work on a computer, which was fine at first, but it became increasingly harder when I had to tend to a 2 year old and a 4 year old. I started falling behind in school and having all F\u2019s. \n\nSee I was always a straight A student, so having F\u2019s devastated me. I was on top of my grades, mostly because the first time I had a B my mother said, \u201cYou should be disappointed in yourself.\u201d And I craved my parents approval, so seeing an F on my report card made me want to vomit. \n\nSummers weren\u2019t any better. I was stuck at home. I couldn\u2019t hang out with friends, go places, or get a summer job. Basically be a teenager.\n\nBecause of all this, my anxiety and depression got worse, and slowly I developed an eating disorder (something I\u2019m still recovering from today). So I tried to ask my sister to get a babysitter. Keyword TRIED. She accused me of not caring for her kids and being selfish because I knew she needed my help and I didn\u2019t want to. I felt guilty and like a piece of shit so I continued babysitting.\n\nFor the past two years, my sister and I\u2019s relationship was strained.\n\n\nWell fast forward to the present, my sister is moved into her own house with her boyfriend. She has a better paying job and is A LOT more comfortable. She is able to spend money on expensive purses and trips with her best friend. So I figured it was time to ask if she could find a babysitter. I\u2019m in my senior year, broke as hell, and still stuck at home with two kids. And each time I mentioned it I got the same answer. \u201cI don\u2019t have the money.\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll just quit my job then\u201d or something else to make me feel like a shitty person. \n\nI\u2019ve had enough, but I don\u2019t want to start a fight with her. But I also don\u2019t want her to keep walking all over me. I feel like TA for not wanting to babysit anymore, but it\u2019s causing me a lot of stress. I\u2019m stuck.\nAITA??\n\nEdit: I just wanna thank everyone for all the advice! Some were very blunt but I needed it! I will talk with my parents and sister! I will make sure to stand my ground!\n\nEdit #2: I should\u2019ve mentioned this, which was dumb of me, but I have said flat out no, but it hasn\u2019t really stuck. but i am becoming more stern!\n\nSmall update: I talked to my mother and it didn\u2019t far. Long story short, she depends on me and I said I wanted to babysit (in the beginning before my grades and mental health start tanking) I talk to my dad for about a second before he walked away.

Best you can do is get whatever evidence you can that you're being forced to babysit ie text messages or emails, and tell a school teacher or guidance counselor. Otherwise save a copy of your evidence then post on social media. And say you're unavailable...you already can't go anywhere due to babysitting, what are your parents going to do, ground you for caring about your education? If this was your parents forcing you to take care of your siblings this would be parentification.\n\nFunny how your parents are saying **you're** \"unreasonable\" but I bet they haven't done much babysitting for your sister and they're ignoring that your school is suffering because of it?\n\nAnd the sister has some nerve calling **you** selfish when she is forcing off parenting to their younger sibling and making them sacrifice your education when she can afford to get them daycare or a proper babysitter.\n\nSa", "In that case, I think you just need to have a serious conversation with your parents about this. I assume they feel sorry for your sister because her situation is shaky (maybe???).  You help your sister, but does she help you?

Get only good grades, help your sister, etc etc. Maybe the problem is your parents", "Good for you! \ud83d\ude03 family is hard! What your sister has done is absolutely wrong on every level.

This works great for me. Ok bye\"\n\nThere is a big difference between babysitting and providing full time child care. You wer doing the later. And it sounds like it was unpaid. \n\nJust say no. Simple as that. You don't need to give a reason why, or hear a plea from her. Her trying to manipulate you by saying she can't afford it or she will quit her job are her problems. It is not on you to solve them for her.", "NTA but wake up Cinderella, it's up to you to say NO and not doing it for real. Go to the library, stay at school longer, or find a way to move out.

A whole lot of babysits just evaporated or went to mom(which was another problem on it's own). \nSuddenly I had weekends back, no more having to sleep over to feed the kids breakfast, no more hanging in their house till 3 in the morning, or having to get up at 5 to get to their house on time.\nThey could all do it without me.\nIt went from 4-5 babysits a week to 1 or 2 a month and I got paid. If I didn't get paid I would refuse to babysit at all next time until I was paid for the last one. \n\nThey did try to dump their kids with me a few times. And I responded by charging regular amount per hour and an emergency fee.\n\nYou've been babysitting for 3 years. That is more than loyalty enough. The sister could have dealt with the babysitting issue a long time ago. She just doesn't because you are easy and free. Everything else has rules and prices to follow. You don't.\n\nYour parents are also complicit in this. I'd talk to them first. Frame it as the babysitting getting in the way of academic succes. If you have your parents support on this it will go way easier.\n\nIf they don't give you support it's time to get a rebellious streak and just fill your days with responsibilities other than babysitting. Let them pick up the slack. If they drop the kids with you just drop them straight back with your parents.

Parentification is abuse. You are being abused by your sister and your parents.\n\nFirmly state that you will not watch the children ever again, under any circumstances. If they are left with you, you will immediately call the police and CPS for child abandonment. This may sound harsh, but what they're doing to you is worse.

You have to do it yourself.", "NTA", "Tell her you\u2019re no longer available, and take yourself out of the house during the hours you would normally babysit.

What should sister do with kids and can she afford the solution is irrelevant to OP. The sister and parents can figure that out but OP is not a parent. It\u2019s inappropriate to suggest a babysitter in my opinion (because it\u2019s sister\u2019s job to figure out the solutions).

Walk down the road. Disappear down the back paddock, or into the woods.\n\nHank the deep throater is doing anything but trying their best", "Is she paying you for watching the kids?? Because if she isnt that's even worse!!!", "Don\u2019t you have someone else you can move in with ? I think the best thing for you would be to get out of the toxic house. They have abused you long enough\u2026 I don\u2019t think you realise how much this will likely affect your whole life going forward. You deserve better than this, these are not your children they are your sisters children and she needs to take responsibility for them. You need to put on your big girl panties and get out and ready to advocate for yourself! We also need an update x", "nope. i have not been paid. And i felt guilty asking for payment because I felt like I was being greedy.", "OK hank the deep throater", "i thought i was so funny for picking that user :/"]}
