We had asked our son, (18m) if he wanted to go, but he said \u201cno\u201d with no feeling in his voice while playing his games. He had just turned 18 3 months ago and has already been acting different. We believed he would be able to handle the house on his own, as he is now an adult and will need to take care of these responsibilities later. I have tought him the basics before, and I have been teaching him more since he turned 16 and wanted to start driving. He knows how to take care of our house, and is amazing at it, so I let him stay home alone. We texted him when we arrived at the airport, when we boarded, and when we got in the air. And he responded with each time was \u201cOk,love you.\u201d Basic response, but maybe he\u2019s busy? He has his own room downstairs where he usually stays, so I didn\u2019t have to worry about a mess. Well, week passes, we check up on him 5 times a day, and we get home after the week. He is upstairs grabbing food when we walk in, and we notice he is sweaty (out of the shower or after a run I assume) he looks at us, and says \u201cI didn\u2019t know you guys would be home so early\u201d with a sort of worried look on his face. We start to get suspicious, but we don\u2019t mind and hug him tightly. We then head to our room, and my jaw drops wide open. Our sheets and bed are a mess, there are wet stains EVERYWHERE, and our window is wide open, (our window is never open unless necessary) and it smells of sweat. I drop my luggage and look around at the bed, then I turn to my husband and stare at him with shock. I\u2019m a HUGE germaphobe, but my husband goes up to the bed and gets close, examining the stains and what it might be. We then notice the USED condom that is sitting on our floor.. I immediately run out of my room and go to my son. He\u2019s still upstairs and he looks at me, knowing he messed up. I start screaming at him loudly and make sure he knows what he did is wrong. I send him down to his room and start crying to my husband because it is just down right disgusting. My son TEXTED me a day later \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d and hasn\u2019t been upstairs since. I\u2019m utterly disgusted and disappointed, but I guess he wanted to make his own choices as an adult now. I don\u2019t know if it was wrong that I yelled at him, but me and my husband were able to clean up the mess and get rid of our sheets. We are getting new ones soon and deep cleaned our mattress and switched  out our pillows.", "created_utc": 1700377415, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yrcrw/aita_for_yelling_at_my_now_adult_son_after/", "score": 700, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t get the TA posts. He has his own bed and used yours without your consent. One of the posts said \u201cthat\u2019s how your son conceived so you\u2019re overreacting\u201d. This argument makes no sense. You are allowed to do whatever you want in your own bed. That doesn\u2019t mean your son has consent to use YOUR bed for sex. Your feelings are valid. Maybe just cleaning the sheets would be enough for me, but there is no right answer when it comes to your comfort, that\u2019s a personal choice. Your son embarrassed himself. Make him pay for the new sheets. His embarrassment and money should be enough punishment.\n\nEdit: don\u2019t call your son 5x/day, leave him alone as little. You say he\u2019s an adult but don\u2019t treat him as one. He made a stupid mistake (because he\u2019s still a developing adult), sure, but don\u2019t continue to treat him like a kid.", "NTA. He can have all the sex he wants in his own room, but it is extremely disrespectful to do that in your room on your bed. And to not even properly apologize makes it worse.", "For all these people saying Y T A, yea hell no. He\u2019s 18 years old with his own room in the house. To do it in the parents room is disturbing and not clean up after is even more so. Just ain\u2019t right. I\u2019d be livid.", "NTA for getting mad at him. Completely disrespectful of him to be using your room for sex.  Checking up on an 18 yo 5 times a day however is highly unusual, you obviously either don\u2019t trust him, or think he is too immature/irresponsible to be left alone \u2026 and it appears your fears may be founded.", "Everyone saying that YTA are 18 year old boys doing disgusting things. That is the only explanation. If my son have sex in my bed and didn't clean it up, I'd put the fear of god into him. NTA", "Everyone who is saying you\u2019re TA is a horny freak with 0 boundaries. You are NTA, and honestly I think you\u2019re too easy on him. Yelling at him isn\u2019t really an appropriate consequence for bonking in your bed. If anyone bonked in my bed \u2014 even if they cleaned up \u2014 I\u2019d still be pissed.", "NTA I would lose my shit if anyone used my bed while I was away when they have a perfectly good bed of their own. The practical stalking of the man while you were away was totally unnecessary and weird and made no difference to the outcome but that\u2019s a question for another time maybe.", "Naw, supper disgusting! I\u2019m sorry his little feelings were hurt - NTA, sometimes people are justified getting mad and yelling. F the haters", "NTA assuming son has a perfectly good bed in his room. I wonder why he did it? Weird kink? Or OPs room was nicer/cleaner to inpress his sex buddy?", "Your son is so gross on so many levels", "NTA\n\nWhether 5 times a day is too many or not is neither here nor there. It\u2019s irrelevant to the issue of whether or not you\u2019re the A for being grossed out by your son having sex in your bed and not even bothering to clean up the evidence. And the answer is no. Yeah you shouted. Sometimes people shout when they are super upset and given you\u2019re a germaphobe, I can see why you\u2019d be so distressed. Frankly it\u2019d be gross of him regardless, but I assume he knows how you feel about germs, in which case it was even more awful behaviour.\n\nBut I think it wouldn\u2019t hurt to apologise for shouting, since he apologised for his behaviour (perhaps by text because of his shame? Not necessarily a disrespectful or careless action) If you\u2019re both willing to talk it through (possibly without too much actual detail!) you\u2019ll be better off for it.\n\nJust because you\u2019re NTA doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t reach out and mend things anyway.", "NTA -- this **is** disgusting.\n\nBut\n\n>me and my husband were able to clean up the mess and get rid of our sheets.

I also doubt it was the only room he had sex in whilst you were gone. I know my step son used every room in the house when he house and dog sat for us. But he at least tried to clean up (our bedsheets were changed for fresh ones, as were the ones in both the other bedrooms) - as I expect your son would have tried to also. \n\nYour germaphobia shouldn't be your son's problem, but equally he should have respected your space.\n\n(And no, I'm not an 18 year old boy. Quite the opposite)", "Every part of your reaction seems fair and normal to me except the part about throwing out you bed sheets and deep cleaning your mattress. Does anyone else think this is messed up and over the top weird?\n\nYou do realize that anytime you stay at a hotel the the sheets you sleep in and the bed have probably had people having sex on them? So it\u2019s weird that you\u2019d throw your personal bedding away because you son had sex on them.", "NTA. This is fucking rude and gross. Who does that to someone else\u2019s bed?", "NTA for being angry as hell at your son for having sex in your bed.  Slightly crazy for deep cleaning the bed and getting new pillows, definitely overbearing calling five times a day.", "YTA\n\nyou checked up on him 5 times a day!!!!! Really! 3 times before you even got on the plane.\n\nYes he messed up, yes he obviously had a girl over. So what! Yes he should have laundered the bedding and put on a fresh set, before you got home. You threw out perfectly good sheets rather than launder them, and paid for your mattress to be deep cleaned. You must have money to burn, but then again you probably have if you can afford a week in Dubai\n\nWas the rest of the house clean and tidy, I suspect it was, and he has apologised.\n\nYou have gone over the top, and over reacted.", "You sound like a control freak. Who checks up on their 18-year-old son 5 TIMES A DAY while on vacation? I was on a trip with a friend like that, once. Parents wanted to call her every 2 hours to ask where we'd been. I finally told her to just switch off her phone. Because wanting to know where your adult child is and what they are doing every minute of every day? That's just ridiculous. You have work to do. On yourself, in case that wasn't clear. \n\nThat being said: your son should have not used your bed. He probably knew beforehand you'd freak the hell out about it. \n\nESH", "For me this is an easy ESH. \n\nWhat he did was stupid, but i kinda get it. He wanted to impress some person with the master bedroom, which was clean and put together vs his stinky boy bedroom. He wanted to feel like the adult in the house, so of course that means staying in the master suite. He should have known better but apparently not.\n\nI think OP went a bit volcanic though. Just clean the sheets a couple of time in hot water. No need to throw them away. And deep cleaning the mattress. I mean unless he shit and pissed all over everything and if this was a girl on her cycle that left behind some stains, its just fuck juice on bed sheets. Yea he could have had a marathon session, cleaned the sheets and they would have never been the wiser. \n\nOP calls him an adult but then says \"we check up on him 5 times a day,\" No wonder he is acting the way he is. Also to just expect him to change his behavior between 17 and 18 is a bit or a ridiculous though. So he turns 18 and now is just supposed to know every there is about being an adult. Most people dont fully mature until around the age of 25. You coddled him and then expected him to act like an adult. You expected you precious little boy not to do something stupid just because he is now an adult. The naivety you have is glaring. You obviously didnt teach him enough about boundaries and didnt set the proper expectations you had regarding your home. Lesson learned and now you know that just because a person is 18 doesnt mean they are a mature adult", "ESH, but mostly you, \n\nYour boy wanted to stay back to get laid lol. I\u2019ve been 18 before, I know what that\u2019s like. Apparently you haven\u2019t been? You are being absolutely idiotic about it. Just say \u201cat least you wore a condom\u2026now we\u2019re going out for a bit, please clean the fuck up now.\u201d There\u2019s no need to yell. Hes embarrassed already. \n\nHe\u2019s an AH for using his parents bed for it. I mean\u2026we\u2019ve all fucked in shady spots, but that\u2019s just ew imo. \n\nYour son is 18. He\u2019s going to fuck just like you did to make him. In case you didn\u2019t know this, your parents also fucked to make you. It\u2019s natural, I promise.", "ESH. You sound overbearing with the amount you checked up on him, and your reaction was over the top - he knows he fucked up, there\u2019s no need to keep hammering the point. Just make him clean up and tell him to use his own bed next time. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have used his parents\u2019 bed to have sex, that\u2019s just weird.", "YTA. New sheets? Deep cleaning the mattress. How did you people have kid? Immaculate conception. You grossly overreacted, humiliated your son, and ought to apologize.", "NTA. But I mean the kid is 18 yo. He probably was living his dream out doing whatever the hell he wanted to without parental supervision. It\u2019s always better to inform someone beforehand that you\u2019re arriving home early. I hope this is something y\u2019all will laugh over dinner with his spouse some years later lol", "ESH\n\nYour son shouldn\u2019t have used your bedroom and he definitely shouldn\u2019t have left it in such a disgusting state. You did overreact by throwing the sheets away and screaming at him though.", "you checked on him five times a day wow!  i personally think before you left you always treated him like he was a bit of a dummy in just reading your post and i think him having sex in ur bedroom was a bit of an F u to u symbolism.", "ESH.\n\nDo you believe there's something Bob Ross couldn't persuade you to do?

Chill the fuck out.", "Your adult son had sex, happened to be in your bed. Relax.", "YTA-you are also naive and need anger management therapy. It\u2019s the screaming that led to my decision. What he did was disrespectful but I do wonder what his life has been like with you having so many control issues.", "YTA. Kid did what kids do. He had the house for himself for a week and if you found ONE condom and an alarmed son saying you arrived earlier than expected, he was taking excellent care of the house because trust and believe, he used much more than only one.\n\nThe part that made me curious is that you didn't seem to come across whoever was sharing that bed with him.\n\nAlso, for the bed: oldest rule of all: \"if you fuck on it, you're buying it.\"", "Maybe his bed wasn't big enough for 2 people to sleep in. He was hoping to have it all cleaned before they arrived back", "My goodness! He used his parents bed. Not the best choice but he is 18 years old. Teenagers are immature. That is to be expected.

Gosh.\n\nI hope you all talk.", "YTA so your son was cranking it and you shamed him for that? Why don\u2019t you start flicking it and that might calm you the fuck down you silly billy. Your poor son is just trying to relieve tension in his balls ate you\u2019ve added to his problems.", "YTA he had sex in your bed which is stupid but he is 18. You seriously overreacted of all the things that kid could have done when you are gone sex in your bed is pretty tame. I mean seriously do you remember being that age? Also you sent him to his room sounds to me you still treat him like a child well mom he probably acted out because of it.", "Honestly Slight YTA because you did not lock the bedroom door when traveling.", "This is a very good example of bad parenting. First, you had to force him to travel with you. He is not an adult, unlike what you think. He is a teenager and teenagers do stupid stuff. This is how we learn. Trial and error. So, it is very unlikely that he prefers seeing a new culture over being on his own for a few days. Second, really messaging 5 times a day? And you claim that you think he is an adult. This is enforcing your presence on him. Third, feeling sorry for yelling is the summary of your inconsistent behavior against your son. If he is an adult, then he is punished when he makes mistakes. Or if he is a child, then he is guided when he makes a mistake. You try to do both and fail in both.\nYou have to learn that life is not about being right or wrong. Life is about facing consequences. You must punish him, more than yelling, so he can learn the consequences of doing the wrong thing willingly.", "You do want to have something to do with your grandchildren, yes?  Or are you ok with being cut out of your son\u2019s life and the family he will have?   You really need to think about this kinda stuff before you go flying off the handle.  And if you don\u2019t think something like this can happen, there are support groups for parents that have lost their children over stuff less than this.

By mutually agreed upon I mean you all get a say as everyone deserves respect.  I\u2019ll get you started with the first 2 rules:\n\n1. Your son is not to have sex in you and your husband\u2019s private quarters (bedroom and private bathroom if you have one).\n2.

I knew the stain wasn\u2019t there before, so again, I asked my son about it and he said he never went into my room. I look closer, having known about the hanky panky and I immediately knew what the stain was. A se(a)man stain. Me and my husband haven\u2019t done it in a while, so I knew it wasn\u2019t from us.
