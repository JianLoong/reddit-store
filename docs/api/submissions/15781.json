She's ONE. it's ok if you don't feel comfortable leaving her with anyone, let alone someone you have a rocky relationship with and don't trust.", "Question do you think your MIL will harm your baby to spite you? I respect your frustration with your MIL she seems extra but does that really mean your baby shouldn\u2019t have a relationship with her?", "NTA. Listen to your internal mother's intuition - Seriously. \n\nYour mil is clearly a spiteful woman who will never let go of this grudge, ever. If she gets irrationally mad at you again, she may harm the child as revenge (in her mind) against you. It hasn't happened yet, but you're obviously fearful that she will do this as it sounds like she has the capacity and inclination to do so.\n\nOver 90% of child abusers are someone they know, and almost 80% of child kidnappings are done by a family member. Look these statistics up; they are shocking yet accurate. You feel in your gut something is amiss, otherwise you'd have let her be alone with the kid by now. \n\nThe fact that she tried to pull the old Bugs Bunny switcharoo to babysit alone while you and hubby went shopping is super shady. That, along with her manipulating your husband to try to be unsupervised with the baby, is even worse. These are blatant warning signs that you should NOT leave them alone together. Like you said, what does she want to with the child alone versus with you in the room? \n\nBetter safe than sorry...", "You're mil and husband are TA's. Not you.", "NTA. She doesn't need to be alone with your baby. She can bond just fine with you there. If she says she can't, then she is up to no good. Show your husband this thread. MIL sounds awful. I wouldn't leave my baby alone with her either, especially if she has so little respect for you. She will undermind you and try to manipulate your child and husband at every turn. She sounds like a crazy grandma who will try to teach your child to call her mama when you're not listening to show her dominance over you. Hopeful you and your husband can set and enforce boundaries with her or just go NC until she can play nice.", "I'll go NAH, but unless you are fearing your MIL is unsafe with your baby for some reason, I agree with your husband that you are using your child for leverage.\n\nSounds like that period of time all living in the same house harmed all these relationships.  Your apologies were a starting point to improving things, but you can't demand forgiveness on a schedule of your choosing. \n\nYou may never be close with your MIL. She doesn't have to accept invitations to 'hang out' with you. You haven't listed any behaviour here that is beyond just not getting along great, and that's common enough between MIL/DIL---and not a legit reason to prevent a good relationship between grandparent/grandchild.", "NTA \n\nSuper sketchy that she's specifically trying to get the baby when you're not around, and trying to do it behind your back.", "NTA. The odd thing here is the conniving between your husband and MIL to give her alone time with your child. Babysitting needs usually come up naturally and if your husband really wanted to facilitate this without being so obvious, he could plan a date night with you. \n\nThat being said, as a parent, I am always of the opinion that the more people who love my baby the better. If you trust that your MIL would care for your baby with love, then perhaps open yourself up to that possibility.", "NTA. Just like you cannot force her to be emotionally ready to \u201cforgive\u201d you, although I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, she and your dumb husband cannot force you to trust her with your child. \nYour child is (usually) the most important thing in your life- it\u2019s natural to be protective and selective in who you trust to care for them. Her lack of respect towards you, and her lack of emotional maturity and boundaries are likely the very reason you\u2019re not comfortable leaving your child in her care. And even if you were to leave your child with her, you\u2019d likely not enjoy that time given the current situation. \n\nTell you husband to sit down while you handle this- that MIL needs some boundaries.

You did absolutely nothing wrong - calling someone elses baby 'my baby' and wanting a full nursery to have a NEWBORN overnight without even discussing it is WAY overstepping.  You're the mom - you get to set healthy boundaries for your child, full stop.  It makes my mom senses tingle that she wants alone time with her considering her past behavior and attitude towards you, and it's acceptable that until she shows you some respect you don't allow it.  I wouldn't trust her, or put up with that either.", "Ask your husband why does she need to have the baby alone?
