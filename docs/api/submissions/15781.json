When I apologized to my mil she wasn\u2019t as forgiving. She was still a bit overbearing as well, just being overall very possessive towards her. \nUnfortunately, for the first couple of months, our baby was very attached to me since I\u2019m a sahm and am with her everyday. Every time anyone would hold her (mil included) she would kick and scream and cry; after a couple of times, my mil stopped interact with her. Now that our baby is older (she\u2019s one now) she doesn\u2019t react in that way and she\u2019s allowed my mil to hold her without getting upset. Now my mil wants more one-on-one quality time with our baby to bond. \n\nThe issue is, my relationship with my mil has gotten worse and it is clear that she still does not like me. On numerous occasions I have apologized for how I acted while I was pregnant and have tried to reach out to hang out and mend our relationship but she has declined invitations. We have a family vacation coming up and she mentioned she hadn\u2019t gone shopping for it yet.

I respect your frustration with your MIL she seems extra but does that really mean your baby shouldn\u2019t have a relationship with her?", "NTA. Listen to your internal mother's intuition - Seriously. \n\nYour mil is clearly a spiteful woman who will never let go of this grudge, ever. If she gets irrationally mad at you again, she may harm the child as revenge (in her mind) against you. It hasn't happened yet, but you're obviously fearful that she will do this as it sounds like she has the capacity and inclination to do so.\n\nOver 90% of child abusers are someone they know, and almost 80% of child kidnappings are done by a family member. Look these statistics up; they are shocking yet accurate. You feel in your gut something is amiss, otherwise you'd have let her be alone with the kid by now. \n\nThe fact that she tried to pull the old Bugs Bunny switcharoo to babysit alone while you and hubby went shopping is super shady. That, along with her manipulating your husband to try to be unsupervised with the baby, is even worse. These are blatant warning signs that you should NOT leave them alone together.

Your apologies were a starting point to improving things, but you can't demand forgiveness on a schedule of your choosing. \n\nYou may never be close with your MIL.

The odd thing here is the conniving between your husband and MIL to give her alone time with your child. Babysitting needs usually come up naturally and if your husband really wanted to facilitate this without being so obvious, he could plan a date night with you. \n\nThat being said, as a parent, I am always of the opinion that the more people who love my baby the better.

Her lack of respect towards you, and her lack of emotional maturity and boundaries are likely the very reason you\u2019re not comfortable leaving your child in her care. And even if you were to leave your child with her, you\u2019d likely not enjoy that time given the current situation. \n\nTell you husband to sit down while you handle this- that MIL needs some boundaries.

You're the mom - you get to set healthy boundaries for your child, full stop.
