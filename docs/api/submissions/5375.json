That driver is already an aggressive, unsafe driver and I doubt the driver has even given a thought to the fact that you have snow on your vehicle. It is not a \"deterrence.\" It IS, however, an added risk. The one driver that continued to follow you was likely very angry and was agitated. That is never a good thing. He could have pulled a g u n or rammed you or any number of bad things. Not all people back off or go around when they're irritated. Is it worth the risk to \"teach the driver a lesson?\"  You state one driver was blinded and went off into an embankment. Do you believe that was safe?  Do you want to share the road with a driver that is blinded, even for a moment?  Further, what if that driver ran off the road and down a ravine or into a ditch or whatever was beside the  road. There's a high potential for injury or death. Your actions could kill someone. Suppose there was a passenger in that car. Would you want the burden of knowing your passive-aggressive act caused someone's injury or death?  I wouldn't want that. \n\nWe could also get into the whole debate about whether causing a hazard it legal. I don't think we need to do that. I'm sure you get the point. \n\nYTA. Remove the snow.

Not only is it an AH live, but super dangerous as well.", "YTA.
