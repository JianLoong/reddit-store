I am quite small and eat very small potions, my boyfriend is quite tall and eats alot. We both do sports but that doesnt trigger me eating more but he does it a bit more after doing his sports. \n\nFor as long as our relationship, he always ate abt 2/3 of all food we make/ share or going out eating. Generally, I we both are students so we are limited in our spending. I was not really upset abt him eating more as me, but he also said several times i should pay 50/50 for food. I do see points against and points for this statement but there are other issues. I make food arround 70% of the time, and he doesn\u2019t want to go out eat that much since he is an introvert and doesn\u2019t want to spend much money on food. A week ago i made a big lasagna, with meat ( meat is quite expensive here and i just don\u2019t want to get the cheapest meat). I paid for all ingredients and made it for us to share. He ate abt 2/3 of the whole thing, and i ate a bit less then 1/3 and saved me a slice for the next day to take with me to university. The next day i opened the fridge and the lasagna was gone. I asked him if he ate it and he said yes. I was very upset since it was not an isolated event, and told him that he had no right to took my slice. He got angry and said, that is only natural for him to eat that much and said i should make myself something else then. After it i was incredibly mad and also suggested him to then spend a bit more money on food than I do, meaning 40/60 or smt. He got mad and shut down since then and saying I am completely crazy and should respect that he just need more food in general. \n\nAs I said it is not an isolated Event and he always eats more then 2/3 of the food. Even the expensive stuff i would get for myself is sometimes gone. I do get snacks which i know he would like, but the  would never do the same. But even if I eat less and save myself a piece it was usually gone, or snacked on. \n\n\nAITA for telling him to pay more if he eats more?\n\n\nEDIT: i told him as i put the slice into the fridge that i wanted to bring it with me to university so he knew", "created_utc": 1683285525, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138ilo1/aita_for_asking_my_bf_to_spend_more_money_on_food/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He makes his. Bet he changes his tune quickly", "NTA my ex and I were in a similar situation. He would eat 3000-3500 calories a day, I would have around 1600-1800.

As for eating food you have advised you are taking for lunch - being hungry is not an excuse to just take your food", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not even about the food it\u2019s about basic respect.  He routinely takes things you have set aside for yourself, with no care as to your feelings about it.

And if he's not doing the cleaning up after you cook 70% he should either do that and pay even more.  Cooking is alot of work.

Me and my GF share costs 50% as well, but everything is included. I definitely eat and drink more, while she uses more hygenic stuff. This is also true for new additions to the kitchen, which are most of the times, more something she wants and needs, so I can use it as well of course.\n\nNevertheless, if it is only food, I would agree to 40:60 surely, maybe even 35:65", "You\u2019ve been together for 2 years, and it\u2019s only now that you finally decide it\u2019s not ok and that he needs to pay more/buy more food? \nESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
