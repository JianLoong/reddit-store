It's a girl.I have a stable job and an incredible husband, we got married 3 years ago. This pregnancy has been a huge happiness for me and my entire family.\nNow comes the complicated part. My friend Camille and I have been friends since we were little. We went through a lot together. Happiness, sadness, complicated family moments. Literally a lifetime together.\nCamille became pregnant two years ago and unfortunately the baby died during childbirth.\nShe had been struggling with fertility issues and her pregnancy had been difficult from the\n beginning.\nI don't need to explain how terrible it was for her. She went into a deep depression and I have helped her in everything I could. She even came to live with my husband and I for a while.\nCamille had a daughter whom she named \"Ingrid\"\nA few day  ago Camille asked me if I already had names for my daughter and I answered yes but I wanted to talk to her about it. I told her of my intentions to give my daughter the middle name \"Ingrid\"\nShe burst into tears inconsolably. She started yelling at me that I was selfish, a bitch, an idiot for \"stealing\" his baby's name.\nShe yelled at me how could I do that to her knowing what that name means to her.\nI tried to explain but she wouldn't listen to me.\nMy reason is simple I want to name it after my little cousin who passed away and was like a sister to me. She passed away after a battle against cancer. I was 16 years old and she was 8. I always knew I would name my daughter after her. Camille knew about my Ingrid and was even at her last goodbye. She spend days drying my tears.\nWhen she told me about her baby name I was a little bit upset but I never said anything because I don't own the name.\nSince she left she has been posting hints on Instagram about fake friendships. She's already told her family and they haven't stopped filling my phone with messages about how insensitive I am.\nIt was never my intention to hurt Camille but so many messages made me feel terrible and I don't know what to do anymore.", "created_utc": 1695875927, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16u6iil/aita_for_stealing_the_name_of_my_friends_baby_who/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s okay to let some friendships go.", "NAH - It sounds like both of you are dealing with a loss.  I'm so sorry.", "NTA - no one owns a name, and if she was at your cousins last goodbye she should know how much this means to you, plus it\u2019s literally a middle name\u2026", "Nah if your child\u2019s middle name is worth more then this friendship then you did nothing wrong from a strangers perspective", "NTA. So much tragedy all around.\n\nYou have such valid reasons in naming your baby Ingrid plus it is the middle name, not the primary one.\n\nI would respond to the people texting you and explain, but with the loss of a baby emotions are going to run high. It sounds like your friend seriously needs some grief counseling.\n\nI hope things get better", "Oh dear. That is a massive overreaction on her part. You are not an asshole. Your friend is struggling. However, that does not give her the right to scream at you, call you names, and attempt to publicly shame you.

It shouldn\u2019t even be an issue.", "NTA\nYou didn't claim the name when she got pregnant while it was already a dear name to you.

Weird reaction, honestly. I didn't see that coming.

You have the right to give your baby a name that is meaningful to you, she doesn\u2019t get a say in the matter.\n\nI think it is worth keeping in mind that while you have nothing to feel guilty about and your have the right to give your baby whatever name you want, it is a name connected to a deep trauma that your friend experienced, so she is not exactly in the wrong to be upset about it, I think she has handled her emotions poorly and some of her behaviour seems a bit problematic but it\u2019s understandable for her to be upset.\n\nThings like this are a bit of a grey area but when it comes down to it you shouldn\u2019t allow other peoples feelings to dictate your choices, especially choices as important and meaningful as your baby\u2019s name. It\u2019s ok for her to be upset but that is her own issue to work on, not a problem for you to fix.", "NTA if you wanted to and she was telling lots of people this story, when you announce the name it might be nice for you to say that she\u2019s named after your cousin and an indirect way of handling", "NTA , she knew about your \"Ingrid\" and how you always wanted to name your baby after your cousin.

You didn't steal anything. It's a name. Unless it's a name you actually made up, no one owns a name. On top of that, you always intended on naming your child after your cousin, so it's not like you copied Camille's child's name out of the blue. It's a sentimental name for you which happens to also be Camille's baby's name. It's unfortunate but it doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA, you are not stealing anything but choosing a name that is meaningful to you. Your friend's reaction, albeit from a place of pain, is hurtful and inappropriate.", "NAH. Your friend is acting unresoanably, I agree. At the same time, she lost her kid and you lost your cousin. I think you should try and talk to her again. Explain to her that it wasn't your intention to hurt her, remind her that Ingrid was the name of your cousin who sadly passed away and you wanted for your baby to have at least the middle name. Your friend is also struggling. Maybe she didn't know what you wanted to name your future baby ?

But, from your description you also didn\u2019t talk to her about your feelings on the matter, so she may have forgotten given that it sounds like at least 10 years passed between your cousin passing and her getting pregnant, so a light YTA for not communicating.\n\nA bigger YTA for you OP because you were aware she lost her daughter at birth and has been dealing with depression for years over it. A better way of handling this would have been reminding her of your cousin, and saying that you wanted to give your daughter the middle name \u201cIngrid\u201d to honor your cousin and your friend\u2019s daughter. Since it sounds like you more or less opened the convo with \u201cI\u2019m naming my daughter Ingrid\u201d, it comes off as YTA there.\n\nTherefore, ESH.", "Yes you are.", "YTA, you can't seriously think that naming your child Ingrid after what your friend Camille has been through is okay. It's an emotional minefield for her, especially after losing her child. Doesn't matter that you wanted to honor your own cousin; timing and context matter here. Right now, you're the insensitive one.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve said something at the time. It\u2019s now associated with another person that passed tragically. This is just weird and unnecessary.", "Sorry, but gentle YTA\n\nHer baby died. The pain she has experienced is unthinkable. As her close friend, how could you even think of using her baby's name without her permission? I understand it was your cousin's name, but please put this in perspective. You lost your cousin many years ago. *Her baby died less than 2 years ago*. Her feelings here are the bigger consideration.", "Inadvertently TA. I don\u2019t think you mean to be, but Ingrid is not a common name these days and you had to know it would hurt Camille.\n\nCan you find another name that begins with an I? That is the tradition in my family to name someone with the same first letter but differ by name of someone who died that we are honoring. If you have ever watched Casablanca, Ingrid Bergman\u2019s character is named Ilsa. That is an example of a name that would have two ways of connecting to the name Ingrid. \n\nI know she doesn\u2019t own the name, but she is a close friend in pain. You have all right to give hour child the middle name of Ingrid, but you will likely lose this friend.", "Maybe the name is jinxed? 2 young loved ones gone. If you look at the name Ingrid, you can see the words girl and rid. Maybe that's an omen and it's time for a fresh start for your baby girl? Also this would be the 3rd female. My gut feeling is don't use that name and let it RIP like the 2 loved one's that passed. Technically you are both TA and both NTA.\n\n Also ya could try changing the name around or adding a modern twist to the end or something?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Names mean a lot I know I was so scared someone would name their baby after mine who was stillborn (and yes I knew it wasn\u2019t my name to have but grief!)  and it took a few years for me to get over that hold.

She's not beholden to Camille's feelings on the matter.", "This", "Both people passed away tragically. Just because one died more recently doesn't mean OP can't honor her cousin. Just like all the people who name their kids after their dead grandparents who might have died years ago.", "Op told her years ago she was calling her kid Ingrid if anything she choose an already chosen name.", "Just letting you know, no one owns a baby name. OP can honour her cousin, regardless of how long ago she died. There\u2019s no time limit on grief, so realistically OP could still be grieving (it doesn\u2019t say anywhere whether or not she still is. I\u2019m saying hypothetically). OP has every right to use the name Ingrid and doesn\u2019t need her friends \u201cpermission\u201d that\u2019s just stupid to say that one needs permission to use a name.", "It\u2019s going to be a second name. That should change the Mazal (fate) attached to it.", "But as the best friend knew what the name Ingrid meant to OP, as I'm sure she did, then it's actually her who's been a bit off calling her dead child that. \n\nTo be fair, as the name is now connected with so much death, I wouldn't want to burden my child with it, honestly.", "Look, I\u2019ll never say a parent losing a child isn\u2019t about the worst thing ever. My mom lost my sister when I was 15. To this day, it\u2019s my worst fear that I\u2019ll outlive one of my kids. But if you\u2019ve been planning to use this name for years, to honor someone special, a friend losing a child with that name doesn\u2019t all of a sudden rule it out, as a middle name by the way. Absolutely, there needs to be sensitivity to the friend, and OP demonstrated that. The friend is understandably affected by the use of the name, but it\u2019s coming from a completely subjective place. She\u2019s not acknowledging that OP liked the name first, or that the name was to honor her cousin. In the friend\u2019s mind, all that goes out the window because now that\u2019s HER name. I\u2019m not ok with that. I guess you basically decide whether to scrap the friendship or change the name. Sucks, but some people will put you in that quandary.", "Just like camille died when she used the name she knew op wanted to use.", "Her best friend's baby died.

The fights between these two are fueling that as well.", "I think the situation changed when Camille's baby died. \n\nI know I'm getting downvotes but I'm leaving it up. All I know is, if my best friend had a child who died and they asked me not to use that name for my child, I wouldn't die or kill the friendship on that hill. There are almost infinite names to choose from that don't further hurt Camille.", "It's not about a time limit on grief, it's about how seriously this would hurt Camille.", "It's a middle name, she's not going to hear people calling OP's child by the same name as her deceased baby. She'll maybe hear it during the christening and then never again for years.\n\nMy daughter didn't even realise she had middle names until she was about 6yo when I did the \"Name MiddleName MiddleName Surname! come here right now!\" routine, so nobody else had heard those middle names since her christening either.", "The name was special for op and the friend did know, if anything she started it by using a name that represented a loved one that op lost, plus it is a middle name. The friend is been selfish, she lost a kid but op lost a cousin and has every right to honor her.", "Ok, but like having Ingrid as a middle name isn\u2019t that big of a deal. Hardly anyone uses people middle names. It\u2019s also not up to Camille to decide what OP can and can\u2019t name her child. She also didn\u2019t let OP explain and instantly went off on her, so idk how OP is the asshole", "If the middle name is unimportant then why does OP think it's too important to change?", "I never said it was unimportant, just that it's not likely to be commonly heard in everyday social situations. \n\nMost people choose middle names to honour a relative or close friend as part of family history. That's what my parents did with me and my siblings, it's what my spouse and I did with choosing middle names for our children. \n\nIt's honouring family history for us. It doesn't matter to anyone else, and that's fine. But it will always matter for us.", "I understand this, we also gave legacy names in our family. But, when the deceased was my sister and our parents still alive, we discussed it first. It's one thing to use the name of someone who lived a full life, another to use the name of a deceased child whose mother is still raw with grief."]}
