It's a girl.I have a stable job and an incredible husband, we got married 3 years ago. This pregnancy has been a huge happiness for me and my entire family.\nNow comes the complicated part. My friend Camille and I have been friends since we were little. We went through a lot together. Happiness, sadness, complicated family moments. Literally a lifetime together.\nCamille became pregnant two years ago and unfortunately the baby died during childbirth.\nShe had been struggling with fertility issues and her pregnancy had been difficult from the\n beginning.\nI don't need to explain how terrible it was for her. She went into a deep depression and I have helped her in everything I could. She even came to live with my husband and I for a while.\nCamille had a daughter whom she named \"Ingrid\"\nA few day  ago Camille asked me if I already had names for my daughter and I answered yes but I wanted to talk to her about it. I told her of my intentions to give my daughter the middle name \"Ingrid\"\nShe burst into tears inconsolably. She started yelling at me that I was selfish, a bitch, an idiot for \"stealing\" his baby's name.\nShe yelled at me how could I do that to her knowing what that name means to her.\nI tried to explain but she wouldn't listen to me.\nMy reason is simple I want to name it after my little cousin who passed away and was like a sister to me. She passed away after a battle against cancer. I was 16 years old and she was 8. I always knew I would name my daughter after her. Camille knew about my Ingrid and was even at her last goodbye. She spend days drying my tears.\nWhen she told me about her baby name I was a little bit upset but I never said anything because I don't own the name.\nSince she left she has been posting hints on Instagram about fake friendships. She's already told her family and they haven't stopped filling my phone with messages about how insensitive I am.\nIt was never my intention to hurt Camille but so many messages made me feel terrible and I don't know what to do anymore.", "created_utc": 1695875927, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16u6iil/aita_for_stealing_the_name_of_my_friends_baby_who/", "score": 4718, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A better way of handling this would have been reminding her of your cousin, and saying that you wanted to give your daughter the middle name \u201cIngrid\u201d to honor your cousin and your friend\u2019s daughter.

I don\u2019t think you mean to be, but Ingrid is not a common name these days and you had to know it would hurt Camille.\n\nCan you find another name that begins with an I? That is the tradition in my family to name someone with the same first letter but differ by name of someone who died that we are honoring. If you have ever watched Casablanca, Ingrid Bergman\u2019s character is named Ilsa. That is an example of a name that would have two ways of connecting to the name Ingrid. \n\nI know she doesn\u2019t own the name, but she is a close friend in pain. You have all right to give hour child the middle name of Ingrid, but you will likely lose this friend.", "Maybe the name is jinxed? 2 young loved ones gone. If you look at the name Ingrid, you can see the words girl and rid. Maybe that's an omen and it's time for a fresh start for your baby girl? Also this would be the 3rd female. My gut feeling is don't use that name and let it RIP like the 2 loved one's that passed.

That should change the Mazal (fate) attached to it.", "But as the best friend knew what the name Ingrid meant to OP, as I'm sure she did, then it's actually her who's been a bit off calling her dead child that. \n\nTo be fair, as the name is now connected with so much death, I wouldn't want to burden my child with it, honestly.", "Look, I\u2019ll never say a parent losing a child isn\u2019t about the worst thing ever. My mom lost my sister when I was 15. To this day, it\u2019s my worst fear that I\u2019ll outlive one of my kids. But if you\u2019ve been planning to use this name for years, to honor someone special, a friend losing a child with that name doesn\u2019t all of a sudden rule it out, as a middle name by the way. Absolutely, there needs to be sensitivity to the friend, and OP demonstrated that. The friend is understandably affected by the use of the name, but it\u2019s coming from a completely subjective place. She\u2019s not acknowledging that OP liked the name first, or that the name was to honor her cousin. In the friend\u2019s mind, all that goes out the window because now that\u2019s HER name.

She'll maybe hear it during the christening and then never again for years.\n\nMy daughter didn't even realise she had middle names until she was about 6yo when I did the \"Name MiddleName MiddleName Surname! come here right now!\" routine, so nobody else had heard those middle names since her christening either.", "The name was special for op and the friend did know, if anything she started it by using a name that represented a loved one that op lost, plus it is a middle name.

Hardly anyone uses people middle names. It\u2019s also not up to Camille to decide what OP can and can\u2019t name her child. She also didn\u2019t let OP explain and instantly went off on her, so idk how OP is the asshole", "If the middle name is unimportant then why does OP think it's too important to change?", "I never said it was unimportant, just that it's not likely to be commonly heard in everyday social situations. \n\nMost people choose middle names to honour a relative or close friend as part of family history. That's what my parents did with me and my siblings, it's what my spouse and I did with choosing middle names for our children. \n\nIt's honouring family history for us. It doesn't matter to anyone else, and that's fine. But it will always matter for us.", "I understand this, we also gave legacy names in our family.

That is harsh, but I would personally NOT want that to be part of the story behind MY name.\n\nI agree with the others, that while your friend \u201ctook\u201d the name from you first, viewed in isolation, there is no problem in using it (she knew, that you would\u2019ve then later had babies with same names), however, I think that now, when the name is linked to not one, but two tragic deaths, you should let the name die (so to speak).\n\nYou\u2019ve prob ruined that friendship, and I question, whether you could have presented the issue in another way, but either way, I think you did your friend wrong, and you will be doing your daughter wrong as well, if you stick to that name.\n(Edited for spelling)", "I don\u2019t think anyone owns a name, but i think in some situations names are off the table and this is it.

While she might have known you had a cousin named Ingrid that passed away, did you tell her that you intended to use that name when she passed away? If not, I suspect it's just a last ditch excuse you are giving her for being cruel. \n\nYour friendship is probably over. She is probably a mess of emotions watching you be pregnant, but trying to hold it together because of your history and friendship. While yes, no one owns a name, do you really believe that someone who has fertility issues and lost what could have been their only child, wants to spend the remainder of their life looking and interacting with a child named the same by the person whose shoulder she cried on about it?  Every time she looks at her or calls her name, she will be thinking of her child that died. It's beyond cruel. Even if she pretends to be okay with it at first, her seeing you happy with a baby named the same as hers will eventually be too much. She will be looking at you and thinking that was supposed to be my life.", "NAH\nYou can name your baby what ever you like for whatever reason. Your friend is definitely feeling upset and probably jealous and she was unreasonably mean to you.  But as somebody who had a baby who died,  if somebody used that name for their child I probably wouldn't speak to them again, no matter their reasons.", "Why are you naming your kid after two kids that died?

You expected her to be happy to have a constant reminder of her loss?", "The loss of a child is the hardest form of grief to navigate, it takes decades to elaborate, if ever. \n\nAt this point the friendship is past the point it could be saved, so I think you can go ahead with the name, but I dont think it's that surprising that a grieving mother wouldn't like to be confronted daily with the name of her deceased daughter. This is not calling you *the* asshole. Just an observation.\n\nNow why on earth did your friend choose the name of your deceased cousin I cant understand. You, on the other hand, should have talked then. \n\nToo much to detangle here. Anyway, the friendship is not salvageable at this point.", "Unless you want to say goodbye to the friendship, find another name. Your friends grief is too raw.

Honestly a horrible name and horrible situations. Be a little more original and more sensitive to your friend. There are so, so many names out there...", "NAH No one owns the right to a name. It sounds like you never told your lifelong friend that you wanted to use that name for your child so there was nothing wrong with her choosing the name. Her hurt shouldn't be a surprise after the loss of her child but the yelling and name calling is way out of line.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I would want to be around someone and their child who shares the same name as my deceased baby knowing this was chosen so soon after their passing. It is totally not fair, but I couldn't handle the constant reminder. This of course would likely change with time and space which is all that you can do at this moment.", "\u201cI\u2019ve known two Ingrid\u2019s, and they both died.
