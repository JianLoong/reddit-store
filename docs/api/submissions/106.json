And recently our marriage was cancelled and it lead me losing my best friend. \nFor a little context, my fianc\u00e9 is a wheelchair user, this happened while we were together but obviously I stayed with him because I love him, but I obviously had some doubts about our future. For example, the worry I'd have to take care of him, the worry that he'd wouldn't be able to get a job if we fall off our feet (we both grew up rich and don't really need to work) ect. But all those thoughts were gone very quickly, though I really enjoy helping him throughout the day, I also love that he is alot more independent, and we are even more able to spend time together.\n\nNow I also have my childhood best friend who is also my cousin, who didn't grow up as fortunate as I did, and has always been jealous of me. And when i had my doubts about staying with my fianc\u00e9 after his accident, he was my biggest support system and was the only one I talked to about my worries.\nWell, when me, my family and and boyfriends family gathered for a party to celebrate our wedding coming up, my cousin took it upon himself to tell my fianc\u00e9 PARENTS about the doubts I had MONTHS ago. And they didn't take that well and told my fianc\u00e9 they weren't giving him any money for the wedding.because he is engages to a \"gold digger\" who \"doesn't care about him\". This lead to a feud with my parents who argued my side of the family makes more money. This argument lead to us not having a way to pay for our wedding and cancelling it.\n\nWeeks later, about 2 weeks ago, my fianc\u00e9 was crying and wouldn't tell me why or wouldn't let me console him until he told me that he found out what my cousin said at the party and I was pissed. When I finally managed to explain myself, he forgave me and I, pissed as fuck, drove to my cousins workplace, and yelled at him, I told him I no longer want him in my life, no matter the history we have. Now I know it might be selfish to say what I said, but I could have lost the love of my life, and though I said I had doubts I believe I made the right choice.
