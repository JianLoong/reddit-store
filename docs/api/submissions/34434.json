You may try to sidestep the entire issue by telling mom that you no longer wish to be a part of her Xmas letter because you will be sharing your new family's updates through your own communications.  \n\nBut either way, you will need to have a conversation about this letter, so you might as well be honest.  This really sucks, but you want to tackle this now before she starts sending out updates like \"OP and her family relocated after her husband was fired from his job\" or \"OP and her husband have been trying to start their family, but no success yet.  Best of luck in 2025!\"  Because she's not going to stop unless you change her course.", "No, YWNBTA. Your mom should be more considerate about you since you are her daughter. I think it's very odd that she does it about the whole family. In fact, I wonder if she only says good things about herself. I think that you should tell her how you feel regardless of her reaction. The fact of the matter is that she hurt your feelings and you should acknowledge her of that, especially since she does it every year. How will people know that they're doing wrong if they're never told. I hope it all works out for you and 2024 will be better.", "WTH is wrong with your mother? Of course you should tell her how hurt and humiliated you feel. And stop telling her ANYTHING you don't want shared - she obviously can't be trusted. Honestly, OP, I'd have a really hard time being civil to her, or even talking to her, for a good long time if I were you. Talk about a lack of judgment and discretion. It's truly remarkable. NTA.", "NTA. Esp considering the level of hurt you felt. And since this is evidently a recurring issue. People edit what she writes every year? Have any of you said anything to her about this?", "NTA. Please explain to your mother, although unfortunately I get the feeling she will not understand.\nMaybe ask that she leaves your section blank next year and allows you to add to it rather then her deciding what to share.", "NTA\n\nyou should definitely tell your mom how you are feeling about this and maybe put a plan in place where you write your own paragraph next year if this tradition has to continue\u2026\n\non the bright side you won\u2019t need to tell anyone you run into about leaving the program now, you can just talk about your wedding? :)", "NTA - Your feelings are completely valid and she shouldn't feel hurt if you explain that you did not want that information shared. I would definitely tell her, in her position I would like to know that I crossed a line.", "Nta. Might be time to start your own cards and have her leave you out of her letter.", "You will YWNBTA if you tell her how you feel about what she wrote about you. It sounds like you have a good handle on the way you want to communicate with her and how to communicate with her in a fair way. If she is hurt by your fair communication with her, then that's not on you. \n\nNobody can change their poor behavior if they don't know they're behaving poorly. Explaining it to her can only help her (as long as she's willing to take the help and not be too fragile and get up in her feelings about it all).", "NTA, she needs some boundaries. Maybe from now on she needs to stick to writing about herself only!!", "NTA definitely say something, if she doesn\u2019t already know she humiliated you then she needs to. \n\nHonestly, if she\u2019s been doing this for 21 years and the final product has never said anything negative about anyone until now I would straight up call her out because wtf was her agenda here?", "NTA at all! I will say i was having a conversation with a friend over the holiday saying we never really read those letters cause it\u2019s like instagram you only get to read what they want. So your mom is the AH, next year write your own letter with her failings of the year.", "NTA. This is terrible. I\u2019d probably not talk to my mom for a very long time because of this. It would cause irreparable damage. \n\nNot okay. Your mom knows better. She did this intentionally.", "ABSOLUTELY tell her how you feel. Be blunt. Be forthright. Tell her EXACTLY how you feel. Tell her words have meaning and she used her words like a knife to hurt you.\n\nIts time to be absolutely clear and blunt here because if you aren't then she will absolutely do this again next year.\n\nI'd also write up a really nasty paragraph about her with all of her hardships and only hardships and then end it with \"Name, also, takes great pleasure in writing nasty grams about her family and mailing them out - but at least everyone knows what a prize AH she is. Only AHs reveal people's private lives publicly. I take pride in being an AH.\"\n\nThat paragraph, send it to your dad, your sister, your Mom and your Mom's siblings... when she gets embarassed, tell her that is EXACTLY how you felt, except even worse because she literally broadcast your harships to everyone she knows. Let that sink in and marinade fo rher.\n\nLiterally, be THAT blunt because what she did is THAT bad and she needs to learn NOW. Otherwise she will do it again. NTA", "NTA. \nExplain how upset you are and exactly why. \n\nRemind her clearly of all the positives she could have mentioned.\n\nCan you get backup from your sis/dad to maybe each make a bullet list of talking points that your mum HAS to stick to?", "You need to put your mother on an information diet. In fact forget diet - famine is more appropriate.\n\nYes, tell her how hurt you are. But then tell her noting about your life. \"Fine\" is a good word. I'm fine. Work is fine. \n\nIf she knows nothing she cannot let you down again. \n\nNTA", "YWNBTA. What was her end game here? Humiliating you? Taking you down a notch? And why? Was she angry you moved away in the first place? Jealous of your career opportunities despite your setback?\n\nI just can't imagine why any mother would send out a newsletter that highlights her child's setback, but fails to mention the positive events. Most Christmas letters do the exact opposite. They're kind of like those fake uber positive social media posts but in a holiday card.", "You\u2019re getting married?! SHE HAD OTHER NEWS AND THAT\u2019S WHAT SHE PICKED?!  That\u2019s unbelievable. NTA.", "NTA. I agree with another commenter, you should most definitely put your mother on an information diet. I had to do that with my own mother years ago, and I've never regretted it.", "Your mom knows exactly what she is doing if everyone has to edit their paragraphs before she sends it out. The fact that she didn't wait for you to get back to her just shows how she doesn't like being corrected in what she tells others.\n\nNTA. Tell her point blank that from now on anything she says about you, that is not explicitly approved by you, will be heavily countered in a response, emailed to the whole family, that will include little tidbits of her faux pas throughout the years. If she can't take it, she shouldn't dish it.", "NTA-can I just say I hate getting those letters. The ones I get started out as a brief postcard and now is 4 pages, single spaced, back and front. It\u2019s just crazy. They put so many pictures on the cards that I can\u2019t even make out the faces. And some people are always like your mom, writing about layoffs, loss of jobs, relationship problems (but they are enduring). I joked to a friend who\u2019s been \u201couted\u201d by one of these cards to make this own card with a letter and send it out with the truth.", "Write her a letter and mail it to her. Put down how you feel and be as specific as possible. Say something like \u201cget back to me on your edits before I send this out to others\u201d at the end.", "She needs to be hurt.  What she did was an unconscionable invasion and betrayal of your privacy. She should stop writing this stupid letter. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You are NOT overreacting. Her behavior is unhinged. Like, does she have a diagnosed mental illness? \n\nI am admitting a SLIGHT bias because I personally think family Christmas letters (as opposed to just sending out cards) are more of a chore to the recipient than a warm wish. They're just so self-indulgent. \n\nBut then, that is kind of the issue. Writing this letter is deeply self-indulgent for your mother. Why was it so important to her that everyone you know hears about your recent troubles? \n\nShe either is secretly relishing your humiliation or she's the least self-aware person on the planet. Either way, you need to talk to her immediately, without mincing words. I'd be inclined to tell her that she's lost the privilege of including your news in holiday letters at all, or you'll be sending out e-greetings to all of her friends and loved ones every time she has a mammogram or colonoscopy.\n\nETA: Hang in there, friend. You will figure your shit out. You have so much ahead of you!

But this is a very bizarre dynamic that violates the privacy of your family and prevents you all of driving the narrative of your own lives.\n\nI do not think you need to explain anything to her. If she does not get how cruelly hurtful her last letter is, she is a lost cause. You simply need to state how you feel and warn her that from now on, you will share a minimal level of details about your life.

You can also let her know that you'll write your own paragraph in future, or to leave you out of her newsletter.
