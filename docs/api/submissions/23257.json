Maybe just check up on her and tell her that you can\u2019t always contribute breakfast because it gets expensive, but that you wanted to ask if she had enough food to feed herself.

It's very possible she was trying to save face when stating where the funds went. The fact is that 1k is not much when you have a family. When funds are tight, the priority is food and shelter, which leaves little for anything else. Personally, I would continue with the breakfasts and occasional lunches.

There's that saying about givers needing to set boundaries because takers never will. I'm sure you'll feel better once you verbalize this. But don't be surprised if she doesn't like it.

I have truly never understood that logic, my mom would buy food last. She argued we needed all these other things because the cable for example would get cut off if it wasn't paid but like you can't eat the tv. It doesn't make you full when you're hungry. And neither does the electricity or the other shit. What is good is any of that if you can't feed yourself? You won't last long not eating."]}
