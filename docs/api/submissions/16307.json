I walk him down a dirt road usually once a day. However, on two occasions three of the neighbors dogs have chased us down the dirt road.

I am not convinced because they were nipping at me. \n  \nI told him I didn't want to call the sheriff this time because I knew he would get a ticket for a second offense (there is a leash ordinance in our township).

Also, I do feel bad for the Dad when he's just trying to help his kid and I know it really isn't the Dogs fault. On the other hand if they are acting like this with me they could do it to someone else. If a small child or elderly person got nipped or hurt they would be in a lot more trouble than a ticket and me bothering them. Am I overreacting because I'm not hurt?

So, in that regard he isn't following the leash ordinance that protects you, his dogs and everyone else who wanders past. His problem really is easy to resolve - manage the dogs better.", "NTA. \nThere are leash laws in place for a reason. Him insisting the dogs wouldn't hurt you when they're already chasing and nipping is a huge red flag. Please do report them, you might be helping a child or someone's livestock at this point. If nothing else you deserve safety, and those dogs do too! It's dangerous for them and everyone around them to be running free like this", "NTA. He's lucky his dogs came after you, a full grown adult, who is able to read dog body language and de-escalate to the best of your ability. What if next time they go after a child who doesn't know how to react?? They could accidentally provoke the dogs or trigger their prey instinct! And then the dogs might have to be put down. It is not your responsibility to be pushed out of a public space because someone else has decided the whole world is now their yard and they can let their dogs do whatever they want. Keep reporting them.  They'll either get the message, or the dogs will be removed and given to someone who WON'T put them in a dangerous situation.", "NTA  Since the dad is the homeowner, he is responsible. Call the police/animal control as needed. Once they arrive, the issue is completely between they, and your neighbor.", "NTA. Soooo many people think their dogs would never hurt anyone and let them run around, and then the dogs attack someone and they're shocked. Any random thing could set a dog off and have it attack. Sometimes the dog's in the right in those situations, and many, if not most dogs, will not do this. But he's breaking the law, and YOU have the right to lawful enjoyment of public property. What does it cost him to make sure his dogs don't have the chance to attack anyone? He needs to step up and build a fence, get leashes, or keep them as inside dogs if he can't afford or have time for that.", "NTA\n\nYou could walk somewhere else, but there\u2019s a reason for leash laws. Those dogs should not be out without supervision and leashes.

Someone else could get hurt, even if it isnt you and yours. \n\nWhen my dogs stopped listening to me and leaving my yard during potty breaks, I put up the cheapest functional fence I could. T posts and garden wire. The fence is 5 ft tall. It is what it is, and I'm glad I did it. They're my responsibility just like these dogs are their responsibility.", "NTA\n\nThis is a pet peeve of mine, actually. The laws in most jurisdictions are very specific: the dog must be on a leash if it is outside the house. And if it is in a yard, the yard must be fenced in so as not to permit the dog to escape the yard.\n\nThere is no such addendum that says, \"Unless you're sure you have a nice dog that wouldn't hurt anybody.\"\n\nThe dog has to be restrained, period.\n\nAnd, like your neighbor's son, too many pet owners are overly assured in their dogs' perfect disposition. \"My pwecious pupsy-wupsy would never hurt anyone.\"\n\nNext thing you know, the sheriff is on the way to have the dog destroyed because it's bitten someone's kid.\n\nAlso, even if the dog is gentle towards humans, other dogs (as you're also discovering) are another matter. It might not be aggressive towards humans, but it could also see another dog as an invader of their territory.\n\nSo, you did the right thing. Your neighbor's son needs to properly restrain his dog, or he is going to be cited. And if his dog harms your dog, then something worse might happen to it.", "NTA He's lucky the dogs haven't bitten anyone. Even if he isn't the owner, your neighbour is the person currently responsible for them, since they live on his property, therefore it is his job to make sure the dogs are secure and not running free.\n\nIf your neighbour isn't making an effort to control the dogs, then the sensible thing to do would be to report it, if not for yourself then for other people's safety, and for the dogs safety too.", "NTA times 100.  This Dad/Son are completely irresponsible dog owners that needs to be called out.", "NTA it\u2019s not hard to keep a dog leashed while outside. You are looking out for everyone: protecting yourself and your dog, and hopefully preventing the consequences of a bite incident that will affect the neighbor as well as their dogs.", "NTA - You are assessing the situation correctly; it is about the safety for everyone. You should be able to walk where you wish. I respect you chatted with the father and you empathize he's supporting his son. Good job standing up for yourself.", "NTA. Every dog owner whose dogs harm someone claim that their dogs would never do that, right until it happens. If they\u2019ve chased you and nipped at you, it isn\u2019t a leap to suggest that in the right circumstances they could do more to you or someone else.\n\nI also live in a fairly rural area and frequently see neighbors unleashed dogs around. But I\u2019ve never had one chase after me or try to bite me in any way. If one did, I would immediately find the owner and tell them what happened and ask them to leash the dog. \n\nAnd that is both for the safety of people, and the dogs.", "NTA. \n\nI would report AND walk elsewhere, for my own safety. \n\nYou would feel horrible if someone was attacked and hurt, even though it wouldn't be your fault, so I'd report it. But I wouldn't walk by there again.", "NTA. Leash laws are there for a reason. You\u2019re not an ass for wanting to walk your dog safely. Mastiffs are ginormous too, he could do serious damage to you or your puppy.", "NTA.  I love doggos, but an unleashed mastiff of questionable temperament freely roaming the neighborhood isn't just a problem for you - it's a potential threat for anyone, including kids, that also reside in that neighborhood.  you're not just standing up for yourself here.", "As a person who is afraid of dogs and who therefore brings out the aggression in them, please report him.

Not only could any of those dogs harm you, they could hurt your dog. Or they could get run over. It\u2019s irresponsible dog ownership to allow them to run free out into the road. Call the sheriff as many times as necessary to get them to keep the dogs in their yard.\n\nBtw, I do not agree with staking a dog unless necessary, and then they must have access to shade, plenty of water, and food.

That is my main message so take the next one with a grain of salt. \n\nBut if you carry some beggin strips or similar and talk to the mastiff one in a cutesy voice a bit and give him the goodies when you pass by (and the littles too, maybe only if they aren\u2019t nipping though) and he is calmish I bet he\u2019d be a friend before too long. \n\nI have found Danes and Mastiffs to be kinda shite guard dogs because everyone I\u2019ve known has been super easy to bribe with sweet words and treats. I\u2019ve been making friends with them since I was a toddler feeding the neighbor\u2019s mastiff mutt my animal crackers through a chain link fence.", "NTA.  You cannot be the only person who walks down that road and encounters this problem.  The ordinance is there for a reason.  Your neighbor is just trying to help out his son\u2026I get it.  But dogs behave differently around the people they are accustomed to than they do around others.  So the neighbor\u2019s insistence that the dogs won\u2019t hurt you (or anyone) could be misguided.  Plus it doesn\u2019t sound like he and his son are actually making any attempt to keep the dogs in their yard.  A simple corkscrew stake you twist in the ground with a coated cable lead attached to it would probably contain either the little dogs.  And a heavy duty cable tie-out wrapped around a sturdy tree would probably keep the Mastiff in the yard too.  (though dogs that size can be difficult to contain.)  These are inexpensive solutions to a common problem.  It\u2019s not like the concept is new.  Now, of course, some dogs are little Houdinis and can get pull themselves free of just about anything\u2026but they\u2019d be trailing a lead if they did\u2026which would make it obvious that their owners were at least TRYING.  That doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here though.  I mean If the neighbor isn\u2019t not willing to spring for a couple of dog stakes and a cable for the big dog, then perhaps the expense of a ticket might convince him it\u2019s worth the investment.  Just saying.", "NTA. This is not a safe situation. Call animal control.", "Funny you say that one of the smaller dogs has three legs. The other is a Yorkie. Thats why I felt a little silly saying \"those dogs tried to bite me\". The little ones are the ones that tried to bite me and the bigger one sort of just growls and barks but gets really close.", "For sure. I definitely felt like I was able to handle it pretty well. I stayed calm and kept my dog under control where had I gotten really anxious or let my dog escalate it could've been worse. I think that's why he might not be taking it seriously because, I managed to not get hurt.", "Yes. Honestly, the dogs are just acting like dogs. They think they are protecting their home. Thats why I talked to him instead of calling the sheriff again. I really don't want something to happen to the dogs. I just also need to be able to walk my dog without fear.", "Right the only reason I do feel bad is that we live in a semi rural area. So it is not uncommon to have unleashed dogs in your yard. However, it's the coming out of the yard and into the road I have issues with.", "Yes that's honestly my thinking. I'm trying to be a good neighbor and tell you about a problem before it's a huge problem. I just felt like maybe since I wasn't really hurt just scared I was being dramatic.", "I felt like maybe picking this hill to die on was being dramatic.", "We are semi-rural so the ordinance states \"Dogs need to be contained and under control on your property\". Basically you can have a farm dog that runs around your property unleashed as long as they are under your control. The Sheriff did tell me that does mean if they leave their property unleashed that is against the ordinance.", "I am of the belief that ALL dogs bite, given the right circumstance.

Because, then at least they'd be trying. But, the dogs aren't even wearing collars they obviously aren't being contained at all.", "Trust your instincts on this one.

If nothing else, they can use stakes with long leads to keep the dogs on the property, and that's not an expensive thing to do.", "It's not. A mastiff-mix could seriously hurt a child. Not that it would, but it could. \n\nHowever, even the smaller dogs could hurt someone.  The only dog to ever bite me (and draw blood) was a chihuahua.", "I agree with you. You just never know what will set a dog off.\n\nWhen I was little, we had a collie shepherd mix that everyone loved. The kids in the neighborhood would play with him. But then, for some reason one day, this man happened to be walking by, and our sweet dog actually bit him. I wasn't there at the time, but I could scarcely believe it.\n\nI have no idea why. I don't know what set our dog off. What association did our dog make that made him regard this man as a threat? Particular smell, particular odor? Tone of voice? Did he look like someone our dog didn't like? We'll never know.\n\nThe man was actually quite nice about it, considering our large collie-shepherd just attacked him. But we learned our lesson.

Doubtful the neighbors will keep these dogs under control and it only takes one time for them to seriously hurt/kill  you or your dog.

I'm hoping he was just trying to reassure you that the dogs are friendly, while also taking into account that he needs to be responsible for keeping them in his yard.

Or if he was polite/receptive? Perhaps he had thought he had secured the problem after the sheriff came out, and the dogs have found a new way out?  If you felt like he was polite and had made an effort, and it happens a third time, I would ask him just one more time directly.
