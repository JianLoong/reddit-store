But, over the past 10 years or so has turned into a verbal abusive monster. He blows up over the slightest inconvenience, refuses to help with kids (barely does the minimum), and is even verbally abusive to my mother, who is in her 70's; she helps with their kids during the week and on vacations. He's some terrible things to event the children as well. Called my sister and their first born fat and lazy, when he barely ever helps with household chores. He's left their whole family at an amusement park and drove home alone, which is about 1.5 hours away, and stranded them there. Luckily, it was an extended family meet up and was able to get a ride home. A lot of time, he's projecting his insecurities, and lately it's been blatantly obvious. I try not to get into their arguments and let a lot slide, I just don't talk to him much when we get together as a family. But, I've hit my over line point recently. They took a trip with my mother and he misplaced his wallet into one of my sister's bags. He went into a narcist rage and unleashed on my sister and my mother. He's said some hurtful things before, even said to my mother, \"why don't you die already.\" Which, I don't how I let that slide. This time he said a lot to my mother as she was  defending my sister from his verbal assaults. A few things he said, \"you're the reason your husband (my father) died early.\" He passed away years ago to a heart attack. For some reason, he brought me into this assault as well, which I won't get into. That was the last straw for me, attacking my mother and father, let alone being a terrible person to his family as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter this happened, my mother told me all about the verbal fight. She was so mad at him, she grabbed him and wanted to strike him. I was so angry that I wanted to go over to his house and lay into him. I realized that would solve nothing. So, I decided to not be involved with anything that he is present. I just can't let this slide, and if I see him again, I'm going to confront him about everything he said and did. My youngest nephew's (their son), birthday is coming up and I said I would not attend if he is there. I don't want to cause a scene or argument and ruin his 4th birthday. My sister was upset that I didn't want to attend and even told me to just ignore him and show up for the kids. I just can't let any of  this go and I even so angry talking about it. He never faces any  consequences for his actions, and I tried to let my sister know she is a verbal abuse victim, but she wants to stay with him for house and kids, which I think is just  selfish.

You can\u2019t just ignore someone who is saying shit like that. Just stay home.", "NTA\n\nanyone still attending is the AH", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry this would be so tough. Of course you have to distance yourself as it\u2019s the only sane thing to do. I would tell my mom and my sister exactly why I\u2019m distancing myself, let your sister know that as soon as she wants to get out (for her safety and the safety of the kids) you will help her. \n\nI\u2019d keep an eye out for reportable things and contact cps, this AH is abusive and your sister are unfortunately letting him around the kids. \n\nOne note though - can you still reach out to your nephew? Maybe take him for birthday icecream? I grew up with an abusive father and I am still hurt by knowing that many people saw it and didn\u2019t do anything, they also distanced themselves from him and therefore the family, leaving me there with him. Hopefully your nephew can look back and know you did your best while still taking care of yourself.", "NTA- I feel like when anything starts with someone else being emotionally abusive it's kind of obvious you're not the asshole", "your sister is allowing this \"man\" to abuse her family, herself, and her children. she is therefore complicit. \n\nyou are NTA.", "first of all.. NTA- you are free to associate or not with whom you choose.\n\nSecondly, you are not wrong, in general, to create and enforce personal boundaries. But be careful not to insist that others follow your lead. You do what you have to do, but understand that others do as well. Your sister is sufficiently in denial as to her situation that it's probably going to have to get worse to get better. Set the boundaries you need to to protect yourself, but let her know that you'll be there for her when it finally clicks for her.", "NTA\n\nHe gets away with it because everyone let's him. Your sister let's him. He's abusing her, and it's almost impossible to stand up for yourself in those situations. She has normalised and rationalised his behaviour in her head so much that she doesn't even realise what he's doing is wrong anymore.\n\nShe needs people to show her that it's wrong. Refusing to be around him is one such consequence. If you are around him and he starts to be verbally abusive again, call the police. Immediately. Describe loudly what he is doing. It's amazing how quickly that can knock some sense into people. Your sister might double down, or she might be relieved.\n\nEither way, make a stand. Tell your mother that you think she should also refuse to ever be around this heinous man again. If they want childcare, your sister brings the children to her, never her husband, and any insults to her mean the children must leave.\n\nI also recommend that you contact CPS about his behaviour. Children raised in abusive homes suffer enormously. If your sister can't protect them, you should.", "You\u2019re not the asshole, but you are those kids uncle/aunt and you should do your best to be around for their birthdays and other events important to them, it\u2019s likely they don\u2019t have the greatest home life.", "YTA for not standing up for your Mum sooner. I had an abusive sister-in-law for over 20 years. I ignored her comments and behaviour until she made the mistake of insulting my parents in front of me, and then I yelled and refused to apologise even when she tried crying. I\u2019m not unsympathetic to your problem, but I find it odd that your final straw was the abuse being directed at you and not your sister and elderly mother", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had to draw a line.", "She doesn't want to leave her house. He makes really good money and they have a rather large house. I told her, \"your kids are your home, not your house.\" I also told her to open a new checking account start putting money into it and contact a lawyer. But, I doubt she's doing any of that. All I can do is try to make her realize she's a victim of abuse and my mother and I will help her with whatever she needs.", "I agree. I don't think he'll ever become physical, but I can't say that with 100% certainty. I'll have to work with my mom. I guess he eventually apologizes to my sister, but I'm not sure she's just covering for him. She knows she can take him for everything, and I hope she does.", "That's exactly what I said. I would make it up to him for not being there. He has never been physical, but I can't say it would never escalate to that with 100% certainty.", "Thank you. I'm letting her know I support her and her kids fully and will help them with whatever they may need should she decide to leave him. I was hoping this will be her realization that he's creating a riff throughout her and our families.", "That wasn\u2019t the final straw it being directed at me. It was for everything he said to my mother this last argument, including my deceased father. She just told me he mentioned me as well to try to make my mother feel worse. My mother then told me everything. Most of these interactions were second hand I didn\u2019t find out till recently. He doesn\u2019t act this when I I\u2019ve been around them. I only knew of him ditching the family at the amusement park, and petty squabbles. I figured he was an asshole, but I didn\u2019t know it was this degree. If you re-read that sentence, I clearly state attacking my mother and father. Please be a little more attentive.", "Then she is just as much of an AH as he is for valuing money over the welfare of her children. There is no helping someone this shallow and uncaring. Please try to be a safe spot for the children, but as far as I'm concerned, she deserves whatever he does to her because she is willing to let him destroy her children so that she can live in a nice house.", "I do think if I was in your position I would have a very frank conversation with my sister (I\u2019m sure you probably already have). I would tell her you are allowing your kids to be verbally and emotionally abused for a house and money. She may not be the one hurling insults but she is the one keeping them in that situation.", "your next level challenge is to not let her feel your judgement. let it be known you disagree, but if she feels judged, she might resist coming to you."]}
