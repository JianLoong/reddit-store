He's some terrible things to event the children as well. Called my sister and their first born fat and lazy, when he barely ever helps with household chores. He's left their whole family at an amusement park and drove home alone, which is about 1.5 hours away, and stranded them there. Luckily, it was an extended family meet up and was able to get a ride home. A lot of time, he's projecting his insecurities, and lately it's been blatantly obvious. I try not to get into their arguments and let a lot slide, I just don't talk to him much when we get together as a family. But, I've hit my over line point recently. They took a trip with my mother and he misplaced his wallet into one of my sister's bags. He went into a narcist rage and unleashed on my sister and my mother. He's said some hurtful things before, even said to my mother, \"why don't you die already.\" Which, I don't how I let that slide. This time he said a lot to my mother as she was  defending my sister from his verbal assaults. A few things he said, \"you're the reason your husband (my father) died early.\" He passed away years ago to a heart attack.

My youngest nephew's (their son), birthday is coming up and I said I would not attend if he is there. I don't want to cause a scene or argument and ruin his 4th birthday. My sister was upset that I didn't want to attend and even told me to just ignore him and show up for the kids. I just can't let any of  this go and I even so angry talking about it. He never faces any  consequences for his actions, and I tried to let my sister know she is a verbal abuse victim, but she wants to stay with him for house and kids, which I think is just  selfish.

I grew up with an abusive father and I am still hurt by knowing that many people saw it and didn\u2019t do anything, they also distanced themselves from him and therefore the family, leaving me there with him.

NTA- you are free to associate or not with whom you choose.\n\nSecondly, you are not wrong, in general, to create and enforce personal boundaries.

Refusing to be around him is one such consequence. If you are around him and he starts to be verbally abusive again, call the police. Immediately. Describe loudly what he is doing. It's amazing how quickly that can knock some sense into people. Your sister might double down, or she might be relieved.\n\nEither way, make a stand. Tell your mother that you think she should also refuse to ever be around this heinous man again. If they want childcare, your sister brings the children to her, never her husband, and any insults to her mean the children must leave.\n\nI also recommend that you contact CPS about his behaviour.

I told her, \"your kids are your home, not your house.\" I also told her to open a new checking account start putting money into it and contact a lawyer. But, I doubt she's doing any of that. All I can do is try to make her realize she's a victim of abuse and my mother and I will help her with whatever she needs.", "I agree. I don't think he'll ever become physical, but I can't say that with 100% certainty. I'll have to work with my mom. I guess he eventually apologizes to my sister, but I'm not sure she's just covering for him. She knows she can take him for everything, and I hope she does.", "That's exactly what I said.

I'm letting her know I support her and her kids fully and will help them with whatever they may need should she decide to leave him. I was hoping this will be her realization that he's creating a riff throughout her and our families.", "That wasn\u2019t the final straw it being directed at me. It was for everything he said to my mother this last argument, including my deceased father. She just told me he mentioned me as well to try to make my mother feel worse. My mother then told me everything. Most of these interactions were second hand I didn\u2019t find out till recently. He doesn\u2019t act this when I I\u2019ve been around them. I only knew of him ditching the family at the amusement park, and petty squabbles. I figured he was an asshole, but I didn\u2019t know it was this degree. If you re-read that sentence, I clearly state attacking my mother and father. Please be a little more attentive.", "Then she is just as much of an AH as he is for valuing money over the welfare of her children. There is no helping someone this shallow and uncaring. Please try to be a safe spot for the children, but as far as I'm concerned, she deserves whatever he does to her because she is willing to let him destroy her children so that she can live in a nice house.", "I do think if I was in your position I would have a very frank conversation with my sister (I\u2019m sure you probably already have). I would tell her you are allowing your kids to be verbally and emotionally abused for a house and money. She may not be the one hurling insults but she is the one keeping them in that situation.", "your next level challenge is to not let her feel your judgement. let it be known you disagree, but if she feels judged, she might resist coming to you.", "NTA just because your sister puts up with that abuse, and subjects her children to it, doesn't mean you have to endure it, too. \n\nIf he had a sudden personality switch maybe he has a brain tumor? But that still wouldn't excuse him being a fucking asshole to everyone.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsounds reasonable.", "Sounds like as soon as your mom dies he is going to start financially abusing your sister as well. She needs to leave before that happens.  \n\n\nNTA, he needs to have far more severe consequences.", "NTA. I would let him know that if he disrespects my mother again, there are going to be consequences and repercussions. Your mother needs to stop looking after the kids until he shows some damn respect.", "It might be more meaningful to be around for quieter times that allow for one-on-one interaction between OP and the kids. Big events can make it hard to have meaningful conversations, and they're also prime situations for abusers to blow up.", "You, your mom, and your sister (if you can convince her) should read the book \u2018Why Does He Do That? Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men\u2019 by Lundy Bancroft. Although it can be quite heavy at times, it is an excellent book that will equip you to deal with this situation.", "Cool!

I would be furious with my sister for allowing him to talk to her like that. Hell, my husband would be furious too. She is helping them for FREE and is a person who deserves to be treated with kindness and respect. I\u2019ve would have a serious talk with your sister and your mother. This cannot go on  any longer. How long before it turns physical? The safety of your mother, sister, and sister\u2019s children are at stake here. But you can\u2019t do it alone because who knows what he would say or do to you. He clearly has no boundaries. I think a major discussion needs to happen. This is about so much more than your nephew\u2019s party.

Your sister needs to get help and find the courage to leave him and take the kids with her.\n\nYour mom can invite your sister and kids over when he's not around or go visit them herself. She needs to understand that he's a dangerous person and having you be around him puts you at risk of harm too.", "Is this just OP talking macho in a public forum? OP has enough reason to knock out bil.. go do it, he wont quit till he gets served up some 'act right' via a back handed slap in front of the people he disrespected.", "NTA.\n\nThat said, I'm wondering if he's trying to maintain a certain lifestyle for show, and despite making good money things aren't going well for him financially.  If your sister is a SAHM, he's been handling the finances and controlling her access to his income, and he's now overextended on credit with rising rates... for all you guys know he's been hoping his MIL passes quickly so whatever inheritance comes can be used to pay down his debts.  It just seems odd that he's twice referenced death/dying in arguments with his in-laws.\n\nOr maybe I'm just reading too much into his outbursts.", "NTA - \"show up for the kids\".  Your sister needs to show up for the kids.  She is subjecting her kids to this daily, does she not think that will do them harm?  Even if (and I doubt it), he doesn't turn his anger on the kids, they still have to witness it and that is super damaging to kids - and can also teach them that this is how you interact with people.\n\nI suggest you contact a domestic abuse organization and get some information about how you can best help both your sister and your sister's kids.", "How can your sister ignore the abuse? What he said to your mother is unforgivable. I just don\u2019t understand people getting married to AH\u2019s and allowing the abuse to them and their family. Does your mother still see him? I can\u2019t believe this. NTA but your sister is. To the kids especially", "I agree with you. That\u2019s why, even against my sisters wishes, that I\u2019m not going to party and told her to never bring him to any family event that at least I am it. Number 1, I\u2019m not going to be friendly or ignore him. Number 2, she needs to understand his actions are causing consequences outside of their family. She\u2019s knows I support her fully and will be there for her and her kids. I\u2019m not sure CPS will be able to do anything since verbal abuse isn\u2019t illegal.", "It\u2019s easy to victim blame. Bottom line, she\u2019s in an abusive relationship and needs to realize that for herself. It\u2019s a bit harder when it\u2019s a verbal abuse victim, compared to a physical abuse victim. She\u2019s scared all around and needs support more than anything.", "I agree with the latter, and he is ever within talking distance to me, he will get that and then some. I told my sister is not welcome to any other family event and I will not hold back if he shows up to one.", "This is exactly how I\u2019m thinking/feeling. Other that, I won\u2019t take any crap from him and I will be having a \u201ctalk\u201d\u2019with him if he\u2019s ever in my vicinity again.", "That\u2019s why I\u2019m not going to the birthday party. I don\u2019t want to start anything and I\u2019m not going to hold back. I don\u2019t want to do that at 4 year olds birthday party. If he shows up anywhere else, that\u2019s different. Also, I\u2019d prefer not to get an assault charge. I just took a government job not too long and I\u2019m still on \u201cprobation.\u201d And no, I don\u2019t give a shit about being macho. I\u2019d prefer if she left him and took all of his money with her.", "She works as well but only makes about a third of what he does, but they need both of their incomes to live their lifestyles. And mom doesn\u2019t have any money. Lol trust me. I\u2019m not a shrink, but I think a majority of his outbursts are him projecting his insecurities. His family is terrible. They\u2019re some messed up people and they all have majors issues. Our family is very close, we spend all majors holidays together, even my aunts and cousins. His family, they don\u2019t even get together for Xmas. So, a lot of that I believe is rooted in his jealousy for a family like ours. Instead of embracing ours, he lashes out in a narcissistic rage and projects his securities on the closest and most vulnerable person.  That\u2019s what I think is going on, but I\u2019m not a professional at all.", "As I said in other comments, it\u2019s easy to victim blame. I think she\u2019s finally realizing that she\u2019s a victim and he is abusive. My mother helps a couple days a week with the kids since my sister works from home. The verbal isn\u2019t directed to kids very often, so I\u2019m told. It\u2019s mainly at my sister and apparently my mother.", "Emotional abuse is a thing, and CPS can do something about it. My baby sister (20 years younger) was removed from my parents home at 15 and placed into my custody due to emotional abuse. The investigation took longer than it would be physical abuse, but it dis result in her being removed from the home. Just a thought.", "Thank you! I will recommend it.
