You\u2019re right to be worried about your son\u2019s safety. Aside from that, you can by your son a phone for any reason, it\u2019s your money! Candace can make her opinion known, but in the end she\u2019s your ex and has no say over how you spend your money.", "NTA. Gotta have contact with your kid if your ex isn't communicative.", "NTA. Your son lives with you 85% of the time. If your ex expects you to continue a punishment that she decided on, she needs to actually get your buy-in before implementing it. She's getting the results she should expect from trying to unilaterally impose stuff.\n\nSide-note, I would not be surprised if you said she's perfectly happy to ignore disciplines you've imposed (and sees nothing wrong with it even in the face of the current situation).\n\nAs for the punishment itself, I have to wonder if it's anywhere near appropriate. If he failed the class because he was deliberately not trying... maybe. But if he failed because he genuinely struggled with the class subject, he doesn't need punishment, he needs support and understanding of why he's struggling.\n\nAs for the threat of calling the cops if the new phone was taken away, I'd say it was over the top, except for one thing.This part here:\n\n>this was the push I needed to finally get him one that Candace can\u2019t take away *(taking his phone for periods of time is one of her and Aaron\u2019s favorite punishments)* (emphasis added)\n\nThis punishment is habitiual for her. It's also a form of  isolation. Which abusers often like to do to their victims. Not that I'm saying she and her husband are abusive, per say.\n\nBut if there is any risk of it going that way, it is good that you've provided him a means of communicating with you. One for which they understand that there will be repercussions if they attempt to take it from him.", "NTA. Taking the phone away takes away your main form of contact and is wrong on her part. Especially when she could have just put parental controls on it.  It\u2019s a safety issue too. I agree there should be a consequence to failing a course which maybe having to take summer school is consequence enough?

I'd threaten to call the police in that situation for theft too. She has no right to take it away. I wouldn't allow my child to not have a phone either. The only excuse to ever take it away is if they were misusing it. Other than that it is essential for your child to be able to contact you in an emergency. It's also important for kids that age to stay in contact with their friends, no phone means social isolation. \n\nThe mother is only the part time parent, you're the full time one, you get to say what goes.", "NTA. You\u2019re the one paying for the phone so you should be able to decide what to do with it.

He should have one to call for help if something happens while he\u2019s out, or if things become abusive at home.", "NTA. Your ex's wife's actions are not only overly strict, but they also put your son in harm's way. What if he was in danger and needed to reach you or the police? \n\nMy guess is that, when he's legally able to, Emil will want to live with you full-time.", "Why does Aaron have any input at all?", "NTA. Any restrictions given in private that can be undone in public should be undone in public.\n\nIn other words, whatever rules that your ex-wife's family have in their household shouldn't require policing outside of \nthe household. You shouldn't be expected to keep track of the goings on within your ex-wife's family dynamic.\n\nIf you had a good relationship with each other then you could probably collaborate more in-depth on the parenting, but it sounds like the extent to which you and your ex-wife should communicate punishments is \"He did X so we are punishing him\" and from there let each family handle matters independently of each other.", "NTA.

They are welcome to take his phone when he walks through their door and not give it back until he leaves, but they don't get to dictate how you discipline at your house, and they don't get to keep a phone that you pay for.   Heck, they're not even the ones taking him to summer school, so it's not up to them whether or not you consider that a punishment-worthy action.  For many parents, having to attend summer school instead of having time off is consequence enough.  And in our area, summer school isn't a punishment--it's only available to students who have a documented disability as well as 'brain drain' from breaks.  Summer school here is just a way to make sure those students don't have to start over when school starts back.   It's mostly utilized by children with developmental delays who need the routine of school (and parents of those children who have no other options for childcare).  \n\n\nETA:  I missed the part where you threatened her with the police.   That's a bit far.  I'd take the phone before a visit and give it back after.  I would insist they return the phone they confiscated, then you can port the data yourself.", "Sue your ex is she continues this behavior towards your son because taking a phone away is wrong a story on inside edition a guy\u2019s ex wife literally reported him to the cops for taking his daughters phone away", "NTA your the parent he is with majority of the time.

But I think you need to break bread with your ex and her fella, and the boy, and have a discussion and clarification session about expectations, communication, and mutual commitment to being his caring but not over-indulgent parents. \n\nThen decide on the phone thing!", "What precisely is the danger inherent in being phoneless?", "ESH.\n\nYou and Candace need to be on the same page about consequences.  Neither of you should be making decisions alone about major things like whether or not Emil has a phone.  All the adults are handling this wrong.\n\nI roll my eyes at the idea that it is somehow unsafe for a 15 year old to go back and forth from school without a phone.  \n\nThreatening to call the cops on your co-parent is the nuclear option.  It is way over the top.  But it is particularly funny that you threatened to call the cops on her and then immediately asked her for a favor.\n\nYa'll need counselling.", "NAH your ex wife is right for punishing your son for failing a class.

I don\u2019t blame giving your child consequences for failing school that is a huge issue.

If you feel that strongly that a 15 year old can\u2019t navigate getting to/from school without a phone give it to him for school but do not allow him to bring it to Mom\u2019s house.

There aren't pay phones on every block anymore.  Emergencies happen and that phone might be a life line for your son.  I don't know if you can set the phone so your son can only call you and 911 at times, but that might be a possible compromise.", "NTA. I feel the same way. There are too many dangerous events that happen at schools. My kid always has his phone on him in case of emergencies. And guess what? He has never misused this privilege. And he is a major gamer and a voracious watcher of you tube. You pay for it- don't let her get away with that crap.", "Nta, parents that use access to communication as a punishment are unfit. You can prob get his data ported without her, tho", "NTA. You're defending your son from a wicked mother.\n\nShe may take the phone away just to see what you'll do. If that happens, immediately call the cops.\n\nShe wants to f around? Let her find out.", "NTA\n\nHaving a phone is a safety thing. When I was a small child my parents made sure I had quarters to pay for a pay phone in case of emergency, those don\u2019t exist anymore. When I was in 6th grade I started taking the city bus to another nearby city after school my parents made sure I had a flip phone to call them because pay phones were disappearing and they considered it important I could call in an emergency and I used it. One time in winter when I was at the bus transfer station the county made the call to switch to snow routes for the busses. So my bus that was supposed to pick me up was no longer coming. I was sitting outside, and there was a highway with no sidewalks between me and anything else. I was able to call my parents and they called a relative to come get me. Without that cell phone I would have been stuck as a 12 year old asking for a stranger to make a call for me either to my parents or the cops, or walking down an unsafe road to find a business I could go into to ask to use the phone.\n\nPhones are safety measures. If you really must buy a cheap old flip phone secondhand and buy some prepaid minutes. That\u2019ll take away any playtime aspect to the phone while still giving your son a way of summoning help in an emergency.", "YTA. People were traveling just fine without phones for many years.
