At first I figured this was because he's the social butterfly of the family. He makes people feel welcome and is really funny.\nThen I started noticing small things:\n- She'd avoid talking to other family members and just talk to him\n- Almost rush to sit next to him at family meals\n- She'd touch his arm and back when talking to him\n- She would call him ALL THE TIME and sound annoyed when he'd include me in the conversation (often ending it)\n\nThe last Christmas we had while together, I noticed J walked past everyone and straight to him. She sat down and put her hand on his forearm to have a conversation and I swear it was the \"come fuck me\" eyes (by then I was biased and annoyed though). \nThroughout this entire time she:\n- Treated my mother-in-law like complete shit\n- Laughed when her oldest bit my youngest\n- Got mad because we told her oldest \"No\" since they don't practice that\n- Tried to convince my then husband it would be better for him to live out of town and stay with them and just visit the kids back here because his work was closer to them...\n\nFast forward..\n\nWhen my ex-husband and I split, all members of his family supported both of us. I barely lost any family from his side, in fact they told him they were keeping me. Except for this sister-in-law.

So it's less weird that I'm so involved than some of you commented.\n\n- If you think I'm jealous that's totally okay, I'm not offended. I'm not sure how that works when I've never been worried about my ex or the (little bit of) attention he gave her, just that it was inappropriate she was using him as a confidante and was so anti-me. \n\n- This is just a brief outline that leaves out many more events/instances because they would require too much explanation. \n\n- Yes, people outside the family who have witnessed events/situations have made comments.", "Nta, she\u2019s wants more than one piece of that family apparently. But poor BIL and poor you. You are just trying to protect your piece. Keep being polite and doing what you are doing. I get the feeling the one day you finally snap she will enact \u201cvictim mode\u201d until no end. Good luck and you aren\u2019t crazy", "I said I'd elaborate in the original post, there's just so much though..\n\nI used to bring things up with my ex (both before we split and after) and he said she just needed someone so he was being there for her- he cared about his brother so he wanted to support his family in whatever way he could. I accepted this because he tries not to see the bad in people, and he has a hard time being the bad guy. Events and little things I haven't even mentioned in my original post led me to question things and he would get angry. He'd tell me I was the one making it weird (before we split) or being cold or only seeing the worst in her or being jealous (after we split). Now he finds her weird, doesn't talk to her much (infact he avoided asking her about something to do with her professional field until he exhausted every other option), and began to see the things I pointed out (especially after she tried to make her husband seem abusive- I know family isn't always the first to see it but that man could NEVER and it broke my heart that someone like her would ever spin things like that on him.. we actually started to believe she was abusive at one point).\n\nJ made a thing out of me not hugging her hello once (and I don't even know when it was I just heard about it afterwards) so my mother in law brought it up with me twice. The second time told me she didn't know what was going on between us but that I should let it go and be nice. I told her there was tension between us and I wasn't about to air it but I didn't think not hugging someone should be an issue. I didn't give anyone a hug... I am one of those people who doesn't kind receiving hugs and hugging back but I don't initiate hugs. And really as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to be in charge of who touches my body. So my mother in law thought I was petty and rude (even though part of the reason I distanced myself from J is because of awful she treated my mother in law). While I was still super angry about my sister in law, I made comments when my mother in law or father in law (who has never liked J) brought up some of the things she said or did to them.. my father in law would look at my mother in law with that \"SEE.\" look and she began seeing more.\n\nMy sister in law that tried to get close with her (who I've become super close with) brushed off a lot of the little bits I had mentioned to her (I kept a lot to myself because of the way my ex had originally reached, I thought I was crazy). I told her about the stay they had with my ex and she began to raise eyebrows, especially when I asked her if she'd heard from her brother because I was concerned about him after his blow up and what J said about him. She hadn't heard about it at all which she didn't like.\n\nThere's more but this is already too much. I will say, all of the family who got angry with me or brushed me off were trying to remain connected to my brother in law somehow so I can't fault them at all for clinging to whatever they could.", "NTA. It\u2019s funny how people react- ignoring the little inconsistencies that you noticed. You don\u2019t need to let people you don\u2019t trust have access to your life on or off so me.", "It is possible she is just a *pick me* type and hung on your ex because, being the more outgoing, she was more likely to get a family ally from him. She does seem to be manipulative though. It\u2019s fine to just block her. If she makes a fuss or asks why, you can honestly tell her you don\u2019t appreciate the times she attempted to interfere in your marriage, like trying to get him to move.   NTA", "NTA But...sometimes it's better to keep your enemies closer...if you get my drift.", "YTA - honestly, its a social media follow. This and all of the follow up comments were just, a lot. Really, too much. \n\nMaybe she\u2019s fake and this is all bs to get back in your good graces or whatever\u2026 or maybe your perception of the whole thing is wrong.
