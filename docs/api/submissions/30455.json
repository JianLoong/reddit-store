James had lost his wife two years prior to them meeting. James has two kids from that first marriage. A 10 year old boy and a 9 year old girl. My sister became pregnant a few months into their relationship and he proposed. They were already living together. James' kids were already expressing that they didn't want their dad to marry someone else and they didn't want a new family. They acted out a lot and it was worse when my sister was doing anything with them. Even if she just had one kid with her. They begged their dad to leave her.\n\nWhen my sister was newly pregnant James' son told someone at the store that she had taken him and he wanted his dad. Store security got involved and the cops were called. James punished his son severely and told his daughter she should learn from her brother and better not treat my sister that way.\n\nMy sister tried to get the kids involved in preparing for the baby and they were all noped out with that. They gave no input, they walked away any time the baby was mentioned, and they tore up their copies of the 4D scan my sister went for. My nephew was born a month early and my sister mentioned that the kids had tried to stop James going to the hospital to see the baby some days.\n\nDespite all this James and my sister told the kids they were going to \"say some words\" during the wedding. James told them it was important for them to publicly support the marriage and my sister told them she was going to say some words to them and wanted them to get the chance to talk about their new mom (meaning her). The kids didn't want to. My sister said before the wedding that the kids had resisted the idea.\n\nThe wedding day arrives and the kids told everyone in attendance that they hate my sister, that she isn't their mom and she'll never be as good as her. They said they wish they could trade my sister for their mom back and they will \"always not want her to be there\". I think they had more to say but James' parents stepped in and took them away. The whole thing was over pretty fast. But everyone heard them say those things. My sister was crying the rest of the day.\n\nOur family rallied around her but I did not. I had asked her way before the wedding if it was a good idea to go ahead when the kids were against it. I also expressed that the \"saying a few words\" was a bad idea when they didn't want to. \n\nIt was noted by my sister and our family that I did not support her afterward. My sister asked me why I hadn't been there to comfort her. I told her I had said my piece before the wedding and I felt like everyone should have seen it coming and I didn't feel bad for her, but I did feel bad for the kids.\n\nMy sister called me a bitch and told me I should support her because she's my sister. Our parents also told me I should rally around my sister no matter what I think of things overall because she was hurting.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699295731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17p9kd4/aita_for_not_rallying_around_my_sister_after_her/", "score": 2563, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I did say my piece before the wedding. I was open that I thought she was making many mistakes. But she's still my sister and she was still upset about what they said about her. I did not comfort her or say anything supportive. I am her sister. That's why I feel like I could be wrong for my actions.

I'm not entirely sure what they thought was going to happen.  What they needed to do was listen to those poor children and pump the brakes on their relationship, not try and force a happy face song and dance from kids who were clearly not feeling it.", "NTA. Holy shit. They're kids and it really seems like they would benefit from family therapy. I would've said NAH if your sister and her husband actually chose to acknowledge the problem and not force them to put on a happy face for the sake of their public image. Like you said, she had it coming. \n\nI feel bad for those kids bc this does nothing to help them and your sister is definitely in the wrong for calling herself their new mom. In their minds, it's like she's trying to replace her mom. That's just wrong. They'll always have a special bond with their mom. Not saying that she won't be able to have one with them down the line but it's definitely something she'll have to work for.", "Mmmm, yea it always works out for the best when 2 grown ass adults act more immature than actual children, pushing love and expecting it in return never works, how many different ways do these kids have to say how they feel before someone listens. ETA here except the poor kids!!", "NTA\n\nYour sister and James created this situation and got exactly what they should have expected.", "The children seem to be an afterthought for both your sister and their dad. The children have made it very clear that they don't want anything to do with her or the baby. \n\nThese children should be in therapy. She shouldn't have been moving in. Two years for a child isn't that long.  Seems like the only one that was thinking of these poor children was you. \n\nWhat happens of these children were to hurt this baby? What if she puts them in charge of caring for this baby and something happens? Good grief!", "Why does she get pregnant from a man whose existing kids hate her? Sounds like she invited some chaos into her life and is reaping the consequences.", "Your sister wasn't considering these children at all.  \n\nTheir father wasn't listening to their needs.  He should have stepped back and slowed down the relationship, not had your sister living with them already, when he knew his kids weren't ready.  The kids could have done some years of therapy and been allowed to grieve.  \n\nYour sister was trying to force the kids into a public relationship that was a lie.  She was basically telling them that their feelings didn't matter, only hers.  They were right to object to such a person coming into their home, and marrying their father.  \n\n**You tried to tell her.  You tried to give her a chance to open her eyes** and see the truth was this was a bad idea, all around.  \n\n**For you to comfort her when the kids got a chance to get someone to listen to them, finally, would have been hypocritical.**   She knew you didn't support this marriage, for the children's sakes.  ***She knew you were doing what she wasn't, thinking of the children who she was hurting*** by pretending to be a storybook new family.  \n\n***What else could those kids have done?  They were going to be forced to say words they knew were lies.***  By acting out, they avoided that.\n\nYou didn't go up to her and say \"I told you so.\"  But she pushed you to tell her the truth, which she knew you would.  She might be doing this to have someone to blame, but it's not your fault that she made bad decisions, repeatedly, and these are the consequences.\n\nNTA.\n\nI don't think you should be forced to support someone that is doing wrong that hurts other people, even if those people are family.  Being related isn't an excuse to pretend that wrong is okay, or that hurting others doesn't matter.", "NTA. Your sister is in for the rudest awakening of her life. I'm sad for the two children, your nephew, and any future children James and your sister have together. Sounds like one miserable household.

Don't get involved.", "NTA\n\nHow are you supposed to \"support her\" when she knowingly married a guy whose children don't want her around?\n\nPat her on the back and tell her what horrible brats they are?", "NTA. I am surprised that no one else told the couple that giving angry children an opportunity to publicly speak their minds was a bad idea.... or that it was cruel to force the kids into that position to begin with.", "How good of a parent can James be when he isn't addressing his children's feelings? Are they in therapy or is he basically hoping they will get over it? Him not taking the initiative to solve these problems shows immaturity, at least. Is he ready to father another child and be a husband?   And why is your sister ok being in a relationship where her partner's children hate her?  It sounds like therapy would be good for all.", "NTA.   Your sister is a very slow learner.  But maybe now they've gotten through to her.", "How many people does she need to comfort her Jesus Christ.

Your sister and her husband aren't very bright, are they?", "NTA but man are they in for a ride for the next 8-9 years if they hate her this much already. Wait till the hormones kick in.\n\nYou cannot force kids to accept someone else as their mom. They either feel it or they don\u2019t. They obviously don\u2019t want her as a mom or mom figure. Your sister insisting they speak at the wedding was too much for them and they let it be known.   \n\nDid she really expect that once her and their dad were married their feelings would magically change because of a few words and a ring? I bet this opened her eyes to how they truly feel.", "NTA\n\nYour sister and her new husband should be putting the literal childrens feelings before their own.  It's not fair to put two kids up there and force them to talk on something they have been very clear about having a negative stance on.  Tell your sister to book some family therapy sessions so that hopefully those poor kids can atleast feel better in their own home.", "Oh, the kids \"said a few words\" all right.\n\nThat went exactly is any sane person would have expected. Your sister and her husband were delusional to think otherwise.\n\nNTA", "Nta but your sister is on her way to being the evil stepmother. Shame on James too", "NTA. Your sister FAFO. Forcing the children to publicly announce how they feel about your sister was beyond dumb. They must have thought the pressure would make them submit, and they would appear as a happy family. Instead, it blew up in their faces, and now they have a surprised Pikachu face.\n\nThe children have blatantly expressed themselves about how they feel. I feel bad for them as their cries are being ignored, and your sister thinks that's okay instead of seeking help,counseling, or therapy for them.", "NTA, she should have broken up with him when she found out how against a new relationship these kids were. Those kids told them how they felt and they should have listened. \n\nThe dad is the biggest asshole though, in my opinion. As a parent, it\u2019s your responsibility to care for your children, financially, physically and ,in this case especially, emotionally. Those kids told him how they felt, what they felt and he ignored them. Maybe for him it was easy to go ahead after two years but it obviously was too soon and ,at the rate they went, too quickly. It really comes off like Dad is trying to replace their mom with your sister.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you were the only one who actually listened to those poor kids. Of course they don't want their mother to be replaced, and to try to force them to accept her as mother when they don't even want her as stepmother is insane!", "NTA - the step kids shouldn\u2019t have behaved that way, but they never should have been forced to put on a show and pretend", "NTA Trying to force kids into a relationship with his new wife is bad enough (got pregnant after a few months and they were already living together?) but forcing them to speak at a wedding they didn't want to happen is next level assholery. They needed more time to get over the loss of their mother without someone else trying to step in. They're just kids for heavens sake. You tried to warn them and they didn't listen, not your fault you were right.", "Shame on your sister and her husband for trying to force this relationship on the children so soon after the passing of their mother. How did they think this was going to go? I mean honestly. And then for them to find out she is pregnant after being in the picture only a few months. And then to put them on the spot and formally ask them to give their blessing publicly at the wedding after they said they wouldn't is the final straw. Putting those kids on the spot so they can pretend they're ok with this is mental.

Did your sister come up with the ideas in the hopes of giving the kids a chance to contribute to the wedding, or was it the dad's idea?", "NTA - the kids have been very clear about their position in all of this and to think they\u2019d suddenly become different people because it\u2019s the wedding is so naive that it feels intentional.", "NTA.  And it's too bad they didn't listen to you. Your sister is a total A H for calling herself their \"new mom\" and trying to force them to have a relationship they're not ready for.", "NTA\nYour sister and her new husband are living in a fantasy world if they thought this would work out well.  There ia only going to be more issues moving forward and blaming the kids is nothing short of idiotic.", "NTA. I've rarely seen a real-world example of the shocked Pickachu meme but this is it.\n\nThe kids *hate* her. Literally wish that she did not exist. Something that they have expressed both passively and actively throughout the relationship. And it was under these circumstances that their dad and your sister decided that they 'would say some nice things at the wedding'.\n\nDon't get me wrong, that still sucks, and is behaviour that comes from a willfully malicious place, but knowing this to be the case why provide a platform for it to occur?\n\nYour sister and brother-in-law were willfully stupid and selfish and should have known better.", "NTA. Those kids need therapy. The whole damn family does. I\u2019m not sure why James felt the need to punish his kids into showing affection to your sister. I do believe the kid should have been punished for pulling that shit because that\u2019s not okay and can result in very serious consequences but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay that James punished his kid as a way to set an example about what happens when you don\u2019t love your stepmom lol \n\nYour sister has quite a future ahead of her. She and James trying to force his kids into loving her is just gonna make it worse. She needs to not try and replace their mom. She needs to acknowledge to them that she knows she isn\u2019t and can never be their mom, but that they will try to be the next best thing as much as she can. They need to be able to trust her and respect her, and they won\u2019t do that if they\u2019re being forced and pressured to love and accept her in her role. \n\nSincerely, someone\u2019s step-child.", "NTA and no fucking way would I have had a child or married a man whose kids behave like this.

Despite saying your piece, she\u2019s still your sister and it would have been nice to show her some support.", "One of the worst things I ever witnessed happened when my uncle married his new wife. It's different the OP's sister because in this case, the new wife didn't want the my teenage cousins in her new family. She was fine keeping the youngest one but she was adament that my two older cousins go live with their Mom... who is a heroin addict.\n\nSo here I was at my uncle's wedding, watching my 2 cousins holding each other in a tight hug, crying their eyes out because their Dad was choosing a woman who did not care for them, and a new family over the one he already had. I've never seen anyone so sad in my life.\n\nMy 2 older cousins both ended up addicted to heroin after moving in with their mother. After several years my one cousin finally found a way out of that hole and is doing well. My other cousin died a few weeks ago from all the damage the drugs did to her. She never recovered, had kids get taken away by CPS and several were adopted within the family, spent a long time homeless, a few stints in jail, and now she's dead and was only 38 years old.\n\nI will never forgive my uncle for abandoning his kids and choosing a love interest over their well-being, let alone shipping them off to live with a heroin addict. \n\nFuck every single person that puts their love life over their kids well-being. It doesn't matter whether the new partner wants to replace the old parent or if they don't want the kids around. If either is the case, FIND A BETTER PARTNER!

Yikes.", "ESH - you were 100% right about what would happen, but you could be right AND still comfort your sister, even if she has made a lot of mistakes here.\n\nHer husband is definitely TA here, IMO - he moved WAY too fast with your sister, dating, moving in, getting pregnant within a few months.  The kids were upset from the start, both he and your sister should have taken things slow.

They are VERY CLEAR that they don't want or need a new mom. They want to honor the memory of their mama and it sounds like she's being erased from their lives. They are being forced into accepting something that is not healthy for them. Your sister and James need to see a therapist to understand where these kids are coming from. They can salvage this (with therapy) by NOT trying to replace mom, honoring her place in their lives and being vocal that your sis is just another person in their lives that can love them.

I was, in hindsight, already traumatised from having to cope with watching my Mum have 2 years of cancer treatment and die.

So I really feel for those two kids who have gone through a trauma that no small child should have to and then have to cope with a new StepMom and baby.

They are either delusional and think that forcing the kids to do so will magically make them not hate what is happening, or they only cared about how it would look to the guests and wanted to make sure everyone believed the kids were happy with this arrangement and therefore they're not doing anything wrong. Honestly, I think you were being kind and diplomatic by what you said, because I would have been asking them \"which one of these two a-holes do you want to be?\" I'm leaning towards the latter. Deep down, they feel guilty about going ahead with the wedding when they knew how unhappy it makes the kids, but they don't want anyone else to know about that so put on your happy faces kids and pretend we're one big happy family.\n\nThese kids need therapy, your sister and her husband have made selfish decisions from the start. And when you refuse to support her after she faces the consequences of her terrible decisions and treatment of these kids, she acts like the victim.\n\nNo one is listening to those kids, no one is taking their feelings into consideration... good for them for speaking up for themselves and refusing to back down. They are not ready for this, and your sister can cry about it all she likes, this is her own fault.", "NTA. There are some ideas that are so brain damaged that any sympathy you might have for the person disintegrates like Spider-man at the end of Infinity War.

If they\u2019d had a baby, I don\u2019t know what I would have done. If we had such a hard time dealing with grief and all this change at 15, 16, and 18, I can\u2019t imagine how we would have handled it at elementary school age.  So I sympathize with the kids.

Sister listened to the advice, didn\u2019t take it, and was shocked when it blew up in her face.\n\nthe only people here who deserve support are the kids", "I completely agree with you\u2026 are u trying to argue with me or just saying stuff, I\u2019m unclear.", "I don't actually know.", "Unfortunately . I didn't want to think this but I read some serious stuff and saw some documentaries/ reality crime shows which unfortunately make it a serious possibility", "Sometimes it\u2019s the bite on the bum that causes the lust", "walking into a disaster with eyes open. You can move away from unsupportive parents or adult relatives but without the concurrence of non adult kids, it is better to end the relationship. OP is NTA but its OP's sister and her husband to blame. Even with the support of OP and her relatives, they cannot make the children agree. SO the support is still useless.", "\"These kids have no mommy! They'll love me! And they'll love my unexpected pregnancy too!\"\n\nThese adults need to come to earth.", "And moms\u2026..", "4 years isn\u2019t way too fast to get married. Even 2 years is meh.", "You know what else is also traumatic? This whole relationship to the actual important people in the relationship, ***ALL*** the currently existing children.\n\nI sincerely doubt the sister's little son is going to have a great time with having older half siblings doing everything in their power to not associate with you in anyway and make sure everyone knows they wish he didn't exist.", "No, the alternative was to use multiple forms of birth control.", "Maybe they should have thought of that before completely disregarding his children and how they feel.", "Call me cynical, but her getting pregnant is sus. It ties James to her when the kids are resistant. These two people are screwing up the older kids and probably the younger one, too, who will likely be bullied by the older kids because they see the child as part of what screwed up their lives. \n\nAlso \u201crally around\u201d because she\u2019s family is some deep enmeshment BS. Glad you aren\u2019t falling for it. NTA.", "Both of those are better options than trying to force a happy family for the sake of the youngest. Now no one is happy.\n\nThat's not even including the fact that the kids had made their displeasure clear before the pregnancy, *when they were already living together*. Getting pregnant was itself a decision they made to continue deepening a relationship that frankly should not have gone somewhere so quickly. \n\nI'm not saying the man has to be alone forever, but how about when the kids stridently don't want a step-mom moving in, that relationship should be slowed and some serious conversations about how to proceed had. But, no, move in the girlfriend and have unwise sex.", "You know what else is FAR MORE TRAUMATIC than an abortion? Bringing a child into a situation where they will be anything less than welcomed, cherished, and loved. That's traumatic. That's selfish.", "she got pregnant mere months into the relationship. abortion time.", "Both of those options are better than destroying the home life of two young children who have already lost their mom. Their dad was clearly not concerned with the best interests of his children.", ">James had lost his wife two years prior to them meeting. \n\nIt wasn't immediate. But, boy howdy, did the sister and their dad not pay attention.", "Agreed this was the father\u2019s fault anyway. He knew his kids didn\u2019t like and were uncomfortable with OP\u2019s sister. Why would he send his kid with her? All  Dad and Sis could think about was their own needs. I don\u2019t feel bad for them at all. NTA", "You're out of your tree then. You can't just tell kids it's okay to make false criminal accusations, regardless of the circumstances. what the kid did is so far outside of what is acceptable, even in the context of this situation.", "If the response at every single stage of their relationship from day dot has been overwhelmingly negative it is more on the parents than the kids. What on earth gave them any reason to expect a good outcome.", "It\u2019s not like they\u2019re having good behaviour modeled for them. Nobody around them is acknowledging or accommodating their feelings.", "They clearly don\u2019t fear him if they\u2019re willing to risk punishment in order to disrupt his wedding. And they\u2019ll fear him less and less as they get older and angrier.\n\nHe has really gotten himself into some shit here. And your sister has followed him right into the deep end.", "Oh those poor kids.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t bode super well for your sister either, being in a relationship with someone who\u2019s like that.", "He will likely regret it in about 20 years when both kids are getting married and he doesn't get an invitation", "When you are a kid who lost his mum, yes, it is!", "Yeah, this marriage is definitely not going to last. The best decision OP's sister could make right now is to get a really good divorce and custody lawyer, so that she can try to make sure the baby is protected from emotional abuse, or worse, during dad's parenting time.", "The mother died *2 years* prior to them meeting.", ">That is not an outlandish timeline\n\nIn your opinion. It's outrageous in my view. Every grief journey is different and all take varying times. The father may have been ready to move in but he took zero consideration of how his kids felt.", "It is super unclear. Some kids feel as if their parents should be single forever. My co-worker lost his wife almost 30 years ago. He waited until his child were grown with their own families before he ventured back into the dating world. His children don't talk to him because they see it as forgetting their mom and that he is replacing her. They truly expected him to be alone for the rest of life after he was widowed at 33. It is truly heartbreaking because he didn't want to be alone for the rest of his life, but it cost him his relqtionship with his kids and grandkids.\n\nThe dad is and kind of isn't in the wrong, but still an ahole for pushing this relationship forward without therapy. He is definitely the ahole for moving the sister in too quickly. It sounds like as soon as they started dating that she was a member of the family. He is also the ahole for pushing a relationship between the kids and sister.", "He moved her in and knocked her up within months of their relationship starting. That's too fast for kids.", "They got pregnant and engaged *a few months after meeting*. Sweet Jesus, those poor kids' heads must be reeling. And all the whole they're just pushed, pushed, pushed, pushed, pushed into accepting \"new mom\" when they're still raw from losing their own mom. I question if sister ever gets a relationship with them at this point. She and dad have made it abundantly clear they don't give a damn how the kids feel, only what they say.", "I worry about the new little son being around two kids that hate him. They could hurt him physically if the parents don't get these kids into therapy.", "I don't get the impression they got pregnant on purpose.", "Not everyone is comfortable with that choice. And they shouldn\u2019t have to be.", "\"My sister became pregnant a few months into their relationship and he proposed. They were already living together.\"\n\nThat's pretty much immediately, even when there aren't kids with a dead mother in the mix.", ">You're out of your tree \n\nLOL.  Okay.  \n\nI never said anything about telling them that what they did was okay.  I simply believe there are better ways to handle kids with these kinds of issues.  I mean, the approach of severe punishment obviously did not work.", "Obviously it was a stupid idea and obviously it was going to end badly - to people watching from outside (and after the fact), like us.", "Agreed. As they get older they will also harden emotionally because of this. It will happen naturally without the correct support anyway but add in grief and living in an unhappy home and it will be more explosive overall.", "Yeah and crying \"Why doesn't my daughter want me to walk her down the aisle?!?\"", "My best friend died 18 years ago. I'm still missing him. And I'm an adult. And he was not my MOTHER, the most important person for a child.", "Just because it happened a while ago doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve forgotten her.", "So because their mom died two years ago they should be okay with this woman calling herself \u201cnew mom\u201d. Okay dokay", "If I was a widow and was ready to move on, I wouldn't ask my kids if they were ready - that's not for them to decide. I'd certainly be more respectful of their boundaries than it sounds like these two goofs have been, but it's not up to the kids if the dad is ready to date or not.", "She won't.", "This was exactly on my mind! They need family therapy ASAP", "OP\u2019s comment says they weren\u2019t being safe regarding pregnancy. It\u2019s pretty clear that the sister and James completely exercised bad judgment about the kids\u2019 feelings about their relationship and while it was too late after she was already pregnant, they had made several poor choices leading up to that and seem hellbent on continuing to do so.", "I don\u2019t get the impression they got to talk their loss through with their dad so they could come to terms with the loss of their mom and become more open to the idea of ANY new stepmom\u2026.  Or new siblings\u2026. But here we are where.:  yea it didn\u2019t happen so NTA OP", "That's an additional, entirely different mistake they made.\n\nHe's definitely an asshole, and a shit dad.", "You don't? Lol", "I lean pro choice but I get uncomfortable with how quickly some people expect that everyone will choose abortion just because they can. Pro choice means choice for everyone, it doesn't mean you have to want one for yourself. \nIt's the pregnant person's business and no one else's. \n\nThat being said this couple should 100% have used better birth control until they had some serious family therapy. Babies aren't tools to fix your relationship problems.", "I think you're going to need to be the cool older relative they know they can talk to when they need someone.  And be someone for them to look up to.  I wish I could be that for my niece, but my sister and her family live on the other side of the world.  These kids are at an age, though, where your support will mean a lot to them, even if they don't know it yet.", "You mean one of two most important people for a child.", "As a widow, I would absolutely ask my kids first. They are my first priority above anyone else, including my spouse. As it is, when I married my LH, I asked my kids (amicable divorce from their dad) privately first if they were okay with it. They were the age of the kids in the OP at the time. I was super relieved when they supported the move - but I would have waited if they were against. Not just move someone into *their* home and tell them to suck it up... And I also made it perfectly clear that there stepdad was NOT a replacement for their father. That's some ick right there too (from OPs post)", "I\u2019d agree if the kids were over 18 and out of the house or if it\u2019d been more than a few years and EVERYONE has grieved, but they\u2019re currently 9 and 10. Which means their mom died when they were at very young and traumatic ages, and given how dumb OP\u2019s new BIL sounds, I doubt they\u2019ve gotten any therapy to deal with the mom\u2019s passing.", "well that's incredibly stupid, then! I thought it was an accidental pregnancy."]}
