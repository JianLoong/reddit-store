I've made contact with the fleet manager via email and he has ignored all my attempts at contacting him, so I raised it to my manager, the fleet manager has ignored him too, my manager took it to the director, and he has ignored the director too, just to say there is no phone number listed. I'm not being paid the \"trade down\" allowance you usually get if you take a car below your grade which would be an extra \u00a3200 a month paid to me. I've just been completely ignored on this basis, no communication, nothing. \n\nIn terms of Private Medical Insurance, I opted to pay a bit extra each month so my child would be covered with me, all the forms were filled out to reflect this and sent off. HR then signed me up as a single person and when I queried it they said \"oh sorry our mistake, you'll have to wait until April to get him on there now\" when it's their mistake, so he isn't covered now. Noticed on my payslip that they're still taking the money out for my child, checked my online coverage with the PMI provider and I'm covered only as a single person. \n\nI've tried to contact HR and they ignore me on this issue but they're quick enough to contact me about holidays.\n\nHR also told me I couldn't take any of my holidays this year because they need to cover the Christmas period and I got a very aggressive email citing my contract at me about this, and I explained to HR I couldn't unbook the days I'd taken off because I'm getting married. This was something the hiring manager agreed was fine in my interview. HR then told me that I should unbook my wedding day as a holiday and use a volunteering day for it instead which just felt morally wrong. \n\nI'm already interviewing for new jobs, am I being the asshole for leaving after a month because I'm getting annoyed at not having the benefits they promised? To me a car is a big benefit from work and they aren't providing it or any narrative surrounding it, and the HR department are ignoring me and it's just winding me up.

Make sure its not just on your work machine but print it off and forward things to your personal accounts.\n\nSounds like they are in breach of contract.  HR are there to protect the company not the employee but in doing that they are also protecting the company from someone doing something that could lead to an employment tribunal.  Sounds like they are not doing their job as there seem so be several people there who aren't doing what they are supposed to and it will lead to problems for the company unless its sorted. \n\nSounds like you will are far better off out of that company asap as they won't get any better if this is how they act.", "YWNBTA.

They are messing you around in multiple ways and they can't all be accidents.

I hope the big day goes well.\n\nWhile it might be understandable about the car not being a top priority to fix (because they're providing a car), you certainly shouldn't be paying for insurance support for your child that they're not providing.\n\nOn top of that, if you have any evidence of you even asking for the leave you'd need for your wedding, from the negotiation phase (such as an email or contemporaneous notes) you should find those.\n\nI would suggest booking a time with your manager and explain these issues to them and ask for advice on how to get these issues fixed.
