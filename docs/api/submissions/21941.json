OK, Kevin's wife is not a good cook - - -  but she stepped up when needed. Aurora sounds like she weaponized the food so that Kevin's wife couldn't eat what she prepared. Not cool. (But it sounds like OP stands behind her on this choice or has not corrected her.) Kevin's wife then wants Aurora to get \"thrown out\" - an AH move.\n\nWhile your wife is sick can't someone step up and adult?", "ESH - Aurora sucks because she's using the food to piss off Kevin's wife. It's one thing not to want to eat the same kind of thing over and over because someone is picky. It's quite another to ONLY cook things that someone won't eat.\n\nKevin's wife has no authority to tell anyone to kick someone else out of their home. Here's a grand plan, why doesn't Miss. Picky just make her own food for herself.\n\nAnd you suck because you are old enought to be a grandfather and  that's should old enough to be able to navigate this situation. Tell your granddaughter to quite being an AH and only cook things that she knows your DIL doesn't like. Tell your DIL and son that you are doing them a favor by letting them move in a for a bit and that they aren't able to dictate who will and won't be in your home, and to grow TF up because she has hands and cook her own food if she doesn't like what's being prepared.", "ESH. Everybody is acting very childish here, while Aurora is the only one who actually has an excuse of being a child. DIL has no say in who stays at your place. At the same time, Aurora purposefully making dishes that she knows DIL can't eat is very petty. Also, DIL might not be the greatest cook in the universe, but she was doing you all a favor, so maybe instead of all of you harping on her and telling her how much her cooking sucks you should have been trying to help her improve?", "YTA\n\nNot for not kicking out your granddaughter, but for how you treat your DIL (and talk about her in the comments, that\u2019s really what made me go with this judgment) and how you dealt with the situation in general. \n\nKevin\u2019s wife (\u201ccoincidentally\u201d the only one you didn\u2019t deign naming in your post) was helping you and thanking you for welcoming her and her husband into your home by cooking since you\u2019re \u201ctoo busy\u201d to do it. According to your own comment, you managed without her before so she was in fact doing you a favor. If you didn\u2019t like her cooking, you should\u2019ve gifted her a recipe book, for example, or taught her in your free time. Funny, you didn\u2019t mention if she also has a job.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Kevin\u2019s wife lives in your house and needs the kitchen to eat whereas Aurora and Brian have a house and could eat there if they\u2019re not happy with what is being offered in your house. They are choosing to come and eat Kevin\u2019s wife\u2019s food and thus had no ground to complain. \n\nPlus, Aurora is old enough to know that her comment was super rude and to realize exactly what she\u2019s doing by choosing dishes she knows her aunt can\u2019t eat because of sensory issues (which aren\u2019t simply being \u201cpicky\u201d). She instigated the problem and keeps escalating it. \n\nNow, a teen being bratty and petty is understandable. What\u2019s not is that the adults around, including you, aren\u2019t doing anything to put an end to it and set her straight. You\u2019re teaching her a terrible lesson.\n\nInstead of making her apologize and finding a way to compromise and help Kevin\u2019s wife cook better so everyone is happy, you are not only letting your granddaughter blatantly disrespect your DIL and exclude her from family meals entirely (since they apparently can\u2019t cook at the same time so your DIL can\u2019t eat her meal with the rest of you), but you\u2019re also having a literal child cook for an entire family every night.

I think Anne knows that you don't like DIL, maybe you often talk to her and her father about it. That is the reason why Anne behaves like an AH towards your DIl and why you enable it. \n\nMaybe you want to punish your DIl for living (in your opinion) without contributing or you want her and your son to move out. \n\nBut you are a coward and can't set proper boundaries (for example, you can ask them to start paying bills or to move out) . So you chose to enable Anne's rude behaviour. It's petty\n\nTalk to your son and his wife about contributing.

Food restrictions are one thing but if you let yourself go hungry just because you don\u2019t like the taste of something, idk they\u2019re adults they can go buy or make their own meal. I\u2019m going to rationalize this the way I would\u2019ve when I was 16: She had to eat foods she didn\u2019t like and now they do too. Is it an asshole move on her part to purposely feed her stuff she doesn\u2019t like? Yeah. But she\u2019s also 16 and 16 year olds are assholes sometimes.

Even if DIL can\u2019t cook, even if she\u2019s a picky eater, it is not OK to treat someone this way.

It's more about having respect for each other and perhaps you need to mediate that because you are the host and home owner and you need to ensure peace for your guests and family. Perhaps remind Kevin's wife how lucky she is to have a place to stay for a few months and really isn't entitled to cause you to kick out someone you see every day because of her picky eating and bad cooking.
