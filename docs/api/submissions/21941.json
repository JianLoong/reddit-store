OK, Kevin's wife is not a good cook - - -  but she stepped up when needed. Aurora sounds like she weaponized the food so that Kevin's wife couldn't eat what she prepared. Not cool. (But it sounds like OP stands behind her on this choice or has not corrected her.) Kevin's wife then wants Aurora to get \"thrown out\" - an AH move.\n\nWhile your wife is sick can't someone step up and adult?", "ESH - Aurora sucks because she's using the food to piss off Kevin's wife. It's one thing not to want to eat the same kind of thing over and over because someone is picky. It's quite another to ONLY cook things that someone won't eat.\n\nKevin's wife has no authority to tell anyone to kick someone else out of their home. Here's a grand plan, why doesn't Miss. Picky just make her own food for herself.\n\nAnd you suck because you are old enought to be a grandfather and  that's should old enough to be able to navigate this situation. Tell your granddaughter to quite being an AH and only cook things that she knows your DIL doesn't like. Tell your DIL and son that you are doing them a favor by letting them move in a for a bit and that they aren't able to dictate who will and won't be in your home, and to grow TF up because she has hands and cook her own food if she doesn't like what's being prepared.", "ESH. Everybody is acting very childish here, while Aurora is the only one who actually has an excuse of being a child. DIL has no say in who stays at your place. At the same time, Aurora purposefully making dishes that she knows DIL can't eat is very petty. Also, DIL might not be the greatest cook in the universe, but she was doing you all a favor, so maybe instead of all of you harping on her and telling her how much her cooking sucks you should have been trying to help her improve?", "YTA\n\nNot for not kicking out your granddaughter, but for how you treat your DIL (and talk about her in the comments, that\u2019s really what made me go with this judgment) and how you dealt with the situation in general. \n\nKevin\u2019s wife (\u201ccoincidentally\u201d the only one you didn\u2019t deign naming in your post) was helping you and thanking you for welcoming her and her husband into your home by cooking since you\u2019re \u201ctoo busy\u201d to do it. According to your own comment, you managed without her before so she was in fact doing you a favor. If you didn\u2019t like her cooking, you should\u2019ve gifted her a recipe book, for example, or taught her in your free time. Funny, you didn\u2019t mention if she also has a job.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Kevin\u2019s wife lives in your house and needs the kitchen to eat whereas Aurora and Brian have a house and could eat there if they\u2019re not happy with what is being offered in your house. They are choosing to come and eat Kevin\u2019s wife\u2019s food and thus had no ground to complain. \n\nPlus, Aurora is old enough to know that her comment was super rude and to realize exactly what she\u2019s doing by choosing dishes she knows her aunt can\u2019t eat because of sensory issues (which aren\u2019t simply being \u201cpicky\u201d). She instigated the problem and keeps escalating it. \n\nNow, a teen being bratty and petty is understandable. What\u2019s not is that the adults around, including you, aren\u2019t doing anything to put an end to it and set her straight. You\u2019re teaching her a terrible lesson.\n\nInstead of making her apologize and finding a way to compromise and help Kevin\u2019s wife cook better so everyone is happy, you are not only letting your granddaughter blatantly disrespect your DIL and exclude her from family meals entirely (since they apparently can\u2019t cook at the same time so your DIL can\u2019t eat her meal with the rest of you), but you\u2019re also having a literal child cook for an entire family every night. Come on.", "Dear gods, your poor wife trying to heal while all of you play grab ass. I hope she books a resort and leaves the lot of you to figure it out. Sheesh. ESH", "I read your comments and you obviously do not like DIL's (maybe and your son's) presence in your home. You are pissed that she is living with you without contributing (in your opinion her bad cooking doesn't count). I think Anne knows that you don't like DIL, maybe you often talk to her and her father about it. That is the reason why Anne behaves like an AH towards your DIl and why you enable it. \n\nMaybe you want to punish your DIl for living (in your opinion) without contributing or you want her and your son to move out. \n\nBut you are a coward and can't set proper boundaries (for example, you can ask them to start paying bills or to move out) . So you chose to enable Anne's rude behaviour. It's petty\n\nTalk to your son and his wife about contributing. If they can't afford to pay you so all of you need to think about other ways of contributing or moving out. \n\nYou should act like an adult", "YTA for enabling your granddaughter to deliberately exclude your sons wife.  Aurora is essentially bullying her and your OK with that why?\n\nYour DIL might be a terrible cook but she tried and instead of being grateful you allow her to be bullied.\n\nI don't think you should kick your granddaughter out but I do think you should tell her to be inclusive.\n\n I find it very telling that you call her your sons wife as opposed to  DIL.  It's clear you don't like her", "ESH except your dil and wife, you especially. Wtf aren\u2019t you cooking? And Aurora needs to either cook for everyone or rotate cooking. You and your sons are lazy as f. Rotate cooking among everyone.", "this a twist to the lactose intolerant dil and the granddaughter constantly cooking with milk. yta", "Esh for not kicking her out, but bc your wife is sick, Kevins wife stepped up and you're bitching about it.", "There are three other adults in the house that can do the cooking.", "YTA. ESH, too, but not as much as YTA after reading some of these comments. Your granddaughter sounds horrendous and is treating her aunt like shit. Yea your DIL shouldn\u2019t have wanted her out of the house but honestly you shouldn\u2019t let her come into your house to treat people the way she is either.

There\u2019s no law that says everyone has to eat the same food for all meals.\n\nI\u2019d step in to stop the arguments when they start, because it isn\u2019t great for Aurora to have a grown woman picking fights with her.

Not to mention we have a housekeeper every other week.\n\nI work my fucking ass off to give her a nice, easy, care free life.
