OK, Kevin's wife is not a good cook - - -  but she stepped up when needed. Aurora sounds like she weaponized the food so that Kevin's wife couldn't eat what she prepared. Not cool. (But it sounds like OP stands behind her on this choice or has not corrected her.) Kevin's wife then wants Aurora to get \"thrown out\" - an AH move.\n\nWhile your wife is sick can't someone step up and adult?", "ESH - Aurora sucks because she's using the food to piss off Kevin's wife. It's one thing not to want to eat the same kind of thing over and over because someone is picky. It's quite another to ONLY cook things that someone won't eat.\n\nKevin's wife has no authority to tell anyone to kick someone else out of their home. Here's a grand plan, why doesn't Miss. Picky just make her own food for herself.\n\nAnd you suck because you are old enought to be a grandfather and  that's should old enough to be able to navigate this situation. Tell your granddaughter to quite being an AH and only cook things that she knows your DIL doesn't like. Tell your DIL and son that you are doing them a favor by letting them move in a for a bit and that they aren't able to dictate who will and won't be in your home, and to grow TF up because she has hands and cook her own food if she doesn't like what's being prepared.", "ESH. Everybody is acting very childish here, while Aurora is the only one who actually has an excuse of being a child. DIL has no say in who stays at your place. At the same time, Aurora purposefully making dishes that she knows DIL can't eat is very petty. Also, DIL might not be the greatest cook in the universe, but she was doing you all a favor, so maybe instead of all of you harping on her and telling her how much her cooking sucks you should have been trying to help her improve?", "YTA\n\nNot for not kicking out your granddaughter, but for how you treat your DIL (and talk about her in the comments, that\u2019s really what made me go with this judgment) and how you dealt with the situation in general. \n\nKevin\u2019s wife (\u201ccoincidentally\u201d the only one you didn\u2019t deign naming in your post) was helping you and thanking you for welcoming her and her husband into your home by cooking since you\u2019re \u201ctoo busy\u201d to do it. According to your own comment, you managed without her before so she was in fact doing you a favor. If you didn\u2019t like her cooking, you should\u2019ve gifted her a recipe book, for example, or taught her in your free time. Funny, you didn\u2019t mention if she also has a job.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Kevin\u2019s wife lives in your house and needs the kitchen to eat whereas Aurora and Brian have a house and could eat there if they\u2019re not happy with what is being offered in your house. They are choosing to come and eat Kevin\u2019s wife\u2019s food and thus had no ground to complain. \n\nPlus, Aurora is old enough to know that her comment was super rude and to realize exactly what she\u2019s doing by choosing dishes she knows her aunt can\u2019t eat because of sensory issues (which aren\u2019t simply being \u201cpicky\u201d). She instigated the problem and keeps escalating it. \n\nNow, a teen being bratty and petty is understandable. What\u2019s not is that the adults around, including you, aren\u2019t doing anything to put an end to it and set her straight. You\u2019re teaching her a terrible lesson.\n\nInstead of making her apologize and finding a way to compromise and help Kevin\u2019s wife cook better so everyone is happy, you are not only letting your granddaughter blatantly disrespect your DIL and exclude her from family meals entirely (since they apparently can\u2019t cook at the same time so your DIL can\u2019t eat her meal with the rest of you), but you\u2019re also having a literal child cook for an entire family every night.

I think Anne knows that you don't like DIL, maybe you often talk to her and her father about it. That is the reason why Anne behaves like an AH towards your DIl and why you enable it. \n\nMaybe you want to punish your DIl for living (in your opinion) without contributing or you want her and your son to move out. \n\nBut you are a coward and can't set proper boundaries (for example, you can ask them to start paying bills or to move out) . So you chose to enable Anne's rude behaviour. It's petty\n\nTalk to your son and his wife about contributing.

Food restrictions are one thing but if you let yourself go hungry just because you don\u2019t like the taste of something, idk they\u2019re adults they can go buy or make their own meal.

Is it an asshole move on her part to purposely feed her stuff she doesn\u2019t like? Yeah. But she\u2019s also 16 and 16 year olds are assholes sometimes.

Even if DIL can\u2019t cook, even if she\u2019s a picky eater, it is not OK to treat someone this way. Your granddaughter\u2019s behavior is obviously an extension of how you feel about your DIL, so the solution is not to kick her out, it\u2019s to have a serious discussion about arrangements in the home with the goal of a resolution everyone can live with.\n\nAre you resentful that she and your son are living with you? Are you taking that resentment out on a family member who was doing her best to help? That\u2019s certainly how it seems", "ESH\n\nSo she's a bad cook, but she's the one who stepped in when your wife couldn't do it anymore, and you all treated her with such ingratitude. And now you're letting Aurora get away with always making food she won't eat to spite her. Neither you, nor Brian, are stepping to tell Aurora her behavior towards her aunt isn't okay, and because of that, she's lashing out and doesn't want her there.\n\nNo one is doing anything to mitigate the problem.", "Aurora is 16 and cooking dinner for the family.\nIs she immature? Yup.\nDoes she need to be talked to about respect? Yup.\n\nYou are her grandfather. Kevins wife is a guest in your home. And to be honest, if a 16 year old is expected to cook for the house, she shouldnt have to cater to picky eaters. If Kevins wife doesnt like what is being cooked, she should fix something for herself. Everyone agrees that she is a horrible cook and Aurora stepped up.\n\nYour are NTA - but it may be helpful to have a discussion with BOTH ladies about mutual respect.", "I don\u2019t think you should kick her out but she needs to cook for everybody. Don\u2019t forget to be kind.", "You sound deeply unpleasant and sexist in all of your comments. You are a massive AH just based on all of that. Grow up and be the adult here. Also, a 16 year old doesn't run the show.", "ESH.  ITA don\u2019t kick out family but good grief the sexism here. Men can cook too.  Rotate schedules, pay for cooking lessons, etc.\n\nIf it was wrong for one person to serve inedible food, wrong for the next.", "Sounds like a family of AH.", "ESH. Being a bad cook doesn't make her an AH and it sounds like she was trying to help everyone out. Your granddaughter sounds petty and you sound like you're ok with her being purposely mean to someone who's been helping you and your wife out. If you don't like her cooking and your granddaughter won't stop then do the cooking yourself.", "ESH except your wife, Kevin, and his wife. Aurora is a brat and should be dealt with. The way you excuse her is annoying. You suck for allowing this to go on in your house. Your other son sucks for letting his daughter behave like a rude child.\n\nSo what if Kevin\u2019s wife sucks in the kitchen? It\u2019s irrelevant. I don\u2019t see anyone else who eats at your table readily volunteering to take the helm. Aurora is a shit stirrer and you\u2019re enjoying it. \n\nI hope Kevin and his wife can move out soon. What a disaster you made.\n\nETA: as per OP\u2019s comments, he\u2019s a raging misogynist. Yikes and not shocking.", "ESH but I feel sorry for the DIL. As the head of the household, it's your job to sort this out since you created the situation by allowing people to move in without any real ground rules. It's nice of you to let them stay but should have made your expectations clear. If you're going to have a lot of family around this kind of thing is bound to happen. (I come from a big family.)\n\nAs a general rule, cooking for a bunch of people isn't that fun if they are picky and/or don't like your cooking. However, it sounds like DIL stepped up to try and help.\n\nAurora needs to be told to put a cork in it and help with the cooking. DIL and Aurora should learn to get along. It's a life skill, working with people you don't love. Tell them as much and suggest they try coming up with meal ideas together and preparing things - together.\n\nAnd you should all be grateful if someone agrees to cook for you at all, whether it's great or not - if you really don't like it then order frozen meals or takeout.", "NTA, this is an adult fighting with a teenager. Someone has some growing up to do, but it's not Aurora. Your son needs to have a discussion with his wife and have her dial it back while SHE is a guest in YOUR house.

If only there were any other adults in the house who could step up and cook.", "What on earth is going on in this family? Sounds to me a bunch of children\u2026sorry about this", "INFO: so what's your long term goal with the relationship between you and your son? Do you think letting a 16yr old set the tone for how his wife is treated is going to make him want to visit the family in the future? Do you think you'll get a bunch of time with their kid(s) when you treat the kid(s) mother so poorly?", "ESH except Kevin's wife. It's not a sin to be a bad cook and at least she was trying.", "ESH man.....all of you suck at being nice", "Aurora is TA.", "After reading some of OPs comments YTA. One hell of a big one. Grow up. Your granddaughter isn\u2019t the only child in this story.", "Yta... teach your gd some manners, oh wait you can't bc you don't have any yourself. You agreed to let them live there rent free but you are definitely holding it over them (especially dil). You are the ass.", "exactly what i thought. kevin's wife tried her best, more's the pity, but if aurora is going out of her way to cook things she knows aunty won't like it's also being petty.\n\nsomeone has to be the grown up and say op's wife is sick and you all need to grow the F up.", "Yeah, ESH in this textbook example of a family completely falling apart as soon as grandma isn't around to run the ship.", ">choosing dishes she knows her aunt can\u2019t eat because of sensory issues\n\nlisten, E S H but lets not just start making shit up, huh?", "Apparently, the kitchen isn\u2019t big enough to cook two meals at the same time so if Kevin\u2019s wife cooks her own meal, she can\u2019t eat at the same time as the rest of the family. \n\nAlso, she lives there while the granddaughter doesn\u2019t. She was nice enough to cook for two additional people on top of the five people who live in the house (OP says she and Kevin have a son).

Aurora just says ok I won't cook then\n\nAnd then Kevin and his son will look at her with puppy eyes and basically begging her to cook because they haven't eaten such a good food in a long time(Aurora is an amazing cook) and we have to let her cook whatever she likes", " Not just his decision though. It sounds like (from OP's comment) DIL's own family (husband and son) wants Aurora to keep cooking because they never get to eat good food. So DIL needs to cook for herself, since EVERYONE wants Aurora to cook. Besides, it's a waste of Ingredients to keep cooking inedible food.", "Honestly if they keep up this shit I\u2019d be kicking them all out, you don\u2019t need anymore stress.", "So a family of assholes being assholes? \ud83d\ude02", "So why are you not correcting this behaviour", "And... isn't it YOUR JOB as the adults to help Aurora grow up to NOT be an A. So put boundaries.", "It\u2019s not Aurora\u2019s home. Try being the adult in the situation and tell her she needs to make something everybody can eat or she can have dinner at home for now.", "But DIL is at your house trying to help your and your wife by cooking but yet  you are allowing your GD to treat her disrespectfully - and you can't see how YTA?", "You sound like a treat", "OP says in the post that she makes sure the food is something her aunt won't eat and mentions in the comments that DIL has sensory issues with food.", "Read the comments, OP said this in a thread lol.", "Eh, so don\u2019t eat at same time?  Pre-make a salad or sides you can eat with everyone, then have a main separate.  You can work around stuff like that if you want to", "Idk if you came here fully expecting a flood of support and are upset you didnt receive it or what but its a clear E S H with a hard left into YTA. Your attitude about all this stinks I have to say. All your comments are pretty damning.", "Why doesn\u2019t Kevin\u2019s son step up and cook? Since Kevin and you supposedly have suuuuch long hours so it\u2019s just impossible for either of you to cook.\n\nThe boy has to contribute to the household somehow, right? Just the way you say his mom should. He\u2019s a teenager and he\u2019s living there whereas Aurora is over only for dinner so why isn\u2019t he taking over for his mom?", "You missed the part where OP says cooking isn't his job, but DIL is a SAHM so it's her job to cook because she's a mom.  OP is TA here.", "She insists on doing it in order to be mean. You state in another comment that she hates your DIL and wants to drive her away. If she \u201cinsisted\u201d on insulting your DIL\u2019s outfit every morning would you just say \u201cwell she insists on doing it\u201d? That\u2019s the same level of meanness that she\u2019s enacting by \u201cinsisting\u201d on cooking. You either need to let her cook but make it clear she needs to be more accommodating or take back over cooking in order to re-instill peace in the house.", "She's a teenager. You do not have to do what she says", "You let her even though you know she\u2019ll cook something your DIL can\u2019t ear?

That poor woman, no wonder she\u2019s snapping.", "Temporarily. Technically they're just guests for a few months and his other son and Aurora are going to be eating there long after DIL and fam moves out.

All the AHs, all the time.", "Because he wants to be able to eat edible food! He says DIL is a bad cook so I think that plays a big part in this. The best scenario for everyone is for DIL to cook her own food so that everyone gets to eat. I wouldn't be surprised if everyone else is low key hoping Aurora keeps cooking.\n\nEdit: On top of that, reading from comments, DIL's own husband and son also wants Aurora to keep cooking because they say that they don't get to eat much good food.

It must be bad if her own family wants to keep Aurora around even when she don't get to eat the food.", "Yeah I opened all the threads and can't seem to find that anywhere.\n\nDoes anybody care to link this missing comment?", "I read through all the comments and do not see this.  Perhaps OP deleted it?", "or just. eat separately. the bad cook can eat her bad food with her husband and children and the rude child can eat with her dad, grandma and her sexist grandpa. or sexist grandpa can stop resenting his dil and just kick them out, since having them there rent free bugs him so much. idk. this is so petty. was about to ask who raised these people, but. well. esh.", "Yuuup.

OP you were given the adult solution and you rejected it. This will work if someone there has the balls to put their foot down. Since you are the elder supposedly in control it should be YOU!

Don't like it?  Renegotiate.  My wife cooks dinner during my busy season when I work overtime and she only works 3 days a week.  That's our arrangement.  If she didn't like it...well we'd be eating takeout at 10:30pm cuz that's when I get home but if she wanted to do that we'd do it.  It's a partnership.  You communicate your needs and find a compromise.  Just because YOU don't agree with the arrangement in their home doesn't mean OP is the asshole just because he's not cooking dinner every night.

I hate misogyny and toxic masculinity with a passion, but I think there\u2019s a huge leap to say this is the reason behind expecting her to contribute while she\u2019s living there.
