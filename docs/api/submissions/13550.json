We didn't have a feral animal problem and the fence was installed when we moved in so it was new and lacked an escape route for adventurous animals. She was only out there for about 10 minutes before I went out to retrieve her only to find her gone. There was no hole in the fences, and the gates still firmly closed. My grandmother broke down, and we spent the whole weekend putting up flyers and looking for the dog.\n\nEventually, we got a call. It was from a man. Apparently, he'd been doing some yard work in our next-door neighbor's yard, saw the dog, and decided to TAKE HER and give her to his kids. He even said, \"I just wanted to let you guys know, so you'd stop looking for her. I've already given her to my kids, and we've renamed her Oreo.\"\n\nThis went over very poorly in my house. We immediately went to the neighbors and got the info for the man and called the police. Luckily, we had all her vet information, including her microchip info and papers (she was a registered pure breed). The man and his wife tried to guilt trip the officers and my birth giver saying that the kids had become attached and we clearly didn't care about \"Oreo\" or else why would we have left her in the backyard?

NTA at all, everyone else is here", "I kinda feel like your mom doesn't like your dog, and this was a perfect excuse to talk you into getting rid of him.\n\nAlso, I would get your dog chipped so there's never and question about him being your fur baby", "Does your mom live with you?", "Your mum is stupid and clearly hates your dog. I would love to ask her how she excused their thievery. Let's see the mental gymnastics firsthand.", "Is your dog chipped? Get a chip reader and keep it handy.", "[removed]", "Unless the mom sold them the dog", "Well my bad, these are your parents now!", "Op needs to do a DNA test.", "Get a chip immediately! Make it GPS! You can prove he is yours in heartbeat! Your mom needs a doctor! WTF is wrong with her?", "The only caveat I would add to this is that for some breeds, two individual dogs can look _incredibly_ similar. Trying to reach op from the wife's arms doesn't tell us much, because lots of dogs would do that. Responding to someone calling over a fence also doesn't really establish anything.\n\nWhat would establish that its the same dog is a microchip.", "Ya I can't help but to feel like there's more to this and of course no response from the account on this makes it even more suspicious.", "That is why you should get all your pets chipped. I have chipped my cats, my dog and my horse. If they ever go missing or get stolen and they resurface people will call me inmediately. In my country there is a database where you can check chip numbers very easily. I don\u2019t know if every country has a website this easy.", "Clone and Cheerio. Identical orange kitties. Cheerio belonged to my mom and was fixed. Clone belonged to my neighbors and was not fixed. We lost Cheerio to the neighborhood red tail hawks and Clone wandered into our yard a few days later. My parents honestly thought Clone was Cheerio! My dad noticed the one physical difference when Clone stuck his butt in my dad's face while being petted. My parents returned Clone to my neighbors and apologized. Everyone laughed and Clone kept his nickname.", "There\u2019s been a ton of response from the acct wdym?", "I mean, 5 comments isn\u2019t a ton, and a lot of questions left unanswered."]}
