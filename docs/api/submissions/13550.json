I am not affiliated with that post in any way. My dog slipped through a hole in the fence that I was unaware about. I looked for my dog for about 3-4 hours before posting on the neighborhood Facebook page asking for any information. He had dog tags so there couldn\u2019t be any confusion on who the dog belonged to. I looked again the next day and I saw him through my neighbors window. I figured they found him and were getting ready to call me so I knocked on their door and told them that\u2019s my dog. My dog was clearly trying to scratch his way out of the wife\u2019s arms but they claimed it was their dog. I also noticed they removed the dog tags I put on him. Their fence wasn\u2019t the tallest so I waited until they let him out back to run then I called him and he came running I was able to grab him from over the fence. Once they noticed he was gone they came pounding on my door. I didn\u2019t answer it because I was worried that the husband would forcibly take my dog from me. After 10-15 minutes of them knocking they got the police involved. I told the officer that this was my dog and they took the dog tags off of him so I couldn\u2019t easily prove it. I have all the paperwork for the dog so they can\u2019t legally prove it\u2019s their dog. I gave the cop the paperwork and he helped me kick them off of my property. I told my mom what happened and she said what I did was despicable and I should give him back to them.

I seriously don't understand why your mother is saying you are one. That dog was trying to escape and come back to you. The police proved he was yours. That dog is yours and clearly, he has affection for you. I would personally not forgive mother so easily if she said that. I love my pets and the idea of them being stolen scares me every day.

Your mother thinks it\u2019s despicable you took your own dog back from the people who stole it?   \nofcourse nta, get the dog microchipped and don\u2019t leave him alone outside.

If your dog gets out again and they can get him to a vet and have him chipped before you do then he would legally be THEIR dog! No court would give him back to you. Watch Neighbor Wars and you\u2019ll find the episode with this exact same scenario on it! Good luck and maybe try an air tag hidden somewhere on him that can\u2019t be found till you get him chipped! Good luck!!", "NTA. You should have called the police first though.

You were tresspassing though, but for a good reason (to get your stolen dog back). \n\nI don\u2019t like seeing dogs or animals in general as property because they are living creatures but for the lack of a better word in legal ways I call them this way. \n\nGet your dog chipped at a local vet.

It's not like it was a bicycle or lawn equipment. It's your dog! Personally, I probably would have immediately called the police as soon as they refused to give him to you and stood on the sidewalk in front of their house until the police arrived, but that's just me.

It will make things so much easier if they try this again as they can't easily remove a microchip like they did the dog tags", "You should still get your dog chipped and registered to you. Chips are useless unless you register them afterwards, so don't skip that part. It is easy and relatively inexpensive. It is also an easy way to prove who the owner is because it can't just be taken off unlike tags. Tags are still good to have, but as you learned they can be easily taken off and disposed of. Vets will generally check animals for chips if they had ever tried to take the dog to a vet to create a paper trail of their own. You could have just as easily not seen the dog at their place and lost your dog forever. Learn from your lesson that there are strange people in the world and it is better to have your bases covered with keeping your pets safe because accidents happen.", "I'm just saying - either you KNOW it is your dog or you know it isn't. If it is your dog, then there is no way you can be the AH!", "Regardless, get the dog chipped. Stupid not to and it isn't that expensive and not super painful per our vet.  Ours are chipped, one of the first things we did. Did it at the same time they were spayed.", "Doesn't your dog have a microchip? If not get him one!", "Trust, chips are the best proof. Paperwork also helps but so do chips. Especially if they take them to the vet.", "Also, if you move, don't forget to update the chip's contact details. A formal change of address generally won't automatically reach the chip registry, so if he got out after you moved, nobody would be able to get in touch with you if they found him."]}
