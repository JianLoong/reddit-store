He's building the argument around a straw man because he doesn't want you two to address the actual problem - that he does not respect your choices about your own body.

Especially if you take into account where you get them done (Claire's vs a actual studio for instance. Please for the love of all things good. GO TO A STUDIO) and what body part is pierced. Ears lobes (basic ones) are insanely different than say a nose or lip or tongue and don't get me started when it comes to nipples and down below the belt. \n\nAlso it's simple really. You said NO he needs to respect that or he needs to GTFO the door and never Darken it again unless it is to apologize to you for being an ass.\n\nNever change anything about yourself to please another. Because it'll likely NEVER be enough to make them happy. First it's a piercing then another and another before long you're covered, then he'll demand tattoos be covered or redone or new ones, hair and clothes next, personality changes etc. People like that can never be happy with the one change.\n\nAnd the fact he won't respect the first NO makes me concerned that he won't respect any more serious NOs you use. For instance \"NO don't touch me\" or \"NO I don't want sex tonight\". All of this is bodily autonomy. You said NO he kept pushing. And turned it into a guilt trip and is playing on your emotions and twisting your words \"you hate piercings and find them ugly so that means you find me disgusting and you aren't truly attracted to me\" yea that's a red becon flashing of behavior warning signs.\n\nYou really need to reevaluate this relationship. If he can't respect your NO is he even worth being around? Seriously. You deserve a partner that respects NO regardless how they feel and doesn't keep pushing and pressuring you and being an ass about it.\n\nIf you wouldn't do it to someone else, then why should you allow it to be done to you?\n\nUse that. If you wouldn't act the way he does to someone else, then why would you deserve that kind of behavior towards you. \n\nBe safe.

That sort of thing never ends well.", "NTA!  Dump him.  Anyone pressuring you to make permanent changes to your body is a controlling prick.  \nGood for you having enough self esteem to say no.", "NTA. I completely understand that. I LOVE tattoos on people, I find them amazing and it even makes me find them more attractive, and for a loooong time I wanted to get a lot of them myself. Well, I finally saved enough to get one and while I don't really hate it, I just don't find it pretty on me. I wish I could take it back but obviously I can't. So yeah, I still find them awesome on others, but not on me. Meanwhile you don't find then anesthetically pleasing for you and that's okay. Your boyfriend needs to understand that no means no. You set some boundaries many times (from what I can understand) and he's not listening, plus now he's acting like a child because you understandably snapped.", "NTA - it's very weird of him to try to pressure you into something like that. It's terrible to ignore it when somebody says NO.\n\nI've known my boyfriend since we were 12 and 13, we split up for a while and one of his girlfriends pressured him into getting his ears pierced. When he and I got back together I thought it was so strange that he'd done it because it just wasn't \"him\" - he STILL regrets it and the permanent hole marks bother him. Even \"one ear piercing\" will likely leave a long term or permanent mark. Stand your ground!\n\nThis behavior may be a huge red flag", "NTA- Why are you with someone who cannot respect your body, your choice? Major red flag. You don\u2019t get a piercing or a tattoo for someone else, because you want something to do, to be \u201ccool\u201d, etc. Those are the ones you will regret. You let him pressure him into something like a piercing, sure you can take it out and it will heal. \u2026but there might be some resentment too.", "Exactly! OP, tell your bf that his pressuring of you caused you to start to believe he finds you lacking because you won't get a piercing. He was doing the same thing he's accusing you of doing. \n\nNTA"]}
