Especially if you take into account where you get them done (Claire's vs a actual studio for instance. Please for the love of all things good. GO TO A STUDIO) and what body part is pierced. Ears lobes (basic ones) are insanely different than say a nose or lip or tongue and don't get me started when it comes to nipples and down below the belt. \n\nAlso it's simple really.

And now it sounds like he's manipulating her, \"I pushed your boundaries until you snapped, and now I'm hurt. I guess the only way I'll feel better about this is if you get a piercing. Then, I know you like them on me too.\"", "Actually, saying that\u2019s the only part of bf\u2019s actions here I am neutral on because it could well be true. I have a partner I\u2019ve been with for years, and if they were to tell me they didn\u2019t think x body part or mod was aesthetically pleasing, as opposed to saying it\u2019s something that\u2019s not my personal style right now - or something else that doesn\u2019t carry a possible negative meaning - I\u2019d worry for god knows how long that my partner thinks I\u2019m gross and ugly and is just staying with me because they think they have to. Body dysmorphia is pretty common, and one way of trying to deal with that is mods like tattoos and piercings. The latter are something you choose to get done, that are reversible if you don\u2019t like the results (and pretty quickly reversible at that), and aren\u2019t expensive to get done by a professional, relative to anything from a haircut and color to tattoos to plastic surgery, so about as good as you can get with trying to \u201cfix\u201d your body. I had a shitload of piercings I got starting as soon as I was 18, didn\u2019t help with my own dysmorphia, but I did like them all, thankfully! Some closed up after a few days spent in the hospital, and that was years later. Wish they hadn\u2019t, but the body\u2019s gonna do what it wants, and I guess it figured post surgery recovery was a good time to repair a few holes.\n\n\nYeah I\u2019m rambling so I\u2019ll stop, but I\u2019d give them a pass on that, unless OP says bf saying stuff like that to manipulate him is not a new thing, because you really can have such fucked up self image that you can think people who love you think you\u2019re disgusting.", "No, my tattoos weren't done with any other person in mind, I just thought they were cool.", "The second and third holes in my ear have not been occupied for 20 years and they do the same.", "Not her him. They're two guys.", "NTA!! I got my ears pierced 20 years ago and the holes are still there.", "YWBTA if you give in to his requests. You have a clear boundary which he completely ignores. He doesn't respect you. Because he is \"very hot\" is not nearly enough to stick with him.\n\nSo far NTA.", "NTA. No reason to get a piercing just for him, that would potentially last longer than the relationship.", "NTA. He's treating you like an extra body he can use for his piercing obsession. Everything else is just manipulation.", "NTA once you put a home in your body there is a mark if the hole even fully closes. Look at all the people who have pierced lips nose or eyebrows and take them out they still have visible holes. Its your body only mark it as you want as these things are permanent", "NTA but your boyfriend is. It\u2019s your body you don\u2019t have to justify why you don\u2019t want something done to it", "NTA\n\n\u201cnow my boyfriend now thinks that I find all the people with piercings to be disgusting, including himself.\u201d\n\nBy his logic, you could make the same argument and think he finds people without piercings to be unattractive and should take all his out to prove that isn\u2019t the case. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re feeling the pressure of this and I hope you reconsider this relationship because a partner should never make you feel bad for how you choose to dress/modify/not modify your body like this.\n\nEdit to add: you can find something cool/attractive but not want it for yourself.", "Your boyfriend is a sparkly spikey baby. The only thing that should be attracted to him are magnets.", "Your bf is using your comment about piercings to try to manipulate you into getting some. \n\nHe wants you to modify your body to suit his tastes, which is an A H move. NTA, OP.", "Sounds like he's making it about him after HE wronged YOU. Sus. If he was pressuring you and not dropping it, to a certain degree, your getting frustrated and lashing out was just a natural reaction, and even if you said something out of pocket about piercings, he should still be apologizing to you for nagging you about something you've put your foot down about. The fact that he was pressuring you about it at all is a red flag. It wouldn't cross my bfs mind to want me to change something about my appearance let alone nag me about it...I hate to say it but he sounds like an ahole and possibly manipulative by possibly being a little fake with his reaction to you getting rightfully mad. Cuz he started it for sure and he owes you a big apology and some therapy.", "Hell no.  He is for continuing to try and talk you into it after you said no.  NTA.", "Ugh, another person who thinks someone else\u2019s choices are a commentary on their own. NTA", "Or you could be like myself and be allergic to metal and then the pain is horrific and the holes never heal quite right.", "NTA. As someone who\u2019s had 18 piercings (all ears minus one nose and my belly button) no one else gets to dictate whether or not you modify your body. I can appreciate a full sleeve tattoo on someone else but not want that for myself. My best friend of 20+ years has a partial sleeve and many other visible tattoos, it fits her really well but personally I don\u2019t like my own tattoos in places that are visible daily - mine are easily hidden (ribs, foot, hip etc)\n\nAnd sure, you can take it out but it\u2019ll leave a mark. Not to mention it\u2019s a waste of time and money to just end up taking it out.", "NTA. No means no. Maybe he should learn it at some point.", "I had my labret pierced over 10 years ago and the hole never fully healed. I can stick a toothpick in it.", "For real. I have equal amounts of piercings verse tattoos. All my tattoos were quick to heal and are fine now. If I snag a shirt on my bridge piercing I'm left babying the damn things for weeks to make sure it doesn't get infected. They are two very different things. Op you're nta, your boyfriend is trying to make you into more of his type I would assume. It's weird to be so persistent about getting a piercing.", "I had my belly button pierced like 21? years ago and it's not fully closed either. My Munroe closed on the inside of my mouth but still has quite a deep imprint on the outside. My only piercing that fully healed and is barely visible is my vertical labret. I just have a very tiny horizontal scar on my bottom lip line."]}
