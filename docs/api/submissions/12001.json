I'm not a solicitor, but in my opinion You need to send them an invoice which is fully itemised for the costs you are claiming and state that they have 21 days to settle it, after which you will issue legal proceedings. It is imperative they are given formal notice in writing or they may cite a defence that you have failed to follow \"practice direction pre-action conduct and protocol\" (There's a .gov.uk website which lists all of these to browse anytime)", "Is there a statute of limitations for how long you have to sue them?

As a solicitor I can tell you I write my clients demand letters, I don't instruct them to do it themselves. However, on the off chance this isn't fake I'm guessing the law firms turned you down because there is a requirement in civil law to bring a case for damages expeditiously, that means you cannot forget about it for 2 years then file. You need to do it within a reasonable span of time unless there are extenuating circumstances - forgetting is not an extenuating circumstance. So  even if this is true (I have huge doubts) you probably waited to long.", "NTA. In the US you can add legal fees to your lawsuits.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
