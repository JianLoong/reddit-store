{"id": 24399, "submission_id": "15o792w", "title": "AITA for not paying my nephews\u2019 tuition?", "selftext": "I (39F) recently got divorced. It was my fault, I had a one night stand with a colleague, he fell in love, and when I didn't want to follow him, he sent \"evidence\" of \"our love\" to my then husband (John, 45M). I know I was wrong for cheating, that's not my question.\r All things considered, the divorce proceedings were relatively amicable. I really wanted to stay in our home, it's where I raised our son (David, 17M), and we found a way to make that possible.\r  \n\r  \nSoon after the divorce, my father (76M) was diagnosed with cancer. He always wanted to go on a cruise with the whole family, and is planning the big voyage for the next holidays (treatments permitting).\r But that time was meant to be time for John to see David, so I need John's OK. I brought it up with him, and he understood that my father's diagnosis changed things. But he didn't agree immediately, he wants to talk to David first. That talk hasn't happened yet.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, school tuition comes due, we send David to an expensive private school. John has an impressive income, and he's happy to pay for David\u2019s education.\r  \n\r  \nBut, prior to our divorce, we were helping my sister (Susan, 43F), who is not as wealthy, by paying to send her two children (16M and 13M) to the same school. Susan gets the bill and sends it to John. He responded that since they are not family any more, it isn't his problem.\r  \n\r  \nSusan thinks it isn't fair on her children to have to switch schools since they have both already been going there, have friends there, and would have to go to a lesser quality school. Susan and her family have been relying on him, and it's cruel of John to cut them off.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents think that because the divorce was my fault, this is my responsibility. They suggest I sell the house and come live with them. They have even found someone who would buy it, my cousin. I don\u2019t want to do this, primarily because of my parents smoking, but also it's not as straightforward as they make it sound. In the divorce we set up the deed to transfer the property to David after I die. John wanted to ensure that if I were to remarry, it wouldn't end up with my hypothetical step children.\r  \n\r  \nJohn thinks it's nothing to do with him anymore, and if there is money for a cruise then it's time for the rest of the family to step up and get them through this transition. In any case though, I don't really want to push back on him because he hasn't technically agreed to let David go on the holiday and I don't want to mess up my father's possible last wish.\r  \n\r  \nI feel guilty about the situation; I don\u2019t see a happy way of getting the money together. But I also agree that it is unfair that my nephews\u2019 will likely have to move schools due to no fault of their own. I wish I could help, but I'm not the wealthy aunty I was a year ago, I'm by no means living in poverty, but I don't have that kind of spare money either.

You were generous before,  now things have changed.  You have no obligation to your nephews.  Your parents demands are utterly ridiculous and totally out of line.  They are gaslighting you.", "I think they\u2019re putting this on you because they\u2019re upset about your divorce and it being your fault. However you are not those children\u2019s parents and you shouldn\u2019t feel any obligation to send them to that school. You can however offer to aid them as much as you can while they try to work out a way to afford the school. If no way is possible then sorry to say it but those kids will simply have to transfer schools. Also, anything that happened between your ex husband and yourself is strictly your personal business, they have not to right to hold a grudge about your past relationship or how it ended, it\u2019s your life. I\u2019m also assuming that your ex left you the house because it had sentimental value to you and if he insisted on it being passed over to his son when you pass then I don\u2019t think he would be particularly happy about you selling it to your cousin.", "NTA.  Your sister\u2019s kids tuition is not your responsibility. It was extremely generous when you could afford to do it but that time has passed, and it can\u2019t be done anymore.  \nDid it not occur to your sister that the divorce was likely to change things? I would have found out before re-enrolling for this coming year and taken appropriate steps like finding the money or investigating financial aid, or (God forbid!) public school. \nGiven it is mid-August, am I correct school has not started yet? I am assuming the tuition bill is for the coming year, so it\u2019s not a bill for services already rendered and they\u2019re on the hook for thousands and no choice but to pay.\nSo the nephews have to go to a new school.  It is easier at the beginning of the year, and countless families move every year and kids have to start new schools and the vast majority are just fine.  Yes, your sister can be mad at you and that\u2019s ok.  But she is a grown adult who either didn\u2019t think far enough in front of her nose to see this was a possibility or she didn\u2019t think at all, so that\u2019s on her for the last-minute scramble.", "NTA for this specifically, but the problem with helping people is they become entitled to your money. Your sister sucks & instead of being grateful for the years of free money they are demanding more from you to the extent of leaving you homeless? Drop them all.", "NTA.  You never owed tuition to your niblings, you were being generous.  Your circumstances have changed, you can\u2019t afford to be that generous anymore.  You ex owes your sister nothing.  Your entire family is being greedy and selfish at your expense.  Sure, your niece and nephew may have to change schools, and maybe that isn\u2019t fair.  Or maybe they were super lucky that they had a generous aunt and uncle who could pay their tuition to private school for a few years, and they should be grateful for that and love you just as much now as the did when you had a rich husband.  Stay in your house, don\u2019t sell, tell sis and the niblings you love them and you\u2019re sorry you can\u2019t afford their tuition.", "John is right: not his family anymore.

You need to stop defending your family and understand that this is a totally valid decision on John\u2019s part. DO NOT try to convince him. You lost that right when you cheated. And for the love of god DO NOT let your family harass John over this. If they want the tuition paid, they need to take care of it themselves. It was never Johns responsibility. You need to tell your family that he is no longer related to them. He has nothing to do with them. Put your foot down Jesus Christ.", "The school should have needs based tuition and/or payment plans, else the parents can get student loans for their kids. They are not your responsibility. Though there is possibly a case where if your ex husband's income was factored into their tuition requirements that he could legally be on the hook, but that would be a debate between the ex and the nephew's parents. Please don't let your family take your son's house, and don't let them continue to manipulate you based on your infidelity.

That is also David's home, and I'm sure it's not in your son's best interests to finish out his childhood uprooted and living like a poor relation in the spare room of some elderly chainsmokers.
