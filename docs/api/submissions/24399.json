{"id": 24399, "submission_id": "15o792w", "title": "AITA for not paying my nephews\u2019 tuition?", "selftext": "I (39F) recently got divorced. It was my fault, I had a one night stand with a colleague, he fell in love, and when I didn't want to follow him, he sent \"evidence\" of \"our love\" to my then husband (John, 45M). I know I was wrong for cheating, that's not my question.\r All things considered, the divorce proceedings were relatively amicable. I really wanted to stay in our home, it's where I raised our son (David, 17M), and we found a way to make that possible.\r  \n\r  \nSoon after the divorce, my father (76M) was diagnosed with cancer. He always wanted to go on a cruise with the whole family, and is planning the big voyage for the next holidays (treatments permitting).\r But that time was meant to be time for John to see David, so I need John's OK. I brought it up with him, and he understood that my father's diagnosis changed things. But he didn't agree immediately, he wants to talk to David first. That talk hasn't happened yet.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, school tuition comes due, we send David to an expensive private school. John has an impressive income, and he's happy to pay for David\u2019s education.\r  \n\r  \nBut, prior to our divorce, we were helping my sister (Susan, 43F), who is not as wealthy, by paying to send her two children (16M and 13M) to the same school. Susan gets the bill and sends it to John. He responded that since they are not family any more, it isn't his problem.\r  \n\r  \nSusan thinks it isn't fair on her children to have to switch schools since they have both already been going there, have friends there, and would have to go to a lesser quality school. Susan and her family have been relying on him, and it's cruel of John to cut them off.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents think that because the divorce was my fault, this is my responsibility. They suggest I sell the house and come live with them. They have even found someone who would buy it, my cousin. I don\u2019t want to do this, primarily because of my parents smoking, but also it's not as straightforward as they make it sound. In the divorce we set up the deed to transfer the property to David after I die. John wanted to ensure that if I were to remarry, it wouldn't end up with my hypothetical step children.\r  \n\r  \nJohn thinks it's nothing to do with him anymore, and if there is money for a cruise then it's time for the rest of the family to step up and get them through this transition. In any case though, I don't really want to push back on him because he hasn't technically agreed to let David go on the holiday and I don't want to mess up my father's possible last wish.\r  \n\r  \nI feel guilty about the situation; I don\u2019t see a happy way of getting the money together. But I also agree that it is unfair that my nephews\u2019 will likely have to move schools due to no fault of their own. I wish I could help, but I'm not the wealthy aunty I was a year ago, I'm by no means living in poverty, but I don't have that kind of spare money either.

When she eventually went on chemo so did the same thing and claimed it was the only way to keep her from vomiting after chemo.", "I'm sorry you made that terrible choice.  You've paid for it/are paying.  Your family doesn't get to make you pay more.  But how convenient of them to try to do it in a way that also takes care of their other kid.\n\nWas sister the golden child?", "Respectfully? Nice and sweet men are forgiving and do not disown their nephews due to divorce. He sounds cold, cruel, and punishing. I think you are so angry at youraelf for your mistake that you are seeing your ex with rose colored glasses.", "So people who get cheated on just have to take it?", "Many private schools have a fund for unexpected life changes so OP\u2019s sister should look into that. Most will also have need or merit based scholarships. They don\u2019t advertise them so it can be hard to find but are usually happy to give information to the parents that ask. \n\nIf her kids are decent students, they should qualify pretty easily for a long term (until they graduate) scholarship. If they\u2019re not then it is still worth asking but they might only give her some form of reduced payment plan or cover extracurriculares but she\u2019ll still have to pay full tuition. Especially since it\u2019s so close to the start of the school year.", "They will say the quit to move in. First they will sneak a few then they just stop sneaking.", "Why is it cruel of him to say \u201cI have no blood relation to these children and no involvement with the family anymore. I will not spend $50k (probably a low end estimate) sending them to school.\u201d?\n\nIt was incredibly generous of him to pay for their schooling in the first place, it\u2019s completely unreasonable to expect him to continue to do so now.", "OP is beating herself up enough and has lost a lot. Also, that wasn\u2019t what she asked about. The sister and other family members expecting OP to Sell her home to send the sister\u2019s kids to private school is beyond entitled. I am even of the opinion that they are beyond selfish. Just because you do something wrong, and stupid, doesn\u2019t mean everyone gets to stomp on you. The sister and family should be empathetic and even, heaven forbid, be responsible for their own families.", "No that is not what I said.\n\nI am, however, saying there is something wrong with divorce. So suggesting that a divorce the OP did not file for is 100% her fault is quite a deceptive read of the situation.", "So how should he have handled being cheated on?", "If you love your grandchildren quit smoking and use the funds towards their education."]}
