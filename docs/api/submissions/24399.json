{"id": 24399, "submission_id": "15o792w", "title": "AITA for not paying my nephews\u2019 tuition?", "selftext": "I (39F) recently got divorced. It was my fault, I had a one night stand with a colleague, he fell in love, and when I didn't want to follow him, he sent \"evidence\" of \"our love\" to my then husband (John, 45M). I know I was wrong for cheating, that's not my question.\r All things considered, the divorce proceedings were relatively amicable. I really wanted to stay in our home, it's where I raised our son (David, 17M), and we found a way to make that possible.\r  \n\r  \nSoon after the divorce, my father (76M) was diagnosed with cancer. He always wanted to go on a cruise with the whole family, and is planning the big voyage for the next holidays (treatments permitting).\r But that time was meant to be time for John to see David, so I need John's OK. I brought it up with him, and he understood that my father's diagnosis changed things. But he didn't agree immediately, he wants to talk to David first. That talk hasn't happened yet.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, school tuition comes due, we send David to an expensive private school. John has an impressive income, and he's happy to pay for David\u2019s education.\r  \n\r  \nBut, prior to our divorce, we were helping my sister (Susan, 43F), who is not as wealthy, by paying to send her two children (16M and 13M) to the same school. Susan gets the bill and sends it to John. He responded that since they are not family any more, it isn't his problem.\r  \n\r  \nSusan thinks it isn't fair on her children to have to switch schools since they have both already been going there, have friends there, and would have to go to a lesser quality school. Susan and her family have been relying on him, and it's cruel of John to cut them off.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents think that because the divorce was my fault, this is my responsibility. They suggest I sell the house and come live with them. They have even found someone who would buy it, my cousin. I don\u2019t want to do this, primarily because of my parents smoking, but also it's not as straightforward as they make it sound. In the divorce we set up the deed to transfer the property to David after I die. John wanted to ensure that if I were to remarry, it wouldn't end up with my hypothetical step children.\r  \n\r  \nJohn thinks it's nothing to do with him anymore, and if there is money for a cruise then it's time for the rest of the family to step up and get them through this transition. In any case though, I don't really want to push back on him because he hasn't technically agreed to let David go on the holiday and I don't want to mess up my father's possible last wish.\r  \n\r  \nI feel guilty about the situation; I don\u2019t see a happy way of getting the money together. But I also agree that it is unfair that my nephews\u2019 will likely have to move schools due to no fault of their own. I wish I could help, but I'm not the wealthy aunty I was a year ago, I'm by no means living in poverty, but I don't have that kind of spare money either.

I\u2019m sure his lordship will adjust.", ">yes I started a massive cascade, it was the biggest mistake of my life.\n\nThe least you can do is to ensure that absolutely none of your family's entitlement even reaches your ex. YOU tell them to take a hike and stop bringing up the previous arrangement with his money.", "So, why wasn't your sister thinking about that bill coming due in the months since your divorce? She had time to look into other options or request assistance, but she didn't.  Also, even if you sold the house and gave her the money for tuition...what's her plan for when the money runs out? Her youngest still has several years of school left....that could take up whatever you would have sold the house for.  \nNTA, btw. Your family sucks though.", "A divorce takes months to get through, especially when there are large assets like the house. That means your sister had at least months to know that her gravy train was ending. The fact that she was so entitled to think that your ex will just continue paying for her son is her being an idiot. She created this mess that she is now forcing you to fix. If they are on the hook for tens of thousands of dollars, then that is due to her own decision not to remove her nephew from school before the bill came due.", "The divorce didn't happen overnight.  That takes time.  The fact that they left the issue of tuition until the last minute is on them, not you.", "So they can borrow and pay it back. They can ask the school to defer the payment period due to change of circumstance and pay it back a few months later.  And the kids can try and apply for a scholarship. And if they cant pay for future years they better be so grateful for the opportunity they got. She can take the kids out of that school and work out a repayment plan", "Having someone else paying your kid\u2019s tuition is an incredibly generous **gift**. If the parents didn\u2019t have a backup plan for his tuition, that\u2019s on them.", "This would probably just be delaying the inevitable, unless this is the nephew\u2019s senior year or something. OP\u2019s sister has to figure out a way to come up with tens of thousands of dollars every year.", "Susan and her family have been relying on him and it's cruel of John to cut them off.  Her words.  Kids can still go to school, just not rich school.  Fucking spoiled Americans.", "No broker means nobody to tell OP she is selling the house for way below market", "They\u2019re smokers. Hopefully OP isn\u2019t going to stand for that around her or her kid.", "The grandparents smoke. Unless they are 100% strict about smoking outside the house (not even in the porch or verandah) the smoke will permeate the house. No", "This!!!", "You're more influential than you realize. \ud83d\ude09", "And it is also not OP's responsibility to pay.  The responsibility to pay for the kids education belongs to the parents.  If the parents cannot afford the expensive private school because they no longer have access to the Ex's money, they need to make other arraignments for their schooling.", "Sounds like OP did as well. \n\nDude might have been a secret monster, but considering he gave his ex access to the house until she died rather than until the day the kid turned 18 is classy and says a lot about his character.", "Yeah, this is my impression too. That OP and her entire family kind of used and abused the ex.", "Fortunately, there literally nothing they can do since the house goes to their son after death, and i don't think selling it now is an OPTION. honestly, im am kinda happy about this post because oop acknowledged her mistake and stepped up as co-parent and respected ex-husband boundaries. good for ex husband", "Minor correction. It sounds like it's the son's house, mom just has lifetime tenancy rights.\n\nSo her family wants her kid to give up his house to pay for their lifestyle.", "You can enroll whenever. They might miss the first day (schools in my county started yesterday) but public schools have to let you in whenever you enroll. It would take, at most, a week to get them signed up and in school.", ">Because of OP, Susan is on the hook for tens of thousands she can\u2019t afford.\n\n>Or she can send her kids to a public school . Lol. \n\nSome people are assuming that last year's fees are due, so Susan owes 10s of thousands for the year that already happened and transferring them won't eliminate that debt. Not sure why they think that, the post clearly indicates that they can't continue to go, not that it left her with debt that OP had promised to take xare of already.", "Except they're still asking ex for more money, knowing he was the party most wronged.\n\nThat's pretty low.", "Losing your family seems like a good thing in this case, since they clearly only see OP as a meal ticket.", "No innocents were harmed. No one is entitled to a lifetime of free tuition from their aunt and uncle. He can attend public school.", "You're ok with cheating?", "I agree.", "You can get an independent appraisal. Almost every mortgage out there demands one prior to signing off on a real estate loan.", "Yup. My sister's husband just talked her into this and she sold her house to his friends... Then found out it was worth way more when the buyers got an appraisal, after she signed the agreement. That AH just said \"how was i supposed to know?\" Well maybe because 5 of us told you that Steven! Ugh.", "The ways of the Redditors' votes are mysterious indeed. :)", "Eh, that\u2019s on them as much as him. As soon as I was divorced I was excommunicated from my ex\u2019s family. Not so much as a birthday wish or card from kids I have in fact known since diapers. (Teens and young adults now.) \n\nHere it sounds like maybe they want to keep him around to pay tuition. I\u2019d prefer excommunication\u2026", "My favorite aunt (who we saw a lot) divorced my uncle, for him and everyone else out of the blue. He was wrecked. He wanted nothing to do with us after that, because it was too painful for him, I think, and maybe to guilt trip my aunt a bit with our confusion and distress. I don\u2019t know, and never got closure.\nI really loved my sister\u2019s ex like a brother, but he ghosted us for ten years, and it hurt. He just blocked after a \u201chey, you didn\u2019t divorce ME!\u201d, and they have a kid. It\u2019s just how things go. I\u2019m now a little standoff-ish with inlaws, because these experiences were awful, but I think quite common", "Plus,  from all the memes I see, renting would be almost if just as expensive and there's no guarantee of staying in that one place at the same rent.  They might be priced out of the area altogether and then OPs boys will be the ones to have to change schools.\n\nIt could fuck up visitation with the ex too .  They are his kids and I bet he'd want them to grow up in a stable, private home.  Isn't that why he magnanimously made the sacrifice of giving up living there himself?  It would be a slap in the face twice for him.\n\nFirst for the ungratefulness of paying for his in laws kids expensive schooling and second to sacrifice his own children's security of a stable home for their sake yet again.\n\nSee, now that is getting screwed.  A lot of bitter male divorcees just feel that way by having to contribute to raising their own kids through child support even when they actually couldn't or wouldn't do full custody. \n\nOp needs to shut down her family now.   Her ex is looking out for her and the kids and her family wants to throw her out of her own house.", "That might be the case and probably how she was able to keep it in the divorce.", "I was just curious. I don't have children. So I've never been through the process of rolling them in school. \n\nI also wonder how their classes would transfer over. I hope the kids don't lose credits or need to retake classes. \n\nAround me private schools teach you nothing but jebus. So many kids that transfer the public schools. Need to take additional classes to catch up.\n\nBut this doesn't seem to be the case. With their situation.", "> OP is obligated (imo) to pay for the outstanding tuition debt.\n\nIs it usual for private schools to have tuition paid in arrears? I\u2019d have thought that it would be more likely that fees for the school year/semester would be paid prior to the start of the year/semester.\n\nDoes Susan owe money for the 2022/2023 academic year, or was that already paid for by John?", "She is not and never was responsible for her sister\u2019s children\u2019s education. Even if she was still married and her husband decided to stop paying for the school. That is the problem with being kind and generous on a regular basis. People start to expect it. The education payment was a gift and now that gift is not in the budget. The family should be thankful for the free years of education.\n\nNTA", "Do we know how much former SIL or kids are trying to maintain a relationship?  Do they call him, visit him, ask how he's doing? Or is it only about the tuition?  Relationships go both ways.", "Yep. It\u2019s also built on him paying their expensive ass tuition\u2026", "\"In the divorce we set up the deed to transfer the property to David after I die. John wanted to ensure that if I were to remarry, it wouldn't end up with my hypothetical step children.\"\n\nIt was. OP needs to step up and handle her family. \n\nIn a comment she mentions it's desperation. John wasn't pre-paying and they got a bill for tens of thousands apparently?\n\nFamily isn't hurting if they want to go on a cruise. Granted, money may not be refundable, but it's a point OP can bring up. They had since the divorce to figure this out, and wasting money on a cruise when they had a five figure bill on the way was a bad idea. \n\nAsking OP's ex or son to pay for their screwup should not be kosher.", "Of course she\u2019s not responsible for the kid\u2019s education, but her actions are the reason they are losing access to that education. They aren\u2019t just upset that the kids won\u2019t be able to go to the school anymore, they are upset with OP because her selfish actions are also having a negative impact on the rest of the family. Not saying that puts OP on the hook for the education going forward, but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to call Susan entitled for being upset. So I vote YTA cuz OPs selfish actions caused this situation, but NTA for not being able to pay going forward.", "I have to wonder, from OPs comments, how much John paid for lots of things, not just the school fees.\n\nNote her comment about no longer being \u201cthe rich aunt\u201d.", "Also OP could have given up more in the divorce to make sure her Ex kept paying for the nephew\u2019s tuition. Not saying she should have, but if she cared, she could have.\n\nKind of garbage to say Ex should keep paying when Op didn\u2019t care enough to give up $ to ensure he did.", "And who he no longer has to go to work for.  That money, that paid for the boys\u2019 private school fees, and all the money John spent on her family. I don\u2019t know how much, but take note of OPs comment about no longer being the rich aunt, and take note at how all her family expect OP to destroy her life and her sons life.", "I don\u2019t disagree with any of what you said. Her family is being entitled in asking her to give up her house to pay for this, regardless of if that\u2019s even possible. Even if the deed was not encumbered, I would still say that she shouldn\u2019t.", "I don\u2019t go out for meals if I can\u2019t afford to at least pay for my food.", "> It's like taking someone to a fancy restaurant they can't afford while saying \"Don't worry about the bill. I'll pay for it\" and then paying only your share and running off while leaving them to foot their part of the bill.\n\nIt isn't even remotely like that.", "OP has a requirement to look after her own child. \n\nWhy on earth should she give up her house, or anything else?\n\nIf you read her comment, about no longer being the rich aunt, I imagine that John has been paying for many things, one way or another, for OPs family.\n\nOPs family are incredibly entitled.\n\nJohn is not, nor was he, married to anyone but OP. OPs family are not entitled to anything.\n\nI have to wonder if your comment is a troll comment.", "> Doesn't matter what her intentions were\n\nIntentions always matter.  They may not change much, but they matter.\n\n>Doesn't matter whether it was on purpose.\n\nAn affair is always \"on purpose.\"  People make choices.   However, that doesn't obligate OP to pay for the schooling of her cousins kids.\n\n> She got that debt because of OP\n\nNo, she got that debt because she enrolled her kids in an institution that she could not afford, and then the funding source dried up.\n\n>so OP has the moral obligation to fix the mess she made.\n\nNo, she doesn't.  She had a moral obligation not to cheat.  She did anyway.  She is paying the consequences for that decision, IE her marriage imploding.  That does not obligate her to pay for schooling to an expensive private institution for children that are not hers.  The only person that bears any responsibility for the education of those children are the children's parents.", "I think you have to pay the tuition upfront for the year.

This is a school where you pay upfront, then get to attend. Don\u2019t pay, can\u2019t attend. \n\nThe sister needs to ask about financial aid. Those are her kids, so they\u2019re her responsibility. Not OPs.", "Well said!!", "I\u2019m confused, because op put her sister owes tens of thousands, so I took as it\u2019s an actual debt she owes, because it wasn\u2019t paid in advanced.
