{"id": 24399, "submission_id": "15o792w", "title": "AITA for not paying my nephews\u2019 tuition?", "selftext": "I (39F) recently got divorced. It was my fault, I had a one night stand with a colleague, he fell in love, and when I didn't want to follow him, he sent \"evidence\" of \"our love\" to my then husband (John, 45M). I know I was wrong for cheating, that's not my question.\r All things considered, the divorce proceedings were relatively amicable. I really wanted to stay in our home, it's where I raised our son (David, 17M), and we found a way to make that possible.\r  \n\r  \nSoon after the divorce, my father (76M) was diagnosed with cancer. He always wanted to go on a cruise with the whole family, and is planning the big voyage for the next holidays (treatments permitting).\r But that time was meant to be time for John to see David, so I need John's OK. I brought it up with him, and he understood that my father's diagnosis changed things. But he didn't agree immediately, he wants to talk to David first. That talk hasn't happened yet.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, school tuition comes due, we send David to an expensive private school. John has an impressive income, and he's happy to pay for David\u2019s education.\r  \n\r  \nBut, prior to our divorce, we were helping my sister (Susan, 43F), who is not as wealthy, by paying to send her two children (16M and 13M) to the same school. Susan gets the bill and sends it to John. He responded that since they are not family any more, it isn't his problem.\r  \n\r  \nSusan thinks it isn't fair on her children to have to switch schools since they have both already been going there, have friends there, and would have to go to a lesser quality school. Susan and her family have been relying on him, and it's cruel of John to cut them off.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents think that because the divorce was my fault, this is my responsibility. They suggest I sell the house and come live with them. They have even found someone who would buy it, my cousin. I don\u2019t want to do this, primarily because of my parents smoking, but also it's not as straightforward as they make it sound. In the divorce we set up the deed to transfer the property to David after I die. John wanted to ensure that if I were to remarry, it wouldn't end up with my hypothetical step children.\r  \n\r  \nJohn thinks it's nothing to do with him anymore, and if there is money for a cruise then it's time for the rest of the family to step up and get them through this transition. In any case though, I don't really want to push back on him because he hasn't technically agreed to let David go on the holiday and I don't want to mess up my father's possible last wish.\r  \n\r  \nI feel guilty about the situation; I don\u2019t see a happy way of getting the money together. But I also agree that it is unfair that my nephews\u2019 will likely have to move schools due to no fault of their own. I wish I could help, but I'm not the wealthy aunty I was a year ago, I'm by no means living in poverty, but I don't have that kind of spare money either.

Good riddance.", "I think you are assuming that everyone would still be angry with OP no matter how the marriage was broken. But the post is pretty clear that the family blames the current circumstance on op because she had an affair that broke up the marriage. So not sure why you are making that assumption", "Your own comment says OP owes it to innocents who were harmed. Why wouldn't my example fit your definition of harm 'caused' by OP?", "I think in every universe\n\nCheating > divorce", "going against her word???\n\nSo, you think that the OP sat there and thought 'well shit, I think Im going to have an affair on my husband, because I want to go back on my word to my sister to pay her kids private school tuition'. \n\nYou REALLY think she 'went back on her word' on purpose?", "No actually she didnt ask for judgement on her actions. She asked if she was the AH for not having the money to be able to continue to pay the tuition:\n\n>I know I was wrong for cheating, that's not my question.  \n>  \n>I wish I could help, but I'm not the wealthy aunty I was a year ago, I'm by no means living in poverty, but I don't have that kind of spare money either. Does that make me the AH?\n\nAnd it is absolutely NOT like taking someone to a fancy restaurant and then not paying.\n\nIn your analogy, it would be like taking someone to a fancy restaurant and paying and paying and paying and then something happening so you no longer can afford to pay and the person you brought saying 'YOU OWE ME' and 'YOU PROMISED' -- despite the person having paid for them for years already.", "Because they all know the reason for the divorce. If they didnt know the reason, the outcome/repercussions would be exactly the same. \n\nSusan is angry at the tuition not being paid, as if the OP did this specifically to hurt her. No one knows what goes on in a marriage, or why the OP cheated. She admits it was not well done of her, however, people dont just cheat 'for no reason' -- for whatever reason, there were issues in the marriage. \n\nBut Susans entitlement is as though the OP purposefully did this to screw her.\n\nAnd that wasnt the case - nor is it anyones business why the divorce happened. Had she not known the reason, Susan would still be angry because the tuition wasnt being paid.", "Doesn't matter what her intentions were. Doesn't matter whether it was on purpose. It's the end result that matters. \n\nIt being an accident doesn't wipe away the tens of thousands of dollars of debt the sister has. She got that debt because of OP, so OP has the moral obligation to fix the mess she made.", ">No actually she didnt ask for judgement on her actions. She asked if she was the AH for not having the money to be able to continue to pay the tuition:\n\nAnd she can't pay because of her actions. It's not some freak accident that happened out of nowhere.

It's still your problem to fix because you're the reason the other person ate at the restaurant and you're the reason something happened so you can't pay anymore.

It seems like you might be more forgiving of cheaters than most people. And power to you I guess. But most folks still consider cheating a bad thing to do. And if there was no affair there\u2019s nothing indicating Susan would still blame OP for this change in circumstance.", "Im not more forgiving of cheaters. I have an open mind regarding people making mistakes AND believe that no one knows what REALLY goes on within a marriage, and that what goes on within someone elses marriage is NOMB. \n\nAs for most folks still consider cheating a bad thing to do. Why? Its none of their business what someone does within their own marriage. Its between the two people who are married to each other.", "Lots of behaviors that occur between 2 people are considered bad. If 1 person robs another that\u2019s bad. If 1 person assaults another that\u2019s bad. There are exceptions to everything, but if your selfishness leads you to hurt someone it\u2019s bad. Even to folks who aren\u2019t the one you hurt."]}
