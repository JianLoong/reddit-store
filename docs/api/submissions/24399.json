{"id": 24399, "submission_id": "15o792w", "title": "AITA for not paying my nephews\u2019 tuition?", "selftext": "I (39F) recently got divorced. It was my fault, I had a one night stand with a colleague, he fell in love, and when I didn't want to follow him, he sent \"evidence\" of \"our love\" to my then husband (John, 45M). I know I was wrong for cheating, that's not my question.\r All things considered, the divorce proceedings were relatively amicable. I really wanted to stay in our home, it's where I raised our son (David, 17M), and we found a way to make that possible.\r  \n\r  \nSoon after the divorce, my father (76M) was diagnosed with cancer. He always wanted to go on a cruise with the whole family, and is planning the big voyage for the next holidays (treatments permitting).\r But that time was meant to be time for John to see David, so I need John's OK. I brought it up with him, and he understood that my father's diagnosis changed things. But he didn't agree immediately, he wants to talk to David first. That talk hasn't happened yet.\r  \n\r  \nMeanwhile, school tuition comes due, we send David to an expensive private school. John has an impressive income, and he's happy to pay for David\u2019s education.\r  \n\r  \nBut, prior to our divorce, we were helping my sister (Susan, 43F), who is not as wealthy, by paying to send her two children (16M and 13M) to the same school. Susan gets the bill and sends it to John. He responded that since they are not family any more, it isn't his problem.\r  \n\r  \nSusan thinks it isn't fair on her children to have to switch schools since they have both already been going there, have friends there, and would have to go to a lesser quality school. Susan and her family have been relying on him, and it's cruel of John to cut them off.\r  \n\r  \nMy parents think that because the divorce was my fault, this is my responsibility. They suggest I sell the house and come live with them. They have even found someone who would buy it, my cousin. I don\u2019t want to do this, primarily because of my parents smoking, but also it's not as straightforward as they make it sound. In the divorce we set up the deed to transfer the property to David after I die. John wanted to ensure that if I were to remarry, it wouldn't end up with my hypothetical step children.\r  \n\r  \nJohn thinks it's nothing to do with him anymore, and if there is money for a cruise then it's time for the rest of the family to step up and get them through this transition. In any case though, I don't really want to push back on him because he hasn't technically agreed to let David go on the holiday and I don't want to mess up my father's possible last wish.\r  \n\r  \nI feel guilty about the situation; I don\u2019t see a happy way of getting the money together. But I also agree that it is unfair that my nephews\u2019 will likely have to move schools due to no fault of their own. I wish I could help, but I'm not the wealthy aunty I was a year ago, I'm by no means living in poverty, but I don't have that kind of spare money either.

That dynamic change was your fault.", "It\u2019s entitlement that they want you to give up your house to pay for it.\n\nAlso, they will likely get into better colleges with more financial aid by going to a public school. The higher class rank, higher grades, and less competition from other students in the school will help them a lot.", "Ok, let me see if I understand what you are saying.\n\nSusan has every right to be angry with the OP and not be on speaking terms with her because the OP had an affair and demolished her own marriage. \n\nAnd because of that, Susan now isnt getting her two kids private school tuition paid for in full. AND further to that, Susan along with the rest of the family feel that the OP should be selling her house and then she and her kids moving in with her parents so as to be able to continue paying for the private school tuition for Susans kids. Because----------- Susan is entitled to someone else paying for (whether they can afford it or not) her kids to go to private school.\n\nHA HA HA", "This is an incredibly entitled take?? OPs ex-husbands generosity for years is not a given nor is it something that Susan and her kids are entitled to. Frankly, it\u2019s wild that they are asking OP to SELL HER FUCKING HOUSE(???) to pay for school for kids that aren\u2019t hers! If Susan wants her kids to go to private school and doesn\u2019t have a wealthy sponsor now - it\u2019s her responsibility as their actual mother to figure it out or transfer them out!", "Or, John could have cheated, or lost his job, or they could have decided to divorce for a thousand other reasons. Sis was NEVER entitled to tuition money. It was a nice gift while it lasted, but now it's over. Blaming her sister is an overreaction to a crappy situation.", "If I were OP, I  would see that as a good outcome - because  level of entitlement in this response is off the charts.", "Asking her if she can pay the bill is one thing. Telling her she needs to sell the roof over her head, the house that's supposed to eventually go to her son is entitled and utterly audacious", "Our 4 kids all attended private school. The school was very willing to work with us on tuition.", "It's actually hilarious how hard OP fucked herself. She lost her husband, her fancy lifestyle and is about to lose her family too. It's a situation caused entirely by her own actions and now it's biting her in the ass full swing. If this is a real and there's an award for \"best literal FAFO moment\", this would be a strong contender for 1st place.", "The only correct answer", "ESH - I mean, you don't need to sell your house to pay for your nephew's education, but you absolutely should have spoke to your sister about this awhile ago so that she could prepare for putting her kids in a different school. It should not have gotten to the point where they were receiving the bill assuming it would still be covered by you/your husband.", "Nah, that's bullshit.  Part of making right for one's mistakes is making restitution to innocents who were harmed.", "\"This is a really terrible attitude. There\u2019s nothing wrong with filing for divorce.\"\n\nRight back at you.", "Family didn\u2019t want John to keep paying. They wanted OP to give up her house to keep paying. \n\nI doubt the cousin would be buying the house in cash. Most likely a down payment and mortgage.", "Only because OP said she and John would pay for the kid's tuition. If OP didn't say that and then blew up her marriage, Susan wouldn't have put her kids in this expensive school and be left with a debt of tens of thousands they have to pay within the next month.\n\nIt sounds like the divorce happened within this past school year. How was Susan supposed to know OP would royally fuck them over and pull them out of school beforehand?\n\nSusan put her kids in that school with the information that OP (or rather John) would pay for the kids. If the marriage imploded after the kids were already enrolled for the past year, OP is obligated (imo) to pay for the outstanding tuition debt. \n\nOP should at least find a way to pay for the current tuition fee. Next academic year onwards, Susan is on her own.", "This is a bad take. Susan\u2019s kids won\u2019t go to that school as a direct result of her sisters affair. She absolutely has a right to be upset with her sister for that. Doesn\u2019t matter if the tuition was a gift. I\u2019m not saying OP should sell her house or anything, but Susan can absolutely be upset with her sister because the consequences of the affair have impacted Susan\u2019s kids negatively.", "I\u2019m not saying OP should be forced to sell her house. Please don\u2019t put words in my mouth. But I *am* saying that\u2019s OP\u2019s ex was extremely generous and that if I were her family, I would go low to no contact with her.", "I never said OP should sell her house. Please don\u2019t put words in my mouth. But if I were Susan I would be incandescent and would not be on speaking terms with OP.", "But the change in circumstance is literally due to her sisters affair. If the circumstance changed due to any of the other reasons you listed it would not be a consequence of OPs bad behavior. I think it\u2019s fair to be upset with someone if their bad actions cause you to lose out on something you otherwise would have. Gift or not.", "I agree that selling the house is extreme. But I would say there is a moral obligation as a sibling to TRY to make up for when your actions negatively impact them. There are limits tho and selling the house is probably past those limits. And it does sound like OP is trying to help. I just want hunk a lot of people are acting like OP has zero responsibility for how her affair impacted the lives of other people and that doesn\u2019t make sense to me.", "'Innocents who were harmed'? That's ridiculous. I suppose if John used to mow the neighbor's lawn but now doesn't because he moved out you would think that OP needs to cover lawn service for them. OP doesn't owe anyone, especially her sister, restitution.", "So there\u2019s nothing wrong with cheating? \n\nYou need to get better morals", "Except per the divorce decree ex gets the house upon OP's death, so she really cannot sell.", "Besides we don't know how close the cousin is to them even if they could afford to pay cash.", "So you'd go low contact not because they cheated but because it led to them not getting money any more?\n\nIs OP just a meal ticket here?", "So again, let me see if I understand you.\n\nBecause her ex was 'extremely generous' her family should go low or no contact with her for 'wrecking it for them' financially??\n\nagain\n\nHA HA HA", "Upset, sure. Expecting sis to cover the tuition? No.", "Resorting to false equivalences is just an admission of having no argument.  Stop while you're behind.", "Not ex, the son.  The son gets the house upon OP's death.", "If my fuck up hurt my sibling like this I do think there is a moral obligation to try to help/come up with the best solution. But it sounds like OP has been trying, and I agree that no real solution should include selling the house.", "I stand corrected. Same outcome however."]}
