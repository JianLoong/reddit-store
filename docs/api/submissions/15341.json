Definitely not the AH for packing up the smaller and more valuable items to preserve from the destructors. It might be a tiny bit controversial/petty to put chairs and other large items that you have no way to stop them getting to. Shoulda sold those items on Craigslist if you don\u2019t have need for them at your new residence.

And like I said, I wanted none of them there. 2 came as a pair, and then they invited their bf to live with us", "I packed up every single thing and put it in the basement. A lot happened after that fight, but im still legally allowed to come and go as I please. I wasnt gonna be petty but after I got off of work a few hours ago, I went to go get some extra things. after seeing that they took something of mine out the basement and began to use it in the kitchen again, Im going to be extra petty and take stuff I was gonna leave there, like cleaning supplies.", "Im really hurt about my golden and orange chopsticks missing and my brand new jack skellington mug being broken in less than 3 days of me having it. I also had a brand new mint green cooking utensil set that I never used until I lived there. I cant tell you how many times I found my measuring cups in the trash after being used as dipping sauce holders. And I also had a 16 piece golden forks, spoons and knives. After moving I could only find 1 spoon and knife and 2 forks.", "I often had conversations with her about her leaving with me. She went missing a few years ago, and when she found me I beggeed her to come live with me. She didnt want to leave her childs father, as she was pregnant at the time, so i bit the bullet and moved to where she was. Its been a downward spiral ever since. For the past 3 years Ive been fighting mentally day and night. I cant help but to think how much better life would be, how far along we'd both be if she would have come with me.", "Exactly. And I didnt promise them diddly squat. Most of that stuff was bought before I even moved in with them. I also meant to add that I have breathing issues which ive expressed to them several times which is why I couldnt handle th cigarette smoke., to which, of course, they didnt listen to. They only stopped knce I mentioned that the cigarette smoke gets to the kid before it gets to me, because thry dont like smoking around the kid", "When it comes to my bigger items that everyone used, Its just 2 chairs and a foldup table that was originally for my crafting. I stowed them away in the basement with the rest of my things (about 98% of my belongings since I didnt have a room) until I was ready to take them to my new home. I was never one to allow someone in my home without something to offer (if not money then at least cleaning and maybe cooking because I understand everyone falls on hard times) but I didnt have any say in the other people being there, which was enraging", "For it to be as expensive as it was, it really wasnt that big of a house at all. Factoring in that the basement wasnt finished and it makes the house even smaller because we couldnt really utilize it. And its so dirty, dusty and damp, I didnt want my belongings down there. Yet I, having the most stuff, was designated to the living room and all my stuff in the basement while the abusive, lazy non-working drunkard got the biggest room and her son got his own room too. It was only 3 bedrooms (the other 2 rooms were pretty small) and one bathroom, the house was mostly hallways and stairs. And that was another concern of mine. More people means less space and more mess. And such was created.", "Thanks, im crying now\ud83e\udd72\ud83e\udd72", "I recently turned 24. She's 26.", "A small storage unit might be needed, and please tell no one where it is, or what you're doing. Just start filling it up with things you want to keep safe.

After she sees you left for self preservation, not to hurt her.", "It's worth understanding that you covering half the costs for 6 other people is not normal, acceptable, or fine. And not even getting a room for your troubles. Move out quick and don't look back.", "Your sister is living in a toxic situation too. Her perspective and behavior is probably gonna be skewed by that too. Don\u2019t try to understand her logic.", "Holy shit. Sorry but I will have kicked everybody out or like you did run. Don\u2019t feel bad at all, as for packing your things better they realize now what they need to add on their shopping list.", "Yes definitely take all of your stuff out of the house as soon as you can. They\u2019ll probably hide it in their rooms just to keep you from keeping your own belongings.", "Smoking is awful enough to be around if you're not a smoker, when it's got additional health ramifications (on top of secondhand smoke) then they're just assholes. Good that they don't want to smoke around the child in the house, but a child deserves better accommodations than this.", "Best wishes in your new residence. You have been taken advantage of by too many people too long.", "I had so much money saved up and lost it all to get to where I am now and basic things needed here, so I cant afford a storage unit, nor can I drive so I cant rent a uHaul. Im not gonna go into details, but a lot happened during the fight. Legally I can continue to come and go to the house as I please, and I do to gradually get my stuff. But they have no idea where I am, not will they. And that makes me so happy.", "Wanna hear something funny? One of the people there threatened to kill me because I didnt get her son from the bus stop while she was in her room passed out drunk. I was then still expected by my other family member to cook her food specially and my sister was expected to bring it up to her. And help with her taxes. And be nice to her. One thing my sister bought up in the argumwnt was it wasnt fair how I was leaving her to be the only one to have tp cook or clean (it got to the point where I said f it and I didnt wash any dishes that I didnt create. Despite the extreme financial drain, I began to eat out a lot to avoid buying food for them. Dont look back? already have. Its only been about a week and im already so much more happier. Still sleepy though lol", "Forgot to add its gunny how the kid got his own room, as well as his freeloading drunk mother, who was given the biggest room", "She is living in a toxic situation, but ultimately she allowed it. I feel awful for her and I get angry every time I think of it, but at the same time I have to keep in mind that shes an adult and she chose that route and doesnt wanna leave it, most likely due to the other family member who is the quiet cause of all of this", "Exactly. There was nothing there that I wasnt utilizing that didnt belong to me, and the house I moved to has 2 other occupants so its already fully furnished and whatnot. I didnt really need to buy too much else besides cleaning supplies", "I know my sister has a few things of mine in her room. They disrespected me by going in my room to take my things, I'll go in their room to take my things back.", "He's a bad kid, but I know he's only a product of this mother. He lies, steals, manipulates, demands, bullies and walks around the house practically naked, just like her. He's already begun to be physically abusive (just like her), with hitting little girls and whatnot. I just hope it doesnt turn into using weapons on people in the house, just like her.", "Alas I have. It stems from my abusive childhood. Im hoping now I can have the time to really focus on myself and reform myself to be the person I want and need to be for myself and others with healthy boundaries. I appreciate you very much!", "Mmm I will try to get myself out of that lease ASAP. If as you mentioned are not the best roommates, yes you can come and go as you please but you will be also liable if any damage.", "NTA\n\nCPS would have something to work with there ;) maybe after you remove your name from the lease?\n\nAlso, if they don't want you to take what is yours because they need it, maybe they can buy it from you (what you don't want to take of course? It would be a two for one: you don't have to move stuff AND they get to keep what they use and call it their own (finally).", "Hopefully after you leave she will see things differently and make a change. But that\u2019s on her.", "Help her look for her own place?", "You can sell it to them or marketplace.", "Yeah as you should! It\u2019s your stuff", "Sounds like someone should be reported to the appropriate child services then, the house condition on top of that makes it something they should be concerned about.", "Oh im going to. All of my stuff is in the basement and since most of the stuff in the basement is mine and my other family member said hes organizing it, theres nothing to damage that isn't mine. I am getting my things out as fast as I can though", "they threatened to call the police on me if I came back, so I threatened to tell the police everything. If I did, one would have a longer road to get custody of their child, one would lose their child to CPS and have to return to a psych ward, and 2 would be homeless because one of them would have to leave anyway due to probation and illegal activity cant be reported where they're staying, and they happen to be the primary breadwinner of the house so everyone would be homeless anyway. And I would still end up on top because legally they couldnt have me arrested for tresspassing, so calling the police would be a desth sentence to them, not me lol.", "You should sell what you can't take. Rebuild at least some of your funds, walk away from that mess of a house before someone hurts you and before they ruin everything you own. Since the new place is furnished, cut your losses and walk away clean.\n\n\nI've seen spiteful roommates trash everything people own while in the midst of moving.", "It sounds like the adults in this situation shouldn't have custody of their children, bad as that sounds. If kids are in this situation, they need looking after.", "...Why are you not calling CPS if this is the case? Children should have a chance at a better life, and there's care services the rest can reach out to.", "NTA - I've had a few non-family roommates who used and abused my possessions. I moved and hid things whilst completing my lease. My other roommates dealing with the same people did the same thing.\n\nYour family has some rather dysfunctional characters. Even if the property were communal, the lack of regard for communal property would still be appalling.", "NTA. If the stuff is yours, you will need it at your new place. How did these people end up living with you if you and your family don't know them?", "NTA. You owe these rude people nothing.", "Honestly call CPS"]}
