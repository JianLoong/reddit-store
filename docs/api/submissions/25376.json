It's your stuff and your sister is a super asshole for assuming you will fail in your sobriety. You don't need that negative shit from her and if seeing the glass collection isn't a trigger for you, then it's not a problem. Congratulations on your sobriety! You should be really proud.", "As someone who drinks water or wine indifferently on a (I think) whisky glass or on a plastic one, glasses don't make you drink alcohol.

I often use wine glasses for drinking iced coffee (I like the shape, it feels fancy). I also use shot glasses for eating tiny bits of ice cream. Somehow it feels fun to eat just a little portion. Unless those are actually triggers for you\u2014- and only you know this\u2014 there is absolutely no reason to not have certain glasses just because OTHER people use them to drink alcohol in other circumstances.\n\nEither way, they are yours to decide what to do.", "NTA.  You told her what she could look through, and she went beyond. You can put sparkling cider in wine glasses. And many shot glasses are just for decoration. Besides. They belong to you.

Glasses don\u2019t cause relapses. Besides you can use them for non alcoholic drinks and for serving  wine to guests, if you choose to do so. Your mother and sister are AH\u2019s.

I don't drink, yet ALL of the drinkware in my cupboards are wine glasses, martini glasses, etc.  I like to be fancy drinking my chocolate milk.", "NTA.

I still had them and drank everything out of them. Water, chocolate milk, wine, Emergen-C powder. They were great when I lost weight because it helped me control my soda portions.

She didn't ask, she assumed.  And everybody who thinks that owning alcohol glasses will make you consume alcohol is being absurd.

I am the alcoholic fuck up lol", "Oh it definitely is favoritism. She\u2019s the golden child and I\u2019m the fuckup always. Shes a college graduate and pretty and popular. I\u2019ve always been the odd duck.", "Exactly. Like if I wanted to drink again do you think it matters what its in? I drank vodka out of a ramekin once and once a bowl. Should I get rid of all my bowls and sauce containers??", "Right\u203d I was like oooh op is one of those fancy alcoholics who drank alcohol out of _glasses_, shit bro wine comes in a bottle and I got everybody one, why dirty a glass?  Jk but before I quit drinking  11 years ago I didn\u2019t own a single dedicated alcohol glass because everything in my house that\u2019s concave and will hold liquid could be an alcohol glass.  Normies have some weird thoughts about what makes alcohol a problem for us but that doesn\u2019t make it your problem.  If anything they\u2019re making these glasses more problematic by associating them with your drinking when you were thinking they\u2019re a nice memento of your honeymoon and trips with your hubby. Drop some AA platitudes on them and dip out of the conversation. NTA", "Thank you! I am incredibly proud of myself", "My husband would never let me keep something that was triggering to me.

Now I have a million fancy glasses and make precious little mixed mocktails with sodas and flavors and seltzer and whatnot and drink them out of fancy little glasses and feel special. Your recovery is your recovery, I\u2019m proud of you for standing up for yourself!", "NTA. If you wanted to drink, it wouldn't be the lack of a proper glass that would stop you. You don't have to give away a sentimental collection in order to stay sober and if you did, it would be your decision, not your Mommy.and Daddy's. They need to back off and your sister needs to take no for an answer. She sure is ungrateful.", "NTA.  your sister sounds very entitled.

There are two of you in your marriage and these glasses have sentimental value to two people, not one.  Why is your family ignoring your husband\u2019s right to keep the glasses?  Contrary to their belief, it\u2019s not all about you.  Your husband is entitled to keep anything he wants.", "NTA.\n\nAt no time in the history of humankind has anyone relapsed because of glassware.
