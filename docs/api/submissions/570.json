Is it recent?", "NTA. Sounds like there are many things in your life that you are not happy about. It may have affected your ability to enjoy anything, so the birthday party is just one part of the story. I hope you're getting some good therapy, because it sounds as if you might be looking to your family for validation and they're not helping you on a consistent basis, and could be causing you to second-guess yourself all the time. Whatever good progress you have made, focus on that, and hopefully the rest will fall into place with time.", "NTA but I think you need to see a professional therapist as you might be clouding your own judgement. You say that no-one cares about your effort, or about what you say or think. But then you say that all your family and friends came to celebrate your birthday. And noticed that you weren't enjoying yourself. That's still concern. Indifference is everyone noticing you're not having a good time and not saying anything about it.\n\nDon't always seek family or friends for validation or for the support you might need. They're just human. Always go to a professional who is trained to get to the root of the issue and build from there. You sound like you have people on your side. So many people don't. Realise that you have support but now you need to go outside of that for the rest.", "NTA. This sounds like depression, reaction dysphoria, RAD, PTSD, or something along those lines.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm no professional though so you should go talk to one.", "NTA - You sound depressed. I am proud of you for knowing there is an issue and seeking to understand. \n\nI would recommend a therapist at minimum. A stark look at life and where you want it to go is reasonable start. \n\nBest of luck, OP. Happy belated birthday.", "NTA - I gave some more detailed advice below.  Please tell your parents how you feel and ask them to get you some help.  Don't feel guilty, understand that a lot of people deal with this.  Please take care of yourself.", "NTA.  I hope we get an update someday that you got help and are living a fulfilling life.  Cheers.", "It's been a while now. At least two years ago, it started. My family just thinks it's a phase. But I have had my doubts for a while.", "Depression isn't a phase.  Do you know if depression runs in your family?  The best thing you could do is ask your parents to speak to your primary doctor and see if you can get a referral for therapy or a psychiatric evaluation.  \n\nI don't know how old you are, but I didn't realize until I was in my 30s that 1) I'd been suffering from depression my whole life and 2) my parents both showed signs of depression.\n\nYou are normal, there is nothing wrong with you, you are not strange, but you would most likely benefit greatly from some help.\n\nNTA and please take care of yourself.", "Heck I'm in my 30's too and the last time I was happy on my birthday was when I was about 7 or 8 these days I don't tell anyone at work when it's my birthday.\nDo I have depression?"]}
