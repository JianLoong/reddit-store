{"id": 7985, "submission_id": "10il1re", "title": "WIBTA for choosing houselessness during my family\u2019s time of need?", "selftext": "I \\[29F\\] was recently asked to move-in w/ my sister when my lease ends because she\u2019s pregnant again despite financial hurdles, going through the ailments of pregnancy, has a toddler, and is too weak to care for herself, my nephew, the house in terms of cleaning/cooking, etc and needs help. Her husband works long hours and is barely available, so she\u2019s with my nephew majority of the time and hardly gets any sleep.\n\nThe proposal was said to be beneficial to me because I\u2019m struggling to keep up with rent payments (my remote job cut down on pay while my rent drastically increased in this shitty economy), & I\u2019d only be responsible for about $100/month, which is a drop in the bucket compared to my usual $1300/m rent, but I was actually planning on living out of my car when my lease ends, work out of the car, and travel throughout the U.S while saving up for a house (I\u2019ve always wanted to visit the west coast, LA in particular). I\u2019ve watched loads of videos/read tons of forums of those living a nomadic lifestyle and are just fine so I\u2019m prepared for the highs and lows of car-dwelling.\n\nI\u2019m single, childfree & have no desire atm to bring children into a world in such despicable state (so to my family, I should always be avail since I\u2019ve got no real responsibilities). I\u2019m currently going through the wringer mentally (no one knows of my debilitating level of depression, not even close family members), so I can\u2019t even quite care for myself properly, let alone an agile toddler, a pregnant sister, and a moderately-sized household (I barely have the energy to cook for myself and would oftentimes go days without eating and, let\u2019s just say my studio apt is far from immaculate, but not deplorable).\n\nWhen I was proposed this, I explained my plans of traveling the U.S and I was told that I can always do so after my sister has given birth, but we all know that she would need even MORE help with a toddler AND a baby, so I doubt I\u2019ll be able to leave then. I fully understand that its not easy being pregnant and a mom, but I just don\u2019t think I can deal w/ the load of responsibilities this proposal entails. Also, they reside in a rural area, so it\u2019s not very suitable for young/emerging adults.\n\nTo make matters worse & not to offend reddit\u2019s religious folks, my sister\u2019s fam is Christian and I\u2019m not anymore (they\u2019re not fully aware of that news either), thus, I\u2019d have to succumb to an environment that would be unbearably uncomfortable. I know she, my BIL, along with my nephew and my soon-to-be nephew/niece are family whom I love dearly, and I know I\u2019m selfish to say this, but I just don\u2019t see myself moving in.\n\nSo, (TLDR)- WIBTA for choosing houselessness over moving-in w/ fam to assuage my pregnant sister\u2019s current dilemma?\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT:\n\nGosh- I didn\u2019t expect such overwhelming amount of responses! Thanks for your inputs, everyone!\n\nI just want to put out there that my sister and BIL are wonderful people. I don\u2019t think it would the case where I\u2019d be considered a designated nanny, cook, or housekeeper. Moreso a helping hand from family. My sister does these things now but it\u2019s killing her with the lack of help. I\u2019m 1000% sure if I were to state that I shouldn\u2019t have to pay anything that they would have me stay free of charge in a heartbeat. They know that I\u2019d prefer to pay something since I\u2019ve been independent for so long and I would not feel comfortable living under one\u2019s roof and pay absolutely nothing.\n\nI\u2019m the one they turned to because my mom lives in another state and that\u2019ll screw up everything, especially health insurance. I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ve got extra money left over for a live-in nanny because, from what I can tell, money is tight on their end as well.\n\nRegarding the car dwelling, I\u2019ve dabbed into it for a couple of weekends while living in my apt and figured out sleeping arrangements would mainly be apartment complexes, hospitals, and hotels and the couple of nights I\u2019ve done it so far I was able to get a full night of sleep. I'd shower in 24/7 fitness centers, limit food to OMAD (I'm petite), even at the mercy of eating out since I would be able to budget for that, be equipped w/ a jackery for power, and work at any coffee shop throughout the U.S, using their Wi-Fi.\n\nRegarding my mental state, I haven\u2019t really taken up therapy because of price but that can be something to consider if I\u2019m no longer responsible for such high rent payments.\n\nI\u2019ve read everyone\u2019s responses and thank you, each and every one of you, for your comments!", "created_utc": 1674398189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10il1re/wibta_for_choosing_houselessness_during_my/", "score": 340, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't necessarily need to move in with your family and if you do, you should pay a little more but set firm boundaries about how much you're going to help and what your personal time will be. However,  it's highly inadvisable to live alone in your car if you're struggling with bad depression. It would be better if you disclosed your issues to a close friend or family member and lived with someone while pursuing treatment. Also, being homeless, even by choice, affects your ability to get car insurance, apply successfully for jobs, and has a lot of other disadvantages. \n\nI wouldn't really move in with sis.

I understand that they need help but you also have to think about yourself and what YOU want. Also, you do have real responsibilities. You have to protect and take care of yourself, you have a job. I get helping somebody out when they need it but you shouldn\u2019t throw away all of your life plans because they decided to have another kid when they can\u2019t afford it.

The isolation and instability of a nomadic lifestyle are not to be underestimated. Keep in mind the nomadic influencers are not always showing the hard parts. You need some stability, and probably some treatment. I\u2019m not saying that stability has to come in the form of you sister\u2019s place - but you should be thinking about other options.

Yes $100 is literally nothing compared to real rent, but from what they are asking of you they should be paying you and giving you free room and board. If they wanted a live-in nanny they would have to pay one, they could probably get a housekeeper and trade rent, but they want more than just a housekeeper from you\n\nAnd if they are going to pretend that they don\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t count on that. You won\u2019t be allowed to just exist in your room when she needs help if they think they are giving you a good deal by charging you $100 to live there. You will be expected to do everything if you don\u2019t work.\n\nI\u2019m disabled and I can tell you that when I\u2019ve lived with people and I have paid full rent the same as everybody else that lives there they still expected me to be the live-in housemaid because they all went to work. Their attitude was that they are at work all day and I am home all day I should do it, my attitude was that I should not have to do more than my part I am not at work all day because I am disabled if I could stay home and clean all day I could go to work. Plus I paid the same amount of rent as everyone else there\u2019s no reason I should do all the cleaning. But it\u2019s always been an issue.

I don\u2019t think you owe them this explanation, but if you\u2019re worried about them feeling hurt and confused by your decision, explanation may go a long way toward mitigating that conflict.\n\nJust whatever you do, don\u2019t tell them about the religious thing right now.

If you're going to be doing all of that, they should be paying you at least free room and board and the 100$.  Moving in and helping my husbands grandfather was the hardest thing I ever did, I was happy I did it.  But, I couldn't leave to go shopping or take a walk or do anything.

If you are struggling to feed yourself with a full kitchen, fridge, and stove immediately accessible, imagine adding the barriers of needing to maintain a cooler and having to set up a mobile kitchen before you can get started cooking. Even if you have a built-in kitchen in your rig, you still need to fill propane and water tanks regularly and keep track of your batteries\u2019 charge.* Everything has extra steps when you live that way and if the \u201cregular\u201d steps make things feel difficult, the extra steps will make them feel insurmountable. \n\nRoad life kicks ass when you are feeling good and I hope you get to experience it! But I\u2019d suggest addressing your mental health first while you are in a more stable situation.

I\u2019d just add to make sure you\u2019ve got somewhere you can list as a permanent address, make sure you\u2019ve got a general practitioner who can do Telehealth so you\u2019re not stranded without medical care, and \u2014 pleasepleaseplease \u2014 *get mental health care set up ahead of time*. Meds, talk therapy, whatever works for you. \n\nAnd take care of your long-term health. Chronic conditions creep up slowly, but it\u2019s a lot harder to stop them once they\u2019re going.
