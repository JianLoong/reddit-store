However,  it's highly inadvisable to live alone in your car if you're struggling with bad depression. It would be better if you disclosed your issues to a close friend or family member and lived with someone while pursuing treatment. Also, being homeless, even by choice, affects your ability to get car insurance, apply successfully for jobs, and has a lot of other disadvantages. \n\nI wouldn't really move in with sis.

You need some stability, and probably some treatment. I\u2019m not saying that stability has to come in the form of you sister\u2019s place - but you should be thinking about other options.

While I think you were being offered the worst part of the deal (try to get a live in nanny /housekeeper for just a  room) it wasn't completely unreasonable. However a deal only works if it benefits both sides - and since it is not what you want this one doesn't. You have plans to travel and save money.

Yes $100 is literally nothing compared to real rent, but from what they are asking of you they should be paying you and giving you free room and board. If they wanted a live-in nanny they would have to pay one, they could probably get a housekeeper and trade rent, but they want more than just a housekeeper from you\n\nAnd if they are going to pretend that they don\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t count on that. You won\u2019t be allowed to just exist in your room when she needs help if they think they are giving you a good deal by charging you $100 to live there. You will be expected to do everything if you don\u2019t work.\n\nI\u2019m disabled and I can tell you that when I\u2019ve lived with people and I have paid full rent the same as everybody else that lives there they still expected me to be the live-in housemaid because they all went to work. Their attitude was that they are at work all day and I am home all day I should do it, my attitude was that I should not have to do more than my part I am not at work all day because I am disabled if I could stay home and clean all day I could go to work. Plus I paid the same amount of rent as everyone else there\u2019s no reason I should do all the cleaning. But it\u2019s always been an issue.

I don\u2019t think you owe them this explanation, but if you\u2019re worried about them feeling hurt and confused by your decision, explanation may go a long way toward mitigating that conflict.\n\nJust whatever you do, don\u2019t tell them about the religious thing right now. That\u2019s something better done slowly over time, not as a big revelation and when your mental health is in a good place so that you\u2019re prepared for the questions and confrontations that may arise.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nLet me get this straight.

I know this is a little different.  But when my in-laws hired a caregiver for her mother and father, the lady was paid 3k plus room and board.  If you're going to be doing all of that, they should be paying you at least free room and board and the 100$.  Moving in and helping my husbands grandfather was the hardest thing I ever did, I was happy I did it.  But, I couldn't leave to go shopping or take a walk or do anything.  And it did not help my depression.  I felt lonely and overwhelmed.  And you're right, after the child is born there will be more excuses for you to stay because now they depend on you.", "NTA. Do you, be safe and have fun!", "Info: if you are depressed to debilitating levels, how do you think you will be able to travel and live out of your own car?

So much of homelessness compounds on existing stresses. Finding showers and laundry facilities, continuous poor sleep, inconsistent remote work connectivity, solitude, lack of access to a kitchen, constantly shuffling your medication to new pharmacies. You aren't mentally in a place where you can manage living with all modern conveniences. Removing all conveniences and trying to recover is a really questionable plan. \n\nDon't take the offer to live with your sister, but you should work on getting well before taking your adventures.", "I had lived in a van for several years. It was fun, don't get me wrong, but it's not a lifestyle well suited for those with serious depression. \n\nMaybe if you wanted to live in the woods and not work would be one thing, but living in a car in LA will make you anxious and maybe even paranoid, in addition to being depressed. \n\nOn the other hand, helping others is really good for depression. Being someone that others rely on provides a sense of self worth, and,  although annoying at first, will bring you more joy and happiness than becoming a recluse with no family. \n\nNAH, but I think the decision you want to make is not in anyone's best interest, especially yours.", "YTA for choosing to be homeless while struggling with depression!\nI agree the Sister/Nanny/House keeper situation is not the right place for you either.\n\nLiving in your car is not some fun freedom life. You need to constantly search for a bathroom, eating fast food all the time is not healthy. I have lived in my car it is not like a fun short lived camping trip.\n\nIn Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego  have a HUGE homeless problem. We are working  hard to get over 97,000 people off the streets! We already have too many living in their cars we don't need more! The laws here are changing to make car camping illegal in an effort for people to accept housing in hotels that have been converted to low income section housing.\nIf you insist on this car camping idea good luck.\nDon't come to Los Angeles, California it's not safe to be living alone in your car. We have enough homeless we don't want you here adding to the problem!", "I disagree with you I think it\u2019s completely unreasonable for someone to try to bully OP into taking a live-in nanny/housekeeper/chef job where OP pays $100. I\u2019m not assuming malice, though I can\u2019t really wrap my head around the sister thinking that she\u2019s entitled to this, it is completely unreasonable to think that OP should even think about taking this deal", "I understand what you\u2019re trying to say. But they wouldn\u2019t be helping out OP they would be taking advantage of her. The only thing she needs to be worrying about right now is taking care of herself.", "Yeah there might not be another time in OP\u2019s life where they can be nomadic, employers are trying to take remote work away every day. OP may end up with other responsibilities that conflict with being a nomad.\n\nOP, I am almost 50 years old and while I never slept in my car, there were multiple periods in my life where I strategically packed my trunk in a way that I had what I need to float around for a while and I would couch surf, usually it was when I was trying to move to a new city I could get a job immediately but housing was always harder to come by.  And I learned pretty early on that locking myself into a lease with bad roommates was much worse than couch surfing or paying for short term rentals and then going somewhere else. You can get a lot of really fantastic deals at the beach in the winter, or at least you could before 2020 I don\u2019t know if winter rentals still exist. \n\nThe only good reason to stay with the sister is to help her and to save money, but it\u2019s going to be awful. I think OP needs to look at it last like helping the sister and more like taking a live-in nanny job and paying $100 to have it because that\u2019s pretty much what\u2019s happening here.", "I agree.  And I doubt that amount is going to stay just $100.  I bet it would only be a month or so before the sister starts asking for more money.", "Thank you I was looking for this comment I can\u2019t believe this person has been gaslit into thinking that they are wrong for not being a live-in nanny and housekeeper where they pay $100 to do that this is literally insane", "Me too its bull$hit. I know fulltime live in nanny/housekeeper and gets to pay for the privilege, are you $hitting me. What a rort. They need to employ someone not bully a family member to give up their life for them. Or at least offer a wage.", "Thank you so much for understanding what I was getting at and stating some of the risks better than I did.", "I\u2019ve watched a few van life videos and just listening to them talk about finding a safe place to park for the night gives me anxiety.", "Its the same in Oregon, Washington and BC. We are already trying to fix or mitigate the damage of HCOL on our residents, its going to be a problem when OP gets to the west coast and is chased away from anywhere she can find internet connectivity. There are no welcoming places that are suitable for remote work. This situation will devolve quickly given OP's fragile mental health.", "As I said she was being offered the worst part of the deal. And a lot depends on how much OP would actually be expected to do. But it's not something I would have agreed to if I had a choice.", "How do you know they would be taking advantage of her? They may be framing it in a way that they need help. Haven\u2019t you ever heard that people do that? To make someone feel less like a failure. Not saying OP is that but I am saying that this is a thing people sometimes do to help others out.", "Oh, exactly as soon as the electric bill goes up, or she decides OP eats too much food or uses too much toilet paper.", "I totally got what you were also feeling. I have two friends who went nomadic a couple years ago (pre-pandemic) and they're both healthy, well adjusted people but they had a lot of hardship on the road. They didn't have to work because one received a major severance package from his job so they used that money to go off on their adventure. They luckily got off the road before COVID, got married and settled down to have a baby... it was just hard even in a nice enough camper van. So many frustrating experiences trying to function. Add depression and an already challenging time in your car while working? Oh man. That's bad times.", "My friends who did it said that was a big problem. They had the ability to be offline since they didn't work during their extended road trip, so going to remote campgrounds wasn't a problem... but being safe in your car in urban/suburban areas is not so simple. The west coast from Vancouver, BC to the Mexico border want to get people out of car living in the major cities so its not a welcoming/easy to cope while choosing to be homeless. It is such a severe issue everywhere on the West Coast, OP is going to be chased away from places often.", "You\u2019re right, that does happen sometimes. But it doesn\u2019t sound like that type of situation. It sounds like they\u2019re the ones that need help and don\u2019t want to pay someone to do it. OP is expected to keep her job, take care of her sister and her kid, and possibly her newborn. That\u2019s a lot of responsibility to put on somebody. Even OPs parents said that because she doesn\u2019t have kids that she she should do it because she doesn\u2019t have any \u201creal responsibilities\u201d. Which isn\u2019t true. So they want OP to be a full time caretaker on top of all the shit she\u2019s going through already? That doesn\u2019t sound like a fair situation at all. If living on the road is what she wants to do and she thinks she\u2019s prepared enough for it, then it\u2019s her choice to do so.", "It\u2019s obvious they would be taking advantage, look at all the help they need they want a live-in nanny housekeeper chef and they want oh Peter pay $100 a month to take that job. Are you serious? Go look at the ads in your area for nannies or housekeepers and look at the salary they are offering for live in.", "How do you know that OP isn\u2019t exaggerating to convince herself she isn\u2019t TA so she can have a ton of strangers online who don\u2019t know the true context confirm with her that she\u2019s not TA", "Sounds more to me like they see someone who is about to be homeless and \u201ctravel the country\u201d confidently via research through trendy TikTok videos and is offering them a place to stay for a mere $100 to save up. \n\nPeople who are capable of owning a home, having children and jobs are not people who need that much help. They can obviously survive a pregnancy and children and working otherwise they wouldn\u2019t have gotten that far. Doesn\u2019t sound to me like they are asking her to pay to be a nanny. Sounds to me like they are trying to give her a leg up in life lmao", "Okay but how do you know that she is? What she wants to do isn\u2019t a horrible lifestyle. For some people it works and for some it doesn\u2019t. She could get on the road and figure out it\u2019s not for her and turn back. Or she could figure out that she loves it. Are you the OP? Are you the OP\u2019s sister? You are just as clueless to the situation as we are. All we can do is give advice based on the context that was given. And it sounds like despite OP\u2019s mental health struggles she\u2019s making a decision based on what she WANTS to do. And that\u2019s perfectly fine.", "  My husband's cousins are drowning in debt and his mother keeps giving them more and more money. Meanwhile, they send their kid to private school.  Adults with children make bad decisions too.", "Right but your basing your decision off of hypotheticals. And then trying to convince me otherwise because you think your hypothetical is more right than mine. For me it could go either way. I personally can never know for sure which way it is. I just want OP to elaborate more to me so that I can make my decision. But to me, it sounds more like OP\u2019s family is framing it in a way that will be helping her out making her think she\u2019s actually helping them. And that OP is relaying it to us in an exaggerated way. That\u2019s what I got from it. And I don\u2019t want to answer until or if  OP wants to elaborate!", "Oh don\u2019t I know it. It still sounds more of one way than the other to me. Which is why I asked OP for more info before I say they are TA or not. It could go either way, there\u2019s really no way to detail without more info.", "You are also basing your decision off of hypotheticals, what more info do you need? She still wouldn\u2019t be TA if that was the situation at hand. Just because someone is offering help doesn\u2019t mean you have to take it. To me it doesn\u2019t sound exaggerated at all. OPs sister is in a shit situation so she asks OP to be a full time caretaker without the pay and expects her to also pay rent because OP is her sister and isn\u2019t tied down to anything.   Just because OP has mental health issues doesn\u2019t mean that she can\u2019t make her own decisions or is exaggerating so she doesn\u2019t look like TA.", "Right but I\u2019m not trying to convince others that my point of view is right. I\u2019m continuing to say it could go both ways. Which it can."]}
