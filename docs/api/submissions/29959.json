{"id": 29959, "submission_id": "17jnksd", "title": "AITA for not wanting to go to my grandparents' wedding anniversary if my girlfriend isn't invited?", "selftext": "I (19F) have been dating my girlfriend (also 19F) for two years now. Her parents are very accepting of me and have invited me to celebrate Christmas with them this year. My own parents on the other hand have been less than thrilled finding out I'm into girls. Let's just say that instead of being accepting, they're more like tolerating it.\n\nThis coming weekend it's my grandparents 60th wedding anniversary, which is of course a big milestone. The entire family will be coming to the celebration, and everyone's partners are invited as well. Some of my cousins will even be bringing their boy/girlfriends of only a few months.\n\nMy parents however are not allowing me to take my girlfriend, saying they don't want me to embarrass them on this special celebration. Asking them what they mean by 'embarrass', they replied coldly with \"you know what we mean\". So I told them if my girlfriend is not allowed to come, I won't be going either. They ended up calling me disrespectful towards them and my grandparents, saying that it's a really important event.\n\nI have half a mind to call my grandparents myself now and ask them personally (they don't know I'm into girls yet), but I'm not sure if it'd make the situation worse.\n\nAITA for threatening to not go to the celebration without my girlfriend?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to clarify: \n\nSome people are saying I'm intending to make this big coming out declaration on the event. I honestly don't care about such declarations. I don't think there's anything special about who I happen to date. I just want to spend the event with my girlfriend and show up just like anyone in a straight relationship does. Nobody sees introducing their straight partner at an anniversary or birthday as problematic so it's weird how it's suddenly a problem when it's a gay partner.", "created_utc": 1698649453, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jnksd/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_grandparents/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ask them the secret to a long, happy relationship and use that as a get in to say you have found the person you want to live your life with, and go from there. \n\nYou can\u2019t be close to your grandparents if after 2 years of having a partner you love you have not spoken of them and introduced them to each other.", "Think of your grandparents. \nIt is their anniversary. \n\nHow about it just be family.....\nBoy or girl....not a date opportunity. \n\nThink of all they have done for you and stop the drama.", "YTA for how you are approaching this.

Your parents suck, but was your plan to let your grandparents find out by bringing your girlfriend along to their anniversary? Are there other people going to this event that don\u2019t know yet?

At their age, they probably would appreciate that you cared enough for them to know that you reached out.", "NTA Obviously they are assholes for being homophobic.\n\nHowever, a huge family event for someone else is not the time to come out to your extended family including the guests of honor.  How much of your family knows? Is it only your grandparents in the dark?  If so you have time to rectify that before the weekend and ask if she can come before making your choice on attendance.

I understand there can be a number of factors in this situation, but 2 years with one girl and the whole family isn't aware!? Hmmm....", "That'd be fine if no one else would bring their partners. But when my cousins are allowed to bring their boyfriends/girlfriends they've only been dating for a few months at most, why shouldn't I be allowed to bring my girlfriend of two years?", "It could *overshadow* their anniversary, not necessarily \u201cruin\u201d it. \n\nIf grandma doesn\u2019t know, the likelihood that others outside of OP\u2019s parents know is probably slim too. Whether accepting or not, this shouldn\u2019t happen here.", "Would you reply the same way if it wasn't wedding anniversary but a wedding and it wasn't someone announcing they are gay, but announcing they are engaged for example?", "Unfortunately the only way to handle this is telling them the truth. Unless you know your Grandparents are homophobic and want nothing to do with that part of you unfortunately all you can do is ask. \n\nYou are prepared for the fallout. You didn't say if you still live at home with your folks. Be prepared if your Grandparents say it's ok for anything if you do still live with your folks.", "Seems they conveniently skipped that part", "I'm definitely out, but that doesn't mean I have to talk about it in every conversation. \n\nIf I'm talking with someone and the subject of relationships come up and they ask if I have a partner, then of course I tell them about her. But if we're just talking about a movie I'm not just going to go \"by the way, I'm gay\".", "Yes. I'm sure that many of the other partners who will be attending are also unknown to some of the relatives. So if the fact that the OP's partner is same sex is *big news*, unlike a straight partner, then that will be a deserved result.\n\nIn any case, the OP is unwilling to have her relationship disrespected by bigots. Her parents don't what the event 'ruined'. Grandma is 60. I'm 58. That's hardly ancient. A 60 yo is more than young enough to adapt to new circumstances. Including a gay granddaughter.\n\nThe OP's decision to refrain from attending under those conditions is appropriate.", "Having a same sex partner is, in 2023, unremarkable news. I'm sure many of the other relatives with +1s will be bringing partners that the extended family haven't yet met. Big family gatherings are *exactly* when partners get introduced to the wider family.\n\nSo this is entirely unlike big footing a wedding with a proposal, or whatever. It is an unremarkable fact. \"And here's my partner, X\" \"Pleased to meet you, X!\" A banal social exchange.\n\nBut if you're someone who finds this earth-shattering news, you deserved that.", "The thing does the majority of your family know your gay. Because your grandparents don't and it seems like you're essentially using their get together to let everyone know your gay and have a girlfriend.", "Never in the past two years has there been a single conversation when it would have been relevant to mention your girlfriend?  If that\u2019s the case, I can\u2019t help but wonder how serious the relationship really is.", "If either of your grandparents have a heart condition maybe just tell them prior to their party and then they can invite or not. You'll have your answer and maybe avoid a heart attack", "60th **wedding** anniversary.  Grandma's not 60 unless the family is really screwed up.", "It\u2019s a 60th wedding anniversary, not birthday, so grandma is likely more around 80 years old.", "OP says that her parents are \"tolerating\" it and feel \"embarassed\" so I think the fair to say it isn't \"unremarkable\" thing for her family. IMO the right thing to do is ask the grandparents how they would feel and if she feels ready to come out to them - come out in advance of the party. Then not only they would know they would meet her partner, but they would also have heard a bit more about her - e.g. they have been together for 2 years! That is not insignificant time. So when they meet her they won't look stunned or shocked and will have the opportunity to show their acceptance and welcome the partner too. Assuming they are accepting, ofc. And if they are not accepting, I think OP would like to know that in advance as well, so to not cause extra hurt to her partner and just skip the event entirely justified.", "The fact that OP has kept it a secret from her grandparents for two years suggests it is a big deal.", "Yes. OP has exactly zero responsibility to accommodate her parent's homophobia. She should speak her truth and fear nothing. Any trauma they may experience is of their own making, and is entirely the result of the fact that they are bad people. She has zero responsibility to protect them from that. She is who she is, and will speak her truth. Fuck them if they don't like it.", "The issue is, OP is right now threatening to miss her grandparents event because of something her parents are saying. She should reach out to the grandparents so if she is missing the event, at least she knows it is because the grandparents are (potentially) assholes too. Not just because the parents fear the grandparents will react in certain way.", "Yes she should do something unexpected to her family, at a family event, that surely will help the situation."]}
