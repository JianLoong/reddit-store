Her parents are very accepting of me and have invited me to celebrate Christmas with them this year. My own parents on the other hand have been less than thrilled finding out I'm into girls. Let's just say that instead of being accepting, they're more like tolerating it.\n\nThis coming weekend it's my grandparents 60th wedding anniversary, which is of course a big milestone. The entire family will be coming to the celebration, and everyone's partners are invited as well. Some of my cousins will even be bringing their boy/girlfriends of only a few months.\n\nMy parents however are not allowing me to take my girlfriend, saying they don't want me to embarrass them on this special celebration. Asking them what they mean by 'embarrass', they replied coldly with \"you know what we mean\". So I told them if my girlfriend is not allowed to come, I won't be going either. They ended up calling me disrespectful towards them and my grandparents, saying that it's a really important event.\n\nI have half a mind to call my grandparents myself now and ask them personally (they don't know I'm into girls yet), but I'm not sure if it'd make the situation worse.\n\nAITA for threatening to not go to the celebration without my girlfriend?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to clarify: \n\nSome people are saying I'm intending to make this big coming out declaration on the event. I honestly don't care about such declarations. I don't think there's anything special about who I happen to date. I just want to spend the event with my girlfriend and show up just like anyone in a straight relationship does. Nobody sees introducing their straight partner at an anniversary or birthday as problematic so it's weird how it's suddenly a problem when it's a gay partner.", "created_utc": 1698649453, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jnksd/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_grandparents/", "score": 329, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People take the perspective, 'surely you can manage this and avoid making things about yourself for just one wedding anniversary.' But the thing its, there's always something - every person they meet, every room they enter, every job interview, social gathering, etc. etc., queer people constantly have to calculate who knows, who might be upset, what emotional or material consequences that might have for them or others... on and on.\n\nan increasing body of research shows that this chronic social management causes greatly elevated rates of PTSD. that sounds crazy, but it's what the research shows. It turns out that chronic tiny stressors can be just as damaging as acute massive stressors that we typically think of when we think about trauma.\n\nIt seems like OP is in an environment where this could have been easily managed if their family members were supportive- for instance by giving them guidance on coming out to grandma in advance of the party. Clearly no effort made by family there, so the result is that either grandma gets a shock, or op is excluded. Guess which option a lot of queer people usually pick? In some ways, it is limiting to reduce contact with family or build a mostly gay friend group. But it's such a relief to get a break from that constant exhausting mental calculus.\n\nOf course, in supportive families, queer people don't have this problem, because there's a modicum of effort made by people who care about them to ensure they feel welcomed and safe.

Some of these status quo rules of etiquette which would be otherwise very reasonable simply have not been thought through for all cases.\n\nI agree with you that it would be better reach out directly beforehand. For me this is advice to OP, not an obligation she has. At the very least so she can know where she stands and if it's worth going to the effort of maintaining a relationship with the grandparents. As well, to avoid exposing herself and her gf to potential discomfort or worse in a charged situation. However, if she decides instead to show up with the gf with no warning, and others are distressed by that, then as others have pointed out, that's not on OP. \n\nTo respond directly to what you said, for people in less-supportive situations like OP, sometimes there's never going to be a \"right time,\" so you go with a wrong time or you just don't go.

Holding queer people to the standard of \u201cI have to announce the gender of my partner\u201d is what forces these situations, and what allows for homophobic people to feign tolerance. \n\nBy creating the requirement of coming out in order to invite their partner to dinner without being perceived as attention seeking is what creates the divide and the perception of attention seeking. \n\nIt is extremely unlikely that heterosexual couples of a few months will be perceived as attention seeking for bringing their new partners, so why is the queer person perceived that way solely because of their genders.\n\nIt\u2019s what allows for people like OP\u2019s parents to be bordering on homophobia while still pretending they\u2019re not. The idea of \u201ccoming out\u201d is becoming less relevant in today\u2019s world because it creates an expectation that queer people are deviating from normal, when this is just what our normal looks like.\n\nSimilarly, if OP\u2019s partner was of a different race would you expect them to preface the rest of their family with that information? No, of course not. Because nobody else is owed that information, and would be putting a prejudiced expectation on that couple, for something that affects nobody. So why must we apply that thought process for their partner\u2019s gender, beyond the sake of adhering to an old oppressive standard?", "You see how that can come off as the opposite? Advice, rather than a question?", "You\u2019re still asking LGBTQ people to jump through hoops for other people\u2019s comfort. Which is homophobic. Are you straight? If so you don\u2019t get to say what is homophobic and what isn\u2019t. You need to pause and listen to the people who are LGBTQ who are telling you you\u2019re being homophobic.", "Exactly. Come out to the grandparents in advance, give them their own personal opportunity to be assholes or not about it. If they are as conservative as the parents suggest then their friends and family will be too. Turning up with your same-sex partner and coming out to them all at once at a big family celebration feels....a lot. Not for everyone else but for OP and her GF, I just wouldn't want to be the centre of attention for those people at such an event.", "Except OP specifically states that her parents are obviously homophobic (tolerating and embarrased) and she is actually contemplating not going to the event entirely just because of what her parents are saying. If she has the grandparents, which are the stars of the celebration, in her corner it will be easier to expect a less hostile environment for her and her partner on that celebration.", "I actually see now that a lot of people are reading it as if I am saying that she shouldn't come out entirely, rather what I meant and expressed in the comments - that she should do what she is contemplating and talk with them beforehand already.", "I think it's one of those things that yeah, it's technically homophobic, but there isn't a way to handle this without someone being homophobic. She shouldn't have to warn anyone, but if she doesn't, her girlfriend and her could be victims of a hate crime. So yeah, it's homophobic that she has to warn her family, but if she doesn't, her safety could be jeopardized.", "What is the hoop here? Straight people jump through hoops to present their partners and relationships in best light when they introduce them first time to the family too, I actually think this is the issue here. Making the partner feel welcomed in the family on this celebration?", "I agree with that and I understand your point. Hopefully that is the case and she\u2019s calling for support rather than permission. The expectation that the information is something owed and that if it isn\u2019t given it\u2019s seen as attention seeking is what is unfair to place on queer people. \n\nI apologize if I misunderstood what you\u2019re trying to say, and you meant it would be good for her to have support.", "You\u2019re being willfully ignorant. You don\u2019t have to call your grandparents ahead of time and say hey just FYI I am dating a person of the opposite gender and I wanted to warn you to make sure no one is uncomfortable. You are unfortunately homophobic and the beliefs are baked into you at this point. You need to do some self reflection."]}
