This weekend, she was graduating with her Master\u2019s in Social Work. For awhile, she debated on not walking across the stage, but ultimately decided to do it for her grandparents. She received four tickets for people to attend. Her mom, step dad, grandma and grandpa all got tickets. No problem there.\n\nI expressed to her several times about wishing I could be in attendance to see her walk. I\u2019m proud of her and wanted to be able to see the woman I love walk proudly with a new degree in hand. She never declined the idea of me being there, but didn\u2019t want to ask her Uni if she could have an extra ticket.\n\nTwo weeks ago, I reached out to her Uni and they were able to send me a ticket to be there! My plan was to show up, hide myself away and just watch her. I wasn\u2019t going to be with her family because I didn\u2019t want to take away from her time with them.\n\nFast forward to this morning at 12 am, I left Ohio and embarked on my drive to Illinois. I stopped and slept for about an hour and a half (that\u2019s the only sleep I\u2019ve had), then ensured I was at her graduation on time. I made it. As I\u2019m sitting in the chairs, I see her sitting down with some of her classmates - she hasn\u2019t seen me. A few minutes pass, then I decided to go surprise her. I walk up behind her, grab her shoulder and say \u201cDoesn\u2019t my love look stunning in her gown?!\u201d She turns around, shocked to see me, then that look changes to annoyance. She then questions why I\u2019m there and how I got a ticket. I explain everything to her, she continues to look annoyed, so I walk back to my seat. \n\nAfter everything is done, I\u2019m driving to my hotel and calls me to apologize \u201cfor not having the reaction I hoped she would have. I should know she doesn\u2019t like surprises.\u201d I go on to explain that I did it because I wanted to show my support and then lengths I\u2019ll always go through for her. She doesn\u2019t express any gratitude, nor appreciation. Instead, it was more \u201cI hate surprises, this especially takes the cake.\u201d \nNeedless to say, I\u2019m sitting here - tears in my eyes and feeling as if it was all for naught. \n\nAm I the asshole for surprising my girlfriend?", "created_utc": 1683391057, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139uy6q/aita_for_surprising_my_girlfriend_by_showing_up/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And she didn't want you to be there, and she wasn't happy you drove a 13h round trip just to see her graduate.\n\nYou might want to sit around the table and discuss where the two of you stand...\n\nNTA", "NTA, assuming you actually are dating. However, this is an imminent breakup that you should be prepared for or even initiate. Decent chance she has someone else in the college town anyway.", "Your break up is just a phone call away.", "Okay serious question but how long have you been dating? Because if it\u2019s a relatively new relationship she probably didn\u2019t want someone who could be gone in a few month in such an important memory.", "I think a breakup is in the future for you my dude. NTA", "NTA. Your girlfriend sounds... not great. Regardless of your feelings on surprises, if your boyfriend shows up from 6 1/2 hours away, you should be feeling happy feelings of some sort. I would be questioning the root cause of her annoyance because I doubt if it's her distaste for surprises.", "Info: is she really your girlfriend or are you a random stalker?", "I don\u2019t believe this. Schools don\u2019t just sent tickets out to random people\u2026 this isn\u2019t a sitcom. The irrelevant information def supports my theory.\n\nEither this is made up or your are a creepy stalker and not actually her bf.", "Kind of yes kind of no. You should know her well enough to know that she wouldn't like it. When she declined to ask her Uni for more tickets, that was your first missed clue.  She wanted to be alone with her family. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso it sounds like she may be moving on. I can understand not liking surprises, but if she was that annoyed, there may be something deeper going on.  If she was really happy with you, she would have been happy to see you even if she was surprised.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I don't think you are an AH, but I do think you are kind of clueless and not tuned into the signs- maybe you are not looking closely at her words/actions so she feels a bit steamrollered.", "INFO: how long have you been dating?", "YTA. \n\nAwful lot of \"I, me, my\" in this story of \"I intentionally did something of my own volition, on my own terms, contrary to what I know about this person, and I didn't get a cookie for it.\"", "You are NTA but you are the only one in this relationship. Honestly, I'm not even sure she likes you as a friend.", "Going against the grain here, yta, because she hates surprises, she didn't expect you, this was way to much. It seems if you had the relationship on the level you want it to be, there wouldn't have been a question that you would be there. It wasn't expected, so the relationship isn't on that level. So what you did seems weirdly controlling and stalkerish. You said she had four tickets and all were spoken for, so all your talk from you about you being there wasn't serious for her, since in her mind you wouldn't be there. She never said, yes I want you there, she just didn't disagree, which again she didn't have to since she didn't know, you'd get a ticket behind her back.\n\nDon't surprise people who don't want to be surprised and then get mad for not getting the reaction you wanted. \n\nI wonder how much of the seriousness of this relationship is in your mind. Especially since there is no mention on how long you are together, what your relationship looks like etc", "YTA \n\nYou said you wanted to be there to see her and she told you she didn't want that.

And you expect her to be happy about this?  She told you no, you didn't like the answer so you over stepped and reaches out to her school!  Tbh, I would break up with someone over that alone.   The rest of the post gets so much worse from here, but above all else - YOU WENT BEHIND HER BACK AND CONTACTED HER SCHOOL!!!", "These people saying NTA/she's hiding something are stupid.  Is it really so hard to believe that being caught off guard with something like this might bother someone? Some people hate surprises like this, me included.

She obviously had plans with her parents and now you're there it's incredibly awkward. Do the plans now include you? Do they exclude you? This is why you communicate to people. \n\n2) You made this about you not her by showing up unannounced. This is a big milestone for her, regardless of whether she was going to walk or not. Way to suck the air out of the room. \n\nI agree with everyone else, the breakup is imminent. Mainly because she's not that into you, and what you did was very selfish and shows a lack of personal boundaries. This surprise was done for you, not her.", "YTA. \n\nThe thought and gesture is nice, sure. That's not why YTA though. YTA because of how cringe you behaved after your showed up. That is possibly also why she didn't want you there in the first place. \n\n>I expressed to her several times about wishing I could be in attendance to see her walk. I\u2019m proud of her and wanted to be able to see the woman I love walk proudly with a new degree in hand. She never declined the idea of me being there, but didn\u2019t want to ask her Uni if she could have an extra ticket.\n\nYou communicated what you wanted. She didn't go for it. She could have been clearer and said no, yes. But that's it. She did not get you a ticket. Take a hint. As another commentator said above, stop making her day about you. \n\n>just watch her.\n\nCreepy!!! \n\n>Doesn\u2019t my love look stunning in her gown?!\u201d S\n\nMassive cringe. Why would you talk like that? You infantalised a grown woman getting a degree by yapping inanely about her looks. \n\n>She doesn\u2019t express any gratitude, nor appreciation.\n\nThis. This is the real reason you went. Not because you want to celebrate her. But because you want the adulation and praise of being the doting bf who drove so long to be there. You wanted to turn her day into your own ego brush up. She deserves to be pissed. Stop making this about you. Reflect on your actual motives for going. This was never about her.", "YTA\n\nFrom the perspective of someone who doesn't like surprises either:\n\n>I walk up behind her, grab her shoulder and say \u201cDoesn\u2019t my love look stunning in her gown?!\u201d\n\n**cringe**\n\nI hate being grabbed/touched when I'm not expecting it.

If you are her BF, you should have known this.\n\n>I go on to explain that I did it because I wanted to show my support and then lengths I\u2019ll always go through for her. \n\nSo this was about what you wanted to show her, not about what she wanted. You made her day about you.\n\n>She doesn\u2019t express any gratitude, nor appreciation.\n\nWhy would she be grateful that you made her day about you?", "Yta!  I hate surprises. She probably had reservations for lunch/dinner with her family, and you show up, now all her plans are screwed up, the time she wanted to spend with her family, she now has to figure out how to add you in\u2026 like someone else said, you made a day about her, all about you.", "Sorry, but YTA. You can't surprise people and feel entitled to a certain reaction. I'll agree her response was hurtful to you, but it's her response to have.", "If she wanted you at the graduation she would have gotten you a ticket.\n\nYou sound creepy and controlling. And for sure she is breaking up with you.\n\nYTA", "Soft YTA. I get that you went to the graduation with the best of intentions. And being a romantic at heart I would have liked to have heard that your gf gave a cry of joy at seeing you and threw her arms around you. But that didn't happen. Because as she said she doesn't like surprises. I've found that with the exception of an occasional surprise birthday party surprises seldom work out as the surpriser hoped.  Many people just don't like having things--including people they care about--just suddenly pop up in front of them. It can be extremely unsettling. If you value the relationship I'd accept that she doesn't like surprises, even in the form of you, and that you owe her an apology for it. Then get on with doing well planned things with her.", "Your plan- your intentional plan- was to secretly attend her graduation. You discussed attending and ended up not buying a ticket.\nYou attending isn\u2019t some heroic grand gesture. She was more than happy for you not to attend.\n\nYTA", "YTA. She *told* you that this ceremony wasn't really important to her and she was doing it just for her family. So your huge effort to attend and wanting her to be appreciative and grateful is really all for YOU and not for her. Why should she be grateful that you put such a huge effort into something she didn't want you to attend and didn't even want to attend herself?", "YTA\n\nYou showed up unexpectedly, and startled her.  \n\nYou should know whether or not she likes surprises.  And have planned accordingly.\n\nAnd if you aren't 100% sure that she likes surprises, you need to start with something small.  \n\nNot showing up uninvited at her graduation, when you know she already has scheduled plans with her family.  The way it worked out, if they have reservations for dinner after, or anything else, no one has had a chance to work you into the plans.  She knows you're there, and there is little point, because she won't be able to spend time with you or include you in the day's planned activities.\n\nDid you arrange a hotel for yourself, or did you assume you'd stay with her? Was  her family planning on staying at her place, as well?  \n\nThere are times and places for surprises.  In the middle of an already scheduled activity that involves multiple other people is not such a setting.\n\nPlanning a surprise takes away her chance to plan and organize an event involving herself and four other people.  If she'd had no one else attending, it might have been different.", "NTA\n\nYou genuinely did not mean to upset her. Also, considering this is a long distance relationship, and as far as I can tell from the story, there was no indication that she told you that she didn't like surprises. I'm giving her a soft AH because she should have told you that she didn't like surprises.", "NTA\nWTF is up with your gf? I can get maybe it was a shock and maybe she doesn't like surprises but thus was super thoughtful and sweet. My bf did something similar to this for me and I just hugged him. You may need to rethink this relationship. Her reaction sounds a little suspicious to me", "Obviously NTA. Don\u2019t really see how you thought you could be. This may be a jump to a conclusion but anytime a gf is not happy to see you when you show up somewhere when they expect you to be away, there is almost always another man in the picture and that man is usually in that same room or expected to be. Whether that\u2019s the case or not, she certainly doesn\u2019t respect you. I think you need to have an honest sit down with yourself and evaluate your relationship with her and see if it\u2019s worth continuing because you\u2019re clearly being taken for granted.", "NTA. She probably has a life at university that doesn't include you and is worried that your presence either spoils it or you discover what she's up to.\n\nIt sounds like she's checked out of the relationship so I'd be prepared to move on and find someone more deserving.", "Im with you on this one. NTA\n\nHate surprise or not , You showed her how much you truly do care for her. To me that should have overshadowed any feelings of I hate surprises\u2026 I wonder if there is more going on here on her end of things\u2026 not wanting your loved one share a great achievement is worrisome to me\u2026\n\nI have to question the relationship since you live in different states, albeit they are right next to each other but it seems something is awry on her end..", "ESH. Though your intentions were good, this isn't something to surprise her with if she doesn't like surprises. I mean, yeah, it's easy to assume your loved one wants you there. But it's still a big and maybe stressful event and I think you shouldn't have surprised her just before the ceremony. \n\nBut I feel it's weird that she didn't want you there in the first place. \n\nHave you two discussed you not being able to attend  beforehand? Did she express any sadness/disappointness that you didn't have a ticket?", "NTA. Are you sure she knows y\u2019all are together? It doesn\u2019t sound like it.", "NTA. But she is! I can't think of a single reason she should be annoyed unless she's hiding something or someone. Have you talked to her since?", "This is a hard one, I think you're NTA but it may have been a good idea to reach out to her family in advance so they at least knew you were coming, as to not steal time away from them. I do think it's very sweet of you to attend, but I understand where she is coming from! Maybe a NAH is best?", "nta, she just showed you she doesnt want you", "ESH. When I was young, one cardinal rule my brother told me was to never surprise a long distance girlfriend, unless you want your own surprise.", "YTA surprises suck. Had you coordinated with her, she likely would have been more grateful, even if to tell you that she wanted this personal time with her family.", "Is this what people mean when they say \u201cthey don\u2019t like surprises?\u201d \n\nI thought it was like\u2026surprise parties or trips. OPs partner is going into social work, people aren\u2019t always going to act a certain way, would that also be a surprise? \n\nNTA", "YTA.\n\nShe doesn't like surprises and you showed up uninvited. Why would she be grateful that you put yourself that far ahead of her?", "NTA. You deserve someone who will appreciate your efforts.", "Find someone that supports you and enjoys your presence and wants you to be there for them.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you deserve better honestly she doesn't seem like the grateful type.", "Hmm...I would have either gotten there early and shown your face or waited until it was over, hugs for family, photos, and then shown your face. \n\nAlso, 6.5+1.5=8. What graduation ceremony starts at 8AM?", "ESH, though well intentioned. When you expressed a desire to attend, she did not agree or encourage you in any way. In fact, she said she did not want to ask the school for another ticket. That should have told you everything you needed to know. Pay attention! She should have been clearer about her feelings.", "ESH\n\nI don\u2019t think your relationship is in dire straits but I do think that it\u2019s important to note that she wasn\u2019t even intending to walk, and then changed her mind because of her grandparents. It sounds as if she just wanted to celebrate with her family, which she should have clearly communicated.\n\nWell-intentioned or not, I don\u2019t think it was a good idea to show up uninvited. Probably would have been best to stick to your staying out of sight plan rather than approaching her during everything.", "NTA not sure what her reaction is about\u2026 but your intentions were to be a nice surprise for her. It may be that she genuinely can\u2019t handle changes, which imo would make me reconsider my choice of gf. Not very fun not flexible. I\u2019d be disappointed with her reaction too. Maybe further conversation is needed?", "NTA. I think it\u2019s time you call it quits. She clearly doesn\u2019t value you. If she did, she would be happy you made it to her graduation. In fact it seems like she views you as a pest. Harsh, I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019ve got to leave and find someone who wants you there to celebrate their milestones.", "NTA. You need to talk to her about why she didn't want you there. Sounds like your typical 'almost got caught out' situation.", "NTA - you did want any BF would do. The only strange thing was her reaction. I hate surprises, but would still welcome my significant other being there for this moment. Like another commenter said - be prepared for an imminent break up, or initiate yourself. But there is more to this story, that you don\u2019t know about.", "NTA. She wasn't happy because she doesn't like you. It's never pleasant to be surprised by someone you don't want around.\n\nSorry, but the whole \"I surprised my SO that I haven't seen in forever and they weren't happy I was there\" is like a breakup trope.", "I could see her not requesting an extra ticket for the ceremony, but she also didn\u2019t want you to plan on being in town for the after party to help her celebrate the milestone? My man\u2026if you\u2019re actually her boyfriend and don\u2019t just think you are, you\u2019ve got problems. She\u2019s an ex, she just hasn\u2019t told you yet. She either has another guy in college town, or she\u2019s accepted a post grad job far away from you and hasn\u2019t figured out how to tell you. My money is on the first one. NTA but y\u2019all need to talk, for realz.", "I\u2019m going to go with NAH. You had very good intentions, it is lovely that you care about your girlfriend enough to do all that. But hating surprises is legit, I am one of them because although it\u2019s a really nice surprise, I need to do mental adjustments which can be annoying and tiring. I bet with some time she will appreciate the gesture, but now you\u2019ve learned and know to not surprise her like that in the future.", "Oh man, I get the feeling she has a side piece in her class who she doesn't want you to meet.", "NTA.  Clearly she is not in pace with you.  Make sure she understands how this has hurt you.  Have that discussion and do not let this be the \u2019I hate surprises\u2019 discussion.", "NAH. It honestly sounds kinda frustrating to me to have an important day planned out, as I assume she was likely going out to eat or celebrate with her family after the ceremony, and now all of a sudden having another person (even a person I love) who has jumped in and I feel obligated to change everything to include them and work around their surprise. Especially if all of a sudden you\u2019re a surprise houseguest too. You meant well but your surprise probably felt like a bit of a burden too.", "You're absolutely NTA. Sorry to hear about her reaction.", "I don\u2019t think your asshole for wanting to surprise her but I am someone who absolutely hates surprises it gives me so much anxiety. My husband proposed out of the blue in front of all of his friends years ago I don\u2019t do well in large groups and again my anxiety is really triggered by big surprises. Needless to say it didn\u2019t go well obviously it\u2019s all good now. NTA for wanting to be there but also if you know her well and you know she doesn\u2019t like surprises you should have expected a less then stellar reaction.", "It\u2019s a soft ESH\n\nYou expressed your desire to attend. She did reciprocate with an invitation. She should\u2019ve communicated her reasons clearly, but I\u2019m assuming that she didn\u2019t think you would go to such lengths to attend. Still, she should\u2019ve told you why she wanted to keep it small. \n\nStill, we don\u2019t go places uninvited. Your girlfriend\u2019s refusal to issue an invite is a communication. You ignored this boundary and that\u2019s a problem. \n\nI hope you are able to receive an explanation and your heart heals quickly.", "You deserve better man. I would be extremely happy to have my boyfriend surprise me at a very big accomplishment. You put in lots of effort and you should have gotten appreciation.I hope she regrets her reaction", "Did she ever indicate that she would want you there if possible? It kind of seems like the possibility of you attending was never even discussed.", "NTA.  You can do better.  She doesn\u2019t love you.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she already has someone else.", "How long are you dating?\n\nI\u2018d go with NTA\nI also don\u2019t like surprises. But this was not a \u201ewill you marry me proposal in front of 1000 people\u201c, this was someone being there for a graduation ceremony. Normal reaction should be surprised, maybe speechless but ultimately happy. If you love the person.\n\nSo, you\u2019re either not dating for long or she\u2019s not that into you.", "Eh, I think YTA\n\nShe only walked for her grandparents. This tells me that the ceremony/fanfare isn't really her thing, AND that her grandparents are important to her. She probably really didn't want anyone else there\n\nAlso, you surprised her (in the most uncomfortable way possible) when you know she doesn't like surprises. And during an event she already doesn't want to attend, so there's a double whammy of discomfort and stress that you added.\n\nOften people go get food after a graduation. Now she has to wonder if you expected to tag along. Would whoever was paying feel obligated to now pay for you? Had you ever met her grandparents before? If not then it changes from low key dinner with family, to a stressful \"meet the family\" dinner when she already had a thing she didn't want to do but did for her grandparents, and a surprise guest when she doesn't like surprises. \n\nMy friend, what you needed to do was either take the hint that she didn't want you there, or use your big boy words to communicate with her, \"I would like to come see you graduate, would you please get me a ticket.\"", "Hey OP!  I would have loved for someone I actually cared about to be at my Master's ceremony. Instead, my family was there.  NTA", "YTA. You went behind her back and disrespected her. This wasn't about her. You made it all about you and your fragile ego. She didn't want you there so you had to make some stupid grand gesture and essentially prove her right. \n\nAlso, never ever ever go up behind someone like that as a way of introducing yourself, thinking it's cute and sneaky. It's not. It's creepy. You're a creep.", "NTA but it's pretty obvious she doesn't want you involved in her circles. i think you should've taken the hint when she implied she didn't want you there, didn't want to go through the 'effort' of asking for another ticket, and had a discussion about where you stand in each others lives. \n\nlong distance relationships won't work if the other person doesn't want to see you when you have opportunities to; without more context, it kinda implies she just wants an emotional relationship rather than a tangible one others can see. does her family know about you guys-- do her friends at college? also huge factors.", "It's weird she didn't want you to go. There was nothing wrong with you surprising her if you were in a happy relationship, most people would be happy to have their person there. But it's weird that you wanted to go and she didn't make an effort to get you there after you discussed it. This leads me to believe that she doesn't actually want to be in a relationship with you and has probably been thinking about ending things and just wants to deal with you as little as possible until she actually does it.\n\nNTA", "I'm so sorry ...NTA.", "YTA.  She doesn\u2019t like surprises, which you know, so you decided to surprise her to \u201cshow the lengths you will always go through for her\u201d?  \n\nYour attempt to show her what you\u2019ll do for her was you doing something she specifically doesn\u2019t like and didn\u2019t want you to do.  Why should she be happy and grateful that you ignored what she actually likes to do what you want?", "NTA - she acted like this cause she didn\u2019t want you to meet her other bf.", "YTA.  \"I walk up behind her, grab her shoulder and say \"Doesn't my love look stunning in her gown.\"  Uhm...yeah, my response would be the same.", "So she had 4 tickets to this event that even she didn't want to be at. She caves for her family and gets 4 tickets for her family. You then tell her several times you wish you could be there, too. She declines to ask the university for a ticket for you. She doesn't want you there.\n\nYou go behind her back and acquire a ticket to her event that she does not want you at, drive there, and show up at the event uninvited? YOU WERE NOT INVITED TO ATTEND.\n\nSo, sorry, showing up unannounced to an event you were deliberately not invited to does indeed make YTA.", "I\u2019m gonna ESH this. If you knew she hated surprises then this seems like a bad decision on your part. Her reaction seems a little over board as well given the effort you did put in.", "NTA I\u2019d be driving home single", "Info: Has she had serious conversations with you in the past regarding how she feels about being surprised? Did you have any idea that she may be unhappy about your surprise? I\u2019m definitely leaning towards you not being an AH, but I think if this is some serious issue which she has clearly communicated to you before, then maybe you could be the AH.", "Especially if she wasn\u2019t prepared to introduce OP to her family yet", "It was a heartfelt thing to do, right? The \"not liking surprises\" thing can be an issue, but damn, holding onto the \"this takes the cake\" thing?  I'm with you, I'm thinking a breakup is comoing.", "As someone who hates surprise visitors, parties, and activities that I was unprepared to engage in, I would absolutely be this pissed if someone I knew showed up somewhere I wasn't expecting them to be to surprise me after I had kind of made it clear I wasn't that interested in them being there. If she had wanted him there she would have asked her school about the extra ticket.  The OP should have taken the hint.  I'm not going to say that they were being an ahole or the like because their heart was theoretically in a good place but still he should have got the hint.  I know they don't say anything about trying to hang with their girlfriend on the trip but for me, If my plan, for example,  is that my parents and grandparents are going to be at a thing and I'm going to be hanging out with them, then it would be really irritating for my partner to show up and try and insert himself in that time without asking me.  I know a lot of people are jumping to cheating or just general drifting away, both are possible but it is actually possible that she's just pissed by what she took as an invasion of her plans. I stand by this especially because the OP didn't call her or anything to say \"Hey, guess what I'm coming there/here\" they just walked up  behind her and grabbed her which initially may have been panic inducing.  I'm going NAH without more information because I believe the OP had misplaced good intentions but until I have more information I think its possible that the girl who the OP already knew hated surprised just hated being surprised.", "She\u2019s really my girlfriend. Lol", "I asked the same question. It makes a massive difference if this is a long term or short term relationship", "No, it wasn't thoughtful. Surprises maybe fun, but they aren't thoughtful. I am firmly with Mr.Knightley on that.", "This was only thoughtful to OP.", "I am wondering if they are actually dating.", "It's exactly how someone would react if they weren't very into the other person.\n\nThe relationship was long over", "Plus I think it's weird he approached her while she was waiting to graduate. I've never been to a graduation or heard of that being acceptable at any ever. The section is for graduates and faculty only. You approach after the ceremony. Id be mad embarrassed if someone approached me like that. Unless this one was different for whatever reason", "That is the most cringe thing he could have said. I can\u2019t imagine dating a man who talks like that", ">You made her day about you.\n\n\nLooool\nWe will disagree on what \"making a day about you\" means here. She didn't graduate again or Op ruined her day by being there for her?", "Yeah, if she loved OP, this would have been a happy surprise. Sounds like she has a foot out the door.", ">To me that should have overshadowed any feelings of I hate surprises\u2026 I wonder if there is more going on here on her end of things\u2026 not wanting your loved one share a great achievement is worrisome to me\u2026\n\nIt is so frustrating when people day things like that. Like I genuinely cannot control the anxiety and discomfort that comes with surprises. So much so that mother told me my ex was planning to propose on my birthday when I thought it was going to just be our families meeting (we wouldn't have even been dating a year yet). Like me and ex couldn't work it out because he repeatedly would do stuff like this. It seems all cute and romantic to some but not to everyone.", "It's pretty obvious she didn't want him there. I mean, she didn't get a ticket for him, because she didn't want to ask? That's a weird thing to say, especially since apparently getting a ticket was very easy.", "I'm pretty sure mine started at 8", "No. This is not about how she did not communicate well enough. The OP decided to make the day about himself, and took away the graduation experience that she wanted. \n\nHow is it possibly up to her to think \u201cmaybe my boyfriend will secretly get an extra ticket and just show up? I need to communicate better!\u201d", ">I would absolutely be this pissed if someone I knew showed up somewhere I wasn't expecting them to be to surprise me after I had kind of made it clear I wasn't that interested in them being there\n\n\nHow did she make it clear? The tickets went to her family. I would have reasoned it like that.\n\nBut to see the love of my life at a milestone event and not appreciate them being there even after they told me the lengths they want and may anger is just \"I don't like surprises?\" Hell naw. Something is wrong. I would have been...confused...for a moment but angry? Bull", "He should have taken the hint and realized she just doesn\u2019t like him that much if she didn\u2019t want him there. Sorry buddy", "And op startle grabbed her from behind and then spewed that line?", "Could you be an adult and explicitly say \u201c I do not want you there.\u201c ? expecting them to the take a hint is cruel, especially if you suck at giving hints.", "I\u2019m sorry bro. That\u2019s sad she acted like that. NTA.", "Have you actually had a talk about your relatioship and how serious it is? You and this girl are dating, but  she didn't want to get you a ticket for her graduation, when it sounds as if it was very easy to do so. Do consider that maybe it's not as serious for her as it is for you? Have you ever met her family? If not, it's undertandable that she wouldn't have wanted to spring you on them. Also, surprises are almost never a great idea. If you don't know the person well, it's almost always a very bad idea. You could have saved both of you a lot of grief if you had told her you were coming. Yes, yes, your little rom-com stunt wouldn't happen, but, if she had wanted you there, her joy wouldn't be less.", "Sorry man but it seems like you need a new girlfriend.", "Info does your girlfriend like surprises?", "I don't like surprises much but that was sweet if you don't listen to this comment some of these people are just sad wiry their own life", "Exactly!", "As someone who *hates* surprises I could be head over heels in love and would still hate this. Honestly of not formu nervous tick of laughing when feeling discomfort, a lot of people would have some seriously hurt feelings.", "Step down from your high horse mate", "Tbf we don\u2019t know tone, maybe it was made to seem like getting an \u201cextra ticket\u201d was quite the arduous task. \n\nAlthough after calling and getting a ticket easily, there\u2019s where my suspicion would have started lol", "I HATE my plans shifting. But in theory she was already planning to go out with her family. It\u2019s not changing anything, merely adding an additional person. At most the dynamic shifts slightly. But it\u2019s unusual to be so upset over something like that that it eclipses every other thing. And as for the argument it was made clear she didn\u2019t want him there because she didn\u2019t ask for another ticket. Most people I know would be far too anxious to ask for another ticket even if they wanted that person there very badly, so if it were me, that\u2019s how I would\u2019ve taken it", "Same. I'm surprised so many people are saying N T A...like, honestly, no matter how much I liked somebody, this kind of a \"surprise\" would be a deal breaker for me."]}
