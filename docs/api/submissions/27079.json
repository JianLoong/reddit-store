Jake is my brother\u2019s son. My brother and I aren\u2019t that close, we don\u2019t match well but still we try to not argue. Recently my niece had her birthday party and there was a pool. This pool was really big and around 8 feet in the deepest part. Jake, along with another nephew and two nieces (all teenagers) were playing around but sometimes they tend to play rough, so naturally their mother was telling them to stop or someone could get hurt. \n\nAt one moment my brother\u2019s wife was annoyed, told Jake and the kids to stop it, but minutes later he decided that it would be fun and a good idea to throw my husband into the pool. Elliot was thrown to the deepest part, he knows how to swim but was in shock. He wasn\u2019t expecting that, everyone thought it wasn\u2019t big deal until he couldn\u2019t make it out of the pool. \n\nMy other nephew and I got him out of the pool, he was disoriented but was mostly alright, besides the few bruises he got. I lost it and screamed at Jake, asked him if he was mentally compromised and told him that he was out of his mind. My brother eventually told me to cut it off, that everything was alright. I told my brother \u2018tell your son to get out of my way, I don\u2019t want to see him\u2019, but that was it\n\n Later at night my brother\u2019s wife came to apologize, but my father and a few members of my family think that we\u2019re making a big deal about it\u2026\n\n\n\nEdit, I understand that most people don\u2019t get hurt by jumping on a pool, but my husband had bruises because he got pushed very hard. He bruises easily anyway, so I wasn\u2019t surprised for that. He\u2019s also been having headaches to the point that he can barely sleep. Of course he can defend himself, he just doesn\u2019t want to.
