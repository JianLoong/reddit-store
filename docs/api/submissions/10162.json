He thinks this is a boundary I should be setting for myself, as my mom tends to overstep into my life alot. \n\nShe also told me I could just drop out, as one of my options which I've made clear I'm not dropping out. I've always struggled in school and have almost failed every year of highschool, barely pulling through by the end of the year due to mental health and lack of motivation. I've explained about my meds, how much they helped and how I plan to start again tomorrow but she won't hear any of it and has threatened to kick me out if I go out after school for non work related things. \n\nI've tried using planners, timers and alarms, organizing all my classes, I had my phone taken for a year and that didn't affect any of my grades and taking away my privileges has never made me want to pull my grades up.i don't wanna deal with the drama of not doing what she says, but I don't  be miserable for the next few months or more until I move out  Am I the asshole.\n\nEdit: I fought for 3 years for my mom to consider medication. She denied it at first and finally allowed it in may 2022. When they tried to up the dose she said she wanted me off the meds entirely even if they were helping as she doesn't believe I actually have manic depression.

You need serious help, and I think you should talk to a doctor about getting back on your meds.\n\nBeing grounded isn't the solution, but if you want to do whatever you want as an 18-year-old, you have to show some ownership in your own life. You're the only one who has to take the consequences of your actions. You can choose to learn that the hard way if you want.\n\nBut it seems like you definitely need to take ownership of your mental health.", "****I say that with some regret.\n\nIt is your mother\u2019s house.

Does he help you with school or is he part of the problem? You\u2019d don\u2019t live with him. Can he even support you if he wanted to?\n\nYes. You are an adult. At the same time, you live in your mom\u2019s house and she\u2019s concerned about you. \n\nAs an adult, it chafes to have someone tell you what to do. But adult life is doing a whole bunch of things you don\u2019t wanna do. \n\nMove out or do what she says. I vote for the latter.\n\nEdit. Due to OP\u2019s response I change my vote.", "YTA for quitting your meds without talking to your doctor and coming up with a plan to end them safely, especially when you know they help.", " Slight YTA-  No matter your age you're still living in her home and aren't contributing to the household. Your grades are poor haven't improved due to you not taking your meds which is your responsibility as your your grades. Either you move out early or you pull your grades up but don't disregard your mother's words because you're 18. \n\nYou say you're boyfriend helps but what is contributing besides telling you that your mom's being uncool here? Is he helping you with your homework and class work? Is he looking for a place for you to go since I doubt you'll graduate, at most you'll maybe get your GED since you've constantly been unmotivated to actually try your class work and that seems to be WITH your meds (considering there are 4 years of hs). Your mother may be onto something here if you're hanging with him instead of doing your schoolwork. \n\nYou can put yourself in therapy, maybe try a different medication but until you can move out you have to listen to your mother. You're 18, she doesn't owe you anything anymore, let alone a roof over your head so if you disregard her rules then prepare to be put out.", "I think you will feel better when you get to have some space from her.

You're still living in her house and she clearly still cares about you so she's trying to take steps she thinks might work.\n\nBeing 18 doesn't make you an actual adult until you start behaving like one. According to you you're effectively failing/getting zero credit for 66% of your classes. Clearly whatever you're currently doing, going out with your BF and doing after school activities,  is not working.\n\nYou know you're off your meds and your depression is bad. But instead of fixing it BY TAKING THE MEDS you say you're too depressed to fix the issue. Clearly you need someone else to help you run things right now until you get back on track. Why would you think this, or any of your other problems will improve by keeping things status quo? Accept the grounding as a chance to focus on getting your life back on track, take your meds, and try to get your grades back while you still can. Believe it or not lots of entry-level jobs will want to know what your high school GPA was, so it matters to an extent.", "Hey, I was like this at 18 until I got my ADHD diagnosis. Life is hard, help yourself. You deserve it.", "YTA. You're right that she can't legally stop you from doing what you want to do as an adult, but she also doesn't owe you a roof over your head anymore, so if you can't afford to move out and support yourself, it would behoove you to listen to her. She's trying to help you.\n\nYou mentioned your bf is the only one who takes your health seriously, but being an adult works both ways: if you truly want to help yourself out of this, you can pursue therapy without anyone else's input. It sounds like you're working and there are plenty of options out there for folks at nearly all income levels.", "YTA.\n\nWhether you are an adult or not, you live in your mother's home so yeah, she can set conditions on your living there. If you don't like her policies, move out. There are plenty of landlords who will accept the rent money you're offering her.\n\nI'm sorry for your issues and it sounds like your mom isn't really sympathetic to them, but part of being an adult is taking responsibility for yourself. You went off medications and YOU chose not to go back on them. YOU are getting poor grades. Your mom, perhaps not with the most understanding, has tried to help you focus on your studies and work. Maybe she hasn't used the best methods, but I don't see anything unreasonable here given what you've said.\n\nI hope you figure out a more sustainable way forward as you get ready to move out on your own and find something that motivates you.\n\nEDIT: based on new information, I'm changing my opinion to NTA.\n\nYes, OP, your mom can ground you. But it does sound like your mom has not adequately provided for your mental health as a minor (which is her responsibility) and has not always acted in your medical self interest. Major mental health issues and it sounds like TBI could also be major factors in your poor school performance. I hope as an adult (and living in a new situation) you're able to turn some of these things around. As most people here are saying, as an adult you'll need to take responsibility as for these tough things.", "I'm not going to call you an ass but you are kind of in the wrong here.", "YTA. You're living in her house, and you've not graduated highschool. Your age is irrelevant until you start ADEQUATELY CONTRIBUTING (ie, your equal share and all your personal bills).", "YTA\n\nUnless you are willing to be homeless, yes she can ground you.\n\nAs long as you live in her house, you have to abide by her rules.

Your results are pretty bad, you live under her roof and you\u2019re still in school. She can ground you.", "Unfortunately you're at her mercy until you move out. Try to hang in there and get your treatments. I imagine school is very hard in your condition. You could probably qualify as being disabled by the sound of it. No, grounding won't help. Your low grades aren't caused by lack of interest or focus if you have a severe medical issue.", "Lmao. YTA. You haven\u2019t even graduated yet, and it looks like that may not happen. Unless you\u2019re prepared to move out and get a job/or your GED, you\u2019d better listen to your mother.", "After reading your responses etc I\u2019m going NTA, purely because your mothers answer to your mental health issues is to ground you. She should be encouraging positive things around you, not locking you up. Ie - reminding you to take the medication that you believe is helping you. Supporting you any way she can to get your grades up\u2026 at any point does she sit with you and support you to do your homework? Or get you tutoring in subjects you\u2019re struggling with?? I\u2019m sorry OP that your mother seems resistant to supporting you. \n\nIn her home you do need to follow her rules, do I think grounding you is justified, hell no! But try and make the best of it. Ask for a tutor whilst you\u2019re grounded to support you to get your grades up!", "YTA. Possibly ESH if your mom actually offered that you drop out as a solution. Your obligation right now is to get an education. Set timers, whatever you have to do to remember your meds and get your grades up. Life isn't going to get easier, you have to find ways to be responsible.", "NTA Regardless of reasons, at 18 one can refuse to be grounded for any reason or none at all. It may get you evicted, so it might not be wise depending on circumstances but it is never morally wrong. Reading your comments where you reveal your mother has been contributing towards your mental problems in multiple ways is just the cherry on top. You do need to take better care regarding your medication though.", "NTA exactly but you're playing a dangerous game. You're an adult and your mom has no legal authority to ground you. The question is, do you want to force that issue? She DOES have the legal authority to evict you. Don't make it something where she feels like that's the only option. Work things out. Put up with the rules. Honestly, you don't sound ready to be on your own.", "Forget about house rules. I think you have ADD of some kind because what I am reading is something I could have written when I was in school myself.\n\nMy saving grace was that I was a voracious reader, so at the beginning of the school year I read all the textbooks cover to cover. That helped me later when I would misplace assignments, studied philosophy when I had a history test, forgot test days, misplaced papers where I had written notes. \n\nWhen I think back on those days, I get physically sick. At the time ADD wasn't even a thing. I had to suffer in silence and I was classified as \"bright but he doesn't apply himself\". \n\nEventually, I discovered little tricks that helped me keep track of things. I became very proficient in IT because working with a computer gave me the structure my mind needed to accomplish things.\n\nLikewise I did very well in the military because because of the rigid discipline.\n\nI don't know what meds you are not taking or what your mental issues are, but I want you to know that:\n\n* It's not your fault.\n* You (likely) are not stupid.\n* You need professional help.\n* Ultimately, it's up to you to take yourself out of this vicious circle.\n* This is something that will stay with you for the rest of your life, but it can be overcome.\n* I know your BF seems important right now, but trust me, he is not. Your education is far more important and finding a way to overcome your current limitations is more important than anything else.\n\nI am sorry you have to go through this. My daughter also did and she had a very hard time in school. She is now defending her PhD, but it has been over a year writing her thesis precisely because of this issue.\n\nI have often explained as follows: I am very good at folding clothes after the wash. However, after doing a bang up job folding and I am left with a camisole (my wife's), 2 pairs of underwear and 3 mismatched socks, I would much rather set them on fire than having to deal with them. I am mentally incapable of finishing the folding job.\n\nSounds familiar?", "Here\u2019s the thing, I hear you about the frustration and it does seem like there\u2019s a lot of issues with your relationship with your mom. However, there\u2019s a a few things here where I think you may be in the wrong. I do think that your mom has your best interests at heart and is doing what she thinks is what you need. The only reason these things didn\u2019t work in the past is because what your mom doesn\u2019t understand is the change has to come from within you. She is removing what she assumes are the barriers to this problem. \n\nWith the medicine and the feeling like a failure and then having familial problems compounding on this- I\u2019ve 100% been in that exact situation. There comes a point in depression where getting better takes a lot of work and is actually more difficult than staying depressed. Sometimes it\u2019s easier just to stay in the pattern youre in because it\u2019s familiar and it\u2019s easier to sink into the hole than to try and climb out. You need to fight this, but you can start small. The medication is the first thing, just because you forget your doses doesn\u2019t mean you need to stop all together. It\u2019s okay, missing your doses isn\u2019t ideal but it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re figuring things out. Take them when you remember, leave them in your pockets, in your school bag for when you forget. Find a med like Prozac that is more forgiving when you miss a dose. If you need medicine, you need to cover that base and make sure you have it.\n\nYour moms bothering you over grades and attendance because she loves you and wants you to succeed. I would try and have a conversation about how you both want the same things. I would explain to her what you\u2019re doing already to do this and show her that you have time set aside for school work and time set aside for resting that way you can continue to work hard at school instead of becoming overworked and fatigued. \n\nLastly, this might sound dumb, but I\u2019d ask your mom to do something with you once a week. Go out for walks, go get coffee or ice cream. Try and become more comfortable communicating together. \n\n\nAfter all of that, if it still doesn\u2019t work out, do what you need to do. But make sure you find some form of therapy. I hope things get better for you and I hope that you can work past these issues you\u2019ve been having.\n\nEDIT with judgement: NAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s great he is such a good support to you, and it sounds as though he\u2019s really taken on a \u201cfather figure\u201d role in your world. \n\nDo you know why your mother is anti you getting help with your mental health? Has she been done wrong by doctors before? Is she worried she will be to blame for your issues?? Could be a million different things. But it sounds as though you\u2019re in a pretty vulnerable spot!", "So you wouldn't be able to live alone then if you can't properly function.", "She was on it herself to quit smoking (Wellbutrin, 100mg time release pill) and they wanted to up it to 150, but since she had a bad experience wehn she was using it to quit smoking she didn't want me to use it for my manic depression. I'm now on ambilify 2mg which has helped better but I think it still needs upped. She never did, none of my family believes I have manic depression, and they don't think I should be on my meds. I get judged for it any time I bring it up.", "I do think they could be but have had ct and MRI done which they said there shouldn't be any major problems, just some memory problems and headaches. I had a severe concussion in which I don't remember the events of but I know I was biking with my dog, and then I was in the hospital.", "Right meaning I've regonized I've been depressed the past couple weeks and I'm now realizing I haven't been taking my meds consistently. That happens, people forget.", "Yes, and I am putting more precautions in place so I do not miss them anymore now", "Mine said as long as I bring it up. My symptoms are not entirely debilitating. I lived with them for at least 3 years before I was medicated. It's not a huge difference for me", "She doesn't believe I am mentally ill. She had her own issues to work through with mental illness and she won't, doesn't believe in any of it. He is 20 and I am 18 but it's only a year and a half gap based on the months. He's been with me since end of freshman year and is really great to me, and kinda he has. He is very similar to my dad but we met before my dad passed away, and has been here for me more then anyone else including my mom since", "I don't plan to, I'm gonna live with my bf. We have no plans of breaking up and I know what people say, we're young it could happen, whatever. If it does it does and I will have actually lived \"on my own\" for a while with someone to help me out here and there when I forget something. I plan to get medical care for the stuff said and go back on my meds .", "I'm really sorry OP. I hope you can get the care you need going forward.", "Ok so as a legal adult you could get your own health insurance and make your own doc appointments. She has no power over you other than bitching at this point. She\u2019s not mentally healthy so doesn\u2019t even really know what that means or have any clue why being supportive is so important\u2014 not an excuse for her at all but likely facts that you are better informed than she is about mental health in general. Once you get to college too make sure to use the counseling center on campus a lot of what those counselors deal with is young adults who just got away from toxic environments (their families).", "I have a friend who professionally is in the business of concussion recovery, and what you experienced is definitely severe.\n\nAs an adult I would encourage you to continue to seek out care, headaches and memory problems sound like symptoms of a brain that is not fully healed yet.", "People all have different opinions and experiences with medications but when I say all that matters is you and your health & I truly mean that!!", "Could you maybe have your boyfriend remind you?", "It sounds like he\u2019s an incredibly supportive guy! I am sorry you\u2019re in that situation with your mom, and the loss of your father also! I hope you find a space where you can begin to thrive! Sometimes it takes big change, sometimes it just takes a change of mindset.", "I don't plan to go to college at all. And I don't particularly like talk therapy. I'm extremely nervous and I don't like talking to people about my problems face to face, which is why I'm posting here tbh. I have been to therapy 2 times before but I was told \" you don't give a healthy kid medicine right?\" By my dad, and I went to grief coulsing when he passed away and all I did was talk about my current life, nothing about my grief or the deaths that had happened. They tried to  forced me to make a police report at 17 for when I was SA by her ex bfs kid at 9 yrs old. They told me mom I was having paranoia about this kid finding me and she freaked out yelling at me for telling the therapist that.", "Ugh ok so your family life has been seriously f\u2019ed up and imo your mental health likely won\u2019t get better while mom is actively in your life. health care especially mental health care is a bitch. If you are in the US healthcare is a business which sucks for all the reasons except 1: you are the customer you choose how to use the service you pay for. If you don\u2019t feel a vibe with a therapist, dump them and make an appointment with a different one. Same with what you tell them, tell them your medical symptoms and how they effect your daily life so that they can help with medication or coping strategies but if you don\u2019t want to talk about family or your childhood or whatever you are not in anyway obligated to. Sign up for state medical coverage you\u2019ll likely qualify and do it on your terms you make the rules no one else, not mom or doc. It\u2019s not easy o won\u2019t lie I still struggle making and keeping appointments but being able to get through every day just a little bit easier makes it worth it. There are also TONS of different meds so if one isn\u2019t great tell the doc you want to try something else (if they push back, which a good one won\u2019t, you repeat your request and advise you\u2019ll seek another provider if they aren\u2019t able to meet your needs). Sorry this is a lot I\u2019ve fought with the US mental health care system for myself and my partner intensely and this is what I\u2019ve learned.", "But yes I do plan to continue the meds and do possibly therapy but not sure on that. My bf is the biggest help and basically is my therapist. I've told him alot I feel like my mental health is a burden and every time he tells me that if I'm not feeling 100% I need to tell him no matter what. My mom does almost nothing for me besides pay for the house. She doesn't even do her own dishes, clean out the fridge, sweep mom or vacuum unless her bf is coming over. I'm expected to clean up everything, go to school and go to work.", "I am in the us, I will be doing this soon.", "Not to be weird but if you need any advice along the way I\u2019ll help if I can! I work at a university so helping folks your age with shit their parents never taught them is something I do every day. I\u2019m not a professional in this field but I have way too much experience lol I have faith in you", "Thank you!", "NTA. You're an adult at 18, her rules simply don't apply after that. Just ignore her. Move out if you must. But make it clear that you won't tolerate being treated like a child. That's over.", "You say you plan to move out when you graduate, but you may not graduate with your current grades.", "Look I\u2019m going to say NTA only because I suffered a brain injury as a kid and it changes you. It sucks.", "Please get into talk therapy again. It can take a couple of tries to find the right therapist, just like it can for meds. Now that you're 18, it's all up to you. Please get yourself healthy. It's work, but it's possible. Speaking as someone who came from a very messed up household and is now working in MH.", "NTA.  This is a bit of a mess. You're legally right that she can't ground you. She's also legally right that she's no longer obligated to give you housing free or otherwise. It sounds like she's abusive, neglectful at the least, and honestly you should probably consider moving out if you have somewhere else to go.  That said, it also sounds like you need to get back on your meds ASAP.  I've gone off my meds because I was too depressed to take them before, it never worked well", "Go back on your meds and get an ADHD assessment.\n\nNTA.", "> You're 18, she doesn't owe you anything anymore, let alone a roof over your head so if you disregard her rules then prepare to be put out.\n\nAnd mom can prepare to not have a relationship with her kid and enjoy being alone in old age. Also, since mom is and adult then daughter doesn't owe her anything either.", "Jesus how callus can you be? She just turned 18 and hasn\u2019t even graduated high school yet. On top of that she has been dealing with mental health problems and her mother\u2019s reaction is to just say toughen up? She didn\u2019t get OP help until she was 17, less than a year ago. \n\nJust because you turn 18 doesn\u2019t magically cure you of all of your mental health problems. And depending on where OP lives, yes her mother may have the ***legal*** right to kick her out, but this sub isn\u2019t about is this legal, it\u2019s am I the AH. \n\nI just keep getting shock by man\u2019s inhumanity towards man every time and I really should be over it by now.", "Can you move in with your boyfriend?  He sounds more supportive than  your mother.", "IDK, from this response it sounds like her mom is saying she won\u2019t take her money so she can control part of her life because she isn\u2019t paying any type of rent", "I completely get where you're coming from with this. I have autism, manic depression, ptsd, anxiety and ocd. I know my meds help me keep on track and only just recently (7 months or so) I was FINALLY able to remember them every morning. \n\nI have also tried reminders, sticky notes, marking my calendar after taking them with a red pen. Pill boxes, my mom even monitoring them. \n\nI didn't particularly do anything to finally be able to remember on my own. I woke up and it was just easy. I think in my case it's also helped to become my routine in the morning. First thing I do is make a cup of coffee and take my meds with it.\n\nI'm 23 btw, have been on/off medication for YEARS because of it just not sticking to my mind", "It is up to you to do this for yourself, esp if you intend to be independent. Set alarms on your phone as reminders or find other ways to do it. And for heavens sake, get it straight what your diagnosis actually is. Been there, done that.", "Hey, I relate to this! I use an app to remind me to take mine and have it ping me multiple times a day. I personally use Finch, but I also have a migraine app that does a backup alert too in case Finch's fail.\n\nWould this help you perhaps?", "Take em either right when you get up or right when you go to bed, mid-day meds are difficult to remember because people are often doing something different so your brain doesn't cement taking them as a routine. It says abilify can keep you awake so my suggestion would be each night once you're done with your phone, put the pill bottle on top of it so when you wake up you have to physically hold them (and therefore have a higher chance of taking them) to continue your day, and keep a glass of water/bottle next to you so you don't have to get up and have a chance to be distracted. I have ADHD and can't use alarms due to a sleep disorder and I found that touch/taste is critical to remembering things like this since brains tune out visuals pretty easily.", "That's not how that works.\nQuiting cold turkey is incredibly dangerous because it can cause reactions way stronger than the condition the pills treat.\nIt does not matter if your mental health symptoms are not debilitating NO DOCTOR would ever say it's fine to quit and start your meds whenever you feel like it.", "From the way you describe your situation, your symptoms HAVE been debilitating.", "Bring it up means 'tell me so I can safely wean you off them'.  It doesn't mean just quit.  These are real, dangerous substances when you do not respect what they can do to you.  YTA, but not for the thing you don't like.  Move out if that's your problem but if you treat medication like it's optional there  are consequences."]}
