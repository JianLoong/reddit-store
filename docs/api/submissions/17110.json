They aren't entitled to it, but family helps each other out and unless they were incredibly shitty and abusive it's pretty selfish to NEVER be willing to help out your parents financially\n\nNot saying op should in this particular case but there are definitely circumstances in which it's valid to ask for help. My parents have bailed me out with money when i was broke and I've gladly return the favor when i was doing well and they were struggling", "This. NTA", "This response needs more upvotes. If the money were for an operation that fixes all things, it\u2019d be an interesting moral dilemma. But asking OP to yield her savings for *running costs*? What\u2019s their long term plan? Winning the lottery?\n\nAs a parent of a disabled child you see this once in a while in the community. \u201c*We got the best care for little Bobbie, but after we sold our house and burned through our 401k we can no longer pay for it, woe be me*\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s unfortunate but also irresponsible financial planning?\n\nIt\u2019s very heroic to get the best care possible without regards for the future. It\u2019s shortsighted to do that without the ability to fund it. It\u2019s uncalled for to put the onus on family members who can\u2019t pay for it either and expect them to sacrifice *their* savings for *your* hopeless cause.", "Yesterday I had no money at all.

Someone made a factually inaccurate statement. Spoiler: It was you", "Tell me you've never experienced poverty without telling me you've never experienced poverty.", "Hahahaha what utter horse shit. I grew up incredibly poor, you chose to be sanctimonious and I chose to reflect your awful tone. Bad isn't it?", "Fair enough. \n\nI apologize if you read my comment as sanctimonious and awful. It wasn't intended as such. I read the original comment and I thought \"Hey! Wait a minute! I am *too* a person! I'm not nobody!\" And I felt like speaking up to affirm the fact that I am, a human being, and I do, exist. \n\nToo often when you're poor you're either treated like you're invisible, or you're actively looked down on and dehumanized.\n\nI have no money right now. At all. Not to hand, not in the ether. I'm not nobody.", "I apologise as well. God the Internet makes toxic people of us all. I hope you are doing as ok as you can in the circumstances and I've answered my own AITA without posting one! Honestly, have a wonderful day and you certainly aren't nobody.
