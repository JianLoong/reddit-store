I\u2019m looking at the long term picture here and it doesn\u2019t look good.\n\nI grew up with a special needs brother and I have several cousins with special needs on my mom\u2019s side of the family (genetic issue).  There are four families affected. Three of us have had to deal with being told by our parents that the special needs sibling is going to be our responsibility when our parents die. All of these siblings are 40+ in age and live with our parents.  All of our siblings should have been transitioned into group homes years ago.  It was our parents\u2019 choice to keep them at home (there\u2019s a real \u201cmartyr complex\u201d at play here, although I never doubt my aunts and my mother\u2019s love for their kids).\n\nPlease trust me when I tell you that you need to be EXPLICITLY clear IN WRITING that you are refusing responsibility, because if your parents decide to make a will and name you as guardian without your consent, it will take you a very long time to extricate yourself from the responsibility.  The state will initially place your sister with you while you sort it out if their will specified you would become guardian. Spots in group homes don\u2019t grow on trees.  Waiting lists can be a couple of years long. \n\nIt will be emotionally devastating for your sister to deal with losing a parent and an unstable living situation simultaneously.  She will feel abandoned on all fronts.  Don\u2019t equate low IQ with an inability to feel.  My brother (now deceased, so that particular issue no longer exists for me) had an IQ of 25, but he knew what rejection and abandonment was, even if he couldn\u2019t articulate it because he was barely verbal.  It\u2019s heart-wrenching\u2014and it\u2019s still not your responsibility.  It is your parents\u2019 responsibility to place her in a group home setting while they are still alive to help her transition.  Ideally, this will be when she turns 18.\n\nIn the meantime, because there may be a hornet\u2019s nest later, you absolutely cannot start a pattern of helping them out financially.  You don\u2019t want to establish that kind of paper trail or pattern.  It would be okay to hang out with her while you give the parents a break for a few hours, but avoid too many overnighters.  It needs to be occasional and infrequent over a period of years.\n\nEnd of the story on my end:  Before my brother died in 2018, my husband and I tried to convince my mom (at the urging of experts) to start transitioning my brother into a group home so he could make huge emotional transitions in stages and she told us, smirking, SMIRKING(!), that she had decided to just let it be our problem once she was dead.  She didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass that it would mean that one of us would have to give up our job and how that would impact us financially. She pulled some other unrelated crap in 2021 and 2022 and I\u2019m now NC with her.  One of my cousins went NC with my aunt for two years over this issue a few years back. I have no idea what they decided to do since I don\u2019t get family news from my mom any longer. My third cousin is resigned to the fact that her sister will be living with her when that aunt passes.\n\nYou have to be very proactive now to save yourself headaches and unnecessary trauma to your sister later.  NTA", "NTA OP keep your money and protect it with security (passwords, credit locks, etc.).\n\nYour parents should have already started claiming disability payments for your sister through Social Security. If they haven't, they need to pronto. This would help with taking care of her for the rest of her life. Also, they should have her on Medicaid through her state as they will actually pay some towards a caregiver (including stepmom). They don't pay for all of it, but it would help.\n\nThere are governmental means available to parents of disabled children. They should have started looking into this when she was very young. If they are receiving those benefits, then they should be able to get some assistance for her maintenance. Sounds to me as if they haven't done anything towards getting benefits.\n\nThis is not your problem to solve. She is their child so she's their problem. As for the relatives calling you? Block them. The money your mom saved for you absolutely does not belong to them or the sister plus, it will probably not even put a dent in their financial problems.
