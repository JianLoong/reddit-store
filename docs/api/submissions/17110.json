All of these siblings are 40+ in age and live with our parents.  All of our siblings should have been transitioned into group homes years ago.  It was our parents\u2019 choice to keep them at home (there\u2019s a real \u201cmartyr complex\u201d at play here, although I never doubt my aunts and my mother\u2019s love for their kids).\n\nPlease trust me when I tell you that you need to be EXPLICITLY clear IN WRITING that you are refusing responsibility, because if your parents decide to make a will and name you as guardian without your consent, it will take you a very long time to extricate yourself from the responsibility.  The state will initially place your sister with you while you sort it out if their will specified you would become guardian. Spots in group homes don\u2019t grow on trees.  Waiting lists can be a couple of years long. \n\nIt will be emotionally devastating for your sister to deal with losing a parent and an unstable living situation simultaneously.  She will feel abandoned on all fronts.  Don\u2019t equate low IQ with an inability to feel.  My brother (now deceased, so that particular issue no longer exists for me) had an IQ of 25, but he knew what rejection and abandonment was, even if he couldn\u2019t articulate it because he was barely verbal.  It\u2019s heart-wrenching\u2014and it\u2019s still not your responsibility.  It is your parents\u2019 responsibility to place her in a group home setting while they are still alive to help her transition.  Ideally, this will be when she turns 18.\n\nIn the meantime, because there may be a hornet\u2019s nest later, you absolutely cannot start a pattern of helping them out financially.  You don\u2019t want to establish that kind of paper trail or pattern.  It would be okay to hang out with her while you give the parents a break for a few hours, but avoid too many overnighters.  It needs to be occasional and infrequent over a period of years.\n\nEnd of the story on my end:  Before my brother died in 2018, my husband and I tried to convince my mom (at the urging of experts) to start transitioning my brother into a group home so he could make huge emotional transitions in stages and she told us, smirking, SMIRKING(!), that she had decided to just let it be our problem once she was dead.  She didn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass that it would mean that one of us would have to give up our job and how that would impact us financially. She pulled some other unrelated crap in 2021 and 2022 and I\u2019m now NC with her.  One of my cousins went NC with my aunt for two years over this issue a few years back. I have no idea what they decided to do since I don\u2019t get family news from my mom any longer. My third cousin is resigned to the fact that her sister will be living with her when that aunt passes.\n\nYou have to be very proactive now to save yourself headaches and unnecessary trauma to your sister later.  NTA", "NTA OP keep your money and protect it with security (passwords, credit locks, etc.).\n\nYour parents should have already started claiming disability payments for your sister through Social Security. If they haven't, they need to pronto. This would help with taking care of her for the rest of her life. Also, they should have her on Medicaid through her state as they will actually pay some towards a caregiver (including stepmom). They don't pay for all of it, but it would help.\n\nThere are governmental means available to parents of disabled children. They should have started looking into this when she was very young. If they are receiving those benefits, then they should be able to get some assistance for her maintenance. Sounds to me as if they haven't done anything towards getting benefits.\n\nThis is not your problem to solve. She is their child so she's their problem. As for the relatives calling you? Block them. The money your mom saved for you absolutely does not belong to them or the sister plus, it will probably not even put a dent in their financial problems. Not to mention that I bet your mom would be absolutely pissed if you gave it to them. You could very well lose any support from her in the future.", "NTA. While you don't need the money right this minute, someday you may have your own special needs, want to buy a house, a big wedding, or put towards retirement. You shouldn't have to give up those things because your dad's wife misses going to work. Because she would rather pay someone else than care for her own child. I get that special needs kids are a lit of work, but that's the risk you have to acknowledge when you have a kid.\n\nJust stop entertaining this conversation. Block any of Josie's family that contact you about this. Shoot the flying monkeys out of the sky.", "NTA, they chose to bring a child into the world.", "NTA. The mom can and apparently is willing to go back to work. Have her use her work money to pay for the daughter\u2019s care cost.", "Absolutely NTA. Not to sound hateful but where TF does your stepmom and her fmsily get off telling you where to utilize YOUR college fund and future when you\u2019re still a young person yourself. They should have been more responsible and planned ahead when having that level of special needs child.", "Oh NTA.\n\nI am a mum with an unexpected, special medical, social and physical special needs child.  I no longer can work due to her care needs.  Do I miss my job and working? OH HELL YES\n\nBut here is the thing.  When you fall pregnant and have a child you agree to support them in sickness and in health.  Most people are lucky to never even consider the sickness bit but it is definitely there in the small print.  Hell no one knows tomorrow.  Tomorrow you could be in an accident, become disabled yourself and need your own money to support your needs.\n\nI would NEVER put my own needs in front of my child and will love them forever, whoever they are, whatever they become.  As long as they are safe and fulfilled, that is enough for me.", "NTA\n\nWhen you choose to have a child, you have to accept responsibility for that child regardless of having special needs or not. Your father and stepmother chose to have a baby, not you. If they're worried so much about their daughters care then maybe they should seek benefits or additional benefits from Social Security. Otherwise this is not your problem. Also reiterating what a few smart people have added to this, but lock down your social media number, credit and banking information. You never know what could happen.", "NTA.\n\nThey want to penalize your capability and thrift.\n\nThey're also trying to penalize you for refusing to be a brood mare for their twisted social desires.\n\nTell them to get 2nd / 3rd jobs to pay for Melody.  Your dad divorced (or WAS divorced) your mom and isn't entitled to a PENNY of that money.", " NTA, why aren\u2019t they getting assistance for her care through the state?", "NTA, why tf would they expect you to be responsible for **their** child? Amazing.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t bring her in this works, she isn\u2019t your responsibility.", "NTA. You are not responsible for the step-sister\u2019s care, OP. Don\u2019t let them guilt you into taking that on, not physically, not financially. They are the parents, it\u2019s their responsibility. You keep doing what you\u2019re doing, taking care of yourself and planning for your future. Go NC if necessary, but don\u2019t let them take advantage of you. NTA.", "NTA. Do some research and help them find a nonprofit or a organization or government support. This shouldn\u2019t even be an issue. Poor Josie. And I\u2019m sorry you were put in that position", "OP, go to the bank and tell them you're worried about theft from family members and ask for elevated account security.  All the normal bank security questions are well known to family members.\n\nIf they wouldn't do this, then no harm, no foul.  If they would (and well, they're the type looking to suck every penny they can from anyone they can...)", "\"It takes a village to raise a child\"   ?", "This! Your mom saved that money for you it\u2019s ridiculous your dad and his wife even asked for the money your mother saved for you and your future . They asked, you said no that should be the end of it. To get Josie\u2019s family to get involved ridiculous! Well the can put their money together and help out. Josie\u2019s family should not be harassing you. I like the group chat idea below. NTA.", "This a million x\u2019s.  Why do people always expect someone else to do what they\u2019re not willing to do?", "Agreed! I have spoken", "Yeah, drive the point home. \"What makes you think I'd believe you *could* help me? You don't have the time or money to take care of *that* kid, much less any leftover or extra for your other kid.\"", "Don\u2019t think they would be there for you when you need help anyway.  That\u2019s not the way those things work. You haven\u2019t lost anything by taking care if yourself.  If they won\u2019t take care of the child they created together, why would they ever take care of you.", "Exactly.  Their short term fix to their long term problem doesn\u2019t elevate them out of their situation.\n It only removes the OP\u2019s own safety net.  Also, OP giving the money her mother saved to her ex seems wrong too.", "Given the OP has a college fund, she likely lives in the US.", "No, she shouldn't. When did I say that? \n\n\nWhat a ridiculous exaggeration. She could do something, more than nothing. I didn't say she she needed to make a lifetime time commitment or make herself destitute. Jeeze.", "Yup. They're all you should give them money but will go silent when asked how much THEY are gonna contribute. My favorite thing that came out of Reddit was more people telling nosy family members to contribute themselves seeing they care so much. Turn the tables on them and watch em SQUIRM", "I don\u2019t know where you got the idea that I scold people who have kids. I have kids (not that it matters).\n\nHave kids. Try to be a good parent. Don\u2019t have kids. Live your life. Children don\u2019t ask to be born and they\u2019re not indebted to their parents for whatever sacrifices were made.", "It isn\u2019t.  A disabled child will be on Medicaid and ssi.  If the mother had to go back to work they could get a personal care attendant for the child.  Since she is staying home with the child it is assumed she can just take care of her.  I could go on but rest assured that there are many ways for her parents to get aid, it just easier to try to extort it out of your other kid.", "And almost everyone of those people are where they are because of decisions they made. We are each responsible for our own finances.", "An adult should probably contribute to the rent imo.\n\nBut again, you can\u2019t just *take* money from someone. It\u2019s not that hard a concept people.", "Was in that position for years not that long ago. Been slightly better lately so things do get better. Glad you are working hard and I wish you all the luck in the world xx", "Thank you. Thank all of you, so very much. The love and support in these comments has been incredibly moving. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udde1\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9c\n\nI wish you well, too!"]}
