Put a freeze on your social security number with all three credit bureaus. Add security measures like an extra password and two-part verification to all of your bank accounts. Not saying your Dad would commit fraud, just something everyone should do to protect against identity theft. NTA", "Exactly. The only reason this extended family knows she has money is her dad and stepdad TOLD THEM. That\u2019s a major breach of trust and privacy. OP NTA.", "Thank you for being the broken record, I actually needed to hear this today, right now.", "Yeah when did families become a business? Seems like now every parent is telling me their kids have to work the moment its legal, so the kids can pay rent.", "Plus why should OP feel threatened by them \"remembering this when OP needs help?\" They obviously have jack-squat, what could they possibly offer?", "Why on earth should OP give the money back to their mother????? It's OPs money. If anything they should cut off dad and step-mom, they sound like horrible people.\n\nNTA", "This is the way", "Oooh I love how much I am going to hell for cackling at this!!!! Also Opie is NTA.", "Why can't all this family take it in turns to look after Melody instead of sticking thier noses in?", "This and the threat of \u201cwe will remember this\u201d against OP should they POTENTIALLY fall on hard times in the future.  Who threatens their grown children?  You dad should, instead, voice pride for how you\u2019ve handled your college education, finances, and future-planning.  He should be cheering you on for making sound business and career decisions.  \u201cYou don\u2019t worry about us.  We\u2019re so very proud of all you\u2019ve accomplished.  This is not your worry\u201d.  NTA.", "Yes!!!", "Your example isn\u2019t a parent \u201ctaking\u201d money from a child. This sounds very situational/immediate and isn\u2019t at all similar to what OP described or what I referred to in my comment. Plus, you willingly lent knowing that you would have it back rather quickly. OP does not have that comfort.", "If they lived in the civilized world, I guess that medical care wouldn't be such a problem.", "I think this person is suggesting that OP lie to distance these moochers from the money so they'll stop bringing it up. \n\nI agree, this whole situation would ruin my relationship with the dad and stepmom if I were OP.", "I meant for OP to just tell them that she returned the money back to their mother to try and get the family off her back with asking", "Where did you come up with that conclusion? I care very much about my father and my stepmother. Her kids live thousands of miles away and we were all grown adults when they got together.", "Then leave the group chat", "AnyRelationship6927 is a comment stealing bot - this comment is stolen from elsewhere in the thread. Downvote and report so the account can't be used for scams.", "YES! Exactly.", "Well, also, it\u2019s an empty threat. Ok, I will remember that if I ever need time or money, my dad and stepmom - who already have 0 extra time and money - will not help me. Even if they could, which they can\u2019t, so it\u2019s a moot point.", "That's why it was a reply to a comment about \"never\", not a reply t the OP.", "What about adult child living with parents? Should they be forbidden to ask some rent or help with groceries if the offspring works full time and lives there?", "And block everyone so they can\u2019t add them back", "Personally I'd stay in just to stir shit. If anyone started backing out of helping I'd be like \"but didn't you tell me that you found it unacceptable that Dad/Josie don't have x??\"", "I hope things get better for you soon", "Yeah this was my question too. My 21 year old son still lives at home with me. The rule has always been that if my kids are studying or on an apprenticeship/traineeship etc. they don\u2019t have to pay. But since he is working full time, he has to pay board to contribute to household expenses. He pays about a fifth of what he would be paying in rent in our area and 10% of electricity and gas. I do this deliberately not just for the money but also to teach him responsibility and the value of contributing. Because he contributes financially, he has a say over certain decisions in our household. He had plenty of disposable income left over and (hopefully) some good life skills. I don\u2019t see the issue with this.", "Thank you. I'm doing the work to get there, I hope so too, and I appreciate your kind words \u2764\ufe0f"]}
