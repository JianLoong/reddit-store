I started hitting the gym 5-6 times a week. My wife on the other hand started martial arts (after I convinced her), which she has become very passionate about. We have both gotten in really good shape. \n\nOver the past year, we have both made serious progress in our fitness journeys. Though the past month was rough on her. Unfortunately, my wife was laid off from her high-paying job and hasn\u2019t been in a good mental state lately. During this time, she started taking martial arts/ fitness even more seriously than ever before, likely to take her mind off her job search. \n\nOnto the story, a couple of days ago her martial arts gym was closed for the day, and having nothing to look forward to she moped around the apartment since all she was doing was job searching. To take her mind off things I invited her to my gym just before I was about to leave. She excitedly agreed, packed her gym bag, and ran to the car. I am not going to lie, the thought of showing off to my wife got me more pumped up than any prework could. In the back of my head, I was thinking of stuff like \u201cShe\u2019s going to be so impressed with how much I lift.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s stupid, but what guy doesn\u2019t want his wife to think of him as strong/ manly? \n\nWhen we got there, she said she wanted to try mine out, which made me excited because it was chest day. We grabbed a bench and started with her. She was able to put up more weight than I thought she would, I\u2019m not going to lie, I was impressed and I told her so. Then it was my turn, I put on about 5x as much as she was lifting and pushed out a couple of reps. I swear, her being there motivated me more than usual, to the point where I hit a personal record! It was a weight that I had been trying to get to for months. I was super happy and proud of myself! After it hit it, I had a couple of my gym bros congratulate me for reaching my goal. I\u2019m telling you, there\u2019s nothing more motivating than reaching that goal you have been working towards for a long time. However, while my wife was smiling, she was really quiet. \n\nOnce we got home, we took a shower and I started making dinner. Then out of nowhere, right as I was grilling, she started accusing me of purposely showing her up and embarrassing her. I was confused, I hoped she would be proud, not angry with me for lifting so much. After some back and forth, I got angry and said that it was unrealistic to think that she was on my level because not only am I a man who weighs 50-60 pounds more but because she doesn\u2019t lift! I said her expectations were impractical. Besides, with martial arts her build is more cardio-centric anyway. She stormed off and I ate alone that night. \n\nI just wanted her to be proud of me, not to crush what confidence she had left. I know that probably has something to do with the recent layoff as well. \n\nAnyway, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678398676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11n4zrb/aita_for_lifting_more_than_my_wife_at_the_gym/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your achievements have nothing to do with her shortcomings.\n\nYou should definitely talk to your wife. She's clearly in a bad place right now but she can't take it out on you.", "Oh my lanta you are Definitely NTA! I think once she cools down she might realize how selfish she was being by not being supportive of you. I bet a lot of the outburst had to do with being laid off, thats tough! But I hope she comes to you later to apologize, b/c you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Quite clearly NTA. Though, your wife may also be particularly sensitive if she's not in a good place.", "I guess I want to know what she expected. Of course a man who is 50-60 lbs heavier who lifts weights is going to be stronger. I\u2019ve been lifting weights for 11 years and even I know that most men out there are going to be stronger than me.   \n  \n  \nShe\u2019s TA for the immature way she responded, but she needs to read some research on men vs. women weightlifting, testosterone, biology, etc so she understands. She could have just truly been ignorant of this fact. \n  \n  \n  \nNTA.", "NTA. It sounds like you were both seeking the same thing (validation, praise, a little extra \u201cI\u2019m looking good for my partner\u201d boost) but in different ways. NAH. Remind your wife of how proud you are of how far you\u2019ve both come and explain that you were motivated by her presence so much that you achieved your best BECAUSE she was there. Sounds like you guys just had a miscommunication that arose out of mutual admiration with a few ego issues thrown in. It happens. :)", "NTA.  Her expectations were totally out of wack.", "NTA, she's in a bad space mentally as you are well aware.  When things are calm go talk to her. Tell her how excited you were to be able to show off to her and that it hurt you when she accused you of purposely embarrassing her.  Sometimes when we're wrapped up in our own misery, we forget that our spouses have feelings.", "NTA\n\nWhile I understand her self confidence has taken a hit from the job loss, I do not understand why she made this into a competition. That was completely unnecessary. Also, her expectations of being able to lift more than you, when she doesn\u2019t normally lift, were utterly unrealistic. The fact that she basically threw a temper tantrum about it is ridiculous. I think she might need counseling to deal with her lack of self esteem. \n\nCongrats on hitting your goal!", "Obviously NTA.", "NTA being laid off doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to expect other people not to do their best. Your wife clearly is in a sensitive state of mind. No use doubling down, but you did nothing wrong either. Hopefully both of you can let it go. Congrats on hitting your goal. Too bad your wife missed an opportunity to celebrate the win with you.", "I gotta go with NTA here.\n\nI used to lift (back when the years started with \"1\").  Not like the folks who really worked at it, but a decent mostly-Nautilus workout (plus a small amount of free weights and some cardio and stuff) a few times a week.  I got *way* stronger than people who didn't lift at all, pretty much no matter what exercises they did otherwise, as long as they did no regular lifting.\n\nHasn't completely gone away, either.  My wife's into fitness, including regular light work with dumbells and kettle bells and such, and I still have more upper body strength.  She's more fit *overall* (and could probably kick my ass if she felt like it), but I've got more raw upper body strength.  And she wouldn't *imagine* getting irritated with me over this.  (She actually encourages me to get back into regular exercise.)\n\nWe've got different frames (I'm over 6' tall), different bodies, different metabolisms.  This is not a thing ... to feel the way your wife did about what happened.\n\nEDIT: Ran the scenario by my own wife, as I often do, just to give myself a reality spot-check.  She said she agreed that *if* everything played out as above with no embellishments and such, then yeah, NTA, *but*, it's *very* easy for guys in scenarios like this to come across as condescending without intending to.  So, if that happened, if something you didn't *intend* as condescending *came across* as condescending, this may instead be NAH.", "NTA - she's being silly. Of course you can lift more weight than she does, you're a man and you've been working on it for a while. I am very supportive of other women, but being upset because your husband lifted more weight than you, is just insane.", "NTA, good job, Bro. Were all gonna make it.", " NTA her expectations of being equal? to you are wildly unrealistic and also, she shouldn\u2019t be trying to compete with you. Your wins should be wins to her, not losses.", "Obviously she wasn't expecting to lift more than you, that's not the point. She just had a small, proud moment after a hard, depressing month and before she even gets a chance to revel in it you move in and show off (you said you wanted to show off for her) and got everyone else congratulating you. The fanfare and you presumably reveling in it was a bit insensitive. \n\nNAH You could have found a way to still workout and meet your goal without overshadowing her accomplishments but she could have also been a bit more gracious.", "Nta.", "Regardless of the inherent advantage to lifting with testosterone you lift, she doesn't, you're bigger and none of that points to any kind of showing off - NTA", "NTA. She must be a state to think she would be able to lift equal, or even more, weight than you.", "NTA. She got jealous and butt hurt is all. Ne proud of yourself regardless if she is or not. She will get over it.", "ESH.  The way I'm reading this, she wanted to go to the gym and do stuff/ push herself, but you wanted her to watch you and be impressed.  She feels belittled because you acted like a show off, not a partner.  It sounds like unrealistic expectations all around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s fair, but it is pretty normal for people to occasionally project their own stresses and insecurities onto the people closest to us. If it\u2019s part of a bigger pattern, though, I would try to communicate with her and see if maybe counseling or something is in order.", "NTA! If I tried to out-lift my partner I'd end up in the hospital after being crushed by a bar! Lifting is hard and takes a lot of training. You lift 5-6 days a week. She doesn't. I understand how soul-crushing job searching is (going through that as well), but this is over the top. I would approach her with care and talk about the underlying issues.", "I wouldn't call you an asshole but she's in a rut and is feeling insecure.  We don't always make it easy for you to know.  Instead of saying \"you're a man and she doesn't lift\" (which is true...remember we don't always think rationally) what you should have said was \"how about we start with 1 day a week where we go and lift together? It will help build you up for martial arts and its something we can do together and we can map our progress.\"  Maybe even offer to join in one of her classes just to see what she does...or have her show you.", "YTA because you invited her to the gym ostensibly because you wanted to take her mind off her moping around the house but actually wanted to show off and pal around with your gym bros.\n\nYou're not the asshole for lifting more, you're the asshole for thinking that your personal fitness achievements would somehow make her feel better when she's already down.", "Wasn't there one on here last year about a girlfriend getting upset because her boyfriend had been letting her win in play fights and she genuinely thought she was stronger until he casually peeled her off of himself like she was a toddler?  Apparently it shattered her worldview to realize all men had been letting her win the whole time and she wasn't actually strong enough to pull them around like she thought.\nThat one made me laugh a lot, though I felt bad for her.  So, there are definitely people out there who are ignorant of this fact!", "No, she wanted to go to the gym to cheer up", "NTA - I am a personal trainer and I am in much better shape than my husband. But he can absolutely murder me in the weight room. He\u2019s got natural strength. I think it\u2019s HOT and I would never dare think less of myself because I can\u2019t out lift him. Yeah I\u2019m a \u201cprofessional fitness\u201d\u2026 person. I should be able to lift well. I can. But each person is unique and has unique capabilities and strengths. I want my husband to be stronger than me. It\u2019s so bizarre to me that she cared at all\u2026 maybe she\u2019s putting her self worth in the wrong things?", "NAH. I understand your intentions were entirely pure, and you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but I also understand exactly why she took things the way she did. Please just talk to her and offer your support. She is going through a lot right now and, from your description of events, you were thinking entirely about yourself and how impressed she would be with you during this trip she believed you offered her to cheer her up. Is it childish of her to respond in this way? yes. but you must understand the pressure she is putting on herself to succeed right now. She was laid off recently and has likely been rejected from jobs since if she\u2019s still searching. i can absolutely understand how watching my husband lift five times what I can would be my last straw if I had spent months trying so hard to get stronger and feeling like a failure. maybe offer to help her search for jobs? ask her what she needs of you, please, and try very hard to understand what she is saying even if it doesn\u2019t make sense to you. I wish you both the best.", "Men are stronger then women. It\u2019s just a simple fact.", "NTA, congrats on the PB!! I'm a woman who does weights too and it's just life that my legs are stronger than my upper body. I can't lift as much as a lot of blokes at my age with my level of experience. \n\n\nAdd to that  someone who never lifts can't and shouldn't compete with people who do. They'll hurt themselves. It's a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nI do acknowledge that your wife is in a tough spot right now, but she was out of pocket. Hurting is not an excuse to hurt people who love you.", "NTA. Congratulations though.", "NTA. Also you two seem to be doing different routines, so it isn't surprising that you do well at what you put a lot of work into.\n\nGoing along that same line of thought, martial arts might work her muscles in a different way.", "INFO: \n\n1. Did your wife outearn you at her previous job?  \n\n\n\n2. Is your wife a competitive person by nature? \n\n\n\n3. Do you think it might be possible that she once prided herself doing certain things better than you and had hoped that the gym was one of them but was severely disappointed in learning that in reality the opposite is true?", "Small YTA, its obvious she is feeling bad about herself, and saw a chance to feel as if she could be productive and cool! And she was! Then you got on, and made her feel as if it was nothing. \n\n(Despite yes, it being impractical for her to think that way. Trust me she knows the biological differences, but in that moment, she just wanted to feel proud of herself and forget she sucks at stuff). \n\nIn this post, it is all about you showing off, and you doing great. It boils down to the fact that you wanted her to be so proud of you for your ability to lift a lot, and boost you up without recognizing what she is thinking or needs emotionally. \n\nyou are NTA for doing more than her, but you are one for being oblivious to her state emotionally, and then telling her off for being illogical and that she should be more realistic as a woman, while being excited to want similar mental support from her. She's in a sore spot currently and right now she just wants to feel like she isn't a loser at everything", "What a load of bullshit.", "Do you have a link? I'd really like to see her justification for why she isn't an AH", "Right! Just look at records. Running, weightlifting, etc. Men are faster and stronger, period. My dad taught me this fact when I was young. You used the right word- worldview. We have all these action superhero movies out lately portraying women as strong badasses who can take on men in fights. So now women think they\u2019re a match for men physically, and it\u2019s just delusional, honestly.", "I totally agree, in a match of strength there is no contest.  Oh and I love how the women are also managing to do all that in stilettos lmao \n\nI did feel bad for how suddenly vulnerable she had to feel when she realized she wasn't as able to protect herself as she thought she was.  Better to know, of course, but that moment that you realize you couldn't get away even if you tried your hardest is chilling.  Every woman has that moment at some point in her life(often play fighting!) \n\nBiology is what it is!", "you're right about the facts but where did the part about superhero movies being the problem come from.", "That's why I'm always ready to cast pocket sand into the eyes of my foes. I can't take them physically, so I'll just blind them and run. \ud83d\ude2d", "That\u2019s right. I\u2019d rather be humbled here in the safety of my home in a play fight with my husband than go out there in the world thinking I\u2019m a match for the men in these streets.", "For untrained women sure, but I do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and women who had been training for a while can absolutely take on men with less training.", "Meaning the current \u201cworldview\u201d that women are just as physically strong as men, and can take men down successfully. Women superheroes (just as an example) fighting men. Which leads to a worldview, or way of thinking, that women are stronger than or just as strong as men."]}
