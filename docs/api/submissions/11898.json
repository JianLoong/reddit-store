{"id": 11898, "submission_id": "11n4zrb", "title": "AITA for Lifting More Than My Wife at the Gym?", "selftext": "For some context, my wife (29F) and I (31M) got into fitness the past year. I started hitting the gym 5-6 times a week. My wife on the other hand started martial arts (after I convinced her), which she has become very passionate about. We have both gotten in really good shape. \n\nOver the past year, we have both made serious progress in our fitness journeys. Though the past month was rough on her. Unfortunately, my wife was laid off from her high-paying job and hasn\u2019t been in a good mental state lately. During this time, she started taking martial arts/ fitness even more seriously than ever before, likely to take her mind off her job search. \n\nOnto the story, a couple of days ago her martial arts gym was closed for the day, and having nothing to look forward to she moped around the apartment since all she was doing was job searching. To take her mind off things I invited her to my gym just before I was about to leave. She excitedly agreed, packed her gym bag, and ran to the car. I am not going to lie, the thought of showing off to my wife got me more pumped up than any prework could. In the back of my head, I was thinking of stuff like \u201cShe\u2019s going to be so impressed with how much I lift.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s stupid, but what guy doesn\u2019t want his wife to think of him as strong/ manly? \n\nWhen we got there, she said she wanted to try mine out, which made me excited because it was chest day. We grabbed a bench and started with her. She was able to put up more weight than I thought she would, I\u2019m not going to lie, I was impressed and I told her so. Then it was my turn, I put on about 5x as much as she was lifting and pushed out a couple of reps. I swear, her being there motivated me more than usual, to the point where I hit a personal record! It was a weight that I had been trying to get to for months. I was super happy and proud of myself! After it hit it, I had a couple of my gym bros congratulate me for reaching my goal. I\u2019m telling you, there\u2019s nothing more motivating than reaching that goal you have been working towards for a long time. However, while my wife was smiling, she was really quiet. \n\nOnce we got home, we took a shower and I started making dinner. Then out of nowhere, right as I was grilling, she started accusing me of purposely showing her up and embarrassing her. I was confused, I hoped she would be proud, not angry with me for lifting so much. After some back and forth, I got angry and said that it was unrealistic to think that she was on my level because not only am I a man who weighs 50-60 pounds more but because she doesn\u2019t lift! I said her expectations were impractical. Besides, with martial arts her build is more cardio-centric anyway. She stormed off and I ate alone that night. \n\nI just wanted her to be proud of me, not to crush what confidence she had left. I know that probably has something to do with the recent layoff as well. \n\nAnyway, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678398676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11n4zrb/aita_for_lifting_more_than_my_wife_at_the_gym/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your achievements have nothing to do with her shortcomings.\n\nYou should definitely talk to your wife. She's clearly in a bad place right now but she can't take it out on you.", "Oh my lanta you are Definitely NTA! I think once she cools down she might realize how selfish she was being by not being supportive of you. I bet a lot of the outburst had to do with being laid off, thats tough! But I hope she comes to you later to apologize, b/c you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Quite clearly NTA. Though, your wife may also be particularly sensitive if she's not in a good place.", "I guess I want to know what she expected. Of course a man who is 50-60 lbs heavier who lifts weights is going to be stronger. I\u2019ve been lifting weights for 11 years and even I know that most men out there are going to be stronger than me.   \n  \n  \nShe\u2019s TA for the immature way she responded, but she needs to read some research on men vs. women weightlifting, testosterone, biology, etc so she understands. She could have just truly been ignorant of this fact. \n  \n  \n  \nNTA.", "NTA. It sounds like you were both seeking the same thing (validation, praise, a little extra \u201cI\u2019m looking good for my partner\u201d boost) but in different ways. NAH. Remind your wife of how proud you are of how far you\u2019ve both come and explain that you were motivated by her presence so much that you achieved your best BECAUSE she was there. Sounds like you guys just had a miscommunication that arose out of mutual admiration with a few ego issues thrown in. It happens. :)", "NTA.  Her expectations were totally out of wack.", "NTA, she's in a bad space mentally as you are well aware.  When things are calm go talk to her. Tell her how excited you were to be able to show off to her and that it hurt you when she accused you of purposely embarrassing her.  Sometimes when we're wrapped up in our own misery, we forget that our spouses have feelings.", "NTA\n\nWhile I understand her self confidence has taken a hit from the job loss, I do not understand why she made this into a competition. That was completely unnecessary. Also, her expectations of being able to lift more than you, when she doesn\u2019t normally lift, were utterly unrealistic. The fact that she basically threw a temper tantrum about it is ridiculous. I think she might need counseling to deal with her lack of self esteem. \n\nCongrats on hitting your goal!", "Obviously NTA.", "NTA being laid off doesn\u2019t give anyone the right to expect other people not to do their best. Your wife clearly is in a sensitive state of mind. No use doubling down, but you did nothing wrong either. Hopefully both of you can let it go. Congrats on hitting your goal. Too bad your wife missed an opportunity to celebrate the win with you.", "I gotta go with NTA here.\n\nI used to lift (back when the years started with \"1\").  Not like the folks who really worked at it, but a decent mostly-Nautilus workout (plus a small amount of free weights and some cardio and stuff) a few times a week.  I got *way* stronger than people who didn't lift at all, pretty much no matter what exercises they did otherwise, as long as they did no regular lifting.\n\nHasn't completely gone away, either.  My wife's into fitness, including regular light work with dumbells and kettle bells and such, and I still have more upper body strength.  She's more fit *overall* (and could probably kick my ass if she felt like it), but I've got more raw upper body strength.  And she wouldn't *imagine* getting irritated with me over this.  (She actually encourages me to get back into regular exercise.)\n\nWe've got different frames (I'm over 6' tall), different bodies, different metabolisms.  This is not a thing ... to feel the way your wife did about what happened.", "NTA - she's being silly. Of course you can lift more weight than she does, you're a man and you've been working on it for a while. I am very supportive of other women, but being upset because your husband lifted more weight than you, is just insane.", "NTA, good job, Bro. Were all gonna make it.", " NTA her expectations of being equal? to you are wildly unrealistic and also, she shouldn\u2019t be trying to compete with you. Your wins should be wins to her, not losses.", "Obviously she wasn't expecting to lift more than you, that's not the point. She just had a small, proud moment after a hard, depressing month and before she even gets a chance to revel in it you move in and show off (you said you wanted to show off for her) and got everyone else congratulating you. The fanfare and you presumably reveling in it was a bit insensitive. \n\nNAH You could have found a way to still workout and meet your goal without overshadowing her accomplishments but she could have also been a bit more gracious.", "Nta.", "Regardless of the inherent advantage to lifting with testosterone you lift, she doesn't, you're bigger and none of that points to any kind of showing off - NTA", "NTA. She must be a state to think she would be able to lift equal, or even more, weight than you.", "NTA. She got jealous and butt hurt is all. Ne proud of yourself regardless if she is or not. She will get over it.", "ESH.  The way I'm reading this, she wanted to go to the gym and do stuff/ push herself, but you wanted her to watch you and be impressed.  She feels belittled because you acted like a show off, not a partner.  It sounds like unrealistic expectations all around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s fair, but it is pretty normal for people to occasionally project their own stresses and insecurities onto the people closest to us. If it\u2019s part of a bigger pattern, though, I would try to communicate with her and see if maybe counseling or something is in order.", "NTA! If I tried to out-lift my partner I'd end up in the hospital after being crushed by a bar! Lifting is hard and takes a lot of training. You lift 5-6 days a week. She doesn't. I understand how soul-crushing job searching is (going through that as well), but this is over the top. I would approach her with care and talk about the underlying issues.", "I wouldn't call you an asshole but she's in a rut and is feeling insecure.  We don't always make it easy for you to know.  Instead of saying \"you're a man and she doesn't lift\" (which is true...remember we don't always think rationally) what you should have said was \"how about we start with 1 day a week where we go and lift together? It will help build you up for martial arts and its something we can do together and we can map our progress.\"  Maybe even offer to join in one of her classes just to see what she does...or have her show you.", "YTA because you invited her to the gym ostensibly because you wanted to take her mind off her moping around the house but actually wanted to show off and pal around with your gym bros.\n\nYou're not the asshole for lifting more, you're the asshole for thinking that your personal fitness achievements would somehow make her feel better when she's already down.", "Wasn't there one on here last year about a girlfriend getting upset because her boyfriend had been letting her win in play fights and she genuinely thought she was stronger until he casually peeled her off of himself like she was a toddler?  Apparently it shattered her worldview to realize all men had been letting her win the whole time and she wasn't actually strong enough to pull them around like she thought.\nThat one made me laugh a lot, though I felt bad for her.
