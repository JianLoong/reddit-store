They didn't like him and I told him to start looking for a new job because they kept threatening him and I've seen it happen before. He didn't listen and ended up getting put on a PIP plan because he took his first vacation and they didn't like that. I told him to apply for new jobs and he didn't. Lost his job. \n\nHe always loved videography/vido editing so while applying for jobs he wants to also try and do that and try to do that fulltime. It's been months and we haven't gotten ANY unemployment and the few clients he has doesn't even make a dent in helping financially its basically nonexistent at this point. I do not want to tell my husband he can't have his dream job but I told him he needs to find a part time job at least in the meantime so we can get some guaranteed income because its reallt stressing me out and im tired of having zero dollars in my bank account. Our debt is rising from credit cards and we can't pay them off. \n\nI don't eat as well as I used to with groceries and that's frustrsting too to eat twice a day sometimes once. \n\nI keep telling him to put his work on tiktok because it's amazing and all it takes it one video and he cam be his own boss. He hasn't done anything for his own channel in months.\nHe still hasn't even gotten a part time job and I'm at my wits end. \n\nThe holidays are coming up and I can't even afford to give our family any gifts let alone ourselves. I am working my butt off at a job i dont even love to try and get a promotion and raise. I'm even considering getting a part time job because I can't keep doing this anymore. \n\nI keep telling him when you want something you do it but I am just not seeing the same level of want i expected. He says if he goes back to sales then he can't edit because he won't have time. I understand its time consuming but i just feel like at this point he always has an excuse to not do something. Can't work uber because it doesn't pay enough, don't wanna go part time retail because I might as well go back to fulltime, can't do fulltime because then I can't do what I love. \n\nLike the heck??? If we got unemployment i would feel better but we haven't gotten any. At what point do I say enough is enough? Like why is it so hard to get a part time job if you really want this dream of yours? Why doesn't he care? I understand business' don't happen overnight but a PART TIME JOB WON'T STOP YOU. I am tired so tired.

Some people get lucky and go viral and are able to support themselves doing what they love. For some people, that never happens and they will always have to work their day job and just do their dream thing on the side for fun.

NTA\n\nYour husband is likely floundering due to not knowing which way to turn right now, and may benefit from some *gentle* guidance.", "NTA, but if you're young and don't have kids then honestly this might be a fork in the road.", "NTA. There are many ways to monetize genuine skills in video editing.\n\n1. He could look for a standard job in that field. For a lot of these types of jobs, a really good portfolio > a degree, so if he lacks formal education it still shouldn't hold him back. Sure, editing marketing materials, interviews, or other content might not be his passion, but it's not as far from his passion as retail or door dash.\n\n2. He could look for freelance or contract video editing. Maybe it's a lot of wedding video, or maybe he can crack into a field he enjoys working in as a collaborator (editing gaming video, sports reels, short films, etc). People in these spaces need skills like his, and can pay him for the work.\n\n3. He could try to monetize his own, original creative work. This is the hardest one to be successful with, but if he's not even willing to post to a channel, let alone find ways to get eyes on it - this isn't his dream, it's just his avoidance mechanism.", "Info:\n\n\\- Is your husband depressed or have other untreated mental illness (ADHD, anxiety) or otherwise incapacitated from his job loss?\n\n\\- What is the issue with applying for unemployment?", "You say he \"lost his job.\"  Was he fired or did he quit?  Because if he was fired he should be able to get unemployment benefits.\n\nNTA for telling your husband he has to contribute to the household.  If he's not making money at videography then he's not spending that much time on clients.  So he has time to work.  As you realized, a part-time job is not \"giving up on his dream.\"  \n\nNashville and Hollywood are full of people pursuing their dreams while working regular jobs to pay the bills.\n\nThe easiest and most flexible part time work is DoorDash or UberEats.  All you need is a car and a cell phone, and he doesn't have to work if he is busy with a client.", "NTA AT ALL! He has to put his hobby aside. You are getting to the point that you can't survive doing what he is doing so it must change. You can only afford to follow your dream when you can AFFORD to follow your dream!", "NTA, does he not know how many hours people that are starting a new business put in, does he not understand that many of them put those hours in with a paying job due to the new business running/building slow. He has many bad excuses for not helping support his family.", "NTA. He has to grow up, for fox's sake. He can pursue his dreams while not being a burden on the family. Working part-time won't kill him or his dreams, more importantly, it won't kill your budget. He needs to pull his own weight. Right now, he is heading into a tailspin and will benefit from you helping him find the way up. Do that. Be honest with him. It is a great calling in life to support yourself and your family, even if it isn't from a \"dream job\". It can lead to something bigger. Support him to support himself and your family.", "NTA he isn't making the effort for his hobby if he's not uploading videos on a consistent basis.  He shouldn't give up on his dream, but he definitely needs to put in more effort. Videographers can make a good chunk of change, but it requires lots of work, and his editing skills need to be top notch. Making tiktok videos when he feels like it isn't going to cut it. He has to have a niche, and a good way to start is by filming weddings...they make decent money. He has to build up a portfolio of work, get a website built, hire clients in his niche, and have the hardware to support his hobby if he wants it to be his dream job. He should get a regular job in the meantime.", "NTA, you aren't telling him he can't try. Just that he needs to help financially because you all are drowning. You're a team, he's coasting on what you bring to the table. \n\nI understand wanting to be your own boss, not wanting to work the grind and wanting to profit on your passions. I get that, believe me. But when you're a family, and you're struggling, you put things aside to make ends meet. And you curb your expectations. No one who starts their own business should expect to profit within 5 years. You can't make it 5 years, you need his help. If he doesn't see that, then he is the AH.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m all for supporting dreams and goals, but you have to do this within the confines of what is realistic. You don\u2019t have to read the rest of this, but I wanted to share my experience.\n\n\nWhen we were first married my husband used to talk about how he wanted to be a full time musician instead of a music educator. He would tell me about this guy or that guy who he knew from school that seemed to be doing okay playing professionally. So I would say okay then, let\u2019s set up this extra room as a music room so you can practice and pursue that goal. But he half assed it. He told me himself that this guy or that guy would practice for sometimes 8hrs a day, but my husband wasn\u2019t motivated to do that. He would gig some and practice a little but probably didn\u2019t even practice 8hrs in an entire week even though he was only working 40hr/wk. I finally told him he needed to either commit to his \u201cdream\u201d or realize it\u2019s not going to happen. He was fully capable talent wise, but unless he committed to the time it would take then it wasn\u2019t going to happen. I didn\u2019t mind him playing if it was as a hobby or a career, but I couldn\u2019t stand to hear him complain anymore about wishing he had this different life when he wasn\u2019t doing the work to actually give it a fair shot.\n\nFast forward five years and we had a toddler and he was even more miserable in his job teaching music. I would always offer support and suggestions for different career changes but he never was up for it until now. One week he just decided he was going to learn to code and become a software developer. Wasn\u2019t even my idea. For the next year he would work 70+ hours a week (6 days a week for half the year), come home to do dinner and bedtime with our family, then learn coding for 2-4hr every night and did similar stints on the weekends. He now has a very successful career as a software developer. \n\nHe also has a side business (because it\u2019s his dream to be his own boss one day) and he and his partner have been working on that for nearly 5yrs. Their company is just now pulling in 50k annually and neither of them are being paid from it yet. It\u2019s been a point of contention for us as a couple because it is like working a second job and takes time away from the family, but I want to support his dream and this is the most practical way of going about that. And he has generally gotten a lot better with balancing it with family life. Will his business ever be the success he wants it to be? I don\u2019t know. It could, but there are a lot of things that can happen. Whether it does or not doesn\u2019t matter though because he is supporting the family through his day job and balancing his other time with the side business and family. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to be enduring all that you are just to be supportive of your husband\u2019s dreams. Most dreams should be based in reality. If they aren\u2019t, you better be applying some super human commitment to the pursuit of those more unrealistic goals.", "\"i want to support you, but you are not supporting me\"\n\nIe, he's letting (forcing) you take on complete financial responsibility for both your lives. That's not fair.\n\nNTA.", "Does he suffer from anxiety, some of your comments seem like symptoms,  you need to sit down with him, and the bills so he understands how important it is that he\u2019s working.  He may need a written outline in order to check off and motivate him towards his goal", "NTA. People who are self employed full time in most creative jobs start off one of two ways: as a side hustle on nights and weekends after working a full time unrelated job until they build enough business to take it full time and people with family money. My family photographer is a full time teacher. I know two small brewery owners who both work full time jobs in addition to running their businesses. Most artists/musicians/actors have other jobs that pay the bills.\nYour husband CAN continue to build a videography business, while working a full time job. However, and I'm going to be blunt, he's really bad at it. I'm not talking about the end product, I'm talking about building a brand. He isn't putting in the work to build his brand, despite you telling him exactly how to do so-social media. It sounds like he doesn't want to do the unpaid labor necessary to market himself-even when given all the time in the world.  He wants to do work that he loves, but he isn't willing to put in the work necessary to be able to do the work he loves.", "NTA.\n\nNow. The time is now. \n\nHe needs to have income. His dreams come second to meeting the needs of food and shelter. He is sacrificing you to his dream that he\u2019s not putting the effort into making coming true.\n\nPeople don\u2019t fulfill their dreams because it\u2019s a fuckton of 80 hour weeks for years on end. If he can\u2019t realize that there is a price to pay for following a dream, then he will never succeed.", "NTA. Hobbies don't pay the bills and right now his videographer dream is a hobby.", "I think of this alot and am thinking that if I tell him to go back to fulltime and he doesn't keep pursing it on the side that really isn't my fault and I shouldn't feel guilty. I think I put it in my head that if he doesn't succeed or have the opportunity to try its my fault becaude he has told me he can only do this for as long as I allow him too?
