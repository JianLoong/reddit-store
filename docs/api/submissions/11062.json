Addiction is a disease but it does not excuse neglect.\n\nEverything in an addicts behaviour can be explained if you dig deep enough. Growing up the child of an addict is a torture that those that have not experienced it cannot imagine, but to blame the addict for their behaviour is not going to help you heal. \nComing to terms with being the child of an addict takes a lot of work and a great support system whether that be mental health professionals, other family members, friends or support groups. OP is doing a necessary thing by removing themselves from the person that have caused them so much pain.\nThe final twist of the lock that opened the door for me was the recognition that all the resentment, anger and hate I felt was taking up too much space in my life and I had to let it go. In order to do that I had to accept that the addict didn\u2019t do what they did with harm in mind, they simply lacked the ability to see past the next hit/fix/drink. \nNothing about addiction is black and white and assigning blame, looking for acknowledgement and restitution is often a waste of time and energy. I hope OP finds a way to heal and move forward but I also think that the hate directed towards the addict in this thread is misguided, unhelpful and unnecessary.

One can infinitely understand all others if they try, no matter who it is.", "Did you even read my post? No one actually makes choices. For bigger issues like family problems and the life history of someone like a parent, it's well within reason to put it into perspective and understand them.

Please understand this is the case.", "I don't think you understand the point here... No one is talking about \"responsibility\" of course if someone kills another we need to protect society by locking them up or removing them from society. That would be \"responsibility\", however, my point is that retribution and thinking this person could have done otherwise is just in fact incorrect.", "I love Patrick Teahan on YouTube and Dr Nicole LePera on Twitter/IG. \n\nI will check out the second book you commented.

It's great that this kind of thinking worked for you, but it does not work in all cases.", "how is this the conclusion you came to???", "that may very well work for you, but holy shit is it fucked up to tell another victim of abuse how they should feel about it, and repeatedly doubling down when this is pointed out is less than helpful.", "So addicts don't have a responsibility to do better by their family and friends??

I'm saying, here's a pathway you can use to get out of this mindset that will harm you in your life further. Further, the reason you \"should\" take this path is because it's both true and helpful. You're saying \"let everyone who is abused and feels bad about it feel bad and just tell them they're right to feel bad\" ... it's like wtf is that?", "Who are you talking to?", "I'm not going to teach why libertarian free will doesn't exist here.", "Again, understanding isn't tolerance.

The trauma you all must have experienced, for years, must have been intense. You and your siblings are survivors. \n\nYour mother\u2019s addiction is like a possession. She likely would have been a completely different person had she never used. Kids of addicts go through incredible trauma.\n\nShe is probably not capable of facing what she did to her kids. Addiction is sometimes a form of escape from shame and stress. What\u2019s left is a very self centered thinking in the addicted parent. This has nothing to do with you at all. Kids so often feel personally rejected, because there is no more personal relationship than a child with his mother. Her reasoning skills would have been shot, and she would have acted this way with anyone. It\u2019s the addiction. \n\nIf I understand correctly, it sounds like you and your siblings formed your own little family and look out for each other. If so, thank God you have each other, because sometimes kids of addicts form their own little islands, isolate, and become self destructive.\n\nYou need to heal. The betrayal and rightful anger will interfere with your happiness in so many ways in the future. Wounds like this, in childhood, leave terrible scars. It is possible to forgive her yet still stay out of her remaining life. Think of her as a pathetic figure who self destructed, trapped in a prison of her own making. She is a pitiable woman who missed out on the joys of family and motherhood. She missed everything, and there\u2019s no Time Machine to fix anything. You\u2019ll go on to have a full and happy life, and she wasted her life in a living hell. That\u2019s sad. \n\nDon\u2019t hinge your happiness on her acknowledging what she did to you all was wrong. She probably never will. She\u2019s too used to looking out for herself. Don\u2019t hinder your future happiness being angry that your childhood was scary and neglectful. The past happened, but that woman, and that childhood, does not define you. Your survival does. Your character does.\n\nTry watching \u201cCrappy Childhood Fairy\u201d on YouTube and online, and if you haven\u2019t already, check out one of the support groups for adult children of addicts. It can help. This kind of childhood can sometimes lead to Complex PTSD, or CPTSD. Your upbringing was a private battlefield or hell.

My mother was not nearly as bad from the brief sound of it, but bad enough. Her alcoholism affected me before I even knew it had, it would take me years to understand just how fucked up some of the things I went through was.\n\nI also know when I began to stop feeling love for my mother. I was anywhere between 8-12. My mother began a binge to kill all other binges. For anywhere between three days and a week, my mother did nothing but drink. She did this in the kitchen, and as we were scared of her and hiding, my sister and I couldn't get food unless we snuck in and grabbed it. For some reason that I still don't understand fully, she was waiting for us and wanting to \"catch\" us. To talk? To stop us from letting anyone know what was going on? That would make most sense, given this happened for so long and we did have people we could've called. Evidently, we didn't (or couldn't). \n\nI have this memory from this event, that I believed was a dream or my imagination for many, many years, because of my mother denying it and my sister claiming she didn't remember it.\nMy mother was hiding behind a couch in the livingroom, waiting for me to walk by. I couldn't see her. She reached a hand out to grab me, and as I thought she was in the bathroom, this scared me. Deeply. I managed to dance around her, screamed, and ran back into my bedroom.\n\nLong story short, this ended with her going to rehab. When she returned, she was better, and while it never got as bad as the above; she didn't stop drinking. Every weekend, she'd get in varying degrees of wasted-rarely, she timed it badly and hadn't sobered up come Monday so she'd call in sick, but that was the most control she managed. Now, every excuse there is to drink, she takes. She seems to live only for those times, until the next time she can get absolutely shitfaced.\n\nThis is already long, but I want to say this: I'm sorry your mum is dying. I'm sorry that it's meant that you've had to step up. A parent dying is a complicated thing: I've buried one who I loved, and I've come to realise he was not the man I thought he was, and my feelings about him are complicated. \nIf my mother was to get in health problems, I would be the one who'd have to step up out of my siblings, as I'm the only one who lives in the same town. It would be expected of me, and there is no way my siblings nor family in general would be understanding if I didn't. You see, unlike your situation, I'm ironically the only sibling who doesn't love our mum. Your situation is one I'm dreading for myself. And I commend you for saying enough is enough.\n\nYou are NTA. Addicts and/or narcissists can't understand that they're not the hero in others story, because that would mean they aren't in their own. On a good day, I can see that my mother did the best with what she had-on bad days, I remember her hand reaching out for me like a claw when I was not old enough to understand what was happening, and then gaslit for years to believe it never happened.\n\nI've tried to tell my mum many times the impact her alcoholism had on me. That I don't drink because of her. That I don't call her because I don't want to tell her anything. I can tell her sober or drunk: she will shut down, change the subject, or attempt gaslighting me and defend herself to the bitter end.\n\nYou don't owe the people who hurt you anything. Those who can forgive are commendable, but that doesn't mean we all are obligated to it. I wish you good luck navigating the situation, the complicated feelings that may arise (anger? Indifference? Sadness? Relief?), and most of all, the strenght not to give in to your mother guilting you. Addicts may be sick, but they're still responsible for the people they hurt.

I hate people who ask questions they don't want the answer to.\n\nHonestly, as someone whose been on and off dialysis my whole life, you need to speak to the facility about removing you.

About 15 years of in center dialysis (the longest stretch being a decade) and I have *never* heard of them calling the emergency contact to pick a patient up. If it's an emergency they call an ambulance to take you to the hospital, then call the contact to inform them that that has been done and where they were sent.\n\nI've had my own issues and heard others.
