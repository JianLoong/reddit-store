Addiction is a disease but it does not excuse neglect.\n\nEverything in an addicts behaviour can be explained if you dig deep enough. Growing up the child of an addict is a torture that those that have not experienced it cannot imagine, but to blame the addict for their behaviour is not going to help you heal. \nComing to terms with being the child of an addict takes a lot of work and a great support system whether that be mental health professionals, other family members, friends or support groups. OP is doing a necessary thing by removing themselves from the person that have caused them so much pain.\nThe final twist of the lock that opened the door for me was the recognition that all the resentment, anger and hate I felt was taking up too much space in my life and I had to let it go. In order to do that I had to accept that the addict didn\u2019t do what they did with harm in mind, they simply lacked the ability to see past the next hit/fix/drink. \nNothing about addiction is black and white and assigning blame, looking for acknowledgement and restitution is often a waste of time and energy. I hope OP finds a way to heal and move forward but I also think that the hate directed towards the addict in this thread is misguided, unhelpful and unnecessary.

For bigger issues like family problems and the life history of someone like a parent, it's well within reason to put it into perspective and understand them.

Please understand this is the case.", "I don't think you understand the point here... No one is talking about \"responsibility\" of course if someone kills another we need to protect society by locking them up or removing them from society. That would be \"responsibility\", however, my point is that retribution and thinking this person could have done otherwise is just in fact incorrect.", "I love Patrick Teahan on YouTube and Dr Nicole LePera on Twitter/IG. \n\nI will check out the second book you commented.

I'm saying, here's a pathway you can use to get out of this mindset that will harm you in your life further. Further, the reason you \"should\" take this path is because it's both true and helpful.
