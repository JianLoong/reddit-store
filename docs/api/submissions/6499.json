My big sister \\[F21\\] also lives at home, but goes to a \"real\" college nearby (her words). \n\nI've been looking for a part-time job, and asked my sister if the restaurant she waitresses at has any openings. She said said \"maybe\", but that was a few weeks ago and I never followed up. \n\nCut to the issue: she came to my room last week and asked me if I wanted to get lunch with her, and I said \"sure\". I assumed we'd just go through drive-through so I wore fuzzy slippers (the outdoor kind), sweatpants, a HS t-shirt, and my hair was kinda dirty in a bun. I wasn't expecting to see anyone (we've only ever gotten fast food together. We only eat at sit down places with our parents). \n\nWe pulled up to her restaurant and I told her I wasn't really dressed for that so could we eat somewhere else? She said to not worry about it and we went in. She immediately went to say hi to her friend at the hostess stand, and left me with her manager. I thought it was weird that the manager was standing in the front, until she told me I was there for an interview?! \n\nApparently my sister did get me an interview but thought it would be hilarious to embarrass me in front of her coworkers by catching me off guard. I was so shaken, that I immediately said \"sorry, I wasn't expecting this\", turned around and just left.\n\nAt the time my sister died laughing and didn't say much, but apparently she's now facing consequences at work because her manager's really upset at having her time wasted and thought what my sister did was unprofessional and not funny. I don't think she'll get fired, but she had her hours reduced and a formal write-up. \n\nNow my sister's blaming me for making her look bad by not going through with the interview. Her friends have called me mean names making me feel horrible, but I'm so torn. I haven't told my parents yet, because I'm really embarrassed and I don't want to get in trouble.

Not at all professional. \n\nAlso, community college IS real college.

My class sizes at community college were always smaller than the ones at my university (with the exception of a few higher level niche courses I took at my university), which meant my access to the professor and education potential was stronger.

In my experience, managers don\u2019t like it when you refer people to them who are unprofessional.", "I mean, if someone went to my restaurant to eat, I would call that a customer.", ">doing blow\n\nThat escalated quickly", "Going to a restaurant with the internet if getting food makes you a customer regardless of wether or not you order in the end. You still deserve the same degree of hospitality.", "Yep, I used to work in a nightlife area with several blocks of restaurants and bars. We all knew each other and would refer friends all the time.", "And her sisters friends work there. She wouldn't last.", "YOU'RE SISTER IS A GIANT ASSHOLE", "This is made up! How can a 12 year old be a waitress and setting up a referral? \n\nOh wait you said F21. My bad. But then again, a 21 year old would know what\u2019s professionally appropriate and would have friends who aren\u2019t complete idiots. Oh well! \n\nNTA.\n\nMy advice would be to go to the restaurant again, appropriately dressed, ready for the interview. Ask for the manager and tell her \u201cI apologize on my sister\u2019s behalf. I am not sure what came over her that made her behave this unprofessionally. If you would be willing to give me a second chance, I have come prepared this time and will be happy to have you interview me today or I can leave my contact info for when you think it would suit you. Again, please excuse my sister\u2019s behaviour and I hope you wouldn\u2019t see me in the same light.\u201d", "Your sister just played the stupid game and won a stupid prize.", "It sounds like your sister is a nasty, toxic little something. You should get away from her as soon as possible. So I urge you to leave her.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes!", "Think about this from the manager's point of view. She was expecting a prospective hire and spent time creating an interview slot, preparing necessary documentation etc. Your sister arrives and \n\n1. Does not introduce you, the prospective hire. Because of your manner of dress it was ambiguous as to whether you were the person your sister referred.\n\n2. Goes and talks with her friend, leaving you stranded. You're clearly not in your element, and at this point it's becoming clear you don't know what's going on.\n\n3. Brings you in in inappropriate wear. This would have looked bad for her if you'd dressed that way on purpose knowing you had an interview. The fact that you didn't know makes it worse. \n\n4. Brings in someone clearly unaware of the interview. As mentioned, she took some time to set this up, and doing all that just to realize the interviewee was blindsided and not really there for the interview was a slap in the face.\n\n5. Does all this as a joke. Your sister showed that she was not above disrespecting peoples' time, and is willing to engage in juvenile behavior for a laugh.\n\nYou didn't make your sister look bad, OP. She did. NTA.", "NTA and I\u2019d question any friend that says you should\u2019ve \u201cbeen strong\u201d. Your sister needs to grow up.", "What? She dug herself that hole at her employer. Whether you walked further into it after realizing its a pitfall or not thats none of your fault.", "NTA.  And good for you for not going through with what would be for you  a humiliating experience.", "Was prepared to say Y T A from the title, but given you didn\u2019t know you were going to an interview, it\u2019s a definite NTA. Your sister\u2019s manager was correct; it _was_ unprofessional and not funny and if it reflected badly on your sister at work, it\u2019s her own fault.", "NTA your sister was extremely unprofessional and you should tell your parents what she did.  This was all on your sister and no one would want to do an interview in this sort of situation", "NTA. Your sister is though. Tell your parents NOW, before you sister spins a lie to get you in trouble. She's clearly enough of a petty B to do that.", "you shouldn\u00b4t be \"torn\".  She did a bad thing, so she has to deal with a bad consequence. it was entirely her fault", "NTA, she set you up for failure, wasted other peoples time and it\u2019s somehow your fault? Tell your parents before she can mold her own story to tell them.", "Nta, your sister is facing consequences for her own actions.", "AH is not the term I would use for your sister. I think bi+#$ would fit her.", "Your sisters the type of person that would definitely torture someone for fun. NTA", "NTA", "  Your sister is blaming YOU for something she did\\~and was reprimanded by her boss.  NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nYou did the right thing; You said you weren't expecting that, and you left. You didn't make a scene, you didn't scream/swear at your sister, you just left.\n\nQuit questioning what you could've done differently...your sister is the only one who should be doing that!", "Yup.  Sister played a stupid game and won a stupid prize.", "And boss probably has had to deal with her being like this to her coworkers too.", "To be fair, most 4 yos have purer hearts than the average adult.", "This is 100% the most predictable thing that could have happened.  She sounds like she\u2019s very immature for her age and not the brightest.", "Am I the asshole for letting my sisters break my legs? Apparently, she\u2019s facing a ton of legal problems and blames me!!!!", "That's what I'm thinking. Where I live in Florida, many fast food restaurants are operating drive thru only because they are running on a skeleton crew because they can't hire enough people to open the dining area. OPs sister is lucky to be working in this time period, 3-4 years ago she would've been fired.", "There's no doubt it's an asshole move, but there's no reason to ruin her life over it. Firing her is enough to teach her a lesson.", "Nah that's just business. It's standard for the food industry", "That\u2019s just a Tuesday in the restaurant world"]}
