My big sister \\[F21\\] also lives at home, but goes to a \"real\" college nearby (her words). \n\nI've been looking for a part-time job, and asked my sister if the restaurant she waitresses at has any openings. She said said \"maybe\", but that was a few weeks ago and I never followed up. \n\nCut to the issue: she came to my room last week and asked me if I wanted to get lunch with her, and I said \"sure\". I assumed we'd just go through drive-through so I wore fuzzy slippers (the outdoor kind), sweatpants, a HS t-shirt, and my hair was kinda dirty in a bun. I wasn't expecting to see anyone (we've only ever gotten fast food together. We only eat at sit down places with our parents). \n\nWe pulled up to her restaurant and I told her I wasn't really dressed for that so could we eat somewhere else? She said to not worry about it and we went in. She immediately went to say hi to her friend at the hostess stand, and left me with her manager. I thought it was weird that the manager was standing in the front, until she told me I was there for an interview?! \n\nApparently my sister did get me an interview but thought it would be hilarious to embarrass me in front of her coworkers by catching me off guard. I was so shaken, that I immediately said \"sorry, I wasn't expecting this\", turned around and just left.\n\nAt the time my sister died laughing and didn't say much, but apparently she's now facing consequences at work because her manager's really upset at having her time wasted and thought what my sister did was unprofessional and not funny. I don't think she'll get fired, but she had her hours reduced and a formal write-up. \n\nNow my sister's blaming me for making her look bad by not going through with the interview. Her friends have called me mean names making me feel horrible, but I'm so torn. I haven't told my parents yet, because I'm really embarrassed and I don't want to get in trouble. My friends are split between thinking I should have tried to be strong and finish the interview but others are supportive of my decision.

It all points to your sister being a cruel hateful unprofessional person.  She deserved the write up and reduced hours at work because SHE purposely made the conscious choice to waste her manager\u2019s time.  That alone was enough for her to be reprimanded. Not to mention I\u2019m sure it made the manager extremely uncomfortable and feeling awkward by your appearance and lack of knowledge of the interview.  I\u2019m guessing the manager probably felt horrified and embarrassed too. \n\nShe\u2019s 21 years old. She\u2019s old enough to act like an adult instead of a four year old. And truly, I know four year olds with purer hearts and intentions. \n\nShe was just cruel and malicious. I\u2019d definitely inform your parents about it. Even if they can\u2019t do anything about it since you\u2019re both adults, letting her get away with her bad behavior by hiding it from them is never going to help her and only enables her behavior. She will continue to emotionally abuse you if you don\u2019t set boundaries and refuse to Tolerate her abuse.", "NTA.  Your sister is a total AH.  That's pretty close to sociopathic behavior.  I'm not a psychologist admittedly but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.", "Oh you\u2019re sure as hell NTA.\n\nThe mistake made was by your sister.  I\u2019m not sure where on earth she got the idea to INTENTIONALLY bring an unprepared person for an interview in front of HER boss at HER place of employment, but that has to be one of the dumbest pranks I\u2019ve ever heard of.  What did she expect?  Even if you did stay for the interview, he\u2019d know you were very unprepared, and your sister would still be laughing her ass off in front of everybody over it, and she\u2019d still receive the same consequences.  Your sister is a moron.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is a complete AH and I doubt she did any of this with actual good intentions.", "NTA.    That was ***pure cruelty*** on your sister's part, and she knows it.

Even if you had gone through with the interview, she would still be wasting her managers time and was being unprofessional. Tell your parents ASAP", "NTA\n\nShe lied to you and knowingly and willingly brought you into an extremely uncomfortable situation and then proceeded to laugh at you. Her behaviour is inappropriate and straight-up abusive. All the repercussions she faces are justified, though maybe not enough, given the severity of her actions.

She's facing some consequences of her actions and that's good.", "NTA.\n\nNo way... your sister did this to herself. You can't just spring something like that on someone! That was BS from your perspective as well as her manager's perspective. Your sister is the AH here.", "Absolutely no way in Heaven, Hell, or Earth are you an AH. NTA a million times over.\n\nYour sister is a cruel bully. She deserved the right up and to have her hours reduced, she made a stupid choice to be unprofessional and try to publicly humiliate you, and she got consequences.

You handled this perfectly, and she owes you an apology.", "NTA\n\nSister is though. And I commend her coworkers for seeing it so.", "NTA. Your sister screwed up. I would have reacted the same as you did. We weren't all born to be \"cool\" when pranked like that.", "NTA\n\nYour sister sure behaved as one.  Setting up an interview and not telling you?  Wow.  That is a total AH move and she deserved the write up she got.  She let (encouraged you?) to walk in looking like you just crawled out of bed\u2026. Not at all professional. \n\nAlso, community college IS real college.  The classes are generally the same content as what is offered at a 4-year university for most classes that transfer, but they also offer additional coursework and assistance.  What you are doing is saving a LOT of cash compared to taking the classes at a 4-year university.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad it backfired on her.", "NTA. Your sister is not a nice person. She is a bully, at best. That she set up this situation just to embarrass you is nothing you need to be ashamed of and I hope the manager keeps a close eye on her going forward.  Tell your parents exactly what she did.", "NTA sister was trying to do you over and it backfired. Call her boss and apologise for HER behaviour and ask for a proper interview, don't tell her of course, give yourself a chance to swap roles and be TA", "NTA.\n\nI honestly don't understand where your sister's head was at. She set you up to turn up unprepared, which actually was going to reflect poorly on her as the referrer even if you'd stayed for the interview. So, even if she hadn't made her actions evident by pissing herself laughing, she would still likely be facing an unhappy manager.\n\nI don't blame you for not going through with the interview, but it might be worth - if they've not already filled the post - contacting the manager and apologising for what happened and asking if there is still the opportunity to interview. Yes, completely not your fault, but an apology that she had her time wasted could help with the manager. Of course, you might first want to consider whether you'd want to risk working in the same place at the same time as your sister after what she's just done.", "NTA. You shouldn't feel horrible for HER horrible behavior. She f**ked around, and then definitely found out. She deserves every bit of those consequences.", "NTA, your sister made a very stupid decision to try to embarrass you (in a not funny way may I add) and now she's facing the repercussions. Ignore her and her friends.", "Yeah, pranking the boss is never a good idea.  She is wholly responsible for any consequences of her actions.

That was stupid and immature  of her", "NTA: your sister done goofed for what she did. The manager was right to be frustrated with her. That was unprofessional and inappropriate. Not to mention humiliating for you?", "NTA this is 100% your sister's fault", "NTA. Who sets up an interview as a surprise blind date, wtf? You are under no obligation to participate in something you didn't agree to and prepare for. You behaved 100% appropriately and professionally. Your sister did not and absolutely deserves the consequences of her actions.", "NTA, what your sister did was cruel and unprofessional. I'm glad she had professional consequences. Getting her friends to bully you after that is also just... wild. Tell your parents immediately.", "NTA, your sister did something that would get most people fired and her friends don't have a clue about what is right or wrong and are just siding with her because they like her. That is just as rude as it gets.", "NTA. Your sister seem to have forgotten to leave the popular, mean girl bully attitude back at high school where it belongs. \n\nShe\u2019s 21.

She can deal with the consequences.  If you want though, you might consider going to the manager or writing to the manager to just say that you did not know there was going to be an interview that day, and just got flustered and embaressed in the moment as you were not at all prepared, you would never go to an interview dressed like that, and that you are sorry for the confusion and that their time was wasted. It would be the polite and mature thing to do, even though you the AH here.", "NTA. Your sister played stupid games and won stupid prizes.", "NTA. Your sister SHOULD get fired for pulling that crap.", "What in the world? No, of course NTA. Your sister wasted everyone's time solely to humiliate you, and saw nothing wrong with it.

Her implication that she's smarter (via the \"real college\" comments) is pretty ironic, considering what a stupid stunt this was.", "NTA- your sister messed up not you. And even if you had stayed for the interview and let the manager know that you never would have shown up looking the way you did if you had known it was an interview it still would have made your sister look like a giant ass. No matter what you had done it still would have reflected badly on your sister because she wasted everyone's time and tried to make both you and her manager look like a fool.

She FAFO, it was cruel and not at all funny and now she has to face the consequences.", "Absolutely NTA. She purposely set you up for failure and that\u2019s incredibly shitty. Her manager is right, what she did was very unprofessional and not funny.\n\nAlso INFO: have her friends given you the opportunity to explain the actual context of what happened or were you able to tell them? Because I have a feeling she\u2019s twisting the story to continue to make you look bad. Now if they do know the real story and still defend her yet attack you, that\u2019s messed up. I hope you can set up a point where you don\u2019t have to interact with them.", "NTA. Your sister got herself in trouble trying to embarrass you. That's on her. You should formally apologize to her manager and let them know you were blindsided.", "NTA - You did nothing wrong. (If you had toughed it up and gone through the interview, that would have been plus points for you. Might have gotten a job.)\n\nThe manager isn't mad because you didn't interview, they are mad because your sister lied to them about you. The manager is mad that they were used as a tool in a prank between sisters. The manager isn't mad at you at all. Your actions aren't what angers the manager.
