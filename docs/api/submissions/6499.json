My big sister \\[F21\\] also lives at home, but goes to a \"real\" college nearby (her words). \n\nI've been looking for a part-time job, and asked my sister if the restaurant she waitresses at has any openings. She said said \"maybe\", but that was a few weeks ago and I never followed up. \n\nCut to the issue: she came to my room last week and asked me if I wanted to get lunch with her, and I said \"sure\". I assumed we'd just go through drive-through so I wore fuzzy slippers (the outdoor kind), sweatpants, a HS t-shirt, and my hair was kinda dirty in a bun. I wasn't expecting to see anyone (we've only ever gotten fast food together. We only eat at sit down places with our parents). \n\nWe pulled up to her restaurant and I told her I wasn't really dressed for that so could we eat somewhere else? She said to not worry about it and we went in. She immediately went to say hi to her friend at the hostess stand, and left me with her manager. I thought it was weird that the manager was standing in the front, until she told me I was there for an interview?! \n\nApparently my sister did get me an interview but thought it would be hilarious to embarrass me in front of her coworkers by catching me off guard. I was so shaken, that I immediately said \"sorry, I wasn't expecting this\", turned around and just left.\n\nAt the time my sister died laughing and didn't say much, but apparently she's now facing consequences at work because her manager's really upset at having her time wasted and thought what my sister did was unprofessional and not funny. I don't think she'll get fired, but she had her hours reduced and a formal write-up. \n\nNow my sister's blaming me for making her look bad by not going through with the interview. Her friends have called me mean names making me feel horrible, but I'm so torn. I haven't told my parents yet, because I'm really embarrassed and I don't want to get in trouble.

Not at all professional. \n\nAlso, community college IS real college.

Your sister SHOULD get fired for pulling that crap.", "What in the world? No, of course NTA. Your sister wasted everyone's time solely to humiliate you, and saw nothing wrong with it.

My class sizes at community college were always smaller than the ones at my university (with the exception of a few higher level niche courses I took at my university), which meant my access to the professor and education potential was stronger.

She's a bully who does not want to see you succeed in any way. And you 100% made the right call. Her immature actions caused herself to get written up and rightfully so.", "NTA that was not funny.

I was ready to fly in here and rip you to shreds based on the title. \n\nBut nope, NTA. Your sister played a mean prank for laughs and now her manager sees her for who she is and is putting her in her place. I think I would have gone a step further and put her on some kind of probation and then closely examine her for the next 30-90 days. If she ever displays that mean girl bs or wastes time at work, instant firing since she was already formally written up. \n\nNGL.. your sister is kind of awful. The \u201creal college\u201d insults and the fact that she blames you and has convinced her friends to blame you too\u2026 like, does she suffer from main character syndrome or something?

So you're likely already a little annoyed, and not feeling taken seriously. Then the interviewee reveals that they didn't know about the interview and leaves hurriedly, while your employee who referred them and was supposed to tell them about the interview laughs uproariously.

Please tell you parents about this, OP, as they may want to address this with her. You are SO NTA - my heart goes out to you for having this happen to you. \n\nMy second piece of advice is to write a note to the manager, expressing your regret that they were made a party to this nasty prank of your sister's, and that you wish your meeting had happened under different circumstances. This is not as an expression of guilt (for you bear none), nor a request for a second chance (because with your sister still there, work would be WAY too awkward), but simply a professional, mature gesture of respect on your part.", "This sounds like my sister.

The manager, who's a virtual stranger to the OP? Do you expect the manager to be a playground monitor? Do you really want managers to penalize their employees for things they say **off the clock, to non-coworkers?**", "Good idea. \nIt shows youbare more mature than your older sister.", "That would have been great karma.\n\nThis is where I see OP with questions unrelated to the main AITA question.

She was unprofessional just as her manager has said she is.", "NTA, your sister is a bully, what a horrible thing to do to someone.
