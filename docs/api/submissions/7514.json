I'm sorry but YTA.", "YTA; a joke is meant to be funny", "YTA\n\nYou made her feel rejected and like you don't actually like her.

For a person in their 40s, that's really sad.\n\nPranks are often hurtful. They're meant to entertain everyone except for the person being pranked. Everyone is laughing AT the person being pranked, not with them. Also, you barely know Amanda - this was her first Christmas with you. She doesn't know how you are, that if you're the jokester and all that.\n\nYou need to learn some common decency. For you to pull a prank, you need to establish a relationship with them.

Because you won't get it from me. Nor do I blame her for walking out of the gift exchange. If you started with a lump of coal, what was going to be next? A scorpion? A steaming pile of dog poo?

Major league, asshole.", "YTA. A young girlfriend of 5 months is not someone to try out your \u201cfunny\u201d demeaning jokes on.", "YTA. Pranks are only funny if the other person finds it funny too. Otherwise you need to apologize for hurting the person. You screwed up, so suck it up and apologize sincerely.

OP, if you give a garbage gift as a joke to literally anyone, even if you have also gotten them something nice, you are an asshole. It is a rare person who can take \"jokes\" like this in stride. It is not funny. It is cruel and it would make me question whether I would want to ever be part of your family in the long run.
