Maybe, but in all honesty it took her two solid effing months to apologize for being a disrespectful asshole to ludicrous degrees. She practically spat out your food, declared it the nastiest thing she'd ever eaten(which I doubt) and huffed about it. This from a woman who is too fundamentally incapable to do basic fucking cooking. Fuck that. Were the genders swapped people would be absolutely dunking on her.\n\nHowever, at this point it's not even really about the pancakes, it's as they say around here, \"not about the iranian yogurt\" it's the principle of the matter. The bare basic respect for effort given, and the general lack of anything even approaching humility from her.

Did you even ask if she has texture issues (i.e. sensory integration.) Did you ask her why she reacted this way? I keep going back to your ages thinking there must be a typo. \n\nBoth of you need to learn to communicate. I'm not one to say get out, but if it's not too late you should annul the marriage or if it is too late, talk to a lawyer about a divorce. Therapy if for some reason you feel the need to stay together. But if that's they case why would you want to be in such an unhealthy relationship? Petty is one thing, but this is not how you act if you care and love someone, especially your spouse.\n\nAnd for the future since you appear utterly clueless: kids won't like or eat a lot of what you make, no matter how good your kitchen skills might be. It's the food, color, texture, their mood, the weather.

And not just because you refused to let it go, OP.\n\nYour wife said yes to blueberry pancakes.

That she was literally expecting pancakes with fresh fruit on top? At the very least, did her very aggressive response not even give you pause to consider that maybe, just maybe, you two had a *miscommunication*? Apparently not.\n\nI know many people who have very strong feelings about certain fruits being cooked (meaning, they won't eat them when they're cooked, even if it's just into a pancake).  They wouldn't touch a blueberry pancake like you made with a ten foot pole.\n\nWhat your wife did was rude, sure, but you don't seem to think you did *anything* wrong before her little performance. Maybe instead of assuming her ignorance was the issue, you could've just *asked* her if her expectation of \"blueberry pancakes\" was truly regular pancakes with blueberries on top.\n\nWhy did she wait two months to apologize? Hmm, I wonder. Have you even spoken with her about this? Or did you just pettily wait for an apology all this time?", "ESH\n\nShe made it clear she was expecting blueberries *on* the pancakes, not inside them.\n\nYou completely ignored her, and even went so far as to insist that she would love the pancakes your way.  She did not.  It never occurred to you that you might be in the wrong, and that *you* could also broach the subject and apologize.  You\u2019re an AH.\n\nYou\u2019re also a petty AH for refusing to cook for her for months and leaving her to microwaved meals over this.  She went from wanting to learn to cook from you to eating microwaved trash.\n\nShe is a grown woman and didn\u2019t need to gag at the table.

I 100% agree with you taking a stand, she was rude, unappreciative, and just downright an asshole.....but are you really going to go the rest of your married life without cooking for her again?

I hate how sexist this sub is. Had a woman not taken advice on her way of cooking from her non cooking husband and he reacted that way to her cooking it would be a huge issue. He\u2019s not wrong for not cooking for her and she was out of line. The fact that she didn\u2019t apologize for 2 months is also a huge issue. She hurt him and didn\u2019t acknowledge it until she was tired of being inconvenienced by eating tv dinners.", "NTA. What she did was seriously insulting and hurtful.

If she was actually sorry for what she did she could have said something sooner, it sounds more like she's fed up of microwave meals at this point.   \nShe could have also spoken to you about not liking blueberries cooked like that, instead she threw a fit and acted as though that was totally fine.", "ESH- neither of you sound mature enough to legitimately be married.  \n\nYour wife threw a straight up tantrum over pancakes and acted like a toddler in tasting them.

She\u2019s not going to like everything you cook. She apologized. Get over it.

They are both assholes! Their communication with each other is non-existent! The wife sucks more than the guy here because that overreaction to the food is just insulting, and to not apologizesooner is ridiculous. But the fact that he could not just take a moment to sit down with her and explain that her behavior hurt him blows my mind. Instead, his solution is to stop cooking for her and wait for her to read his mind. Then he continues to be an ass after she attempted to make amends. They both seem very prideful,  and terrible at communicating. They either grow up or that marriage won't last.", "They have been married for six months and behaving this way for 2 of them.

I do all the cooking and I try to make what everybody likes. At least taste it.  If I get too many complaints I'll make some shit the way I like it which will feel like your asshole is on fire.

She then had a tantrum over that.  And now he's having a tantrum, over her tantrum.  Sounds like a miserable relationship, and it almost sounds like they deserve each other.\n\n>My wife threw a weird sort of fit, asking me \"What the hell are you doing??\" very aggressively.

He states he's the one primarily cooking. So presumably he's cooked while they dated and after they married. Furthermore he stated he's making blueberry pancakes. If she wanted them on the side, she should have said something BEFORE he added the blueberries to the batter. Plus she was the one who asked to be taught how to cook. Its rude to complain when someones teaching you how to cook and even ruder to not eat the food.

I don't understand the Y T A vote personally.", "Well... I would argue that ESH.

This wasn't about her liking/disliking it.", "Excellent point! \n\nIt's not as if he beat her up, he just decided not to share meals.

And then to not make food for her for 6 months holy shit he needs therapy.", "That theatrical fake gag? She KNOWS the behavior hurt him. That was the point of why she did it. She was punishing him for not obeying her. I really don't see what he has done wrong here. I think not cooking for someone who pretends to throw up when the food doesn't suit them is perfectly understandable. The only reason she apologized after all that time was likely because she got tired of eating her own subpar cooking.", "Maybe they were trying to say You Don\u2019t Know How it Feels\u2026", "lol ya I guess you\u2019re right. It\u2019s all terrible", "Because I think OP would benefit from asking himself what would soothe his feelings?

Self-reflection isn't unreasonable to prompt.", "Yeah, she didn't say \"I don't like blueberries cooked into my pancakes. She said \"What the hell are you doing?\" This means she doesn't know that that's a normal thing. It's one thing to not prefer something and communicate it.

She had it in her head that the blueberries do not belong in the batter. Make both and then prove her wrong. \n\nBut seriously you guys need to learn to communicate better. Like now.

You should be best friends who always want to see the best for each other, and who are willing to admit when you\u2019re wrong and apologize to each other. Instead you two are out here tearing each other down and holding onto petty little hurts to the point where they\u2019re blowing up into huge, potentially marriage ending, issues. What\u2019s the point of being married if y\u2019all are gonna do this shit??? \n\nYou both need to grow the fuck up and learn how to communicate like adults. You\u2019re married and building a life together, not every little issue needs to turn into some big high school drama. All relationships have a give and take, and no one can be perfect all the time. You both need to learn to admit when you\u2019re wrong, and apologize to each other instead of letting situations fester this way. If you don\u2019t want to do that, well, I\u2019d just file for divorce now because your marriage is going to turn into even more of a toxic shitshow than it already is.", "W\"hat is required for you to move on? An apology is not enough for you (and that is fine), she can't turn back time an apologise 2 months ago so what do you need? If you can't answer that, then she surely can't. Is that it? You never cook again for her? I say NTA but you could be if you don't have a plan for eventually moving on (or out).", "NTA. you're doing the thing most people hate doing in a marriage/relationship (cooking) and then she complains about it. I mean hello!?!\n\nAnd yes you shouldn't have to ask for an apology for something so obvious.

Y'all need to work on your communication or inane petty shit like this is going to nuke your relationship. Was your wife dramatic and immature in her response? Yes. Should she have apologized sooner? Yes. Should you have told her you were hurt by her reaction instead of giving her the silent treatment? Yes. \n\nPlaying games with eachother's emotions is going to get exhausting quick. I learned early on in my relationships that when I ignored my partner's preferences (things like \"I don't like blueberries in my pancakes\") and waved them off and just being overdramatic, that would just invited disappointment on their end and frustration on mine. *It's easier to just listen to them the first time.* Wife doesn't want blueberries? No worries. Separate the batter and make yours with blueberries, hers without. Takes an extra 10 seconds to separate the batter and everyone gets what they want.  \n\nInstead of pushing forward and ignoring their preference, if I want to coax them into trying something new, I communicate why it's delicious and ask if they'd want to try it. Half the time they say yes, or try a bite of mine when we eat so they can know whether they want it that way next time. It's not hard to be understanding and to listen. At the end of the day it comes down to this -- Where do you want to put your energy? Right now, both of y'all sound exhausting.", "NTA bro. Run.

Now decide to get the fuck over it.", "NTA. Talk about over reacting. My partner tends to cook for me whilst I wash up, because he\u2019s more confident in the kitchen than me.

Immature, unappreciative and petty.", "NTA\n\nShe childish....", "NTA\n\nYeah reverse the roles and all these ,\"you have to communicate\" ESH ppl would be screaming bloody murder for his treatment of his wife.", "I really feel like this is not about the blueberry pancakes.\n\nHow is the rest of your relationship? Is this sort of rude outburst - extreme passive aggressive response a common thing?\n\nShe was very rude. I would be hurt too. But months is a very long time to not sort this out like adults.", "NTA. She was very rude, condescending about a topic she knows nothing about by her own admission, then doubled down on being rude only to prove she wasn't wrong. When she obviously was.

If you're still upset, you both need to talk things out, and honestly, you both should've talked 2 months ago. Don't get me wrong, she should've spoken to you instead of acting that way about the food in the first place, but also, you've now spent two months building walls between you and her, instead of addressing the actual problem. I'm gonna guess you didn't have siblings growing up to figure this out with, but you need to be open and honest about how this felt, and then you need to be open to giving her a chance again. You don't have to cook every meal, but you probably need to plan that out.\n\nAlso, now she's likely going to think she can't give her opinion at all, so you two should probably just talk about how to go about that now in a way that is kind and considerate of both of you.", "ESH\n\nIf she didn't like it, she should have just been poilte about it & not hurtful & she should have apologized sooner, sincerely \n\nIf it hurt you, you should have said so & communicated.

As the main cook in my family, if my husband tells me he doesn't like something, I don't try to force him to eat it.

I might think about some preventative maintenance and get some counseling. Good luck.", "ESH.  Both of you need to grow up.", "ESH - Like come one now.\nThere is no way you don't see how foolish this is right?\n\nShe freaked out because blueberries were going into the pancakes. Instead of asking why are you putting blueberries in the batter. If she never had the berries in batter, she must be looking at you like why are you trying to ruin her food. But she should of asked for a plain pancake when she noticed what you were doing. But you should of also noticed. That maybe she didn't like her pancakes like that.\n\nShe then was dramatic about the meal and rejected it without even fully trying it. Once again not cool. Dramatic and childish on her part. You decide to not cook for her for two months. And don't say anything to her. Not explaining why and how she hurt your feelings. That's childish on your end too. \n\nNow she is finally trying to make amends in this weird stubborn feud you guys are having. And instead of trying to meet her in the middle.

You get angrier that it took her so long to apologize.\n\nLike wouldn't it be better at this point to just sit her down and say this is how you made me feel and by waiting so long to apologize I feel like you don't respect me. So I will continue not cooking for you, but I would like to do something to help repair our relationship. Then you two talk about what that could be. Like maybe you teach her a few simple things to make for herself. Then maybe you know cooking for herself, like actually cooking and not frozen meals. Would teach her to appreciate the process.\n\n (Tho personally I HATE blueberries in my pancakes as well.

There is no universe in which that is a meaningful apology.\n\nIt's funny how this sub responds to minor heat-of-the-moment disagreements with divorce, but in response to issues such as this - long term behaviour clearly demonstrating a significant underlying personality flaw - noone mentioned a word of it: If OP stays in this relationship he will be miserable, people who are pathologically incapable of admitting wrongdoing absolutely leech the happiness of their partner.
