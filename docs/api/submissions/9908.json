Maybe, but in all honesty it took her two solid effing months to apologize for being a disrespectful asshole to ludicrous degrees. She practically spat out your food, declared it the nastiest thing she'd ever eaten(which I doubt) and huffed about it. This from a woman who is too fundamentally incapable to do basic fucking cooking. Fuck that. Were the genders swapped people would be absolutely dunking on her.\n\nHowever, at this point it's not even really about the pancakes, it's as they say around here, \"not about the iranian yogurt\" it's the principle of the matter.

Did you even ask if she has texture issues (i.e. sensory integration.) Did you ask her why she reacted this way? I keep going back to your ages thinking there must be a typo. \n\nBoth of you need to learn to communicate. I'm not one to say get out, but if it's not too late you should annul the marriage or if it is too late, talk to a lawyer about a divorce. Therapy if for some reason you feel the need to stay together. But if that's they case why would you want to be in such an unhealthy relationship? Petty is one thing, but this is not how you act if you care and love someone, especially your spouse.\n\nAnd for the future since you appear utterly clueless: kids won't like or eat a lot of what you make, no matter how good your kitchen skills might be. It's the food, color, texture, their mood, the weather.

And not just because you refused to let it go, OP.\n\nYour wife said yes to blueberry pancakes. When she reacted with horror at you adding the blueberries into the batter, you dismissed her 100% -- even went out of your way to insist that she would ***like*** them.\n\nDid it never occur to you, OP, that she wasn't expecting pancakes with blueberries in them, as you thought? That she was literally expecting pancakes with fresh fruit on top? At the very least, did her very aggressive response not even give you pause to consider that maybe, just maybe, you two had a *miscommunication*? Apparently not.\n\nI know many people who have very strong feelings about certain fruits being cooked (meaning, they won't eat them when they're cooked, even if it's just into a pancake).  They wouldn't touch a blueberry pancake like you made with a ten foot pole.\n\nWhat your wife did was rude, sure, but you don't seem to think you did *anything* wrong before her little performance. Maybe instead of assuming her ignorance was the issue, you could've just *asked* her if her expectation of \"blueberry pancakes\" was truly regular pancakes with blueberries on top.\n\nWhy did she wait two months to apologize? Hmm, I wonder. Have you even spoken with her about this? Or did you just pettily wait for an apology all this time?", "ESH\n\nShe made it clear she was expecting blueberries *on* the pancakes, not inside them.\n\nYou completely ignored her, and even went so far as to insist that she would love the pancakes your way.  She did not.  It never occurred to you that you might be in the wrong, and that *you* could also broach the subject and apologize.  You\u2019re an AH.\n\nYou\u2019re also a petty AH for refusing to cook for her for months and leaving her to microwaved meals over this.  She went from wanting to learn to cook from you to eating microwaved trash.\n\nShe is a grown woman and didn\u2019t need to gag at the table.  That was an overreaction.\n\nYou\u2019ve only been married six months, and you are already both committing to months-long grudges.

I think you know it. There's an important concept nobody ever taught us in school: \"Do you want to be right, or do you want to be happy?\"\n\nYes, your wife's reaction to proper blueberry pancakes was over-the-top, outrageous, and rude. The mature response to that is to tell her how much she hurt your feelings, and talk it out, and put it behind you. Passive aggressively cooking for yourself *isn't going to solve the problem* \u2013 and fast food is both unhealthy and expensive.\n\nYou just got married. Unless you just want to be miserable at home, swallow your pride and let her make it up to you.\n\nMarried life is going to throw worse curves at you than breakfast. Develop communication skills so you and your wife can get through things together.", "Yes, you are wrong not to drop it.  In a marriage,  you cannot maintain long punishments and blames, especially after your partner has apologized and learned from their mistakes. \n\nOtherwise you will continually be fighting the same arguments.", "NTA, is your wife a toddler?", "Esh- do you want to be right or do you want to be happy? I 100% agree with you taking a stand, she was rude, unappreciative, and just downright an asshole.....but are you really going to go the rest of your married life without cooking for her again? That's not sustainable. Marriage is compromise and forgiveness. You forgive and she can comprise by cooking atleast 1/2 of the time, she may suck but she'll learn", "NTA. I hate how sexist this sub is. Had a woman not taken advice on her way of cooking from her non cooking husband and he reacted that way to her cooking it would be a huge issue. He\u2019s not wrong for not cooking for her and she was out of line. The fact that she didn\u2019t apologize for 2 months is also a huge issue. She hurt him and didn\u2019t acknowledge it until she was tired of being inconvenienced by eating tv dinners.", "NTA. What she did was seriously insulting and hurtful. If someone acted that way after I went to the trouble to prepare them breakfast from scratch I'd tell them to make their own food from now on. Why would she even want to eat your cooking if it made her want to puke, anyway?", "NTA if she didn't want cooked blueberries then that's one thing, she could have told you that, instead she freaking out at her own misunderstanding of something you're trained in, made a fool of herself, repeatedly insulted the cooking you put time into, and then waited TWO MONTHS before bringing it up again and apologising. If she was actually sorry for what she did she could have said something sooner, it sounds more like she's fed up of microwave meals at this point.   \nShe could have also spoken to you about not liking blueberries cooked like that, instead she threw a fit and acted as though that was totally fine.", "ESH- neither of you sound mature enough to legitimately be married.  \n\nYour wife threw a straight up tantrum over pancakes and acted like a toddler in tasting them.  This isn\u2019t how adults act.\n\nYou held a petty ass grudge for over two months with no end in sight.\n\nYour marriage won\u2019t last another year if you both don\u2019t grow the hell up.", "ESH.

She\u2019s not going to like everything you cook. She apologized. Get over it. It took her two months to apologize because you\u2019re being a passive aggressive AH about her not liking something you cooked. Cooked blueberries have a different texture and taste and a lot of people actually don\u2019t enjoy them in baked goods. Apologize to your wife for being an AH and move on and stop throwing a tantrum if someone doesn\u2019t like something you cook.

Are you going to punish her for the next 50 years over her pancake rudeness? Don\u2019t make her pancakes anymore, fine, but this is not the way to have a successful marriage.

Don\u2019t add them to the batter - put the blueberries directly on the hot pan, let them cook a little bit, THEN pour the batter directly over the blueberries. \n\nThis ensures that the blueberries heat up and the pancake batter cooks evenly (cold blueberries make the batter surrounding the blueberries runny).", "Definitely not the asshole I\u2019ve been with my wife (read: fianc\u00e9 babymother) for 11 years and yeah I can hold a grudge and she can to the apology WAS needed a while ago.

I think is a Venus - Mars thing.\n\nWatch this [Jeff Allen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdE2Tvk812Y)", "YTA\n\nWhy not just divorce her because that will show her... \n\nDid you use Frozen blueberries?", "You are being petty. Let it go and move on. You are fixated on this and it will eventually destroy your relationship if you continue to allow this to fester.", "ESH\n\nHonestly man, 6 months in and you're holding a grudge over a childish reaction to the way some pancakes were made?   \nYour wife is a childish asshole, and you're a petty asshole.", "YTA. While prepping the pancakes your wife clearly communicated she was surprised and would not like the pancakes to have blueberries IN them. Instead of putting them to the side or batching them in two ways, you bulldozed right over her and made them your way. \n\nOnce cooked, huge surprise, she expressed her displeasure with the pancakes. \n\nFor real, why are you so hurt that she doesn\u2019t like your blueberry pancake? Your wife has a distaste for blueberries in food - so what\u2019s the big deal?\n\nYour huge overreaction here is honestly scary. I wonder how you would react if she actually criticized you for something, insta-divorce?", "ESH. Just talk to her for once, don\u2019t just do rude things for months hoping she\u2019ll understand.", "do you even like your wife?", "I was thinking they should just book the lawyer now, save the trouble.", "There is no way that two human adults act like this.", "If someone cooks for you, you never ever say it's a \"nastiest thing\". That's pretty hurtful. May be OP should clearly tell wife how it can be fixed from her end if apology is not acceptable. If he doesn't know that, then it's ESH.", "Finally found someone saying this! They are both assholes! Their communication with each other is non-existent! The wife sucks more than the guy here because that overreaction to the food is just insulting, and to not apologizesooner is ridiculous. But the fact that he could not just take a moment to sit down with her and explain that her behavior hurt him blows my mind. Instead, his solution is to stop cooking for her and wait for her to read his mind. Then he continues to be an ass after she attempted to make amends. They both seem very prideful,  and terrible at communicating. They either grow up or that marriage won't last.", "They have been married for six months and behaving this way for 2 of them.  A THIRD of their time after the wedding has been trying to outdo each other.\n\nSounds good to me!", "Yea they\u2019ll be divorced soon enough.", "I don't like having to ask for an apology because it seems performative.  I do all the cooking and I try to make what everybody likes. At least taste it.  If I get too many complaints I'll make some shit the way I like it which will feel like your asshole is on fire.  I wouldn't stop cooking for everybody but I'm also not playing games where you don't even taste it.", "Why does he have to bear the mental load of asking her for an apology ? \ud83e\uddd0", "Hey HEY HEY! I agree with you completely, but keep Tom Petty's name outta your mouth! LOL", "Technically, she did, just kinda aggressively.  He then proceeded to ignore what she said, and told her she'd like it.  She then had a tantrum over that.  And now he's having a tantrum, over her tantrum.  Sounds like a miserable relationship, and it almost sounds like they deserve each other.\n\n>My wife threw a weird sort of fit, asking me \"What the hell are you doing??\" very aggressively. I responded that I was making blueberry pancakes. She then informed me that the blueberries aren't supposed to go in the batter, but rather they're a topping.

She can very well search for that herself like how she find ways to hurt", "Yea idk how someone goes their entire life without seeing blueberries inside pancakes.", "What kind of BS is this? You Don\u2019t have be a trained cook to know you don\u2019t like blueberries cooked in your food. You\u2019re just as much of child as OP", "Okay. After rereading it, I'm not so sure now. He states he's the one primarily cooking. So presumably he's cooked while they dated and after they married. Furthermore he stated he's making blueberry pancakes. If she wanted them on the side, she should have said something BEFORE he added the blueberries to the batter. Plus she was the one who asked to be taught how to cook. Its rude to complain when someones teaching you how to cook and even ruder to not eat the food. Its just weird to me this was the first time she got angry over blueberries inside the pancakes, the only thing I could think of is this was literally the first time he cooked blueberry pancakes for her.", "if someone insulted my food that i made and GAGGED and said it was the most disgusting thing ever, i would not apologize. she clearly intended it to hurt his feelings \u2014 i don\u2019t get why you expect him to apologize first", "I dunno, everything you just said is textbook esh. I don't understand the Y T A vote personally.", "Well... I would argue that ESH. While yes, he is/was being a petty asshole, the wife also acted like a small child (seriously, it's one thing to actually try something and politely decline it, but to make such a dramatic act over it is just hurtful), and refused to apologize for literal months, which is objectively rude.", "She doesn't have to like blueberries IN baked goods, but she has a hell of a lot of nerve insulting him for putting blueberries IN the blueberry pancakes. If she wanted pancakes topped with blueberries, she should have asked for THAT. \n\nESH.  Communication is critical in a successful marriage. You two are off to a miserable start.", "Are you owed being cooked?", "He also needs to get over this and work on his communication. They're both being children. My kids are less bad at communicating than these two boofs.", "She waited two months. She's not sorry, she's sick of eating shitty food.", "She waited two months and obviously only apologized to get him to start cooking for her again. That apology was about as genuine as a politician's campaign promise to \"bring everyone together\".", "She nibbled literally 1 gram off the pancake, not even reaching any of the contentious blueberries. This wasn't about her liking/disliking it.", "Excellent point! \n\nIt's not as if he beat her up, he just decided not to share meals. My husband and I sometimes eat separately, and neither of us has starved. If she wants food from him, she better quit acting like the villain in a YA novel.", "I was wondering when I was going to see this comment. I agree; it would be different if roles were reversed based on Reddit history. You left out the \"Let him cook his own food!\" \ud83d\ude06 \ud83e\udd23", "And you are sexist.", "He had already put the blueberries in the batter. She wildly and childishly overreacted. So did he.", "my first thought was \u201cwhy wait?\u201d lmfao", "I wouldn\u2019t react this violently but I despise blueberries in pancakes so I would be annoyed if my hypothetical husband didn\u2019t even make like one without blueberries for me to eat. And then to not make food for her for 6 months holy shit he needs therapy.", "That theatrical fake gag? She KNOWS the behavior hurt him. That was the point of why she did it. She was punishing him for not obeying her. I really don't see what he has done wrong here. I think not cooking for someone who pretends to throw up when the food doesn't suit them is perfectly understandable. The only reason she apologized after all that time was likely because she got tired of eating her own subpar cooking.", "Maybe they were trying to say You Don\u2019t Know How it Feels\u2026", "lol ya I guess you\u2019re right. It\u2019s all terrible", "Because I think OP would benefit from asking himself what would soothe his feelings? From the post, it didn't seem like he had any idea, so I was wondering if he'd be able to think of something. Self-reflection isn't unreasonable to prompt.", "Yeah, she didn't say \"I don't like blueberries cooked into my pancakes. She said \"What the hell are you doing?\" This means she doesn't know that that's a normal thing. It's one thing to not prefer something and communicate it. It's quite another to act as if the person cooking your meal doesn't know what they're doing and the food they cooked was disgusting. \n\nYou are welcome to disagree and feel free to throw insults around simply because you don't agree with me.", "She doesn't have to like blueberries cooked in her food. She does have to acknowledge that blueberries cooked in the batter are an integral part of blueberry pancakes, unless she wants to sound like an idiot.", "She apologized. What more does he want from her?", "Only she told him while he was prepping the pancakes it was not what she wanted. OP just shat on her request. That\u2019s why she reacted at the table, not to insult his cooking.", "She still put in the effort to say sorry. That makes her the bigger person NOW", "I went on strike once too years ago.  Sometimes this is the only way for someone to understand your value.  I'm worried about it taking two months for her to apologize. I think you should drop it and make enough for both of you but if it were me it would be a while before I catered to my wife if she behaved this way.  Make what you want and she can either eat it or not but make enough for both of you.", "You could\u2019ve easily left the blueberries out and made some without but with a topping like she communicated to you was her preference. People\u2019s brains have an effect on their taste. Ever expect something sour and get something sweet? It\u2019s off putting. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s bad it just wasn\u2019t what you expected. She had it in her head that the blueberries do not belong in the batter. Make both and then prove her wrong. \n\nBut seriously you guys need to learn to communicate better. Like now. It\u2019s like jr high students at the moment. Do better or divorce.", "Grow up. She doesn\u2019t have to eat something she doesn\u2019t like. She apologized. Move on. What are you 2?  You are behaving worse than my teens.", "People know what they like to eat! She clearly dislikes cooked blueberries in pancakes and made it clear to you before they were cooked. You continued doing it anyways. And your surprised she didn\u2019t like it. You\u2019re not some Michelin star chef, not gods gift to the kitchen. Get over yourself", "Yes, this is annoying. She overreacted. She also acknowledged it and apologized.\n\nBut let me ask you: what do you want your marriage to look like? Do you want it to be like it is now until it ends in a bitter divorce? What is your ideal resolution? \n\n6 months of holding a grudge has surely already had a negative impact on your marriage. Either you accept her apology and move on, or it will get worse.\n\nDo you really want to explain to everyone that you got a divorce because of pancakes?", "It\u2019s fine for her to be grossed out just by the idea of blueberries in pancakes.", "> I asked if my wife wanted blueberry pancakes for breakfast. **She agreed**\n\nTypically people who despise blueberries in pancakes probably don't agree to have someone make them blueberry pancakes.", "Passive aggressiveness is never appropriate. Both are big babies.", "What did he do? In the midst of cooking, it seems like she made it pretty clear she didn\u2019t want pancakes made that way. OP\u2019s response was more or less \u201cyou\u2019re wrong, let me show you how this is done babe.\u201d\n\nThe wife wasn\u2019t punishing him, she was angry because OP showed he doesn\u2019t give a fuck what his wife wants. And if OP reacts like this over a pancake tif I can imagine he rarely shows that he cares about his wife\u2019s feelings.", "They\u2019re free fallin\u2019 into divorce", "Her reaction was absurd and over the top and I'd still be salty over it. Especially if it took TWO months for that apology to come. Was it even sincere? Or did she simply say what he wanted to hear just so she can eat his food again? Those are my problems with her side.", "Two months later when she was sick of cooking for herself? How is that a real apology?", "He had already put the blueberries in the batter. Was he supposed to pick them out one by one?\n\nESH.", "He said he was making blueberry pancakes, did she want that for breakfast. She said yes. During the prep, it became obvious that she DID NOT KNOW WHAT BLUEBERRY PANCAKES WERE. He continued making them instead of throwing the blueberry pancake batter away.   If she wanted plain pancakes, she SHOULD have mentioned that BEFORE the blueberries were added. She didn't, because she was raised by wolves and didn't understand what blueberry pancakes were. \n\nShe was also offered bacon, eggs, and oj for breakfast. \n\nThey are both AH's. Their marriage seems doomed.", "I really think these are just two almost equally shitty people. An apology after two months shouldn't really count. It feels like they were both playing a game of chicken to see who would crack first. The wife 'lost' and apologized, but really the only loser is their relationship. They need to learn some proper communication techniques.", "Wifey only complained about the blueberries going into the pancake batter after they were already added in.", "Sexist like you makes me sick \ud83e\udd22", "What makes you think she ever tried them? She didn't know people put blueberries in pancakes.", "You are being sexist, please work on yourself .", "But she is wrong, that is how you make blueberry pancakes.", "Then maybe she can cook her own goddamn food. I really don't understand why this sub despise men.", "Got it, it\u2019s her way or the highway. Grow up.", "iirc the bluebs were already in the batter! and she didn't even try it, knowing her hubs cooks well and she wouldnt have a clue how to do it herself", "She didn't say she didn't want blueberries, she thought they were supposed to be made a different way and was upset that he was making them \"wrong\".", "I understand and agree that her reaction was not cool. But what can she do now to make amends? How can they move forward?", "I mean I can\u2019t teleport to their kitchen, but in my minds eye he dumped them in and wife said at that moment \u201cwhat the hell are you doing?\u201d and said what she was expecting. At that moment, it\u2019s pretty easy to make some with blueberries and some without before you\u2019ve gone ahead and mixed it all up.\n\nOr he could have said \u201coh I didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what you expected, sorry they\u2019re already dumped in.\u201d\n\nAlmost anything is better than making her feel dumb and saying that\u2019s how blueberry pancakes are made, you\u2019ll love it.\n\nYou have to put yourself in the wife\u2019s shoes. Assuming she\u2019s a half way normal human, seems she was mad at OP; and not simply because of how she likes her blueberries.", "I agree their marriage is doomed.\n\nBut not knowing what blueberry pancakes are, or simply having a misunderstanding about what he was going to make, does not make her an asshole. \n\nWhat do you think she was mad about? Just a disagreement in the right way to prep a pancake? Not sure that really adds up especially since he usually does the cooking. She was pissed off about something.", "Yea they\u2019re both shitty people but the fact is she apologized. Even if it was for selfish purposes, it is a step forward to fixing things. He is holding them back from it", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "There is no right or wrong when it comes to personal food preference.

She wasn\u2019t asking him to cut off a finger.", "What do you think she was mad about? A story only makes sense if it can be explained from both perspectives.", "I dunno. I'd need time personally. He's obviously pretty proud of his cooking skills and she basically just shit on him. If I was in his situation, if she had apologized the day after, no harm no fowl. But two months. I'd need time to get over it as well. That was incredibly rude of her.", "And she remained pissed off, refusing to apologize for two months. That was her asshole move. \n\nHer \"misunderstanding\" about breakfast was 100% her fault. He was clear, she agreed without asking for clarification, then yelled at him for making the blueberry pancakes incorrectly.  She was totally in the wrong for that. Then she acted like a two year old and used horrendous grammar to insult the finished product.", "I think we disagree with how the situation actually played out, which makes it easy to assign blame differently."]}
