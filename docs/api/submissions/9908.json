Maybe, but in all honesty it took her two solid effing months to apologize for being a disrespectful asshole to ludicrous degrees. She practically spat out your food, declared it the nastiest thing she'd ever eaten(which I doubt) and huffed about it. This from a woman who is too fundamentally incapable to do basic fucking cooking. Fuck that. Were the genders swapped people would be absolutely dunking on her.\n\nHowever, at this point it's not even really about the pancakes, it's as they say around here, \"not about the iranian yogurt\" it's the principle of the matter. The bare basic respect for effort given, and the general lack of anything even approaching humility from her.

She probably should be doing more in terms of helping with cooking so maybe that's a compromise.", "ESH. 2 months and you've only been cooking for yourself? Are you kidding me? Did you even ask if she has texture issues (i.e. sensory integration.) Did you ask her why she reacted this way? I keep going back to your ages thinking there must be a typo. \n\nBoth of you need to learn to communicate. I'm not one to say get out, but if it's not too late you should annul the marriage or if it is too late, talk to a lawyer about a divorce. Therapy if for some reason you feel the need to stay together. But if that's they case why would you want to be in such an unhealthy relationship? Petty is one thing, but this is not how you act if you care and love someone, especially your spouse.\n\nAnd for the future since you appear utterly clueless: kids won't like or eat a lot of what you make, no matter how good your kitchen skills might be. It's the food, color, texture, their mood, the weather.

And not just because you refused to let it go, OP.\n\nYour wife said yes to blueberry pancakes.

That she was literally expecting pancakes with fresh fruit on top? At the very least, did her very aggressive response not even give you pause to consider that maybe, just maybe, you two had a *miscommunication*? Apparently not.\n\nI know many people who have very strong feelings about certain fruits being cooked (meaning, they won't eat them when they're cooked, even if it's just into a pancake).  They wouldn't touch a blueberry pancake like you made with a ten foot pole.\n\nWhat your wife did was rude, sure, but you don't seem to think you did *anything* wrong before her little performance. Maybe instead of assuming her ignorance was the issue, you could've just *asked* her if her expectation of \"blueberry pancakes\" was truly regular pancakes with blueberries on top.\n\nWhy did she wait two months to apologize? Hmm, I wonder. Have you even spoken with her about this? Or did you just pettily wait for an apology all this time?", "ESH\n\nShe made it clear she was expecting blueberries *on* the pancakes, not inside them.\n\nYou completely ignored her, and even went so far as to insist that she would love the pancakes your way.  She did not.  It never occurred to you that you might be in the wrong, and that *you* could also broach the subject and apologize.  You\u2019re an AH.\n\nYou\u2019re also a petty AH for refusing to cook for her for months and leaving her to microwaved meals over this.  She went from wanting to learn to cook from you to eating microwaved trash.\n\nShe is a grown woman and didn\u2019t need to gag at the table.

I 100% agree with you taking a stand, she was rude, unappreciative, and just downright an asshole.....but are you really going to go the rest of your married life without cooking for her again?

I hate how sexist this sub is. Had a woman not taken advice on her way of cooking from her non cooking husband and he reacted that way to her cooking it would be a huge issue. He\u2019s not wrong for not cooking for her and she was out of line. The fact that she didn\u2019t apologize for 2 months is also a huge issue.

If she was actually sorry for what she did she could have said something sooner, it sounds more like she's fed up of microwave meals at this point.   \nShe could have also spoken to you about not liking blueberries cooked like that, instead she threw a fit and acted as though that was totally fine.", "ESH- neither of you sound mature enough to legitimately be married.  \n\nYour wife threw a straight up tantrum over pancakes and acted like a toddler in tasting them.

Especially considering that it took her over two months to apologize for her shitty behavior, there really is no excuse for her, whether she liked your pancakes or not. \n\nYou, however, are just as bad. You went out of your way to be petty and perpetuate this drama for MONTHS instead of just being an adult and communicating your feelings. On top of that, when you did finally get the apology you so desperately wanted, despite both of your absolutely insane insistence on acting like children by refusing to use your big boy words, you continue to perpetuate this drama and drive a wedge even further between you and your supposed \u201cpartner\u201d. \n\nMarriage and commitment is meant to be a partnership. This means building each other up in love, kindness, and forgiveness. You should be best friends who always want to see the best for each other, and who are willing to admit when you\u2019re wrong and apologize to each other. Instead you two are out here tearing each other down and holding onto petty little hurts to the point where they\u2019re blowing up into huge, potentially marriage ending, issues. What\u2019s the point of being married if y\u2019all are gonna do this shit??? \n\nYou both need to grow the fuck up and learn how to communicate like adults. You\u2019re married and building a life together, not every little issue needs to turn into some big high school drama. All relationships have a give and take, and no one can be perfect all the time. You both need to learn to admit when you\u2019re wrong, and apologize to each other instead of letting situations fester this way. If you don\u2019t want to do that, well, I\u2019d just file for divorce now because your marriage is going to turn into even more of a toxic shitshow than it already is.", "W\"hat is required for you to move on? An apology is not enough for you (and that is fine), she can't turn back time an apologise 2 months ago so what do you need? If you can't answer that, then she surely can't. Is that it? You never cook again for her? I say NTA but you could be if you don't have a plan for eventually moving on (or out).", "NTA. you're doing the thing most people hate doing in a marriage/relationship (cooking) and then she complains about it. I mean hello!?!\n\nAnd yes you shouldn't have to ask for an apology for something so obvious. It took her two months because she knew she was wrong but was being stubborn.\n\nObviously there should be communication in a relationship but in this case it's obvious, she's the AH.", "ESH. Y'all need to work on your communication or inane petty shit like this is going to nuke your relationship. Was your wife dramatic and immature in her response? Yes. Should she have apologized sooner? Yes. Should you have told her you were hurt by her reaction instead of giving her the silent treatment? Yes. \n\nPlaying games with eachother's emotions is going to get exhausting quick. I learned early on in my relationships that when I ignored my partner's preferences (things like \"I don't like blueberries in my pancakes\") and waved them off and just being overdramatic, that would just invited disappointment on their end and frustration on mine. *It's easier to just listen to them the first time.* Wife doesn't want blueberries? No worries. Separate the batter and make yours with blueberries, hers without. Takes an extra 10 seconds to separate the batter and everyone gets what they want.  \n\nInstead of pushing forward and ignoring their preference, if I want to coax them into trying something new, I communicate why it's delicious and ask if they'd want to try it. Half the time they say yes, or try a bite of mine when we eat so they can know whether they want it that way next time. It's not hard to be understanding and to listen. At the end of the day it comes down to this -- Where do you want to put your energy? Right now, both of y'all sound exhausting.", "NTA bro. Run. This is only 6 months in and trust me it'll get worse", "Passive aggression for such sustained period. She was rude but you have been speaking your anger through your actions for a long time.

Now decide to get the fuck over it.", "NTA. Talk about over reacting. My partner tends to cook for me whilst I wash up, because he\u2019s more confident in the kitchen than me.

Immature, unappreciative and petty.", "NTA\n\nShe childish....", "NTA\n\nYeah reverse the roles and all these ,\"you have to communicate\" ESH ppl would be screaming bloody murder for his treatment of his wife.", "I really feel like this is not about the blueberry pancakes.\n\nHow is the rest of your relationship? Is this sort of rude outburst - extreme passive aggressive response a common thing?\n\nShe was very rude. I would be hurt too. But months is a very long time to not sort this out like adults.", "NTA. She was very rude, condescending about a topic she knows nothing about by her own admission, then doubled down on being rude only to prove she wasn't wrong. When she obviously was. I'm embarrassed for her.\n\nYour reaction is warranted, not an asshole, BUT it's not productive for your marriage.

If you're still upset, you both need to talk things out, and honestly, you both should've talked 2 months ago. Don't get me wrong, she should've spoken to you instead of acting that way about the food in the first place, but also, you've now spent two months building walls between you and her, instead of addressing the actual problem. I'm gonna guess you didn't have siblings growing up to figure this out with, but you need to be open and honest about how this felt, and then you need to be open to giving her a chance again. You don't have to cook every meal, but you probably need to plan that out.\n\nAlso, now she's likely going to think she can't give her opinion at all, so you two should probably just talk about how to go about that now in a way that is kind and considerate of both of you.", "ESH\n\nIf she didn't like it, she should have just been poilte about it & not hurtful & she should have apologized sooner, sincerely \n\nIf it hurt you, you should have said so & communicated.

As the main cook in my family, if my husband tells me he doesn't like something, I don't try to force him to eat it.

I\u2019m not saying she wasn\u2019t dramatic but some people really find warm fruit gross.\n\nIf she wanted it as a topping, you should have made her a couple plain pancakes before you added the blueberries.\n\nHer reaction was dramatic but your petty refusal to cook for her for *months* and even continuing now after an apology is absolutely insane.\n\nESH. Y\u2019all don\u2019t sound ready to be married if it takes *months* for you to attempt to solve an issue.", "ESH- you both should just get the divorce papers ready", "You are both being petty and immature.

You then,sir, doubled down and quit cooking for her almost completely?! You don\u2019t stop doing basic things for your mate because your feelings are slightly hurt. I might think about some preventative maintenance and get some counseling. Good luck.", "ESH.  Both of you need to grow up.", "ESH - Like come one now.\nThere is no way you don't see how foolish this is right?\n\nShe freaked out because blueberries were going into the pancakes. Instead of asking why are you putting blueberries in the batter. If she never had the berries in batter, she must be looking at you like why are you trying to ruin her food. But she should of asked for a plain pancake when she noticed what you were doing. But you should of also noticed. That maybe she didn't like her pancakes like that.\n\nShe then was dramatic about the meal and rejected it without even fully trying it. Once again not cool. Dramatic and childish on her part. You decide to not cook for her for two months. And don't say anything to her. Not explaining why and how she hurt your feelings. That's childish on your end too. \n\nNow she is finally trying to make amends in this weird stubborn feud you guys are having. And instead of trying to meet her in the middle.

You get angrier that it took her so long to apologize.\n\nLike wouldn't it be better at this point to just sit her down and say this is how you made me feel and by waiting so long to apologize I feel like you don't respect me. So I will continue not cooking for you, but I would like to do something to help repair our relationship. Then you two talk about what that could be. Like maybe you teach her a few simple things to make for herself. Then maybe you know cooking for herself, like actually cooking and not frozen meals. Would teach her to appreciate the process.\n\n (Tho personally I HATE blueberries in my pancakes as well.

Why not apologise sooner?
