If she doesn\u2019t want to treat you the respect as her mother, then you can\u2019t be expected to treat her like a daughter. If you still want to send her something, it might be a kind gesture but an unnecessary one.", "NTA. By 30 you shouldn\u2019t expect birthday gifts anymore. If she treated you well and you wanted to give her a gift, that would totally be up to you, but she doesn\u2019t and you don\u2019t want to, so don\u2019t! Simple as that. She\u2019s not entitled to gifts and certainly shouldn\u2019t be expecting them at this point, especially if your relationship is bad,", "NTA. I think that's a reasonable response to not get her one. She's pretty clearly severed that tie between you.", "NTA. Count the last decade of free babysitting, free food, and free housekeeping service as her birthday present for the next decade or so. If she mentions it, tell her the above.", "YWNBTA, and I don\u2019t think you should get her anything anyway. Time for her to grow up and take care of herself and her poor kids.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t treat you like family. She wouldn\u2019t return the sentiment on your birthday, I suspect.", "YWNBTA - She\u2019s 30 and an adult.  She doesn\u2019t get to treat people badly and still expect a birthday celebration.", "Oh dear, your daughter sounds incredibly awful. I don\u2019t think a present would make a difference or mend your relationship. You\u2019ve already done so much to support her; at this point, it sounds like she\u2019s made her bed\u2026I\u2019m sorry OP, I can\u2019t imagine how hard this must be for you. NTA", "NTA. You owe her nothing.", "Nta, it\u2019s natural as a mother to feel like that, my mum disowned my sister and kicked her out of the house as she was horrible to my mum, but my mum still calls/texts her sometimes or gives her money for things despite them not liking each other. However in my case my sister is 18, so my mum babies her still, ur daughter is an adult who knows better, u wudnt be the AH for not getting her anything", "NTA. I would simply send a card. Don\u2019t write in it and don\u2019t include anything. Yes, she is still your daughter, but she made her bed and she\u2019s gotta sleep in it.  But please keep tabs on those poor kids.", "NTA.  But for the sake of your grandkids, I'd mail her a card.  You don't have to say anything buy Happy Birthday in it.  She's going to bitch either way, but at least you'll have the moral high ground since you acknowledged her birthday in a perfectly appropriate way.", "I am totally between NTA and...  YTA...  yet: \n\nShe seems already troubled, maybe depressed etc. acting in spite and vengeance (usually people who are extremely frustrated/overwhelmed with their own lives project such behaviour on others, and it's always easier to do it to the closest person you have)... and she will be spending her 30th birthday alone... I feel this will only add up to the already existing bad blood and create more distance... \n\nIf you are conflicted, just do it... worst case scenario she will not appreciated it, but you will have your heart at peace you tried to be the bigger person. \n\nBest case scenario, she will appreciate your kindness towards her, even though she (hopefully knows) she doesn't deserve it...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You will be opening old wounds, new wounds, fresh wounds and stale wounds if you insist on recognizing her birthday when you know in your heart she has no desire to hear from you. It's not a loving gesture when you know that she does not want contact. She would not sit in the same room with you. Leave her be. You won. You get to see your grandchildren. Let her sulk in silence.", "NTA,  but ... you also don't want your daughter poisoning your grandchildren's minds against you, either. So, send a card and maybe even gift her something cheap, so the children see that you are not the one instigating problems.\n\nWhat a horror story you are living through.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t deserve a present. If she spends her birthday alone, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault but her own. Maybe one day she will make changes but until she does I would just love your grandkids and know you are doing the right thing."]}
