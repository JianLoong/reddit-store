Her mom is crazy and her dad's family wants nothing to do with her so she was raised by her grandparents. When she was 16 her grandparents moved into assisted living and her dad's family bought her a house maybe 15 minutes from us. This kid's house is huge. It's 5 bedrooms, 7 baths, close to 4,000 square feet, and has an amazing backyard. They bought her a car and pay for her college and she gets a monthly allowance from them that covers all of her expenses, plus a few hundred every month.\n\nShe didn't want to live alone so she asked if we (me, wife, and 2 kids, 2 and 4f) wanted to move in, rent free. My wife wanted to say yes but I didn't want the extra 15 minute commute. We argued for months over this because the house is in a better school district and not renting could save us a lot of money but it's not like we're struggling financially. We're probably going to buy a house next year. My wife and kids still spent/spend hours every day at that house and she gave her niece a key to our house.\n\nMy wife's/her niece's family is a shitshow. My wife doesn't speak to most of them but her niece does. Last week her niece showed up after a particularly stressful family dinner and my wife kept giving her wine while she ranted about how horrible the family is. Soon enough an entire bottle was gone and my wife's niece was too drunk to drive herself home. My wife said she was going to drive her niece home, make sure she's okay, and uber home. After being at the niece's house for maybe a half hour, she texted again and said she was going to spend the night. I tried to remind her that she has a family here that she has to think of but she said she can't leave her niece alone right now and said that she would've been able to take care of her niece and her kids if I would've agreed to move in with her niece.\n\nShe ended up not coming home until noon the next day, leaving me to take care of the kids all morning. I said she was being selfish and she has to think of her family and not just her niece but my wife thinks I'm heartless for expecting her \"barely 18\" (she turned 18 4 months ago) niece to deal with everything alone.\n\nAITA for saying my wife needs to think of her family and not just her niece.", "created_utc": 1677550322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11du0x7/aita_for_saying_my_wife_has_to_think_of_her/", "score": 193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was a minor and you couldn't find yourself to be inconvenienced 15 minutes a day in driving time to help a FAMILY MEMBER out? How disgusting. Your poor wife.", "YTA for now but info about what exactly your niece has done for you to resent her could change the verdict to a ESH. What do you mean by shitshow? Is the example you gave of her downing an entire bottle of wine supposed to be an example of a shitshow? If it is, it doesn't sound like something any normal person would refer to as a \"shitshow\" and it just seems like you hate your niece unjustifiably. You hate your niece enough to the point where you'd avoid bettering the lives of your children by moving to a better school district, why? What is it about your niece you hate so much that you'd forego making no-brainer decisions just to avoid?", "YTA.  Are you not capable of caring for your children?  You are happy to deny your family a rent free existence because it would add a whole 15 minutes to your commute.  You are a huge controlling AH.", "You are the idiot. I'm going to say it this way, you have the opportunity to show an 18 year old girl a lot of love and kindness and guide her in a loving and constructive way. You have the opportunity to show your own children that taking care of others can be rewarding. Instead you decide because she's 18 that she's not worth trying to help out. I hope you get the wakeup call and realize kindness will get you a lot farther than selfishness. You have the opportunity of a lifetime for a rent free life and a better education for your children. Please reconsider before making stupid decisions.", "YTA, your wife has only thought of her family in this story.\n\nShe thought about what was best for the kids education.

Did you get stuck babysitting your own kids for a morning?   Heaven forbid!\n\nYour wife is allowed to care about her niece and even help her out sometimes.  Your wife is allowed to be upset that your concern over an extra 15 minutes of drive time is preventing you from saving considerably more for your own house, and for wanting her child who is nearly school age to be in a better school district (which, by the way, IS thinking about her own family, something you apparently didn't find necessary in that case.)\n\nIn case it's not obvious, YTA.", "YTA. A lot of people might say that you\u2019re not, but moving in with the niece will help you save more for a better house and give her company as well. And looking after your own kids overnight is not the end of the world.", "YTA. You\u2019re willing to sacrifice your children\u2019s education because of an extra 15 minute drive. Also you would get into your own house faster by saving rent while living in a spacious house for free with better schools.

Your wife cares about this girl, but you don't, and just like her father's family, you don't want anything to do with her.  Now, she may be a hot mess, and we aren't obligated to make room in our lives for everyone with a sob story, so not wanting to deal with her or the drama does not per se make you TAH, because we all have our limits.  I can understand your not wanting to move in, because that is a 24/7/365 obligation, and it would be a lot harder for you to set boundaries about what YOU are willing to do / tolerate.\n\nBut, not only do you not want to make room in your own life, it seems like you're jealous of your wife, who DOES want to (and maybe needs to) make room in HER life for this girl. They each understand the trauma of growing up in that family, and they may really need each other.  But this isn't all about avoiding drama, because you're quite willing to create drama in your own family to get what you want, by trying to manipulate your wife and make her feel guilty for \"not thinking of her family\" when she spent one evening taking care of her niece.  She is not the selfish person in this relationship at this point.  Your wife is not an extension of you.  She has the right to spend time with people other than you and your children, and you can take care of / keep an eye on the kids once in a while.
