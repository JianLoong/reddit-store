Her mom is crazy and her dad's family wants nothing to do with her so she was raised by her grandparents. When she was 16 her grandparents moved into assisted living and her dad's family bought her a house maybe 15 minutes from us. This kid's house is huge. It's 5 bedrooms, 7 baths, close to 4,000 square feet, and has an amazing backyard. They bought her a car and pay for her college and she gets a monthly allowance from them that covers all of her expenses, plus a few hundred every month.\n\nShe didn't want to live alone so she asked if we (me, wife, and 2 kids, 2 and 4f) wanted to move in, rent free. My wife wanted to say yes but I didn't want the extra 15 minute commute. We argued for months over this because the house is in a better school district and not renting could save us a lot of money but it's not like we're struggling financially. We're probably going to buy a house next year. My wife and kids still spent/spend hours every day at that house and she gave her niece a key to our house.\n\nMy wife's/her niece's family is a shitshow. My wife doesn't speak to most of them but her niece does. Last week her niece showed up after a particularly stressful family dinner and my wife kept giving her wine while she ranted about how horrible the family is. Soon enough an entire bottle was gone and my wife's niece was too drunk to drive herself home. My wife said she was going to drive her niece home, make sure she's okay, and uber home. After being at the niece's house for maybe a half hour, she texted again and said she was going to spend the night. I tried to remind her that she has a family here that she has to think of but she said she can't leave her niece alone right now and said that she would've been able to take care of her niece and her kids if I would've agreed to move in with her niece.\n\nShe ended up not coming home until noon the next day, leaving me to take care of the kids all morning. I said she was being selfish and she has to think of her family and not just her niece but my wife thinks I'm heartless for expecting her \"barely 18\" (she turned 18 4 months ago) niece to deal with everything alone.\n\nAITA for saying my wife needs to think of her family and not just her niece.", "created_utc": 1677550322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11du0x7/aita_for_saying_my_wife_has_to_think_of_her/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was a minor and you couldn't find yourself to be inconvenienced 15 minutes a day in driving time to help a FAMILY MEMBER out? How disgusting. Your poor wife.", "YTA for now but info about what exactly your niece has done for you to resent her could change the verdict to a ESH. What do you mean by shitshow? Is the example you gave of her downing an entire bottle of wine supposed to be an example of a shitshow? If it is, it doesn't sound like something any normal person would refer to as a \"shitshow\" and it just seems like you hate your niece unjustifiably. You hate your niece enough to the point where you'd avoid bettering the lives of your children by moving to a better school district, why? What is it about your niece you hate so much that you'd forego making no-brainer decisions just to avoid?", "YTA.  Are you not capable of caring for your children?  You are happy to deny your family a rent free existence because it would add a whole 15 minutes to your commute.  You are a huge controlling AH.", "You are the idiot. I'm going to say it this way, you have the opportunity to show an 18 year old girl a lot of love and kindness and guide her in a loving and constructive way. You have the opportunity to show your own children that taking care of others can be rewarding. Instead you decide because she's 18 that she's not worth trying to help out. I hope you get the wakeup call and realize kindness will get you a lot farther than selfishness. You have the opportunity of a lifetime for a rent free life and a better education for your children. Please reconsider before making stupid decisions.", "YTA, your wife has only thought of her family in this story.\n\nShe thought about what was best for the kids education.

Did you get stuck babysitting your own kids for a morning?   Heaven forbid!\n\nYour wife is allowed to care about her niece and even help her out sometimes.  Your wife is allowed to be upset that your concern over an extra 15 minutes of drive time is preventing you from saving considerably more for your own house, and for wanting her child who is nearly school age to be in a better school district (which, by the way, IS thinking about her own family, something you apparently didn't find necessary in that case.)\n\nIn case it's not obvious, YTA.", "YTA. A lot of people might say that you\u2019re not, but moving in with the niece will help you save more for a better house and give her company as well. And looking after your own kids overnight is not the end of the world.", "YTA. You\u2019re willing to sacrifice your children\u2019s education because of an extra 15 minute drive. Also you would get into your own house faster by saving rent while living in a spacious house for free with better schools.

Your wife cares about this girl, but you don't, and just like her father's family, you don't want anything to do with her.  Now, she may be a hot mess, and we aren't obligated to make room in our lives for everyone with a sob story, so not wanting to deal with her or the drama does not per se make you TAH, because we all have our limits.  I can understand your not wanting to move in, because that is a 24/7/365 obligation, and it would be a lot harder for you to set boundaries about what YOU are willing to do / tolerate.\n\nBut, not only do you not want to make room in your own life, it seems like you're jealous of your wife, who DOES want to (and maybe needs to) make room in HER life for this girl. They each understand the trauma of growing up in that family, and they may really need each other.  But this isn't all about avoiding drama, because you're quite willing to create drama in your own family to get what you want, by trying to manipulate your wife and make her feel guilty for \"not thinking of her family\" when she spent one evening taking care of her niece.  She is not the selfish person in this relationship at this point.  Your wife is not an extension of you.  She has the right to spend time with people other than you and your children, and you can take care of / keep an eye on the kids once in a while.

I don't see why your wife should ignore her niece as well.", "YTA. I would DREAM of a rent-free superb home.\n\n15 minutes more? Please tell the truth. You didn't want your wife to care for anyone else than YOU (and maybe your kids). What a gigantic enormous egoistical asshole!", "YTA", "15 extra minutes for RENT FREE AND BETTER SCHOOLS!?! And your reaction to this?? And you had to parent your children for a whole flippin morning!?! Oh, the horror. \n\nYou do realize your wife is most likely reconsidering you right now, right? She has an out 15 minutes away with better schools. \n\nYTA. Stop being so selfish and controlling and immature.", "YTA\n \nYou're complaining that you had to take care of your children for the night. BFD.", "YTA You are very selfish.", "Oh my god you had to take care of your kids all morning? Was there no other woman there to help you? You poor thing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.", "YTA everything you said was about you, you, you. Selfish, controlling thinking only of yourself. You wanted your wife back to do all the work. I hope she moves in with niece permanently and drops you. I hope she can start to see what an AH you are.", "YTA. Nothing else needed, you made it an easy decision", "YTA. You are not willing to give your family a better chance at education, a better school, all because of a 15 minute commute for you. \n\nYou don\u2019t think that it would be a good opportunity to save money for your own house?\n\nOh no, you had to look after your own children all morning? Have you never done that before in the whole 4 years? That\u2019s poor. Has your wife never had time for herself while you looked after the kids? \n\nYou are the one not thinking about your family, you only think about yourself, and if you\u2019re not careful, she might move without you. \n\nAre you afraid that her niece will see what a terrible husband you are? Or that you have to pretend to be a better husband than you actually are? Can\u2019t let anyone but your wife know what a narcissist you are.", "YTA. Being forced to parent your own children for a morning doesn\u2019t make you the victim. Honestly it doesn\u2019t even matter that she\u2019s your wives niece, she could be a friend, and she would still be justified in spending time with her and taking care of her. You\u2019re extremely selfish for denying your family a fantastic living situation what would benefit everyone just because you don\u2019t want to drive an extra 15 minutes, and your pride would apparently be bruised by living there.", "Everything your wife does is think about family, raising children, taking care of her niece, fighting to get ger kids into better schools.\n\nAll you do is avoid taking care of family - selling out your kids' future for 15 minutes less commute, getting upset when you have to take care of them for half a day, letting a 16 yo niece live by herself and in general doing anything to ignore her and make your wife ignore her too.\n\nYou are in no position to tell your wife to 'think of family'. You don't even know what it means. I think you think it means 'ignore all family members and think only about me and my needs'. You don't hold a candle to her and think you can tell her how to be.\n\nYou are so the AH, and a sorry excuse for a partner, father or uncle. Hopefully your wife realizes that and gets divorced and move into her niece's house, where she can think of family without you getting in the way - make sure her kids get the best education possible and her niece is taken care of. And you can buy a house next to your workplace where you can think about 'family' - yourself, yourself and yourself - all you want.", "Are you trolling? Because anyone that's supposedly saving for a house and given the option of staying in a house for free with no rent and is so bad at math that they turn that down is a bit of a AH. \n\nYour wife has known her neice longer than she's known you, and she's 18. Free housing and a potential extra pair of hands with the kids and better school district. And you are turning this all down over 15 minutes extra commute? \n\nYTA.", "So....you clearly don't like your wife's niece....also you are very controlling YTA", "\u201cI\u2019m too prideful to accept help that would put my children in a better school and my family in a better financial situation.\u201d \n\nI have a hard time believing this one is real, but if it is, YTA.", "I got hung up on the 15 minutes commute. I know commutes suck, and that's 2.5 hours a week, and a handful of days of extra driving per year.\n\nI would have wanted more info about whether she owns her house or the family does; that would affect my decision to live there. But not the 15 minutes commute, at least not enough to argue about it for months.\n\nIf 15 minutes commute is your only reasoning, YTA. Do you not like the neice? Are you jealous of her free house? She's paying for it with no parents. I'm sure your kids would rather have their parents than a house.", "YTA: your Wife should leave you and go live with her niece, god forbid you have to take care of the kids you helped make\ud83d\ude44", "NTA because it seems that the niece's personal life is volatile and it's not appropriate to place your children in that kind of environment. And your wife shouldn't be plying her niece with alcohol especially if the children are present. Living rent free in a good school district may sound good on paper but instead of paying money for your rent, you will be paying with your peace of mind", "She even thought about what was best for the niece. He made a /r/AITA post about it.", "At least his wife has a lovely house to move into when she dumps his ass", "I think ultimately wife is going to drop the OP, YTA OP", "There is no such thing as babysitting one's own kids. Babysitting is the definition if one is watching someone else's kids.  Parenting is the term used when watching one's own kids. OP was upset they had to parent their own kids they made for one night, which is absolutely ridiculous. If someone can't parent for one night they shouldn't have made the kids in the first place.", "I said **possibly** underage. That still doesn't change the fact that wife sat there and watched her emotionally fragile niece get drunk. The girl that needs support and guidance that the wife supposedly wants to provide. Wife is using her niece.", "Well I mean your wife could divorce you and then she and the kids can move in with your niece...\n\nYou are a grown ass adult.  You can tale care of your kids for a few days on your own", "RANDOM?!?! You seriously said \"a random 16y/o girl.\" She's family!\nBut then, apparently you can barely be expected to take care of YOUR OWN kids. Ewww! You are the WORST kind of YTA. I hope your wife takes the kids and moves in with her niece.", "She\u2019s a sixteen year old who has a house and someone else providing for her. You don\u2019t have to take care of her, she\u2019s obviously been doing it herself. It\u2019s a house and she\u2019s not random", "\u201cRandom?!\u201d  I have a niece who was being raised by craptastic parents in an unsafe house.  When she was 13, I got custody, moved her in with my 3 y.o. and me, and raised her.  She wasn\u2019t a random teenager\u2014she was a close family member who needed a stable home environment.  It\u2019s what you do when someone needs help.", "Look at it this way - your whole family can live rent free at her house, or your wife and kids can live rent free and you can pay to rent a 1br apartment and see your kids every other weekend. But hey, you'll save on your commute!"]}
