My hub asked his sis to come ( lives in a diff city) & help take care of our other 2 kids while we go to have our bb when the time comes. I was appreciative of this when he told me she was coming as this wasn\u2019t supposed to be long term. I assumed 2-3 weeks. \n\nNext thing I know my hub is telling me she will be here for 3 mths after we have already agreed she come up. I\u2019m not very happy about this as I don\u2019t want a full time visitor for that long with our new bb, I voice my concerns But we can\u2019t do anything about it now as she is already coming .. She shows up and is great at first , but now her daughter (12) who lives full time in the same city as us with her dad is also staying with us. \n\nThis was never part of the agreement or plan at any point. So now our houshold has doubled chaos while we prep for bb & while we are deep in Reno\u2019s - we only have 1 bathrm rn that is right next to our room, so everytime someone comes up the stairs to use it, our dogs bark or someone gets woken up. This is obvs annoying wo the 2 extra people here, but on top of being woken up multiple times a night now we have two school aged lo\u2019s trying to get ready in the am & this was never ran by me. \n\nMy hub also told his sis that she will be taking over all school drop & pick ups for our son wo letting me know (I am a sahm) they have been in constant talks over what she will be doing to \u201chelp\u201d and no one has asked me what I need. \n\nWe (hub & I) end up getting in a big argument about it because Our house is over crowded now, I\u2019m literally about to pop out a baby & that seems to be everyone\u2019s least concern here. I\u2019m stressed to the max I\u2019m over hosting, I can\u2019t find anything she puts away, we are all waiting for bathrooms, lack of sleep, & I\u2019m being told I NEED help to do the jobs that I do everyday just fine. \n\nThe only help I agreed to was having her come watch our older kids (3&8) while I was giving birth. \n\nThe next day she completely avoids me & hides in the bsmt all afternoon, & only talks to him & our kids. So now on top of all the stress I\u2019m being treated like the bad guy & now feeling even more awkward & I\u2019m being avoided \n\nSo I ask my hub about this it ends in argument & he calls his sis in to come talk which I didn\u2019t want because now I\u2019m the monster in the middle.  She tells me well her thing is that she doesn\u2019t get to be a mom so she\u2019s trying to do this now here with her daughter. (SN; that she chooses to work out of town & could be here if she chose to be,) I told her that right now that\u2019s not my problem & my only concern right now is having this baby & being comfortable in my own home as I didn\u2019t ask for any of this \u201chelp\u201d. \n\nShe said well if I don\u2019t want her help then she will leave tmr.

Just wait until the baby arrives and is constantly woken up to barking dogs and running kids and an SIL that is zero help and a husband that still doesn't want to talk about it.  Your husband's attitude toward this is disturbing and whether he wants to talk about it or not, it's time for a serious sit down WITHOUT the SIL present.

But, if a stranger on the internet is concerned, you should be too. \n\nWhoever was right or wrong doesn\u2019t matter when a pregnant woman\u2019s health is on the line so forget your need to justify or clarify past actions. Anyone who cares about your wife and the little family you created together needs to concentrate on making her feel calm and strong going forward. Let her make the key decisions. Consult her about what makes her feel comfortable and provide that. Don\u2019t bring in any additional conflict, like extra people, if she needs her space. \n\nLooking back on this, in the future, do you wanna be the guy who stressed his wife out and had huge fights while she was 9 months pregnant with their third child?

People \u00ab\u00a0helping\u00a0\u00bb with something you\u2019ve never asked for can be stressful and do more damage. So that help was not Intended for your wife since she had no say in it. For me having a new child at home at this time is a huge no. That can become stressful for older kids also. They are already adapting to the fact, that parents s are more busyand will be bonding with new baby soon, now where will be one more child constantly living in their home. It is good if they are happy to spend time together now, but living with somebody is not the same and their compatibility can change any moment. But even if kids are perfectly happy together and your sister set up her goal to keep your wife\u2019s life easy and do everything not to stress her out, such arrangements  days before birth/weeks after birth should be fully approved by your wife as she will be the one most impacted.", "But I said sorry \ud83d\ude1e", "Well that's just it.. we're missing vital parts of the story here", "Because he wanted you to feel uncomfortable.\n\nHe wanted you to be the bad guy.\n\nHe knew, they both knew they were being total ah to get what they wanted.\n\nThey used you being super pregnant and vulnerable as an excuse to get what they wanted.

You have someone there that makes you feel comfortable and as less stressed as possible.", "Yeah you're right, thank you", "Get over yourself", "See this is the problem.\n\nThe issue has been rectified, my sister said on her own will (with no animosity) that she understands, and if her being there is more bad than good she can go, this was a sincere comment, not malicious.\n\nSo the issue has been solved, my sister is leaving, I've actually apologized for my lack of forethought, and for reading the situation wrong, among whatever else I've apologized for, and made the suggestion that we should move forward to enjoy the birth of our daughter..\n\nThis post was purely based on the OPs need to show that \"see, even they think you're stupid\" \n\nSo here I am, defending myself against a bunch of faceless nobodies lol\n\nI thought context would help, but I've realized early in my attempt that I'm up against a bunch of keyboard warriors with nothing better to do than flex their self proclaimed judge powers, and jump to conclusions, without knowing much of the context", "In mind it\u2019s him being super lazy, like your wife handles this all while pregnant, but now with her being unable to do it, he brings someone else in to do things , technically he should be covering while OP recovers.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I can see him maybe needing additional guidance if he\u2019s never done the day to day before , but he just brought his sis into completely out source the whole thing.", "Facts", "It's clarification. Trust me, details matter", "Whew, if No-Nefarious is truly the husband he is really going at this hard and strong. No wonder OP has been feeling so stressed out. \n\nThink husband needs to take a deep breath and although everyone\u2019s intentions may have been good, the person they were meant to be supporting is saying this isn\u2019t working for her. She\u2019s feeling disempowered and infantilised within her own family. Husband needs to let go of the angry defensiveness, listen and consider who his priority is here.", "Preach sister", "Her high blood pressure isn\u2019t going to go away by ignoring the problem, rolling over and showing her fluffy belly. It\u2019ll just eat away at her subconscious and when the doctor asks \u2018are you stressed?\u2019 She\u2019ll say no, of course not. We settled the argument. But the problem still exists. OP needs to decide what SHE wants, and then rant and scream for however long it takes until she gets it. Then and only then will her blood pressure come down. Husband needs to get with the program and do what is necessary for her, as dictated by her.", "Well for starters 2-3 weeks was never mentioned it was just assumed for about a day, before I realized that seeing as how she took a layoff she would be off until the new year, so we sat down and had a conversation about her coming for 3 months... no objections then, we mutually agreed it would be a lot, but that was it", "Nothing really, just got in the way if you ask me", "Yup that's right \u2705\ufe0f \n\nGreat advice, got anymore?", "I hope everything works out and the birth goes well. I know it feels like everyone\u2019s against you. I think a lot of us have been your wife at some point in our own lives which is why we\u2019ve risen to her defence so passionately, as we\u2019ve spoken from a platform of lived experience. \n\nAll the best of luck and hope you get through the next few months of midnight feeds with your sanity still fairly intact.", "Wow, if your \"apology\" to your wife was anything like your attitude to commenters trying to give you legitimate helpful advice, then it's no wonder she felt the need to make this post.\n\nInviting your sister and steamrolling your wife whenever she tried to share how uncomfortable it was making her was only half the problem. She's trying to tell you what she needs from you but you STILL aren't listening to her. \n\nLook, you made a goof. We can take your word that it was well intentioned but by getting defensive instead of communicating you are only making the problem worse. Put your ego to one side and Listen. To. Your. Wife!", "Wow, you say the issue is solved while insulting your wife and a bunch of faceless nobodies.\n\nIs it hard to be the eternal victim?", "You got your wife to the point where she had to see if she was wrong and yes to show you.\n\nWhy? Because I\u2019m guessing you showed no accountability. You made out like it was her issue.\n\nThis was you putting your sister\u2019s needs before your wife (her using your home as a place to be with her daughter).\n\nThis was you using this situation to do less (your sister picking up your slack)\n\nYou forgot your wife as a person. You have no care about your wife and her feelings despite this being her home and despite her current state.\n\nYour response to all this is \u201clook! I did the thing. Get over it!\u201d Attitude is crap.\n\nYou\u2019ve shown your wife how you  can be at her most vulnerable and you don\u2019t think she needs you to really show her you get it. Full accountability, remorse and to show you won\u2019t pull that crap again.\n\nShame on you.", "The actual heart of the issue is that you decided your sister would come and \u201chelp\u201d without discussing it with your wife. The problem was compounded when your sister felt like her husband and daughter should also join her and you allowed it. The real issue is that you completely disregarded what your wife needed or wanted.\n\nYou say that the issue has been rectified, but you don\u2019t recognize what the issue actually is.", "It's their 3rd child, not the first one. If he's useless while she recovers how did they dealt with it before? \n\nNTA OP but your husband is.

Your wife needed help with the kids whilst giving birth not having to entertain someone else and have her safe space invaded before and after for 3 freaking months.\n\nDo you like your wife?
