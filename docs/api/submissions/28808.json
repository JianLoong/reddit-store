My hub asked his sis to come ( lives in a diff city) & help take care of our other 2 kids while we go to have our bb when the time comes. I was appreciative of this when he told me she was coming as this wasn\u2019t supposed to be long term. I assumed 2-3 weeks. Next thing I know my hub is telling me she will be here for 3 mths after we have already agreed she come up. I\u2019m not very happy about this as I don\u2019t want a full time visitor for that long with our new bb, I voice my concerns But we can\u2019t do anything about it now as she is already coming .. She shows up and is great at first , but now her daughter (12) who lives full time in the same city as us with her dad is also staying with us. This was never part of the agreement or plan at any point. So now our houshold has doubled chaos while we prep for bb & while we are deep in Reno\u2019s - we only have 1 bathrm rn that is right next to our room, so everytime someone comes up the stairs to use it, our dogs bark or someone gets woken up. This is obvs annoying wo the 2 extra people here, but on top of being woken up multiple times a night now we have two school aged lo\u2019s trying to get ready in the am & this was never ran by me. My hub also told his sis that she will be taking over all school drop & pick ups for our son wo letting me know (I am a sahm) they have been in constant talks over what she will be doing to \u201chelp\u201d and no one has asked me what I need. We (hub & I) end up getting in a big argument about it because Our house is over crowded now, I\u2019m literally about to pop out a baby & that seems to be everyone\u2019s least concern here. I\u2019m stressed to the max I\u2019m over hosting, I can\u2019t find anything she puts away, we are all waiting for bathrooms, lack of sleep, & I\u2019m being told I NEED help to do the jobs that I do everyday just fine. The only help I agreed to was having her come watch our older kids (3&8) while I was giving birth. The next day she completely avoids me & hides in the bsmt all afternoon, & only talks to him & our kids. So now on top of all the stress I\u2019m being treated like the bad guy & now feeling even more awkward & I\u2019m being avoided So I ask my hub about this it ends in argument & he calls his sis in to come talk which I didn\u2019t want because now I\u2019m the monster in the middle.  She tells me well her thing is that she doesn\u2019t get to be a mom so she\u2019s trying to do this now here with her daughter. (SN; that she chooses to work out of town & could be here if she chose to be,) I told her that right now that\u2019s not my problem & my only concern right now is having this baby & being comfortable in my own home as I didn\u2019t ask for any of this \u201chelp\u201d. She said well if I don\u2019t want her help then she will leave tmr. I didn\u2019t argue her leaving, If she was so set on helping me why did she run everything past my hub instead of asking me what I needed.
