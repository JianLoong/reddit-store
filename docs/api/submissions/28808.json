My hub asked his sis to come ( lives in a diff city) & help take care of our other 2 kids while we go to have our bb when the time comes. I was appreciative of this when he told me she was coming as this wasn\u2019t supposed to be long term. I assumed 2-3 weeks. \n\nNext thing I know my hub is telling me she will be here for 3 mths after we have already agreed she come up. I\u2019m not very happy about this as I don\u2019t want a full time visitor for that long with our new bb, I voice my concerns But we can\u2019t do anything about it now as she is already coming .. She shows up and is great at first , but now her daughter (12) who lives full time in the same city as us with her dad is also staying with us. \n\nThis was never part of the agreement or plan at any point. So now our houshold has doubled chaos while we prep for bb & while we are deep in Reno\u2019s - we only have 1 bathrm rn that is right next to our room, so everytime someone comes up the stairs to use it, our dogs bark or someone gets woken up. This is obvs annoying wo the 2 extra people here, but on top of being woken up multiple times a night now we have two school aged lo\u2019s trying to get ready in the am & this was never ran by me. \n\nMy hub also told his sis that she will be taking over all school drop & pick ups for our son wo letting me know (I am a sahm) they have been in constant talks over what she will be doing to \u201chelp\u201d and no one has asked me what I need. \n\nWe (hub & I) end up getting in a big argument about it because Our house is over crowded now, I\u2019m literally about to pop out a baby & that seems to be everyone\u2019s least concern here. I\u2019m stressed to the max I\u2019m over hosting, I can\u2019t find anything she puts away, we are all waiting for bathrooms, lack of sleep, & I\u2019m being told I NEED help to do the jobs that I do everyday just fine. \n\nThe only help I agreed to was having her come watch our older kids (3&8) while I was giving birth. \n\nThe next day she completely avoids me & hides in the bsmt all afternoon, & only talks to him & our kids. So now on top of all the stress I\u2019m being treated like the bad guy & now feeling even more awkward & I\u2019m being avoided \n\nSo I ask my hub about this it ends in argument & he calls his sis in to come talk which I didn\u2019t want because now I\u2019m the monster in the middle.  She tells me well her thing is that she doesn\u2019t get to be a mom so she\u2019s trying to do this now here with her daughter. (SN; that she chooses to work out of town & could be here if she chose to be,) I told her that right now that\u2019s not my problem & my only concern right now is having this baby & being comfortable in my own home as I didn\u2019t ask for any of this \u201chelp\u201d. \n\nShe said well if I don\u2019t want her help then she will leave tmr.

Just wait until the baby arrives and is constantly woken up to barking dogs and running kids and an SIL that is zero help and a husband that still doesn't want to talk about it.  Your husband's attitude toward this is disturbing and whether he wants to talk about it or not, it's time for a serious sit down WITHOUT the SIL present.

But, if a stranger on the internet is concerned, you should be too. \n\nWhoever was right or wrong doesn\u2019t matter when a pregnant woman\u2019s health is on the line so forget your need to justify or clarify past actions. Anyone who cares about your wife and the little family you created together needs to concentrate on making her feel calm and strong going forward. Let her make the key decisions. Consult her about what makes her feel comfortable and provide that. Don\u2019t bring in any additional conflict, like extra people, if she needs her space. \n\nLooking back on this, in the future, do you wanna be the guy who stressed his wife out and had huge fights while she was 9 months pregnant with their third child?

People \u00ab\u00a0helping\u00a0\u00bb with something you\u2019ve never asked for can be stressful and do more damage. So that help was not Intended for your wife since she had no say in it. For me having a new child at home at this time is a huge no. That can become stressful for older kids also. They are already adapting to the fact, that parents s are more busyand will be bonding with new baby soon, now where will be one more child constantly living in their home. It is good if they are happy to spend time together now, but living with somebody is not the same and their compatibility can change any moment. But even if kids are perfectly happy together and your sister set up her goal to keep your wife\u2019s life easy and do everything not to stress her out, such arrangements  days before birth/weeks after birth should be fully approved by your wife as she will be the one most impacted.", "But I said sorry \ud83d\ude1e", "Well that's just it.. we're missing vital parts of the story here", "Because he wanted you to feel uncomfortable.\n\nHe wanted you to be the bad guy.\n\nHe knew, they both knew they were being total ah to get what they wanted.\n\nThey used you being super pregnant and vulnerable as an excuse to get what they wanted.

More than one thing can be the problem. lol", "Thank you, essentially I was finding all of these things out bit by bit, that her stay was longer and with her daughter that her and my hub has discussed her new role and responsibilities without me and he told me after I complained to him that I should just confront her which I also didn\u2019t think was fair to be consistently confrontational when I didn\u2019t even know what was happening or what the plan would be. I was trying to keep the peace but hubs invited her into our argument which was also unfair. Which ended up in a blow up fight because she was still under the impression she was \u201chelping\u201d after I had mentioned nicely a few times that I could continue doing what I had always done and I was met with conceded comments from her like \u201cwell if that\u2019s what you need to feel put together you go right ahead\u201d maybe that wasn\u2019t the intent behind her comments but it felt that way after the tension.", "This guy really is a jacka$$", "Then your sister made an irresponsible decision. Why on earth would you let her do that?  So she could play house in your home with her child (and your newborn?)\n\nPut your wife and YOUR children first, anybody else second. If you can't understand that, marriage counseling. Sounds like your wife wants your sister's help for, what, a week? And you went, hey, three months sounds aweome. NO. Always ask the pregnant lady what she actually wants. Don't assume. Don't dictate.", "If she was there to mainly help the person who is actually pregnant and the other kids, it's clearly not happening because NOBODY ASKED/discussed with the person that is pregnant what is needed and what is not. OP should have been part of the conversation from the beginning! And that way your sister would.not have asked to be layed off. Your communication and decision making are atrocious. The only ah here is you, aka the husband. \n\nOP you are NTA.", "Yeah, he sneakily put this all on you. The whole \u201cit\u2019s your decision\u201d game. He should have told his SIL \u201cno\u201d himself. Like he shouldn\u2019t have brought her into your private conversation either, forcing you to take the fall. If my spouse invited his sis to stay in our house when I had a new baby, she extended her visit to three months, and my spouse told her \u201cyou have to leave because @us_571 doesn\u2019t want you here,\u201d I would never forgive him lol. I would have expected him to say to her: \u201cI don\u2019t think this works for our family,\u201d or, at the absolute least, \u201cwe don\u2019t think this works for our family.\u201d \n\nI agree you should have been more firm but I do see how he put you in a bad place too.", "'During our first argument which happened after I found out niece was now living with us too'  \ud83d\udc48 this sentence shows utter disrespect from your husband that he didn't discuss niece moving in!!!?? WTF? \nHe also didn't discuss the length of time YOU wanted his sister here for. You have a husband with a communication problem, I wish you luck whichever way you go forward in your journey but respect in a marriage is one of the most important values imo", "You were tricked and trapped into it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t tell you til it was too late and then got his sister to be there while they both stood against you to make you feel small.\n\nYour husband has zero respect for you.\nThis should be showing you quite clearly who he is.", "He has zero respect for you.\n\nHe\u2019s shown his sister that she\u2019s priority.\nThey both tag teamed you and knew exactly what they were doing.\n\nThat\u2019s why she avoided you.\n\nI mean they discussed what was happening in your own home like you were the guest. \nMade big decisions and then when you didn\u2019t agree he pushed it all on you.\n\nHe is utterly disgusting to do this to you and has shown how little he respects you.", "You were lied to. In another comment he says he intended for her to move in permanently after the three months.\n\nNone of this was to help you. It was to help her. That isn't inherently bad. The lie and calling you crazy for recognizing things weren't as they seem are.\n\nI hope you can take a break from the stress.", "I think the word you're looking for is \"controlling\". \n\nThey cooked up this scenario where she gets to come to live rent-free in your place under the false pretense of helping you. You weren't given a choice. This is all being forced on you and you're being gaslighted into believing it all for you and your own good. \n\nBut, they didn't *ask* you anything so, it's clearly a ruse for her to live there and play temporary mommy. She basically abandoned her kid for a job and sees it as your husband's responsibility to help *her* see her child, regardless of what you want or need. The baby is just the most convenient excuse. How much do you want to bet that sister does little to no actual helping? She probably will want the fun parts -- holding and feeding the baby while you do the dirty diapers and chores.\n\nI would give her a deadline to move out and, if she doesn't, don't come home from the hospital until she's gone. Stay with friends or relatives. If you don't stop it now, she may decide to never move out. This may be their long-term plan so you need her out before she can establish tenancy. Protect yourself OP. Your husband and his sister have made their plans so you need to make your own. NTA", "Ikr I\u2019ve been reading his comments and it\u2019s only getting worse. I think him inviting his sister over was well intentioned, but ended up not working out. He wanted her there for his wife, she wanted to be there for her daughter. Ever since it obviously didn\u2019t work out the hole has only been getting deeper.", "We don't believe you.   \n\n* We don't believe that you wife agreed that having three adults and three children share one bathroom in anticipation of a newborn and post-partum period was a reasonable thing to plan.   We don't believe that.\n\n* We don't believe there was any active agreement to have your sister stay for more than a week -- 10 days maximum.   We don't believe that\n\n* We don't believe that your wife ever indicated that she was okay with you making unilateral plans with your sister and presenting them as decided.   We don't believe that she didn't make her feelings about that plain all along.\n\n* We don't believe that she ever agreed that your sister's issues should have any kind of priority in your lives at this time.\n\nWe don't believe you have been honest at all about your various missteps in any of this.", "Do you even like your wife? You seem so blase.", "Yea, please get a vasectomy.", "Yes, you ARE The Asshole. An even bigger one than OP made out, considering you were sneaking around making these decisions without her.", "YES!", "Love it when people insist they are helping when they\u2019re additional work. My mil was an expert at this!  \n\nSil was using helping you as an excuse to get a free place to live. Your husband should not have hurt you like this.", "Okay so then she\u2019ll be leaving first thing, right? Or this was posted yesterday, so surely she\u2019s gone by now?", "So ahe was getting laid off and wheedled free housing? And what makes you thinl adding a 12 year old to a house with one bathroom and 2 other kids is \"pleasant\" for your wife?", "Dude. No. You are being such a bad partner right now. You are the one who is wrong here. So, so wrong.", "I don\u2019t think anyone believes you\u2019re sorry, least of all your wife. Doubling down on your poor choices is also not earning you any points. Do you know what to do when you find yourself in a hole? Stop. Digging.", "Throw his ass out. He is not a keeper", "She did not request a lay off. A lay off is not optional. Either she got laid off or she took a leave of absence. And if she took a 3-month leave of absence from work for this, especially without your wife\u2019s enthusiastic agreement, then she is truly an idiot.", "OP take put the trash. Being a single.Mom has got to be easier than this garbage. Ypu are not crazy. Your sppuse is acting like a uncaring, unloving, misogynistic AH who doesnt care abput you at all. You are being emotionally abused. Here. On this post. Can you move in with your family while getting away from him?", "Divorce lawyer time. Counselling with him isnt worth it.", "OP is that your husband commenting above? \ud83d\ude44", "Who he doesnt care about, at all.", "There are 2 bathrooms. 1 is being renovated.. but we have another in our room", "I guess you've never been a tradesperson in Canada who chases work?\n\nShe takes/requests a layoff every year in December..\n\nThere was enthusiastic agreement..", "The only details that truly matter, apparently don\u2019t to you.", "Was this supposed to make you look better and less of an AH? Because it\u2019s not. \n\nYour unborn daughter is more mature than you based on your comments and tone.", "You are a huge AH. Dont play with fire cause child support and alimony is expensive\u2026", "You're a major AH. You admit that you tricked your wife by lying to her on how long your sister will stay. You didn't take her concerns into account. You're a really shitty husband and if you don't realise this soon, you won't be a husband anymore. Then have fun playing house with your sister.", "Keen one you are", "You are so gifted and intelligent for figuring this out on your own, I congratulate you on your reddit success", "No"]}
