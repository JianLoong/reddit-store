I\u2019m going over to family\u2019s house on Halloween I\u2019m going to a chili cook off at my aunts on Saturday and Friday we are supposed to play dominos (aka Mexican train is another name) I have played with my grandparents multiple times and I told my mom that I would go which it\u2019s at my uncles house. I got a text from my friend asking if I wanted to go roller skating on Friday at 7 the game starts around 5:30-6 and it\u2019s about a half hour drive so I would have ti leave at 6:30. Since they live a little farther away I don\u2019t see them very often and I enjoy seeing them when I can. They do go roller skating somewhat often but they haven\u2019t gone the past couple weeks do to planning issues and people not being available. Now here is where I want your guys opinion, my mom thinks I\u2019m being selfish for saying I would go to my uncles and then taking other plans which I still want to go and see everyone but I would leave pretty early on. I feel like it\u2019s not that big of a deal considering I\u2019m still going and I\u2019m going to other events plus I never miss big family events. I love my family and of course I want to spend time with them and I haven\u2019t made a full decision yet I just want to know if I\u2019m being a jerk. I would like to add my mom also thinks it\u2019s crappy that I\u2019m going and leaving very shortly afterwards idk I try to do what I can to balance friends and family and I probably don\u2019t do the best sometimes but I want an outside opinion please and thank you.

You'll need to notify your hosts that you're dropping by for only a short time because you're meeting with other people. And you'll need to tell them the reason you're leaving game night is because other people's plans sound more appealing to you. If you're young (which i'm guessing you are), that's not such a big deal. if you're an adult, you're telling the other adults in your life that you'll ditch them for more interesting plans whenever you can.", "Most of them have college/high school and I don\u2019t have many chances to see them. However I get what you mean with making a commitment thank you", "I\u2019m 19 and I try to do as much as I can with family and I wouldn\u2019t say a lot but the regular family I hang out with being my immediate family both my aunt and uncles and my grandparents with maybe a couple added here and there. I fully planned on telling them I don\u2019t do this often.", "Okay, as a teenager who is already spending  a lot of time with the family, i'm going NTA. But you still need to let your hosts know you'll only stay for a short time on game night so you can meet up with people your age. \n\nPlease remember as you get older that it is considered rude to bail on one set of plans for another. At some point you are going to want to have a relationship of equals with the other adults in your family, and you'll need to honor your commitments to them."]}
