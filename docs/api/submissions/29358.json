I said \"I'm sorry you got hurt but it wasn't my fault, I've used the tool many times and didn't expect you to hurt yourself\". \n\nHe blames me saying that it's my fault for asking his help and is my fault because I should have let him make the crumble.

I don't understand people saying y.t.a. for asking a grown man for help with prepping fruit. He's not a 5 year old that has to be supervised around sharp objects and it sounds like weaponized incompetence here. Loading an apple peeler isn't rocket science. Helping a partner make a treat you enjoy isn't a big ask either.", "NTA. We're all responsible for our own clumsiness. He's pouting like a 10 year old.", "NTA, sounds like he may have lashed out in pain, but he is responsible for his own actions. If he didn't want to help or if he didn't want to use the peeler he could have said no, but he didn't -  he agreed and then hurt himself. He should apologise to you for lashing out.", "Accidents happen and it sounds like he\u2019s being childish about it. It\u2019s not your fault. NTA", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Knives are not for babies. Tell him you are sorry he is not old enough to use knives and sharp tools. Maybe your kitchen needs some babyproofing to keep your partner safe?**", "NTA - How is it your fault that his mishandling of a common kitchen tool got him hurt? If he had questions on its use, he could have asked. Blaming you for this, and even making that big a deal out of it, seems very childish to me.", "NTA - There's a lot of kitchen tools my partner has that I have no idea how to use correctly (he loves his cooking gadgets) and if he asked me for help I'd ask him to show me how to use it properly if I was uncomfortable. \n\nIf I still didn't feel comfortable using it and there was danger of cutting myself I'd just tell him I'd rather do something else and he'd be absolutely fine with that. \n\nSounds like he almost tried using it without knowing out of spite then blamed you for the accident. He's childish for his reaction. Next time maybe ask him 'do you know how to use this?' and if he says no, you can show him, then you've disarmed him from blaming you if anything goes wrong.", "You are not TA. I would turn all those apples into applesauce. If he wants to act like a baby, treat him like one and make applesauce instead of apple pies or apple crumble.

Why does it even matter who\u2019s fault it is? Why are you two so immature as to even discuss fault? Stay present!", "YTA for being experienced but not showing him how to use a sharp implement safely and then immediately stating it's his fault. Where'd the love and fun go? Plus you threw a tantrum and quit, not mature at all i'm afraid.  \n\nThat being said, he's an ass for holding it against his partner. 29M and he's crying over a cut thumb?

My 6yo niece can use the safety apple peeler under supervision without cutting herself. If anyone is to blame it\u2019s whoever raised him for skipping that in his education hahaha.", "NTA. What a baby! I've cut myself while cleaning a very sharp peeler, deep enough to probably have needed stitches, and didn't blame anyone but myself for it.", "NTA are we really sure he is 29?", "NTA. Accidents happen.", "NTA\n\nHe didn't follow basic instructions and he got injured because of it and then blamed you. He's weaponizing his incompetence to get out of having to do work.

He needed ONE plaster, it\u2019s not like he needed stitches. Should she be treated like a fragile piece of glass throughout her whole period every month? \n\n4. Probably because she knew he was going to blame her\u2026 which he did. \n\n5. She isn\u2019t the \u201cimmature\u201d one, that would be the person who cried over a little cut and made his partner clean it and put a plaster on it.\n\n6. Huh?

I got upset after becuase I thought it would be a fun thing for us to do together and when he got hurt I felt bad and him shouting at me made me feel worse, I didn't think I had to explain to him about the tool.

He\u2019s an ADULT. It\u2019s not nearly as dramatic as you\u2019re making it out to be lol OP is NTA", "As I said in my other comment, NTA, but don't assume everyone knows how to use tools. I hate the whole 'you're immature if you can't use this' for the first time which some people are implying. Whether it's easy to use or not, some people need to be shown or have the thing explained before they can know how to do something correctly or feel comfortable doing so.", "Look at the username.\n\nAnswers all ur questions.\n\nNTA, btw OP. Weaponized incompetence needs to backfire every now and then.", "Where's his responsibility to ask?", "He should, but that doesn't mean he will next time and if OP asks first she's eliminating any chance of him saying 'it's your fault'. But obviously deeper problems are at play if he can't simply ask her. You're right"]}
