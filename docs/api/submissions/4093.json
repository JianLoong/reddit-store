Assuming your mother divided up her assets equally, he would have been given 1/3 of her 1/3 of the house\n\nAt which time he could have forced another sale and gotten even more money\n\nTruth be told, it sounds like your family is better of without him\n\nNTA", "NTA your brother is a piece of work", "Nta", "NTA: \n\nAhhh nothing like money to make people become greedy. Let\u2019s call a spade a spade here. Your elder bro isn\u2019t angry because a family decision was made without him. He\u2019s angry because he\u2019s lost an investment in the house. He expected to get a piece of the property and was likely going to do the same thing he did with his first time. If your mom\u2019s share of the house was divided 3 ways between you three, he\u2019d get a third of her portion that he had already sold his share to back once already and was looking to do it again. And probably to sell for more than it\u2019s worth again. By cutting him off from that inheritance, he will not be getting any of it. So he\u2019s angry that he\u2019s losing it. \n\nThe fact is, while it may be seen as a bit underhanded to not tell him about it, simply out of courtesy as a family member, the cold hard fact is that it doesn\u2019t involve him. Your mom is her own individual, competent to make her own decisions. Just as you and your other brother are. The sale was the business of the parties involved only. Therefore, you did not need to disclose any of it to your elder brother.  \n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s not like he was cut out and excluded from an inheritance. This was a sale. You purchased the property, your mom didn\u2019t give it to you two for free. The money she gained from it is hers to do with what she wants, just like the property was hers to sell to whomever she decided to sell it to. \n\nI\u2019m guessing your brother is afraid that she\u2019s going to spend the money from the sale, or divide that up amongst the three of you equally in her will, rather than give him what he thought should have been his portion and value of the property to him. He\u2019s not wrong to expect that to occur if your mom ends up in a nursing home or long term care facility. her assets will go to that first. \n\nBut, what is wrong is that he expects an inheritance at all. Your mom is not required to leave anything to anyone, including him. Your elder brother lashing out at your mom for selling is awful. He\u2019s demanding an apology from his brothers, so he should be taking it up directly with his brothers, not emotionally abusing his mother with ultimatums, manipulation and guilt. \nHe\u2019s just out of line in every aspect of this. \n\nBut look at the bright side, he knows about the sale now so it won\u2019t be an issue when your mom does pass and you\u2019re all dealing with grieving as well as all the stress from the rest of her final affairs.

I think a lot of people who've buried their heads in the sand about their retirement needs turn grasping at about that age. You haven't done anything wrong, this is who and where he is now. In time, he may come to terms with his financial reality, adjust his lifestyle and expectations, and reach out to make amends, or he may feel vaguely hard done by forever. Either way, it's work he needs to do on himself, you can't influence it.", "Not if mum has a will and exclude this son from the property inheritance", "She can do anything she likes; she can give everything to charity or to the Ukrainian war effort.\n\nBut if she chooses to split all of her assets fairly, then he\u2019d get an equal share of her 1/3 share of the house (I.e., 1/9 of the house).  The reasonable brothers converted her share of the house to cash, so now he will likely get 1/3 of that cash from the sale of the house.  Thus he\u2019ll get his equal share (if that\u2019s what Mom says in her will), but this way he has no say in the house.", "No idea, but I'm getting the impression OPs brother is a bit of a jem that way.\n\nIt was the OPs childhood home so i assume it was a marital property. Even if she couldn't own it when they intially married she is likely to be an assumed owner today... And would explain why mom was cool selling her portion if she owned the majority and at inheritance they'd all be pretty close to equal joint owners again.", "NTA\n\nYou bought out your brother. You and your brother bought out your mother.  No family decision was made, you and brother paid your mother to take her name off the deed and now it is only you and your brother. \n\nYour other brother can pound sand.   It is pretty clear that he figured he would reap some financial reward after your mother passed away, and now he may not.  Sorry your brother is a greedy AH.", "NTA. He lost all rights and claim to the property once he was bought out. He got his money he wanted. His say in and claim over that home was over.", "NTA. I am not sure why you are giving him the option to ever speak to you again. Cut him off like the fucking leech he is.", "NTA\n\nyour brother is a petulant child you got mad after he cut himself out of the family by being an unemphatic AH.\n\nDon't apologize. It's not like you talk to him much anyway.", "He hadnt talk to tall for a while, what made him think he deserved a share ? Was he just out there, impatiently waiting for your mom to pass away, just to cash out ? \n\n\nNta", "nta mums share = mums choice.", "NTA, unless your mom doesn\u2019t have the authority to make her own decision she can decided to do whatever she wants with her possessions.\n\nHonestly you should make sure there is a no contesting Claus in her will so your older brother can\u2019t mess you all around when she does pass on one day (hopefully not anytime soon)", "Yes we had several valuations, none of which estimated the property value anywhere near what he was suggesting", "\u2026what is that\u2026?", "It\u2019s always nice when the trash takes itself out", "Except that, in many places, this is how inheritance works. There are also many (tax) benefits to this.", "Thank you. Yes that was our rationale, especially since he started making comments not long after dad passed away - little brother and I don\u2019t want to deal with that again after mum is gone and we are grieving", "The irony is that in terms of salary my elder brother earns the most. Our younger brother is a teacher so actually earns the least, he had to take a loan which is why I think his wife ended up blabbing because she must have been talking about having to tighten their budget\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t know why elder brother has so many expenses and I don\u2019t want to ask, that\u2019s his business. I\u2019m just frustrated that money I was saving toward retirement had to go to this and on top of that he\u2019s really hurt mum", "We are yes, he\u2019s 62 so getting close to retirement age. I do think that may have something to do with the change in attitude", "What I mean is, if the mother and the brothers wanted to prevent the anal brother from pulling this shit again, why not stipulate in the will that her share of the house goes to the two reasonable brothers and cut the anal brother out completely. He can have her other assets where he can't extort from the two brothers. I feel like rewriting the will is much easier than going through paperwork of selling the house. And on the plus side, he won't find out the mother does this until she dies and he also has no say in that will... which would prevent the whole situation where the anal brother is bitching to OP and the mother. Honestly if I was the mother I would just cut the anal brother out of the will completely after the shit he pulled.", "The way this was written it sounds like Mom wants to evenly split her assets among the three boys.  Reducing the share for jerk brother is easier, so if everyone went through the hassle buying out Mom now then I feel the goal was to remove jerk brother from having a share in the house without reducing his inheritance.  \n\nIf we accept that Mom doesn\u2019t want to reduce BadBro\u2019s inheritance, then converting Mom\u2019s share of the house into cash now, which will then be split in the estate disbursement solves the problem.", "You can fight a will. You can\u2019t fight a deed or a mortgage.", "It's not your brother's house. Period", "NTA. Your brother does not have any say so about the house anymore. He does not own it anymore. Your brother is up to no good, if you and your younger brother ever decides to sell, your older brother is going to feel like he should also get a piece of the money. Even though he has no claim in the house. You and your brother should consult a lawyer right away and speak on what's happening with your older brother. Also you two need to stand up to him and let him know that the house is no longer of his concern and it's not his business what happens with the house.", "This is longer than the post \ud83e\udd23", "Yes this makes most sense as to his motive."]}
