Let\u2019s call a spade a spade here. Your bro isn\u2019t angry because a family decision was made without him. He\u2019s angry because he\u2019s lost an investment in the house. He expected to get a piece of the property and was likely going to do the same thing he did with his first time. Sell for more than it\u2019s worth. By cutting him off from that inheritance, he will not be getting it. So he\u2019s angry that he\u2019s losing it. \n\nThe fact is, while it was a bit underhanded to not tell him about it, out of courtesy as a family member, the cold hard fact is that it doesn\u2019t involve him. Your mom is her own individual, competent to make her own decisions. Just as you and your other brother are. \nThe sale was the business of the parties involved only. Therefore, you did not need to disclose any of it to your elder brother.  \n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s not like he was cut out and excluded from an inheritance. This was a sale. You purchased the property, your mom didn\u2019t give it to you two for free. The money she gained from it is hers to do with what she wants, just like the property was hers to sell to whomever she decided to sell it to. \n\nI\u2019m guessing your brother is afraid that she\u2019s going to spend the money or divide that up amongst the three of you equally in her will, rather than give what he thought should have been his portion and value of the property to him. And he\u2019s not wrong to expect that to occur if your mom ends up in a nursing home or long term care facility, her assets will go to that But, what is wrong is that he expects an inheritance at all. Your mom is not required to leave anything to anyone, including him. Him lashing out at your mom for selling is awful. He\u2019s demanding an apology from his brothers, so he should be taking it up directly with his brothers, not emotionally abusing his mother with ultimatums, manipulation and guilt. \nHe\u2019s just out of line in every aspect of this. \n\nBut look at the bright side, he knows now, so it won\u2019t be an issue when your mom does pass and you\u2019re all dealing with grieving as well as all the stress from the rest of her final affairs.

Because he was an ass, they didn't even bother to let him know what they decided to do with mom's house. I don't blame them at all. But I do see why a person like him is really pissed about it: He had another pay-day planned.", "The mom should take the money and go on an expensive vacation!", "Weirdly, without the Sale, he would have ended up with almost the exact same amount of interest in the house as the other two kids (because they only own very small portions of the house currently and Mom owns the majority interest)... Until she sold that majority interest... \n\nSo yeah he was likely looking tk force a second buyout of this time a much larger portion... \n\nIf 1/12 was 110k than .8 /3 would have been probably close to 330k if the house retained its value and more if it continued to increase", "I don't know that, but it would be my guess. Why else be mad about mom selling her share of a house he already sold out of.", "Wait. I read this as only one house being at the center of dispute. Dad dies, leaving mom, both brother and daughter (OP) to share ownership. Greedy brother does his shady ish and is bought out. This leaves, mom, one brother and OP sharing ownership of the house. Then later, mom doesn\u2019t want a repeat so she sells her share to remaining bro and OP as now the only two owners of the home. Greedy brother is mad he didn\u2019t get a say in a home he already got bought out of\u2026. I might be missing something though.", "You're right. I stand corrected. There is only one house. I was confused about the forced sale and it being a rental property. I thought mom was worried about her personal house. However, if she's living elsewhere, she should probably do something about THAT house if she owns it."]}
