Chip in for the property suddenly?", "NTA. The only reason he's upset is because he wants the money from your mom's share of the house. There's need for you to apologize, plus you mentioned he barely talks to you all--what difference would it make?", "NTA but your older brother is. It sounds like he has anger issues and a possible problem (drug or gambling perhaps?) He was expecting a third of your mother's shares when she passed so he could force you to buy him out at far above market price again. His behavior is atrocious. This is such a sad situation and I am sorry you're going through it.", "You are NTA. \nHe **sold** his interest in the house, and with that, he gave up any and all \"right\" to be involved in any future decisions about it.\n\nTell your mom not to listen to him - he is wrong, and he is being an AH.", "NTA. What in the actual heck is he talking about? He's not the owner of the house. That was his own choice. What happens to it now is ZERO of his business. Stand your ground and make sure your mom is protected from his harrassment.", "So, he insisted on selling out his portion of the house but now has the gall to be upset that he isn't included in making decisions on it anymore? He can't have it both ways. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHow is he \"cut out\"?\n\nHe's no better or worse off and he's also got what he wanted which was the immediate cash from his 1/4 of the house. Instead of inheriting 1/3 of your mother's 1/3 of the house he will now inherit 1/3 of the money your mother has from selling her 1/3 of the house.\n\nI wonder if he doesn't understand the transaction and thinks you've tried to pull a fast one on him.", "NTA. He was bought out. He sold his claim to it literally. This is absurd. Why would he think he has any claim to what is done with the house? I cant fathom his reasoning", "NTA.  Once he was bought out of the house, he lost any input in what else happens with the house.  What exactly did he want to have happen - was he planning on vetoing you buying your mother out thinking he would re-inherit her portion?", "NTA.  Sounds like money was more important to him then family.  He has no stake in the property anymore and therefore no say in any decisions you and your other brother make regarding that property.", "NTA - he was definitely getting caught up in the money and he was the one \u201ccutting\u201d out the family when he went to a solicitor to force the sale", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. He already got more than his fair share of the money for this house and you\u2019re right. He\u2019s being a huge asshole and you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. \n\nIn fact, you\u2019re doing the smart thing by eliminating any chance that he\u2019ll try to double dip. And if that house does have sentimental value to you, your brother, and/or your mom, you\u2019re also doing the morally right thing by protecting it from his attempt to force a sale in the future.\n\nPersonally, as hard as it is, I would call his bluff here. His presence in your life isn\u2019t a gift to you. If he threatens to walk away, let him.", "NTA. He \"didn't care about the property\" when he had a share in it. As soon as he sold his share, any involvement he may have had in it was non-existent. He's just pissed off because he assumed that a third of your mum's share would go to him and he could force you and your brother to buy that from him too. Now you've beaten him to it, he'll just get a share of the cash rather than a grossly inflated price that screws you two out of your own inheritance.\n\nTell him to get fucked.", "NTA\n\nIt's not his property anymore. He already told y'all that he had no sentimental attachment to it (which is fine, not everyone does). The only thing left to consider, IMHO, is price.", "NTA. He cut himself out when he decided he didn\u2019t want to own any of it anymore.", "NTA\n\nI don't know why your brother would have any issues, you already bought him out.   I don't know why he'd get any part of your mother's property once she died unless she specifically left him something.", "NTA - You all bought him out already. Whatever happens to the house after that is NONE of his business. \n\nYour brother was clearly hoping to pull the same stunt once he inherited his share of her share of the house. But he has no claim on your mother's property or assets while she is alive. She can sell her share of the house and donate it to the squirrels as long as she is mentally fit.", "NTA. He\u2019s already demonstrated that his hunger for money has trumped everything else. He was counting on being able to extort you again and is angry at being thwarted. You\u2019ve become nothing more than another obstacle in his quest for easy money. Let him go sulk. You\u2019re better off without him.", "NTA.\n\nAll he cared about was the money by his own admission. He was bought out of his share, so none of his damn business what happens", "NTA.  Your brother wanted to cash out twice and screw over you and your younger brother.  Now he's mad that he can't do that.", "NTA - The phone (email, text) works both ways. After the sale he went low contact. He was paid and has no legal connection to the house. Infact, he put a burden on the family to require a payout. Folks stepped up and the house remained in the family. We share things with ease when you have a positive continual relationship with a sibling. He needs to adjust his perspective.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like Lil Bro was expecting another payday when Mom passed (1/3 of her share) to leverage for more cash from the remaining brothers. The sale has wiped that off the books, so he'll end up with less now.", "NTA", "NTA a bit rich to expect to be included in that kind of family decision when you\u2019ve already set yourself apart by threatening legal action.", "NTA. Apologize & say something like this: \u201cDear brother, I am sorry you are greedy & a trouble maker. I apologize for not giving you another opportunity to make me pay more for this house than it is worth.  Sincerely, OP\u201d", "NTA\n\nHe already owned a piece of the house, and had a say in what happens to it. He decided to sell it. \n\nNow he doesn't own it anymore, and doesn't get a say in what happens to it.", "NTA. It wasn't a family decision. It was a decision of the three owners of the home. Since your mothers leftover money will probably divided equally between her children, there is absolutely nothing unfair. The only thing that happened was that a future unfair situation was prevented.", "Wait so this guy is actively trying to gain two inheritances from the same property? Dad died and splits it by three so he forces the sale and he's hoping that when mom dies he gets more of it? That's pretty sleazy unless I understood that wrong, pretty sure he sold away his rights to make any decisions as well as inheritances when he said the house doesn't mean anything to him anymore", "NTA.

Let\u2019s call a spade a spade here. Your bro isn\u2019t angry because a family decision was made without him. He\u2019s angry because he\u2019s lost an investment in the house. He expected to get a piece of the property and was likely going to do the same thing he did with his first time. Sell for more than it\u2019s worth. By cutting him off from that inheritance, he will not be getting it. So he\u2019s angry that he\u2019s losing it. \n\nThe fact is, while it was a bit underhanded to not tell him about it, out of courtesy as a family member, the cold hard fact is that it doesn\u2019t involve him. Your mom is her own individual, competent to make her own decisions. Just as you and your other brother are. \nThe sale was the business of the parties involved only. Therefore, you did not need to disclose any of it to your elder brother.  \n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s not like he was cut out and excluded from an inheritance. This was a sale. You purchased the property, your mom didn\u2019t give it to you two for free. The money she gained from it is hers to do with what she wants, just like the property was hers to sell to whomever she decided to sell it to. \n\nI\u2019m guessing your brother is afraid that she\u2019s going to spend the money or divide that up amongst the three of you equally in her will, rather than give what he thought should have been his portion and value of the property to him. And he\u2019s not wrong to expect that to occur if your mom ends up in a nursing home or long term care facility, her assets will go to that But, what is wrong is that he expects an inheritance at all. Your mom is not required to leave anything to anyone, including him. Him lashing out at your mom for selling is awful. He\u2019s demanding an apology from his brothers, so he should be taking it up directly with his brothers, not emotionally abusing his mother with ultimatums, manipulation and guilt. \nHe\u2019s just out of line in every aspect of this. \n\nBut look at the bright side, he knows now, so it won\u2019t be an issue when your mom does pass and you\u2019re all dealing with grieving as well as all the stress from the rest of her final affairs. One less drama later.", "I think he was waiting for mom to pass away so he could force them to pay double for her share, screwing them over again for cash.  That opportunity was taken from him.", "It hurts my mum and to be honest for nearly 60 years he and I were very close.

Does it require to keep him updated re: the sale of this property?", "No it just means that on her death we would each inherit 1/3 of the total value of whatever her estate is rather than inheriting specific things from it", "So he thought he could double dip and not only take his full share but then take a 1/3rd of his moms share on her passing?
