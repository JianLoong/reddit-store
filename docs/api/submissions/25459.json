The relationship cannot be mended because he isn\u2019t going to change. And you need to be heathy and take care of yourself. \n\nIt seems as if you are an adult, because you mention getting a masters.

The silent treatment is a method to ensure safety when you\u2019re around him, and it\u2019s important to do everything in your power to get out now.

Like it\u2019s not just older people unable to deal with the rise of technology, but he\u2019s got the old mindset of females are inferior. This isn\u2019t your fault, it\u2019s his. It\u2019s his upbringing.

Some people may tell you it\u2019s immature and doesn\u2019t help. It does, or at least it did for me. Sometimes there\u2019s no point arguing with your Indian parent. \n\nMy dad eventually realised that I would just not respond to him if he yelled at me or I\u2019d yell back. While many people in my extended family wouldn\u2019t dream of standing up to their parents so violently, my parents taught me to not be a doormat (bet they regretted this when I was a teen). It may take a while to resolve this, but you\u2019ll be able to and your relationship will be stronger.

We are hard-wired to love our parents and sometimes that extends past the point where it is good for you.  From your post, I can see you are in that position - but also ready to do the hard work to walk away from being treated like this.  It is a difficult journey, and you may need therapy, good friends and any other help you can get.  But you can do it.
