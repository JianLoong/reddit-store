Don't stand here in front of me\". \n\nI still have no idea why I deserved that outburst. I was just going to use a online service to reduce the file-size. It felt horrible. This was after only last week, when there was a cupboard that needed fixing in our place. I've been telling my dad about it for ages. He did nothing.

I am too scared to even ask him simple things because I know he'll say something pointed and mean. I've stopped talking to him.
