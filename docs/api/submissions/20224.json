We took him to the vet, they recommended a high-protein diet. When that didn't work, I scheduled Skipper again in Feb. My BF, Jeff, took him in and they found a \"volleyball sized mass\" growing in his abdomen. They were shocked at how large it was since there was no sign of any growth in Nov. The vet said he was doing well so we could take him home.  \nPresent day, he has lost a significant amount of weight, hasn't had energy, isn't eating, and his #2s have gotten very dark and runny. Skipper is Jeff's first pet EVER, and I've had animals all my life, so I am familiar with the signs. Again, I had to be the one to make the appt. because Jeff would not hear my concerns. However, he did agree to a \"Quality of Life\" assessment appt..  \nThe vet said Skipper is not doing well \\[he's had the same vet all 9 years of his life\\] and that she can tell he is not the same dog. So they called Jeff to ask him what he would like to do, and we scheduled an euthanasia.  \nNow, during the time that Skipper has been sick, I have been the one to take care of him. I've gotten him pain killers and soft foods when he stopped eating solid. I wipe his rear after his runny #2's, and I carried him up the stairs every night when he wasn't able to climb them anymore. I am home with him, hand-feeding him, bathing him, taking him potty.... I love this boy.   \nSo now the dreaded day has come and Jeff drops a bomb on me saying I will not be going to the appt.. I asked him if he was messing with me and he said, \"No, I don't want anyone there. We already talked about this.\" Which, sidebar, we didn't. I mentioned to him the other day that WE can take my car so Skipper doesn't have to ride in his truck's bed and Jeff said \"Okay.\"  \nI told him that Skipper is my dog too and I deserve to get a chance to say goodbye and that I don't need his permission. I know the address and what time, I can just go without him. He said that it is not my right to do that and it is his decision because Skipper is his dog. I told Jeff he is being heartless to which he responded that I was crossing the line and trying to make it about me. He said that I can't be there because that is how he grieves. And I said I can't sit at home alone and just wait for you to come back and tell me Skipper is gone, I don't grieve that way.  \nJeff got very frustrated and snapped, he said that it is Skipper's last night and it is not my decision because he is not my dog. I don't want to get in a huge fight when there are bigger things on our plate...but, I want to be able to say goodbye to Skipper because he's my dog too and I love him. On the other hand, Jeff is Skipper's owner. He has had him since he was a puppy and I want to respect his wishes.  \nAITA if I show up to the appointment to say my goodbyes even if Jeff doesn't want me there?.... I just want to be able to kiss my boy goodnight one last time.  \n", "created_utc": 1687331959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f0kyh/aita_for_wanting_to_crash_my_bfs_dogs_euthanasia/", "score": 749, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a highly emotional time for you both and you grieve in different ways. \n\nI would suggest saying goodbye to Skipper before his appointment and letting Jeff go on his own with him. You have loved and cared for him, but I do think Jeff gets final say on this matter. \n\nRemember the good times", "NAH. This is such a difficult situation and it\u2019s obvious that your ways of dealing with this are so polar they\u2019re never going to come together. \n\nUltimately, I\u2019d respect your BFs wishes and let him go alone and have his last moment with his pet dog. \n\nWhat I would do though, is decide how I wanted to honour Skipper in my own way. Walk his favourite walk and remember the good times, donate some food or toys in his name to an animal shelter. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something that you could think of. \n\nIm so very sorry for your loss x", "The loss of a pet is very difficult so NAH. Ultimately it is his dog, and he wants to deal with this the way he wants to, which is fair. His lack of attentiveness to Skipper's healthcare might be more out of denial and grief anxiety more than just not caring for him. However, after everything you've done, it is also fair that you would want to be there.\n\nCan you not see him off to the vet, meet each other halfway in that regard??", "He's the owner, just let it be. He's probably gonna start wailing and doesn't want to do it in front of anyone including you. Just let him. Say your goodbyes now.", "Okay, so it sounds like you\u2019re both driving Skipper to the vet\u2019s together, ask your boyfriend if it would be okay if you just escort Skipper into the room with him, and onto the table, give him a last kiss and cuddle, and then leave Jeff to be alone with Skipper for the actual final moments. \n\nThat\u2019s what my parents used to do when I was a child and we had to have a pet put to sleep. They weren\u2019t sure I was ready to actually see the last part, so I was just allowed to help get them comfortable, and say a goodbye. Now of course you\u2019re an adult and could handle the rest, but if Jeff wants to be alone with Skipper for the final part I think this is a good compromise for respecting that, giving you each a chance to have a last moment with a dog you obviously both love so much. \n\nI hope Jeff can agree, because I feel very much for you. You may not have been there for all of Skipper\u2019s life, but you love him too, being shunted off to the side hurts, like you\u2019re being told your feelings for Skipper don\u2019t matter. I\u2019m certain Jeff doesn\u2019t mean to hurt you, but his own grief is too strong for him to really see clearly right now.", "NAH. Grief is a wild thing. But you\u2019re definition not an a-hole for wanting to be there for a dog you\u2019ve helped take serious care of. I grow attached to animals I just meet, let alone ones I spend that kind of dedicated rime with. Whatever happens, I hope you can both heal.", "NAH\u2026.yet.\n\nEmotions are high in this situation, and I\u2019m sorry this is happening, it\u2019s very difficult to lose a beloved companion.\n\nI think you are both digging in, and in ways where someone does have to give, or you run the risk of damaging your relationship. You are specifying *when* and *where* you want to say your goodbye. This is in direct conflict of your partner, the owner\u2019s, wishes. \n\nCan you be flexible on the when/where? If not, why not? \n\nMy opinion is, it\u2019s a very solemn and potentially traumatic experience to put a companion to sleep, and as such I do think that deference should be given to the primary lifelong owner/caretaker of the pet. Additionally there are some social stigmas around grieving in public, especially for men, this could be the root of his grieving process.\n\nIs there a compromise that allows you both to have the space to say goodbye and grieve in the least traumatic way?\n\nI wish you well and my condolences.", "NTA Please make your own special time to say goodbye to Skipper and then let your bf go to the vet on his own. This moment is about Skipper and you don't want to create an atmosphere of anxiety for him. To be honest, Skipper will be fully alert while you are cuddling him at home and much less so once the vet starts the treatment.I know everyone grieves differently but if this were me, I'd pack my bags while the bf was at the vet. My heart would be broken at being treated like this. Clearly you love the dog very much and I don't understand how your bf could be so cruel to you.I have an ex best friend whose dog became my dog's best friend for 6 years. When his dog was dying, he called and asked if I'd like to visit to say good bye because he knew how much I loved his dog. At the time, we hadn't talked in over 2 years and we haven't talked again since then.", "I'm incredulous that he is this adamant about you not being at the euthanasia.

You've been wiping that dog's asshole and you're not allowed to be there to say goodbye? \n\nIf he did that to me, he would be saying goodbye to the relationship as well as the dog.

That just wouldnt be compatible to my emotional needs at all.", "yta. I'm sorry but no it's not your dog too. it is his dog and he chooses who is there. he is probably going to break down and he doesn't want anyone to see. you need to say your goodbyes before he takes him in. he told you what he wants you need to respect it.", "NTA! You have a bond with that pet, and the dog loves you, I think in this situation, I may be wrong, but I think the dog would like to see you one last time as well. \n\nI say fuck it and go, that\u2019s what I would do", "YTA", "YES! YOU ARE!", "NAH \n\nBut Jeff is listed as owner. Vet will not allow to be there if he says no.", "NTA but damn don\u2019t make this about you.

My heart dog passed on my birthday last year, and afterwards I remember being grateful that I was alone with her because I didn't have to worry about trying to handle it well or having anyone witness that vulnerability. It's awful losing a pet in any circumstances, but being able to do it on your terms (in OP's case, the boyfriend being the one to go to the appointment) can definitely help with the grieving process.", "Thank you very much, and I'm sorry for your loss as well. Ironically I was 20 minutes away from my birthday too, so I have extra sympathy for what you went thru on what should have been a happy occasion. The only thing that gave me comfort at the time was I know for sure the last words she heard was how much I loved her", "Info: Why didn't Jeff take care of Skipper when he was sick?", "I mean the dog is also yours in everything but the legal sense. You carried that dog up the stairs, hand fed him, cleaned up his literal shit and you even made appointments for the dog THREE times while the \"actual owner\" seemingly couldn't be bothered to care for his own dog enough to get him to the vet. But somehow that means nothing to your boyfriend, your grieving is literally so unimportant that you're not even allowed to say goodbye. I'm sorry, yes grief is hard but your boyfriend is being horribly selfish and a hypocrite because he is making the dogs death all about him and his grief.\n\nI don't know if I would crash the euthanasia for the dog, because that poor thing doesn't need you two starting a fight right as it's about to go to doggy heaven.

It's such a huge thing for someone to go through and if this is how he feels he needs to do it, then support him, be there for him just as much as you want to be there for Skipper.\n\nThis is a sad story, but my brothers dog, we had to get him put down, my brother was holding him, and as the vet put the needle in, Toddy reached out his little foot, and I reached out and held it. My brother has never forgiven me for that, now I know I did nothing wrong, I was just holding his dogs hand. But to my brother, I took away his \"last touch\" that the last thing his dog felt was my hand, not his (even though he was holding him).\nI know I didn't do it intentionally, but I feel awful that I ruined that last moment for my brother. It's not a good feeling at all, you wouldn't want to do something like that to your boyfriend, even though you love Skipper so much.

He wants it to be a private affair where he can hold his boy and say goodbye one last time.", "ESH, your bf needs to realize that you care for his dog every day, and letting you say a proper goodbye is the least he can do. You cannot 'crash' this appointment. It's rude, assholeish behavior. But you need to tell him how even though he is the owner you are also a carer for the dog and consider Skipper family and how much not saying goodbye would hurt you. \n\nIt's also important to note that you'll end up having trouble bonding with any future pets, family or friends he introduces you to, as apparently he doesn't value you bonding with them, doesn't consider you and will end up disregarding your feelings.", "I don\u2019t know. My husband was in the room when my family cat was supposed to be euthanized. I didn\u2019t want him to come, but he wanted to support me and I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings. It was weird for this random person to be there with my brothers and my dad and I figured they were probably uncomfortable and not able to show their true emotions. I was angry with my husband.

It's commendable you have always been there for the dog and adopted him as your own, but if I read this correctly the dog has been with him nine years. It is his dog. And it is his decision. You threatening to intrude whether or not he wants to is what makes you the AH. \n\nYou crossed a line in saying that. A big line.

If BF didn't have the compassion to care for his dog in his end life stages I fear he may just drop Skipper off at the vet and walk away. Poor doggo will be without any one and so scared. \nGo. Go for yourself and go for Skipper.", "NTA. He was fine accepting your help looking after his dog for months, but now he wants to cut you out? Hell no. What a selfish AH. If he ever gets another pet again, NEVER lift a finger to help. And be sure to bring this up every time he asks.", "NTA this would be a deal breaker for me. \nGrief may be different for people but that\u2019s like not letting a step parent be there when the other parent takes a child off life support when the second bio parent isn\u2019t there either.", "NTA. I can see why he wants to be alone but if anything that moment together would strengthen y\u2019all\u2019s relationship imo. It is ur dog too and you have every right to be there, but it would be more respectful to say ur goodbye at the table and then leave ur bf and skipper alone together if he wants that vulnerable moment alone. I hope you both heal well from this, however what happens when y\u2019all get a dog together? Would that be his dog? And would he not allow you to say goodbye if, god forbid, that happens again? That\u2019s not ok, as you have every right since you\u2019re his main caretaker, and it\u2019s just emotionally not fair to you. You\u2019re both experiencing a loss and you both should be able to grieve how you both feel is right.", "Might be controversial but NTA. You\u2019ve been carrying this dog up the stairs every night while he\u2019s been ill, taken him to the appointments, cleaned his messes, you\u2019ve been the main caretaker of this dog during his illness while his owner sat in denial. He wouldn\u2019t even had known how bad it really was for the dog had you not insisted he got care. \n\nThis would absolutely be a dealbreaker for me and if he forced me to not be there I would not be there when he got home. How dare he rest the responsibility of care taking on you for months then deny you closure. What a selfish selfish man. He didn\u2019t care enough when the dog was sick but now it\u2019s the end suddenly he cuts you out? I probably wouldn\u2019t crash the euthanasia as the vets won\u2019t let you in but I would no longer be in a relationship that would gatekeep a loss of a beloved pet.", "NTA\n\nIf it's not your dog why has he been letting you take care of him? He can't use you for all the difficult caretaking and then exclude you in saying goodbye. I'd be breaking up with him over this.", "Rather than crash the appt, break up with this heartless fool.\n\nOf course, you are bonded with Skipper.  If Jeff can't understand that, he is cruel.  He has made Skipper's passing about Himself only.  He is the only one who has the right to grieve for Skipper.\n\nHe is heartless and a fool.  He is a fool for losing someone who was was so loving and caring to his pet.", "I'm a mean, petty bitch, so when Jeff comes home all sad looking got comfort, I'd ice him out and tell him, it was your dog and your grief, you need to deal with it on your own. And not do shit to make him feel better.", "NAH.\n\nThis is hard. I know because I've had pets my entire life and was there for the last two to be put down.\n\nAt the end of the day, Skipper is Jeff's dog, not yours. He gets the final say who is there when it happens and if wants to go alone, that's fine.\n\nI understand you cared for the dog. I get you love the dog. But you are not the dog's owner so you do not get the final say, OP. It's hard to accept and hear but you do need to accept that.\n\nSay goodbye beforehand. Treat him to something special with just you. It won't mean any less than being there at the appointment.\n\nThen let your bf take his first pet ever to the appointment alone. Hell, maybe offer to drive them and wait in the care so he doesn't have to do the drive by himself.", "Have you looked into at home euthanasia? Would give you the chance to say your goodbyes and then you can leave Jeff alone if that's what he needs. It would also let Skipper be in a place he knows and is comfortable in for his final moments.\n\nAnother note, it's a bit concerning how Jeff doesn't seem to care about your grief. Now isn't the time to bring it up, but at some point in the near future I would tell him how his reactions have made you feel. Everyone deserves to grieve in their own way, and he shouldn't be able to prevent you from doing the same.", "NAH. They're never \"just a pet\".\n\nOffer to take him with Skipper, and assure him you won't gatecrash. Say your goodbye just that little bit earlier. That's all.

You are both emotional, which is completely understandable. I feel for both of you. People do grieve differently though. Maybe have a compromise. Maybe you drive them to the vet so you get to spend Skipper's last car ride with him. You say your goodbyes before he goes into the room. Wait in the waiting room. If Jeff needs you, a nurse can come get you for him. Be there for each other afterwards. When you both are ready, say goodbye to Skipper's things together. I donated my dogs leashes, blankets and remaining food to a local shelter after some time. \n\nI'm going to keep all three of you in my thoughts.", "Perhaps suggest to Jeff that you both go to the appointment. Explain you want to be there for Skipper AND Jeff and would like to drive Jeff home so he isn\u2019t behind the wheel afterwards.\n\nSuggest you go in and say goodbye to Skipper at the beginning but step out and give Jeff his private time with Skipper after your goodbye.", "This is such a great suggestion!!", "That's the right answer. Definitely NTA for wanting to say goodbye and this suggestion is a great compromise. However, Jeff's behaviour, even though driven by grief, is a huge red flag. You did everything for the dog and Jeff denies you closure. I wouldn't be able to look past that if it was my bf. Does this show the level of trust, love and maturity you want from a partner? This is not a suggestion, I personally would consider breaking up if my bf did this.", "You didn\u2019t ruin anything, your brother is just an immature shit.", "He\u2019s an immature, selfish child who has no critical thinking skills.\n\nImho he needs to become an ex.", "If I cared for my boyfriends pet for a very long time, have an emotional connection with said animal and then I get told that my grief is not important and I'm not allowed to say goodbye just because I don't own the dog even tho I participated in everything an owner would do, even made the vet appointment, then I would break up.", "Having someone else drive home is really important. Some tough drives home the last two years as our original trio of cats is down to one and she ain\u2019t doing too well", "It's \"not your dog\" but your the one doing all the \"dog owners job\" hard work an effort Into caring for the dog? \n\nI almost ALMOST want to say N/AH but honestly it's NTA because your boyfriend is 100% AH \n\nYES, he is grieving. But he wouldn't even be grieving if it wasn't for you (in a good not bad way) because YOU put forward the effort to \"save\" the dog.

It speaks volumes on how much you love that dog. As awful as this is, this is a great indicator for your relationships possible growth or decline. This shows you how he operates when dealt with a very painful situation. It's perfectly fine to want to grieve alone at some point but it's not ok to ignore your partners contributions and reject their attendance for a last goodbye. Build on this to see where your relationship should head to next. \n\nHowever, even with all that being said, I'm afraid he still has the final say over this for being the technical owner. It would be better off for everyone involved if you just said your goodbyes the night prior. As others have pointed out, you would not want your boy to see his 2 humans fighting before he leaves, right? \n\nThere's alot of sadness and confusion. I honestly don't think you should be the one to drive him, he needs to seek that elsewhere. I don't see the drive back home ending well at all, there may be too many emotional reactions.

The dog will be looking to you for comfort too because you've fulfilled that role in his final days.", "NTA - well, at least you know how he'll behave in any other moment of shared grief.

It was just the two of us for a very very long time and it felt like a piece of me went with her. I wanted to be alone with her too. The reason was that the best death for her was not drama and being sobbed over. It was laying in my lap in the recliner we always sat in while I stroked her head. I wanted that for her and I don't regret it. I cried when she was gone.\n\nPlease try to look at this as what will be the kindest death for the dog. Losing a long term beloved pet like that is a very personal thing. And I'm sure the dog loves you too but it is you BF that has been the dog's lifelong companion. Please try to respect that. I think you will regret it in the future if you don't.\n\nI'm so very sorry both of your loss.", "ESH. You're both being selfish. You can say goodbye without needing to be in the room and get in his grieving space. He shouldn't be invalidating your relationship with the dog based on property ownership.

Do you have a friend or family member who can drive both to and from the appointment?", "NAH\n\nI think Jeff doesn't want you to see him get emotional to be honest", "Soft YTA.. I get you\u2019ve been there for this dog while he lost his quality of life\u2026 but your boyfriend had this dog the dogs whole life\u2026 before you\u2026 and in my opinion that 100% puts him in the right to decide how he wants to put HIS dog down\u2026 you joined the relationship and loved the dog as yours too\u2026 that\u2019s beautiful\u2026But ultimately it\u2019s his dog\u2026 if y\u2019all broke up would you be trying to take skipper from him because you feel he\u2019s more your dog?\u2026 i would hope not\u2026 the same principle applies here\u2026 he\u2019s going through a hard time\u2026 and if he\u2019d prefer to go alone and say goodbye to his best friend\u2026 I think it\u2019s more respectful to your boyfriend and relationship to let him do that\u2026 \n\nI was gonna say n-t-a but when you started talking about you know the time and place you\u2019ll just go yourself\u2026 that\u2019s so awful to say to someone who\u2019s already processing they\u2019re having to take their dog to die\u2026 and they want to do that alone and now have someone who\u2019s suppose to support them threatening to take that moment away\u2026.in my opinion you\u2019re not more important here.. nor are your feelings.. it\u2019s overall his dog.. his say how he wants to say goodbye to his best friend\n\nEdit to add: Also before anyone tries to berate the bf for not making the appointments\u2026 this is his dog he\u2019s had his whole life\u2026 to have to start making the dire appointments that are gonna call his final moments\u2026 it\u2019s so hard\u2026 when our family dog was dying my dad refused to call vets or anything.. kept saying \u201che\u2019ll let us know\u201d but he was\u2026 I had to do the quality of life care and make appointments\u2026 but if my dad wanted his last moments with his boy to be just them\u2026 I would\u2019ve said my goodbye and let them take their final ride together\u2026 you should let your bf have this", "Yes you would be TA if you imposed yourself, bottom line is while you feel he is your dog he isn\u2019t, he is your boyfriends dog and \u2018all your experience\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean anything\n\nRespect your boyfriends wishes, say your goodbyes to skipper when your bf take him in.", "To me, this is such an obvious NTA. I really wish you can find a way to say goodbye to your dog (because, yes, to me, this is also your dog).\n\nAlso, I've looked at your post history and you've asked for advice a few months ago regarding your boyfriend's behavior. I don't know if it got better but are you really sure you want to stay in a relationship with this person ?", "NTA. You\u2019re boyfriend doesn\u2019t get a pass on this because he\u2019s grieving. He doesn\u2019t get to cut you out of it, and he doesn\u2019t get to leave you alone for it. \n\nPartners generally support each other in tough times, if the only support he offers you is this, and it isn\u2019t what you need he should be able to have a discussion before he starts accusing you of being selfish.", "NAH. \n\nGrief is\u2026 weird. It can cause people to act in unexpected ways. There\u2019s some info missing- by BF I *assume* you mean boyfriend, not best friend. But unless I missed it, it\u2019s unclear how long you\u2019ve been together. So it\u2019s hard to weigh in, not knowing how long you have known the dog, and how long you\u2019ve been with your BF. \n\nBut it might be less about him not wanting you to say goodbye to the dog, and more about him not wanting you there to watch him grieve. It\u2019s going to be an incredibly emotional and difficult situation for him, and he may just want to go through that alone. And while I understand that it hurts you and it\u2019s not ideal, it\u2019s not totally unreasonable, and it doesn\u2019t make him an AH. \n\nIt sucks not to be there to say goodbye, and I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s the position you in. There\u2019s no cushioning that blow. But I do think that in this situation he 100% has the right to privacy in that moment. He\u2019s losing his companion of several years. And as much as it feels to you like it\u2019s also your dog, your BF doesn\u2019t seem to agree. \n\nAgain- not knowing how long you have been together makes it tricky- but there\u2019s a big part of this that isn\u2019t related to you. They had a history before you. It\u2019s his first time going through the heartbreak of putting a dog down. And, looking at the bigger picture- he may not be ready to share that moment and memory with you. If you break up, he\u2019ll look back on this day in a year, 5 years, 10 years, and maybe he won\u2019t want to have you in that memory of those last few moments. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re a woman, and we tend to take those things extremely personally. But sometimes men just want to go through experiences like this on their own. It seems absurd to say this- but try not to take it personally. It\u2019s about him and his dog, not about you. You can choose to make a big deal out of that, or you can just accept that it\u2019s where he\u2019s at. I think a lot of men would go this route, especially if you\u2019re not engaged or married. \n\nA friend of mine went through something very similar. She had even been living with the guy (and the dog) for 2 years when it was time to let him cross the rainbow bridge. And as much as the guy loved (and eventually married) my friend, he wanted to go to the appointment alone. It wasn\u2019t a slight against my friend at all. It was about his love for the dog, the 10 years he had been with him, and not being ready for that experience of her being with him while he broke down. It seems weird to us as women- we want to offer the support, and we would want the support extended to us. But men are built differently, and it\u2019s a different tier of intimacy for them. When his dad passed nearly a decade later, 5 years after they got married, it was still hard for him to be open and share his grief. He did, and she was there, but it still wasn\u2019t easy for him to have her there and have her see him break down. \n\nAs much as it sucks, I think your appropriate place here is to say goodbye last night or this morning before they leave for the appointment. Showing up at the vet will likely have disastrous results for you, and I suspect he will lash out. Respect his boundary. Today isn\u2019t about you.", "Being there when my dog was euthanized was probably the most horrific thing in my life. Worse than losing parents and family members. Probably because I had to be the one to make the decision to make it happen.\n\nBut that said, the pain of being in that situation is not as important to me as making sure my dog was not alone when the time came. If Skipper has someone there with him that loves him then that's good. Your NTA but maybe a blessing you don't see the final moment.", "NTA \n\nBut OP? Jeff isn\u2019t a compassionate person.

My soon-to-be ex-husband REFUSED to go with me to put HIS dog to sleep. He was content to let the dog suffer and I had to be the bad guy and make a decision on didn't feel comfortable making, for the best of the animal. Duke was in pain, losing weight, and unable to walk more than a foot and a half on his own \ud83d\udc94 this guy just dragged the dog outside and down the steps, punched him in the head if Duke snapped at him out of being startled (the poor old dog was blind, as well.) I remember the day I drove this old fella to the vet. It was during the COVID lockdown here in Massachusetts. I had to stay in the car while they brought him inside. At that moment, I was glad I was alone, because I was ugly crying so hard my face was swollen. I had to bring my own dog, Sadie, to be euthanized a few years before Duke, and I was even more grateful to be on my own. It affected me even more deeply than Duke's passing. She was so relaxed, but I was an absolute mess. I was heartbroken. I literally collapsed into a weeping puddle and had to be helped up by the staff. \nI can see it from both sides. Neither is the AH, say your goodbyes before Jeff brings the dog into the procedure room. He is going to be absolutely gutted while he watches the life leave this animal that has been a huge part of his life. Try to have a calm conversation, explaining you understand how he feels.

I would let him go alone.", "YTA. Your boyfriend will dump you if you show up at that appointment (or at least, he's not likely to forgive you). Say your goodbyes to Skipper before he leaves.

A friend of mine went through this. She had been living with her BF for 2 years at that point, but he had the dog for a decade. It was the first animal he ever had to put down. The dog was a big part of his transition from college to adulthood. The experience was a big part of him saying goodbye to that part of his life, and he just wasn\u2019t ready to have her in that moment. He wasn\u2019t ready to break down in front of her. He took the dog on his own when it was time. And she understood. She loved the dog, too, but she understood. It wasn\u2019t about her, just like this isn\u2019t about OP. \n\nI understand OP\u2019s POV, and I understand her hurt and grief here. I truly do. But they aren\u2019t engaged.

She was there last night. It sounds like she was there today. She had opportunities to say goodbye to the pup. He just wants privacy in the room during those last moments- *and I understand that.* It probably wouldn\u2019t be what I would choose. I would definitely feel sad in OP\u2019s shoes. But I can understand wanting to be alone when closing a door that you opened alone. OP wasn\u2019t there for the dog\u2019s whole life- and BF & dog have history that she isn\u2019t a part of. And that\u2019s valid and doesn\u2019t make him an AH. \n\nMaking it about her and not respecting his boundaries on this one is a bigger relationship red flag than him asking to do it alone.

Without OP it sounds like this dog would be left to suffer with Jeff who would make no appointments and treat the dog like all was well.", ">He was perfectly willing to let her handle all the emotional and physical labor up to this point and is now denying her the chance to say goodbye\n\nThis. \n\nSorry OP, he is the owner but after this..I will seriously re evaluate your relationship with him\n\nFor myself, I would leave.. what he's done is totally unfair and totally disregard your feelings.. the bond you would have built caring for him and nursing him.\n\nI am sorry for you.. be strong but this is a relationship that is not on equal ground.", "> The dog is likely very attached to her as well.\n\nNot only attached, but Skipper probably has a different kind of bond with OP versus the BF. I've been the carer for many sick animals (rescue work), and while my dogs obviously loved my SO, I was the one they went to when they didn't feel well, I was the one they trusted to give them meds, clean them, fuss with anything that was hurting them. OP has been the one making this dog feel safe since he got sick, the dog trusts the OP to look out for him. He's going to be more confused and scared being separated from her. OP is NAH, the bf is a selfish AH, he doesn't care about how Skipper feels, he cares about how Skipper makes him feel.", "I haaaaaate having other people see me cry, it's the absolute worst to already be feeling shitty and then feel self-conscious on top of it.\n    \nBut when I had to put my cat to sleep last December I waited until my mom could be here with us, because she had loved her for years too and had the right to be here. So I can empathize with that instinct to keep it private, but he needs to get over it and recognize that he's not the only one who will be hurting.", "I'm even more concerned that he will chicken out in the end and refuse to be in the room, and Skipper will have to die alone. I feel like OP should be on standby to make sure that doesn't happen. Poor pup shouldn't have to die alone because dude can't handle himself.", "My mom dealt with me and my husband sobbing about our cat who just died very unexpectedly. I was holding him in my arms while my husband dug a grave. My mom held me while I held my baby and she said that in my 33 years that was the hardest parenting moment of my life. She cries about him too.", "This was my immediate thought. He is going to fall apart and wants to grieve as freely as he wants without having to feel other things (like embarrassment or restraint). It\u2019s an intimate, private moment and he wants to be by himself. Men are so rarely given the space to grieve unreservedly or not have to buck up and take care of others during a tragedy. I know it\u2019s going to be very hard on the OP, but it would be a selfless kindness to let him do this alone. NAH unless she crashes the vet appointment.", "Nah OP has been his rock taking care of a sick dog for months when he couldn't be assed to make an appointment or wipe the diarrhea off the poor sick thing. Now he's ripping the carpet out from under her and shitting on everything she's done for both of them and denying her closure at the very last second when he decides he wants to act like an owner again.", "It\u2019s not her job to be her bf\u2019s rock right now. It\u2019s her dog too, she\u2019s been doing ALL the care, she\u2019s grieving too", "Even if he let me be there I couldn\u2019t get over the resentment of knowing the person I was with would have never made any of those vet appointments or taken on the care of their suffering animal in my absence", "Seriously. I\u2019m not sure why OP would want to stay in a relationship with someone like this. His dog gets sick and he refuses to take it to the vet or care for it? And then has the absolute gall to not only dismiss OP\u2019s grief, but to deny Skipper the comfort of the *one person* who stood by him through his illness. I bet poor Skipper will be looking around for OP, wondering why they\u2019ve left\u2026\n\nAnd imagine if they have a child who becomes sick. Would Jeff avoid dealing with it? Would he be able to sit through sleepless nights with their child crying in pain? If he can\u2019t even be there for his pet, I\u2019d *hate* to see how he\u2019d handle a sick loved one. \n\nAnyway now I can\u2019t stop picturing Skipper feeling hurt and abandoned during his last waking moments\u2026 so I\u2019m going to go have myself a good cry and give my kitty some extra hugs.", "Yeah this would be the end of that relationship for me because Jeff is without a doubt showing that he\u2019s not a good partner in \u201cgood times and in bad.\u201d I understand some men are fragile and don\u2019t like to cry in front of people but by the double whammy of not being a responsible pet parent and being selfish about these last moments with the dog would just be a complete relationship ending turn off for me.", "Yeah I\u2019m a crazy pet person so this is breakup worthy for me.", "I always hate when people on Reddit suggest breaking up, but this time, I agree. I can\u2019t imagine being with someone who\u2019s so callous. I\u2019d never be able to look at them the same way after this.", "They have been together long enough for her being the one taking care of the dog throughout the entire time it was sick. The bf didn't care enough to go to the vet himself, but now he's the one who matters most. Nah. By not giving the pup the medical attention it needed and not caring for it in the lowest moments he lost his \"right\" to make decisions alone.\n\nBut also, you do realise you are commenting under a suggestion for a compromise that would mean the bf gets the last minute alone, do you?\n\nEdit: typo", "What about the history OP has with the dog have that BF doesn't - y\u2019know, wiping his ass, coordinating all his care, tending to him in his dying daus?", "To SOME people. Some people, particularly men, need time alone to grieve and process properly.", "I'm a mean, petty bitch, so when Jeff comes home all sad looking got comfort, I'd ice him out and tell him, it was your dog and your grief, you need to deal with it on your own.", "Man, I'm definitely not wiping a dog's ass fox six months, only to be told that I didn't really love him enough to be there at the end.\n\nThere's no way that OP should lift a finger for any of Jeff's pets again.  (Although, obviously, that's complicated if OP is a SAHS or something, supported by Jeff to take care of this stuff.)", "And he's proving he won't do right by her already. I'm with you. I could never tolerate this!", "Right, I would accept it given the lack of any legal recourse.  And then just walk away from the relationship at that point. He's selfish af and will walk all over OPs feelings for the rest of their lives if she let's him. I would feel very betrayed being barred from that last moment with *our* pet, and never be able to  invest in anything emotionally with him again. \n\nOP NTA don't trust this dude anymore.", "I disagree. Sure, he deserves to grieve but his grief doesn\u2019t trounce hers. She\u2019s taken care of the dog, wiped it\u2019s behind, carried up the stairs, she did everything for it. I don\u2019t care how much of a banshee wail he\u2019s gonna let out, he shouldn\u2019t take away her chance to say goodbye.", "It can be very difficult yes, but you HAVE to do it, it\u2019s your pet, it\u2019s your responsibility, you agreed to own them and have them in your life until they died, you can\u2019t just neglect them when they\u2019re dying.", "Same. I am actually more heartbroken for skipper than for op tbh. It sucks for her, but it is seriously devastating to imagine skipper wondering why she's not there :( jeff is a major ah.", "It is possible though that he has been on so heavy denial that's why he has been letting OP do everything. Now he has to face the truth. Maybe he is also embarrassed he has let things go so far and wants to be alone because of that.", "We don\u2019t know BF\u2019s side of that story, honestly. \n\nAgain- I\u2019m not saying OP is wrong to feel hurt or disappointed. It\u2019s a sucky situation all around. But the idea that this is a relationship ending red flag is\u2026 a very Reddit opinion, and I\u2019ll take my DVs on that. \n\nBF just doesn\u2019t want her in the room when it happens, and he\u2019s allowed to feel that way. If the roles were reversed and a man was insisting on being there when a woman said no I\u2019d guess this would be going another way. \n\nPeople are allowed to have boundaries. And we don\u2019t get to decide they are wrong. It\u2019s probably not a decision I would make. And I\u2019d be sad if I was in OP\u2019s shoes. But I understand the BF\u2019s position, too. If he\u2019s had the dog for 10 years and they\u2019ve been dating for a year\u2026. I get it. I really do. Sorry.", "Completely agree. I don't know where OP is, but Laps of Love is a service that does this and is so so so worth it.\n\nI had to use them when my dog passed last year, and they were so kind. The vet that came to us was so patient, and gave everyone (even the other animals in the household) as long as we needed to say goodbye, and helped make sure my dog was calm and relaxed. My girl was able to pass in her favorite sunny spot in the backyard with her head in my lap.\n\nI think it was $200 extra compared to her normal vet's office - I know that's not something everyone is in the position to afford, but u/fluoxetinewriter, if you can, it really is worth every penny.", "Did this for my 16.5 year old cat who had lymphoma. She absolutely hated car rides, so the last thing I wanted to do was put her through that stress on her last day. Plus I knew I'd be a mess and would have a hard time driving myself home.\n     \nIt was expensive, I won't lie, but it was 100% worth it. She got to pass peacefully in her favorite chair.", "Absolutely. I learned about home vets in 2008, just before I had to euthanize one of my dogs, and swore then that I would always do that in the future. And I have, with both of the dogs I have had to euthanize since then \u2013 and fully intend to for the dogs I have now and those I will have in the future. \n\nEven vets who don't advertise that they make house calls will sometimes agree to do it for euthanasia, especially if they already have a relationship with you and/or your pet.", "I dunno.. we lost our cat before Christmas last year and none of us would have dreamed of pulling a stunt like the boyfriend is pulling here.. for me this is a NTA anyway. I do see the point regarding not stressing poor skipper out in his final moments but then again I think OP being there will be a comfort to him", "We used them when it was time for one of our kitties to pass, and the vet was incredible. She sat on the floor and asked all of us to share stories and tell her all about him. She pet him with us and loved on our younger kitty when she came to see what was happening. After he was gone, she wrapped him in a blanket and placed him in a wicker basket to take him away. It was all very lovely.", "Also look for non-corporate services in your area. LOL sold out a chunk of their business to private equity recently. There are lots of in home euthanasia vets with smaller, local companies or who work for themselves.", "They're with Gork and Mork now.", "Exactly. Like if I was OP I would honestly just go. Maybe be prepared to leave if the boyfriend gets visibly upset and you can tell the dog is stressed but I would be there for that animal.\n\nI would never dream of not allowing a partner in a situation like this, even if they hadn't been doing most of the care like she has.\n\nThis would be breakup worthy for me being honest"]}
