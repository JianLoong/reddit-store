We took him to the vet, they recommended a high-protein diet. When that didn't work, I scheduled Skipper again in Feb. My BF, Jeff, took him in and they found a \"volleyball sized mass\" growing in his abdomen. They were shocked at how large it was since there was no sign of any growth in Nov. The vet said he was doing well so we could take him home.  \nPresent day, he has lost a significant amount of weight, hasn't had energy, isn't eating, and his #2s have gotten very dark and runny. Skipper is Jeff's first pet EVER, and I've had animals all my life, so I am familiar with the signs. Again, I had to be the one to make the appt. because Jeff would not hear my concerns. However, he did agree to a \"Quality of Life\" assessment appt..  \nThe vet said Skipper is not doing well \\[he's had the same vet all 9 years of his life\\] and that she can tell he is not the same dog. So they called Jeff to ask him what he would like to do, and we scheduled an euthanasia.  \nNow, during the time that Skipper has been sick, I have been the one to take care of him. I've gotten him pain killers and soft foods when he stopped eating solid. I wipe his rear after his runny #2's, and I carried him up the stairs every night when he wasn't able to climb them anymore. I am home with him, hand-feeding him, bathing him, taking him potty.... I love this boy.   \nSo now the dreaded day has come and Jeff drops a bomb on me saying I will not be going to the appt.. I asked him if he was messing with me and he said, \"No, I don't want anyone there. We already talked about this.\" Which, sidebar, we didn't. I mentioned to him the other day that WE can take my car so Skipper doesn't have to ride in his truck's bed and Jeff said \"Okay.\"  \nI told him that Skipper is my dog too and I deserve to get a chance to say goodbye and that I don't need his permission. I know the address and what time, I can just go without him. He said that it is not my right to do that and it is his decision because Skipper is his dog. I told Jeff he is being heartless to which he responded that I was crossing the line and trying to make it about me. He said that I can't be there because that is how he grieves. And I said I can't sit at home alone and just wait for you to come back and tell me Skipper is gone, I don't grieve that way.  \nJeff got very frustrated and snapped, he said that it is Skipper's last night and it is not my decision because he is not my dog. I don't want to get in a huge fight when there are bigger things on our plate...but, I want to be able to say goodbye to Skipper because he's my dog too and I love him. On the other hand, Jeff is Skipper's owner. He has had him since he was a puppy and I want to respect his wishes.  \nAITA if I show up to the appointment to say my goodbyes even if Jeff doesn't want me there?....

This is a highly emotional time for you both and you grieve in different ways. \n\nI would suggest saying goodbye to Skipper before his appointment and letting Jeff go on his own with him. You have loved and cared for him, but I do think Jeff gets final say on this matter. \n\nRemember the good times", "NAH. This is such a difficult situation and it\u2019s obvious that your ways of dealing with this are so polar they\u2019re never going to come together. \n\nUltimately, I\u2019d respect your BFs wishes and let him go alone and have his last moment with his pet dog. \n\nWhat I would do though, is decide how I wanted to honour Skipper in my own way. Walk his favourite walk and remember the good times, donate some food or toys in his name to an animal shelter. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something that you could think of. \n\nIm so very sorry for your loss x", "The loss of a pet is very difficult so NAH. Ultimately it is his dog, and he wants to deal with this the way he wants to, which is fair. His lack of attentiveness to Skipper's healthcare might be more out of denial and grief anxiety more than just not caring for him. However, after everything you've done, it is also fair that you would want to be there.\n\nCan you not see him off to the vet, meet each other halfway in that regard??", "He's the owner, just let it be. He's probably gonna start wailing and doesn't want to do it in front of anyone including you. Just let him. Say your goodbyes now.", "Okay, so it sounds like you\u2019re both driving Skipper to the vet\u2019s together, ask your boyfriend if it would be okay if you just escort Skipper into the room with him, and onto the table, give him a last kiss and cuddle, and then leave Jeff to be alone with Skipper for the actual final moments. \n\nThat\u2019s what my parents used to do when I was a child and we had to have a pet put to sleep. They weren\u2019t sure I was ready to actually see the last part, so I was just allowed to help get them comfortable, and say a goodbye. Now of course you\u2019re an adult and could handle the rest, but if Jeff wants to be alone with Skipper for the final part I think this is a good compromise for respecting that, giving you each a chance to have a last moment with a dog you obviously both love so much. \n\nI hope Jeff can agree, because I feel very much for you. You may not have been there for all of Skipper\u2019s life, but you love him too, being shunted off to the side hurts, like you\u2019re being told your feelings for Skipper don\u2019t matter. I\u2019m certain Jeff doesn\u2019t mean to hurt you, but his own grief is too strong for him to really see clearly right now.", "NAH. Grief is a wild thing. But you\u2019re definition not an a-hole for wanting to be there for a dog you\u2019ve helped take serious care of. I grow attached to animals I just meet, let alone ones I spend that kind of dedicated rime with. Whatever happens, I hope you can both heal.", "NAH\u2026.yet.\n\nEmotions are high in this situation, and I\u2019m sorry this is happening, it\u2019s very difficult to lose a beloved companion.\n\nI think you are both digging in, and in ways where someone does have to give, or you run the risk of damaging your relationship. You are specifying *when* and *where* you want to say your goodbye. This is in direct conflict of your partner, the owner\u2019s, wishes. \n\nCan you be flexible on the when/where? If not, why not? \n\nMy opinion is, it\u2019s a very solemn and potentially traumatic experience to put a companion to sleep, and as such I do think that deference should be given to the primary lifelong owner/caretaker of the pet. Additionally there are some social stigmas around grieving in public, especially for men, this could be the root of his grieving process.\n\nIs there a compromise that allows you both to have the space to say goodbye and grieve in the least traumatic way?\n\nI wish you well and my condolences.", "NTA Please make your own special time to say goodbye to Skipper and then let your bf go to the vet on his own. This moment is about Skipper and you don't want to create an atmosphere of anxiety for him. To be honest, Skipper will be fully alert while you are cuddling him at home and much less so once the vet starts the treatment.I know everyone grieves differently but if this were me, I'd pack my bags while the bf was at the vet. My heart would be broken at being treated like this. Clearly you love the dog very much and I don't understand how your bf could be so cruel to you.I have an ex best friend whose dog became my dog's best friend for 6 years. When his dog was dying, he called and asked if I'd like to visit to say good bye because he knew how much I loved his dog. At the time, we hadn't talked in over 2 years and we haven't talked again since then.", "I'm incredulous that he is this adamant about you not being at the euthanasia. INFO how long have you guys been together?", "You say at the end that Skipper is your dog too, despite the title and the opening statement clearly identifying Skipper as your boyfriends dog. I get that you built a relationship with Skipper and you love him but you are overstepping here. Respect your boyfriend\u2019s wishes otherwise I see him becoming your ex-boyfriend soon after. He will never forgive you for crashing this painful moment. Do not force your will on a grieving man.

Obviously this is a tough time for your boyfriend, but if you've helped take care of the dog, it seems strange that your boyfriend would take such a hard stance on you not being there. It honestly seems really cold, on his part.", "NTA. It sounds like you live together? That makes it both of yours dog. You cared for the dog, went above and beyond.  You have a right to be there too if that\u2019s what you want.", "NTA.

And that kind of assholery has huge potential to end your relationship.", "Nta!\n\nWhile you may not be the legal owner, You've done a fair amount more than he has in the long run for the quality of life and care of his dog.\n\n\nThat man is more than  happy to have you care, clean, and love his pooch. You've been wiping that dog's asshole and you're not allowed to be there to say goodbye? \n\nIf he did that to me, he would be saying goodbye to the relationship as well as the dog. I would pack my bags while he is taking the dog to vet.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're losing the dog you love. He was lucky to be so well taken care of and loved by both of you.", "NTA for wanting to buy you will be if you do", "Idk if it's just cuz I love my pets so much but this would be a deal breaker for me. I understand everyone grieves different but this would be a huge red flag for me for how other tragedies would be dealt with in the future. That just wouldnt be compatible to my emotional needs at all.", "yta. I'm sorry but no it's not your dog too. it is his dog and he chooses who is there. he is probably going to break down and he doesn't want anyone to see. you need to say your goodbyes before he takes him in. he told you what he wants you need to respect it.", "NTA! You have a bond with that pet, and the dog loves you, I think in this situation, I may be wrong, but I think the dog would like to see you one last time as well. \n\nI say fuck it and go, that\u2019s what I would do", "YTA", "YES! YOU ARE!", "NAH \n\nBut Jeff is listed as owner. Vet will not allow to be there if he says no.", "NTA but damn don\u2019t make this about you.

My heart dog passed on my birthday last year, and afterwards I remember being grateful that I was alone with her because I didn't have to worry about trying to handle it well or having anyone witness that vulnerability. It's awful losing a pet in any circumstances, but being able to do it on your terms (in OP's case, the boyfriend being the one to go to the appointment) can definitely help with the grieving process.", "Thank you very much, and I'm sorry for your loss as well. Ironically I was 20 minutes away from my birthday too, so I have extra sympathy for what you went thru on what should have been a happy occasion. The only thing that gave me comfort at the time was I know for sure the last words she heard was how much I loved her", "Info: Why didn't Jeff take care of Skipper when he was sick?", "I mean the dog is also yours in everything but the legal sense. You carried that dog up the stairs, hand fed him, cleaned up his literal shit and you even made appointments for the dog THREE times while the \"actual owner\" seemingly couldn't be bothered to care for his own dog enough to get him to the vet. But somehow that means nothing to your boyfriend, your grieving is literally so unimportant that you're not even allowed to say goodbye. I'm sorry, yes grief is hard but your boyfriend is being horribly selfish and a hypocrite because he is making the dogs death all about him and his grief.\n\nI don't know if I would crash the euthanasia for the dog, because that poor thing doesn't need you two starting a fight right as it's about to go to doggy heaven.

It's such a huge thing for someone to go through and if this is how he feels he needs to do it, then support him, be there for him just as much as you want to be there for Skipper.\n\nThis is a sad story, but my brothers dog, we had to get him put down, my brother was holding him, and as the vet put the needle in, Toddy reached out his little foot, and I reached out and held it. My brother has never forgiven me for that, now I know I did nothing wrong, I was just holding his dogs hand. But to my brother, I took away his \"last touch\" that the last thing his dog felt was my hand, not his (even though he was holding him).\nI know I didn't do it intentionally, but I feel awful that I ruined that last moment for my brother. It's not a good feeling at all, you wouldn't want to do something like that to your boyfriend, even though you love Skipper so much.

He wants it to be a private affair where he can hold his boy and say goodbye one last time.", "ESH, your bf needs to realize that you care for his dog every day, and letting you say a proper goodbye is the least he can do. You cannot 'crash' this appointment. It's rude, assholeish behavior. But you need to tell him how even though he is the owner you are also a carer for the dog and consider Skipper family and how much not saying goodbye would hurt you. \n\nIt's also important to note that you'll end up having trouble bonding with any future pets, family or friends he introduces you to, as apparently he doesn't value you bonding with them, doesn't consider you and will end up disregarding your feelings.", "I don\u2019t know. My husband was in the room when my family cat was supposed to be euthanized. I didn\u2019t want him to come, but he wanted to support me and I didn\u2019t want to hurt his feelings. It was weird for this random person to be there with my brothers and my dad and I figured they were probably uncomfortable and not able to show their true emotions. I was angry with my husband.

It's commendable you have always been there for the dog and adopted him as your own, but if I read this correctly the dog has been with him nine years. It is his dog. And it is his decision. You threatening to intrude whether or not he wants to is what makes you the AH. \n\nYou crossed a line in saying that. A big line.

If BF didn't have the compassion to care for his dog in his end life stages I fear he may just drop Skipper off at the vet and walk away. Poor doggo will be without any one and so scared. \nGo. Go for yourself and go for Skipper.", "NTA. He was fine accepting your help looking after his dog for months, but now he wants to cut you out? Hell no. What a selfish AH. If he ever gets another pet again, NEVER lift a finger to help. And be sure to bring this up every time he asks.", "NTA this would be a deal breaker for me. \nGrief may be different for people but that\u2019s like not letting a step parent be there when the other parent takes a child off life support when the second bio parent isn\u2019t there either.", "NTA. I can see why he wants to be alone but if anything that moment together would strengthen y\u2019all\u2019s relationship imo. It is ur dog too and you have every right to be there, but it would be more respectful to say ur goodbye at the table and then leave ur bf and skipper alone together if he wants that vulnerable moment alone. I hope you both heal well from this, however what happens when y\u2019all get a dog together? Would that be his dog? And would he not allow you to say goodbye if, god forbid, that happens again? That\u2019s not ok, as you have every right since you\u2019re his main caretaker, and it\u2019s just emotionally not fair to you. You\u2019re both experiencing a loss and you both should be able to grieve how you both feel is right.", "Might be controversial but NTA. You\u2019ve been carrying this dog up the stairs every night while he\u2019s been ill, taken him to the appointments, cleaned his messes, you\u2019ve been the main caretaker of this dog during his illness while his owner sat in denial. He wouldn\u2019t even had known how bad it really was for the dog had you not insisted he got care. \n\nThis would absolutely be a dealbreaker for me and if he forced me to not be there I would not be there when he got home. How dare he rest the responsibility of care taking on you for months then deny you closure. What a selfish selfish man. He didn\u2019t care enough when the dog was sick but now it\u2019s the end suddenly he cuts you out? I probably wouldn\u2019t crash the euthanasia as the vets won\u2019t let you in but I would no longer be in a relationship that would gatekeep a loss of a beloved pet.", "NTA\n\nIf it's not your dog why has he been letting you take care of him? He can't use you for all the difficult caretaking and then exclude you in saying goodbye. I'd be breaking up with him over this.", "Rather than crash the appt, break up with this heartless fool.\n\nOf course, you are bonded with Skipper.  If Jeff can't understand that, he is cruel.  He has made Skipper's passing about Himself only.  He is the only one who has the right to grieve for Skipper.\n\nHe is heartless and a fool.  He is a fool for losing someone who was was so loving and caring to his pet.", "I'm a mean, petty bitch, so when Jeff comes home all sad looking got comfort, I'd ice him out and tell him, it was your dog and your grief, you need to deal with it on your own. And not do shit to make him feel better.", "NAH.\n\nThis is hard. I know because I've had pets my entire life and was there for the last two to be put down.\n\nAt the end of the day, Skipper is Jeff's dog, not yours. He gets the final say who is there when it happens and if wants to go alone, that's fine.\n\nI understand you cared for the dog. I get you love the dog. But you are not the dog's owner so you do not get the final say, OP. It's hard to accept and hear but you do need to accept that.\n\nSay goodbye beforehand. Treat him to something special with just you. It won't mean any less than being there at the appointment.\n\nThen let your bf take his first pet ever to the appointment alone. Hell, maybe offer to drive them and wait in the care so he doesn't have to do the drive by himself.", "Have you looked into at home euthanasia? Would give you the chance to say your goodbyes and then you can leave Jeff alone if that's what he needs. It would also let Skipper be in a place he knows and is comfortable in for his final moments.\n\nAnother note, it's a bit concerning how Jeff doesn't seem to care about your grief. Now isn't the time to bring it up, but at some point in the near future I would tell him how his reactions have made you feel. Everyone deserves to grieve in their own way, and he shouldn't be able to prevent you from doing the same.", "NAH. They're never \"just a pet\".\n\nOffer to take him with Skipper, and assure him you won't gatecrash. Say your goodbye just that little bit earlier. That's all.

See you on the other side Skipper, you've been a good boy \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude22\n\nThen say your goodbyes to Jeff....", "NAH. I can't judge either of you as an AH. This is a heartbreaking time. You are both emotional, which is completely understandable. I feel for both of you. People do grieve differently though. Maybe have a compromise. Maybe you drive them to the vet so you get to spend Skipper's last car ride with him. You say your goodbyes before he goes into the room. Wait in the waiting room. If Jeff needs you, a nurse can come get you for him. Be there for each other afterwards. When you both are ready, say goodbye to Skipper's things together. I donated my dogs leashes, blankets and remaining food to a local shelter after some time. \n\nI'm going to keep all three of you in my thoughts.", "Perhaps suggest to Jeff that you both go to the appointment. Explain you want to be there for Skipper AND Jeff and would like to drive Jeff home so he isn\u2019t behind the wheel afterwards.\n\nSuggest you go in and say goodbye to Skipper at the beginning but step out and give Jeff his private time with Skipper after your goodbye.", "This is such a great suggestion!!", "That's the right answer. Definitely NTA for wanting to say goodbye and this suggestion is a great compromise. However, Jeff's behaviour, even though driven by grief, is a huge red flag. You did everything for the dog and Jeff denies you closure. I wouldn't be able to look past that if it was my bf. Does this show the level of trust, love and maturity you want from a partner? This is not a suggestion, I personally would consider breaking up if my bf did this.", "You didn\u2019t ruin anything, your brother is just an immature shit.", "He\u2019s an immature, selfish child who has no critical thinking skills.\n\nImho he needs to become an ex.", "If I cared for my boyfriends pet for a very long time, have an emotional connection with said animal and then I get told that my grief is not important and I'm not allowed to say goodbye just because I don't own the dog even tho I participated in everything an owner would do, even made the vet appointment, then I would break up.", "Having someone else drive home is really important. Some tough drives home the last two years as our original trio of cats is down to one and she ain\u2019t doing too well"]}
