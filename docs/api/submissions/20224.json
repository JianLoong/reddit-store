We took him to the vet, they recommended a high-protein diet. When that didn't work, I scheduled Skipper again in Feb. My BF, Jeff, took him in and they found a \"volleyball sized mass\" growing in his abdomen. They were shocked at how large it was since there was no sign of any growth in Nov. The vet said he was doing well so we could take him home.  \nPresent day, he has lost a significant amount of weight, hasn't had energy, isn't eating, and his #2s have gotten very dark and runny. Skipper is Jeff's first pet EVER, and I've had animals all my life, so I am familiar with the signs. Again, I had to be the one to make the appt. because Jeff would not hear my concerns. However, he did agree to a \"Quality of Life\" assessment appt..  \nThe vet said Skipper is not doing well \\[he's had the same vet all 9 years of his life\\] and that she can tell he is not the same dog. So they called Jeff to ask him what he would like to do, and we scheduled an euthanasia.  \nNow, during the time that Skipper has been sick, I have been the one to take care of him. I've gotten him pain killers and soft foods when he stopped eating solid. I wipe his rear after his runny #2's, and I carried him up the stairs every night when he wasn't able to climb them anymore. I am home with him, hand-feeding him, bathing him, taking him potty.... I love this boy.   \nSo now the dreaded day has come and Jeff drops a bomb on me saying I will not be going to the appt.. I asked him if he was messing with me and he said, \"No, I don't want anyone there. We already talked about this.\" Which, sidebar, we didn't. I mentioned to him the other day that WE can take my car so Skipper doesn't have to ride in his truck's bed and Jeff said \"Okay.\"  \nI told him that Skipper is my dog too and I deserve to get a chance to say goodbye and that I don't need his permission. I know the address and what time, I can just go without him. He said that it is not my right to do that and it is his decision because Skipper is his dog. I told Jeff he is being heartless to which he responded that I was crossing the line and trying to make it about me. He said that I can't be there because that is how he grieves. And I said I can't sit at home alone and just wait for you to come back and tell me Skipper is gone, I don't grieve that way.  \nJeff got very frustrated and snapped, he said that it is Skipper's last night and it is not my decision because he is not my dog. I don't want to get in a huge fight when there are bigger things on our plate...but, I want to be able to say goodbye to Skipper because he's my dog too and I love him. On the other hand, Jeff is Skipper's owner. He has had him since he was a puppy and I want to respect his wishes.  \nAITA if I show up to the appointment to say my goodbyes even if Jeff doesn't want me there?.... I just want to be able to kiss my boy goodnight one last time.  \n", "created_utc": 1687331959, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f0kyh/aita_for_wanting_to_crash_my_bfs_dogs_euthanasia/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is a highly emotional time for you both and you grieve in different ways. \n\nI would suggest saying goodbye to Skipper before his appointment and letting Jeff go on his own with him. You have loved and cared for him, but I do think Jeff gets final say on this matter. \n\nRemember the good times", "NAH. This is such a difficult situation and it\u2019s obvious that your ways of dealing with this are so polar they\u2019re never going to come together. \n\nUltimately, I\u2019d respect your BFs wishes and let him go alone and have his last moment with his pet dog. \n\nWhat I would do though, is decide how I wanted to honour Skipper in my own way. Walk his favourite walk and remember the good times, donate some food or toys in his name to an animal shelter. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something that you could think of. \n\nIm so very sorry for your loss x", "The loss of a pet is very difficult so NAH. Ultimately it is his dog, and he wants to deal with this the way he wants to, which is fair. His lack of attentiveness to Skipper's healthcare might be more out of denial and grief anxiety more than just not caring for him. However, after everything you've done, it is also fair that you would want to be there.\n\nCan you not see him off to the vet, meet each other halfway in that regard??", "He's the owner, just let it be. He's probably gonna start wailing and doesn't want to do it in front of anyone including you. Just let him. Say your goodbyes now.", "Okay, so it sounds like you\u2019re both driving Skipper to the vet\u2019s together, ask your boyfriend if it would be okay if you just escort Skipper into the room with him, and onto the table, give him a last kiss and cuddle, and then leave Jeff to be alone with Skipper for the actual final moments. \n\nThat\u2019s what my parents used to do when I was a child and we had to have a pet put to sleep. They weren\u2019t sure I was ready to actually see the last part, so I was just allowed to help get them comfortable, and say a goodbye. Now of course you\u2019re an adult and could handle the rest, but if Jeff wants to be alone with Skipper for the final part I think this is a good compromise for respecting that, giving you each a chance to have a last moment with a dog you obviously both love so much. \n\nI hope Jeff can agree, because I feel very much for you. You may not have been there for all of Skipper\u2019s life, but you love him too, being shunted off to the side hurts, like you\u2019re being told your feelings for Skipper don\u2019t matter. I\u2019m certain Jeff doesn\u2019t mean to hurt you, but his own grief is too strong for him to really see clearly right now.", "NAH. Grief is a wild thing. But you\u2019re definition not an a-hole for wanting to be there for a dog you\u2019ve helped take serious care of. I grow attached to animals I just meet, let alone ones I spend that kind of dedicated rime with. Whatever happens, I hope you can both heal.", "NAH\u2026.yet.\n\nEmotions are high in this situation, and I\u2019m sorry this is happening, it\u2019s very difficult to lose a beloved companion.\n\nI think you are both digging in, and in ways where someone does have to give, or you run the risk of damaging your relationship. You are specifying *when* and *where* you want to say your goodbye. This is in direct conflict of your partner, the owner\u2019s, wishes. \n\nCan you be flexible on the when/where? If not, why not? \n\nMy opinion is, it\u2019s a very solemn and potentially traumatic experience to put a companion to sleep, and as such I do think that deference should be given to the primary lifelong owner/caretaker of the pet. Additionally there are some social stigmas around grieving in public, especially for men, this could be the root of his grieving process.\n\nIs there a compromise that allows you both to have the space to say goodbye and grieve in the least traumatic way?\n\nI wish you well and my condolences.", "NTA Please make your own special time to say goodbye to Skipper and then let your bf go to the vet on his own. This moment is about Skipper and you don't want to create an atmosphere of anxiety for him. To be honest, Skipper will be fully alert while you are cuddling him at home and much less so once the vet starts the treatment.I know everyone grieves differently but if this were me, I'd pack my bags while the bf was at the vet. My heart would be broken at being treated like this. Clearly you love the dog very much and I don't understand how your bf could be so cruel to you.I have an ex best friend whose dog became my dog's best friend for 6 years. When his dog was dying, he called and asked if I'd like to visit to say good bye because he knew how much I loved his dog. At the time, we hadn't talked in over 2 years and we haven't talked again since then.", "I'm incredulous that he is this adamant about you not being at the euthanasia. INFO how long have you guys been together?", "You say at the end that Skipper is your dog too, despite the title and the opening statement clearly identifying Skipper as your boyfriends dog. I get that you built a relationship with Skipper and you love him but you are overstepping here. Respect your boyfriend\u2019s wishes otherwise I see him becoming your ex-boyfriend soon after. He will never forgive you for crashing this painful moment. Do not force your will on a grieving man. Make your goodbyes before the appointment and let BF experience these last few moments with his boy alone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need his permission\u201d - yes, you absolutely do. Don\u2019t be THAT person.\n\nYWBTA if you aren\u2019t already.", "NTA. Obviously this is a tough time for your boyfriend, but if you've helped take care of the dog, it seems strange that your boyfriend would take such a hard stance on you not being there. It honestly seems really cold, on his part.", "NTA. It sounds like you live together? That makes it both of yours dog. You cared for the dog, went above and beyond.  You have a right to be there too if that\u2019s what you want.", "NTA. You having been caring for Skipper the whole time he's been sick so I don't understand what your BF's problem is.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I told him that Skipper is my dog too\".. he is NOT.\n\n\"and that I don't need his permission. \" .. You DO need his permission.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" and I want to respect his wishes.\" .. NO, you don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"AITA if I show up to the appointment to say my goodbyes even if Jeff doesn't want me there?..\" .. Yes. And that kind of assholery has huge potential to end your relationship.", "Nta!\n\nWhile you may not be the legal owner, You've done a fair amount more than he has in the long run for the quality of life and care of his dog.\n\n\nThat man is more than  happy to have you care, clean, and love his pooch. You've been wiping that dog's asshole and you're not allowed to be there to say goodbye? \n\nIf he did that to me, he would be saying goodbye to the relationship as well as the dog. I would pack my bags while he is taking the dog to vet.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're losing the dog you love. He was lucky to be so well taken care of and loved by both of you.", "NTA for wanting to buy you will be if you do", "Idk if it's just cuz I love my pets so much but this would be a deal breaker for me. I understand everyone grieves different but this would be a huge red flag for me for how other tragedies would be dealt with in the future. That just wouldnt be compatible to my emotional needs at all.", "yta. I'm sorry but no it's not your dog too. it is his dog and he chooses who is there. he is probably going to break down and he doesn't want anyone to see. you need to say your goodbyes before he takes him in. he told you what he wants you need to respect it.", "NTA! You have a bond with that pet, and the dog loves you, I think in this situation, I may be wrong, but I think the dog would like to see you one last time as well. \n\nI say fuck it and go, that\u2019s what I would do", "YTA", "YES! YOU ARE!", "NAH \n\nBut Jeff is listed as owner. Vet will not allow to be there if he says no.", "NTA but damn don\u2019t make this about you. He has had that dog his whole life-just because you have a little time with him doesn\u2019t make the feelings equal.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
