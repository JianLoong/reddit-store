That's a big difference.  \n\nWhy are you wanting to uninvite her just because she would (understandably) not spend all the time with you at 7 months pregnant?  \n\nThis makes no sense.  \n\nWhy are you hurt and disappointed that she's growing a human and needs help from her partner?

You should want the people important in your life standing beside you. Their lives don't revolve around your wedding, and your sister has a pretty good reason for not being able to help out as much\n\nSecond, 6 months pregnant is quite a bit different than 5 months pregnant. And she'll be even more pregnant by the time the bachelorette comes around, so again, a fairly good reason to not want to do all the partying\n\nShe should be invited, and if she declines to participate in various outings/events, that's her choice.", "YTA \u2026you didn\u2019t have your 7th sister as your bridesmaid because she is too pregnant to commit to assist you for your wedding.

First of all, a month can make a HUGE difference in pregnancy, and it's kind of ignorant to think something your sister does in say month 6, she could also do in month 7.\n\nSecondly, she's not officially in the bridal party, she's willing to attend a group event to celebrate you.  Her husband and your fiance are not close.  They are on their second child, and likely past the stage in their life where they wanna do bachelor/ette party things.

And obviously it would have to be scheduled to make it work for everyone in the party.", "Most of the time bridal shops will book a longer appointment so the bride finds her dress first, and then they help the bridesmaids find theirs.

Choosing to opt out shouldn\u2019t be a big deal, but it also shouldn\u2019t be a big deal to have reasonable expectations of your family/friends.", "Yeah I think some people forgot that part.

Personally, I would have understood that not everyone can make every appointment. Demanding they must come to go wedding dress shopping is ridiculous.\n\n\nAlso, I don't agree with the above either regarding doing both bridesmaid and wedding gown shopping at the same time.\n\n\nI have been in multiple weddings and never even heard one appointment for both.\n\n10 people is a lot to bring.

I think now a days you can\u2019t even try on dresses at a bridal shop with out a previously scheduled appointment appointment.", "You\u2019re missing the point, it wasn\u2019t a demand, it was a requirement for being in the bridal party. They are very standard expectations in North America, and being open and laying out to it expectations should be seen as a good thing. They weren\u2019t saying they were dictating their lives, these are very normal things to celebrate a wedding. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to go see the person who\u2019s getting married pick out their dress, you probably shouldn\u2019t be in the bridal party anyways. The whole point is being close and caring about this person and wanting to help them with their special day.", "And I\u2019m saying that for a large part of NA culture is is customary to attend these events.

Why can\u2019t that be enough?", "NTA  - she is welcome to go for a trip for her and her husband, but I would make it clear that you will remove her from all group chats like your soon to be hubby did. While it is crummy for them to do that, don't let it ruin your weekend. Everyone else there will be there for you. Focus on that. Your sister will do her own thing. It is expected so don't stress about it. Are they being rude? yup. Does it need to impact your time? Nope. Have an amazing time in Vegas. Watch out for the many Elvis'", "You get an award for coming to a wise decision so quickly. Have a great time!!!", "If you were paying for her and her husband to attend, then you'd be in the right to rescind the invitation. If they are paying their own way, well, it is nice of her to have her vacation coincide with yours and spend a little of the time with you but it is her money, she isn't in the wedding party, and doesn't really owe you her presence (which, she probably is too pregnant for in reality, a month is a huge difference in pregnancy)."]}
