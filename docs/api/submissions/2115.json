Sounds like he can't wrap his head around the idea that it's not disrespect but a joke between you and your son.", "NTA. Seriously he should not be anywhere around your son. Your brother can go stuff it.", "ESH except your mother and son - your dad was watching to criticise and decided to make a scene out of nothing based on a complete refusal to understand the dynamic between you and your son; but you could definitely have found better methods to deal with this situation. Losing your temper, swearing, and calling your dad names aren\u2019t exactly showing your son how to deal with conflict or rudeness in an effective way. Just asking your dad to stop yelling at your kid and to mind his own business if he couldn\u2019t speak kindly, and walking away if he refused, would\u2019ve been a much better example to your son, and would\u2019ve denied your dad the opportunity to create the drama he and you seem to need when you interact with each other.\n\nHaving said that: interacting with your kid by showing respect to the child in a funny and affectionate setting is a much better way to teach it than anything your dad seems to understand - so well done for that.", "NTA. But honestly stay out of my business/parenting decisions would have been a better response than going with calling his personality weird.", "First off, I want to start by saying you're doing great. Parenting is hard, and not everyone will agree with how you parent. \n\nI, too, went through a phase of calling my mom by her first name, and my kids did too. I also did the same thing you did of calling my kids by their full name. Now, as teenagers, they'll sometimes call me \"dude\" or \"bro\" as a joke and I do the same to them. \n\nYour dad is out of line of judging you so harshly, especially for something so small. As parents we should be supportive of our kids, even if we don't always agree with it. You're the adult and you're the parent your father has to respect that. NTA.", "NTA, I hope you and your dad can talk this out, but it's getting late for that", "Eh, on the line b/c calling him weird was both generalized and unhelpful.  Your brother is correct that addressing the exact issue would have been better.  But it sounds like your frustration is cumulative and your father pushes, and you- being human- snapped, so just into NTA for that reason.  P.S.  I call my son by funny nicknames and my co-parent doesn't always love that, but oh well.", "NTA\n\nBut your dad had you when he was 40, sounds like he was afraid of you making some of his mistakes, and his style reflected that. This is the downside of having regrets, you can unknowingly put pressure on your kids but you think you're saving them.\n\nYou sound like you're being the opposite kind of dad to your son, and that's a good way to try to deal with the shortcomings you saw in him.\n\nIs it worth having a proper conversation with him? Maybe. So he knows that you are trying to be a good dad to your kid, and the way you're going to do that is through love, laughter and support - the dream combo for a good parent lol. Maybe he understands where you're coming from, maybe he remains stubborn. That's not on you.\n\nTell him your boundaries when it comes to your kid - he doesn't get to discipline him, or yell at him, he comes to you with complaints rather than directly convey it to your kid, etc.", "NTA, you already told your dad he was out of line scolding your son for something you had no issue with. If your father can't respect that boundary, he needs to deal with the consequences. \n\nHowever, I'd urge you to explore your feelings towards him a bit more. \"Weird\" is such an ambiguous term -- it leaves great room for interpretation on his end too. If you're comfortable taking the time to articulate your thoughts towards him in more concrete terms, it may give you more insight and could also give him direction to understand where he's going wrong. What he does with that information is on him -- if he's smart, he'll try doing better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

(Well, ESH to include your dad but let me explain how YTA first). \n\nIs this really how you want to teach your son conflict resolution? When he grows older and has a disagreement with you (which is inevitable btw), would you want him to broach it with you using those same words: \u201cthis is why I don\u2019t like you, you\u2019re fucking weird\u201d? Probably not. (Man that\u2019s so harsh, it\u2019s got to be uncomfortable for any person present, let alone a 6 year old. Whether you\u2019re technically in the right or not, imagine how confusing it is to hear daddy talk to grandpa like that?)\n\nI know it feels like you\u2019ve butted heads about this issue several times now, but have you actually tried having a private sit-down conversation with your dad about this subject? Not during the heat of the moment, but later, when everything is calm and you can communicate your reasoning clearly? At least pretend that you\u2019re attempting to understand where his perspective is coming from, etc? I think you\u2019re still approaching your relationship with your dad from the place of being a hurt child, when you could be approaching it as an emotionally aware adult. I know it\u2019s not easy, but how much more would you convince your dad that you\u2019ve got your stuff together if you could tolerate his less-than-pleasant behavior with patience and maturity? You don\u2019t have to stand for any kind of abuse, and the bottom line is you\u2019re really not obligated to have any kind of relationship with your dad at all if you don\u2019t want to, I\u2019m just giving food for thought here about how you can better handle the situation should you choose to stay involved with him. **If you *are* making that choice to keep grandpa around, you do have the responsibility to model good relationship behavior and conflict resolution to your son.**\n\nIf I were offering advice, I think you need to privately smooth things over with your dad first, and then as a united front, you both need to apologize to each other *in front of your son*. Show him that both daddy and grandpa can still fight and love each other, and admit to each other when they\u2019re wrong. Or not, but don\u2019t act confused when your son grows up to use these kinds of words when he\u2019s going through frustrating relationships of his own, which may or may not include you. If your dad refuses to cooperate, then maybe that\u2019s another piece of evidence that you really don\u2019t want him around in your life as much. I also recommend looking into how to set healthy boundaries with difficult people. It\u2019s a skillset that doesn\u2019t come so naturally to us, and that\u2019s okay.\n\nDifficult moments are often opportunities to do the most impactful parenting.", "YTA.

You and your son have your own way of communication, something he'll always remember (even when/if he goes back to calling you Dad later). \n\n\n Only semi-related, but when said sir, it reminded me of the time I was out walking and my neighbor's kid (he's 6 or 7), was on his bike, he called out 'excuse me' from behind me so I stepped aside and said, 'as you were, sir' - and he slammed on his brakes to tell me 'My name is [name], not sir.'
