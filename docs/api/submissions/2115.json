Sounds like he can't wrap his head around the idea that it's not disrespect but a joke between you and your son.", "NTA. Seriously he should not be anywhere around your son. Your brother can go stuff it.", "ESH except your mother and son - your dad was watching to criticise and decided to make a scene out of nothing based on a complete refusal to understand the dynamic between you and your son; but you could definitely have found better methods to deal with this situation. Losing your temper, swearing, and calling your dad names aren\u2019t exactly showing your son how to deal with conflict or rudeness in an effective way. Just asking your dad to stop yelling at your kid and to mind his own business if he couldn\u2019t speak kindly, and walking away if he refused, would\u2019ve been a much better example to your son, and would\u2019ve denied your dad the opportunity to create the drama he and you seem to need when you interact with each other.\n\nHaving said that: interacting with your kid by showing respect to the child in a funny and affectionate setting is a much better way to teach it than anything your dad seems to understand - so well done for that.", "NTA. But honestly stay out of my business/parenting decisions would have been a better response than going with calling his personality weird.", "First off, I want to start by saying you're doing great. Parenting is hard, and not everyone will agree with how you parent. \n\nI, too, went through a phase of calling my mom by her first name, and my kids did too. I also did the same thing you did of calling my kids by their full name. Now, as teenagers, they'll sometimes call me \"dude\" or \"bro\" as a joke and I do the same to them. \n\nYour dad is out of line of judging you so harshly, especially for something so small. As parents we should be supportive of our kids, even if we don't always agree with it. You're the adult and you're the parent your father has to respect that. NTA.", "NTA, I hope you and your dad can talk this out, but it's getting late for that", "Eh, on the line b/c calling him weird was both generalized and unhelpful.  Your brother is correct that addressing the exact issue would have been better.  But it sounds like your frustration is cumulative and your father pushes, and you- being human- snapped, so just into NTA for that reason.  P.S.  I call my son by funny nicknames and my co-parent doesn't always love that, but oh well.", "NTA\n\nBut your dad had you when he was 40, sounds like he was afraid of you making some of his mistakes, and his style reflected that. This is the downside of having regrets, you can unknowingly put pressure on your kids but you think you're saving them.\n\nYou sound like you're being the opposite kind of dad to your son, and that's a good way to try to deal with the shortcomings you saw in him.\n\nIs it worth having a proper conversation with him? Maybe. So he knows that you are trying to be a good dad to your kid, and the way you're going to do that is through love, laughter and support - the dream combo for a good parent lol. Maybe he understands where you're coming from, maybe he remains stubborn. That's not on you.\n\nTell him your boundaries when it comes to your kid - he doesn't get to discipline him, or yell at him, he comes to you with complaints rather than directly convey it to your kid, etc.", "NTA, you already told your dad he was out of line scolding your son for something you had no issue with. If your father can't respect that boundary, he needs to deal with the consequences. \n\nHowever, I'd urge you to explore your feelings towards him a bit more. \"Weird\" is such an ambiguous term -- it leaves great room for interpretation on his end too. If you're comfortable taking the time to articulate your thoughts towards him in more concrete terms, it may give you more insight and could also give him direction to understand where he's going wrong. What he does with that information is on him -- if he's smart, he'll try doing better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

(Well, ESH to include your dad but let me explain how YTA first). \n\nIs this really how you want to teach your son conflict resolution? When he grows older and has a disagreement with you (which is inevitable btw), would you want him to broach it with you using those same words: \u201cthis is why I don\u2019t like you, you\u2019re fucking weird\u201d? Probably not. (Man that\u2019s so harsh, it\u2019s got to be uncomfortable for any person present, let alone a 6 year old. Whether you\u2019re technically in the right or not, imagine how confusing it is to hear daddy talk to grandpa like that?)\n\nI know it feels like you\u2019ve butted heads about this issue several times now, but have you actually tried having a private sit-down conversation with your dad about this subject? Not during the heat of the moment, but later, when everything is calm and you can communicate your reasoning clearly? At least pretend that you\u2019re attempting to understand where his perspective is coming from, etc? I think you\u2019re still approaching your relationship with your dad from the place of being a hurt child, when you could be approaching it as an emotionally aware adult. I know it\u2019s not easy, but how much more would you convince your dad that you\u2019ve got your stuff together if you could tolerate his less-than-pleasant behavior with patience and maturity? You don\u2019t have to stand for any kind of abuse, and the bottom line is you\u2019re really not obligated to have any kind of relationship with your dad at all if you don\u2019t want to, I\u2019m just giving food for thought here about how you can better handle the situation should you choose to stay involved with him. **If you *are* making that choice to keep grandpa around, you do have the responsibility to model good relationship behavior and conflict resolution to your son.**\n\nIf I were offering advice, I think you need to privately smooth things over with your dad first, and then as a united front, you both need to apologize to each other *in front of your son*. Show him that both daddy and grandpa can still fight and love each other, and admit to each other when they\u2019re wrong. Or not, but don\u2019t act confused when your son grows up to use these kinds of words when he\u2019s going through frustrating relationships of his own, which may or may not include you. If your dad refuses to cooperate, then maybe that\u2019s another piece of evidence that you really don\u2019t want him around in your life as much. I also recommend looking into how to set healthy boundaries with difficult people. It\u2019s a skillset that doesn\u2019t come so naturally to us, and that\u2019s okay.\n\nDifficult moments are often opportunities to do the most impactful parenting.", "YTA.

Older family members used to hate it because I started doing it sometime in high school. \n\nI picked it up because every time we\u2019d be somewhere and I\u2019d need her attention she wouldn\u2019t hear \u201cmom\u201d (she\u2019s hard of hearing) but she WOULD hear the nickname because it\u2019s what other adults call her", "He's a flying monkey. If relatives call me to tell me off, because my parents have taken the hump at something I have or haven't done, I double down. Why do siblings love telling you off for some perceived wrongdoing, when all you're doing is knocking the edges off your parents' shoddy behaviour? If they were challenged more, they might not think their bizarre opinions should be followed like some golden rule. \n\nI have worked with older people with dementia who shouldn't be driving and when we tell their adult children, the answer is invariably that they can't tell them not to drive, as their parents would be angry. No shit. But they might not crash their car and kill someone. Oh no, they might be angry and shout, that's far worse.", "Nope, he isn't. OP is NTA", "Agreed. OP should have told him to butt the hell out of his parenting methods.", "I do something like this when I\u2019m out with my dad. Shouting \u2018dad\u2019 has no effect so I use \u2018faither\u2019. That\u2019s not a typo, I\u2019m Scottish.", "Honestly the more I think about it, it's a good way to describe this kind of behavior to a little kid, without being inflammatory or resentful in a way that's burdensome for him.\n\nGoing out of your way to create problems where there aren't any, and being incapable of minding your own business, are asshole behaviors, sure. But yes, they're also fucking weird! Like, why would you do that?? Telling your little kid \"this behavior is pointless and hurts people for no reason\" is a much more meaningful lesson than \"this guy is an asshole.\"", "My mother has moved permanently into that category and let\u2019s be real\u2026 she\u2019s approaching being called by her first name real fuckin fast", "When me and my siblings are younger, We sometimes used to drive our mom crazy when we called her mommy because it reminded her of the movie mommy, dearest and it made it her feel like we didn\u2019t like her", "Just upvoted for the cuteness of trying to give a regal title to your dad", "The sliding scale of my brother calling my parents' by their first names from childhood because he considers it more respectful vs. me yelling \"HEY MA! PA!\" at the top of my lungs whenever possible bc I think it's funny. My parents were a little nonplussed by both at first but they don't actually mind.\n\nETA: At the other end of the spectrum, we found my grandparents' wedding book recently and you can read my grandmother's entire relationship with her parents in the way that she listed their gift as coming from \"Dad and Mother.\"", ">Sometimes I add embellishments so he'd be Sir Nicholas the first or something ridiculous like that.\n\nSeriously, this is so adorable, this is great parenting. \n\nAlso, your dad thinks it's disrespectful because he is one of those weird adults who don't think kids are people. They are property or extensions of themselves. \n\nYour brother got a different dad than you, so he can't be objective in this. Also, you did make it about his actions, it just so happens he has made that action part of his personality. \n\nNTA", "You could have told him off about that piece without insulting his entire personality. \"Dad i understand that you view it as disrespectful, I can understand that, but for us its a funny joke and I don't find it disrespectful. Do me the courtesy of allowing me to parent as I see fit.\" Not I hate your and you have a shirt personality. Thats not going to help him understand your viewpoint its only going to alienate and hurt him", "There are no winners in the asshole contest. Having said that, sometimes you have to be one because the other person is too dumb. Your father should not be yelling at your kid. You don't owe him an apology. You don't owe him anything. He clearly hasn't earned a real relationship with you or your kid.", "NTA. You are never wrong standing up for your child. Especially in front of him. That's how they learn you are always on their side.", "NTA , from reading here There\u2019s more to this story and maybe a few bottled up feelings, you stood up for your son, the Granddad was out of line", "He said he's been like this with him for his whole life, so I'm pretty sure that makes it his personality.", "He sounds like an awesome dad! And having a child at 22 is not that young. I thought he was going to say like 16 or 17. When my boys were little they would be constantly saying mom, mom, mommy, mom wanting things & one day I was so tired I jokingly said \"I'm not mom anymore so no more calling me that!\". Then they said, ok Cathy, go do this for me. I cracked up!!!", "Weirdo behavior for sure", "I'm sorry your father was that bad, but your comment still made me laugh because it's so absurd. (Plus, I have this mental inner voice scoffing \"father\" after a haughty sniff.)", "I did this with \"mother\" lol", "Yeah, I feel like OP could tease out a bunch of important stuff about how he was raised, with the help of a decent therapist, if he realized this wasn't his dad's \"personality\" per se, but more like a control issue.\n\n(Which could be described as his personality, but not the way most people would use the word most of the time).", "My mom also didn\u2019t respond to \u201cmom/mother/mommy,\u201d although her reasoning was \u201cwell there\u2019s a lot of kids and their moms around, it could be anyone calling for their moms,\u201d so I took to shouting \u201cMommy Lastname!\u201d when I needed her attention.\n\nEven when we were visiting family around a lot of Mommy Lastnames, only one of them had a child salty enough to blatantly call them that, so it mostly worked.", "I think most people think of the term \"personality\" as describing something innate that none of us can really control that much (without a lot of \"work\" on ourselves).\n\nOP's Father's behavior sounds like choices to me.  The choice to want to be addressed formally, the choice to butt his head into his child's parenting choices, etc.\n\nNow control issues, anger issues, etc can all be parts of someone's personality, but we also consider them pretty changeable, if a person really wants to and works at it, so while what he's doing could definitely be described as the father's \"personality\" I think people are responding to it's use by saying \"but your Dad could just chose to be different if he wanted to, so don't ascribe this behavior to some unchangeable characteristic that is just \"him\"...  it's not just \"him\", it's a choice he's making to be an AH\".\n\n That's my understanding of what people are trying to say.", "My mother thought \"mom\" was disrespectful (she preferred mommie - yes with the ie) so my sister called her Moe.", "Upvoted for being Scottish"]}
