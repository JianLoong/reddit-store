Fat kids are seen as cute, and fat older teens and young adults are teased and offered unending dieting advice. That being said being overweight there is not seen as a character flaw nor shameful the way it is here in the US. But none of that is an excuse for your mother to make you feel bad about yourself.  You have a right to ask her to stop talking about your body and to respect your view point even if she grew up with a different viewpoint about it. Good luck. Stand your ground and congrats on such a great weight loss journey!", "NTA- 5lbs and change every month sounds like about the right rate for healthy and sustainable, ignore them and keep doing what you're doing until you reach your health goals, you're doing perfectly :)", "NTA - your mom is being an abusive bully. When you called her on it, she fell back on gaslighting you and making herself the victim. Good for you for standing up for yourself, and I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re dealing with this.\n\nBtw - 5-6lbs a month is a completely reasonable and, more importantly, sustainable pace. You\u2019re doing an awesome job on your personal fitness goals, but please remember that your value as a person has nothing to do with your weight. You are the same awesome person at any/every size.", "NTA. You are doing freaking amazing- do not downplay that for yourself. \n\nCommenting on someone's weight is never constructive.", "NTA. She\u2019s a cruel person who doesn\u2019t care about you or your feelings. Blood doesn\u2019t make family, love does, and this doesn\u2019t sound like love. It is absolutely ok to go NC with horrible people even if they are \u201cfamily.\u201d I\u2019ve had to do this and while it seems that my dad will never understand, I can\u2019t let his other daughter screw me over anymore. You deserve better! Look how great you are doing! And amazing job standing up for yourself, I\u2019m sure it was difficult. I\u2019m sorry that your mom is an AH.", "NTA. i\u2019m so sorry this happened to you, youre doing great. your mom is very in the wrong", "Anytime someone says \"just joking\" they are lying. They thought they could get away with it, but your reaction was not what they expected so they back peddle. It IS what bullies do.

Totally NTA.", "NTA, but your mom sure is.", "Gonna hijack the top comment. I\u2019m almost twice your age and also here in the Philippines and I can tell you that is common as hell here. I don\u2019t tolerate it though. I\u2019m pretty low contact with some relatives so NTA for me.\n\nI\u2019m not a medical practitioner myself but since I\u2019m on a weight loss journey (health scare), I\u2019m rather closely monitored and advised by professionals. I have a shitton of tests late January. So, I can tell you with confidence that 5-6lbs per month for an adult male (a little less for females) is a healthy and more importantly sustainable weight loss. If you have a good diet and are able to exercise 3-5 times a week with increments of at least 45mins, that is fantastic progress, so keep it up. You can say an internet stranger nearby said that.\n\nI did lose more initially but that was due to medication and you don\u2019t want to go that route. Take care. \n\nHappy New Year!", "What is YT?", "Serious question: Are you allowed to tell an Auntie that they're fat?", "I'm a chubby white lady and have had random stranger Chinese aunties scold me - once for what I was drinking (an energy drink) and once literally looking through my groceries (we were both at a bus stop) and commenting on how they weren't good for me, etc.", "I hear this all the time and I wonder, what makes it acceptable? Can you also call them old? Or ugly? \n\nCan you tell your grandma she's fat, or just the young people?\n\nIs it only in the family? Is it done in company?\n\nDo upper class people do it, too?", "But OP is losing the weight. 5 pounds a month is a pound a week, which is recommended. They can't healthily lose it any faster than they're doing and needling isn't helpful. Weight doesn't come on overnight and it won't fall off overnight by skipping dinner either. Weight loss has to be a more long term process, during which you still need to eat. OP is aware they're overweight and doing something about it, and they're doing it sensibly in a way they can sustain for life.", "Thanks, OP's mom!", "Of all the ways you could have chosen to end 2022 on a positive note, you opted to support a fat shaming Asshole.

God, this. Don't fucking comment on it at all! Don't perceive me and my weight. Especially because every time my mom comments that I look like I lost weight 1) no I didn't 2) I just wear clothes that actually fit me 3) it comes off extremely patronizing and condescending.\n\nI wish people would just stfu when it came to weight.

Asian parents in general have a huge stick up their ass for body weight and have no problem insulting you to your face about it! \n\nThey see it as \u201cnormal advice\u201d but it\u2019s just mean. It caused a lot of issues between my mom and I too.\n\nPlease know you are doing your absolute best. You lost a lot of weight in a healthy way already! This is your own journey, I know it sucks to hear family saying that, but try to ignore it/ not talk for a little while and see if it helps her behavior.", "NTA. That\u2019s not constructive criticism. Constructive criticism would be be acknowledging how much you already lost and congratulating you for it, while also recognizing that you still have a way to go before you are no longer overweight. Constructive criticism also wouldn\u2019t be to keep bringing it up constantly, which your mom did. What she said is NOT a productive way to get you (or anyone) to lose weight.\n\nAlso: you lost nearly 30 pounds, and it sounds like you did so in a healthy way. That\u2019s really impressive! I\u2019m congratulating you for it, even if your mom won\u2019t. Congratulations!", "NTA", "NTA. I'm so sorry, OP. I've dealt with the same scenario, it feels horrible.

Congratulations on your weight loss, you should be incredibly proud of yourself, as I am of you!", "NTA - her behavior is wrong. She should be encouraging your weight loss, not belittling you for what you have not yet lost.

I thought you had lost weight, but I guess not.\"  At. My. Wedding.\n\nLots of jabs like that and I finally snapped at her that she thinks that anyone who weighs more than 100 pounds is fat and reminded her of several incidents of her comments.  She denied the wedding one, like that's something a bride would ever forget coming from her mother.\n\nDo what you have to do to get her to cut that out.  It's not a joke and it's not funny.  It's just mean and unnecessary.", "NTA Your mother is a bully, belittling you when she should be applauding your progress.", "You are NTA, but your mom is.

I'll bet you look great.", "NTA\n\nYou can lose a massive amount of weight by simply cutting Mom out of your life.

No offense, OP, but your mother is an AH.\n\nI would go NC for a while, completely ignore any communication attempts that do not include the word \"sorry\" with a valid explanation of why she is sorry.

That's being a bully.\n\nYour weight loss is wonderful, though I've come to realize that even with exercise (run 2 miles every other day, and go to the gym on the other days except Sunday), and a good diet, I carry some extra weight.

Well done on your very impressive weight loss journey (5.6 lbs/month is nothing to sneeze at!) and on standing up for yourself.", "All of this. Also I have to generalize but coming from an Asian family, I can say that this is fairly common. Most of the time we just let such comments on appearance slide but it can be pretty brutal.

Very hard to unlearn when you\u2019ve been eating a certain way for 20+ years. I lost ~30lbs after I landed myself in the ER last December with acute pancreatitis from an inflamed gallbladder, so at this point my body is clearly (rightfully) fighting me on my poor eating habits. Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, I did gain about half of the weight I lost back, which I expected since I dropped it so quickly from needing to make extreme changes.
