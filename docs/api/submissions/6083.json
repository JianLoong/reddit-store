Sorry your mom treats you this way. Anyone can see this isn\u2019t constructive criticism and you don\u2019t have to listen to her insensitive and disrespectful comments. Some moms need to learn that being someone\u2019s mother is not a pass to say whatever comes to their mind and disguise it as \u201cit\u2019s for your own good.\u201d This here is a prime example of how parents can induce their children to get eating disorders. Take care of yourself, OP, don\u2019t let her derail you; you seem to be on the right path of where you want to be and you should be proud of your progress.", "NTA\n\nyou are making progress that is what matters. You can't just drop off all the weight in a few months. That is not YT. \n\nIt is not a joke. Jokes are meant to make everyone laugh. People being rude and using the excuse 'it's a joke' are doing it so they can be offensive and make you look like a lunatic when you call them out. Unless it made you laugh, it's not a joke.\n\nShe is rude. Extremely rude. My mother did the same thing to me and called it 'motivation to make you lose weight'. It's not.", "NTA. Your mom had been fat shaming you for a fortnight, when she could have been encouraging you with your weight loss journey.", "NTA.  And no, she wasn\u2019t joking either.  And then she accused you of being the rude one.  Classic.\n\n\u2018why do so many moms do this?? Reduce contact with her", "NTA... she was being a bully. And you progress is impressive.  The gym workouts are great for your health. Even if actual weight loss has slowed, your body is getting more toned and that's even better then numbers on the scale. Well done.", "NTA! You have told your mom several time that you are working out and loosing weight. Your mom is the AH for always bringing up your weight and making jokes about it. The moment you tell her to knock that shit off she gets all defensive about it.  When people are being AH this always happens. Grrrr!\n\nHowever, I am not sure if saying you never want to see her again is acceptable or not.  I don't know. I am kind of a softy for forgving people once they genuinely \napologize and feel remorse for their actions. And also, I have made so many mistakes and have said hurtful things that I am very thankful to receive forgiveness when I am a butthead. I am pretty sure if I asked this sub to rate some of my flubs then I would be a sure winner for AH Of The Year award.\n\nI do know that what your mom has said and done over the last month is wrong. I hope you get an apology from her.\n\nAnd congrats on your weight loss. I hope you still kick ass at it and not let your mom derail your progress.

You are doing great with your goals, they have slowed because fat does weigh more than muscle, so it is common for the scale to not move as quickly at times. Don't be discouraged and you will get there. Your muscles are building up and that should help speed things up at some point. You lose fast, then plateau and lose slowly, then you lose fast again...it goes in cycles like that, so don't let that discourage you.\n\nFocus more on BEING HEALTHY than a specific number for a weight goal.

Laughing at someone, telling them they're ugly, and berating them for not being able to afford a gym coach is *not* a constructive way to help someone who ***already knows and is working on their health****.* If you don't believe me, here's a study published about how shaming actually makes people sicker and heavier - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6565398/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6565398/)\n\nand more info: [https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2017/january/fat-shaming-linked-to-greater-health-risks](https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2017/january/fat-shaming-linked-to-greater-health-risks) \n\nAlso, you say there's someone cultural at play because \"Americans shy away from calling out health issues\" but the OP is not blaming the healthcare system, or in denial about anything that would need a passive aggressive 'calling out' since again, *they're actively working on their health.* I don't see how this statement is relevant at all to this question.\n\nFinally, you're factually wrong that OP is morbidly obese - they are *obese* but NOT morbidly obese. This is not even the current terminology as used by the CDC and NIH, who use 'severe' at over 40 BMI, which the OP was not even at their higher weight.

I hope after some distance she is able to monitor herself better and you're able to forgive her.", "5 pounds a month is also really good and something to be proud of too!! OP is losing weight in a healthy way, which is also more likely to be long lasting. So don't undercut yourself OP it's definitely amazing progress!!!", "I agree, NTA. OPs mom is being hurtful with her constant digs at OPs weight then when confronted she is says she is joking? I don't think so.", "OP has sustainable ongoing weight loss, that's so much healthier than quick loss and inevitable yoyoing back as with fad diets.\n\nNTA OP and keep up the good work!"]}
