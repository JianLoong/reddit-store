It's exhausting at times and some take it farther than others.

You deserve better.  A healthier body is a great thing, but it is **your** body and **your** effort.  People who butt into your process deserve serious pushback.", "I\u2019m American. I\u2019ve always been a larger child. My entire life. My mother never made comments about my weight or hers until I turned to a teen. At least, I didn\u2019t notice it until then. \n\nI was in my 20s when I finally told her how much those kinds of comments hurt me. Specifically when she\u2019d tell me \u201c[She\u2019s] getting so fat.\u201d and it was honestly hurtful to hear her make those comments about herself and then me (\u201cI wish you would lose more weight\u201d.) etc. \n\nShe didn\u2019t realize that those comments were frustrating me and hurtful to listen to. She has severely toned it down since I told her a number of years ago.\n\nHer and I have both had some health struggles recently and we\u2019ve both dropped around 30lbs like OP.", "Yes, please do! No shame in that and no time like the present. As I mentioned I\u2019m no medical person and your circumstances may vary. Good luck out there!", "One thing about the new year is we celebrate these kinds of changes and resolutions! So sorry this happened to you and good luck on your own journey!", "NTA - continuously needling someone about their weight is cruel. I don\u2019t care who it is. It\u2019s not a joke or constructive criticism, it\u2019s bullying. I\u2019m so sorry she did that to you.", "NTA\n\nToxic people don't get to stay in your life just because they are a relative.", "NTA\n\n\u201cJust joking\u201d is wrong because if it was a joke everyone would think it\u2019s funny. \n\n\u201cConstructive criticism\u201d is not something adults give to each other unsolicited.", "NTA,  Her behavior is disgraceful.  I think your progress is fantastic!  Keep up the good work, and don't let her steal feeling good about yourself.  I'm sorry you are getting this crap from your mom, of all people!", "NTA- most people\u2019s weight flactuates as they enter adulthood. Your weight is your business, people need to learn to keep their opinions to themselves about others weight \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. I hate the Filipino mentality that telling someone they\u2019re fat is how you \u201cmotivate\u201d them to lose weight. If we want to change cultural norms, we need to take a stand against the toxic parts of our culture like fat-shaming. It\u2019s hard and it\u2019s uncomfortable but it\u2019s necessary.", "You are doing great, OP. And what she's doing is absolutely fat-shaming you and is unacceptable. You're NTA by any means, and when you don't see her for years, she'll realize where she went wrong, too. Good luck in meeting your goals <3", "NTA!!! Holy cow! Congratulations on your weight loss! Please don\u2019t let her ruin your momentum I know how hard it can be to not stress eat and what she did is stressful and hurtful! You feelings are totally valid! Stay strong!", "NTA, your mom was out of line. And you should be proud of your progress so far on losing weight.", "NTA \u2014 my mom is Russian and she behaves exactly the same about my weight. Last year I told her that if she makes one more comment I\u2019m done with her forever. Guess how many times I\u2019ve seen her this year. You guessed it, it was zero. I feel for you my dear", "Are you fucking kidding me!?!? This is who you choose to be as a person willingly? What do you think you did there? Did you think that was helpful? Fuck off", "She's lost on average 1.4 lbs a week (5.6 lbs per month). That is well under 1% body weight when starting at 240 lbs which would be 2.4 lbs starting out.", "Why. Just why", "You\u2019re mom is being very emotionally abusive. She\u2019s a jerk.", "Does she think you are unaware of your size? Then her \"constructive criticism\" is wholly unnecessary.  \n\nYou are losing weight at a healthy rate...so I say well done. NTA", "NTA \n\nNothing your mother is doing is constructive!\n\nMaybe start giving her cooking and \u201cwhatever she does\u201d some constructive criticism!\n\n\u201cWhy would cut all that without wiping down in between, don\u2019t you know about XYZ\u201d \n\n\u201cHave you ever heard of adding this\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friends mum makes this sooooo much better than this maybe I\u2019ll ask them for the recipe for you tk help you\u201d", "NTA, I hate when people get called out on being cruel they fall back on they were just joking and you're too sensitive which in the end they are blaming you for them being assholes. Would love an update.", "no point when you are still morbidly obese. its time to really take your mother's recommendation into consideration. but then again, if you are on reddit moaning you probably are resisting healthy advice. good luck.", "no, but i do pity her.", "thats exactly whats wrong with patients. when they insist that a bmi of 32 is really not that obese. lmao", "talk about complete ignorance towards health and wellbeing", "sorry about your weight issues. grow some skin and get out there and lose some weight", "I lost a lot of weight over some months, which I later found out was due to developing diabetes.  I hated it when people commented on my weight.  I knew it was happening.  I knew I needed to get it checked out.  I DIDN'T need people telling me I was too skinny and was there something wrong.  It made me so uncomfortable.\n\nAnd imagine if I had some other kind of illness causing it, which I had chosen not to share with people?  If I had cancer, for example, and people kept telling me I looked sick?  Yeah, not good.", "Keep talking", "It's also bad for your heart.", "NTA\n\nThere's constructive criticism and constant nagging about it. Your mom does the latter. And she refuses to change.\n\nNever visiting her again and going LC or NC with her in general is a great idea.", "HOLY!  If I were you, I wouldn't speak to her again.  Also great job on the weight loss!", "NTA. Go see your remaining relatives and friends, and do any planned important sightseeing or shopping. Then leave. \n\nDo NOT apologize to her. If she realizes that her rude fat-shaming insulting behavior has backfired on her, perhaps she will learn to curb her tongue around your siblings and at least they will benefit. Sorry you have such a difficult mom.", "NTA. Congrats on your progress. You're doing absolutely great. It is safer to lose the weight slowly rather than really quickly. The fact that you're working out three times a week is amazing and great for your health. Don't concentrate on losing the weight, just concentrate on being healthier and making healthy choices. We all are different body sizes for a reason. it's life. I'm much bigger than you at your heaviest and friends smaller than you and i have all sorts of issues because of poor dietary choices. I eat healthily and work out. changed my diet years ago. Only gained due to stupid shit lol. And now working on losing it permanently. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou'll be just fine. I'm so sorry that your mother is such a bully. Body shaming is never okay. That isn't constructive criticism. It's just downright mean.", "Being fat isn't healthy \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.\n\nYou're not going to change anyone's mind on this.\n\nPeople in your life that mention/notice your weight gain are surely pointing it out because they care about your health. You'd prefer it to be an attack on your self worth. So you can shut down and continue in your ways.\n\nBut carry on, eat yourself into the grave.", "lol", "NTA.  So, is it joking or is it constructive criticism?  It can't be both.  I am sorry that she is not admitting what she is doing.  Until she sees her error, there will be no change.  So, it is up to you whether you are willing to be constantly criticized as the price of spending time with your mother.  Do what feels healthy to you.", "I've been fat most of my life and I was subjected to these kinds of comments from family, friends and even strangers while growing up in the Philippines. There was a popular phrase people used when describing a fat person - he/she got lost in the kitchen. \n\nStrangers can be cruel, families more so.\n\nOne of my grandmothers who lived in the U.S. would always tell me how much weight I've gained or how fat I am whenever we would see each other.\n\nI finally snapped one day and told her, \"Why do you always tell me I am fat? Why do you never say anything good about me?\" Some of my relatives were shocked that I talked back to her. One said that old people just say those things and that I needed to respect my elders. In essence, let her insult me and just suck it up.\n\nI know many of them view it as \"constructive criticism\" and claim that relatives say these things so you could change for the better.\n\nOf course it's not true. And just because this happened to them when they were younger doesn't mean it is a \"tradition\" they must perpetuate.\n\nContinue on your weight loss journey and limit your contact with your mother or other people who are just vexations to your spirit.", "NTA", "I'm not arguing about whether or not being fat is healthy. But people don't bring up your weight because they care about your health. People who are fat know they're fat, they don't need to be told. If people brought up weight because of health, they'd bring up shitty eating habits and lack of activity with skinny people too.", "thanks!", "NTA in the slightest, OP, and a monumental congrats on dropping that toxic weight known as your mom.\n\nBe proud of yourself and your steady stream of HEALTHY weight loss cause losing it slowly will keep it off in the long run.\n\nYour mom will feel better when she drops that metric ton known as her shit attitude.\n\nHappy New Year!!!", "Definitely NTA. To make her really stop just tell her you won\u2019t be sending home any money or packages anymore.", "NTA\n\nFirst off, as someone who also struggles with weight you are losing weight at a healthy rate. My doctor told me that a safe amount is around 3 to 10 lbs a month, you are nicely in the middle there. \n\nSecond off, \"constructive criticism\" is not done by insulting the person, though I feel you know that. To do that she should rather say things like, \"I see you are struggling with X thing, maybe try Y thing.\" Something like, \"you seem to be losing weight well but you also seem worried about it, have you tried to take to a doctor to help you figure out more safe and healthy ways?\" Instead she is just constantly pointing out thing you have already told her or she is straight up insulting you. This is not okay.\n\nShe is 100% the asshole and anyone who knows what she has been saying and still asks you to forgive her is also an asshole. No one should go through that kind of abuse.", "NTA. \u201cI\u2019m sorry IF\u2026\u201d is never an apology. \nSounds like you\u2019re better off low contact and not dealing with the constant put downs.", "As a fellow filipina, I\u2019m sorry you have to experience that dumb part of our culture. I know it\u2019s meant to be some weird fucked up way to express tenderness, but it\u2019s still inappropriate regardless of intention. Impressive you dared stand up for yourself though. Only in my 30s did I start not giving a fuck about these comments.", "NTA, your weight loss is great considering your situation, MOM is an AH for fat shaming you.  She should apologize. Good on you for airing this! BTW she's NOT sorry for having offended you.", "Some of my friends also actually do this, not just family.", "Also Filipina and I am small and even skinnier when I was younger - I STILL get and got those \u201cyou gained weight\u201d comments. I think it\u2019s supposed to be some weird way to greet each other affectionately lol, so stupid.\n\nI\u2019ve just recently learned to pretend to not hear it and not acknowledge it when someone says it to me.", "Fellow elders are allowed to comment though, and they usually do by making the person a butt of fat jokes."]}
