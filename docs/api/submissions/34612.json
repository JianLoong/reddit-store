The 25th my parent and sibling (+siblings family) came to us, for the first time since 2019. They all live around 2 hours away.\n\nWe had decided to begin the 25th at 2PM, so we could prepare everything and rest beforehand. We had a long weekend with 1yo's birthday the 22nd, cooked the food 23rd, celebrated 24th and then celebrating again 25th. My parent missed the birthday (they thought it was the 23rd, even though the invite said 22nd) and when I called to ask where they were, they asked if they could come earlier on the 25th. I answered NO - 'cause our 1yo nap until at least 1PM, therefore we had decided on 2PM.\n\nI'm pregnant (week 37 at 25th). If I don't take a nap I get bad Braxton hicks for hours, which drains me and increases my risk for preterm labour. So every day I take a nap with our 1 yo, which usually ends around 1PM.\n\nAt 25th we put our child to bed and I set the table. Everything was prepared and I was just about to go and lay down, when I see my parent pull into the driveway. At twelve o'clock.\n\nThey come in, starts packing up food, tell my fiance to put it in the fridge and asks shocked if our child was sleeping. I said \"Yes, as I told you three days ago, they sleep until at least 1PM, that's why I said no to you coming early\".\n\nMy parent sat down on our couch with their phone, messaging and playing games with full volume, and sat there for 3 hours (sibling came 1 hour late). I didn't feel comfortable to take a nap, as it felt rude to leave the (albeit, for the moment, unwanted) guest alone in the living room.\n\nOn the 26th a wrote to my parent and told them that I didn't think it was OK of them to just show up 2 hours early, especially when I had told them no. I told them that I use our child's nap time to nap myself, to keep the Braxton hicks at bay. I said that I understand that they would want to socialise with us, that one perhaps want to leave home early to be sure you won't be late - but I also told them that they at least could have prepared us for the early arrival, instead of just showing up two hours early unannounced. \n\nMy parent just answered that they came early to help us with everything before the others came. They said nothing else, no \"I'm sorry\" or anything. \n\nA few days later I hear from a close relative that my parent has told them that I was wrong for telling them that it wasn't ok of them to show up early, that they just wanted to help, and that no-one ever should be irritated if a parent or sibling showed up unannounced - because they're family.\n\nSo AITA for being irritated at them for showing up two hours early unannounced, when I had explicitly told them to NOT show up early?", "created_utc": 1704737764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191rrr1/aita_for_telling_my_parent_it_wasnt_ok_showing_up/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As if it\u2019s new, whichever parent typically does the scheduling maybe starting to have memory issues, but be too proud to admit it.  If it\u2019s not new, then you are a saint for putting up with this for years.", "\u201cno-one ever should be irritated if a parent or sibling showed up unannounced - because they're family\u201d is fantasy/magical thinking that they\u2019ve now placed above the real world data they\u2019ve collected from you - that it absolutely was irritating. Especially considering all the other factors and boundaries you explained to them, that they completely ignored.\n\nYou should show up unannounced and raid their kitchen - blender, air fryer, microwave - and if they act shocked or offended by the lack of consideration - remind them that parents should never be irritated by helping out and supporting their kid. It\u2019s all \u2018yours\u2019 anyway right? They\u2019re just borrowing their assets from you in life until the inheritance comes through.\n\nWhat constitutes inappropriate behaviour changes from person to person, the way one couple speaks to each other could be completely unacceptable for another couple - some aunties might love being left alone with their niblings during gatherings while others may insist parents mind their own children - some cultures might expect you take off your shoes when you enter their home, while others would be offended by the sight of a woman\u2019s naked foot. \n\nThe point being inappropriateness doesn\u2019t function at all as your parents are selfishly trying to redefine it, entirely on their terms.\n\nThey need to offer respect and credit to people as individuals in order to have a chance at behaving appropriately themselves. You explained your expectations, it is entirely their fault for behaving inappropriately. \n\nAsk if their disregard for manners in people\u2019s homes is a sign of their declining mental states - and something the family will need to be aware of and prepare for in future.

They may have had good intentions - that's debatable and I'm not sure how helpful it is to sit on a couch and blast your phone for hours - but they didn't even communicate to you that they were coming early to \"help\" so that's not really help.\n\nI can understand being caught off-guard and wanting to be polite, but moving forward, you can't reinforce their behavior if you want it to change. \n\nNext time, I would tell them the timing and ask them not to arrive early. Then when they do, don't let them in. Tell them the time (again) and you'll see them in X hours. Then close the door.

We had a similar situation occur with my inlaws and it took several tries, but they now know that arriving early unannounced is unacceptable.

Again, already the AHs for that.\n\nThird, they didn't even TELL you they were coming early at any point. Triple AH score.\n\nFinally, after you told them it was inappropriate, they refused to apologize AND started shit-talking you behind your back?\n\nAH AH AH AH \u2013 they suck.

Its all a process, and you showing up early doesn't help.   Your parents weren't there to help, it seemed like more of a dominance move.  They didn't forget you told them not to come over early,  they did anyway. \n\nPeople showing up unannounced in general is BS.  Not like my place is party central or I have people knocking all the time, but I have stiffarmed the odd person who just shows up \"Hey Dude, thought I'd just stop by.  how have you been?!?!?\" then proceed to just try and enter.  Um... no...  I'm busy, I'm not busy it doesn't matter don't just come by.  \n\nmy unsolicited advice tho is. a) no reason to wait to inform them.  You tell them right then that it was not ok, and you had literally told them to not come over.  b) you grind into their faces the reasons you didn't.  And then should have told them thanks for putting the baby at risk and you having to deal with contractions all afternoon.  c) then tell them they shouldn't need to know the reasons.  \n\nParents, family, no one has the right to just come into your house, whether its early to an event you are hosting or just coming over unannounced at all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
