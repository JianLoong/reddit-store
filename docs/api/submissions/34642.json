I am one of the youngest of 7 kids. We are close but have had issues in the past. Most of my siblings are strong able bodied people. I am neurodivergent and physically disabled. I have lupus and a protein c deficiency. Because of how bad my illness is there are times I can barely move and my kidneys are currently covered in blood cloth. \n\n I have been betrayed by friends and it is hard to get people to help me. My husband cant alwaya help me. So I bit the bullet and asked my siblings to help me with chores in my house. My siblings are very into keto and holistic medicine. They believe it is bad that I take immunosuppressive drugs. But if I didn't my blood clots would not go away. Lupus patients are prone to kidney disease qne joint issues. I have both.\n\n So one day my siblings were going on how I eat badly and need to get off coffee. Let alone I drink coffee once a day ans eat more veggies, fruit and lean meat then them. my brother was telling me I had to cook with tallow and eat liver. my sister said to only drink tea. Then suggested teas that have just as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. \n\nI let it go because I assumed they were just worried about me. My sister then said \"I can't clean up this hoard you need room have two plates only two people live here.\" I say to her \" what about when I have guest over like my in laws?\" She then says \"use paper plates for them.\" I don't feel comfortable with that. \n\n I told her I am not doing that. She then said \"where are you going to put all this stuff?\" By this point I showed my sister where I put my stuff three times. I have a shelving area that I keep all my plates cups bowls utensils and more. My brother agreed with her even though his wife and him change out plates every season. But they act like just cause I needed help like my lifestyle and choices were bad.\n\n They went back to me getting off of steroids, immunosuppresants, and blood thinners. they both tell me it is not good for me and I just need to cut down my clutter, junk food and use homeopathic medicine. I then blew up and said\" just because I am disabled doesn't mean I can't have a normal amount of dishes. Just cause I am disabled does mean I need room live in nothingness. I am not going to eat like a  dog and I am not going to get off my life saving medicine. You are not my doctor!\" \n\n My sister got upset and started crying and I think this is where I might be the AH. My sister left and went to my mom. Her and my brother had told my mom I was unhinged and she called me. She knows what they are like but still asked me to apology and I said\n\n \" why should I do that? They don't listen to me and barely helped me. They want me to get off the medicine that is keeping me alive. Why do I have to always be the bigger person?\" Then my mom said \" because I raised you better than that.\" I just hung up and now they are mad. I have not spoken to them in two days and am starting to think I screwed up.

Intentions mean NOTHING. Your siblings know very well that they're using their \"help\" as a shield to protect them from anything they say to you, and they were quick to tell on you to mommy to use a figure of authority to reinforce their power over you the minute to rebelled.  \nYet they said everything wrong.

Not saying your partner is your caregiver (nothing wrong with that either, my partner is mine), but I understand what it feels like to have to rely on my partner to take care of certain chores. You are absolutely not out of line to ask for their help. So many people say they want to help but they really mean they want to influence you. For those who truly have the best intentions it is helpful to know what your needs are and how they are able to contribute. Asking for this kind of help is helpful in and of itself because it gives them a practical place to put their concern and love. Not saying your siblings don't worry and love you, they seem to, but they clearly prioritize their priorities for you over your own. This is not them being supportive. You are allowed to set boundaries and what you said wasn't even harsh, it was just honest. It is not your job to take care of them through their experience of your health. You are allowed to have joy, dishes, that bags you like, safety, and support without ableist and infantilizing critique. Often reddit gets it very wrong around Disability, ableism, and Disabled family dynamics.
