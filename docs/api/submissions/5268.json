I\u2019m 26, and single.", "NTA!  You are entitled to spend one on one time with your blood sibling!  Your step-dad's FIVE kids don't automatically come along with your outings!  Sure, sometimes it would be nice to include all the children on a beach or picnic adventure or other activities.  But movie tickets are costly, and it's a nice bonding experience for you and your sister to share.  Your mom needs to refuse to let her husband or his gaggle of kids interfere with the bond her children share!", "\"Even if we were all blood-related, I'd still be entitled to one-on-one time with the sibling I'm closest to. And there is a huge difference between having an outing with one person who is close to my age versus having a crowd of *seven people* try to see a movie together--at that point, I'd be babysitting, not having a fun evening, and I'd expect you to pay for all of our tickets. I'm not trying to 'exclude' anyone, I *don't* appreciate the accusation, and I think it's extremely unhelpful for the little ones if you start characterizing it that way: you should be teaching them that not everyone gets invited to everything and that's okay.\"\n\nNTA.

That's ridiculous and your mom should have completely shut him down and told him to get the hell out of your business.

That's ridiculous\n\nYour 'never had a step family' privilege is showing.\n\nThe step parent cares because by doing something with your own sibling, you are automatically saying their side is less important. It doesn't matter what the issue is, you must always defer to them, not complain when they get the bigger room cos 'reasons', never exclude them or do better at school or have friend groups where they are never invited.

Maybe I've been lucky but there was none of the jealousy or obsessive definition of fairness that was anything but fair. We just treated each other with respect or indifference and did our own thing.

It just makes better sense that you all go out together and build a relationship that way because your not a babysitter and you don't have enough to pay for 6 kids.
