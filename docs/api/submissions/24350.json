Remind your wife what kind of people her parents are.\nEdited: I apologize I had pronouns wrong.", "This... record the conversations somehow.", "*THEN, not than.", "The fact that they don't speak their language when his wife is around, makes a big difference IMO. It tells me they know she wouldn't approve. But when she is away, they do it anyway? Why?", "Yeah, this is a good idea. Learn some basic words.", "Yes, because it\u2019s so simple fluently to pick up a foreign language from nowhere in a few months /s", "Not necessarily, but it does depend on the situation. Speaking to your family in your native language is a habit that's hard to break. It only becomes rude in situations where you're doing it and actively excluding the host or because you want to talk about them behind their back like in this case. \n\nMy ex's family spoke a different language and would occasionally speak in their language when staying at our house. They were all fully fluent in English, but sometimes they'd still use their native language if say her mom and dad were just chatting when I was also in the room but not a part of the conversation. Same if were we all having breakfast or whatever and her younger siblings (also fully fluent in English) were talking to their parents. I knew they were most likely just talking about mundane things and there were other conversations going on so it wasn't ever an issue.", "I\u2019d record it and then play to the wife or someone else who knows the language.", "Heck, I think she only even needs to make it SEEM like she's using a translator app while they talk and they'll prob knock it off.", "Except then they would do that when his wife is around. Interestingly these urges only appear when she is not present. Obviously not a crucial fact AT ALL.", "Why? I have private conversations with my wife in another language when we don't want people to understand us. Privacy is not a bad thing. \n\nDemanding that people speak a language you understand is rude. Clearly I'm not talking to you, so why are you trying to butt in?", "Why do I need to speak English if I\u2019m not talking to you? If you\u2019re not part of my conversation there\u2019s no need for you to be in it. \n\nRemember they speak English so the OP can understand them,the OP only speaks English because it\u2019s the only language they know.", "Honestly it sounds like they never were trying to like him.", "Yeah but when her wife is around they stop... they are basically whispering and not to be trusted. If they were civil people and not judgmental it would have been fine.\n\nNTA", "Would you feel comfortable if people who were hostile to you regularly switched to a language you don't understand even though they also speak your language?", "Why should it be okay for her wife to bring up the issue but not for her?", "Or 3.

Does OP walk into their home fully ready to stop speaking English to avoid offending them? That's a really weird expectation.", "This was the first post that made some sense! It's such a difficult situation the generational divide between immigrant parents and it likely causes your wife a lot of anguish. I would already think youre the asshole for not doing everything you can to help her bridge that situation, but an extreme asshole for stopping someone from speaking in their native tongue. That's explicitly saying \"hey I dont want you to feel comfortable when you're around me\" whilst I will continue to behave the ways that make you uncomfortable.  (unclean house, unprofessional clothes) \n\"Only my perceptions of what is reasonable matter.\"\n\nThat's why I feel you are the asshole.", "The OP is not a man.", "OP is a woman", "Agreed it\u2019s a good idea to support her wife in her heritage by learning what she can.  Realistically, unless her language has roots with a language OP\u2019s learned before it won\u2019t change the situation with being able to understand two married native speakers chatting to each other with the absolute intent to exclude her.  They will run rings around OP.", "Yeah, this is an absurd advice... Just learn the language mate! It will be so useful for when you never visit your in laws in their country!", "Actually it is. But need to be compromised. I have been with my boyfriend (both speak English as second language), no classes or courses of any language. And both compromise to learn the language of the other.", "OMG, I was just about to suggest this!", "Yup. I had the same thought.", "OP is a woman..", "It is necessary to analyze the whole context, perhaps he has a bad impression because he is already on the defensive. That's why I said about giving the benefit of the doubt.", "In most situations? I would absolutely agree. Out in public with strangers, on the phone, whatever, have your private conversation.\n\nBut when youre in you SIL\u2019s (who you hate) house, and *only* talk to one another in the language he doesn\u2019t know, specifically when your daughter isn\u2019t around? That\u2019s so incredibly rude. This is a situational thing.\n\nAnother great example: you walk into a room. Your spouse\u2019s parents turn away from you and take turns whispering into one another\u2019s ears while staring over at you. Is *this* rude, to you? Because it is serving the same purpose, and it\u2019s just as blatantly rude.", "Context is key here - if they\u2019re only doing in front of OP to specifically prevent him from understanding what they\u2019re saying in front of him, then yeah that\u2019s super rude and there\u2019s really no explaining it away \n\nThe scenario you\u2019ve described is fine with random strangers, or if you\u2019re in a larger group and need to say something to each other briefly - but having whole ass conversations in front of one person who\u2019s hosting you in their home? Inexcusably rude", "because it is my home where you are a guest sitting like 5 feet from me. if you need to have a private conversation, excuse yourself and have it in private", "They may be the case", "why doesn't anyone read the post? OP is a woman", "OP is a woman y\u2019all.", "Her", "Which means....nothing.

If they were whispering, would it be ok for OP to demand to know what they said? It doesn't matter how OP feels, ultimately OP isn't entitled to know everything they say about her, whether she's there or not.", "If they\u2019re talking to each other in a conversation that I\u2019m not in\u2026 I don\u2019t care if they switch between 4 languages that I don\u2019t understand.

Is non of your business. \n\nIf I\u2019m talking in a language you don\u2019t understand how is that my fault? This is like saying I couldn\u2019t have a private or normal conversation with my family (our first language is Spanish) if my partner was around when we first started dating because he didn\u2019t understand Spanish.", "1.  It's not her parents.\n2.  She really has no idea what they were saying.\n3.  I wouldn't want my wife speaking like that to my parents without speaking to me about it first, and I would never do it to her.", "Keyboard warrior. Lmao. Get off my chirp.", "OP is a woman", "I feel like there needs to be more context actually, like is OP part of their conversations while they\u2019re speaking to each other in their own language and then speaking to him in English? Or is he minding his own business while they\u2019re chatting on the other side of the room? If it\u2019s the former, it\u2019s clearly rude, but if it\u2019s the latter, it seems completely normal for them to chat in their native language.\n\nAlso, is their native language also the language his wife is most comfortable speaking in? Perhaps it\u2019s not, which is why they speak English when she\u2019s around? They\u2019re probably uncomfortable being around OP alone because they don\u2019t have a strong relationship, so maybe they simply find comfort in speaking in their own language to each other when he\u2019s there but his wife isn\u2019t. \n\nI just think OP\u2019s post has a lot of paranoia and insecurity that is unfounded in actual evidence, and there\u2019s more context needed in general. Like did he explain why he wanted his in-laws to speak English around him, or did he just ask them with no reasoning? Of course that would come off as offensive to the in-laws, unless they genuinely understood why he was asking them to do that, and perhaps they all could have communicated their feelings better and come to an understanding with each other. \n\nBut instead OP refuses to be mature and apologize for the misunderstanding and have an actual adult conversation with the in-laws.", "It's a saying! Sorry, its an old european saying that understandably is frownd upon by today's society.\nNon the less, the point still stands in regards to learning the language.", "OP is a woman", "she", "Agreed completely. Situationally this is rude. \n\nI just don't agree with the take the other poster made that multilingualism can't be allowed around them.", "I've just got to assume all the people agreeing with this are not from multilingual cultures. I am from Europe where people switch between languages with friends and family all the time without having to worry that everyone around NEEDS to know what they're saying to someone else in a private conversation.\n\nIf I was a guest of someone who told me and my wife we needed to leave the room if we wanted to talk in another language, I'd consider them weirdly controlling and possibly xenophobic.\n\nNow are OPs in-laws rude and probably saying mean things? Yeah sure. Not saying they aren't AHs. But this \"rule\" that no one is allowed to speak a language if you don't speak it, comes across as weird and insecure.", "If I\u2019m not taking to you why do you need to know what I\u2019m saying? Is not my fault that you can\u2019t understand me but I can understand you.", "No evidence but it's suspicious as fuck. Enough to ask them to be thoughtful of her insecurities.", "He needs to get a translation app and see what theyre saying... what if they were talking shit?
