It'll make it easier on both of you if you have a united front.", "If they don\u2019t speak it when the partner is around but when they\u2019re alone with OP they\u2019re doing it as a play to piss off OP. Also learn a new language well enough to understand native speakers. Dude I took 7 years of Spanish but when a native speaker is speaking full speed I can\u2019t understand 80%. And especially in this instance if they are purposeful in trying to hide what they\u2019re saying they\u2019ll just speed up even further to make it harder for OP you\u2019re being unreasonable.", "Why is everyone reversing genders here? Haha", "\"Speaking to your family in your native language is a habit that's hard to break\"\n\nWhich would be fine, but they don't do it when their daughter is present, meaning they are undoubtedly taking advantage of the language barrier to insult op in her own home, which is unacceptable", "OP shouldn\u2019t have to wait to learn an entire freaking language to ensure that she is being respected in her own home. Should she learn the language to connect with her partner? To learn more about her wife\u2019s heritage? Sure! That sounds lovely, but learning an entirely new language so she can ensure that she isn\u2019t being talked about in her own home is, frankly, backwards. That\u2019s not why we broaden our horizons.\n\nInstead, OP, you should get a recording device and simply hit \u201crecord\u201d whenever they break into their native tongue in your wife\u2019s absence. You should allow both your wife and a professional interpreter to translate the recordings for you. I\u2019m not saying your wife would lie, but she may be tempted to omit some things that would make you feel badly in an effort to protect your feelings. \n\nIt\u2019s important not to wait you learn an entire freaking language to do this as you need to protect yourself and set boundaries where appropriate. You\u2019re being made uncomfortable in your own home, and they could easily be engaging in some very homophobic behavior if the comments they\u2019ve made in English are anything to go by. Depending on what the recordings reveal, it may be necessary to set strong boundaries with respect to your home (they can stay in a hotel), talk to your wife about the amount of contact you\u2019re willing to have with her parents, length of their stay, etc. Asking them to only speak English is, frankly, gauche; however, you aren\u2019t wrong for wanting to know if they\u2019re speaking badly of you or your relationship in your own home.", "Exactly this, while learning a language is always a net positive imo, op should not be forced into it by her in-laws just because they want to insult her in her own home.", "Learning a foreign language isn't \"simple\" for everyone; we all have different gifts.  Just like some people have naturally lovely singing voices, while others can't carry a tune in a bucket, or some people are excellent cooks, while others stick to microwave meals, some things come more easily to certain people (while others struggle).  To imply that something many people find challenging, even impossible is *easy*, simply because it is easy for *you*, dismisses those with differing experiences as \"less than\".  Which isn't cool.", "ESH with a touch towards YTA. \n\nTheir prob talking about picking their assess. Whatever. I don\u2019t know how comfortable they are with English but why force them to speak in a second language unless they are talking to you? It would be more polite but it\u2019s not rude. \n\nHave you considered learning the language? Your kids might want to know one day.", "They can talk about you anytime anywhere when you aren't there. What difference does it make if they're in your house? Go out for a while if you need a break from them. I hate to tell you but even straight couples have annoying in-laws. I mean, NTA, but never tell people they can't speak in their own language. That's being as rude as them.", "Didn't read. YTA.", "NTA, can you record what they say and get it translated also you have proof that it's bad things about you?", "ESH.  The problem is that you feel excluded when they speak their native language bc they are behaving badly.  I think it\u2019s reasonable to speak their language when speaking to one another, and you can\u2019t assume they are speaking about you.  \n\nAddress the real issue, which is their shitty behavior.  \n\nAnyway, they could be saying mundane stuff to each other, you can\u2019t force them to speak English around you.  You just can\u2019t.", "OP, just use the voice to text Google translate app on your phone. FFS Learn the language for your wife in your own time if you like, but why bother for people you don't even like just to see if they're talking shit behind your back? It's very easy to translate the audio and see what it translates to, if it's bad you can then review the audio with your wife and she can confirm if the translation is more or less accurate. You can then say that this is why you're uncomfortable spending the whole day alone with them in your home. \n\n\n If they're disrespectful to your face in your own home then no more home visits. They can get a hotel for a week next time. See how long they're willing to hang around and visit when it's on their own dime. If they complain who cares? You're never going to impress these people. Your wife is perfectly capable of having a relationship with her parents without you. Don't let them stay with you again if your suspicious are accurate and they are insulting you in their own language.", "YTA - dog hairs on the sofa? That's gross and you expect your guests to sit on that and get it all over their clothes? No wonder they're taking about you behind your back. At least put a sheet on the sofa for the dog to sit on which your parents-in-law can take off when they need to sit on a clean sofa.", "Your feelings are valid, they should be more respectful!  But it seems like they have made a huge leap in accepting you.  I think they are just role playing some of their previous prejudices.  Do some nice things for them and maybe compliment each of them personally.  They will come around!  \n\nHell, they want you to have kids!  Imagine if you did decide to adopt, they would surely accept and love you too", "My stepmom is from South America, she and her family speak Spanish in front of my dad and me all the time.  Some of it, I catch, some I don\u2019t.\n\nI would never assume they were speaking about me.  I just assume it\u2019s easier for them to one another in their native language.  \n\nWeird how people don\u2019t get how much effort is required to speak another language.", "Really. Lol.   How long do think it takes to learn a new language enough to understand a full conversation between native speakers.  More than a couple of days. \n\nIt's OP  house.  It's not like they can't speak OP language.  They are being totally rude.\n  If they and their child together have conversations, that's different.  They are doing it around OP like this to be sly.", "Agreed, I\u2019d let them talk in their native language, record it when I think it\u2019s about me and get it translated.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if I feel uncomfortable.  They can speak their own language if they want.  I\u2019ll live.", "Just reverse my words then, their genders mean little to nothing in this case.", "I think we are in agreement though, I was being a bit sarcastic.", "(chugging guitar sounds)", "Eh, they\u2019ll just talk about you later. It doesn\u2019t really solve anything aside give them more reason to dislike you.", "Info: How fluent are they in English? Can they express everything in both languages with equal fluency?", "ESH. They are obviously rude guests.\n\nBut you need to realize that first, it's quite likely that they aren't totally fluent in English, and there are a lot of things they can't express in English clearly and with nuance like they can in their native language. It's a type of gag order to make them communicate only in English. Second, it's uncomfortable and unnatural to speak a foreign language with someone whom you've spoken for decades to in another language.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to be upset at them, but then speaking in their native language isn't one of them.", "Why do monolinguals always think people are talking about them behind their back? Not everything is about you. Sometimes it\u2019s just easier to speak your native language, speaking more than one language is hard. Sometimes you just want to let your guard down and be comfortable around your family.\n\nYou have the chance to learn about a new culture and a new language, if you loved your wife fully, you would take this as an opportunity to learn more about her. Google translate is free my guy. If you wanted to know what they were saying, politely ask. If they\u2019re still trying to exclude you, express your feelings about feeling left out, but forcing people to not speak their language is rude. Trust me, if you visit them, they\u2019ll say the same to you. It\u2019ll definitely put a strain on your relationship with your in laws and your wife.", "Never have house guests for longer than 3 days. More and it becomes annoying even if you like them in my experience. \n\nYour in-laws sound awfull and I would say it's disrespectful of them to exclude you like that. Especially if there's a common language everyone speaks.", "You are not being an AH at all, they\u2019re being highly disrespectful to the man of the house. Don\u2019t apologize, I would (for ur wife) try explaining why you said what u said.  That\u2019s as far as I would go! Good luck!", "NTA, they\u2019re being rude by leaving you out, and likely talking about you.", "YTA\n\nFur on the sofa is dirty.\n\nYou should dress appropriately in front of in laws.\n\nAll parents want their children to have children.", "You think because youre a polygot you are exempt from disrespect? \n\nIf I'm in a hosts house then i speak the language of the host as much as possible. Odd exceptions of switching back to native to ask how to say something, not a problem. But for the most part you have the common respect to be gracious to your host. \n\nOP -NTA, sticky situation though, I'd have to sit down and talk to the wife, probably after they've gone with a \"listen ill do anything for you and if you want your parent to stop so be it, i really struggled with this time and i want to go through it with you so that we're atleast on the same page. \n\nPersonally if you have the vibes they're talking about you record it and ask your wife to translate but learning as much as you can of your wifes native tongue is defo the way to go.", "They might not even be insulting her. They could be talking about something irrelevant to her. What if they\u2019re talking about intimate details they\u2019re just not wanting to share? Sometimes I wish I wasn\u2019t bilingual because I need my in laws to give me some space. \n\nI think monolinguals are very self conscious about what they don\u2019t know and that can be scary, but sometimes it\u2019s ok not to know.\n\nI speak Spanish, my niece speaks mandarin. We don\u2019t always understand each other, but I care about her I want her to feel confident and comfortable about how she wants to express herself, even if I can\u2019t understand it. Even if she\u2019s talking about me behind my back, I\u2019m secure enough in myself to not let it get to me.", "*her", "This really should be top comment. Only, I'd record them then ask my spouse to translate for me. That way, she knows what the parents are saying and what basis she has for a relationship with them. But, then, I tend to be an asshole most days.", "I believe the bigotry being referred to is the parents\u2019 homophobia."]}
