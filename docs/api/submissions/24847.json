Or have you completely shut her out now that you have alternate childcare arranged?", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss. Just because your SIL has a key to your home, it doesn't mean she can abuse the privilege and visit unannounced as it suits her. It's your home and private space which you kindly shared with her to help you both get through your grief.\n\nIt doesn't sound as though you're barring access to your Son, but you need to agree on Boundaries which are acceptable to you both.", "NTA. Boundries are important, and she's not entitled to free entry of your house whenever she wants.", "Sorry for your loss.\n\nNTA.  It doesn't seem like you are trying to take away access to your son, you just want to build parameters around the visits.  Text your in-laws and let them know that you want your son to know his family, you just want to establish a schedule to avoid frustrations on all sides.", "So sorry for your loss.\n\nI'm on the fence here. On one hand, it is your house and your child and you are fully allowed to make those decisions for them, and I understand wanting more control over what happens in your house and with your kid. \n\nOn the other hand, the way you've described it feels a bit abrupt and a bit dismissive of her feelings. I can see how she would feel like she's been misled about her role in your child's life.\n\nMaybe I need more info: Did you try talking to her about when and how she could come over and spend time with your child? Did you try setting boundaries and she kept breaking them, or did she just assume she was welcome until you took her key? Are there concerns about her behaviour that make you not want her to have access to your house/child? Is this a ban from the house, or is she still allowed to come over when you're there?", "ESH.\n\n>she was disappointed that after she committed a year of her life to taking care of her nephew and rarely going out with her friends or living a life for herself, she wasn't even aloud to see him.\n\nYou suck for kicking SIL out when she means no harm.\n\n>I sat her down and told her that I was uncomfortable with her coming into my house whenever to see my son and I wanted the house key back.\n\nShe sucks for being intrusive. It's your house.\n\nEdit: Yes, I do believe there is more to this story. You guys all need to have a talk.", "I'd say NAH\n\nI totally get her wish to bond with your son more than she already did but I also get your boundries.\n\nI think another talk is due and perhaps some kind of visitation plan.", "I mean draw the boundary, but downplaying that time (her choice or not) is not very nice. You obviously needed each other. Just thank her again for helping with your boy, while reinforcing the boundary. No need to get mean about it.", "YTA, but I get it.\n\nHonestly, I think I lean YTA because it sounds like you were a bit heavy-handed for a pretty delicate and sensitive conversation.\n\nYou 100% have the right to do what you did and reestablish boundaries and expectations, but it feels like you did it like an asshole, tbh.\n\nFWIW, I do think it's a logistical mistake to take the key back. It's always good to have a local ally that can do a drive-by at the house for you if you forgot something for your son. Plus, it makes it feel like you don't trust that she'll respect the updated boundaries.", "YTA for blaming her for the decision to help you raise your son at your time of greatest need and then just cutting her off completely. There are ways to impose boundaries more gently and kindly.\n\nApart from anything else, you\u2019re cutting your son off from his primary caregiver very abruptly and at a year old he his big enough for that to have lasting implications on his levels of stress and his ability to form healthy attachments.\n\nWanting your own space and some privacy is reasonable. Taking back your key is also reasonable. Blaming her for being attached to your son when you made a decision to have her care for him and cutting contact to nothing or nearly nothing? That goes too far.\n\nYour language is very passive towards this situation - but you are the parent here and you made choices to create and allow this situation to continue and it\u2019s not her fault that you did that or that she has some whiplash from the speed at which you\u2019ve changed your mind; and it\u2019s not best for your son to treat his aunt as a stranger and ditch her entirely for a new caregiver.\n\nIs that really what your wife would have wanted? Or would she have preferred for you to make an arrangement where your SIL has regular contact (not necessarily in your home or on an ad-hoc basis, but with your support and approval) and your son is eased into the transition but still has contact with someone with whom he has a strong bond?\n\nAnd because this is Reddit - [insert obligatory question about whether the reason for all this is that you\u2019re dating someone and don\u2019t want to be judged for it\u2026?]", "Sorry but yta. I dont really get what has changed from when she was living with you. You let her stay at your place for a year looking after your child on her own, so i have no idea why you have an issue with her going over to your house to do the same now. Surely shes a very trustworthy person or you wouldn't have let her take care of your son for a year.", "YTA. Sounds like you used her for free babysitting, then kicked her to the curb. You would rather pay a babysitter who doesn\u2019t know your own kid, then having your wife\u2019s sister who helped you over a year taking care of your baby?  Explain please", "It does sound a bit like you were using her. You were happy for her to be around full time as long as she was taking care of your child for you. \n\nYour language sounds as though you thought the situation was fine as long as you were financially benefitting by not having to hire a babysitter but as soon as there\u2019s no financial benefit she\u2019s \u2018intruding\u2019. \n\nI think you are trying to convince yourself that she got a really good deal out of the past year and this is some quid pro quo business. e.g. \u2018she lived there rent free and got to be closer to her only nephew\u2019. Why do you view it in this regard? Your son got to be closer to a maternal relative, which in the long run could mean a lot to him given the sad circumstances. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound ideal to have her popping over unannounced but it feels like there are other measures that could be attempted first, like her texting if she\u2019s on her way over. I understand that you have a babysitter, but is it really a big deal if she happens to be there while the babysitter is there? Also you\u2019ve stated that there\u2019s \u2018no reason\u2019 for her to be there now that you have a babysitter. I would suggest that forging a familial bond is perhaps a reason for her being there, even if you have a babysitter.", "Soft TA. But only for phrasing it wrong. \n\nYes it is your house and I see where you are coming from. That you don't want her to drop by every minute and disturb your free time. Having a guast can be exausting. \n\nBut yes, she is also invested in her nephew. She might love the little one.\n\nIf it would work for you, maybe you two can work out a shedule. Like she can come over or take the little guy to her place once or twice a week. So you can have spare time for yourself and she can have time with her nephew. But tell her, why you don't want her to drop in every minute.", "Soft YTA , while it's your house, she took care of her nephew and was there for both of you, she didn't do anything wrong so it's kinda rude to .. 'limit' her all out of sudden and you didn't handle it well. I think your wife wouldnt like your decision.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I understand and was in that situation myself.  When my husband passed his brother came over unannounced all the time.  It became frustrating as I wasn\u2019t dressed at the time or showered.  I was always worried he was going to show up.  I texted finally after many months and told him he has to let me know before he comes over. He took it pretty poorly and won\u2019t speak to me now.  I guess their family dynamics are different than mine.   But no other members of his family do that. It felt uncomfortable.", "She's still free to see my son, but not unannounced. Due to the tension in between us now, we haven't worked out a system yet.", "Before the conversation, I had not discussed boundaries with her other than an occasional comment. Her behavior is fine, she's never been involved in anything bad but can tend to be a little pushy at times. I was a little worn out and short during the conversation, and may have not made it clear enough that I still wanted her in my son's life, just not to the extent that she had been.", "NTA. Boundaries are necessary. It's also rude to show up at anyone's house unannounced unless you're specifically invited to. \n\nShe will come around.", "Ah, okay. Then very gently, YTA. Your position is understandable, but the execution was rough. No judgement tho. You're going through a lot. It sounds like this went from 0 to 100, but it could be a bigger conversation about what interactions you feel are healthy and appropriate for you and your kiddo.\n\nShe overstepped, but it sounds like she means well and didn't realize her behaviour was a problem (I'm maybe giving her a bit of leeway because I was also an oblivious, self-absorbed 20yo once). \n\nIf she's reasonable and chill, she'll understand your POV and work with you on a system that works for you."]}
