Everyone in the family was understandably heartbroken, but my wife's sister (22) was closer to her. She lives in the same city as us and since she graduated college soon after her sister died, she moved into my house to be a live in babysitter for my son. There was no pay, she lived there rent-free and got to be closer to her only nephew, and I we were both able to manage our grief better.\n\nWe're both in a much better mental state now and SIL got a job in the same city and moved out. I was fine with this, only, she started coming over almost every day (I wanted her to keep a house key in case of emergency). This quickly grew frustrating as I had hired a baby sitter and there wasn't really a reason for her to be intruding unnecessarily in my house anymore.\n\nI sat her down and told her that I was uncomfortable with her coming into my house whenever to see my son and I wanted the house key back. She gave it but said she was disappointed that after she committed a year of her life to taking care of her nephew and rarely going out with her friends or living a life for herself, she wasn't even aloud to see him. I told her that it was her decision to care for my son and left.\n\nHer side of the family is calling me an a-hole now. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: First of all, I would like to thank all of you for your comments. I understand now that the way I spoke to SIL was harsh and downplayed her time and effort taking care of my son. I want it make it clear that it was never my intention to use SIL as a free babysitter, and that she is and will be an important part of my son\u2019s life and family so long as that is what she wishes. I am incredibly grateful now for her efforts and am planning to reach out to SIL and apologize, as well as create more opportunities for her to see and spend time with her nephew.", "created_utc": 1692265295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tilnn/aita_for_not_allowing_my_sil_to_be_close_with_my/", "score": 1531, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On one hand, it is your house and your child and you are fully allowed to make those decisions for them, and I understand wanting more control over what happens in your house and with your kid. \n\nOn the other hand, the way you've described it feels a bit abrupt and a bit dismissive of her feelings. I can see how she would feel like she's been misled about her role in your child's life.\n\nMaybe I need more info: Did you try talking to her about when and how she could come over and spend time with your child? Did you try setting boundaries and she kept breaking them, or did she just assume she was welcome until you took her key? Are there concerns about her behaviour that make you not want her to have access to your house/child?

It's always good to have a local ally that can do a drive-by at the house for you if you forgot something for your son. Plus, it makes it feel like you don't trust that she'll respect the updated boundaries.", "YTA for blaming her for the decision to help you raise your son at your time of greatest need and then just cutting her off completely. There are ways to impose boundaries more gently and kindly.\n\nApart from anything else, you\u2019re cutting your son off from his primary caregiver very abruptly and at a year old he his big enough for that to have lasting implications on his levels of stress and his ability to form healthy attachments.\n\nWanting your own space and some privacy is reasonable. Taking back your key is also reasonable. Blaming her for being attached to your son when you made a decision to have her care for him and cutting contact to nothing or nearly nothing? That goes too far.\n\nYour language is very passive towards this situation - but you are the parent here and you made choices to create and allow this situation to continue and it\u2019s not her fault that you did that or that she has some whiplash from the speed at which you\u2019ve changed your mind; and it\u2019s not best for your son to treat his aunt as a stranger and ditch her entirely for a new caregiver.\n\nIs that really what your wife would have wanted? Or would she have preferred for you to make an arrangement where your SIL has regular contact (not necessarily in your home or on an ad-hoc basis, but with your support and approval) and your son is eased into the transition but still has contact with someone with whom he has a strong bond?\n\nAnd because this is Reddit - [insert obligatory question about whether the reason for all this is that you\u2019re dating someone and don\u2019t want to be judged for it\u2026?]", "Sorry but yta. I dont really get what has changed from when she was living with you. You let her stay at your place for a year looking after your child on her own, so i have no idea why you have an issue with her going over to your house to do the same now.

You were happy for her to be around full time as long as she was taking care of your child for you. \n\nYour language sounds as though you thought the situation was fine as long as you were financially benefitting by not having to hire a babysitter but as soon as there\u2019s no financial benefit she\u2019s \u2018intruding\u2019. \n\nI think you are trying to convince yourself that she got a really good deal out of the past year and this is some quid pro quo business. e.g. \u2018she lived there rent free and got to be closer to her only nephew\u2019. Why do you view it in this regard? Your son got to be closer to a maternal relative, which in the long run could mean a lot to him given the sad circumstances. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound ideal to have her popping over unannounced but it feels like there are other measures that could be attempted first, like her texting if she\u2019s on her way over. I understand that you have a babysitter, but is it really a big deal if she happens to be there while the babysitter is there? Also you\u2019ve stated that there\u2019s \u2018no reason\u2019 for her to be there now that you have a babysitter. I would suggest that forging a familial bond is perhaps a reason for her being there, even if you have a babysitter.", "Soft TA.

But it sounds like that's her replacement when it shouldn't be. She's your son's family. She's the one that can tell him stories about his mother that even you don't know.\nLet her have that and more importantly, give your son a chance to have that.\n\nI think you should apologize for being so harsh but maybe mention how you try to find a new routine and her visiting unannounced kind of gets in the way with that.\n\nSet boundaries but don't reject her.", "YTA.

I have a nephew and when he was a baby, I used to get up at 5:30 or 6:00 in the morning and arrange my entire work and class schedule just so once a week I could get there before my sister left for work and help my parents babysit, and thankfully both my sister and BIL are alive so there wasn\u2019t an extra tangled added layer of grief in there. There were times, in my excitement to be an aunt, I overstepped in my eagerness to be there and my sister talked to me about it. But she ALWAYS lead with appreciation for my willingness to help and be involved, and she was ALWAYS clear to me that what was most important to her and her husband was that I didn\u2019t put my education or social life on hold for her or my nephew. Saying it was \u201cher choice\u201d for your SIL not go out is BS. Speaking to her like she\u2019s a former employee who won\u2019t hand in her badge is horrible. \n\nI\u2019m rarely angered. My family rarely gets angry at each other even when we should - we\u2019re a conflict-avoidant people. But if my sister or BIL had ever approached me or spoken to me that way, not only would I go full nuclear, but my parents and brother would probably also be pretty ticked off.
