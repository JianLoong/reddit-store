I'd probably even consider paying for it again if she just apologizes and just talks to me about whats her problem with me. i think this is the only way to built up enough pressure so that she finally talks to me. its not like i hate her. i want to teach her a lesson. some might say its probably just her puberty hormones but she behaved this way towards me even before she got into puberty. she always was distant.

You may be right but is that worth your relationship? What\u2019s making her feel that way?", "NTA you ask your sister not once but twice to talk and she refused to talk.

No one has the right to use you as an ATM machine.", "My god it\u2019s your parents responsibility to pay for these things NOT YOU! your doing this as a gift and she absolutely disrespected you, not to one person BUT MANY! You gave her the opportunity to explain herself (which is more than I would have done) and she basically gave you the middle finger. Do not pay for jackshit for her again. She fucked around and found out. NTA", "YTA. She's a minor. She probably feels ostracized and othered by you and your brothers and by only paying your brother's fees, you are showing her that it's true. You're the adult. Time to find a way to get to know her as this has probably built up over time.", "NTA. Your father has had ample time to get another job.", "NTA. Don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds you", "NTA - you don't say how old you or your sister are, but she's clearly old enough to learn the lesson about not biting the hand that feeds you.  She's talking behind your back, saying nasty things and it's pretty harsh of your folks to expect you to cough up money for her education when she won't even have a simple conversation and explain WTF her freaking issue is to begin with.  Let her go a semester on her own and see if she's willing to revisit the point.  And your folks need to step up and parent, not just expect you to be a doormat for her attitude.", "NTA in any way, shape or form. You have already done an amazing thing helping out your parents by generously paying for your siblings\u2019 education. Your sister is being ungrateful and rude.

However, aren't you interested to know why she thinks you don't care about her and only care for your brother's? \n\nJeopardising her education isn't going to make her talk to you, it's going to reinforce her opinion that you don't care. If you want to get to the bottom of this you need to try other methods. Ask your parents, try to include her, write her a letter, that sort of thing. Do some self reflection to see if you can think of a reason - do you have more in common with your brother's etc.", "YTA for using your money to attempt to manipulate other people\u2019s behavior.

Do I think you\u2019re kind of an ah for trying to \u2018teach her a lesson\u2019 and pressuring her to talk to you? Kind of. She was talking to her cousin about her private feelings. And I would say if anything, you kind of proved her point a bit. But, rules say that it\u2019s your money and you\u2019re not her parent so you do you.", "NTA\n\nBut this a decision that will make you morally in the right but won\u2019t make you happy.\n\nYour sister lashed out, but this wasn\u2019t your sister picking apart your flaws, degrading you, belittling you and making fun of everything about you. That was not the tirade of someone who thinks very little of you or hates you but loves your money; that was a rant of someone of whom desperately wants your approval but feels rejected. \n\nThere is something going on with her that\u2019s making her feel like that. Maybe she was extremely introverted and was unable to bond with you, but seeing your relationship to your brothers she feels jealous and doesn\u2019t know how to handle that . She could be struggling with some mental health issues. Her sitting in silence at dinner and disappearing doesn\u2019t sound like the actions of someone doing well\n\nIf you withhold money, you\u2019ll punish your sister but you\u2019ll prove to her in her distorted lense of herself (that\u2019s coloured by self loathing) that you truly hate her. But honestly I would not go there just yet. I think you should wait it out, keep trying with your sister and see if you can get her to open up. Maybe talk to your parents to see if they\u2019ve noticed any issues with her. Get your mother to try and convince her to open communication. Maybe if you\u2019re up for it see if you can get her some kind of counselling. \n\nBut I think you owe it to your own happiness to try and see what\u2019s happening with her. If you still feel the same in a couple of months you can still cut her off. But I think you\u2019ll regret it if you do this out of anger", "NTA it\u2019s your money and you can do what you please with it. If sister doesn\u2019t want ANYTHING to do with op then that includes your money and you paying for HER education. Sister doesn\u2019t get to have it both ways of wanting no relationship but expects you to pay her way. Let her pay her own way, it\u2019s not the parents responsibility to pay her college tuition either. Time for sister to be an actual adult get a job take out student loans.", "NTA\n\n\"Sister said she hated me and wished I would disappear. I will not be doing that due to my bonds with the rest of the family however if I DID disappear, she would no longer have access to my money for her education. I am literally giving her what she wants. And can someone please explain to me WHY she isn't being told off for trying to poison my cousin against me?\"", "NTA\n\nIt's your money after all but I'll also say one thing that if it really affects you that much and you really want an apology from her you could go to her and state how you felt in that situation and explain why you decided to cut her off financially. If she's mature enough she'll understand and maybe you guys can get along and if she still doesn't come to sort things out then definintely don't think about it any further.\n\nBut I'll say that give it a try once, before making things permanent. \n\nEdit: Because like you explained your parents are not financially stable to sponsor your sibling's education & I think no one's education should suffer due to these reason. If nothing works out between you and your sister i think you can do still sponser her education on one condition that she gives this money back as soon as she starts earning and make sure she understand these conditons properly.\n\nObviously it's still YOUR decision I was just trying to offer you a middle ground.", "NAH. I don't think your sister is an AH for speaking to a family member she trusts about how she feels. Ever heard the phrase eavesdroppers rarely hear good things? I also don't think you're an AH for not funding education as it's not your responsibility. \n\nHowever, I think Y T A for this:\n\n'i think this is the only way to built up enough pressure so that she finally talks to me. its not like i hate her. i want to teach her a lesson.'\n\nDon't use an education to manipulate someone into doing what you want. I don't agree your sister needs to be taught a lesson here; she clearly has a problem with you and she has not been fake towards you (she avoids you). Either accept it or try to salvage the relationship without using education as a tool to manipulate.", "NTA. It is your money and you're not the parent. But you could have played it better. By cutting her off you've possibly played into whatever negative narrative that has been said of you. Using your money as leverage like this will lead to awful power dynamics and resentment for everyone. Do you want your sibling to genuinely love you, or have a superficial smile and relationship until she no longer needs your money?", "NTA. As others have said, you gave her many chances to talk to you and most people would give up after just asking once & being refused tbh. \nShe needs to understand that you\u2019re not responsible for paying for her education and that she needs to learn some respect. Maybe after this stunt, she will learn a lesson.", "ESH\n\nI'm torn. On one hand you don't owe her an education and shouldn't have to fund someone who hates you but on the other hand I do find it cruel to suddenly cut off funding for someone's education with no notice. Maybe if you told her you'd only be paying for the rest of the year I'd say N T A?", "YTA Just for the \"teach her a lesson\" part, maybe step off that soapbox for a minute", "YTA- you never had a prob paying until you overheard her *private* conversation with someone she trusted. You then tried to force a conversation she didn\u2019t want to have. Now you\u2019ve left her floundering by pulling funding for her education, while still paying for the rest of your siblings. \n\nHmm, that almost sounds like exactly what you sister said you were like. \n\nYou can\u2019t *force* or *pressure* someone to talk to you if they aren\u2019t ready too. Since you\u2019ve seemingly not had a problem paying your siblings tuitions up until this point, and are only reacting to something you *overheard*, you\u2019re the asshole. \n\nA lot of other commenters will say that your parents should be providing, blah blah blah, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re judging here. We\u2019re judging you pulling funding and sabotaging your sisters education and future because she had a private convo with a family member she trusted that you overheard where she wasn\u2019t spreading any rumours. She was talking about how she felt with her relationship with you.", "YTA \n\n\nThere is no reason you need to be paying for your siblings' education. You could have said no at the start.\n\n\nBut, your sister confided in someone else that she feels like you don't care about her, and just care about your brothers, and your response is \"Well then, I will just show you how little I care and stop helping you and only help my brothers\". She obviously has some reason she feels like this, and you don't want to talk to her to actually find out why she feels like this, you want her to apologize for feeling like this, and confiding in someone else while you were eavesdropping.", "YTA. How old are all the parties involved here? Teenagers aren't the most mature and neither are you.\n\nIt sounds like she thinks you favor your brothers and since she didn't obey you when you wanted to talk, you cut off her funding like the favorites having tyrant she thinks you are. You kinda proved her point here.\n\nBlackmail isn't the best way to have an honest relationship with your sister.", "This is a tricky one. One one hand, it's your money and you have no obligation to fund anything.\n\nOn the other, your motivation for doing this is manipulation. Which is typically frowned upon.\n\nGonna go with ESH because you're both doing shitty things.", "So.... Tentative Y T A\n\n> we just never really had anything to do with each other and basically ignored each other. even when i would visit she'd just lock herself in her room while i spent time with my younger brothers\n\nAnd\n\n> she told him how i don't care about her and that i am an ignorant asshole who only cares about my brothers and that she hated me and wished i would just disappear.\n\nDon't make you realize that you actively spend time with her brothers but ignored her.\n\n\nAnd then in response to hearing her say she feels unloved you... Cut her off.\n\n\nYeah.... Ok", "YTA not for not paying, but for using your money to coerce her. It is called financial abuse. You are not a parent, you do not need to teach her a lesson. Education is not a luxury, it is a necessity. Using your power to control that is abhorrent", "NTA You tried to talk it over like an adult, she refused.", "YTA. You aren't punishing your sister, you are punishing your parents. It's hitting them financially, not her. I also really don't like how controlling you sound. You are basically pouring gasoline on whatever fire is going on with your sister.", "NTA. She needs to talk it out with you and explain why she's feeling that way.

How dare you not like me, take that.", "YTA for never bothering to find out why she said this thing you claim you overheard.", "NTA. Little sis needs to learn a thing or two about not biting the hand that feeds her. If she feels that she is being ignored/neglected/whatever, she can communicate with you (she has no issues communicating with others!)\n\nNo one, including your parents, is entitled to your money. You are paying for her education because you are a good sibling and you care. It\u2019s okay to give a taste of the real world to someone who doesn\u2019t seem to notice about how much you do for them. Also, the parents sound like they are enabling this behavior if they\u2019re jumping down your throat, but dismissed your sister\u2019s behavior. If they have any issues with your decision, they can take out a loan \u2014 problem solved.", "NTA. Somebody should set her down and find out what the real problem is.", "NTA Don't talk bad about the person who is giving you money is a very simple rule. I've no idea why no one in the family has spoken to her about her attitude towards you. Why haven't your parents or siblings jumped to your defence or asked you to talk to her? If no one is defending you are others agreeing with her?
