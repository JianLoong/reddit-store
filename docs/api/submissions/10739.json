So I decided to cook ramen for him. Here's some background info. Him and I travel for work so our schedules often don't align where we are both home at the same time so on this particular event I had just arrived home at 1am from being gone for a month for work. He was due to leave for work in 2 days and would be gone for the next 3 months. So the only day I could host him was the same day I came home.\n\nI got home at 1 am, took a nap for a couple hours then started to make my ramen. I labored all day through to dinner time to make sure the meal was ready. On this particular week I had some fresh scallops just off the boat and it was gonna be turned into an appetizer, a very nice treat as fresh deep sea scallops are very expensive, especially in the winter. \n\nGuest arrives, I have everything in place and I tell him that I will start us off with some seared scallop appetizers. He tells me that he hates scallops so I say \"oh that's OK, this works out, we'll skip the scallops and my wife and I will enjoy them tomorrow. We love scallops\" he says, \"sorry I just don't like scallops, I hate the texture and flavor\" \"no problem dude, more for me and my wife\". \n\nI make him a ramen bowl and not a few minutes into eating he tells me that his dad loves scallops and asks if he can get the scallops to go. I tell him, \"no thanks, I told you, I'm gonna make these scallops for me and my wife tomorrow\" \"please dude, my dad would really enjoy them\" but I stood my ground and said no again and was firm about it. \n\nA few more minutes into eating he asks if I can make a ramen bowl to-go for his dad then. At this point I'm just done with this guy but my wife gave me that look and just nodded yes. So I give in and say fine. I make one ramen to go immediately, and before he even finished eating I told him, \"sorry man, I'm tired and I want to get to bed and spend time with my family. I need you finish up asap and leave\" \n\nHe does and he thanks me and takes the ramen and goes on his merry way. \n\nNow my wife is an angel, but this time I'm not siding with her. She says I was rude and pushed him out unnecessarily. But if you guys knew a fraction of what it takes to be a scallop fishermen you would know that it's an incredibly hard job that gets people mamed and killed each year. I've done the job and still do from time to time. This might sound silly but being a fisherman and having gone through some near death experiences on the boats, I don't take for granted those little delicious little sea creatures so when my family gifts me scallops. I enjoy the shit out of them and wanted to do so this time. \n\nWas I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1677170025, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a1zbx/aita_for_rushing_my_dinner_guest_to_leave_as_soon/", "score": 178, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And then ask for a second portion also to go for somebody else? You're not a restaurant, that's not how 'having people over for dinner' works.\n\nIt may have been a little rude to rush him off but as long as you weren't actually rude in speaking/acting I don't see an issue. You have little time between long working time and spent a lot of energy on this dinner.", "NTA. Actually, he was super rude first by asking for scallops that you specifically said were already designated for tomorrow's meals and then asking for ramen for his dad on top of it. Like what are you, his restaurant?", "Nope\nHe got choosy and greedy at the same time\nYou do take home at a restaraunt not a host's home\nNTA", "NTA - enjoy those scallops.", "NTA you\u2019re not a restaurant. You can give people leftovers but guests asking for a takeaway order is ridiculous and an AH move.", "NTA- it doesn't matter how hard it is to get scallops. It's really rude for the guest to ask for food for his father and then press when you say no, especially when the guest isn't someone you know well.", "NTA. Be happy he won't be back, I guess.", "NTA, you are not his personal chef.\n\nI'm all about being flexible and hospitable for guests, but he was being extremely entitled and expecting treatment way past the line of hospitality. Begging you to cook something *he rejected* so that he can take it to go for someone else? Especially when that something is best served fresh, *and* you'd already said you were going to save it for you and your wife? And then to ask you to make a full additional serving of the meal for him to take home? \n\nThis was not a paid-for restaurant dinner! He was a guest in your home and he was behaving abysmally. Your wife is extremely accommodating, and I salute her patience, but you certainly don't have to match it. Being a bit terse in getting him out the door was just fine.", "What post are all these E-S-H reading? OP was NOT mad the guy didn\u2019t want to eat the scallops. He was annoyed that he wanted to take a very expensive and rare ingredient he wasn\u2019t even eating home to someone else, like OP is running a restaurant. To sum up, the guest:\n\n1) had been messaging for months to \u201chang out\u201d at OPs house so OP could cook for him. He basically invited himself over for a labor intensive meal \n2) wanted a special ingredient for take away for someone OP doesn\u2019t even know\n3) asked for another serving of the food to take home, again to someone OP doesn\u2019t even know\n\nI disagree OP was rude by asking him leave as soon as he was done. When you host a guest (in this case a self invited guest) and they act rudely, I think it\u2019s appropriate to withdraw your hospitality at that point. He didn\u2019t toss him into a snowbank while he was still eating, he asked him late in the evening to finish his meal and go home. NTA.", "NTA. Your home is not a restaurant.", "NTA", "INFO: Would you have still pushed him out if he hadn\u2019t been so disrespectful? I get asking someone to leave when they\u2019re treating you like an unpaid personal chef/waiter, but it would be rude on your part to invite someone over for dinner and get mad at them for not finishing their meal fast enough. \n\nI\u2019d also want to get this guy the hell out of my house before he could start perusing the pantry and asking if he could take that stuff to go!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat an AH.", "NTA\n\nYour guest was rude. You don't show up at someone's house for a meal you badgered them to make for you and ask for a doggie bag.", "NTA- This \"guest\" was rude af. Who asks for food to go as a dinner guest? Don't invite him over EVER again.", "NTA - You're a lot nicer than me, he deserved to be pushed out.\n\n1.He invited himself to your place for ramen without you making the offer\n\n2.He doesn't like scallops but put in an order for his dad - this isn't a restaurant\n\n3.Asked for ramen for his dad - again, this is not a restaurant.\n\nDid he even bring a host gift????", "NTA. I honestly think he just changed his mind and wanted them for himself since he was begging like that after he just said he didn't like them. Then asking for more food? None of my friends act like that and neither do my husband's. His behavior was not just rude but fishy (no pun intended). I'm a nice person myself but even that would get under my skin. Not to mention that you got home at 1am just to be kind enough to bring him over at a weird time like that? He could have been more respectful of your time.", "NTA and now you know to never have this guy over again.", "ESH you chose to host this guy when it was a huge imposition and then acted like it was a huge imposition. For his part he was rude AF with the requests.", "ESH\n\nI was on your side until the end. Just because people are willing to risk their lives and health for scallops doesn't mean everyone has to like them. You act like it's a personal slight instead of a difference in tastes and likes. \n\nAs for your guest,  guy was a turd.", "ESH (except your sweet wife). I understand completely that you were already tired, but you set the date and agreed to host this guy. Basically pushing him out the door before he's even finished his meal was rude AF. He's allowed to have likes and dislikes on food, even if you don't agree, so that shouldn't have offended you as much as it obviously did. But he definitely went too far in asking for a \"to go\" bag of scallops for his dad, especially when you'd said you weren't going to cook them after all. In fact, asking for a \"to go\" bag at all is extremely rude in my opinion. If you'd offered one, it would have been different, but I don't know how I would have reacted either.", "ESH are you an asshole for the scallops, no. I do think you invited him but didn\u2019t really want to and it was apparent in the end. He was a pretty annoying \u201cguest\u201d from the start when he was nagging for the ramen and asking to take food with. Made me wonder how you even know him and why you continue to know him. I\u2019d give you a pass as having handled things well but I feel pretty strongly about treating guests a certain way and the - finish up and leave - part was rude.", "ESH except your wife\n\nHe was being a rude guest, and you were rude in rushing him out. Does it matter that you were an asshole too? in the long run, do you care about maintaining this friendship? probably not\n\nbut your reasoning is ridiculous. some people don't like some foods. no big deal. doesn't matter how easy or hard they are to secure.", "NTA but calm down about scallop fisherman.", "ESH. He was being a rude guest asking for things \"to go,\" but you didn't need to kick him out after the scallop situation was already over.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
