What she\u2019s doing is analogous to stealing medication.", "NTA- not having those particular toiletries is actually harmful to you so in my mind she is stealing medication you need. You could probably buy your own blow dryer and curling iron cheaper than it's costing you to replace your toiletries.", "NTA. She is a thief. Doesnt matter the price of the products. They are yours and she is using them more often than you have offered. You tried the friendly \"keep the peace\" route by talking to her many times. Are you and your friends in the same spot financially? If so, show them the price of the product and how often you've had to replace the items now that roommate is using them daily. And no, sharing styling tools (a one time cost) is not the same as sharing products that do have an eventual end to them. \n\nHave you talked to your landlord/whoever about possibly trying to add some form of lock to bedroom doors? Also, maybe keep them up to date (if possible), or at least documentation, on the situation just in case roommate starts going extreme so that way you have proof/plausible reason to back out of an existing lease if necessary.\n\nEdit: obviously hair tools do have an eventual end to them as well but a few years, with proper care, is completely different to what, a few weeks maybe 2 months depending on how much of each product you use? $50 for something that'll last 3 years is different than $50 every month", ">I moved all of my stuff out of the bathroom and put it in my room, and she still went in there to get it.

Ask her what exactly she would call using things you've asked her specifically not to use, if she doesn't like it being considered theft. (Hint: it's theft.)

How does it make sense to compare a bottle of lotion to a hair dryer?\n\nYou shouldn't have had to lock up your supplies. She shouldn't have been stealing from you.

If she never had bad intentions, then you taking the extreme step of buying a lock box to keep your toiletries safe from her, should have caused her to reflect and realize that she forced you to take this step because she was so unwilling to respect your boundaries. Someone who never intended to take things from you that you weren't willing to share would be mortified, apologetic, and hopefully offering to pay you back and make things right. She's only angry that you have locked her out, proving that if it weren't for the lock she would continue taking your stuff. That is bad intentions. \n\nNTA.

I can also go out and get myself a hairdryer and straightener and would only need to buy it the one time.
