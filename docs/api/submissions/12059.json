I mean daily. We have one bathroom in our apartment so we both have to use it. She uses my shampoo and conditioner every time she showers. She has been using my lotion every day. This is causing me to run out so fast and I'm struggling to afford to keep up with it. I've talked to her about it multiple times and have told her that I'm fine if she uses it occasionally, but that the rate she's using them now is not okay. I've even suggested that she buys her own if she likes it so much. But this has fallen on deaf ears, and I'm so tired. I moved all of my stuff out of the bathroom and put it in my room, and she still went in there to get it. (Our bedroom doors unfortunately do not have locks on them.) There have been so many times I've finished a shower, can't find my lotion, have to ask her where it is and she says it's in her room. \n\nI finally got tired enough to buy a lockbox and keep my toiletries in it. This, however, caused her to become very mad at me. She threw it in my face that she lets me use her hair styling tools (blow dryer, straightener, curling iron etc.) and I kept trying to tell her that it's just not the same.

Unless you had both previously agreed to each chip in 50% of the cost for shared toiletries, your roommate has no right to use your personal hygiene products. She needs to buy her own, and if I were in your situation I would be asking her to cover the cost of the product she used without your permission. Sharing appliances is a completely different situation. Does she also expect that she should be entitled to use your toothbrush whenever she feels like it?", "*I finally got tired enough to buy a lockbox and keep my toiletries in it. This, however, caused her to become very mad at me.*\n\nShe can stay mad and run to her friends to complain all she wants. She *is* a thief who made it necessary for you to lock away your toiletries.\n\nAnd since she thinks using hair care tools is the same as using up expensive lotions and the like, invest in your own to use. If it's feasible, move as soon as your lease allows.
