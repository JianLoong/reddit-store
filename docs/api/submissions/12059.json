It\u2019s easy to say when the $$ isn\u2019t coming out of their pockets", "NTA. But you should get your own blow dryer and curler, just so that comes off the table. I\u2019d probably fill up the empty containers with cheap shitty products and leave those out while still keeping the real ones in my room, but that\u2019s me. Replace your doorknob with one that locks; that\u2019s easy to do and you can replace it again when you move out, if the landlord objects. Or honestly, really think about whether you want to keep rooming with this person.", "Keep things completely separate, it sounds like it\u2019s the only way.", "NTA. She's stealing from you!", "NTA\n\nAlthough the better alternative might have been to bill her for her half since she seems to think it is hers, if she isn't a thief then she should have no problem paying for it.", "NTA\n\nSend the people on her side links to the products so they can buy it for her.", "NTA. Lock up the rest of your stuff too. She doesn\u2019t seem trustworthy.", "NTA. Tell her friends that unfortunately, you\u2019re on a very tight budget and the items you purchased are due to allergy issues. If they feel badly for her, here\u2019s the list of items that you used and here\u2019s how to purchase those to keep their friend supplied. \n\nAt this point, it\u2019s probably better for you to get your own hair styling tools and stop loaning things back and forth between the both of you. Have a mature talk to her about how this loose loaning system no longer works and it\u2019s best of you both just have your own separate things.", "NTA, but buy your own hairdryer etc", "NTA. She\u2019s taking your specialty stuff without your permission even though you\u2019ve explicitly asked her not to. If it walks like a thief and quacks like a thief, it\u2019s a thief.", "NTA!  You asked her to not use your products.  She continued, even after moving them into your bedroom.  Once she took them from your room, she became a thief.  And I would be buying my own hair styling tools as well.", "NTA your roommate is a total mooch and it\u2019s not okay. Die on this hill.", "NTA. I\u2019m amazed you can keep it in one box. I\u2019ve seen women that barely go out have 2 bathrooms full, and 2 drawers too. \n\nShe\u2019s a moocher and not your friend.\n\nBuy your own electrical equipment.", "Nta. If it\u2019s that important to your friends then they can buy her skincare.", "NTA. You\u2019ve asked her not to and she does anyway. WTF?", "NTA  You tried to talk to her calmly about it, moved it into your bedroom and had her invade your space there and she still isn't getting the message.  Your other friends don't have to live with her or pay for them so their opinion is moot.  Next time she brings it up, show her how much this costs per item and ask if she want's to go 50/50 on that expense as well. And she was being a thief.", "NTA\n\nYou brought it up with her, she didn't stop using it.\n\nYou cannot compare 'lotion' to 'hair tools'. I mean, lotion is a finite object, hair tools, not so much.\n\nShe may not have had bad intentions, but she refused to correct her actions when you asked her to. This makes her the asshole in this situation.", "She is a thief from every angle.  Ask mutual friends to donate shampoo, lotion and stuff to her and if they refuse, tell them they are not that different than you and STFU.\nNTA, you need to find friends with good morales.  I cannot think any of my good friends would think I was overreacting in this situation if I were you.", "If good intentions were money you wouldn't have a problem. Besides that point, if she actually had good intentions she wouldn't be using your expensive and highly selective things. It's extremely unfair for her to be insisting on using all of your product when you have a limited budget for those things. She needs to be buying her own s***. You set boundaries and requested those boundaries be respected and she trampled on them. Protect your stuff. Protect your skin. You are NTA.", "NTA I did the same thing when I had roommates. I kept all of my toiletries, cleaning products and utensils in my room where they couldn\u2019t use them. I even had to start keeping my snacks in my room too since they started eating from my cabinet. Keep your stuff to yourself, she isn\u2019t entitled to any of it", "NTA she IS a thief. She steals from you daily. She does have bad intentions. Using a tool? Doesnt cost money.  Ditch the mutuals who cannot grasp these simple concepts. And move out at the end of the lease. In my experience? She wlll keep stealing your stuff and become more and more of a dead beat.", "NTA. I also have very sensitive skin, and the lotion I have to use is crazy expensive!  I would never have allowed the roommate to use it uess they went 50/50 on it. The eczema lotions are marked way up and they are the only ones that work. You don't run out of a curling iron, you just plug it in. Your roommate is selfish af.", "So here is what you do.  When one of your bottles of shampoo/conditioner is empty, fill it with something less expensive", "I had a roommate once who kicked in my locked bedroom door to get something she wanted.  Claimed one of her cats was locked in there.  I moved out within days.\n\nEDIT : NTA.", "You live with a thief. It\u2019s astounding to me that she doesn\u2019t realize she\u2019s a thief.", "Did OP repost this or was this story stolen from someone else.  I read this exact post a few months ago", "NTA. Maybe suggest going 50/50 on all the products.  I had a house mate that used to eat all my food before, j ended up either consuming it immediately or locking it in my room. Was very frustrated", "NTA.  Also, get your own styling tools and stop sharing clothes.  She doesn't understand the concept and it will say you grief in the long run.", "NTA.  Having someone use your personal hygiene products sucks.  Keep it locked up.  What I would advise you to is stop using her things and call it even.  In her mind, it was the same thing, even though it isn\u2019t.", "This. It's the consequences of her own actions", ">because I'm treating her like some sort of thief when she never had bad intentions.\n\nSo the roomie intentionally taking and using products without permission, without replacing said items is okay because they didn't mean anything by it.  Got it.  Literally the roomie got angry for not being able to use OP's product, realizing OP won't subsidize roomie's lifestyle and roomie now has to pay for her own sh\\*t.  NTA and OP needs new friends who have her back and not some crazy notion that people who buy stuff for personal use do so with money that they have earned.", "She is a thief! Keep your stuff locked.

She sounds financially irresponsible.", "I\u2019d fill them with Nair.", "\ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffe", "Brilliant!", "I mean, maybe she *is* using OP's toothbrush whenever she feels like it. Not sure I'd put it past someone like this.", "Better yet send them a venmo for all the extra product you\u2019ve paid for beyond your typical use.  Once paid for that then send her a bill for buying her her own when you rebuy for yourself if she\u2019d like and use the $ you get to buy your own hair tools.  Done.", "Intentions don\u2019t actually matter. Actions do. Saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t *intend* to steal from you,\u201d while *actively* stealing from OP is utterly unhinged nonsense.", "NTA, you little passive aggressive, kill them with kindness, brilliant genius, you. \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\udc4d", "When you *will*, not can. These \"friends\" have signed themselves up \n\nAlso, move out.", "NTA, but stop using her items as well, as long as you do so, you are giving her a reason to utilize your items.", "I've been straightening my hair for probably 20 years. I've bought 3 flat irons, the second wasn't even broken I just wanted a 1 inch vs 2 inch. They last a long time and mine were cheap (maybe $30 or so, not high end). Sharing hair tools is not even close to the same as sharing cleansing/moisturizing products that get bought every month or so.", "Ackshually....", ">Or do what I did when my housemate was using my body wash. Replace it with mayonnaise and a bit of pink food colouring, combining it with just enough of the body wash so there was still a bit of the scent and looked like the real thing coming out of the bottle\u2026\n\nYou're so evil!\n\nFeel like that scene in Deadpool 1. \"\\[loud voice\\] That was a bad thing to do! \\[whispering\\] Way to go! \\[loud voice\\] I am very disappointed in you! \\[whispering\\] Good job!\" etc.", "\ud83d\ude02", "I wonder the same, AHs always have a gang of people just waiting to barrage someone with texts or calls names on their behalf.", "Yes, this is the way!", "What? Lol! I understand the heating aspect of weed, but what was the plan?", "What blow dryer and straightener do you have and how often do you use them? My wife was going through cheap ones every few years so I bought her a dyson hair dryer and an airwrap which were fairly expensive and from my research they are supposed to last 10-18 years depending on usage.", "Throw some bleach in there also.", "I suppose it's also just society today with everyone having their own BS narrative. Each side of the story including people here giving very one sided narratives", "Have you ever encountered teen girls?", "Okay so the cost of a hair dryer, spread over its lifetime, is maybe 25\u00a2 a month.
