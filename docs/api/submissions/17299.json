You were absolutely right to respect your Stepdaughter's confidence.\n\nThere are situations where it might have been appropriate to break her confidence (if she was in immediate danger, for instance) but this absolutely was not one of them.

Your husband is being an ass and probably feels like his child can't trust him.  It's a bit of a gut punch to realize you are the last to know something regarding your child.

She trusted you with this and you would never betray that trust.  Keeping her trust is paramount because if it's broken, then she'll never come to you again.

He's not the asshole for processing all this.  \n\nI don't think taking your marital issues outside the marriage to the ex wife is a good idea.", "NAH\n\nYou were put in an impossible situation.

But that is not your question. Your question is about telling her father about coming out.\n\nI believe the only benefit to telling your husband would be to make a better or more accurate decision about how to discuss sexual or romantic safety with your stepdaughter.

I know it can be heartbreaking as a parent if my kids didn't come to me first, but I'd be a lot happier knowing they had that close trust with my partner to talk to about these things.
