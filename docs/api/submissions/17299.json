You were absolutely right to respect your Stepdaughter's confidence.\n\nThere are situations where it might have been appropriate to break her confidence (if she was in immediate danger, for instance) but this absolutely was not one of them.

Your husband is being an ass and probably feels like his child can't trust him.  It's a bit of a gut punch to realize you are the last to know something regarding your child.

She trusted you with this and you would never betray that trust.  Keeping her trust is paramount because if it's broken, then she'll never come to you again.

He's not the asshole for processing all this.  \n\nI don't think taking your marital issues outside the marriage to the ex wife is a good idea.", "NAH\n\nYou were put in an impossible situation.

But that is not your question.

You did the right thing. My daughter has this kind of relationship with her stepmom. \nI guess now you understand why she doesn't feel comfortable talking to him about things. My ex would react the same way.", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t ready to share that with her parents yet, and asked you not say anything so that she could do it when she was prepared for it. You respected her wishes. This wasn\u2019t a situation where she was posing any kind of danger to herself that needed to be made known for her safety. She just needed more time, and probably a few more signs of acceptance from others in her life, to feel mentally secure enough to talk about it with her parents. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\n\nNever out people. But especially never out people when they\u2019ve explicitly asked you not to say anything.", "NTA he\u2019s feeling a little insecure and jealous which is completely normal\n\nHe should come around soon to the fact that you\u2019ve played your stepmom role so well that she was able to have a trusted adult to test on", "NTA she came out to you because she was ready to come out to you and it wasn\u2019t your thing to tell him anyway. He knew when she was ready for him to know.", "NTA she's fifteen and figuring herself out -- your husband should be happy that she trusts you and sees you as a safe adult. She told him.", "NTA and tough situation, when someone comes out to you first that means they trust you the most, in order to keep that trust and keep being told things in the future you must keep secret.\n\nI tell my husband everything because we are GOOD about keep secrets between each other and respecting to keep that trust people tell us. However not every relationship shares that respect so in a-lot of cases you would have to keep someone else\u2019s secret from your hubby.", "YTA. Parents should always know what a step parent knows.", "NTA. Instead of being mad, he should wonder why his daughter didn\u2019t feel safe telling him first, what kind of environment he\u2019s providing.\nAlso, you respected your SD, which was the right thing to do.", "NTA. It says a lot that your stepdaughter felt comfortable enough to tell you that. You did the right thing.", "NTA. You were right to respect her privacy and right to come out however she chose. Your husband is wrong here and I hope he comes to understand how good you were to his daughter for being a safe person for her.", "NTA 1) this was not a medical issue dad \\*had\\* to know about. 2) step daughter trusted you and you kept that trust. being a teenager is tough enough and coming out too? she must have been very worried. You gave her a base. had you violated it , who could she trust? you did the right thing.", "NTA - you proved exactly why your stepdaughter felt comfortable coming out to you. You kept her confidence. Good on you. I wish that every teen preparing to come out had someone as steadfast and trustworthy as you.", "> There are good reasons why your stepdaughter did not choose to come out to him until she had secured the support of yourself and her mother.\n\nAnd what, pray tell, are these reasons?  And how do you know them?", "She would have told him if she felt comfortable.", "This. He's feeling rejected because he was the last parent to know, and jealous of the mom and OP bc it's made it clear that his daughter was more comfortable with both of them than she is with him.\n\nAnd considering his response was to throw a tantrum and act like he was entitled to that information before his daughter was ready to share it...gosh, I can't imagine why she'd have felt safer coming out to mom and stepmom first. What a mystery this is.", "\n\n>Not for keeping your sted daughter's secret but for dismissing how your husband feels and for going to his ex to justify your position\n\nhow he feels is irrelevant. if he's mad about being the last to know, then maybe he should do some reflection about why his daughter felt more comfortable coming out to her step mom 2 months before him. beyond that, he can get the fuck over himself.", "100% this.", "You just did what was asked.", "Unfair to assume, we don't know how old the husband is. If the pregnancy was in their teen years, the child'd parents could be in their early 30s. If OP's hubby was 18 when his daughter was born he'd be 33 now, and that's a five year age gap with OP. That's not creepy or weird.", "If she felt comfortable coming out to him sooner, she would have. Clearly she felt comfortable doing so with the others first. That is enough of a reason. Coming out is hugely emotional and personal and people deserve to do it as they want.", "It makes sense why he was told last.", "It's just his ego that's bruised and that's 100% a him problem. He should be happy his daughter trusted you enough to confide in you and that you kept her confidence, not pouting because he wishes he was told first.", "Completely agree. His bruised ego is his problem, not OP's.", "It's not a stereotype when it's a well-recognised *pattern*", "You realize men don't date younger women because they are more pliable right? They are just more attractive to most men. Like they did studies all men (in the studies) found women between 18-24 the most attractive, while women (in the studies) find men 2-3 years older than them more attractive this, this corresponds with all age groups so ie 30 year old women find 32-33 year old men the most attractive but all men no matter the age asked found women between 18-24 the most attractive.", "Stereotype: a widely held but fixed and\u00a0oversimplified\u00a0image or idea of a particular type of person or thing.\n\nIt is exactly a stereotype.  A statement is being made with absolutely no evidence. If I missed some info somewhere, feel free to prove me wrong", "Why are AITA people so fucking cringe? Like can you just be normal? AITA is like a safe haven for socially inept losers.", "I don't understand what this has to do with my post? I'm questioning how the person knows that the man wanted a \"younger, pliable model.\"", "it is not. the evidence is THE PRECEDENT. if something has occurred many times before in similar situations, it's not stereotype. it's literally making hypotheses based off precedence. so if you're gonna try to speak intelligently, at least ACTUALLY know what you're talking about.", "Genuine question: what, exactly, are you contributing to the conversation here?", "Stereotypes are always based on precedent. That's part of the reason why they exist. The issue is that people use stereotypes and assume it is true for every person in the group, just like the previous poster\n\nClaiming precedent as evidence is a logical fallacy when the precedent doesn't even exist for the person in question. Claiming something is a hypothesis has no relevance to this statement because a hypothesis can be formed from stereotypes.\n\nAlso, how are you claiming this happens many times? Do you know how often this happens? How do you know this considering you don't know any demographic information about the people in the story? Is there a minimum number of times this needs to occur to suddenly not become a stereotype? What is this minimal number?\n\nAgain, if there is any information from this story that I missed, feel free to prove me wrong. I dont remember seeing anything about his age or that he was interested in only marrying a younger woman"]}
