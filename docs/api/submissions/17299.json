You were absolutely right to respect your Stepdaughter's confidence.\n\nThere are situations where it might have been appropriate to break her confidence (if she was in immediate danger, for instance) but this absolutely was not one of them.

Your husband is being an ass and probably feels like his child can't trust him.  It's a bit of a gut punch to realize you are the last to know something regarding your child.

She trusted you with this and you would never betray that trust.  Keeping her trust is paramount because if it's broken, then she'll never come to you again.

He's not the asshole for processing all this.  \n\nI don't think taking your marital issues outside the marriage to the ex wife is a good idea.", "NAH\n\nYou were put in an impossible situation.

But that is not your question. Your question is about telling her father about coming out.\n\nI believe the only benefit to telling your husband would be to make a better or more accurate decision about how to discuss sexual or romantic safety with your stepdaughter.

He is her legal guardian.  He has a legal responsibility over her.  He's justifiably upset that another adult kept secrets about his daughter from him.\n\nStepmom was put in an impossible position, and that's not fair to her.\n\nI'm sorry that you had a bad coming out experience, but you can't project that on to every coming out experience.", "?????? Why is it inappropriate to tell someone she\u2019s not straight? You\u2019re not a safe person please avoid children and probably people in general. Parents aren\u2019t entitled to know every single thing about their kids, ESPECIALLY something as harmless and personal as their sexuality. Also, the daughter may have been trying to work up the courage to tell her dad by \u2018practicing\u2019 on OP, she may have seen it as lower stakes. Completely reasonable.", "The evidence that you use, is \"data\" you've picked up from AITA. The selection bias here is absurd, and only a person with some deficiencies couldn't understand that. But that is the eternal prison for people on here i guess.", "I am just being a vulture like you, except my target are my fellow vultures. I am a critic of the critic. I am like you, just aware.", "Projection.", "Oh come off it, she wasn't in danger. Children deserve privacy just as much as anyone else. \n\nHe's upset that he is the last one to know, but instead of looking inward to the reason why, he's blaming the easiest target.", "Oooohh you are a bigot. I get it now. I\u2019m dumb for even arguing with you. Enjoy being a bigot who likes to traumatize kids because you believe they should have absolutely no agency. \n\nAlso, what projecting? I had a perfectly fine coming out experience. Perhaps you\u2019re the one projecting something here\u2026.\n\nDon\u2019t arguing because I don\u2019t argue with assholes who think people should be outed.", "Yeah it sounds like OP's husband is not obeying the rules you have established for who gets to know about his daughter's sexuality UGH that must really frustrate you. Maybe he doesn't think it's harmless. Maybe he lets his daughter have sleepovers at girls houses or have girls sleep over, and now he wants to re-evaluate that. It's totally cool if you think that's not allowed and dad has to let the 15 year old do whatever she wants, but this dad does not parent that way.", "No, stereotypes are rarely based on precedence the way that you're trying to imply.  \"Women are bad drivers\", \"black people like watermelon\" \"Asians are good at math\" are all examples of stereotypes that aren't well supported the way that \"man divorces wife #1 and then remarries a significantly younger wife because he's trading in for a younger, hotter, more naive model the way he would a car\" has been statistically supported. They're not remotely trying to claim all divorced men do this. Just men who do this, do this.", "Again, given that OP points out that he's taken the actual news very well indeed, what is the reason he should be looking inward for?", "\"Bigot\" doesn't mean 'doesn't agree with me.'\n\nStepmother should have told stepdaughter that she wasn't comfortable keeping secrets from dad, and that step daughter shouldn't ask people to keep secrets from their other loved ones.  It simply isn't fair to expect people to be in the middle like that.", "There\u2019s literally only one rule when it comes to other people\u2019s sexuality, and it is that you DO NOT OUT THEM. EVER.", "> \"Women are bad drivers\", \"black people like watermelon\" \"Asians are good at math\" are all examples of stereotypes that aren't well supported the way that \"man divorces wife #1 and then remarries a significantly younger wife because he's trading in for a younger, hotter, more naive model the way he would a car\" has been statistically supported.\n\nso your justification is that stereotypes aren't *true enough*, whereas what you're saying is?\n\nthe \"black people like watermelons\" stereotype came about after emancipation. freed slaves often grew watermelons as a cash crop or for self-sufficiency. racists got upset at the sight of the freed slaves and their self-reliance, and began labeling watermelons as a lazy and unclean food in retaliation. are you going to rewrite black history just so you can justify your stereotype?", "He should be looking inward for why he got angry at his wife for refusing to betray the trust of his daughter, something not easily earned as a stepparent", "Speaking as someone who had to come out to his parents, and as a teacher who has students come out to me pretty frequently, your point is 100% irrelevant.\n\nWhen a student comes out to me, it stays with me. End of story. It's the daughter's journey to make, and having control of that process taken away from you is incredibly invalidating and hurts like hell. Even in this case, where there was not necessarily any danger of a negative reaction, a kid should never be outed to anyone **they were not ready to tell**, and their own reasons for being ready or not are theirs, and are always valid.\n\nYou need, I say with respect, to re-evaluate your position on this one, because it goes against everything we know about queer/trans kids and their healthy emotional development.", "That is the one rule about other people's sexuality? Wild. Wild stuff. Guess OP has her answer.", "You are twisting my words. My point is that it's a \"stereotype\" but clearly not based on reality which is how stereotypes typically go. No one should use stereotypes to make judgements about people. \n\nMen remarrying younger women isn't a stereotype because it's a literal observation. \ud83d\ude44"]}
