Looking at his attitude there\u2019s probably a good reason she delayed in telling him before you snd her bio mother.\n\nGood on you for being the safe parent", "NTA. Your husband is being a big baby because his daughter was more comfortable with you than him.", "NTA\n\nYou absolutely did the right thing and proved to be a good and safe person for your step-daugther, she know she can confide in you\n\nIf you had told her father against her will, it would have been outing, which is always a big no no.", "NTA. It's never okay to out someone. People deserve to come our whenever they're comfortable and it's not up to anyone but them. This isn't one of those \"you need to tell me this\" situations at all. Your husband needs to take a step back and realize this isn't about him.", "NTA - it's on your SD to say when/where she will be comfortable with telling ANYONE about their sexuality.  Your husband is AH for giving you the cold shoulder.  You just did what was asked.", "NTA. \n\nYou did the right thing here, 100% and you've proven to your stepdaughter that yet again, you are another safe adult in her life who will respect her.\n\nI suspect that this situation with your husband has less to do with you not telling him and more about him being the last to know. Not to mention, its a huge part of his daughter he didn't know until recently. \n\nHold your stance, because its the correct one.", "NTA. You are 100% right and he's being 100% pissy little baby.", "NTA. You were absolutely right to respect your Stepdaughter's confidence.\n\nThere are situations where it might have been appropriate to break her confidence (if she was in immediate danger, for instance) but this absolutely was not one of them. 'I want to know' isn't a valid reason to betray a confidence., and a parent is not entitled to know everything about their child, particularly once the child is old enough to make personal decisions, including about who they trust with sensitive information. \n\nIt would have been a huge breach of trust and probably ruined your relationship with her had you broken her confidence. \n\nIt's says a lot for your relationship that she trusted you enough to tell you first, it may also have been that she felt she could 'test the water' with you as you aren't her biological parent, you reacting well may well have been part of why she felt about to then tell her parents. \n\nIt's understandable that your husband's feeling were hurt, but honestly, if he isn't able to understand that you respected boundaries in a totally appropriate way, that might be part of why his daughter was cautious about telling him, she perhaps knows from experiences that she can't necessarily rely on him to respect her .\n\nI hope he is able to get over himself and be that you did the right thing, and that he has no right to expect you to betray a confidence, even (perhaps especially) of his child.", "NTA. Everyone deserves to come out on their own terms, she specifically asked you not to say anything as she was already working up the courage to tell her parents. Weird of him to deflect his feelings onto you. How did he take the news??", "Nta\n\nYou did the right thing. Your husband is wrong", "NTA. \nAnd quick note; good on you, OP for obviously being a bonus parent that your stepdaughter trusts! I understand that your husband may be hurt that his child didn\u2019t come out to him right away. *However*, instead of being mad at you for abstaining from outing information that wasn\u2019t yours to share, he should feel lucky that he married someone that his daughter obviously trusts, loves, and respects. \n\nYou did the right thing, OP.", "NTA.  Your husband is being an ass and probably feels like his child can't trust him.  It's a bit of a gut punch to realize you are the last to know something regarding your child.  Give him a bit more time to get over his sulk and then sit him down.  He needs to communicate with you.  Explain, again, that all you had in mind was stepdaughter's mental health and wellbeing.  She trusted you with this and you would never betray that trust.  Keeping her trust is paramount because if it's broken, then she'll never come to you again.  And likely never trust her dad again either by proxy.\n\nIf he digs in his heels then it's time to bring up counseling.", "nta", "NTA\n\nHis reaction shows why he's the last one his daughter told!\nAnd that her mother takes it with more graces that the step mother knew it first, shows you do an amazing job. Keep up the good teamwork with her. :)", "Sounds like he's upset she trusted him least. Why doesn't he work on being a more safe figure for his daughter instead of projecting his anger on you?", "NTA. You did the right ty think. \nYour stepdaugther need some adult to Trust, and in these case was you. \nYou respect her wises.\nIf her father dont understand its his problem, not yours.", "NAH\n\nYou were in position in which there was no good out.  \n\nIt was good to respect the girl's wishes.  \n\nIt is also understandable that a spouse would feel hurt - hurt that his daughter didn't trust him with the news, hurt that that his partner knew something he didn't, which is a pretty big secret to keep between partners, and sort of left out.  Give him a chance to process. He's not the asshole for processing all this.  \n\nI don't think taking your marital issues outside the marriage to the ex wife is a good idea.", "NAH\n\nYou were put in an impossible situation. You had to keep her secret. But at the same time, keeping secrets from your partner is bad - let alone something huge about his child. So you chose to prioritise the feelings of the most vulnerable person. I can't fault you for that. I see why he was hurt, but you did good.", "NTA, and you might getting a taste of why they divorced.", ">I thought I did the right thing but now I don\u2019t know. Maybe my husband is right and I should\u2019ve told him.\n\nMaybe.\n\nMaybe not.\n\nI assume that your stepdaughter has already had \"the talk\" in a way comprehensive enough to cover bad romances in general (which is a big assumption). But that is not your question. Your question is about telling her father about coming out.\n\nI believe the only benefit to telling your husband would be to make a better or more accurate decision about how to discuss sexual or romantic safety with your stepdaughter. I don't dismiss either choice. NAH.", "YTA.\n\nNot for keeping your sted daughter's secret but for dismissing how your husband feels and for going to his ex to justify your position. \n\nYour husband feels a way about being the last one to know. He is hurt by this. This doesn't mean that you should have betrayed your step-daughter's trust, but you sure as hell could have been more understanding towards your husband. \n\nHis daughter just shared something very important with him, and he was the last to know. Right or wrong, being the last to know hurt his feelings.  \n\nSeeking validation by texting his ex was unnecessary, and it was dismissive of his feelings and his right to have them. \n\nYou are also dragging your husband's ex into the conversation.\n\nWho does that?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm a father and I would not react the same way he did... How he responded was pathetic", "The daughters feelings come first. I'm a father and I would not react the same way he did...
