I invited my entire friend group plus their partners, one of my friend takes her dog everywhere. I told her no pets were allowed. Although it was a garden party we were in and out of my home and I have 4 cats. My cats do not like dogs and neither do I.\n\nAnyway my friend showed up with her dog, I told her that her dog was not welcome in my home or garden. And asked her to please take her dog home or elsewhere. \n\nI thought my friend left. I went inside to sort some things out. I went into my garden about 15 minutes later and my friend was standing there in my garden talking to our friends. She doesn\u2019t live that close so I was confused. \n\nI went to ask her how she got back so quickly, she told me she just popped in and was going since her dog isn\u2019t welcome. I asked her where her dog is and she shrugged her shoulders and said he was around. \n\nI went looking and found him at the bottom of the garden eating my crops and making a mess. I was angry and told my friend to get her dog off my property. \n\nA few hours later she called me asking me what her dog ate, I had no clue. My gardener plants and attends everything, I told her I didn\u2019t know, but told her he\u2019d made a huge mess, dug things up and clearly eaten things. \n\nShe shouted at me that her dog is sick and that I need to find out what the dog ate. I told her I had no idea, but I\u2019d text my gardener to ask, but it was really her problem. \n\nI did send the text, but my gardener didn\u2019t answer. My friend called again wanting to know what her dog ate, but I told her I still didn\u2019t know. She told me I obviously don\u2019t care if her dog dies and called me an AH.\n\nI still don\u2019t know what her dog ate, but apparently he is very sick and might die. I feel bad, but I told her not to bring her dog on my property so I don\u2019t feel responsible like she says I am. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - After being unable to reach my gardener I took pictures of everything the dog dug up, which was a lot and sent them to my friend, but I have no idea what it ate and what it just dug up and for all I know what it ate isn\u2019t even pictured because the whole section is a mess. This wasn\u2019t good enough for her, she wants me to tell her exactly what it ate and I just don\u2019t know and don\u2019t want to spend hours trying to figure it out when I don\u2019t even know if it can be figured out.", "created_utc": 1684173566, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ifaxs/aita_for_not_being_upset_that_my_friends_dog/", "score": 1205, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Overly entitled negligent dog owner may have killed her dog. Simple as that. It sounds harsh but that's what's happened. An animal will pay the price for her not being fit to care for anything other than herself. \n\nHonestly I'd say now is the time to state clearly in text that she was told not to bring her dog, brought her dog and was told to leave, didn't leave, let her dog off leash and wasn't supervising her animal when this happened. It's important her negligence is stated plainly to her incase she decides to play silly buggers later.", "this made me sooo mad. your friend is an incredible AH and an awful dog owner... how could she just let her dog wander around and not keep an eye on him, when she should know that her dog is prone to eating stuff?! that is just incredibly irresponsible to her own pet! \n\nand this is not to mention that she let her dog off the leash in the home of someone who clearly told her dogs are not welcome. \n\noverall NTA, but for the dogs sake you may have put a bit more effort into finding out what he could've ate. it's not the poor dog's fault that he has an idiotic owner", "NTA Just fyi, there is an app called Picture This.

Quite frankly even if you allowed her to bring her dog, if he cannot be trusted to not dig up and eat plants in a garden the dog should be on a leash and the owner needs to watch him the whole time.

I am so sorry for the dog, and both of you suffering over this. \n\nIn my experience a lot of times the vet will want to talk to the owner of the property that the dog ate stuff on to a specific questions or at least have a member of their staff ask the specific questions that might help them figure out a cause, as then hasn't happened either the vet is leaving it all up to them or as stated previously I worry that it hasn't been taken to the vet.\n\nAs an added note thank you for being a responsible cat owner and keeping your cats indoors.

As a matter of fact either you or the friend could probably post the pictures to gardening subreddits and have people flood in with this plan is this as a fun project for them much better than trying to ask a person who has no idea about plants and was not watching their dog what their dog ate while it was unwatched.
