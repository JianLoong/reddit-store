I invited my entire friend group plus their partners, one of my friend takes her dog everywhere. I told her no pets were allowed. Although it was a garden party we were in and out of my home and I have 4 cats. My cats do not like dogs and neither do I.\n\nAnyway my friend showed up with her dog, I told her that her dog was not welcome in my home or garden. And asked her to please take her dog home or elsewhere. \n\nI thought my friend left. I went inside to sort some things out. I went into my garden about 15 minutes later and my friend was standing there in my garden talking to our friends. She doesn\u2019t live that close so I was confused. \n\nI went to ask her how she got back so quickly, she told me she just popped in and was going since her dog isn\u2019t welcome. I asked her where her dog is and she shrugged her shoulders and said he was around. \n\nI went looking and found him at the bottom of the garden eating my crops and making a mess. I was angry and told my friend to get her dog off my property. \n\nA few hours later she called me asking me what her dog ate, I had no clue. My gardener plants and attends everything, I told her I didn\u2019t know, but told her he\u2019d made a huge mess, dug things up and clearly eaten things. \n\nShe shouted at me that her dog is sick and that I need to find out what the dog ate. I told her I had no idea, but I\u2019d text my gardener to ask, but it was really her problem. \n\nI did send the text, but my gardener didn\u2019t answer. My friend called again wanting to know what her dog ate, but I told her I still didn\u2019t know. She told me I obviously don\u2019t care if her dog dies and called me an AH.\n\nI still don\u2019t know what her dog ate, but apparently he is very sick and might die. I feel bad, but I told her not to bring her dog on my property so I don\u2019t feel responsible like she says I am. \n\nAITA?\n\nETA - After being unable to reach my gardener I took pictures of everything the dog dug up, which was a lot and sent them to my friend, but I have no idea what it ate and what it just dug up and for all I know what it ate isn\u2019t even pictured because the whole section is a mess. This wasn\u2019t good enough for her, she wants me to tell her exactly what it ate and I just don\u2019t know and don\u2019t want to spend hours trying to figure it out when I don\u2019t even know if it can be figured out.", "created_utc": 1684173566, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ifaxs/aita_for_not_being_upset_that_my_friends_dog/", "score": 9574, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Overly entitled negligent dog owner may have killed her dog. Simple as that. It sounds harsh but that's what's happened.

I am so sorry for the dog, and both of you suffering over this. \n\nIn my experience a lot of times the vet will want to talk to the owner of the property that the dog ate stuff on to a specific questions or at least have a member of their staff ask the specific questions that might help them figure out a cause, as then hasn't happened either the vet is leaving it all up to them or as stated previously I worry that it hasn't been taken to the vet.\n\nAs an added note thank you for being a responsible cat owner and keeping your cats indoors.

As a matter of fact either you or the friend could probably post the pictures to gardening subreddits and have people flood in with this plan is this as a fun project for them much better than trying to ask a person who has no idea about plants and was not watching their dog what their dog ate while it was unwatched.

My dog is a medium dog, not as well behaved as I\u2019d like, but is sweet and friendly and cute (and knows it), so he also gets invited a lot.\n\nAnd even at dog friendly houses where I\u2019m encouraged to let him off leash (so he can play with their dogs. Did I mention my dog\u2019s legitimately friendly and sweet?), I\u2019m *still* actively keeping an eye on him so he doesn\u2019t jump on people or eat something he\u2019s not supposed to or cause damage to my friends\u2019 property or himself. And if they don\u2019t have dogs of their own, or just an electric fence, he\u2019s on leash by me the whole time.\n\nI cannot imagine just letting him roam around someone else\u2019s yard without knowing he\u2019d be safe.", "I\u2019m pretty sure if people thought they\u2019d be able to, and they were forced to only have one invitation to my household, my dog would be the sole invitee.\n\nHowever she\u2019s a 20 month old Shiba Inu, so she\u2019s goddamn adorable, and I understand the appeal.\n\nBut I get it. I would in no way let my dog out of my sight, because she\u2019s a cheeky bugger and shiba are known to chase into the horizon at no notice.", "Theres that story about a dog that naps at someone's house daily for a few weeks. The nap host eventually sent a note on the dog's collar inquiring about who owns the dog and informing them the dog naps daily at her house.  The next day he arrived with a note saying that he lives with 6 kids and mom asked if she can come with him tomorrow.", "Could have been slug bait. I was advised not to use it since I have pets. Dogs are especially attracted to slug bait and it can poison them. I don't have my dog anymore (RIP) but I still have a cat so I still won't use it just in case.", "No telling.\n\nCould have been something it ate before it got to her house\n\nOr after she left, since it was fine right before she left"]}
