Overly entitled negligent dog owner may have killed her dog. Simple as that. It sounds harsh but that's what's happened. An animal will pay the price for her not being fit to care for anything other than herself. \n\nHonestly I'd say now is the time to state clearly in text that she was told not to bring her dog, brought her dog and was told to leave, didn't leave, let her dog off leash and wasn't supervising her animal when this happened.

Quite frankly even if you allowed her to bring her dog, if he cannot be trusted to not dig up and eat plants in a garden the dog should be on a leash and the owner needs to watch him the whole time. I am a dog lover and never mind when there are free roaming dogs at a party (I'd rather hang with them than humans most times), but it's not enjoyable when the dogs are poorly behaved. I still don't even mind a poorly behaved dog being at a party, but then the owner needs to be vigilant. I'm sorry this happened bc I'm sure you'll feel bad if the dog dies even if you don't like dogs, but she should have kept an eye on her dog.

Your friend is an irresponsible idiot, her dog been unwell is totally on her. You told her not to bring the dog, she ignored you. You asked her to take the dog home, she ignored you. Everything that happened to that dog is her fault. The only thing I would have done differently if I was you would have been to send her pictures of the plants in the area the dog was eating when your gardener didn\u2019t reply as vets will recognise the ones that are bad or can look it up and that might give the dog a better chance of getting better.

At the end of the day it's an animal and it are something it shouldn't. It'd be surprising if it actually died", "How do you take a photo of plants that are not there because the dog has eaten them. If the op didn\u2019t put them in then only the gardener knows what they were before they were eaten.", "Yeah mate here's a picture of a hole in the ground where a plant once was hope it helps", "Depending on the lay out of the garden and how much of a mess things are, that won\u2019t be much help. Many plants look alike for people who aren\u2019t familiar with them, and he could have eaten all the ones in that area and no longer be present.", "I wouldn't blame her at all.", "Oh damn I didn\u2019t even think about the system counting, thanks for letting me know, will edit it!", "If your cats have access to your garden I think it's important to find out what plants you have there regardless", "God please don\u2019t do that!! You\u2019re NTA in the situation as is, but think of your cats.  How would you feel if the situation was reversed and were asked for compensation when your pet was dying.\n\nYour friend is an irresponsible dog owner.  That\u2019s not on you, but the death of a pet is devastating.  I\u2019m hoping you know that since you have four cats.\n\nIt literally makes me ill thinking about billing your friend for lost plants.  She\u2019s probably guilt ridden enough, as is.  Please don\u2019t become the AH in an incredibly sad situation.\n\nEdit word", "Darth Sidious voice: Do it!", "But that\u2019s not what happened. I said OP is on their high horse because they aren\u2019t helping find out what the dog ate. That wouldn\u2019t apply in any other situation. I\u2019m responding to what occurred. Your comment makes no sense. I agreed that\u2019s it the owners fault for putting the dog in the situation, but OP can do more to help after the fact as it isn\u2019t the dog fault\u2019s either and it\u2019s their life that is compromised. Any animal lover I would have thought would care at least that much.", "You\u2019re spot on. I couldn\u2019t put it better myself", "Go look?\n\nIf the tomato plants are torn up it was probably tomatoes. \n\nIf it was onions then\u2026 probably onions. Might have been what made the dog sick!\n\nIt isn\u2019t unreasonable to ask to take a look and use common sense.", "She can go take a look and see what plants are torn up and make an educated guess. \n\nThat\u2019s a pretty reasonable thing to do if there\u2019s a dying dog involved.", "OP could have taken a peek at the garden and seen what plants were torn up and made an easy educated guess in 2 minutes.\n\nEdit: How is this unreasonable?! Lmao", "So? OP hasn\u2019t stated that. That\u2019s all conjecture that a photo won\u2019t help. Presumably since this happened over the last day, the plants are somewhere like the trash if they are no longer in the garden. It\u2019s ok if she says it could have been any of these plants in the photo. It\u2019s at least a baseline for the vet.", "I'd be looking for daffodils and lilies. Allium plants, including onions, aren't great for cats or dogs. Edit: Friend recently lost a pup and it was initially felt poisoning due to these but was sadly congential. Vets can treat but hit and miss.", "It doesn't sound like the friend feels an ounce of guilt at all and is instead blaming OP for her own actions.  Both the dog's suffering and the damage to OP's property is 100% her fault and OP should absolutely bill her for it.", "OP tried to find out.", "Op stated they contacted the gardner, but hasnt recieved anything back. They shouldn't have to spend their time trying to help a selfish owner. She needs to take it to a vet and deal with the consequences of her actions herself. True animal lovers don't just sit around and blame others instead of taking immediate action.", "A text isn\u2019t really much. If it were my friend,\nI would do a lot more, even if I was annoyed at them for the whole situation", "The course of action the veterinarian needs to take may depend on what has been ingested. Only the OP has a direct line to the gardener. The friend has no way of finding out. So yeah it\u2019s sucks because the dog may die because the OP didn\u2019t make more of an effort. That directly implicates them in the dog\u2019s death. I would hope that no matter how much of an arsehole I had been, a friend would make the one phone call I needed to potentially save my dog\u2019s life", "The dog should never have been there. Period. OP is not responsible for someone else's bad choices and yes it might help but vets are equipped to test for multiple reasons and they have extensive knowledge of what is toxic to dogs. Also how do you know the Gardner would have more information since the dog ate \"stuff\" not a single plant? It could have gotten sick from the dirt and have nothing to do with the garden. Shouldn't blame others for being careless and FYI most places want dogs on a leash, the owner didn't have control of their dog so they would be automatically guilty of the results", "Please read my responses. I said the OP is not responsible. I agree with you in all of that. So please stop arguing for the sake of arguing. \n\nOP could have done more to help someone who was supposedly their \u201cfriend\u201d, even if they were annoyed at them. Sorry in this situation, they weren\u2019t faultless because of that. \n\nWhat I am saying has nothing to do with who\u2019s responsibility the dog is, that\u2019s a completely separate issue, which everyone in this sub, me included, agrees on. But, it\u2019s not a black and white situation. There are nuances. And being right in one situation (the party) does not absolve you of acting rubbish in one connected to it (how OP acted after)."]}
