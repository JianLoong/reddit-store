If the neighborhood has congested parking, you may be the latest in a long history of people parking in front of her driveway.  Maybe you have to call and ask that they bring your kids out to you while you are with your car.", "Yes YTA you can\u2019t block people\u2019s driveways. From your post it sounds like you blocked her in if you were expecting her to leave after you moved.", "YTA. Find somewhere else to park instead of blocking someone\u2019s driveway. What she was likely mad about is IF she needed to get in and out for her husband. Being blocked in causes anxiety for a lot of people whether she \u201cleft immediately\u201d or not you had no right. The same way you felt enough anxiety to block someone\u2019s driveway illegally just for 5 minutes to get your kids.", "YTA \n\nIts common sense to any driver not to block driveways", "YTA.  It doesn't matter if you think she needed to leave \"right then\" or not.  The point is, you've effectively trapped them.  They have no way of knowing how long the car will be there or where the driver is.    \n\n\nMassively uncool.", "Sorry yta. You should have called the babysitter to bring them out. Never block someone's driveway. \n\nMy neighbors had a party and some guy parked right in front of our driveway blocking it completely. I yelled for my husband to call the police. The person ran right out (there were plenty of parking)", "YTA\n\nYou were in the wrong, full stop, no exceptions.  Further, I understand that you didn't appreciate how she spoke in front of your children, but if I can be honest, I have no sympathy, because that would be your fault as well.  You don't get to do something wrong and then dictate how the other person gets to be angry about it.  Especially if you have children involved.  Do better next time.", "YTA. \n\nI live in a neighborhood with a school and a daycare and people block my driveway day and night. \n\nI leave nasty notes on the cars and call a tow truck. \n\nThe self-absorption necessary to think it's ok to block someone's drive way is disgusting.", "Honestly? There's a tow guy that lives 2 streets down. I could of had em here and your car gone in that 5 minutes. \n\nBlocking a driveway is ALWAYS an AH move. Don't know why you think you were entitled to park there just because you have kids.\n\nAnd her swearing in front of your kids? You only have yourself to be mad at because it was your own doing.\n\nYTA. Don't do it again", "YTA\n\nIn certain situations five minutes can be a long time.", "YTA\n\nDon\u2019t block people\u2019s driveways.", "YTA\n\n>I had parked for a quick 5 minutes\n\n>This was also the first time parking in that spot\n\nThese kind of statements and others that people use to justify them being inconsiderate and sometimes leaving people in danger situations are meant to minimize their actions. It's kind of like when people say \"no one else complained\"\n\nWhat gives you the right to put someone else in that position? You know when you're doing it it's wrong and you're at that point knowingly putting yourself above everyone else.... Entitled is the word that comes to mind.", "YTA- yup. doesnt matter why or for how long.", "Yta and it was a selfish move. Don\u2019t do stuff like that. Granted she was s jerk too but you started it. Do better and don\u2019t block driveways even for a short time with blinkers on.", "YTA.\n\nIt doesn't matter how long you were there. You have no right to block someone's driveway. If parking in front of wherever isn't available, it's your responsibility to drive around and find a place to park your car and walk.", "YTA. It isn't legal to block someone's driveway. What if in that five minutes an ambulance had needed access to the \"old sick husband?\" Honestly...try to think of others.", "YTA. Don\u2019t block people\u2019s driveways. So my neighbor across the street has a long history of visitors blocking my driveway. Sometimes it\u2019s just the Uber driver idling. I never yell or curse. And only say anything if I\u2019m getting ready to leave. But I\u2019m probably seeming irritated and snarky at the poor Uber driver who may be on his first pick up the address. But seriously (in my case drive 30 freaking feet make a uturn and block his driveway)", "YTA. Even if her husband wasn't ill/disabled. It's always bad to do this, even for 5 minutes.", "Yes. Obviously YTA. Even in your comments you say you don't want anyone parking near your driveway so. Yes. Obviously.", "YTA. Don't block driveways.", "Yta", "YTA.  It is rude to block anyone\u2019s driveway for any reason.  And it doesn\u2019t matter if the woman was leaving her home or not.  It is her home and her driveway, and you have no right to block it.", "YTA. Don't block people's driveways.", "YTA. There was no excuse for blocking her driveway.", "YTA. It\u2019s also illegal. Park further away and walk.", "You are the TA. I'm not going to bag you as you know what you did was wrong. You do not block someone's driveway for any reason unless you are driving an emergency vehicle and you are saving a life - picking children up is not this situation. It doesn't matter if it was for 5 minutes or 30 minutes, it is also illegal in a lot of places. Best practice, you learned a lesson and don't do it again. Don't dwell on it anymore - you made a mistake, humans do.", "I know you didn\u2019t mean to, but next time try to be more aware of your surroundings and how where you park could affect the people who live in that area.", "YTA for saying \"a quick five minutes\". Five minutes is a dsfinite length of time, it's not variable.", "YTA. It's illegal to Block driveways.", "YTA If you're going to do this, why wouldn't you block the babysitters driveway at least?? Don't inconvenience others just because you're in a rush.\n\nYou do know this is the same thing people always say when they park in a disabled parking spaces too right? those people are massive AH imo.", "ESH, You shouldn't have blocked her driveway, she shouldn't lose her shit on a stranger in fromt of their kids. Also, fuck everyone in these comments making it a big deal. Bunch of lunatics the lot of them.", "NAH. You got caught and ran. That's what you're supposed to do. That's all.", "NTA. 5 mins is a completely normal time to leave your car and pickup your kids.

Second of all is an asshole thing to do. For all you know when that 5 minutes somebody could have had a heart attack and they couldn't get out of the driveway. Don't be using your kids as an excuse to block private property. That makes you even more of an asshole trying to use them as an excuse like you think just because you gave birth now you're entitled to do whatever the hell you want and laws don't apply to you", "YTA.\n\nYou knew you shouldn't have parked there, and you knew you were blocking part of the driveway.  I'd have had blocked you in and you towed, you're lucky she didn't.", "yeah man i thought of that too and felt really bad, its just the fact that she was cussing right in front of my kids which i did not like lol.", "she had enough room to back out of but completely understandable i wouldnt want anyone parking near my driveway.", "yup i was in a rush, but no excuses. babysitter said its public parking anyway (which parking in front of the driveway is illegal i read everything about lines and all after this incident lmao) though i should have known better.", "they definitely had space to come out.

Definitely my first and last time making a mistake like this again.", "I didn\u2019t think ahead and was in a rush, having kids is no excuse but the neighborhood road is very narrow, i couldnt even park on the other side (where there are no cars) if i wanted to since i would be blocking the whole road. and it was the only spot i could get. but you are right.", "And it's never really 5 minutes.", "good on you for keeping it cool, just wished she hadn\u2019t cursed in front of my children.", "yes. obviously. from my comments lol, i just wanted to see what people would say about this whole incident since i thought 5 minutes was fine in a moment of hurry. But. Obviously. Lesson. Learned. Never Park Near Anyones.

Still YTA.", "Well you blocked her from leaving her property, those five minutes could\u2019ve killed her husband.", "It's your fault she was cursing to begin with", "YTA. You know you shouldn\u2019t do it but did it anyway. Park down the street and walk to get your kids. Teach them to respect other peoples property.", "As a general rule, I try to control my anger when someone's with their kids. Kids should not see their parents being treated with disrespect. It's an ESH because she should have spoken politely, even if with frustration and annoyance, because you don't, presumably, have a history of doing wrong. I can understand her outburst. But it's not great to unleash the pent up anger on someone who has no history of being inconsiderate.", "The thing you are missing is the fact that chronically ill people have to go to the hospital sometimes with no warning. You say she could have gotten by, but if all the parkable space was taken, she likely wouldn't have been able to turn her car once she backed out. (This happens to me all the time and my hubby goes nuts on people too. What if your \"5 minutes\" is what kills someone?)\n\nYTA", "Then you should have understood why you were the asshole in this situation.", "I appreciate that.

Just because you, a young person with healthy young eyesight and reactions, saw it as enough space, doesn't mean an older person, with potentially diminished eyesight and reaction times would see it the same way.", "That's what I was thinking. Five minutes to ONLY grab the kids, sure. Assuming they're in their coats, have all belongings gathered when you arrive, and don't want to show you anything. Oh, and that nobody tries to talk to you while you're there.", "You were most likely the last straw.  If that road is busy this probably isn't the first time that someone has blocked her driveway.

You drive until you find a spot, if there are none you drive further away.", "blocking someone's driveway IS NOT A PARKING SPACE\n\nit's not \"where you could park\", you can't park there!\n\nwhat would you do if I blocked you from leaving your parking space 'just for a few mins'. imagine you're in a hurry for an appointment, or trying to take your kid to the hospital for an emergency. how would you react? \n\nhopefully in defense of a loved one you'd tell me to get the fuck out of your way!\n\nYTA in so many ways."]}
