{"id": 12752, "submission_id": "11wjaks", "title": "AITA for demanding my father respect my step-son's pronouns?", "selftext": "So recently I married an absolutely wonderful woman and in the process gained an even more wonderful son! Cole (name changed for privacy) identifies as nonbinary and uses they/he pronouns. I of course have no issue with this and support him fully, as does his mother and most of the family. The past few months have been spent introducing Cole to my side of the family with all being very welcoming to him. All except my dad. My dad is\u2026lets just say a bit conservative. I wouldn't call him a bad guy. He's just stubborn and very in his own ways. But when I told him I had gotten married to a woman with a kid, he was delighted to get the chance to meet Cole. Going in, I made sure Cole was aware Mt sad may not be the most supportive of people and that seeing him is entirely up to him, Cole says he wants to meet my dad either way but I remind him he can opt out at any time.\n\n\nWe make the drive over and all seems to go well at first. The two hit it off, everyone's having a good time, all seems to be well. Then my dad points to a pin Cole had been wearing that had he/they on it. He asks what it meant and Cole responds saying those are his pronouns. My dad responds back saying that he didn't believe in all that \"pronouns nonsense\" and that Cole was not a boy. Cole and I are both taken aback by this but I state firmly and calmly that Cole prefers to be called by he or they. Cole isn't too phased thankfully so we just continue on like nothing happened, like I said, pops is pretty conservative and Cole knew as much going into this so both of us expected him to be a bit resistant. He's not being outright malicious, he does see Cole as a grandson, he's just too stubborn to refer to Cole by he/they.\n\n\nAs the day goes on, he continually calls Cole a girl and by she/her pronouns which was starting to make him very uncomfortable. After a bit I decide to cut this short, I tell Cole to wait in the car while I have a private conversation with my dad. I immediately tell my dad what he did was not cool. He asks why and I try to keep my composure while explaining that Cole is a boy, full stop. Cole deserves to be referred to as such. Dad isn't budging though and says while he seems like a nice kid, he's not partaking in Cole's \"delusions\". It's pretty clear being polite wasn't going to cut it so I had to be blunt with him. I told him to either use he/they when referring to Cole or he can forget about seeing either of us. My dad doesn't like this one bit but I stand my ground. \n\n\nI promptly leave and tell him he's welcome to give me a call if he's ready to treat Cole with the respect he is due. During the ride home, I am absolutely apologetic to Cole for all this. My dad is family like anyone else but he has no right talking to Cole like that.

I am so glad Cole has you to stand up for him and protect him.\n\nYour dad is deeply set in his ways.  He has been trained by years of extreme right wing talking points to think a certain way, and I think that will take time to untrain.  In fact, having a relationship with Cole may be just the way to help him come around.  It is one thing to dehumanize someone you have never met, and quite another to do it when it is someone you have come to know and love.   Whether your dad believes Cole is a he or not, those actions will cause Cole pain, and I would hope your dad would not want to cause pain to someone he has come to know and love.  Especially as he sees just how much pain that causes.  Hopefully he'll come to see  that Cole is more important than being \"right\"  So there's a real opportunity here where he can change.  \n\nBut, and this is a huge but, Cole needs to be the one in control here.  If he wants to still continue getting to know your father that is great.  If he wants no contact that is great too.  It's all about him at this point.   And at the very least this was probably a good learning experience for Cole, even if hurtful.

Just because he can\u2019t comprehend another person\u2019s experience with gender and gender expression doesn\u2019t mean you have to endure his behavior with your son in law.

And sometimes the first steps in a change of acceptance are not pretty. But that is up to Cole. My dad was hella racist\u2026.until this generation of my family came along.

That's a pretty big detail to live out if it's the case. \n\nNTA, I guess, but I don't know why we're expecting everyone to just indulge and immediately adapt to this stuff and getting so damn upset about it.
