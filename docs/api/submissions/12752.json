{"id": 12752, "submission_id": "11wjaks", "title": "AITA for demanding my father respect my step-son's pronouns?", "selftext": "So recently I married an absolutely wonderful woman and in the process gained an even more wonderful son! Cole (name changed for privacy) identifies as nonbinary and uses they/he pronouns. I of course have no issue with this and support him fully, as does his mother and most of the family. The past few months have been spent introducing Cole to my side of the family with all being very welcoming to him. All except my dad. My dad is\u2026lets just say a bit conservative. I wouldn't call him a bad guy. He's just stubborn and very in his own ways. But when I told him I had gotten married to a woman with a kid, he was delighted to get the chance to meet Cole. Going in, I made sure Cole was aware Mt sad may not be the most supportive of people and that seeing him is entirely up to him, Cole says he wants to meet my dad either way but I remind him he can opt out at any time.\n\n\nWe make the drive over and all seems to go well at first. The two hit it off, everyone's having a good time, all seems to be well. Then my dad points to a pin Cole had been wearing that had he/they on it. He asks what it meant and Cole responds saying those are his pronouns. My dad responds back saying that he didn't believe in all that \"pronouns nonsense\" and that Cole was not a boy. Cole and I are both taken aback by this but I state firmly and calmly that Cole prefers to be called by he or they. Cole isn't too phased thankfully so we just continue on like nothing happened, like I said, pops is pretty conservative and Cole knew as much going into this so both of us expected him to be a bit resistant. He's not being outright malicious, he does see Cole as a grandson, he's just too stubborn to refer to Cole by he/they.\n\n\nAs the day goes on, he continually calls Cole a girl and by she/her pronouns which was starting to make him very uncomfortable. After a bit I decide to cut this short, I tell Cole to wait in the car while I have a private conversation with my dad. I immediately tell my dad what he did was not cool. He asks why and I try to keep my composure while explaining that Cole is a boy, full stop. Cole deserves to be referred to as such. Dad isn't budging though and says while he seems like a nice kid, he's not partaking in Cole's \"delusions\". It's pretty clear being polite wasn't going to cut it so I had to be blunt with him. I told him to either use he/they when referring to Cole or he can forget about seeing either of us. My dad doesn't like this one bit but I stand my ground. \n\n\nI promptly leave and tell him he's welcome to give me a call if he's ready to treat Cole with the respect he is due. During the ride home, I am absolutely apologetic to Cole for all this. My dad is family like anyone else but he has no right talking to Cole like that. Part of me worries I was too harsh.\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679319963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wjaks/aita_for_demanding_my_father_respect_my_stepsons/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am so glad Cole has you to stand up for him and protect him.\n\nYour dad is deeply set in his ways.  He has been trained by years of extreme right wing talking points to think a certain way, and I think that will take time to untrain.  In fact, having a relationship with Cole may be just the way to help him come around.  It is one thing to dehumanize someone you have never met, and quite another to do it when it is someone you have come to know and love.   Whether your dad believes Cole is a he or not, those actions will cause Cole pain, and I would hope your dad would not want to cause pain to someone he has come to know and love.  Especially as he sees just how much pain that causes.  Hopefully he'll come to see  that Cole is more important than being \"right\"  So there's a real opportunity here where he can change.  \n\nBut, and this is a huge but, Cole needs to be the one in control here.  If he wants to still continue getting to know your father that is great.  If he wants no contact that is great too.  It's all about him at this point.   And at the very least this was probably a good learning experience for Cole, even if hurtful.  This is probably not the last time he will meet someone with this shitty attitude.", "I\u2019m a little confused, because apparently Cole uses they/them but you refer them Cole as \u201che/him\u201d the entire post", "NTA \n\nStart calling you dad by his name instead of dad or by his middle name or something.. when he complains you can show him the hypocrisy.", "It costs *absolutely nothing* to address and refer to people how they would like to be addressed and referred to.

What goes around comes around.", "NTA. \nI know from how you stated it that you were calm and composed the whole time while talking to your dad. Just because he can\u2019t comprehend another person\u2019s experience with gender and gender expression doesn\u2019t mean you have to endure his behavior with your son in law. Dad needs to grow out of some dated ideologies. Give him the time he needs and hopefully he\u2019ll try to educate himself (and try to understand empathy).", "NTA.

Cole has the right to be authentic. Thank you for supporting them.

And sometimes the first steps in a change of acceptance are not pretty. But that is up to Cole. My dad was hella racist\u2026.until this generation of my family came along. My stepsister married her wife in 1994 (civil union) and adopted a Black baby (who is now in college). My direct sib married and had kids in a mixed marriage. Dad finally grew up and it was nice.", "NTA. \n\n\nGood on you for sticking up for Cole. I know family is important but if your dad won't accept Cole for who they are, he's not worth talking to, period.", "NTA\n\nYou took on the role of a parent and parents have to protect their kids from time to time.

More families should teach the importance of respecting boundaries early on!", "So I'm guessing that while Cole identifies as a boy, genetically they are female? Because if Cole's cool with \"he\" why does your dad referring to them as \"he\" matter? That's a pretty big detail to live out if it's the case. \n\nNTA, I guess, but I don't know why we're expecting everyone to just indulge and immediately adapt to this stuff and getting so damn upset about it.

The respect and love you have for your step-son is goals. Hold your boundaries with your dad and Cole will be forever grateful!", "NTA\n\nAnd good job. I think you handled everything with exactly the right level of understanding and strength here.\n\nYou asked Cole what they felt comfortable with.

Seriously, they will never forget it!", "You're a great step-parent. Cole is lucky to have you.

Cole is going to find many people in their life that will act the way your dad did. What matters most is that he has parents willing to, not only be accepting, but, also, to stand up for them in difficult situations.

If he won't respect your stepson, or anyone's reasonable pronouns, then he's an asshole and not a good person. You said that he is not a bad person, just stubborn and conservative, but this is more than that. This is xenophobia, which an actual good person is not capable of to this degree. He disrespected your stepson and showed that his feelings and beliefs don't matter to him.

My mom tried to make it a joke and I just said \"we dont make those jokes, they are hurtful and mean. \" she threw a hissy fit but settled down when my daughter started getting upset and reverted back to supportive and loving grandma.

Well, actions have consequences.", "NTA\nFar far from being so, yes your dad my be conservative but that is different to being nasty and sorry but your dad was being nasty.\nIf your son sees himself as a he/they then that's his choice.

I can understand it as a phase as a choice. But to die on a hill that a 13 year old girl thinks that she is neither a girl nor a boy is just silly. You are only accepting while it is your belief, and everyone else is bigot.\nI'm happy I'm not from the US, fortunately around here it's not this bad that we are shaming family for having different opinions. Actually there is a saying in my country that \"she/he doesn't even know if she/he's a boy or a girl.\" We use it when someone being very confused and out of touch with reality. Quite funny how true it is these days. And again I will be very much dowvoted but this is Reddit anyway", "How is it 'hate' to believe in biological sex?

Are you saying that choosing your pronounce and demanding people to use them is not an ideology? \n\nNot at all, most people have pronouns they require other people to use they just more often line up with their assigned gender.
