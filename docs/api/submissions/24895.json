He should have chose a different property then. You shouldn\u2019t have to destroy your land or give some up because he doesn\u2019t want to cut some trees down on his.", "NTA. And if he does it anyway, he is laying the foundation for adverse possession to the land.  You need to be firm about this.", "Tell him to eat dirt, because legally he can't do squat, and is an asshole for wanting to basically take your land free of cost. Sucks to suck moment for real. Tell him that. NTA, he's a tool.", "NTA. Your land, and I wouldn't want to be involved in that situation. What if something happens on this road? Who's responsible for maintence? Just too many possible problems in the future, and like you said, what happens if he tries to claim it's his after so many years. \n\nI'd also think about possible solutions if there are any.", "NTA. If he has a way to straighten the road on his own land, he's got no business asking to use part of yours. There's lots of ways to make improvements to the existing road he has, he just wants the easier/cheaper way of asking you to give up part of your property for his benefit and will likely try to make you responsible for the upkeep of that part of his driveway since it sits on your land. It's not your responsibility to make accessing his home easier for him or his guests, especially if he's not landlocked from public roads, which it doesn't sound like he is.", "I'm struggling to see why you would even have to ask!", "NTA!! Don\u2019t let him do this!", "NTA - it\u2019s your property; you may do (or NOT do) with it as you please. he needs to invest his time and energy into repairing the existing road on HIS property than trying to cut through yours.", "NTA\n\nHe can make the current path better, or make a new one on his property.", "He could pave his road and then it would be an acceptable route in all weathers. NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is easy: Tell him NO.", "Let him build it with the condition he signs something that says you still own the land and he has to pay an exorbitant toll every time he uses it. Something like $100? One way.\n\nSeriously though, NTA. Dude's delusional", "Tell him to hire a guy with a tractor and grader and put gravel on his driveway.  Or pave it.  His bad driveway isn't your problem.", "NTA. He can use the old road or go along the property line. Where I live, if someone's land is landlocked without access to a road, their neighbor cannot block them from accessing their property. BUT the ONLY access they are legally required to give is along the property line. We can flat out legally refuse to allow a neighbor to cut across our property, but we can't block them from building a road along the property lines.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
