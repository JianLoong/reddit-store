You need to be firm about this.", "Tell him to eat dirt, because legally he can't do squat, and is an asshole for wanting to basically take your land free of cost. Sucks to suck moment for real. Tell him that. NTA, he's a tool.", "NTA. Your land, and I wouldn't want to be involved in that situation. What if something happens on this road? Who's responsible for maintence? Just too many possible problems in the future, and like you said, what happens if he tries to claim it's his after so many years. \n\nI'd also think about possible solutions if there are any.", "NTA. If he has a way to straighten the road on his own land, he's got no business asking to use part of yours. There's lots of ways to make improvements to the existing road he has, he just wants the easier/cheaper way of asking you to give up part of your property for his benefit and will likely try to make you responsible for the upkeep of that part of his driveway since it sits on your land. It's not your responsibility to make accessing his home easier for him or his guests, especially if he's not landlocked from public roads, which it doesn't sound like he is.", "I'm struggling to see why you would even have to ask!", "NTA!!

Where I live, if someone's land is landlocked without access to a road, their neighbor cannot block them from accessing their property.

He\u2019s overstepping as a neighbor in asking you to sacrifice the land you own for his benefit. Also legal issues could present in the future. \n\nOnly consider if there might be benefit for you, but I\u2019m team stream and wildflower field. Would be a shame to ruin it for a stupid road", "NTA.  Risking granting him squatters rights creates a legal hassle for you.  He has a way of fixing his road involving tree cutting.  Be smart and say No.", "NTA, although easements don't mean he will be able to claim your property. \n\nEven so, there's no way I would do it.", "NTA.  The liability alone would be a deal breaker!", "NTA- if he wants that land he needs to pay you for it\u2026 set an obscenely high price and when he doesn\u2019t buy it invest in some good fences and make sure you photograph the current condition of the land\u2026", "NTA.\n\nIt's your property, end of story.

He's not the only person ever to have  had a muddy road.  There are probably quite a few options other than using your land out of laziness.  Tell him to  do some research and mention things like harassment or suing if your property is infringed in any way.", "Exactly, I bought mine a handful of years before he bought his.  He just wants a simpler route.", "I'd suggest getting a camera to cover that area, from a distance, just in case he tries something.", "If OP doesn\u2019t want to allow it, he should just say no, not set conditions that he hopes the other party won\u2019t want to meet.

Obviously being sarcastic.", "NTA and it could be illegal to mess with the stream. I\u2019m thinking EPA but there are multiple government agencies that get involved with waterways and it can be a huge liability.", "NTA.  Post no trespassing signs and make sure your fence is up and that space not easily accessible.", "Nta. He can figure it out on his own land.", "NTA!!!  Make sure your property lines are clearly marked & let your neighbor know that you absolutely will not allow him to build a driveway across your land.  He can cut the trees in his land & plant new ones to replace them.", "You're definitely NTA (Not the Asshole) here. It's perfectly reasonable to prioritize your family's and your property's well-being. If your neighbor wants a road, he should be responsible for making it happen on his own property. Your concerns about the wildflower garden, the stream, and your kids' enjoyment are completely valid. It's his responsibility to manage his own land, and your decision to protect your property is totally justified.", "NTA. Particularly if he just asked if they ask if they could do so without mentioning an easement with some kind of compensation. Personally, I'd say no and offer to help chop up the lumber, with the knowledge that I'd probably never see them again.", "NTA. It's not your responsibility to solve your neighbor's access issues. As you write, if you give him an inch (literally) he may be able to claim it as his own in future.\n\nLeave him to figure out his own problem.", "Unfortunately you have to say no. You are right that this could have legal repercussions and result in a permanent situation. NAH.", "Nta", "Nta.\n\nYou could offer to sell him the land at 20 times to actual value.", "NTA.  Why would he even ask?? If he wants a road he can build it on his own land.  End of story.  Please stand firm on this.  This entire situation is ridiculous.  And to be safe, tell him IN WRITING and start a paper trail.", "NTA. He has a lot of nerve. He has 200 acres. He can figure something else out. \n\nSure, why should he cut down his own trees when he could steal a huge swathe of your land!\n\nYou are right, eventually he could lay claim to that land. In the meantime, he would be destroying the beauty of your property. \n\nNo, no, no, absolutely not!", "NTA.  It's too bad he needs to cut down trees to make his property access more accessible, but it is what it is!", "That, and a place for the water to go.", "Did you miss the next line where it's obviously a joke? Cause it's right there.", "\"seriously though\" implies the joke. Sorry that went over your head", "I know. That's what I was saying. I agreed you were not being serious in the least", "My bad", "If you are in the U S: Threaten to contact the Army Corps of Engineers and your Regional Water Quality Control Board. This sounds like something that would need a Section 404/401 permit under the Clean Water Act, and I bet he cannot afford that or the mitigation that may be required.   \n\n\nYes I know about the Sackett ruling but if this is a stream that eventually feeds into a real river it should still be protected. Right now we are all waiting for EPA guidance on Sackett and the CWA has been the law of the land for nearly 55 years.", "If you\u2019re only concern is him taking over the whole parcel you can protect yourself by allowing access with an easement agreement that is attached to the deed. The exact measurements of the easement are recorded and the agreement should specify that he is responsible for maintenance and upkeep of the road. It\u2019s commonly referred to as a right of way easement", "NTA why would you risk devaluing or possibly losing a portion of your property to save trees on your neighbor\u2019s property?", "Soooo because he doesn\u2019t want to destroy part of his property (trees), he thinks he should have a right to destroy part of yours?! I would tell him absolutely not! If he gets confrontational or aggressive about it, put up a camera facing that area and no trespassing signs. If you give in to this you are setting yourself up for him taking part of your land through adverse possession. NTA", "NTA. He can spend his money and use his own land to improve his driveway access.", "NTA. Your property, your rules. He decided to pick land that is hard to access. Not your problem", "NTA. He has the option to cut down his own trees, there\u2019s zero reason for him to use your property for this purpose.", "Get a lawyer", "NTA. Quite the intro.", "Or tell him yes... for $10,000,000 (or some other ridiculously high number you would actually accept if he paid it).", "NTA Usually people pay for easements and resumptions. Even the government pays you if they want to put a road on your land. Why on Earth would your neighbour think that they would be entitled to this land for free? Even if they were paying, why on Earth would you sell unless it were significantly worth your while?\n\nIf you think that your neighbour will play dirty, Yellowstone rancher style\u2026 slap on a conservation protection order to your land for the butterflies. If you are lucky, the government might even pay you to keep the land as wild flowers.", "NTA your land your choice!", "NTA\n\nHe knew the boundaries of the property when he bought it. Any land outside of those boundaries is owned by someone else and he shouldn't be setting foot on it.\n\nAnd far from needing your land, he does have options - regrading and rebuilding the current road to put in better drainage, and cutting down a few trees to create a better route on his own land to start with.\n\nAnd why should you be expected to pay for your land, then hand it over to someone else? Remembering that factors like 'slightly awkward drive' were all factored into the selling price of his property - why should you pay for his laziness?\n\nThe only offer I would consider entertaining would be to sell (or trade) him land outright. That would at least give you a return for the inconvenience, and putting it into his name would absolve you of any future issues in terms of claiming the land through adverse possession or right of access, or legal issues should there be a crash or damage.", "Flowergarden or not, it's your's.\nIf one's property doesn't give the access, then it's on them to make it.

The road will ruin your property and not be used by you, instead being an inconvenience. Also if your daughter's are playing near the road and he or a visitor.of his comes barrelling through one day...\n\nIf he does have to cut down some trees Though you could offer to buy the wood or help him remove the stumps or if you WOULD use the road offer to help him pay towards it but his inconvenience with something on his property doesn't mean he gets to demand to cut through yours.\n\nIt's definitely time to get cameras up and around your property. Especially around the butterfly garden and stream area", "Say no, and if necessary fence the land. This kind of thing can turn pretty vicious, so I'd be polite and clear from the get-go, and show him that you are keeping a careful eye on that part of your land.", "Not only free of cost, but having a neighbors road across the property probably lowers the value of OPs property, due to less useable land, lower beauty value, more sound pollution etc. Neighbor has alternatives (cut down his own trees and fix his own road) and OP doesn\u2019t have to be involved at all in the solution.

The store in one town, but the roads to get to it--which were too small for a big store--and the drainage for the store in another one. The town with the roads said no, the other said yes. So Walmart just started knocking down trees and clearing the land and built the store, while leaving a small number of trees to screen what they were doing. Guess they figured it was easier to sue for the road access once the store was there. And it was! Fucking store is still there.", "A trail cam, maybe? The kind people use to watch wild animals. They're already weatherproof. You could add a couple to the field, and your kids can watch the butterflies and such from the house as a bonus.", "In the long run he will end up with a legal right to use whatever you were to give him with no recourse on your part so no way would I allow it if I were in your shoes. And to destroy a beloved garden that you likely worked hard to install so this guy won\u2019t be inconvenienced\u2026hell naw. He should be ashamed for even asking to just \u201cgive it to him\u201d.", "Hahaha! yeah no. NTA.

Noone is entitled to your land", "NTA. Don\u2019t let him put a road through your property in later he could claim it as his using eminent domain. And I would treasure that butterfly garden.

It's his problem, not yours.  If he wants to make it your problem, it's up to him to make you an offer worth your inconvenience.
