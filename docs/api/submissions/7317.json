I bet your great grandmother left it to you because you weren't part of the arguments in front of her and because you had left the country so it would be harder for your relatives to come after you.   \nYou are under no obligation to sell that ring, and quite frankly, it probably would not sell enough to cover the medical expenses. Unfortunately, resell prices are not usually close to purchase or insurance value. If you have some extra money and feel generous, you could chip in what you can afford. Just know that your relationship with these relatives will be permanently damaged, but it sounds like that this won't be a loss for you.", "NTA. There are plenty of other ways to raise money. If they can band together to bitch , they can band together to brain storm a better idea to save the life they're so concerned about", "NTA and it's unlikely the ring would manage to cover all the medical treatment expenses anyways if you live in the US just because medical treatment is SO expensive.\n\nDo they already know what it was appraised for? If not, I would just lie and tell them a professional appraiser said it wasn't worth as much as thought. Or \u2014 honestly you don't have to defend yourself to these people. They sound awful and cruel.", "NTA\n\nThey want you to sell the ring because, \"If neither of us can have it, no one else can.\"\n\nUnless this ring is made of pure solid gold, I doubt it will even cover the medical expenses. \nKeep the ring. I doubt any of them would have sold it to pay for said family member's medical bills", "Why Grandma left the ring to you is obvious: everyone else cared more about getting the ring than about grandma. Also, they never treated you right, so why do they expect you to fork out money now? NTA.\n\nInfo: the person who is actually ill, was he/she nice to you or rude?", "NTA.  It would be very interesting to see what one of the other family members would do if they had the ring ... would they sell it?  Easy to say \"sell it\" when it doesn't impact them.\n\nWhy don't they all contribute some cash for this person instead?", "NTA - It sounds like your relatives don't treat you like family, but a cash cow. The ring was left to YOU for a reason - possibly as her last word about their behavior.\n\nThis is the age if GoFundMe. They have an alternative. Let them use it.", "I N F O: If you did sell the ring, would that even begin to cover the cost of your relative's medical bills, realistically? If the ring had gone to someone else in your family, would they still be pushing for the ring to be sold?\n\nEdit: I see that the cost of the procedure would be around $27,000. Your family has a lot of high, unrealistic hopes for that ring. Even if it's actually worth that much money, it's not necessarily going to be a breeze finding a buyer for it. If an entire family can't come up with $27,000, what makes them think someone has that much money just lying around burning a hole in their pocket? And further, what makes them think that very wealthy individual will be right there to scoop up that ring as soon as you list it for sale?\n\nThe pressure your family is putting on you honestly feels a bit spiteful to me. The black sheep of the family inherited the most coveted item, and now they're insisting you must part with it. So, tell me, what items are your relatives selling of their own in order to raise this money? Who else is contributing to this expense? Why does it fall solely on you?\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  The people demanding that you pay for her expenses should be doing that themselves, and I might ask them if they've sold their cars, mortgaged their homes, or dipped into their savings or retirement accounts to pay for her treatment.  I might also point out that they're the ones who didn't treat you like family or even with basic human decency and only now expect you to do the opposite.  Um, no.", "NTA. However you might want to get the ring appraised to sell (as opposed to for insurance) for your own benefit.\n\nFor many families, the heirloom in question might be worth $900 or something.\n\nCertainly high sentimental value but rarely incredible actual monetary value. The resale value on diamonds is usually surprisingly low.", "NTA. They say you\u2019re not \u201cpart of the family\u201d yet expect you to take on the family\u2019s financial burdens. Why isn\u2019t everyone else in the extended family contributing towards this person\u2019s medical care or starting a go fund me or working to get her on their insurance?

If they can't have that stupid ring no one.  They are fixated on this thing.  I'd get it praised by a professional jewerly shop.  Unless it's sometype of antique usually rings go down in value not save value or increase value.  They could all be fighting over absolutley nothing.", "NTA\n\nWould they have done the same thing? Is that why they were fighting for it?\n\nPlus, even if it is valued at a lot, that doesn\u2019t mean you have a buyer ready to pay said price.", "NTA. It isn't your responsibility to take care of people who are essentially strangers. Especially by selling YOUR property. And i'm going to go on a limb and say that the money from the sale of the ring wont be significant enough to cover any sort of life saving treatment, which often goes into the hundreds of thousands.", "NTA.\n\nYour great great grandmother gave you the ring, specifically.  It is yours to do with as you will.\n\nThat said, if you can afford in any way to assist your family member that has a serious illness, please do so as you are able, and feel free to tell your nosey family that you are doing that.", "NTA\n\nWhy even bother with those people who don't even consider you family. Yet another reason why the US needs universal health care, assuming that's where you and and your family are from. \n\nBut you are NTA. From what I gather you rarely see or speak to these people and they don't even like you and yet they have the gaul to demand YOUR ring? Who do they think they are? Sauron?!\n\nTo hell with them.", "NTA. Family heirlooms like that do have a general price in society (obviously because someone would always buy it), but are priceless in the grand scheme of things for your family. I\u2019m sure the future generations of your family will appreciate that you held your ground and did not sell it. \n\nAlso, your other family member\u2019s health is not your or your great great grandmother\u2019s direct responsibility. If they need money that badly, they can start a fundraiser - to me it seems like they just want to control what happens to the ring and are using the sick family member as an excuse. \n\nAnyways, none of this matters because it is your ring now and you can do whatever you fit!", "NTA The ring was left to you. It's not up to anyone else in the family to tell you what to do with it.", "NTA  Your family is angry that you inherited the ring and so their response is to guilt trip you into selling a family heirloom and giving them the money, that will not be anywhere near enough to pay for catastrophic medical expenses, just so that you don't get to keep great grandma's ring.  They are so petty.", "INFO: Will it really cover the expenses? Did anyone give money to the person with the illness?\n\n  \nNTA, it looks like they're solely depending on that ring to cover the expenses. I think they should just gang up and raise the money instead of saying bad things about you. So, keep that ring with you.", "NTA If they need the money they will have plenty of other ways of doing so.", "NTA. Your grandma knew the family were fighting over it\u2026they did it front of her.    She likely knew they were only interested in it\u2019s possible intrinsic value.  She gave it to you pointedly and purposefully, quite possibly because she knew you WOULDN\u2019T sell it.   \n\nShe must have known of this relative\u2019s illness right? She could have left it to them, or sold it in her lifetime for any reason, and given them or anyone money from it.\n\nShe wants the ring to remain in the family, and entrusted it with you.", "NTA. This family speaks horribly about you and to you and they still are even when asking for a huge gift. I wonder how it would have gone had the started with I\u2019m so sorry.  No need to answer because it\u2019s irrelevant.", "NTA \n\nIt is your ring to do with as you please. \n\nThey mistreat you, yet expect you to use your inheritance to give them money? It will not be a loan. You will be wasting your inheritance on people who despise you. They can set up payment plan, or fundraisers to pay for treatment.\n\nThere is a compromise though. You will sell the ring after they have sold all their gaming systems, their cars, their homes, all toys, get rid of streaming services, and sell all but 7 days worth of clothes. Essentially they have to get rid of their possessions first.", "NTA, First of all there is no guarantee selling the ring would raise enough to pay for treatment. Also, how much effort has gone into other methods of raising money? How likely is treatment to succeed?  There a wide difference between \"easy source of cash\" and \"last resort\"\n\nSecond, it has been made clear to you that you aren't family, why should you give up heirlooms to help them? It's quite hypocritical to simulation judge you for taking things you don't deserve because your not family while expecting you to act like you are\n\nThird, calling you a murderer is utterly ridiculous. You are neither the cause for her condition, nor is her care and recovery your responsibility. While helping would be the kind thing to do, you bear no moral burden if you choose not to do so", "NTA\n\nAnd with the medical costs the way it is, unless that ring is incredibly huge, I don\u2019t know of any ring that would possibly cover a medical bill that high. Clearly they exist, but most rings handed down aren\u2019t worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.", "NTA what they probably don't realize is grandma left the ring to you because everyone else was fighting over it like a bunch of crazy people.  Grandma saw that and thought screw it. None of these greedy ingrates will get it and it went to you.\n\nThis isn't remotely about medical bills, this is a guilt trip and power play over the ring.  You have no legal or even moral obligation to help these people.  They may be *family* but in reality rhy are practically strangers and strangers who are treating you like crap and behaving quite badly.  Keep the ring, Blick everyone who is being an ass, and live your life", "NTA, calling you a murderer is fucked, these seem like horrible people and ggma gave you the ring for this reason", "No. If they\u2019re so close they can sell their assets to heal her. Why should you sell what\u2019s yours? Jewelry that\u2019s second hand is rarely highly valuable anyway. Be glad you\u2019re not close to these people and I\u2019d it comes up again tell them to sell their car/house whatever.", "Nta. Like they have no money? Let me pool all their money and pay for it.

Therefore, you are under no obligation to help out.", "NTA\n\nThey said you are not really family, so how does being family suddenly matter?\n\nSeems like your gggMother knew exactly what she did, when she didn't feed the ring to the sharks.", "INFO: is the engagement ring your Great Great Grandma left you the ONLY heirloom in the family? Seriously, is that the only thing they could think of selling? Is the ring also more valuable than anything else?", "She left it to you for a reason, and the rest seem to treat you like shit.

They can go ask some other virtual stranger for money, or better yet, people who actually care about them.\n\nKeep the ring. Cherish that you got it, because you're great-great-grandmother saw you as family, and probably appreciated that you weren't stabbing your family members in the back to get it.

I mean from the story I think we know why the ring was left to you and not them. Are you 100% sure she needs the treatment and it\u2019s not all a ruse to get the ring from you? Because by the sounds of these people aren\u2019t below doing that. If I was you, I\u2019d cut contact with everyone of them. If she truly needs life saving treatment, let the rest of them pool their resources and sell things to raise the money, this isn\u2019t on you", "NTA - Don\u2019t you dare sell it. They have made it clear how they feel about you and ONLY are asking you because they know you got the shiny prize they wanted and fought over.  I would put money on it that you got the ring because you weren\u2019t arguing over it and asking for it. Let me be clear: if you didn\u2019t get this ring, no one in the \u201cfamily\u201d would be bugging you for any money at all. They are only asking you because they know you have it and don\u2019t think it should have been yours. \nHowever: \u201cNot really part of the family\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t family in the sense that it was left to you as a family member. Family doesn\u2019t just mean those who live close. Families move, immigrate, take jobs in other cities or live close to their significant other\u2019s family. Sometimes those people don\u2019t actually act like family. Your blood makes you family and that\u2019s why you got the ring from someone who wanted to make sure you were included and seen as family in their eyes. Don\u2019t negate that sentiment.

Hope this helps.", "NTA - also it\u2019s unlikely you would get more than $200 for a used ring no matter how \u201cexpensive\u201d it is. My sister was a jeweler for 20 years and she worked with the only goldsmith in our town who would frequently buy jewelry from people. They didnt purchase jewelry for high dollar value. Even most pawn shops will only pay less than half the value. These people are delusional if they think that selling the ring will solve anything. It wouldn\u2019t. Enjoy the ring.

I suspect your ggm knew exactly what she was doing when she left the ring to you.

A Modern Jeweler would shave it down, add forty or fifty more cuts (no, really) and it would sparking like the Beacons summoning aid to Gondor, but it'd also be much smaller (and the pieces would be repurposed into flashing and chips for a new setting).\n\nIf you want a ball park figure, just look up the different stones like it online and figure you'd be selling it for half that, maximum.
