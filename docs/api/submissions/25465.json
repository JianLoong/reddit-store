My GF is mad that I was \u201cstalking\u201d her location after I caught her in another lie.", "selftext": "My (35m) GF (28F) and I have been together almost 2 years, living together for over 1 year. \n\nOver the past 2 years she has lied to me AT LEAST 3 times. The first 2 times, she confessed weeks after lying to me \u201cwhat really happened\u201d. Both times, she lied because If she had told me what had really happened, she was worried that I would think she was cheating on me. Won\u2019t go into more details than that. \n\nLast night I caught her in the 3rd lie. \n\nI\u2019m out of town at my parents place dealing with a parent who is in all likelihood dying. My GF has had a rough week and planned a big night out with some of her girlfriends, all of whom are single. She promised to \u201cwing-woman\u201d for one in particular. \nThey go to one bar, and then another new night club that recently opened in our town. We touch base a few times throughout the night. Everything seems fine. \n\nNow it\u2019s 2:20am, parent has had a rough night (hence why I\u2019m still up), and I call GF to distract myself. She and her friend are clearly pretty drunk (as they should be) and having a great time. It is noticeably quieter than a nightclub in the background and I ask where she is. There\u2019s an awkward pause and some hushed whispers in the background. She then tells me she still at a bar just briefly using the bathroom, then in a weird tone says she has to go\u2026\n\nI used to be bartender in this state and they have pretty hard and specific rules about being open after 2am. \n\nMy bullshit meter is pinging in the back of my head and I pull up google maps to see where she actually is (we both share our location with each other 24/7 and have done so for over a year). \n\nTurns out she and her friend went back to a random apartment with a bunch of guys (and other girls) to party more. \n\nI\u2019m pretty hurt at this point. I have never lied to her once and have regularly asked her to tell me the truth in all scenarios, even when she thinks it\u2019ll make me mad/upset. I contemplated just waiting for the morning and immediately breaking up with her, but for some reason decided to call her out in the moment, sent her a screenshot of her location and FaceTimed her. \n\nBy this point she has excused herself to the apartment balcony and tries to continue the lie. I stop her and beg her to just tell me what\u2019s going on. Then she comes clean and says her friend met this guy at the club and wanted to go back with him but since her friend was fucked up, she didn\u2019t want her to go to the guys place alone, and her friend told her to lie to me about where they were/what they were doing because it would seem like she was cheating. Obviously I\u2019m not thrilled about all this, tell her I believe her but I wish that she had just told me that from the start, we say good night. \n\nNeedless to say, I didn\u2019t sleep all night. \nI then get a text at 5:50 am stating that she\u2019s back home now and is upset that I was \u201cstalking her location when she was trying to look after her friend\u201d. \n\nI really do love this girl, but with all the lying, I don\u2019t know if I can trust her.", "created_utc": 1692966775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160xzrj/aitah_my_gf_is_mad_that_i_was_stalking_her/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Once stating she was at the bar still then when u called her out on the silence she lied and said it was because she was in the restroom. Then lied and said she had to get off the phone.  Then when u called her out continued lying on the balcony. It's honestly disgusting. It sounds like you're dealing with a child. And some people (esp ppl doing the wrong) refuse to understand cheating doesn't have to take place for betrayal to occur. She is betraying you all the way around. An entire group of her friends knew she was lying to u aswell which makes matters even worse. She needs a serious come to Jesus meeting and it's even more heartbreaking all this is happening when youre tending to your sick loved ones. The narcissistic traits are all over the meter w this girl.  Even if u dont want to u need to leave her or u are in for a long road of heartache.

I wouldn't want to live in a relationship like that. I would also, personally, be wondering now if she was cheating or not. Maybe not full on sleeping with one of the guys, but, again, why lie? Were you being flirty and dancing with these guys in a pretty sexual way? Would your behaviour be such that, if I saw it, I'd be upset about it?

I helped him out and it took longer than I would have liked, so I was late getting home that night.
