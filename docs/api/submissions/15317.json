Your parents have made a brat. One of these days she will act this way to the wrong person and get in trouble. They have done her no favors allowing her to treat people that way.", "NTA\nOP, does your little sister act like a brat with her friends? Do you think socialization will rectify the bratiness?", "NTA show your parents this post, and the comments.\n\nAt 12 it\u2019s almost too late. She might be ruined for a majority of her adult years, until her situation becomes so desperate that she changes her mindset out of sheer desperation because her life is in ruins. But that might be when she is 45.\n\nTomorrow...hell today, they need sit her down and explain that now that she is almost a teenager, everyone is going to help her become the most successful and happy teenager with goals and a bright future. But in order for her to reach her next level in growing up, there will be a few changes to help her grow.\n\nShe should not be called baby anymore. She has a name. Use it.\n\nScreaming can\u2019t be her mode of communication. Anytime she begins screaming, NOBODY can understand what she is saying. Zero comprehension of the words. Nothing. \u201cSorry darling, I can\u2019t understand what you are saying, please remain calm and use your normal voice so I can help you\u201d\n\nNever answer her screams. \n\nOffer her new opportunities for success. A new hobby, something she is good at, offer praise for those new events, or her actions. Lavish praise for her new behaviors, and when she reverts back to her baby ways, either you can\u2019t understand what she is saying. Or your parents gently redirect her to her new goals or something positive.\n\nIf your parents refuse to put in the work now to change her bad behavior, the world will step in. And the world is a cruel teacher. Your sister will have a miserable life because the universe works very slowly on teaching lessons. Years and very bad things will happen to her. \n\nYour sister needs an immediate new life plan. And pray it\u2019s not too late.", "NTA and your mom isnt doing her any favours either. She's old enough to speak respectfully.", "NTA. She needs to learn self control", "NTA. Your parents are doing your younger sister a huge disservice. She is gonna find it hard to maintain relationships and jobs. Shame on them. Get out as soon as you can and keep setting boundaries. You are NOT making it worse. That\u2019s what a child phycologist would say to do. Acknowledge you understand she\u2019s upset but you won\u2019t engage until she calms down.", "NTA. I sincerely hope baby sis recognizes her terrible behavior and changes it. Because unless you are cussing her out or putting hands on her, the behavior makes no sense.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are the AHs. To your sister more than anyone else - she\u2019s not going to enjoy having to unlearn these behaviours later in life when no-one else will enable them.", "NTA. \n\nThat would suck. You might want to look at \"Love and Logic\" one liners to see if some of those might be helpful for side stepping the arguments. Things like, \"We can talk about this when you're using your regular voice and not yelling at me.\" Or, \"I wish I could let you borrow my charger but my last charger disappeared \\[she stole it, broke it, lost it\\]. I need this one for school so I have to make sure this one doesn't get lost.\"", "Nta. Don't tell her to stop. Laugh at her, roll your eyes, and walk away.", "NTA. You are allowed to react. Not reacting will make her believe it is okay. \n\nHowever, her age may play a factor in her behavior. From about the age of 12 to 15, teens are just raging, uncontrolled, hormone-filled emotions.  They are mean and dramatic, especially to family. I dont know why, but teen girls are especially scary.  Me and my cousins each ruined a vacation each as we each turned 13. Two of my nieces terrorized the family for a couple years each and the youngest one is in doing it now. \n\nThey are going through a lot of changes at that time, their body, their mind, their feelings everything is new. I am not saying that she should be allowed ro get away with it, but try to remember yourself at that age and remind yourself it will pass. They (usually) get better, just try to be patient and empathetic.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
