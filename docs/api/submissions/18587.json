So he has the agency to choose who and where he spends his time as a young adult.\n\nIt might be good for him to spend time with his mom and realize that having 0 structure means he either falls further into his self-made messes, or he can work on figuring out his life. Lastly and this is a lot of outloud thinking from me... but he's also making messes and escaping to her house already when being asked to do basic stuff like keeping his space clean. It's not unfair to ask him to choose a permanent spot if he's barely managing in your space which he's already only there part time.", "INFO. I feel like we don\u2019t have enough info to really say. I have a lot of questions. \nHow is he a failure to launch at 18? He\u2019s not 25\u2026he hasn\u2019t even had a chance. He\u2019s still in school even.\nHave you asked him why he\u2019s upset? Have you spend time with him? Has he seen a therapist?\n\nCan he come visit you? Or are you just going to let him figure it out over there?", "INFO I'm confused. How old is your stepson now?\n\nCuz your talking about failure to launch like he's in his late 20s or 30s or older. But at the same time saying that he has to pick a single home to live in when he turns 18.\n\nSo yeah a teenager can fail to launch. They're teenagers. They can make terrible decisions.\n\nBut they can't fail to launch. They haven't had been launched yet.", "INFO:\nWhat does visiting look like now? \nHe can still come over for a family dinner if he wants to but you\u2019re just not going through the custody style back-and-forth sleeping arrangements? He\u2019s not allowed at all?", "Info: When did his parents separate and when did you and his dad get together?", "INFO: Can he still visit you? Is there a planned schedule on how he spends time with your family?", "Failure to launch is about middle age living at home with parents. Not almost 18. \n\nInfo: Do you honestly believe that things will be better for him, in the way that you want it to, while staying at the other house with no rules?", "YTA. Sounds like you abandoned a child and a lot of people are patting you on the back. Are there terrible parent awards?", "In my opinion YTA..This sounds so cold and cruel to me.", "I don't want to call you an AH, but it sounds like you're really doing this more for your sanity and peace.  I don't see how it really helps him.  This isn't even a situation where you're making him pay rent or something so that he's forced to get a job; you're basically just washing your hands of him.  Unfortunately I guess I have to say YTA.", "NTA AT ALL!!! The constant back and forth is disruptive to you and your husband and gives your stepson the ability to skirt responsibility at either home. You did the right thing OP, stick to your guns.", "ESH \"failure to launch\" and he's just turned 18?  I totally understand how frustrating parenting a teen can be but you're basically made a plan to kick him out before he's even old enough to be on his own or make a choice on his next steps (college, work, trade school etc.)", "Honestly, he kinda sounds depressed. Also, what language do you use to describe him, to him? If you say to his face that he\u2019s shown \u201cfailure to launch\u201d that light be messing things up. Was the divorce or separation recent (like, just before the pandemic started?) ? Does he have learning disabilities or other mental illnesses? Have you gotten him evaluated for such?", "YTA - All of these \u201cproblems\u201d you stated are classic signs of mental health issues. Please get your son to a therapist and psychiatrist.", "I wonder what might have happened in the past 4 years that would cause a high school student to struggle academically and emotionally. Huh. I just can\u2019t put my finger on it but I feel like there was something, right?\n\nI am so sick of posts from parents complaining about grades at this point. We all went through a major upheaval in 2020 and it is well-documented that it particularly screwed things up for kids in school. Not everyone can just bounce back from distance learning and social isolation. ESPECIALLY when it happened just as he was starting high school.\n\nAn entire generation of kids had their lives irreparably altered by the pandemic. We can\u2019t undo that. All we can do is try to be understanding.\n\nEdit: YTA", "Failure to launch before 18 = failure by parents. It's on you if your kid isn't ready to fly at 18, but no matter what, you gave failed you child for him to have these emotional immaturity issues. YDTA", "YTA. \n\nA child should always be welcome home. Even if he isn\u2019t what you want/expect him to be, you can\u2019t just throw him away. Especially at 18. He\u2019s still young and learning", "YTA you should always have a welcoming home for your child, you never know when they might need it. he\u2019s 18 and will grow out of it.", "YTA\n\nHe's 18 and you already consider him a failure to launch? That's a failure to parent. I imagine it is really challenging but you've essentially kicked him out and that's a really crappy thing to do to your teenage kid unless they are violent or endangering the family.", "NTA.  But don't be surprised when his Mom gets tired of being used.  You better be willing to walk the walk.", "YTA are you the driving force behind this? Where is the dad? Forcing him to choose where to live permanently just makes him not your problem anymore. Have you gotten him therapy? \n\nI don\u2019t understand how it helps him to make it so he can\u2019t live at both parents house? It sounds like you gave him the ultimatum knowing he would choose his mom so he would leave.", "NTA taking into account this was his dad's idea. The kid has the freedom to choose. If he's not 18 yet, I would have a family discussion letting him know he can change his mind before he's 18 or after a few months (specify an exact time) of staying in one place.\n\nUsually with shared custody time, escaping parenting to the other parent's house shouldn't be allowed. Usually the time each parent gets is specified in the custody agreement and the child cannot randomly go to the other during one parent's time. If you would like to put a stop to that, his mum needs to be involved in the discussion.", "How can he be a failure to launch kid for the last several years if he just turned 18?  \n\nYTA.  And so is his dad.  This plan is so transparent.", "After reading your comments -> 100 % NTA", "NTA", "YTA", "Perhaps say that once he hits 18 the expectations will be higher and if he fails to meet them (keeping the place clean, being polite, etc) that at that point he had to live with his mom?", "He absolutely needs to choose where he stays.

Nta", "yta. how is having him pick between two parents going to help him be more responsible??", "YTA doesn't sound like you tried to get to the bottom of his issues.Was he just terrible at school not everybody is good at school,did he mental illnesses.Not having motivation for example is a symptom of depression.", "YTA - you should have kept basic rules. Make him do household chores. Find an appropriate punishment (no electronic until room is clean, etc). But not kick them out.", "Why does he live with you now if he doesn\u2019t want to?", "Esh, I don't think that you are your spouse are the ahs, but I do think that your stepson thinks you are. Just make sure to try to stay apart of his life in every way possible as long as he allows, or else he might feel like y'all kicked him out and made him fend for himself at such a young age blah blah blah", "Have you tried listening? Have a good ol' heart to heart? If this is new behavior, something that is difficult may have triggered it. NTA", "18 is more than old enough to pick a home and live in it, doesn't mean stopping weekend visits or stay overs just means he has a base. You need a base as an adult where all your mail comes to and where you reside for any other adult stuff. It's not like you said all right 18 now fuck off to your mums, you gave him a choice. NtA he wants to be difficult thats on him.", "NTA\n\nYou're not leaving the kid out to dry, he will have a safety net and support from you guys, he will be fine and hopefully figure his shit out.\n\nIf not, you've done what you can, people need to be responsible for themselves at some point... And if Mum chooses to not implement rules, then she can lie in that bed.\n\nYou're doing the right thing, keep in contact and give advice, but hold strong.", "NTA as he is fully aware of his actions, what was required of him in your household, and the impact/ consequences. At 18 you do not have to provide for him so you gave him options. Best he goes and learns the hard way as an adult.", "Who does his parent , your spouse say?  are they on board with this treatment of their kid?\n\nIf so, then NTA\n\nIf not,  you have a problem with communication.", "NTA he'll be back once he realizes he needs the structure", "NTA and welcome to the hard side of \"Tough Love\".  By allowing him to bounce back and forth between houses you actually enabled him.  He got mad at you and went there.  When he got mad there he came to you.  He no longer has that option and is mad at you for it.  I got raked over the coals (-57) a short while ago for using the \"Failure to Launch\" example.\n\nWith the volunteering I do I constantly have to remind myself \"I am not walking away because I don't care but because they don't\".  Granted I am still around and will be there to help them pick-up the pieces when they crash and burn.  It's not easy watching it but you as a giver have to set limits because takers do not have any.\n\nOnce again NTA!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
