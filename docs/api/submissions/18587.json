He chose his mom\u2019s house which we figured he would because she has more space, no rules and he\u2019s mad at us for having him do this. My question is AITA for making him chose a house?

I wasn't the best student at the time (a lot of my siblings also had issues in public education, mine were just less obvious) - so this ultimatum was not unexpected. Being fresh out of high school, I had precisely zero interest in college (I skipped the ACT/SAT tests that my school tried to mandate) or working.

Sometimes going from house to house makes you feel like you\u2019re never 100% in either family and your ground is always shakey. Im assuming this kid went years being forced to swap from house to house by a custody agreement made by adults.

And most people aren\u2019t prepared to be financially independent at 18 because of how expensive housing is relative to wages.\n\nIf someone was in their 20\u2019s and showing no motivation to move out and be independent, THAT is a failure to launch. So I think you have some unfair expectations here.\n\nThere is however a problem that he goes to the other parent\u2019s house to escape reasonable responsibilities and continue to treat everyone in the home badly. Based on that, expecting him to choose a house imo is warranted.\n\nYou\u2019re not kicking him out in the traditional sense, as living with you permanently was an option - but he won\u2019t get to play half a foot in, half a foot out anymore.\n\nNot living with you permanently doesn\u2019t mean cut off, either. \n\nHopefully he figures his shit out in the next few years, and realizes you were being responsible parents.", "Info: has he ever spoken to a therapist?

You know other teens who are getting all As, working a job, staring a nonprofit and competing at state.  While your kid is fine you definitely worry because when you were there age you had a lot more responsibility and way fewer resources.  So you start to think that the teen isn't going to get their act together any time soon.  While technically they may not have launched yet you can see they are not on the right path either.  Splitting hairs isn't helpful when the teen is 17.", "For real thought though: what's the solution? There are zero re-dos and you can't turn back time. You have to pick up the pieces and move on at some point.  And sometimes parents have to force it, otherwise you're enabling a toxic to themselves behavior.", "They have been understanding.  It does him no good for them to just suffer his mess making, rudeness, and apparently fighting with his brother.  Trying to teach him how to get along with other humans IS the right response here.", "And yet, at 18 they can't force him to face responsibility and do the work to move his life forward. Especially if he just runs away to mom's house whenever he doesn't feel like taking care of his shit. \n\nAll they can do is set clear boundaries and give options, which they have. And the constant running away from responsibility is such a reasonable place to put a boundary. It's a deal-breaker issue. If kiddo didn't have the option to run away, they could have pushed the issue more in the last couple years. And they'd maybe have gotten through to him. Or they wouldn't have and he'd leave after his bday and had to figure his own shit out then. Or get kicked out after so long with zero forward effort. \n\nSpeaking as a parent in a blended family, with a teenager who has been struggling as you've described-- there's only so much power a parent has, both after 18 *and* in a coparenting family. I think all of us wish to some extent that we could rewind our kids to fix the last 3 years, but we can't. \n\nThey're not leaving their son destitute and resourceless. They have laid out reasonable expectations and options. They have maintained to the son that they are there for him in all ways except shirking responsibility and being an inconsiderate house mate, which are acceptable boundaries to have with an adult child. \n\nIt's not ideal, but things rarely are. How long do they have to be at the mercy of this kid's fickle relationship with growing up? How should they enforce the help he needs if he's allowed to constantly bail when things get difficult? They didn't kick him out, he made a choice after understanding a boundary.", "Please reread.  OP said a few times he'll always be welcome at their home.", "My dad made my brother make the same choice, and he chose his mom's, and honestly, he blossomed. He's in a great university now and shares nothing but kindness and love. \n\nThe age your stepson is at is a difficult one developmentally, and there's a chance that when he reaches a place where he feels he has more stability on his own (without the back and forth) he may have the same blossom as my brother, but everyone is different and since I don't know your stepson, I can only speculate based on my own experiences. But I'm hoping for the sake of everyone involved that is what happens. \n\nDo keep in mind that adolescence is hard, and I think you made the right call in having him choose a place to try to gain traction for stability in his own mind.", "I wouldn\u2019t have made him \u201cchoose\u201d but it probably would have made more sense to just say \u201chey, there are the rules if you want to live here, that are in place not just for us but also your future development. We aren\u2019t asking much just respect, clean up after yourself, xyz.  We love you and want you to stay but if you feel you can\u2019t live with these house rules you can go live with your mom because your happiness is important to us\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what we said to our son after enduring verbal abuse and the same threats to go to the other parent\u2019s home (also no structure, no rules) and we were tired of it.

Either college or supporting (just personal expenses not rent) themselves makes them more appreciative of what they had and how much you are doing for them.

Or perhaps you have a different idea of what launched is than me and the rest of these \u201closers\u201d? Either way, they need you just as much as you need them. Good luck with that\u263a\ufe0f", "Just because he\u2019s not on the street doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not kicked out of OP\u2019s home.", "That doesn't even make sense. He has a home at both parents house. He's just not swapping back and forth anymore. Arguably it's better for his mental health because juggling two homes is stressful.", "I\u2019m not sure why OP is posting then, if this is such a minor non-event.", "Because they're unsure...?", "YATA. You wanted him out of your house, so you arranged for him to choose between his mom and you - so basically he chose his mom which you were counting on all along. \n\nI hope you like looking after your husband alone when he's really old - because his kid will hate him.\n\nWhy not let him stay closest to the job he can find? Or closest to his college? Nope. It's about you and not him.", "You \"tried everything\" hey?\n\nHave you tried therapy? Counseling?\n\nIf a kid is showing signs of disinterest in his life, poor grades, and low motivation, investing some effort into his mental health might be more productive than 'tough love.\"\n\nDivorce is very, very traumatic for kids. If he still has unresolved resentments from his parents splitting, that can cause all those things you mentioned.\n\nIf I were you I would welcome him back, if he agreed to see a therapist and/or life coach(?) or *someone* who might be able to help him figure out what he wants his \"launch\" to look like.", "I think YNTA. Right now it seems like he goes to one house makes messes, becomes combative then runs away to the other home. Then rinse repeat. That\u2019s not healthy. It\u2019s good that you gave him a choice. \nNow just continue inviting him to family days (Sunday dinners or whatever your version is).", "NTA. You set clear boundaries and rules and gave him options to live somewhere else too. You didn't abandon him. He's not homeless and you didnt cut him off or out of your life. \n\nYes 18 is young but not too young to realize when you live with other ppl there are rules. Cleaning up after yourself and not being a jerk to others is usually pretty common when living with non family members", "I mean \u201cfailure to launch\u201d is probably not the right term, because it implies that the launch is basically living and surviving on your own\u2026 and 18 is a bit young for that.\n\nBut I think what OP is talking about here is \u201cfailure to keep up\u201d, which is fair. At 18, one should be able to manage chores and treat family members with basic respect\u2026 some might argue that 18 year olds should be working as well and taking on a bunch of other responsibilities.\n\nI think OP\u2019s concern is very legitimate.", "Yeah not to justify shitty behavior (because even teenagers are capable of just being shitty), but I think lots of people are generally kind of assholes at 18. I was. Hell, I lost a full ride scholarship to college because I slacked off, because I didn\u2019t want to be there (I went right into college after high school). \n\nI just worked full time for a few years, and guess what? Now I have a master\u2019s degree making 6 figures. The kid may have some deeper problems that need sorting out, but he could also just be a stupid kid", "It sounds like OP wants him gone and is making it seem like his choice. Her husband also has no expenses anymore for a kid that is not hers. Yay stepmom!", "After the lack of following the simplest rule, clean up after yourself, we started charging for each thing we had to clean up.  Kid didn\u2019t like it and went to other parent\u2019s house where they had no rules, but money was expecked from them for everything.  The ex had no issue taking money from the kids, even stealing it or \u201cborrowing\u201d it only to later say it wouldn\u2019t be paid back.  The kids later wound up here when they had hard times financially because they knew all we wanted was common courtesy while they could get back in their feet.  Sometimes they need to go into the fire to realize how good they had it.", "How are they doing that? It sounds like they've been very supportive. They just don't want rude behavior in the house? Which isn't too much to ask for. It's not like they cut him off 100%. They still offer help and talk to him everyday. Like what more can they do?", "What is he doing to get along with the other ppl in the house?", "That is an option. If they gave him a couple of months to get things together, would that be enough to satisfy all the concerns you have?"]}
