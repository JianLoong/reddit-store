Sorry yo our family sucks.", "NTA\n\nShe maybe your sister but with regards to your home, it's a landlord/tenant relationship. There is a lease signed.

Wow\u2026\n\nAs for my parents, I *did* ask them about that, and it turns out that they sold their house and move into a nursing home where they are catered by other people. Because, according to them, they don\u2019t want to burden my sister with taking care of them when she already has a family to take care of. And well, we know why *I* didn\u2019t take care of them.\n\nThey also told me that if they *knew* that my sister was in trouble, they would have never sold their home and that they would had taken her in a heartbeat, and demanded nothing from her. \n\nAgain, as they said before, because they actually have the heart to think about other people\u2026 unlike me.

Thanks for the comment.\n\nBut for sure, I definitely would have said no from the start when my sister contacted me for help. \n\nBut you know the saying, \u201ca favor for a favor?\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t want to hear them complaining that since they \u201ctechnically\u201d help me, then I should be obliged to help them back. So even if they only helped me for two months, then I felt like they only got two months of me helping them before they should be left to fend for themselves. Like how I was.\n\nI mean, sure it\u2019s vengeful and petty, but I did pay back them \u201chelping\u201d me by helping them back. Even if I didn\u2019t do it completely out of the kindness of my heart. \n\nPlus, it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t warn them beforehand. They knew that I only agreed to two months, they *signed* a lease stating that I will only let them stay for two months, and I even gave them a written eviction notice at the beginning of this month (I couldn\u2019t add it in the post because of character limits) stating that they have until the end of this month to move out. And apparently, it didn\u2019t even *dawn* on them that I was being serious about it until yesterday when I warned them that they only have a week to stay. \n\nSo, they literally had two months to find a new place to stay at (regardless if I helped them or not, which I only did by *constantly* telling them that I will only let them stay with me for two months). But instead of being productive about it, they decided to mess around and now they are finding out the terrible consequences of not taking my words seriously. \n\nAs for their kids, this is where I will sound heartless, but not my circus, not my monkeys. Not counting the fact that they were already disrespectful brats to me from day one, I don\u2019t want to deal with the custodial side of the law relating to taking them in.\n\nI guess the nicest thing that I can do is that I\u2019ll give them back their \u201cgifts\u201d and they can try to see if they can get money back for it. Not sure what they can do with it, if they can do anything with it, but that\u2019s their best shot of getting any kind of money back. Plus, it\u2019s not like I wanted any of the gifts anyways, as I basically placed all of their \u201cgifts\u201d in one of my closets.\n\nBut yeah, I don\u2019t mind the ESH verdict here. \n\nIt\u2019s a nice to see things from a different perspective, you know?", "Honestly, not at all.\n\nIf anything, my parents argued that I was the problem because I was expecting my sister to take care of me even though she had little kids of her own, and that I shouldn\u2019t even be mad about the \u201cmiscommunication\u201d because my sister *tried* to help me to begin with and that she didn\u2019t expect me to be kicked out so soon. \n\nIf anything, they told me that I was mad at the *wrong* people and it was her in-laws\u2019 fault for rightly kicking me out of their property, and not my sister\u2019s for lying to me about her owing the place and not asking her in-laws if I can move in. \n\nAnd that I should have been grateful to my sister for even trying to help me, even if it didn\u2019t work out. \n\nAnd that I was at fault for deciding to leave after one too many arguments with them, which made them NC me, because they couldn\u2019t believe that I had the audacity to \u201crun away.\u201d \n\nThey also argued that since nothing too bad happened to me (like I wasn\u2019t living in the streets, because I actually had friends to help me out), then it\u2019s not something I should be mad about because I was and still am okay at the end. \n\nAnd that my circumstances back then was different from my sister now, because my sister has a husband and two minor children to think about. Whereas it was easier for me, because I only needed to take care of myself back then. \n\nIt\u2019s both the most stupid, but also surprisingly compelling argument that I\u2019ve with them. And it kind of irritates me a bit that they actually got a few points in.\n\nETA: However, some of the things they say were dumb in a way. \n\nLike how they would have never sold their home and let my sister in free of charge and in a heartbeat, because they have a \u201cheart,\u201d unlike me.\n\nOr that I should -at least- let her \u201cwell-behaved\u201d (/s who totally don\u2019t resent me) kids stay with me in case if I\u2019m so adamant of kicking the adults out. Even though I know that having them live with me and separating them from their parents will be an issue.\n\n\nSomeone in the comment recommended that I let my parent know (via my sister, because I\u2019m 90% they blocked me again) if they is any ways that they can see if they can use that money that they got from selling their home to buy a home for my sister, and that they can all live together so that way, *maybe* my sister and her family has a place to stay at.", "Yeah, I admit that I was being petty like that. But a favor for a favor, I guess?\n\nEven if it was for the sake of being petty, because I did let them know that I didn\u2019t plan on letting them stay long-term from the start.\n\nBut no, I gave them constant warning for the last two months. I just couldn\u2019t put all of that in the post, because of the character limits. \n\nI even told my sister straight to her face *multiple time* that I want nothing to do with her after the agreed two months, so she *knew* from the very beginning that I didn\u2019t plan on letting her stick around. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until yesterday before it dawns on then that I was actually being serious.", "Way to go you. I was with the above commenter NTA, but expect to have to evict them. Way to be on top of it and ready to reclaim your space", "> They also told me that if they knew that my sister was in trouble, they would have never sold their home and that they would had taken her in a heartbeat, and demanded nothing from her.\n\nwell in that case good news! They can take all the money they received from buying a home and buy one for your sister. If they don't have the money because they were planning on spending it on their nursing home, I'm sure that for your sister's sake they can all buy a house together instead!", "I don't find their arguments that compelling. Your sister chose to have kids. Your parents act like kids are the only possible way to qualify for family support.\n\nIt sounds like your sister was the golden child of the family.

However as much as I dislike ingrates, I truly despise people who try to take a whole arm when you lend them a hand.", "NTA the two months is the maximum you owed them. Any more than that is just punishing yourself and rewarding their bad behavior.", "NTA. But be prepared to go NC with all of them.  Unfortunately, they are all very selfish & rude for kicking you out.  And now they should expect the same courtesy.  Why should you go out of your way to help them when they couldn't have cared less about you?  So what if your parents broke NC.  That doesn't autimatically make you the AH.  That just makes them AH's as well.", "NTA \\_ you and your parents were no contact for a reason even if they were the ones who initiated it I am guess your life has been ok since.  I am guessing there is a reason you did not try to work it out with them over the last 10 years and they just reinforced that reason.  Stand your ground. Don't let others guilt you. It is not on you that they did not think you were serious and did not even look for a place. It seems to me as they moved in with no intention to follow through on getting out. If the parents are that concerned the sister can move her family to the parents house.", "NTA your parents can take them in if they\u2019re so bothered. this is not your problem and you have already done so much for them.", "American conservative beliefs.\n\nBack then (and she still does now, even if she claimed to \u201csoften\u201d up a bit, although I know she hasn\u2019t), she had the whole \u201cpull yourself by the bootstraps\u201d belief that if I wanted to get something done, then I need to be proactive and do it myself.\n\nSo while she stated that she was willing to house me for a bit \u201cjust to be nice enough to settle my ground in,\u201d I would need to be the one to be \u201csettling everything on my side,\u201d including my basic things like job transfer and packing my own stuff *as well as* paying and picking my own ticket and providing my own transportation to get to \u201cher\u201d house. \n\nAll she did was give me her address and told me to let her know when I got off the airport, so that she can \u201cprepare\u201d a place for me to stay at for when I arrived at the house. \n\nWhich wasn\u2019t even much, because all I got was a couch to sleep on and a light blanket, to which she told me to deal with it for now since she didn\u2019t have more time to prepare better. \n\nShe also warned me beforehand that, while she was willing to let me use her house (like I had access to the kitchen and bathroom); I would be expected to buy my own food and utilities, in addition to paying a fairly cheap rent (it was like only $400 a month back then), since she didn\u2019t believe in giving people \u201chandouts\u201d since she thought that would make them inclined to be lazy. \n\nAs well as being expected to cook and clean for myself and not demand too much from her since she stated that she would be too busy with the kids and that she can\u2019t be there to \u201calways hold my hand\u201d; although on the flip side, she would ask if I would be kind enough to help her out from time to time since she has two little ones and can get \u201ctired\u201d sometimes, although I always declined because it\u2019s not my job to be her caretaker as well. \n\nYou know, just \u201ctough love\u201d to let me know how to be more self-sufficient and responsible. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect to stay long-term anyways, because I only requested to stay with her for only a year so that I could have apt time to find my own place, as to not be too much of a burden. \n\nHowever, since this was all verbal, nothing could be enforced and I was promptly kicked out the day that my sister\u2019s in-laws came back and found out that I was living there. Oh well, life lesson for me to have everything written, so that turned out for the best. \n\nFunny how for all the troubles that she gave to me back then, she magically wants me to reverse that for her situation now because she can\u2019t get her shit together and wonders why I wouldn\u2019t be willing to do more but the bare minimum to help her out. \n\nEven though I did a little more than she ever did like actually paying for all 4 of their plane tickets and providing them (with own money, mind you) with air mattresses and as many pillows and blankets as her and her family needs. \n\nAlthough I also did tell them that they would be providing for their food and utilities as well, which they had no struggle doing as they had the money to pay for nonstop take-outs and ability to buy all sort of expensive \u201cself-care\u201d gadgets. \n\nBut when she demanded for more and wonder why I wasn\u2019t willing to help more, I retort her beliefs back to her, to which she tried to claim that she was sorry for being so wrong and hardheaded back then and that she changed since 10 years ago, and that she didn\u2019t believe in those strict beliefs anymore and became more empathetic and kind to the people who struggled. Since she claimed that she didn\u2019t realized how wrong her beliefs were back then, being a sheltered housewife herself. \n\nBut I don\u2019t believe her, since I know that she\u2019s still a hypocrite who wouldn\u2019t be willing to more than she\u2019s expected to help out with, but expect everyone else to cuddle and cater to her and her family.", "I bet it was paying her parents money to escape (like back payment for raising her)", "Nta. \n\nYou sound level headed, solid and practical - with a good dose of ironic humor\n\nI'm sure a lot of the reason for that is that you've always known you would have to take care of yourself. That's the gift unreliable parents give us.\n\nWe figure out early how to pick ourselves back up and keep it moving. You repaid your debt to your sister. You gave her 60 days to try to find other accommodations. If she didn't use that time, that's certainly not on you. Good luck!", "Had to evict someone, and they destroyed the house.

You know that your nc parents contacting you because of your sister and her family not because they miss you or want to involve with your life?\n1 month and half for your sister and her family staying with you and you nicely calling your sister kids a brat.. Didn't blame you. So my question is.. Are you ready for more rude or bratty kids in your place? And phone call from parents who always think 'you this, you that?'.\nIf you can survive for 10 years without your parents and your sister.. You'll be okay without helping your sister and her family.

Often times they like to cause issues and damages on their way out.", "NTA- I thought about recommending giving them the extra month, so you could say you did more for her than she did for you. However, you have given plenty of notice. If she didn\u2019t take it serious, that\u2019s on her. And, you did do more for her because you took in a whole family.", "Keep us updated.
