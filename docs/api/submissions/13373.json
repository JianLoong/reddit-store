Sorry yo our family sucks.", "NTA\n\nShe maybe your sister but with regards to your home, it's a landlord/tenant relationship. There is a lease signed. Do what you must to enforce the terms of the lease as a landlord.", "I already did. \n\nStarting from last month, I already have gave them a written eviction notice at the beginning of this month, and warn them that I will *actively* sue them in the court process if they do not willing leave by the beginning of next month.\n\nI even told them that I\u2019ll call the police on them for trespassing when I can properly evict them, and that I will go as far as to have their stuff thrown out if they don\u2019t pick it up when the process of eviction is complete. \n\nFor some reason, they didn\u2019t take *any* of that seriously, and are somehow \u201cshocked\u201d that I actually meant what I meant. Wow\u2026\n\nAs for my parents, I *did* ask them about that, and it turns out that they sold their house and move into a nursing home where they are catered by other people. Because, according to them, they don\u2019t want to burden my sister with taking care of them when she already has a family to take care of. And well, we know why *I* didn\u2019t take care of them.\n\nThey also told me that if they *knew* that my sister was in trouble, they would have never sold their home and that they would had taken her in a heartbeat, and demanded nothing from her. \n\nAgain, as they said before, because they actually have the heart to think about other people\u2026 unlike me.

Thanks for the comment.\n\nBut for sure, I definitely would have said no from the start when my sister contacted me for help. \n\nBut you know the saying, \u201ca favor for a favor?\u201d Well, I didn\u2019t want to hear them complaining that since they \u201ctechnically\u201d help me, then I should be obliged to help them back. So even if they only helped me for two months, then I felt like they only got two months of me helping them before they should be left to fend for themselves. Like how I was.\n\nI mean, sure it\u2019s vengeful and petty, but I did pay back them \u201chelping\u201d me by helping them back. Even if I didn\u2019t do it completely out of the kindness of my heart. \n\nPlus, it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t warn them beforehand. They knew that I only agreed to two months, they *signed* a lease stating that I will only let them stay for two months, and I even gave them a written eviction notice at the beginning of this month (I couldn\u2019t add it in the post because of character limits) stating that they have until the end of this month to move out. And apparently, it didn\u2019t even *dawn* on them that I was being serious about it until yesterday when I warned them that they only have a week to stay. \n\nSo, they literally had two months to find a new place to stay at (regardless if I helped them or not, which I only did by *constantly* telling them that I will only let them stay with me for two months). But instead of being productive about it, they decided to mess around and now they are finding out the terrible consequences of not taking my words seriously. \n\nAs for their kids, this is where I will sound heartless, but not my circus, not my monkeys. Not counting the fact that they were already disrespectful brats to me from day one, I don\u2019t want to deal with the custodial side of the law relating to taking them in.\n\nI guess the nicest thing that I can do is that I\u2019ll give them back their \u201cgifts\u201d and they can try to see if they can get money back for it. Not sure what they can do with it, if they can do anything with it, but that\u2019s their best shot of getting any kind of money back. Plus, it\u2019s not like I wanted any of the gifts anyways, as I basically placed all of their \u201cgifts\u201d in one of my closets.\n\nBut yeah, I don\u2019t mind the ESH verdict here. \n\nIt\u2019s a nice to see things from a different perspective, you know?", "Honestly, not at all.\n\nIf anything, my parents argued that I was the problem because I was expecting my sister to take care of me even though she had little kids of her own, and that I shouldn\u2019t even be mad about the \u201cmiscommunication\u201d because my sister *tried* to help me to begin with and that she didn\u2019t expect me to be kicked out so soon. \n\nIf anything, they told me that I was mad at the *wrong* people and it was her in-laws\u2019 fault for rightly kicking me out of their property, and not my sister\u2019s for lying to me about her owing the place and not asking her in-laws if I can move in. \n\nAnd that I should have been grateful to my sister for even trying to help me, even if it didn\u2019t work out. \n\nAnd that I was at fault for deciding to leave after one too many arguments with them, which made them NC me, because they couldn\u2019t believe that I had the audacity to \u201crun away.\u201d \n\nThey also argued that since nothing too bad happened to me (like I wasn\u2019t living in the streets, because I actually had friends to help me out), then it\u2019s not something I should be mad about because I was and still am okay at the end. \n\nAnd that my circumstances back then was different from my sister now, because my sister has a husband and two minor children to think about. Whereas it was easier for me, because I only needed to take care of myself back then. \n\nIt\u2019s both the most stupid, but also surprisingly compelling argument that I\u2019ve with them. And it kind of irritates me a bit that they actually got a few points in.\n\nETA: However, some of the things they say were dumb in a way. \n\nLike how they would have never sold their home and let my sister in free of charge and in a heartbeat, because they have a \u201cheart,\u201d unlike me.\n\nOr that I should -at least- let her \u201cwell-behaved\u201d (/s who totally don\u2019t resent me) kids stay with me in case if I\u2019m so adamant of kicking the adults out. Even though I know that having them live with me and separating them from their parents will be an issue.\n\n\nSomeone in the comment recommended that I let my parent know (via my sister, because I\u2019m 90% they blocked me again) if they is any ways that they can see if they can use that money that they got from selling their home to buy a home for my sister, and that they can all live together so that way, *maybe* my sister and her family has a place to stay at.", "Yeah, I admit that I was being petty like that. But a favor for a favor, I guess?\n\nEven if it was for the sake of being petty, because I did let them know that I didn\u2019t plan on letting them stay long-term from the start.\n\nBut no, I gave them constant warning for the last two months. I just couldn\u2019t put all of that in the post, because of the character limits. \n\nI even told my sister straight to her face *multiple time* that I want nothing to do with her after the agreed two months, so she *knew* from the very beginning that I didn\u2019t plan on letting her stick around. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until yesterday before it dawns on then that I was actually being serious.", "Way to go you. I was with the above commenter NTA, but expect to have to evict them. Way to be on top of it and ready to reclaim your space", "> They also told me that if they knew that my sister was in trouble, they would have never sold their home and that they would had taken her in a heartbeat, and demanded nothing from her.\n\nwell in that case good news! They can take all the money they received from buying a home and buy one for your sister. If they don't have the money because they were planning on spending it on their nursing home, I'm sure that for your sister's sake they can all buy a house together instead!", "I don't find their arguments that compelling. Your sister chose to have kids. Your parents act like kids are the only possible way to qualify for family support.\n\nIt sounds like your sister was the golden child of the family. They've been treating her like royalty and you like an afterthought for years.\n\nI'm glad you got away from them. This is most definitely not your bag to hold. Not even a little bit.

You deserve better.", "Thank you!\n\nUnlike my dumbass sister, I actually try to prepare myself for things.\n\nProbably one of the reason why I didn\u2019t struggle that hard with being kicked out, because I was always trying to make connections with other people, and back-up plans in case things goes wrong. \n\nI\u2019m going to give a shout-out to my friend Emmy though, she was the only who came in clutch with her having a place to me to stay!", "That\u2019s actually such a great idea!\n\nI\u2019ll make sure to relay that to my sister now, so that way she can ask our parents about it!\n\nBecause, I\u2019m 90% sure that my parents blocked me again for being heartless enough to let them know that I don\u2019t plan on letting my sister stay with me any longer than she needs to be.", "Thank you, although it\u2019s more like they decided to do away with me.\n\nBut I definitely had been happier not to have as much contact, as every single conversation just turns into an argument. \n\nAnd I\u2019m more than happy to NC my sister and her family once they gets evicted out of my condo. I\u2019m going to wash my hands with them by hopefully this week or sometime within the next month.\n\nAnd yeah, my sister is only really the \u201cgolden child,\u201d because she decided to do everything that my parents expected her to do.\n\nGo to college instead of straight to the work field like me, decide to go straight into the dating field instead of building a career like I did, decide to have married and kids by her mid-20\u2019s instead of being a childless spinster like me, etc.\n\nHell, my sister was only the more favored from when we were younger, because she had more feminine interest like wanting to gymnastics and ballet, whereas I wanted to do martial arts and sports. \n\nOh, and that my sister was also more smarter (she was a straight A student who would constantly push herself to take honors/AP classes) and was able to make it to college; whereas I only made like B\u2019s and C\u2019s (and only took like *one* honors class at most) and opt out of college in favor for the work field. \n\nFunny how the \u201cunderachieving\u201d child of the family ends up better than the golden child was. \n\nThank you for listening to my rant, by the way.", "You're welcome.
