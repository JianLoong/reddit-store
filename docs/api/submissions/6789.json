He doesn\u2019t want to get Uber as it will be costly. I told him to get a bus from his town to mine and I will pick him up from the station on the way to work. It will only add extra 5 mins  to my commute. He refused as he will have to get ready very early (the bus trip will take about 20mins). So I said no I can\u2019t pick him up and he got mad and called me AH.\n\nI do feel really bad because Uber will be expensive but I  don\u2019t feel like waking up early and adding to my commute just to drive him.

Your proposition was fair, your co-worker is being unreasonable.", "NTA but your co worker is. He doesn\u2019t want to get up earlier but wants you to do so. Hmmm. \n\nAs far as him calling you an asshole. I don\u2019t know your work environment but if he\u2019s calling you names and making unreasonable requests, report him to HR.", "NTA so he is not willing to compromise at all but  you need to do all the accommodations. Tell him to buy a bike.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour co-worker was trying to manipulate you. Detour and adding another 30 minutes means you'd need to get up close to an hour earlier so you can leave earlier. Just like if he were to take the bus to your down he'd need to get up earlier and get ready and leave earlier.  To him, it's perfectly okay to put that burden on you, but not him.  \n\n\nYour offer to pick him up with a small detour was a great solution that didn't cost either of you a ton of extra time. He declined the offer, he can find his own ride from someone else.", "NTA.\n\nI am in a similar situation to your co-worker. \nRural location, no car.\n\nI have a asked a coworker to drive me to work but made it very clear they are doing me the favour.\nI get up early and am ready to go for their schedule, not mine. \nIf they cannot/do not take me on a certain day, I take the bus.\n\nYour an adult, figure it out.", "How is this remotely Your problem?

He has no problem with asking you to get up half an hour early but isn\u2019t willing to do the same when he\u2019s asking for the favor? Entitled to the max", "NTA. You suggested a very reasonable alternative.", "NTA. \n\nIt sucks his car broke down but he has alternatives, he just doesn't want to take them because it would inconvenience him. Yet he has no problem that you'd be inconvenienced.", "NTA \n\nThe entitlement of your coworker thinking they can just demand you drive half an hour out of your way each way, every day and then call you an AH for passing on such a golden opportunity. \n\nHe's the AH and don't let him make you think it's the other way around", "NTA - The ABSOLUTE ENTITLEMENT just astounded me. \n\n>he lives in a different town from me which means I will have to detour and add another 30 mins to my commute.\n\nYeah, that'd be a ridiculously HARD no for me too.", "NTA, so he wants *you* to get up earlier so he doesn\u2019t have to get up earlier?

You would've had to have gone out of your way as it was and that wasn't enough.", "NTA. He can take the bus the whole damn way. Or walk. \n\nSeriously, he apparently commutes farther than you each day, and that should figure into his calculations of what's reasonable to ask. This isn't.", "NTA - you're not a taxi service. Offering to pick him up from a station en route is very reasonable. He refused your offer, his problem.", "NTA\n\nIf you did pick him up you would need to wake up earlier and if he took the bus he would need to wake up p early...

Would he even be paying you for the extra gas money if you went to pick him up? He doesn't want to pay for an Uber, but would he pay you for the extra trip? You offered him a great compromise but he refused. That should be the end of it.\n\nI get that everything sucks when your car breaks down. I live in the countryside with no buses except the schoolbus so when my car broke down it really SUCKED since I didn't have any alternative transports. So I did ask a friend if she could drive me to work, but she lives in another village a bit further from town than me so even if it's not her usual way it takes the same amount of time to drive past my village instead and we worked in the same building and began work roughly about the same time. It was very little effort from her side to do me this favour.", "NTA\n\nHe wants you to be massively inconvenienced because he can\u2019t be bothered to get up earlier.

Not your responsibility to make sure other people get to work on time or even go to work. Fuck that guy as others have said.

I Uber to work b/c busing will take me about 30 mins longer. It\u2019s $15 vs $5 and I won\u2019t stand for it in the morning.
