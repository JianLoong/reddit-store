He doesn\u2019t want to get Uber as it will be costly. I told him to get a bus from his town to mine and I will pick him up from the station on the way to work. It will only add extra 5 mins  to my commute. He refused as he will have to get ready very early (the bus trip will take about 20mins). So I said no I can\u2019t pick him up and he got mad and called me AH.\n\nI do feel really bad because Uber will be expensive but I  don\u2019t feel like waking up early and adding to my commute just to drive him.

Your proposition was fair, your co-worker is being unreasonable.", "NTA but your co worker is. He doesn\u2019t want to get up earlier but wants you to do so. Hmmm. \n\nAs far as him calling you an asshole. I don\u2019t know your work environment but if he\u2019s calling you names and making unreasonable requests, report him to HR.", "NTA so he is not willing to compromise at all but  you need to do all the accommodations. Tell him to buy a bike.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour co-worker was trying to manipulate you. Detour and adding another 30 minutes means you'd need to get up close to an hour earlier so you can leave earlier. Just like if he were to take the bus to your down he'd need to get up earlier and get ready and leave earlier.  To him, it's perfectly okay to put that burden on you, but not him.  \n\n\nYour offer to pick him up with a small detour was a great solution that didn't cost either of you a ton of extra time. He declined the offer, he can find his own ride from someone else.", "NTA.\n\nI am in a similar situation to your co-worker. \nRural location, no car.\n\nI have a asked a coworker to drive me to work but made it very clear they are doing me the favour.\nI get up early and am ready to go for their schedule, not mine. \nIf they cannot/do not take me on a certain day, I take the bus.\n\nYour an adult, figure it out.", "How is this remotely Your problem?

You suggested a very reasonable alternative.", "NTA. \n\nIt sucks his car broke down but he has alternatives, he just doesn't want to take them because it would inconvenience him.

Who need the rid? Some people are just entitled! Yeah he needs to call Uber or take a day off.", "NTA. You are not his chauffer. You have offered help, but he wants uber service without paying for it. A decent person would have accepted your offer and would have paid for gas.", "NTA\n\nHe's asking you to get ready 30min earlier because he doesn't want to get ready 20min earlier?

If he refuses to accommodate that request, he can figure out how to get to work another way. He's the asshole. What an entitled jerk.", "NTA, carpooling is great! But it has to work for everyone. Would he even be paying you for the extra gas money if you went to pick him up? He doesn't want to pay for an Uber, but would he pay you for the extra trip? You offered him a great compromise but he refused. That should be the end of it.\n\nI get that everything sucks when your car breaks down. I live in the countryside with no buses except the schoolbus so when my car broke down it really SUCKED since I didn't have any alternative transports. So I did ask a friend if she could drive me to work, but she lives in another village a bit further from town than me so even if it's not her usual way it takes the same amount of time to drive past my village instead and we worked in the same building and began work roughly about the same time. It was very little effort from her side to do me this favour.", "NTA\n\nHe wants you to be massively inconvenienced because he can\u2019t be bothered to get up earlier.

Not your responsibility to make sure other people get to work on time or even go to work. Fuck that guy as others have said.

I Uber to work b/c busing will take me about 30 mins longer. It\u2019s $15 vs $5 and I won\u2019t stand for it in the morning.

If he is giving you problems at work because of this HR needs to be notified immediately and make sure they know the back story that led to his new behavior.", "Definitely NTA.

So, it's o.k. for you to have to leave 30 mins earlier, when you're not the one asking for a favor, but God forbid this guy has to leave 20 mins earlier so that he's less of an inconvenience to others helping him out? And then he has the audacity to call you an ah?\n\nThis guy doesn't need a ride, he needs a reality check.", "NTA and this Dude needs to realise it is also not your problem", "NTA Wow she he wants you make all the compromise and he gets all the benefits.\n\nIf he truly wanted a lift he would meet you half way.", "Don\u2019t trust a 30+ year old that can\u2019t preserve his car.\n\nNTA, don\u2019t waste your time entertaining this fool.", "Don\u2019t forget the extra hour on the back end to take him home and then driving to your home.", "NTA very fair compromise, but he is being a choosy beggar.", "NTA.\nHe wants you to add 1 hour a day to your drive (I'm assuming you meant an extra 30mins per trip by detouring to his town) so that he doesn't have to catch 40mins worth of busses a day.

Anybody calling you out can go and drive him around themselves.", "NTA\n\nIs he planning on paying the petrol costs for you to come get him? Why do you need to be the one to get up earlier in order to get him when it's HIS problem?", "NTA - it is his job to make it easier for you to help him not the other way around. He wants you to have to get up earlier and spend extra money on gas plu wear/tear on your car so his commute can stay the same. That's a hard no.", "NTA. I used to do this for a co-worker, went 30 mins out of my way to and from work to pick her up and drop them off. She never offered to help pay for gas and expected me to do it daily (they didn't own a car and used public transportation prior to me doing this). I stopped doing it and they complained to our manager, who then called me into his office and asked why I was no longer giving her a ride. I may have been rude but I asked him if my car was mine or the company's and since we were paid travel why it was my responsibility and why didn't he do it if he was so concerned and lived in her neighborhood. He dropped it and she had to find her own transportation as he never gave her a ride either. Of course he proceeded to passive aggressive persecute me at the office until he got fired for stealing from the company.", "NTA - You gave him an option. He didn't like it. You're not required to set yourself on fire to keep others warm. That extra 30 minutes adds up fast in time and gas money twice a day, and is *longer* than his 20 minute bus ride. Dude is entitled. Be professional and, should it come up at the office, point out his 20 minute bus ride is shorter than your 30 minute detour. Look confused as to why he'd expect you to go out of your way even more than he's willing to.", "NTA. You would be doing him a favor but he doesn't want to be inconvenienced at all. He wants you to be his free Uber.", "You\u2019re not his mother. His car is out of commission and he expects you to lose an hour of your day for door to door taxi service when he can\u2019t get his behind up early? Right.", "He's also adding to the cost of gasoline and maintenance on the vehicle. You know, the things that a taxi or Uber would charge for.", "Yep good point. I imagine someone behaving as entitled as his coworker would not have the courtesy of pitching in without being asked to."]}
