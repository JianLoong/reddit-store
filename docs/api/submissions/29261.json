The hosts/others eating shouldn't be hounding you about it. Asking once and potentially offering another option is fine, continuing to ask is rude.  \n\nYou getting fed up and insulting the cooking was also rude.

They ask, you answer and they ask again. Maybe they didn't hear, you repeat. They ask again - okay now they are trying to make a point.\n\nYou might have been brought up not to \"make a scene\" or \"be overly dramatic\", which may lead you to not allowing yourself to have a valid response. You hold it in and try to be polite and hold it in and then suddenly you BLOW UP.\n\nIf you can learn to express yourself sooner, you won't blow up so big and then feel badly about that. It took me years to learn to do this, it's not over night.\n\nTurn it around: when you realize the other person is being rude. \"But why not eat it?\" \"Oh, I am so sorry, Sally, <gets really loud and really slow? I ... did ... not ... realize ... you ... are ... hard ... of ... hearing.  I ... am ... not ... that ... hungry.\"\n\nSally's offended face: \"No, I just want to know why you aren't eating....\" \n\nYou, confused face: \"Why? What is it to you? That's a really odd question to ask someone. I am not hurting anyone that I know of <look at host inquiringly> so, I am not sure why you are so focused on this. Oh, did you just get diagnosed with something? Are you on the spectrum? Nothing wrong with that, but if so, maybe you should know that pushing people about what they eat is not considered polite.\" \n\nSally's offended face.\n\nI had someone get on my case at a dinner party in exactly the same way, when the host served me a salad that didn't have any peppers in it. A big bowl came out that everyone got salad from but me - my lovely, kind host brought me a small bowl of my own with no peppers as she knew I didn't like / couldn't handle peppers. And two people at the table just went off on me and what a terrible person I was and how I was insulting the host for not eating what everyone else was eating.\n\nAnd honestly, I was so surprised at the outright effrontery of telling me what I could and could not eat and my host was equally surprised that at a *Diplomatic Dinner* these two people in the Diplomatic Corps did this, the rest of us just stared at them in disbelief for a few seconds and then I said that my host was being kind to me and I wouldn't disrepect her kindness and the host was like \"I do for my friends, I know she doesn't like them\" and they interrupted all \"she shoul djust grow up and eat what's in front of her\" and bless one of the other people there whotold them that they should grow up and keep their opinions out of other people's food. And they finally realized they were getting the stink eye from everyone and shut up but were always mad at ME because I *made them* look bad.\n\nI never even would have thought to ask if I was TA, cuz we all knew they were.", "ESH. One type of fish was originally planned. Upon hearing the menu OP declined the invitation. The host, who had seen OP eat a different type of fish,changed to what the thought OP would eat. For some reason, at the actual dinner, OP didn't like the fish, which had been selected because of OP. \n\nNow, other guests stupidly hounded OP for not eating the fish. They should have left it alone, but who knows. So these people are wrong. OP has every right not to eat the fish. The other guests should not have hounded OP. But OP' s statement didn't chastise them for their poor behavior. It appeared to attack the one person who changed their menu just for OP and who didn't question OP about the fish. This makes OP an AH.\n\nFinal thought. By saying it doesn't taste good kind of implies that the fault lies in the chef. Sounds like OP just doesn't like fish. It could be the most delicious fish ever to everyone else. My mother absolutely hated lobster, it was a texture thing. She would always decline citing her personal objection,  saying, it looks delicious, but unfortunately lobster's texture has never agreed with me.", "NTA you clearly made in known you weren't interested and then they harass you about eating something you told them you didn't want to eat, after ignoring your feelings and demanding you come, your patience was admirable and maybe next time they will listen when you try to decline.", "NTA. You tried to be polite. They wouldn\u2019t take a hint and let it go. If people keeping pushing, I\u2019m not sure why they\u2019re surprised when you then snap at them.", "Nta.

You were right to start by deflecting, but when that didn't work, you kept going until you snapped. The next option after deflection would have been to either lie about why you're not eating the fish or to just shut it down, i.e. use one of your deflections, followed up with \"I'm not discussing this anymore\" and changing the subject. If you absolutely needed to give the genuine answer, then you need to phrase it differently \"It's not good\" implies the fault is with the dish, which is rude. \"It's not to my taste\" or \"It's a little too fishy for me\" would have been both more polite and more accurate since it wasn't that the dish was bad, you just didn't like it", "YTA... It's not that it didn't taste good, it was that it wasn't to you liking. You could learn some manners.", "All you have to say is \"sorry i dont like how this tastes\"", "NTA. It was a family thing and your responses indicate this is something that happens regularly. It was nice of them to try and accommodate you and you did actually try the fish. Sure you could have grinned and bore it but then they\u2019d think you liked it and would serve it at every gathering. You tried to be diplomatic with your response and kept getting hounded until you snapped. The only thing you maybe could have done differently was use an I/me statement example: \u201cIt\u2019s too fishy for my taste.\u201d What you said kinda of puts the \u201cblame\u201d on the cook like they made a bad meal and not on your taste buds (where it should be and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that).", "YTA, because you could have put it a different way than that.", "You YTA people but have the patience of saints and never lose your cool at a rude person pestering you.", "ESH. They shouldn't have hounded you, but you were rude.\n\nFor those who say \"just eat it and pretend to like\" - there is zero ways I could eat raw oysters. I would literally gag it. I don't care about politeness when I will literally gag. My partner cannot stand most fish except tuna, and 100% cannot stand seaweed and nori, nor any caviar/fish roe. I have seen/heard him gag and then puke when he tried eating it. And most soured and cultured milk products taste spoiled to him, so no sour cream, most yogurts, ranch, kefir, etc. Sometimes you just *can't.* And it's fine, be polite about it, but adult people should know to leave you alone.", "YTA. I\u2019ve been in your shoes. However, yelling \u201cbecause it doesn\u2019t taste good\u201d was rude. You could have just left it at \u201cI felt like salad today.\u201d \n\nEven my 6 year old picky eater knows that\u2019s rude. For example for my sons birthday last year my grandma-in-law insisted on cooking dinner and buying the cake. I had wanted to order it but my husband just said to go along with it as it\u2019s one thing off my plate. She ended up making a bunch of food that my son and I hated and bought a Bundt cake because it\u2019s what my SIL requested. My son was so disappointed when he saw the cake with no frosting since that\u2019s his favorite part but he didn\u2019t say a word he just ate a few bites. He just said he wasn\u2019t feeling well. He had been sick a few days before hand so this was believable. As soon as we got in the car he asked to go to Taco Bell and if I could get him a real cake the next day.", "YTA\n\nOther guest ITA.\n\nHost is a saint. Having cooked something specifically just to suit you, because you have some picky eating habit, you were then a dick about it and they didn't immediately throw you out.", "ESH - It's rude to try to force people to eat something they don't like, in this case the fish. \n\nBut it's also tactless to say something doesn't taste good, implying the cook did a bad job rather than you just don't like that they cooked fish.", "YTA. You write very well for a two year old.", "Of course YTA. Presumably you\u2019re not a six year old. Grow up and have some manners.", "NTA in my opinion. You do NOT have to eat food that you don't like even to be polite. If I've tasted it and I don't like it and you ask me why I'm not eating it, you are getting immediately \"Sorry but I don't like it and I'm happy to eat this salad.\"  Taste buds are different, just because you don't like it doesn't mean no one else does, it's not an insult to the cook. And I would NEVER choke down food I hated just to make someone else happy.", "Because it wasn't the host pestering you, I have to say ESH. The behavior of those asking you about what you were eating, or not eating, was terrible. There wasn't a good reason for them to ask you once let alone several times because they didn't get the answers they wanted. However, you response about the fish not tasting good lacked tact and insulted the host, who wasn't pestering you. If you were going to blow up, you could have said, \"quit badgering me,\" or, \"quit asking me about what I'm eating,\" or, \"what's it to you,\" or any number of other things where your ire is directed at those bothering you instead of at the food.", "NTA.

Nobody makes food specially for me if they are making a meal like be thankful these people seem to care about you and making you happy. You reacted like a child.", "NTA - I think you were put into a position where that was the only way you could answer. You tried to deflect and they kept asking.
