{"id": 5877, "submission_id": "zxiha1", "title": "AITA for ditching my 15 year old stepson?", "selftext": "I am a 34 year old woman engaged to Greg (35). Greg and his ex-wife Sheila were divorced before we met and had a son, Codey. One of the reasons why they divorced is that Codey needed a lot of extra help, and Greg believed Sheila should quit her job and stay home with Codey, while Sheila felt he needed professional help. I was extremely young and naive when I met Greg, and he convinced me to quit my own job and stay home with Codey. Once we had our own two children, this became untenable. I still stayed home but I could not care for them AND Codey on my own, so we brought in professional help anyway. I feel that a gigantic chunk of my life has been wasted trying to help someone who has turned out to be a very nasty person. Codey behaves as a malignant narcissist and always has. This is not normal childhood behavior. My kids don't behave this way at all and I feel my kids have actually been damaged by the abuse dished out by Codey. He's demanding, has zero empathy, and believes the world revolves around him. He prefers to live here instead of with Sheila because Sheila doesn't spoil him while Greg insists on doing so. So I've ended up playing the \"mom\" role in his life the majority of the time. Sheila like me also has young children Codey is horrible to. Greg also spends all his time working and I'm just about done with this relationship. Codey has unlimited access to the internet and I don't know what he's been watching, but I suspect it's something extremely toxic. He started making many sexist remarks to and about me, and my daughter, and trying to get my 10 year old son to join in, which my son was not interested in doing, and is very wary of Codey.   \n\n\nOne day Codey left an absolutely disgusting mess which he trailed from the kitchen to his bedroom. I asked him what that was all about and he said \"don't bother me woman cleaning is YOUR job.\" I had enough and told Codey in no uncertain terms to clean it up immediately. He replied, \"don't tell me what to do you stupid #### ##### you're not my fucking parent.\"  \n\n\nI closed the door and walked away and in that moment I was done with Codey for good. I felt a wonderful sense of relief as he told me I was not his parent therefore I had no responsibility to him and could just walk away. Even with Greg we've been engaged for 10 years but we never married so I can just walk. I overheard Codey later chatting to someone boasting how he had \"broke me\" and \"turned me submissive.\" LOL. It took Codey a while to notice I was done with his shit as I was preparing to move out. First he doubled down and verbally attacked me with the most disgusting slurs you can imagine. Eventually HE \"broke\" and became a sobbing little boy telling me he was sorry and afraid of losing me. I felt nothing but disgust. Greg is furious I'm leaving and saying I'm the one who is disgusting. I am done with both of them AITA for ditching my 15 year old stepson who says he \"needs me?\"", "created_utc": 1672255664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxiha1/aita_for_ditching_my_15_year_old_stepson/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course, you\u2019re not the asshole for prioritizing your physical and mental health, not to mention that if your children- does seem very likely, as if your physical health could be in danger in the future.\n\nDoes Cody have a diagnosis? What kind of professional help did he get out of interest? I am the mother of an autistic 19 year old son and I have so much empathy for you. He\u2019s absolutely wonderful, but it was a close one thing there. Lots and lots of professional help has turned him into a delightful young man who is true to his spirit. But sometimes I have to be his empathy check still.\n\nThat said, one huge thing jumped out to me. Why have you been engaged for 10 years and not married ? Iget that it works for you in this situation and it helps you leave, but it makes me feel that Greg has been keeping you around to care for Cody.

Cody is behaving like an asshole, but I\u2019m not going to call him an asshole. He needs help. And this short, sharp shock. If you leaving due to his behavior is exactly the kind of thing that can turn it around, but only if therapy is given. He hast to understand the consequences of his actions.\n\nHe also needs to learn empathy. Which can be done with great therapy. Trust me in the absence of a sociopathic diagnosis he can still be turned around, but you have to take care of yourself. You only have one experience of mothering your children.  NTA", "NTA.

Sheila was correct and Greg is/was in denial. It will be fun to search inmate databases once Codey is 18, that\u2019s where he\u2019s heading if he doesn\u2019t get loads of professional help ASAP.

It's not your responsibility to care for him and you have the right to set boundaries and protect yourself and your own family.

Also, mention that Greg does not seem to see an issue with Codey being around the younger children. \n\nHis behaviour towards you and your children is dangerous. Get away and make it clear to Greg that your children - especially your daughter - are never to be alone with Codey (hopefully Greg will see the safety of his two younger children as a priority too).", "NTA you're right to get the hell out. Protect yourself and your children", "NTA - Run! Greg has enabled this horrible behavior and this will only get worse. It sounds as if Greg wants a live-in maid/nanny and not a partner.

The fact that your son is ten leads me to believe you\u2019ve been caring for the stepson for at least 10 years, since he was 5. At this point, I don\u2019t think you can claim you\u2019ve had no hand in his behavior and it is certainly irresponsible, at least morally, for you to wash your hands of the situation.

What is your alternative to leaving? And the father needs to step up and quit spoiling him and letting him get away with everything! She can\u2019t do shit if he goes and takes away any sort of power she has as a step parent!"]}
