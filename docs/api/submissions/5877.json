{"id": 5877, "submission_id": "zxiha1", "title": "AITA for ditching my 15 year old stepson?", "selftext": "I am a 34 year old woman engaged to Greg (35). Greg and his ex-wife Sheila were divorced before we met and had a son, Codey. One of the reasons why they divorced is that Codey needed a lot of extra help, and Greg believed Sheila should quit her job and stay home with Codey, while Sheila felt he needed professional help. I was extremely young and naive when I met Greg, and he convinced me to quit my own job and stay home with Codey. Once we had our own two children, this became untenable. I still stayed home but I could not care for them AND Codey on my own, so we brought in professional help anyway. I feel that a gigantic chunk of my life has been wasted trying to help someone who has turned out to be a very nasty person. Codey behaves as a malignant narcissist and always has. This is not normal childhood behavior. My kids don't behave this way at all and I feel my kids have actually been damaged by the abuse dished out by Codey. He's demanding, has zero empathy, and believes the world revolves around him. He prefers to live here instead of with Sheila because Sheila doesn't spoil him while Greg insists on doing so. So I've ended up playing the \"mom\" role in his life the majority of the time. Sheila like me also has young children Codey is horrible to. Greg also spends all his time working and I'm just about done with this relationship. Codey has unlimited access to the internet and I don't know what he's been watching, but I suspect it's something extremely toxic. He started making many sexist remarks to and about me, and my daughter, and trying to get my 10 year old son to join in, which my son was not interested in doing, and is very wary of Codey.   \n\n\nOne day Codey left an absolutely disgusting mess which he trailed from the kitchen to his bedroom. I asked him what that was all about and he said \"don't bother me woman cleaning is YOUR job.\" I had enough and told Codey in no uncertain terms to clean it up immediately. He replied, \"don't tell me what to do you stupid #### ##### you're not my fucking parent.\"  \n\n\nI closed the door and walked away and in that moment I was done with Codey for good. I felt a wonderful sense of relief as he told me I was not his parent therefore I had no responsibility to him and could just walk away. Even with Greg we've been engaged for 10 years but we never married so I can just walk. I overheard Codey later chatting to someone boasting how he had \"broke me\" and \"turned me submissive.\" LOL. It took Codey a while to notice I was done with his shit as I was preparing to move out. First he doubled down and verbally attacked me with the most disgusting slurs you can imagine. Eventually HE \"broke\" and became a sobbing little boy telling me he was sorry and afraid of losing me. I felt nothing but disgust. Greg is furious I'm leaving and saying I'm the one who is disgusting. I am done with both of them AITA for ditching my 15 year old stepson who says he \"needs me?\"", "created_utc": 1672255664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxiha1/aita_for_ditching_my_15_year_old_stepson/", "score": 809, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
