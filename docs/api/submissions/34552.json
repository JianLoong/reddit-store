When we met I was going through a rough divorce where my now ex(let\u2019s call her K) had cheated on me and gotten pregnant by another man while I was away for the Army. K and I had been separated for about a year when I met my P. When P got pregnant I proposed because I wanted a family unit and my child to not grow up in a broken home.\n\n Fast forward 11 years and my wife and I are searching for a new church home in our area. She went to this church one time 4-5 years ago and loved it, so she suggested we try it out. \n\nWe walked in and loved the vibe, and the kids area seemed awesome. We got to the sanctuary and started worship when I noticed about three rows to my left was K and the guy she is with. I was frozen for a few minutes and then had to leave. I couldn\u2019t stand to be in the same room as her.\n\nNow my wife is saying because I am still that angry she feels like a consolation prize because I never delt with the anger and hurt that K caused me.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit : thank you all for your input. Here to answer a few questions I\u2019ve seen pop up.\n\n1 ) yes this just happened today. We had a long conversation about this shortly after I posted this, I just wanted some non-biased opinions.\n\n2) as many of you pointed out we initially married for duty. We liked each other at that point but the first 3-5 years of our marriage were hard. The only reason we\u2019re still together (we will both tell you) is because we were legally married. The last 5 years of our life has been wonderful and I do love P with all my heart and am excited to spend the rest of my life with her.\n\nLastly, many of you pointed out that I never healed, or dealt with the trauma, and you\u2019re right. I never went to therapy, talked to anybody etc. my coping mechanism was to throw myself 80+ hours a week into work and cry myself to sleep at night. Then I met P, and life has been a whirlwind since. I did not know K lived in my city as she used to live about 30 miles from where I currently reside, and I have had no contact (verbal or visual) since the divorce so I didn\u2019t have to deal with it. \n\nI have decided that i will be pursuing professional help both individually and as a couple with P to help us work through all this.\n\nThank you so much for those who took the time to respond and give honest feedback.\n", "created_utc": 1704655024, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190zvli/aita_for_making_my_wife_leave_church/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You shouldn\u2019t have to miss out on this church that you seem to enjoy because K is there, she shouldn\u2019t have that much control over you and I am very sorry to hear that she hurt you in such a way.\n\nI think you may benefit from seeing someone and learning how to heal from that experience. You should be able to enjoy going to church with your family. Hoping for the best for you!", "NTA. Being betrayed like that hurts and causes more damage than people can imagine, and I can understand never wanting to be in the same place as them again.", "NTA for your first reaction. I doubt if someone cheated on her, and the affair resulted in a child, she'd want to see them at church every week either. However, I think it best if you think it through; you were most likely in shock, and you DO like the church (a lot, it seems). Think it through, the church seems fine, and you can ignore/try to ignore your ex and her new family.", "NAH - it can be a shock to walk in and see someone who hurt you so badly. You certainly weren't expecting that and that's ok. \n\nBUT did this happen today? do you keep bringing it up? Are you still angry/panicked/upset about seeing K there?\n\nIf this didn't happen today and you keep bringing it up, that's not ok. You need to sort that out and as a former Very Angry and Bitter Person\u2122\ufe0f (esp when it came to my xh) I can tell you it will make wonderful improvements to all areas of your life when you can finally let it go. But it'll take some work and your best bet is counseling (religious based or otherwise). It's been 11 years, man. That level of anger for that long will change your brain chemistry and affect your physical body too. Along with your behavior and outlook on life and the way you see the world in general. And your relationships, obviously. Even if you think you've got it packaged up neatly and put on the highest shelf in your brain storage and the box is marked as something completely different. Those little anger gremlins you stuffed in there are sneaky little devils that find lots of ways to poison you without you noticing. \n\nNow, P's feelings are just as valid, but it makes me wonder what other stuff you've brought up over the past 11 years and how frequently because that doesn't seem, to me, like a one off type of feeling for a one off type of situation. \n\nWhy is your anger still so prevalent? Why are you holding on? It doesn't sound like you had any kids with K and have not had regular or any contact, correct? Ks existence should no longer have any effect on the wonderful life you've built with a wonderful, loving, and definitely understanding woman. \n\nAs a former VAaBP\u2122\ufe0f, all I can say really is this:\n1) anger is a secondary emotion, most often to hurt\n2) anger and hurt are both valid emotions, but make sure your (re)action is justifiable and proportionate. It's *really* hard to find that, but it's necessary. \n\nNow, go talk to your beautiful wife. Reassure her. Love on her. And chalk this up to surprise and be prepared to try again at the next service. You may also have other options for the same church - do they offer another service time? Another service day? Attend those temporarily. Getting involved in the church and becoming more comfortable in the physical space (along with some True Effort\u2122\ufe0f self work) might help ease those feelings as well.", "NTA. I understand why you\u2019d be uncomfortable to be in the same room as your ex after all of the pain she caused you. But your wife has a point: after 11 years, why does it still bother you so much? Have you truly healed/moved on from it?", "NAH everyone is allowed to have human emotions without that making them an asshole. Reddit is full of people who need to put down their phones. Shit me included, gotta read more books anyway.", "INFO: how big is this church? Are there multiple services where you could find a different time to go?\n\nI think you need to deal with your reaction. Shock, sure. Feeling enough disgust to leave and want your wife to leave the church as well? that's extreme after 11 years apart.", "Nta you reacted emotionally to a shock you weren\u2019t prepared for. It\u2019s not about whether you \u201cdealt with\u201d your feelings or not, and certainly not about P. However I might consider couples counseling to get into why she felt so devalued and maybe individual counseling if you really haven\u2019t processed that hurt from your past.", "Soft YTA\n\n\nI sympathize, but your wife is right. You need to deal with the anger and emotion you feel when you see K. Counseling, advice, talk to the minister, something. There are a bunch of reasons why, including that she's in your town. Are you going to avoid a store where she might work? What if she's had a kid and your kids and hers are at the same school? \n\nI also question that you do care for your wife, really. You say you married her because she was pregnant and you didn't want your child to grow up in a broken home. Be still my heart, dude. Did you choose this woman as your partner for life, or are you punishing and mistrusting her forever because of your bad past? If so, that's not fair, and you know it. She has nothing to do with your past, and you need to get past it to the point where your wife is #1.", "NTA.\n\nYou love your wife and child.  However, MOST people wouldn't want to join the same church as their cheating ex-wife, her new husband and affair child.  \n\nGetting over something and being confronted by it every Sunday are two incompatible things.", "NTA: As wife number two, I totally understand how it might make your wife feel uncomfortable. However, I never once thought wow I must be second choice because my husband doesn't want to go hang out where his ex wife is.  \nSeems pretty normal to me to not want to go to the same church, even if its big enough to avoid the ex.  \nIf its been many years, you might want to consider therapy though, not because you are in the wrong here. But because it will help you deal with the feelings from the betrayal and make sure you can deal with those feelings when they come up.", "If it was me I would do the same.", "Soft YTA. Your wife has a point: you haven't really processed the hurt and anger if you couldn't stay until the end of the service. \n\nIt's one thing to go home after the service and have an open discussion about the fact that you don't want to go to the same church your ex goes to, but to be unable to stay in the same room for the duration of the service? When you didn't have to interact with them at all? Yeah, she has a point. \n\nIf you have the option, please try therapy to work through your feelings. Don't let this fester anymore. It's in the past and she can no longer hurt you unless you allow her to do so.", "NTA, your wife needs to know that not everything is about her.", "NTA. Even Brad and Jen won\u2019t go to the same events together and it\u2019s been 20 years. Church is a community and you don\u2019t want to be in the same community as her. Totally understandable", "people saying, \"you haven't processed the hurt\" or whatever clearly don't understand how trauma works. i have spent HOURS working through trauma caused by a terrible ex. I've \"moved on,\" so to speak. but recently, i saw her in public, and i started having an anxiety attack. i hadn't thought about her in so long, but just that glance sent me right back. sometimes, that's just how your body and brain react, no matter the internal thoughts and feelings. your history with your horrible ex is not about your wife. she should try and support you and be empathetic to your struggles, not be upset because of them. NTA.", "Yta and controlling af", "NTA. Love how your wife made your trauma all about her. I guess if she needs reassurance, tell her it's not about K, it's about how being cheated on, by anyone, can leave a lasting scar.\n\nThat being said, for your own well-being, it might help to get some counseling just to let this go.", "Yta for leaving a church you both liked. And honestly she is kinda right. It's been over 10 years and you can't even be in the same room? That's gonna cause issues in your relationship now. Go to therapy. Heal from your ex and be good to your wife. Problem fixed. Be happy. Do better. Then what if your ex sees you? Nothing she sees you happier without her. Good.", "Well, your wife can still go to the church. But you don\u2019t have to go-and she can\u2019t make you. There are other churches you can go to if religion and church is so important. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to not want to have anything to do with an ex that hurt you like \u201cK\u201d hurt you. Your current wife could use a good dose  of compassion and a therapist to get TF over her feelings. It\u2019s not about her.

A life and family with that woman was not in the cards for you and had she not done what she did, you wouldn\u2019t have the wife and family you have now. Time to move on. The best revenge is a life well lived.", "Nta but your wife is right to feel how she does, too.", "INFO:\n\nI appreciate she hurt you badly, but have you never considered that if K hadn't cheated, you would likely have still been with/married to K a year later and may never have crossed paths with P?  And if it hadn't been for that, meeting when you did, you wouldn't have the child(ren) you do.\n\nYou are nursing your anger, instead of letting go of it and realising/acknowledging the blessings that were brought into your life after your previous marriage ended.\n\nNow, since you say you proposed in order to have a family unit, I'm not clear if you actually love P. Maybe you didn't love her when you proposed, but that doesn't mean that love couldn't grown in the meantime. I hope you at least consider your child(ren) a blessing. \n\nLet me ask you this (and I don't expect you to answer, just hope you will think) : Do you love your wife? Do you love your child(ren)? Have you struggled with these feelings of anger towards K for the duration of your marriage to P, or are they coming back up now with the shock of seeing her for the first time in so long? Do you think the way thinks ended with K make you appreciate your relationship with P more? And would you consider, for your own wellbeing as well as for the sake of your marriage, getting counselling to deal with these unresolved feelings?\n\nBut what I would appreciate an answer to is : Why did you make your wife leave the church with you, and interrupt the worship which your family were participating in? Whilst *you* couldn't deal with staying in the same church building as your ex, you could have excused yourself and suggested she remain for the rest of the service.", "ESH. You couldn't even be in the same room as your ex from 11 years ago? Your wife also offered you very little grace here.

I can't judge you for wanting to walk out but I also can't judge her for thinking that way. I mean.. the whole reason you got married was because you knocked her up. All of these situations should have been handled emotionally by now, but if its never come up I get why you would have been in a panic mode.", "YTA This deserves a discussion with wife as it appears you emotionally over the past relationship with K and may have to look for a new church if this is not a hurdle you can get over,", "YTA you obviously haven\u2019t gotten over K if you can\u2019t even stand to be in the same church a decade later. You need some help.", "YTA\n\n> I couldn\u2019t stand to be in the same room as her.\n\nP sure \"forgiveness\" is one of your religion's major tenets.", "YTA assuming you\u2019re a Christian, as you\u2019re supposed to forgive those that wronged you.

Don\u2019t let your ex limit what you can do in life.", "NAH. Your gut reaction was completely valid, and I get needing to leave that time. But your wife called you on it and you need to face the reality that you're willing to give up something good for your family over something that happened 10 years ago. Not to mention the fact that the church is a prime place to work through the pain K caused.", "YTA.\n\nIt's clear even in your post that you only proposed because P was pregnant, and when you see K 11 years after the fact you lose the plot and drag your wife out of the building.

Not wanting to join that church is valid, but having such a reaction that you can\u2019t stay for an hour-long service when she\u2019s several rows away and didn\u2019t notice you is extreme.
