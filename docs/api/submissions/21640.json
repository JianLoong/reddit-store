{"id": 21640, "submission_id": "14ttxui", "title": "AITA for not attending my boyfriend's graduation dinner and how I reacted when his grandma asked my GPA?", "selftext": "My (20F) boyfriend (20M) of 1.5 years graduated college in May with a 4.0 GPA with an objectively easier degree (his words). I'm an engineering major who graduates next May (2024).\n\nI attended graduation with his parents and grandma. I had met his parents several times before and Grandma for the first time the night before. Before the ceremony started there was some time for us to talk, when the conversation turned towards academia. Grandma asked me \"What was BF's GPA?\" and I answered \"4.0.\" Then Grandma asked, \"What's *your* GPA?\" I was taken aback, and answered mine (3.538). There was another very awkward pause. His mom (same major as me) then swooped in and said \"that's good! I graduated with a 3.3 or something.\"\n\nWhat Grandma did not know is that my crazy parents equated my worth as a person with my high school GPA. I was yelled at if I brought a grade home less than an A, and they once asked me to get my \"A-\" grades up to \"A.\" I took dual enrollment classes at the same institution that one parent of mine is a professor at; that parent emailed their colleagues to check up on me. Because I was a minor (16/17) at that time, parent was legally allowed to access my grades. An AP English teacher gave me a B as my semester grade in junior year and my parents took my report card, yelled at me, and immediately went to the principal. They pulled out my old essays when talking to the principal as to why I deserved an A and tried to get the teacher fired, but the principal gave me an A since I passed the AP exam. Everyone was happy, so we moved on with life. They have since lessened up a bit, but don't want to see any Cs.\n\nAfter that I was fighting back tears throughout the whole graduation. I felt physically sick and considered leaving halfway through and going back to my apartment. I ended up sobbing in the car on the way home and telling him what grandma said. He is aware on my parents' stance on grades and how it affects me. \n\nThat night, I skipped his graduation dinner because I was crying and still shaken. I didn't want to see Grandma again. His mom was furious and said she never wanted to see me again until BF explained the situation. His dad became sympathetic; mom swept it under the rug and pretended she never said what she said. I'm sure if anyone ever told Grandma about what she said, but I haven't seen any of them since then.\n\nHowever, this is still a frequent topic of discussion between me and my boyfriend. He thinks I'm the one who damaged the relationship between me and his parents and that I'm at fault and need a little more control over my emotions because the GPA question is a \"common one to ask to students.\" He also knows I have my first therapy appointment in August when I get back to our college town and we are both looking forward to it. I don't feel like I'm at fault since I have been deprived of the emotional regulation skills a therapist could provide and can't help that my parents were jerks, but I can also see his point.

You can\u2019t live your life like this. She did you no wrong.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your parents suck. But your boyfriend\u2019s grandma did nothing wrong to you. I would strongly recommend therapy - a simple question about your GPA should not throw you into a traumatized state. Your boyfriend wanted you to celebrate with him - you refused, despite no one actually doing anything to you or saying anything remotely offensive. \n\nI read this post a few times because I figured grandma must have said something offensive and I missed it.", "Slight YTA, how was his grandma supposed to know how your parents were about grades? If it was me, I might\u2019ve been surprised that you knew your GPA down to the thousandths", "YTA\n\nYou aren't the asshole for your emotional reaction. That's what trauma does.\n\nYou are 100% the asshole for your behavior after you calmed down.\n\nThe correct response is to apologize for turning a normal dinner into a massive drama fest.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you feel or are at fault, you are responsible for your behavior.", "Soft YTA. The grandma did nothing wrong.", "YTA, you can\u2019t expect people to know your triggers without you telling them. It\u2019s also a completely reasonable & logical question to ask after talking about bf\u2019s gpa \n\nHopefully therapy will allow you to move forward on this, otherwise job applications will be impossible for you", "YTA (I don\u2019t mean this in a negative way). You really need to work on improving yourself honestly. The way you reacted to 1 question was over the top. I can understand the idea of tying self worth to grades and wanting to feel valued and validated by older adults around you. My parents instilled that in me. So I know. What I also know is that if you don\u2019t work on improving your mental health you will not form good and healthy relationships in future. \n\nLook at the current situation objectively. Grandma just asked you a question. A very annoying but common question. That made you sob inconsolably and lead you to miss your boyfriend\u2019s graduation dinner. Would you want to behave similarly in a professional set up too? In corporates, question about university ranking, GPA, etc come up. Will you be willing to miss an important meeting because someone asked you what your GPA is? \n\nYou need to apologize to your boyfriend and his parents. Acknowledge that your emotions got the better of you and then work on doing better in the future.\n\nEdit to Add: People saying get therapy and you saying you can\u2019t will not give you a free pass. I went to 3 therapists and all 3 were pretty bad. Didn\u2019t help me at all. But I would always listen to friends who encouraged me to be in touch with my feelings and make conscious efforts to regulate emotions. It took me 6-7 years and I like to think I am almost there. Therapy isn\u2019t a magic fix. You have to do the work.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your parents really messed you up on that issue and definitely getting some help to work through that will benefit you. \n\nBut ultimately you made a celebration for him about you when you couldn\u2019t even bring yourself to attend for him. \n\nIt is weird to just come out guns blazing with a GPA question. People are commenting that it\u2019s normal but who tries to make conversation with a student and just starts up \u201cso what\u2019s your GPA?\u201d instead of like what type of jobs are you planning to apply to in that field, what made you choose it, do you like the school, do you plan to continue to a graduate degree, do you play sports? It does come off a bit aggressive tbh. \n\nBut if you literally can\u2019t face someone at a dinner table for being a bit pushy about something that you do have bad experiences with, it\u2019s going to hold you back in life. \n\nImagine if the tables were turned and your bf skipped your graduation dinner because your grandma said his choice of major doesn\u2019t make good money or something and it was a trigger for him. How would you feel?", "YTA\n\nThe grandma had no idea about what happened to you, so her bringing it up wasn\u2019t in any way a dig at you. It honestly seems as you were projecting your problems into the situation and I understand you haven\u2019t gone to therapy but you can still talk to other people about issues your having. Also you not having therapy help isn\u2019t an excuse for being rude and pushing people away ESPECIALLY on the day your bf graduated. It was a day for him to be celebrated for his hard work and your problems did get in the way of him enjoying himself with you so yeah.", "[deleted]", "Your high school GPA has nothing to do with the person that you will become. I fully understand your situation about being hurt. Certain things said are very hurtful when they remind you of a certain situation that threw you back to a very damaging situation to your psyche of not being good enough? I\u2019m guessing but are you from a different culture? Where academic success is more important than anything? Regardless\u2026you may have overreacted a touch but that doesn\u2019t mitigate the hurt you feel. Please get some therapy to help you to get better at handling life situations that you aren\u2019t the best at. I applaud you for making something of yourself and being successful. But deep down it stays with you the fact that your formative years were filled with countless supposed failures. Please be proud of what you have accomplished. And you are worthy of every happiness that the world would throw at you. Don\u2019t ever underestimate yourself. Your alive, making good decisions. Please don\u2019t diminish that!", "YTA", "YTA for not taking any accountability in any of this, and making your BF\u2019s graduation celebrations all about you. Yes, it sounds like your parents were jerks, but it genuinely does not sound like your BF\u2019s parents or grandma were. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re seeking therapy for this, because it will help you to *not* be the AH when similar situations arise in the future. If you want a lasting relationship with this BF, you need to take steps to make things right with his family, because you can\u2019t expect him to go no contact with them over this incident and a long-term relationship where you completely avoid his family will quickly cause resentment and tension.", "You're not an ah, but I do think it is a very good idea that you are going to see a therapist. Therapy is not a magical fix though. You are going to need to work very hard to build emotional regulation skills.", "I have never asked anyone what their GPA is, and I have also never been ask what mine was. \n\nThat\u2019s not a random chit chat question so ask someone.", "Jeezy-peet--YTA. I certainly hope you've apologized to his grandma--none of it is her fault.", "NAH.\n\nYou had an uncontrollable emotional reaction. That being said, it's understandable that your bf is frustrated that something so benign as a GPA question from a grandmother would cause that reaction. If you graduate next year, that means you've been going to college and had access to whatever resources they had to address this for a while now. Again, no AHs here, but I get his frustration. \n\nI think it would be great to figure out (with your therapist and bf) how to mend things with his family. If it's an apology, I'm sure your therapist can help you frame it in a way that's true to you", "YTA. I say this as someone whose anxiety had ruined many events before I finally got stable treatment. This was a school-centered event. It doesn't take a genius to foresee people wanting to talk about school. Surely there was a way to prepare yourself for this eventuality. A prepared answer about your GPA, maybe deflecting to \"3rd in my class!\" or something like that instead of giving the exact number if that number gives you anxiety. I think the GPA question is a little invasive, it's not necessarily grandma's business. But your reaction was WILDLY out of line. Traumatized, shaking, and sobbing for hours? Over 15 seconds worth of small talk? I'm glad you're getting therapy now, but it's probably too little too late regarding your relationship with your partner's family. They will always be walking on eggshells around you, terrified that any conversation will trigger you again. I lost a lot of friends due to my former panic attack reactions for exactly this reason, and I don't blame them. Get treatment, specify you need coping mechanisms for these situations, and don't push contact with your partner's family until they reach out and invite you again.", "seriously? grow up and i feel sorry for your bf who didnt get to have his partner in a once lifetime event because she act like a child", "NTA but glad to see in this feed that you are seeking counseling as your reaction was over the top and unwarranted by what was actually asked.  I can appreciate you were traumatized by your parents' demands and reactions and it is past time to overcome their unreasonable and hurtful treatment of you.  Good luck!", "NTA. Although his grandmother didn\u2019t know, I saw where you said OP, that the conflict is between you and your boyfriend. \n\n\nHonestly, your boyfriend is a bit of TA. He\u2019s aware of your history and that you\u2019re having your *first* therapy appointment when you all return back to campus. The fact that his response to you being accidentally triggered by the questions about your GPA, is to say that you  should have been in better control over your emotions is trash.", "NTA but you could have told your bf about the incident, imo your actions were a little stretched.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
