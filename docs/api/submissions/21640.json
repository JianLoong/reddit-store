{"id": 21640, "submission_id": "14ttxui", "title": "AITA for not attending my boyfriend's graduation dinner and how I reacted when his grandma asked my GPA?", "selftext": "My (20F) boyfriend (20M) of 1.5 years graduated college in May with a 4.0 GPA with an objectively easier degree (his words). I'm an engineering major who graduates next May (2024).\n\nI attended graduation with his parents and grandma. I had met his parents several times before and Grandma for the first time the night before. Before the ceremony started there was some time for us to talk, when the conversation turned towards academia. Grandma asked me \"What was BF's GPA?\" and I answered \"4.0.\" Then Grandma asked, \"What's *your* GPA?\" I was taken aback, and answered mine (3.538). There was another very awkward pause. His mom (same major as me) then swooped in and said \"that's good! I graduated with a 3.3 or something.\"\n\nWhat Grandma did not know is that my crazy parents equated my worth as a person with my high school GPA. I was yelled at if I brought a grade home less than an A, and they once asked me to get my \"A-\" grades up to \"A.\" I took dual enrollment classes at the same institution that one parent of mine is a professor at; that parent emailed their colleagues to check up on me. Because I was a minor (16/17) at that time, parent was legally allowed to access my grades. An AP English teacher gave me a B as my semester grade in junior year and my parents took my report card, yelled at me, and immediately went to the principal. They pulled out my old essays when talking to the principal as to why I deserved an A and tried to get the teacher fired, but the principal gave me an A since I passed the AP exam. Everyone was happy, so we moved on with life. They have since lessened up a bit, but don't want to see any Cs.\n\nAfter that I was fighting back tears throughout the whole graduation. I felt physically sick and considered leaving halfway through and going back to my apartment. I ended up sobbing in the car on the way home and telling him what grandma said. He is aware on my parents' stance on grades and how it affects me. \n\nThat night, I skipped his graduation dinner because I was crying and still shaken. I didn't want to see Grandma again. His mom was furious and said she never wanted to see me again until BF explained the situation. His dad became sympathetic; mom swept it under the rug and pretended she never said what she said. I'm sure if anyone ever told Grandma about what she said, but I haven't seen any of them since then.\n\nHowever, this is still a frequent topic of discussion between me and my boyfriend. He thinks I'm the one who damaged the relationship between me and his parents and that I'm at fault and need a little more control over my emotions because the GPA question is a \"common one to ask to students.\" He also knows I have my first therapy appointment in August when I get back to our college town and we are both looking forward to it. I don't feel like I'm at fault since I have been deprived of the emotional regulation skills a therapist could provide and can't help that my parents were jerks, but I can also see his point.

I would strongly recommend therapy - a simple question about your GPA should not throw you into a traumatized state.

You really need to work on improving yourself honestly. The way you reacted to 1 question was over the top. I can understand the idea of tying self worth to grades and wanting to feel valued and validated by older adults around you. My parents instilled that in me. So I know. What I also know is that if you don\u2019t work on improving your mental health you will not form good and healthy relationships in future. \n\nLook at the current situation objectively. Grandma just asked you a question. A very annoying but common question. That made you sob inconsolably and lead you to miss your boyfriend\u2019s graduation dinner. Would you want to behave similarly in a professional set up too? In corporates, question about university ranking, GPA, etc come up. Will you be willing to miss an important meeting because someone asked you what your GPA is? \n\nYou need to apologize to your boyfriend and his parents. Acknowledge that your emotions got the better of you and then work on doing better in the future.\n\nEdit to Add: People saying get therapy and you saying you can\u2019t will not give you a free pass. I went to 3 therapists and all 3 were pretty bad. Didn\u2019t help me at all. But I would always listen to friends who encouraged me to be in touch with my feelings and make conscious efforts to regulate emotions. It took me 6-7 years and I like to think I am almost there. Therapy isn\u2019t a magic fix. You have to do the work.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your parents really messed you up on that issue and definitely getting some help to work through that will benefit you. \n\nBut ultimately you made a celebration for him about you when you couldn\u2019t even bring yourself to attend for him. \n\nIt is weird to just come out guns blazing with a GPA question. People are commenting that it\u2019s normal but who tries to make conversation with a student and just starts up \u201cso what\u2019s your GPA?\u201d instead of like what type of jobs are you planning to apply to in that field, what made you choose it, do you like the school, do you plan to continue to a graduate degree, do you play sports? It does come off a bit aggressive tbh. \n\nBut if you literally can\u2019t face someone at a dinner table for being a bit pushy about something that you do have bad experiences with, it\u2019s going to hold you back in life. \n\nImagine if the tables were turned and your bf skipped your graduation dinner because your grandma said his choice of major doesn\u2019t make good money or something and it was a trigger for him. How would you feel?", "YTA\n\nThe grandma had no idea about what happened to you, so her bringing it up wasn\u2019t in any way a dig at you. It honestly seems as you were projecting your problems into the situation and I understand you haven\u2019t gone to therapy but you can still talk to other people about issues your having. Also you not having therapy help isn\u2019t an excuse for being rude and pushing people away ESPECIALLY on the day your bf graduated. It was a day for him to be celebrated for his hard work and your problems did get in the way of him enjoying himself with you so yeah.", "[deleted]", "Your high school GPA has nothing to do with the person that you will become.

I certainly hope you've apologized to his grandma--none of it is her fault.", "NAH.\n\nYou had an uncontrollable emotional reaction. That being said, it's understandable that your bf is frustrated that something so benign as a GPA question from a grandmother would cause that reaction. If you graduate next year, that means you've been going to college and had access to whatever resources they had to address this for a while now. Again, no AHs here, but I get his frustration. \n\nI think it would be great to figure out (with your therapist and bf) how to mend things with his family. If it's an apology, I'm sure your therapist can help you frame it in a way that's true to you", "YTA. I say this as someone whose anxiety had ruined many events before I finally got stable treatment. This was a school-centered event. It doesn't take a genius to foresee people wanting to talk about school. Surely there was a way to prepare yourself for this eventuality. A prepared answer about your GPA, maybe deflecting to \"3rd in my class!\" or something like that instead of giving the exact number if that number gives you anxiety. I think the GPA question is a little invasive, it's not necessarily grandma's business. But your reaction was WILDLY out of line. Traumatized, shaking, and sobbing for hours? Over 15 seconds worth of small talk? I'm glad you're getting therapy now, but it's probably too little too late regarding your relationship with your partner's family. They will always be walking on eggshells around you, terrified that any conversation will trigger you again. I lost a lot of friends due to my former panic attack reactions for exactly this reason, and I don't blame them. Get treatment, specify you need coping mechanisms for these situations, and don't push contact with your partner's family until they reach out and invite you again.", "seriously? grow up and i feel sorry for your bf who didnt get to have his partner in a once lifetime event because she act like a child", "NTA but glad to see in this feed that you are seeking counseling as your reaction was over the top and unwarranted by what was actually asked.

What's the conflict - that he thinks the current Cold War between you and his family is mostly because of your overreaction to a non-event and you think that you should get a full pass for that overreaction because you have issues you haven't been able to have professional therapy for yet?\n\nWith sympathy for your mental health situation, yes, YTA. You should have attended the dinner, and you do need to accept that you - not him or any member of his family - are the cause of the conflict, even if you did not do it intentionally. Grandma asked an awkward but predictable question in one of those awkward conversations you have with virtual strangers. His mom even stepped in with a really gracious save. Nobody said anything bad to you. You got really upset at the time and kept being upset way, way past the event. You are 20, not 12, and even without therapy you need to have been learning how to deal with this kind of thing. \n\nLook, I do have empathy with your childhood and your insecurity and grade triggers. My parents made us earn love through academic performance. If I topped my honors class with a 95% and the second highest grade was 80%, they'd say, \"good job, but what happened to that 5%?\" One of my dad's repeated sayings was, \"if you're not number 1, it doesn't matter where you are.\" So I think I do understand you more than many might. Parents can damage you and cause you to be certain unhealthy ways - even if they love you and were doing the best they could. But here's the thing, the older you get, the less that's an excuse. As you grow up, you have to take responsibility for the person you are. \n\nIt's great that you're getting therapy. It's great that you seem to have a very supportive bf. It's great that you clearly are intelligent and have made lots of good life choices. Might I suggest you see what reading and resources you can access yourself before your therapy starts in October?\n\nAnd might I suggest that you try to accept that in this case you were wrong (with some mitigating reasons), but it doesn't mean you're a terrible person, it doesn't mean you cannot change, and it doesn't mean the relationship isn't fixable.

Your parents are horrific (unfortunately in a not-too-uncommon way) and this is a sore spot for you.  At the same time, you're aware that Grandma asked a relatively common and innocent question.  It's one of those annoying things people often ask students -- what's your major, have you picked a career yet, when will you graduate, what's your GPA, do you have a summer job/post-graduation job lined up, are you seeing anyone, etc. etc. The worst that can reasonably be said of it is that it's not very creative and a little intrusive.\n\nTherapy can be a help, but it's not as widely available as it should be, and it's hardly the only source for learning emotional regulation.  \"I don't feel like I'm at fault since I have been deprived of the emotional regulation skills a therapist could provide\" is a weird thing for a clever adult to say.  By all means get therapy, but don't use the fact it's still in your future to prevent you from making good decisions now.", "Wtf. That triggered you? This isnt on granny.

It was a completely innocent question. Being upset at an old lady for that does make you look very bad.", "NAH, but you do come off as a bit self-absorbed. It is not unreasonable to expect you to be able to handle the situation better, and also not unreasonable for you to not want to go to dinner when you were that affected.

Let's break it down:\n\n1. Reacting to Grandma's question: When Grandma asked about your boyfriend's GPA and followed up by asking about yours, it's understandable that you were taken aback. Given your history with your parents and their intense focus on grades, it likely brought up negative emotions for you. It's normal to have an emotional reaction when confronted with a sensitive topic, especially one that has caused you distress in the past.\n\n2. Skipping the graduation dinner: Considering the emotional toll the situation took on you, it's understandable that you decided to skip the graduation dinner. You were feeling upset, shaken, and crying, and it's okay to prioritize your own well-being in such circumstances. Attending the dinner while in that state may have resulted in further discomfort and potential conflict. Your decision to take care of yourself by stepping back from the situation does not make you the asshole.\n\n3. Boyfriend's perspective: Your boyfriend's perspective may be influenced by his own experience and how he perceives the situation. He may not fully understand the emotional impact that your parents' behavior had on you, and he might think that the GPA question is a common one that shouldn't cause such distress. However, it's important for him to empathize with your feelings and consider your past experiences. It's positive that he is supportive of you seeking therapy and acknowledging that you could benefit from emotional regulation skills.\n\nOverall, it's crucial to communicate with your boyfriend about your feelings and the reasons behind your reactions. Help him understand the depth of the emotional impact your parents' behavior had on you and how it still affects you. By having open and honest conversations, you can work together to strengthen your relationship and foster understanding.", "NAH", "BF\u2019s poor decision has stirred this up.

But you dismiss the power you have over the direction of your life, yourself and your emotional responses when you refuse to take on the bagage you got given, and start handling/dealing/working to change the things that work against you living a good life. You do NOT need your parents involvement to free yourself of the burdens they handed you. Fuck them, dont need them validating what you have to do, what you need, the damage they did you. YOU DONT NEED THAT - infact you dont need anything from them. But you do need to own yourself. ALL of the ugly, all of the fears and the hurts. And then GET TO WORK!\n\nYou have to work on your triggers. Even when you feel something intensely and strongly, it may not mean that the person triggering you was malicious, or owes you an apology.

Adulting is about dealing with what you got left with in such a way it doesnt hinder or obstruct your ability to live a good life and maintain meaningful relations with other people.

It\u2019s not the ideal change I\u2019d wanna see, I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever really get it. But it was a start, and reminded me to always communicate when I need, and hope for the best. \n\nIf someone can\u2019t sympathize, understand me. Give me room to heal and grow. Fuck off. If I\u2019m doing my part to communicate, to try to change, that\u2019s enough for me. \n\nOP does need to work on it but the guilting from the bf over ruining the relationship with the parents needs to stop. It\u2019s not helpful or true. Nothing is ruined. Move on and focus on your health, and try again next time. If they\u2019re too ignorant to understand some people deal with mental health issues that take precedence, oh well. NTA be well\n\nOh and don\u2019t give your family any info about your therapy. That\u2019s not their business. Set some boundaries.

Parents who start out letting kids make low key decisions, and then build up to more important ones as the kids get older, get young adults who can get out into the world and make decisions for themselves.", "Often times you can get therapy at school for free. I had a great therapist at my university. It\u2019s excellent for people like OP. Their parents have no way of knowing (doesn\u2019t show up on insurance since it\u2019s free) and can\u2019t interfere.", "Fortunately this is not the case in Australia.

Full stop.", "Because heaven forbid the author get paid.", "No, it\u2019s not as easy to access as reddit would have you believe. I will personally still advocate for therapy for everyone though, even low cost options, simply to erase the stigma. \n\nMy husband works a job with a high suicide rate and while our insurance covers therapy the stigma around mental health and therapy mean many won\u2019t take the help they need.", "Unless you\u2019re insured, it is very expensive.\n\nGiven OP is 20 and in the US, she is most likely still on her parents insurance since parents can carry their child until they are 26.\n\nSo her parents would have access to all of her claims and benefits against the policy she\u2019s a dependent on.  And there would still be a copay for the appointments so OP would have to cover the copay themselves because presumably the parents would refuse to pay it since they seem to object to therapy.\n\nUS healthcare is unnecessarily expensive, restrictive, and complicated.  And mental healthcare is sadly no exception.\n\nI have semi-decent insurance so I pay $25/session copay for my therapy.  But when I had to go every two weeks, that does add up over time.\n\nThere are other options, but whether or not it\u2019s honestly affordable comes down to insurance and if you honestly have spare money to throw at mental healthcare vs rest of living", "8mo wait for me plus only seeing a trained mental health councilor. MHCs are great, but they can't diagnose officially nor prescribe/talk about medication where I'm at. This is more maintenance care, but they are using it as diagnostic/full care.\n\nOh, and my co-pays are $100 each visit", "2 year waiting list at the last place I worked (in mental health)", "For the most part no, however there are many different types of programs and nonprofits that can help/offer low cost services or on a sliding scale. For instance many people have pointed out that a lot of universities offer free counseling. I used to volunteer at a nonprofit outpatient behavioral health clinic. They offered counseling/therapy and psychiatric treatment for as low as $3 a visit and if you couldn't pay that it was fine. The max you'd pay for meds was $10. So it was quite affordable. \n\nThe issue is some of these places can get very busy, they also don't always have the best people working there. It's not always true though. The place I was at had some really amazing psychologists. I actually ended up getting off anxiety meds completely because of one of them. It just really depends, it's certainly possible though to find a good therapist that's affordable.", "How do you know she was even comparing? She just asked a question and OP gave an answer.", "> Irks me a bit too that she keeps pointing out her bf got a 4.0 in an easier major -- it's still tough to get a 4.0, why be defensive over it instead of just proud.\n\nSpeaks to a level of defensiveness on the subject.

I'm sure there are people in that major who would love a perfect GPA, and would be hurt by OP's diminishment of it.", "Faux Pas, r/boneappletea", "Not wanting to be rude or anything, the phrase is 'faux pas', it's a french phase meaning false step.", "Foe par \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I did not say she wasn't the asshole.", "Same. Unless OP has left out some significant body language/facial expression/etc, grandma didn\u2019t say anything apart from the initial question. I\u2019m assuming it HAS been left out by bf\u2019s mom apparently jumping in to make OP feel better, mom was obviously reacting to something. BUT; that something could have been OP\u2019s non-verbal communication rather than grandma\u2019s. \n\nI do agree with a soft YTA though. From bf\u2019s family\u2019s point of view, they didn\u2019t have any of the context so it was an extreme overreaction and skipping dinner then just looked unsupportive of bf when the event was about him. Whatever explanation OP feels comfortable with as well as an apology to bf and family would probably be the best course, as well as that therapy everyone\u2019s mentioning.", "I think if such a simple question sends you into this state, her problems go way beyond strict parents. Is she just going to have a mental breakdown every time someone talks about grades? I sympathize strongly with how she was treated but you gotta have thicker skin than that", "Snipping your own finger is surprisingly difficult and painful.", "Weird. I couldn\u2019t wait to get away from my toxic family first chance I got.

Absolutely, but still out of reach for many, especially with inflation", "I'm glad I'm in Brazil, here you can have free access to a psychologist all year long. You can also pay for one, but in SUS it's for free", "And in many places therapists are hard to find. I lived in an area with a huge healthcare company based right there, hospital, doctors offices, everything localized & available to everyone with that insurer\u2026until my stepson needed a therapist. It took forever to get one & they were booked out months.", "they do not have access to the actual health records & if desired, she can pay the co-pay a therefore no cost to the parents.

Had to wing it.", "Okay?... So you were literally just being pedantic, then.", "I don't disagree but we don't know how many times this has happened, if she was aware of how much her trauma affected her until now etc. So without knowing those, I can't call anyone an AH here. Therapy will hopefully help her with that response.", "Eh, when a toxic dynamic and abuse has essentially been normalized your whole life, it can take some time to recognize. I was in my late 20s before I realized that my mom giving me a black eye at 13 wasn\u2019t the funny story she\u2019d always made it out to be.

OP is already working towards healing, what more do you want, exactly?", "I mean OP removed herself from the situation, sometimes that\u2019s literally the best we can do. She didn\u2019t make a scene, or scream and yell at people. And she\u2019s going to be starting therapy to work on her emotional regulation skills, so she knows her reaction wasn\u2019t ideal and wants to do better and work on herself.\n\nSo, what exactly is your problem with her behavior here? \n\nNice job, participating in the trauma Olympics also. Might not be as healed as you think are if you\u2019re still doing that.", "If she\u2019s very lucky.  I had that!  Three free visits per year of mental health screening/counseling sessions.  I\u2019m sure it couldn\u2019t possibly take longer than that to fix her issues.", "It took my now wife showing me that the way my mother treated me wasn\u2019t normal. \n\nI had been helping raise my sisters and I was working at the age of 10 and giving her all my money and paying rent. \n\nWhen I quit a job so I could have a month off between Hugh school Grad and my summer job she blew up and took all my savings to pay the bills. As soon as I turned 18 she had me apply for credit cards and hand them over to her which were all shortly cancelled due to not paying them off. \n\nWas I dumb for thinking what was happening was not normal? Yes I should have known but we can get blinded by the words family and loyalty. \n\nWhen I met my wife she showed me how it wasn\u2019t normal. My mother tried to say all the right things to defend it but I\u2019m pretty sure she hates that someone opened my eyes since I moved out and stopped giving her all my pay cheques.

Clearly OP should have just put on a mask and been a robot through the dinner. Even though that could have triggered her further and potentially lead to her causing a scene.

Not everyone can see the signs as quickly as others. Especially when your sense of \u201cnormal\u201d is very skewed.
