{"id": 21640, "submission_id": "14ttxui", "title": "AITA for not attending my boyfriend's graduation dinner and how I reacted when his grandma asked my GPA?", "selftext": "My (20F) boyfriend (20M) of 1.5 years graduated college in May with a 4.0 GPA with an objectively easier degree (his words). I'm an engineering major who graduates next May (2024).\n\nI attended graduation with his parents and grandma. I had met his parents several times before and Grandma for the first time the night before. Before the ceremony started there was some time for us to talk, when the conversation turned towards academia. Grandma asked me \"What was BF's GPA?\" and I answered \"4.0.\" Then Grandma asked, \"What's *your* GPA?\" I was taken aback, and answered mine (3.538). There was another very awkward pause. His mom (same major as me) then swooped in and said \"that's good! I graduated with a 3.3 or something.\"\n\nWhat Grandma did not know is that my crazy parents equated my worth as a person with my high school GPA. I was yelled at if I brought a grade home less than an A, and they once asked me to get my \"A-\" grades up to \"A.\" I took dual enrollment classes at the same institution that one parent of mine is a professor at; that parent emailed their colleagues to check up on me. Because I was a minor (16/17) at that time, parent was legally allowed to access my grades. An AP English teacher gave me a B as my semester grade in junior year and my parents took my report card, yelled at me, and immediately went to the principal. They pulled out my old essays when talking to the principal as to why I deserved an A and tried to get the teacher fired, but the principal gave me an A since I passed the AP exam. Everyone was happy, so we moved on with life. They have since lessened up a bit, but don't want to see any Cs.\n\nAfter that I was fighting back tears throughout the whole graduation. I felt physically sick and considered leaving halfway through and going back to my apartment. I ended up sobbing in the car on the way home and telling him what grandma said. He is aware on my parents' stance on grades and how it affects me. \n\nThat night, I skipped his graduation dinner because I was crying and still shaken. I didn't want to see Grandma again. His mom was furious and said she never wanted to see me again until BF explained the situation. His dad became sympathetic; mom swept it under the rug and pretended she never said what she said. I'm sure if anyone ever told Grandma about what she said, but I haven't seen any of them since then.\n\nHowever, this is still a frequent topic of discussion between me and my boyfriend. He thinks I'm the one who damaged the relationship between me and his parents and that I'm at fault and need a little more control over my emotions because the GPA question is a \"common one to ask to students.\" He also knows I have my first therapy appointment in August when I get back to our college town and we are both looking forward to it. I don't feel like I'm at fault since I have been deprived of the emotional regulation skills a therapist could provide and can't help that my parents were jerks, but I can also see his point.

I would strongly recommend therapy - a simple question about your GPA should not throw you into a traumatized state.

You really need to work on improving yourself honestly. The way you reacted to 1 question was over the top. I can understand the idea of tying self worth to grades and wanting to feel valued and validated by older adults around you. My parents instilled that in me. So I know. What I also know is that if you don\u2019t work on improving your mental health you will not form good and healthy relationships in future. \n\nLook at the current situation objectively. Grandma just asked you a question. A very annoying but common question. That made you sob inconsolably and lead you to miss your boyfriend\u2019s graduation dinner. Would you want to behave similarly in a professional set up too? In corporates, question about university ranking, GPA, etc come up. Will you be willing to miss an important meeting because someone asked you what your GPA is? \n\nYou need to apologize to your boyfriend and his parents. Acknowledge that your emotions got the better of you and then work on doing better in the future.\n\nEdit to Add: People saying get therapy and you saying you can\u2019t will not give you a free pass. I went to 3 therapists and all 3 were pretty bad. Didn\u2019t help me at all. But I would always listen to friends who encouraged me to be in touch with my feelings and make conscious efforts to regulate emotions. It took me 6-7 years and I like to think I am almost there. Therapy isn\u2019t a magic fix. You have to do the work.", "YTA\n\nIt sounds like your parents really messed you up on that issue and definitely getting some help to work through that will benefit you. \n\nBut ultimately you made a celebration for him about you when you couldn\u2019t even bring yourself to attend for him. \n\nIt is weird to just come out guns blazing with a GPA question. People are commenting that it\u2019s normal but who tries to make conversation with a student and just starts up \u201cso what\u2019s your GPA?\u201d instead of like what type of jobs are you planning to apply to in that field, what made you choose it, do you like the school, do you plan to continue to a graduate degree, do you play sports? It does come off a bit aggressive tbh. \n\nBut if you literally can\u2019t face someone at a dinner table for being a bit pushy about something that you do have bad experiences with, it\u2019s going to hold you back in life. \n\nImagine if the tables were turned and your bf skipped your graduation dinner because your grandma said his choice of major doesn\u2019t make good money or something and it was a trigger for him. How would you feel?", "YTA\n\nThe grandma had no idea about what happened to you, so her bringing it up wasn\u2019t in any way a dig at you. It honestly seems as you were projecting your problems into the situation and I understand you haven\u2019t gone to therapy but you can still talk to other people about issues your having. Also you not having therapy help isn\u2019t an excuse for being rude and pushing people away ESPECIALLY on the day your bf graduated. It was a day for him to be celebrated for his hard work and your problems did get in the way of him enjoying himself with you so yeah.", "[deleted]", "Your high school GPA has nothing to do with the person that you will become.

I certainly hope you've apologized to his grandma--none of it is her fault.", "NAH.\n\nYou had an uncontrollable emotional reaction. That being said, it's understandable that your bf is frustrated that something so benign as a GPA question from a grandmother would cause that reaction. If you graduate next year, that means you've been going to college and had access to whatever resources they had to address this for a while now. Again, no AHs here, but I get his frustration. \n\nI think it would be great to figure out (with your therapist and bf) how to mend things with his family. If it's an apology, I'm sure your therapist can help you frame it in a way that's true to you", "YTA. I say this as someone whose anxiety had ruined many events before I finally got stable treatment. This was a school-centered event. It doesn't take a genius to foresee people wanting to talk about school. Surely there was a way to prepare yourself for this eventuality. A prepared answer about your GPA, maybe deflecting to \"3rd in my class!\" or something like that instead of giving the exact number if that number gives you anxiety. I think the GPA question is a little invasive, it's not necessarily grandma's business. But your reaction was WILDLY out of line. Traumatized, shaking, and sobbing for hours? Over 15 seconds worth of small talk? I'm glad you're getting therapy now, but it's probably too little too late regarding your relationship with your partner's family. They will always be walking on eggshells around you, terrified that any conversation will trigger you again. I lost a lot of friends due to my former panic attack reactions for exactly this reason, and I don't blame them. Get treatment, specify you need coping mechanisms for these situations, and don't push contact with your partner's family until they reach out and invite you again.", "seriously? grow up and i feel sorry for your bf who didnt get to have his partner in a once lifetime event because she act like a child", "NTA but glad to see in this feed that you are seeking counseling as your reaction was over the top and unwarranted by what was actually asked.

What's the conflict - that he thinks the current Cold War between you and his family is mostly because of your overreaction to a non-event and you think that you should get a full pass for that overreaction because you have issues you haven't been able to have professional therapy for yet?\n\nWith sympathy for your mental health situation, yes, YTA. You should have attended the dinner, and you do need to accept that you - not him or any member of his family - are the cause of the conflict, even if you did not do it intentionally. Grandma asked an awkward but predictable question in one of those awkward conversations you have with virtual strangers. His mom even stepped in with a really gracious save. Nobody said anything bad to you. You got really upset at the time and kept being upset way, way past the event. You are 20, not 12, and even without therapy you need to have been learning how to deal with this kind of thing. \n\nLook, I do have empathy with your childhood and your insecurity and grade triggers. My parents made us earn love through academic performance. If I topped my honors class with a 95% and the second highest grade was 80%, they'd say, \"good job, but what happened to that 5%?\" One of my dad's repeated sayings was, \"if you're not number 1, it doesn't matter where you are.\" So I think I do understand you more than many might. Parents can damage you and cause you to be certain unhealthy ways - even if they love you and were doing the best they could. But here's the thing, the older you get, the less that's an excuse. As you grow up, you have to take responsibility for the person you are. \n\nIt's great that you're getting therapy. It's great that you seem to have a very supportive bf. It's great that you clearly are intelligent and have made lots of good life choices. Might I suggest you see what reading and resources you can access yourself before your therapy starts in October?\n\nAnd might I suggest that you try to accept that in this case you were wrong (with some mitigating reasons), but it doesn't mean you're a terrible person, it doesn't mean you cannot change, and it doesn't mean the relationship isn't fixable.

Your parents are horrific (unfortunately in a not-too-uncommon way) and this is a sore spot for you.  At the same time, you're aware that Grandma asked a relatively common and innocent question.  It's one of those annoying things people often ask students -- what's your major, have you picked a career yet, when will you graduate, what's your GPA, do you have a summer job/post-graduation job lined up, are you seeing anyone, etc. etc. The worst that can reasonably be said of it is that it's not very creative and slightly intrusive.\n\nTherapy can be a help, but it's not as widely available as it should be, and it's hardly the only source for learning emotional regulation.  \"I don't feel like I'm at fault since I have been deprived of the emotional regulation skills a therapist could provide\" is a weird thing for a clever adult to say.  By all means get therapy, but don't use the fact it's still in your future to prevent you from making good decisions now.", "Wtf. That triggered you? This isnt on granny.

It was a completely innocent question. Being upset at an old lady for that does make you look very bad.", "NAH, but you do come off as a bit self-absorbed. It is not unreasonable to expect you to be able to handle the situation better, and also not unreasonable for you to not want to go to dinner when you were that affected. I also understand that your bfs parents are hurt on their sons behalf, as they likely see this as a major accomplishment of his that you deprioritised based on an off-handed comment (even though I understand that it hurt quite a lot based on your history, that might not be so easy without hearing the story from you. As I understand it, it triggered memories, but grandma didn\u2019t actually say anything about your gpa not being good enough did she?). \n\nI think it would be wise for you to take initiative to meet up with your boyfriends parents and start to repair the relationships. I also if wonder if your bf might be more hurt with you skipping the dinner than he has told you, as the subject keeps coming up? \n\nLastly, I think it is worthwhile for you to think about why you felt the need to point out that your boyfriends degree is objectively easier. Even though he might use those words, it is not really relevant here and you shouldn\u2019t need to point it out. I wonder if that is also related to your previous experience and the maladaptive behaviour of your parents, and perhaps you should be vary about not re-enacting that in your relationship.", "You aren't an AH, but an apology and explanation to his parents may help. Ask your therapist about EMDR therapy to separate the event from the emotion. So, if someone brings up a trigger point like GPA, you won't panic again. You also may want to look into \"tapping,\" which is effective in shutting down anxiety. Good luck.", "NTA - But. I would still apologize and explain that you didn\u2019t want to ruin your boyfriend\u2019s celebration by being in a bad mental place.

Plus we also have a problem of suicide in university.", "NTA, but your BF is for thinking & saying that it's your fault for ruining any relationship with his family because he is the one that hasn't yet explained it to all of them adequately. And even if he has, you still have no control over how other people react given that information. Also, he doesn't sound like a very compassionate person.\n\nWhile I understand that he wanted you (and by extension, himself) to make a good impression to his family, things happen that are sometimes out of our control.\n\nHe's not going to be easy to live with if he doesn't understand that and \"go with the flow\" when needed. He needs to reevaluate his priorities.\n\nNext time reply that you prefer not to give your GPA for personal reasons, but simply that it's high (enough to graduate).

Without therapy and the skills it will give you, your reaction is understandable. Not normal, but you know that. \n\nHowever, not seeing his parents becuase of this is potentially an AH move. Apologise for your outburst (they know the reason so no need to open that up), and maybe arrange to have a meeting in a neutral space to get the uncomfy meeting out of the way.\n\nTherapy will be hard, but good on you for knowing and taking that option. Good luck.\n\nAlso, bf seems very supportive and kind, his parents can't be that bad if he is the result of their parenting. Him mum even chimed in that it was a good grade. They are good people by the sounds of it so try to rebuild that relationship.", "nta for your feelings\n\nI don't think I every had a stranger ask my GPA--they have ask what I majored in but not grade point average.

That is NOT normal(to me anyway)", "NTA, but I don't think the Grandma asked it out of malice, but people deal with trauma with differently and if you needed to be away from people after that that's completely understandable.\n\nIf your bfs parents are being cold towards you because of it they're totally TA, and your bf kinda is for blaming you for how they reacted. \n\nDefinitely a good idea to get therapy though, just for your own mental health.", "NTA and your boyfriend sucks because he knows your trama and instead of shutting that shit down he got mad at you. It's wildly inappropriate for Redditors to be calling you the one wrong. But you do need therapy for this issue. Call your dude out and tell him to stop being the butthead. Also tell him if you guys continue that HE needs to learn when to be a buffer with his family. When you decide a person is your person, it's your job to run interference with your family.", "OP, what you had was a trigger moment. This is when something that was bad in your younger years is brought forward based on a statement, a smell, an activity, etc.  You were reacting to a simple question that made you remember when you were judged by your parents. I am not defending grandma but it is typical to ask gpa information. People are curious and ask some of the stupidest questions.  But how they all reacted to you was not appropriate. \n\nI am glad you are going to counseling in the fall.  This will give you an opportunity to explore your feelings of worth.  My advice is that you talk with his family and explain why you reacted the way you did. Maybe they can understand and sympathize.", "YTA, don\u2019t punish her through someone you claim to love. \n\nUnless it\u2019s a civil or environmental engineering degree, it\u2019s probably harder than his too. Which is also an AH thing to say to him haha.", "YTA. His parents don't know your history. You made his graduation about yourself when it was a celebration of your boyfriend. You should have still it though.\n\nYour trauma is not their responsibility. They shouldn't have to be punished for it", "NTA, although you probably need to toughen up a bit. \n\nThat said, this is possibly a cultural difference but asking someone you have just met about their grades seems phenomenally rude.

Now they will always think you\u2019re dramatic and the type of person who has beef with grandma is just not going to be anyone\u2019s favorite.

But you are in the wrong in this situation.", "NTA but it's obviously a massive trigger from a borderline abusive childhood experience (at least on this one topic) that you need to deal with. You can't have this strong reaction if someone asks an innocent question. We all have traumas and triggers and it appears you are aware of it, which is already hugely important. Now it's about dealing with it.\n\nI've had a school friend who had parents like yours. Her father yelling at the high school dean and teachers was well-known in our town. My friend, however, indeed didn't deserve better grades (whether she didn't have \"it\", didn't study hard enough or was blocked because of her parents' behavior is tough to say - probably a mix of all three). Every time her dad called the school, everyone caved and increased her grades (for some reason). The whole school knew. Despite this, she barely graduated and then massively failed at uni, flunking out within a year. She never quite found her footing in professional life (we are >40). I asked her 15 years later about the consequences of this, and she said it took a lot of therapy before she ultimately confronted her parents, who at least acknowledged they were wrong. But the damage had been done. \n\nDon't get to that point and deal with this properly, for your own sake.", "NAH,\nGrandma and bf did not know about your past.\nYou have problem with your emotional attachment to gpa, you need therapy. \n\nThe gpa question for your age group is the same as what do you do for a living for adults.
