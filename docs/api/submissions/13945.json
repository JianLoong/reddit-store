It\u2019s brutal, but I should be finished in December. I have five cousins on my dad\u2019s side. Most of them have non-health related careers, but Andy (32M) is a chiropractor and Kayla (26F) is a nurse practitioner.\n\nNow, my dad\u2019s family has had at least one or two doctors in every generation. My grandpa and his brother were both family medicine, my dad is a urologist, and one of my aunts is a pediatrician. When I was in high school and college, my grandparents used to talk about how I would carry on the tradition and be the first doctor in my generation of our family. My other cousins were very clear they weren\u2019t interested. \n\nLast weekend, we had an early Easter celebration/ egg hunt with my dad\u2019s side \u2014 some people are on call this coming weekend, so it made more sense to do it early. At the table, my grandma was asking about my residency and how happy they were to see me as the first doctor of my generation. Andy butted in and pointed out that he and Kayla are also \u201cdoctors.\u201d I was frankly annoyed and a little tipsy, so I told him that chiropractor and NP aren\u2019t the same thing as a physician, at all. Chiropractics is pseudoscience and can even be dangerous for patients. Nursing is a great career and I\u2019m proud of my cousin for getting her NP, but an NP is it\u2019s own distinct thing. Andy got pissy and called me privileged and arrogant. Kayla kind of took my side, but then said something about how NP school is just as challenging as medical school and that it\u2019s \u201conly devalued because nursing is a historically female career path.\u201d \n\nMy grandpa interjected to tell them both to take a seat, that they weren\u2019t doctors and shouldn\u2019t be claiming to be such. After lunch, Kayla pulled me aside and un-invited me to her private practice grand opening next month. She said she only wanted people who would cheer her on to attend, and she felt it was best if I skipped. I didn\u2019t really want to go anyway \u2014 I have very limited free time \u2014 so I said I respected that.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680578844, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12b7s90/aita_for_pointing_out_that_my_cousins_arent/", "score": 298, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's a con artist. Chiropractic is fake medicine and it is actively harmful to many people. At best, it causes them to delay real treatment until it gets worse. There's nothing respectable about being a chiropractor, and shutting him down like that is to everyone's benefit. He needs to find a real career. \n\nIt also surprises me how few people are aware that chiropractic is based in fantasy rather than evidence. \n\nTowards Kayla, you are TA. A nurse practitioner is a highly trained position with significant overlap in skills and responsibilities. Depending on where you're located and what kind of practice you intend to be in, the two roles **can** be interchangeable. (Not a given, of course.)\n\nIt's not a lesser career and shouldn't be treated as one. While it may be literally true that she's not a doctor, she's close enough that it's not worth quibbling over.

I'm convinced there's going to be much greater focus on preventative care in future, and a lot of that is being driven by nursing research.\n\nBut, nursing is not medicine, and nurse practitioners aren't doctors. Ultimately there's a point where nursing care stops and doctors take over.", "ESH \u2014 technically, you have grounds here, but to humiliate them in front of your grandparents is just asking for a rift between you guys.

Unless you have a really super close, joking relationship with the chiropractor and NP and can get into a friendly debate. It doesn't sound like that at all. But it's also not a big deal. If you are generally kind and respectful most of the time, it shouldn't be a problem - just a blip in family conversation and an opportunity to learn. \n\nAlso I've received some amazing care from nurse practitioners, who are different than nurses. They have provided incredibly thoughtful, informed, effective care. (For awhile I would only see them because they asked the most relevant questions while the doctors at the same practice did not.) You would do well for yourself and your patients to have humility and learn from your fellows.", "NTA.

Though in hindsight you could\u2019ve been a little more tactful with your words. After saying they were \u201cdoctors\u201d you could\u2019ve casually mentioned their fields.

Some states may allow this to happen but the discrepancy in learning and clinical hours is crazy. You can become an NP at Georgetown through a 2 year online program that doesn't even require a GRE. \n\nMed schools are not online, require way more clinical hours, and require a bachelors.

So he has a right to say he's a doctor, as long as he doesn't say he's a physician, which in this case doesn't sound like he did. \n\nI personally think it's a case of the family being tone deaf and only associating the word doctor with physicians and thus making the other Doctorate holders, also heavily involved in medicine, feel very undervalued. The family should have switched their tune to be proud and celebrate the fact that multiple kids are in medicine, instead of having this physician tunnel vision. We're a quarter century into the new millennium, after all.

I can see a guy snapping and saying, hey, we're doctors too, if you only value physicians, then use that word and don't undermine our accomplishments.
