It\u2019s brutal, but I should be finished in December. I have five cousins on my dad\u2019s side. Most of them have non-health related careers, but Andy (32M) is a chiropractor and Kayla (26F) is a nurse practitioner.\n\nNow, my dad\u2019s family has had at least one or two doctors in every generation. My grandpa and his brother were both family medicine, my dad is a urologist, and one of my aunts is a pediatrician. When I was in high school and college, my grandparents used to talk about how I would carry on the tradition and be the first doctor in my generation of our family. My other cousins were very clear they weren\u2019t interested. \n\nLast weekend, we had an early Easter celebration/ egg hunt with my dad\u2019s side \u2014 some people are on call this coming weekend, so it made more sense to do it early. At the table, my grandma was asking about my residency and how happy they were to see me as the first doctor of my generation. Andy butted in and pointed out that he and Kayla are also \u201cdoctors.\u201d I was frankly annoyed and a little tipsy, so I told him that chiropractor and NP aren\u2019t the same thing as a physician, at all. Chiropractics is pseudoscience and can even be dangerous for patients. Nursing is a great career and I\u2019m proud of my cousin for getting her NP, but an NP is it\u2019s own distinct thing. Andy got pissy and called me privileged and arrogant. Kayla kind of took my side, but then said something about how NP school is just as challenging as medical school and that it\u2019s \u201conly devalued because nursing is a historically female career path.\u201d \n\nMy grandpa interjected to tell them both to take a seat, that they weren\u2019t doctors and shouldn\u2019t be claiming to be such. After lunch, Kayla pulled me aside and un-invited me to her private practice grand opening next month. She said she only wanted people who would cheer her on to attend, and she felt it was best if I skipped. I didn\u2019t really want to go anyway \u2014 I have very limited free time \u2014 so I said I respected that.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680578844, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12b7s90/aita_for_pointing_out_that_my_cousins_arent/", "score": 1128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's a con artist. Chiropractic is fake medicine and it is actively harmful to many people. At best, it causes them to delay real treatment until it gets worse. There's nothing respectable about being a chiropractor, and shutting him down like that is to everyone's benefit. He needs to find a real career. \n\nIt also surprises me how few people are aware that chiropractic is based in fantasy rather than evidence. \n\nTowards Kayla, you are TA. A nurse practitioner is a highly trained position with significant overlap in skills and responsibilities. Depending on where you're located and what kind of practice you intend to be in, the two roles **can** be interchangeable. (Not a given, of course.)\n\nIt's not a lesser career and shouldn't be treated as one. While it may be literally true that she's not a doctor, she's close enough that it's not worth quibbling over.

I'm convinced there's going to be much greater focus on preventative care in future, and a lot of that is being driven by nursing research.\n\nBut, nursing is not medicine, and nurse practitioners aren't doctors. Ultimately there's a point where nursing care stops and doctors take over.", "ESH \u2014 technically, you have grounds here, but to humiliate them in front of your grandparents is just asking for a rift between you guys.

Love it.\n\nThe fact that Kayla uninvited you for not buying into her fantasy is hilarious. LOL.", "YTA - just let it go. It's not tactful. It doesn't make you look good. Unless you have a really super close, joking relationship with the chiropractor and NP and can get into a friendly debate. It doesn't sound like that at all. But it's also not a big deal. If you are generally kind and respectful most of the time, it shouldn't be a problem - just a blip in family conversation and an opportunity to learn. \n\nAlso I've received some amazing care from nurse practitioners, who are different than nurses. They have provided incredibly thoughtful, informed, effective care. (For awhile I would only see them because they asked the most relevant questions while the doctors at the same practice did not.) You would do well for yourself and your patients to have humility and learn from your fellows.", "NTA.

Though in hindsight you could\u2019ve been a little more tactful with your words. After saying they were \u201cdoctors\u201d you could\u2019ve casually mentioned their fields.

So there's that \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I think chirp gets a bad rep for it\u2019s past and basis on vertebral subluxations (which don\u2019t exist) but they have become much more evidence based in recent years and there is plenty of evidence that they can be as effective as PT", "Can confirm. My wife is an NP in AZ with her own practice without a MD over her.", "Yeah, in fact they were better. That's definitely what drove the whole thing. Cheaper and as/more effective, yes please! ~ insurance companies", "Yeah it\u2019s not quite the same thing with nurse practitioners (or physician practitioners who are similar in duties to a GP but are trained on the job like apprentices rather than going through medical school, and have limited salary but otherwise the same role and duties as a doctor - many are trained in nursing or pharmacy first) with the paramedics.\nWe have had prescribing paramedics for a long time here also but the nurse practitioners are allowed to prescribe even when there\u2019s no immediate risk to life (eg prescribing antibiotics for a chest infection not severe enough to require hospitalisation, or prescribing steroids in an asthma clinic).", "Actually we do have it, it is in the beginning but we do have it now in Germany as well. Just google for Advanced Practice Nurse.", "Nursing in Germany is pretty archaic though, so it doesn't really surprise me that NPs aren't a thing there", "Which is why I\u2019m specifically addressing the commenter above me calling them nurses. Did you read my comment at all?", "Yes.", "I don\u2019t agree. NPs can diagnose and give prescriptions. They can be a primary care provider. Yes they need oversight from a doctor and are significantly less educated. I\u2019m not denying that.", "It might be confusing to some, as in other countries, a chiropractic degree isn't a professional doctrate. For example, in Australia, you can be a chiropractor with a Bachelor of Science (Chiropractic) & Bachelor of Chiropractic. I understand the original post is referring to a situation in the USA, but I just thought I'd put that out there as potential clarification to anyone reading.\n\nEdit: To clarify in some countries a degree, bearing the title \"Doctor\" isn't considered a professional doctrate and doesn't qualify a person to use the title \"Doctor.\" Using Australia as an example again, a person who obtains a Juris Doctor (JD) or a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) or Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) isn't considered a \"Doctor\" and shouldn't use that title (unless they obtain it in some other fashion). This is because professional doctrates in Australia are reserved for research degrees. The exception is a Doctor of Medicine (MD), which, while not a professional doctrate and can't use the title \"Doctor\" in that respect, can say they are a Doctor as far as the common vernacular is concerned.", "Just did. Thanks! Didn't know about it before.", "But they are nurses. Nurse-Practitioner is still a type of nurse. It's not a lesser job but it is a different job - starting with a different educational pathway, and with different focuses and responsibilities.", "This post is breaking my brain.  Remarkably:\n\nNurses are nurses.\n\nNurse practitioners are nurse practitioners.  It is best they don't pretend they are doctors.\n\nChiropractics is pseudo-science and can be dangerous, and especially dangerous when they pretend they are doctors.\n\nDoctors, mindblowingly, are doctors.", "In the state of Idaho, they don't need oversight from a doctor.", "The most important thing any service provider can remember is the scope of their abilities and not try to exceed them. Most do but the rotten few who don\u2019t really wreck things", "Beautifully put. If these two want the kudos and accolades from the family patriarch, perhaps they should consider applying to Medical School, for a Degree in Medicine, not Nursing or Chiropractic Studies. It seems that other healthcare professionals expect the same accolades as an MD. If you have such little job satisfaction and pride in your profession, perhaps you really shouldn't be in healthcare.", "That\u2019s very concerning.", "Yikes!", "I concur"]}
