Since then, I have made some friends. Whenever I see them we usually have no problems. I am always happy to help out my friends whenever they ask. I have had friends ask me to see my notes and help them study, which I have had no problems with. However, I have one person in my class X (m). He is not really someone I consider to be a close friend in my classes, but eventually asked for my phone number because he saw that I was taking a lot of notes and asked me if I would share them. He seemed nice at first. \n\nOnce we were messaging everything took place over a few weeks. I let X know straight away that I would send over my notes when I was done. I sent him the notes for our classes where we had tests coming up. There was no problem. However, during the next couple weeks, he proceeded to constantly pester me for my notes despite me letting him know I had a lot to catch up on because I was more focused on studying for those first 3 tests we had. I am not one to do things at the last minute and our next tests weren\u2019t for another 2 weeks. At one point I was getting really annoyed because I kept having to reiterate the same things to him. I can\u2019t just get all my notes done in one day because I have a life outside of school and I also have to work. \n\nOn top of the constant pestering, I was having other issues with X making weird comments that had nothing to do with school, which is not why I gave him my phone number. For example, he kept asking me if I was on Tinder or if I use other dating sites, which I thought was weird. There was one instance where I was up late because I was doing work and he asked what I was doing up late and if I was up late because I was talking to my boyfriend. I proceeded to tell him I do not have a boyfriend and then he said he found that surprising and kept saying things along the lines of \u201cwhy don\u2019t you have a boyfriend?\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ll get a boyfriend when you least expect it\u201d which made me really uncomfortable. \n\nThe final straw was when he asked me about sending him the notes I\u2019ve been taking and I told him it was getting annoying. I then said that I think it would be better if he just took his own notes because everything is in our courses and textbooks anyways. I know I would send stuff over to my friends in my classes who ask, but X is not my friend and the things he has said to me that are not related to school have made me really uncomfortable. I told him how I felt uncomfortable about everything and then I blocked his number, but part of me feels like an AH because I am helping out my friends and not him. I feel bad for backing out.

Why do you think you owe him anything? NTA but start developing a backbone here.", "Ok so.. you came here for honesty right? Put your big girl pants on and tell dude to F off. Take your own notes AH\u2026 you aren\u2019t helping him by giving him notes you\u2019re hurting him AND he\u2019s not your friend. It\u2019s uncomfortable telling people to F off but part of becoming and adult is having those difficult conversations", "NTA. If you feel creepy vibes from someone,  TRUST THAT INSTINCT. Helping someone once because they missed a class is one thing, this person seemed to want a personal PA. \nKeep that number blocked.", "NTA- you are allowed to block ppl/not help them if at any point you no longer want to do so.", "NTA: Seems like he's just attempting to take advantage of the situation, for his own interest in you.. not the notes", "Definitely NTA. He is becoming too reliant on you and taking advantage of your kindness. You\u2019ve tried to set the boundaries and he chose not to respect them. I also think he either has a crush on you or wants you to think he has a crush on you in order to get your notes. This is graduate school, not high school\u2026it\u2019s time for him to step up to the pressure of his courses. Keep blocking his number and if he brings it up to you, I\u2019d tell him that you\u2019re too busy to help him\u2026sorry, not sorry.", "NTA\n\nAt first it read like he's just taking advantage of you: not doing his own work and mooching off your notes. But by the end, it read like he's using the whole 'give me notes' thing to get with you on top of that.", "NTA. Sounds like he was taking advantage of you and since you mentioned that you\u2019re not exactly friends plus he didn\u2019t hire you to take notes for him, you don\u2019t owe him anything. It can be uncomfortable to say no but if it\u2019s making you uncomfortable and stressing you unnecessarily, you need to set your boundaries.", "NTA.  A friend and acquaintance are two different things, and based on your description of him, he's definitely not a friend.  It seems like he was using your notes as way to ask you out or for some other sexual interest.  Blocking him was the right thing to do if he made you feel uncomfortable.", "NTA he needs to take his own notes. He\u2019s not out sick he\u2019s just lazy.", "He was using you. Step away.", "NTA. He's overstepping social boundaries by pestering you for class notes and trying to ask for a date in the creepiest way.\n\nGood on you for blocking him. If he asks about notes, tell him you no longer can share your notes with him. Don't bother to justify why.\n\nIf he asks about your personal life, tell him \"I want to keep our conversations about school. I don't like talking about my dating life.\" Again, no need to justify why.\n\nIf he continues with this behavior, you'll need to escalate to your grad program.", "NTA - You did the right thing in blocking him.  He is way to obsessive towards you at this point.  Tell him you are no longer his note taker so do his own notes and you want to be left alone, period.  If he persists take to the school administrator or your teacher.  Hopefully you won't have to go so far as getting a RO.", "NTA\nConsent can change at any time. Consent to something at one time does not create an obligation to \"extend\" that consent to other times. Consent to an activity (sharing notes) does not \"automatically\" imply consent to other activities (repeated demands for attn, \"flirting\").\n\nStart thinking about healthy boundaries, consent, and defending your healthy boundaries when they're violated. Things got as exhausting and uncomfortable as they did because you weren't clear in your own mind where your boundaries should be. Pay attention in situations where you feel uncomfortable. It's likely a place where you need a healthier boundary. \n\nIn this case, you were willing to share class notes when you were ready. He pushed boundaries through attention seeking by texting repeatedly and too often. He pushed past the \"sharing notes\" boundary by starting the dating questions conversation. In both cases, you were caught off guard. Your automatic response is compliance- responding to those demands for your attention and information beyond the bounds of \"I'll share my notes when they're ready.\" Learn from this. Learn to recognize a boundary intrusion and how to rebuff it.\n\n\"I'll send notes when ready.\" Once or twice. Then, \"I am uncomfortable being rushed.\" Finally \"This isn't working for me.\" and you stop trying to do that thing.\n\n\"Focused only on doing well in this class.\" Followed by \"Please stick to class.\" Then \"I offered notes. This is becoming uncomfortable. Please stop personal questions.\" And, finally, \"This isn't working for me.\" and ending the interactions.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Asking about the notes is just an excuse to text you. Asking about the boyfriend and dating apps was him trying to figure out if you were available. NTA though. You don't owe him anything. Don't feel guilty for blocking him.", "I was honestly just trying to be nice, but yeah that backfired. If anything else happens then I will still be upfront about how I feel and tell him to not speak to me anymore.", "I already did say this, I just felt bad because I felt like I was backing out of something. His number is staying blocked and if he says anything in person I\u2019m definitely going to tell him that I don\u2019t want to speak to him anymore.", "At what point in this interaction does he try to be nice? He milks you for your efforts with zero appreciation or reciprication while also violating personal boundaries. Might be worth reflecting on why you still feel some need to please someone like this.", "You are backing out of something, and that's ok. Think of it this way. If someone wants to arbitrarily switch up an agreement without the other party agreeing then the other party has a right to back out. You agreed to loan him notes. That was why you gave him your phone number. He switched up the agreement when he started flirting (badly, too) You don't consent to the new scope of the agreement so you're backing out. There is nothing to feel bad about. And honestly, I think he was being dishonest about his intentions when he asked for your phone number. The notes are just a subterfuge to keep you on the line until he can reel you in.", "NTA\n\nLazy and creepy. Ew.\nGood call on the block.", "NTA. I assume he can take notes. This has nothing to do with notes. He is a pain in the ass.", "NTA. You asked him to stop and he wouldn't, so you removed his access to you outside of school. He was also  trying to hit on you, but you're obviously not interested.", "NTA. \n\nYou were being really generous with your time and efforts, and he singlehandedly ruined it for himself even with multiple warnings.", "An agreement to help is not a binding contract. Even if he wasn't trying to see how far he could push up, you would have every right to decide you were done. \n\nNTA, and watch your back, people like that can escalate.", "NTA", "NTA  He's a weirdo and you did the right thing.", "Be nice to nice people, not lazy assholes who want you to do his school work and suck his dick. You made the right move by blocking, do it more often.", "Stop trying to be nice at the expense of yourself or the world will chew you up and spit you out.", "Being nice doesnt mean doing anything for anyone.", "Have you seen him since you blocked him? I think you might need to watch your back for a bit. Same behavior came from multiple stalkers in my life.\n\nTake care", "Backing out of something you never should have been asked.. at least not more than once.", "No I haven\u2019t yet, but I have class tomorrow so I hope he doesn\u2019t approach me. Thank you!", "I didn\u2019t even think of it this way so that\u2019s why I felt wrong in a way, but this is definitely reassuring!", "To add on to this... Long term relationships with friends or family are not healthy when they're transactional. By that I mean a relationship where every interaction is based on the idea that you're going to get something out of it. You don't want your sibling or your significant other to be focused on what they're going to get in return for doing something nice for you. \n\nThat's okay, but by and large our other interactions with people *are* transactional and that is relatively healthy. Outside of showing basic kindness like holding the door for someone carrying a bunch of books, or offering someone a dollar or two when they come up short at the cash register having transactional relationships makes sense. You started off by showing some basic, but generous kindness to this person. What is really the effort in sharing your notes with someone else? You add one more person onto an email that's already going out to a couple people? No big deal... \n\nBut once that person starts asking for more, it's not longer a simple but generous kindness. They're no longer simply asking for the notes that you were going to make at your own pace and share with other people anyways. They're asking you to do things outside of your normal schedule, they're adding stress into your life by pestering you for this. \n\nBut what are you getting out of this relationship? From the sounds of it, just off putting comments that make your life even more stressful. \n\nThat's not the basis for a healthy friendship. If this guy was doing basically anything for these notes like taking notes in a different class and sharing them with you, or if you were charging people for the notes, it would be a different story. But you were simply providing the notes free of charge out of the kindness of your heart and this person abused that. \n\nYou're under no moral obligation to do anything for this guy. You're under no moral obligation to keep communicating with this person just because they're in your class. This isn't some ethical \"Social contract\" type situation where you need to question what your duty is to your fellow human. It's pretty cut and dry. This guy wants your notes so he doesn't have to make his own. He wants you to give them to him for free whenever he wants them (not when is convenient for you), and he wants to hit on you while he nags you for something you didn't actually promise him. And in return, he is offering you absolutely nothing. That's not a friendship, that's not a relationship, that's not an acquaintance, that's someone trying to take advantage of you.", "You're a woman, in today's world, you have to be careful.", "Your welcome. I hope you read ADubs62 comment. It's the best one on this post and I think it will offer way more validation than my comment, about why you're absolutely justified to wash your hands of this guy."]}
