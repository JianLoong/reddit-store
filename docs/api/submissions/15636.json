There's no rule that states you must have xcm clearance between your knees and the seat in front.

It makes my tray table basically useless, same with my screen.", "Light YTA especially because you said that you've caused this issue to people before. \n\nI know you can't change your height but we pressure fat people to buy 2 seats to not inconvenience those around them so it should be reasonable to expect you to pay for leg room to not inconvenience the people around you.

The spaces are ridiculous without someone encroaching on the tiny space you've paid for.", "YTA.  You know the issue occurs. Seats are made to recline and people are allowed to recline them, otherwise why have the recline feature at all? People might have been travelling for ten or fifteen hours already and need to sleep.

You did fine.", "NTA. Also I\u2019m obviously in the minority here but I agree with you that reclining is inconsiderate. Everyone may have a right to do it, but does that make it right? I personally never recline because I know I dislike it when the seat in front of me has been pushed even closer to me. I treat others how I wish to be treated.

But I do highly recommend you search for seats with more legspace when you fly more than 3 hours. People like to nap. The situation also fully depends on whether you have a day- or night flight in my opinion.   \n\n\nAs someone who unfortunately has to fly often for work, usually short flights, I like to keep my seat up to not be inconsiderate to others. Unless I want to nap (think early morning flight, lots of meetings later that I prefer not to do in a brain-fog).  \nI've flown twice for a long flight (10+ hours) with sort of being the woman who sat in front of you. The first time the person behind me was just very tall (almost 2meters) and I couldn't recline without hurting his knees. I noticed, looked behind me a bit annoyed as I had hoped to catch some sleep but he explained he couldn't help it. I understood and didn't try to recline anymore. It was a dayflight, so I could read or just look outside (never realised how incredibly big the Sahara desert is until I flew over it). Again: it was a dayflight and he coulnd't help his height as much as I can't help mine, which is why I didn't mind. If this was your situation, I strongly vote NTA.  \n\n\nIt changes if your situation was a bit like the second interaction with a tall person I had. The second time I flew through the night and I had run out of vacation days so I had to work the next morning (literally had to log in 2 hours after getting out of the plane, yes it was very tight). The person behind me did everything in their power to prevent me from reclining. Pushing my seat so it was difficult to recline, putting their feet next to the little movie-screen and kicking and pushing there. When I came back from the bathroom they had taken it upon themselves to move my seat back into the upright position. The plane was fully booked, the flight attendants couldn't help me or him. He was a tall man, but I checked and he had just a bit of space between my seat reclined and his knees (not much though, I will admit that). He called me \"extremely selfish and entitled\" for wanting to recline my seat (I was wearing a sleep mask, headphones, and took a hefty dose of melatonin so it was very clear what my intentions were). He was an extreme a-hole and I even heard him complaing (loudly) to the person next to him that \"normally the airline upgrades him for free when he checked in and they saw he was fairly tall\". So he hadn't bought a seat with extra leg space because he wanted that upgrade for free, all the while he knew this would be a potential problem! Again, he had some space left, but not much. Let's say if he put a bigger snack in the little bag in front of him that would've touched his knees.  \nLet's say I had one hell of a night and flight, had multiple stab-y thoughts, and had an extremely hard time staying awake the next day during meetings.", "YTA.

Because you had zero problems.", "Hilarious that some people on here will say a fat person needs two seats and then give a tall person a pass for not getting a seat with extra leg room. \n\nKind of an AH.

Half the time a 13 inch laptop barely fits in a basic economy seat nowadays. \n\nI\u2019d also much rather have the person in the window and middle recline and sleep. Literally my last international flight, computer McGee middle seat asked me to get up 4 times in a sub 7 hour flight. I sit in the aisle so I can get up and not once did he go while I was already up.\n\nPersonally I\u2019ve never had an issue with someone reclining the seats. They barely recline anymore anyway. Even before they recline I\u2019m to tall to sleep leaning forward on the tray table. Like yeah it\u2019s annoying there seat is closer but I\u2019ve literally never seen a reclined seat touch the chest of a person sitting back in their own seat.\n\nI may not be overly tall, still above average, but I do have broad shoulders and have been fairly heavy at points in my life. Never once has a reclined seat touched me in my seat. Kept me from getting up, or stopped me from using my tray table. It does make using a laptop impossible, but like news flash it\u2019s impossible to use a laptop on a basic economy seat without being an asshole to anyone you share an armrest with as you almost certainly got to elbow an inch over the arm rest to use it. So  computer users are basically doing a constant moving elbow knead massage to the person next to you: how blissful.\n\nMy theory based on personal experience is there is a ton of overlap in the ven-diagram of no recline people and economy laptop users. In large part because that\u2019s what reclining really makes impossible. Thus for the people in the overlap, the sense of superiority is ridiculous. I mention the computer because I\u2019ve frequently been by a member of team no recline that only hates it because then they can\u2019t get out their laptop to elbow other people for however many hours. \n\nIf you need to work on a flight, that\u2019s literally the purpose of business class. If you hate reclining you can get seat by the steward staging area or other parts of the plane where it can\u2019t impact you.

I can just as easily say they should be the ones shelling out since they clearly don't fit into their allotted space. My partner is a big guy. He likes first class for actually having leg room.

Drinks, devices, food, etc", "It often impacts how well you can utilize your tray table.", "My personal experience is, that they recline with force and the drink and what ever you have on your little tablet is just going for a fly if you have not good reaction skills. Just followed by somebody who is throwing the long hairs into your own coke. I would prefer this seats had not the function. It was a good function when you still had more space, but not anymore.", "Being reclined in an airline seat is more uncomfortable than not because it doesn't recline far enough so if I want to look at anything like a book or my phone I have to push my neck forward uncomfortably.\n\nBut I also like my car seats more upright than most people do so maybe it's just my body proportions/height (I'm 6'1\")", "they wouldn't even need to buy 2 seats, they can upgrade to seats with extra leg room", "I fly every week for work and everyone I know thinks it's extremely rude to recline. My coworker even bought us all knee defenders to help out. If it wasn't a common idea that it's rude to recline why is there a well selling device that has been featured in a lot of newspapers and magazines to prevent it? The NYT even had an editorial praising the knee defender for protecting your space.", "I've been on multiple flights where my drink or food has been spilled because I'm using the tray table and the asshole in front of me decides it's recline time. It happens a lot.", "It definitely has happened to me. I try to check behind and recline as gently as possible but there's only so much any of us can do.  \n\n\nI don't think it's a design feature, I just don't think the airlines particularly took our comfort into consideration when designing this.", "This is so weird because only last week or so, another AITA thread with the same theme concluded that longleggedy people should buy the seats with extra legroom. \n\nAnd here OP is blithely stating that they know the problem, know there is a solution, and do not use it.\n\nReddit is odd", "Wonder if you'd make the same argumet for someone overweight.", "It's a huge assumption that someone else can afford to pay for extra anything", "Hey! I appreciate you and yeah, the men's section is still definitely hard to find stuff in! I just find it especially frustrating as I can hem pants if they're too long but I can't make them longer if they're not, unless they have a ton of leftover material rolled over which most brands don't.\n\nI have tried men's jeans/pants so many times hoping I could make it work like you said - maybe by tailoring the waist in after sizing up for the hips - but so far I have not really succeeded at finding a pair. There's always something weird going on with excess fabric in one place or not enough in another. The only exception so far is I thrifted a pair of AE skinny jeans in a 28x32 that I love. I only realized they were men's jeans when I could put a whole phone in the pocket, haha. But they seem to be a unicorn...\n\nI'm always down to shop whatever fits. I have very broad shoulders for a cis woman so I thrift a decent number of men's button downs for example, and I love vintage suiting so big fan of thrifting those. Just something about my bottom half's shape is not friendly with men's cuts :((", "When you start lopping off several inches, the proportions get reallyyyy screwy. Hemming works if they're a touch too long, but if you've really short legs it's not a great option.", "Lol right? Hemming can't fix everything since sometimes it means the ankle opening ends up being too wide or weirdly shaped, but it's at least doable. Can't really do the reverse.", "Yeah mine is about the same as my Dad\u2019s who is 6\u20192 lol.", "Yeah sorry, I get horrible neck cramps if I can't recline.  I've been in the back seats a few times and I think everyone should recline if they have space.  I've never seen the person in front ask permission.\n\nIf the person behind is crowded, they can ask the reclined person to negotiate the amount of recline, or ask if they can swap with a nearby passenger sitting behind a non-recliner", "I\u2019ve never been on a flight where people don\u2019t recline their seats. From the UK if that makes a difference? Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve flown very much though!", "So you\u2019re saying all 100+ passengers on the flight should be uncomfortable in order to avoid a situation where the 6-12 people sat in the uncomfortable back row are\u2026 uncomfortable?", "Her space? It's LITERALLY his space. He's sitting in seat he paid for, while some lady is smashing her seat into his legs.", "I just commented above, but the Asos and Long Tall Sally websites have been lifesavers to me. I\u2019m a 36\u201d-38\u201d inseam and finding long enough pants in regular stores is impossible. Asos has a huge \u201ctall\u201d section (they carry a lot of different brands) and Long Tall Sally is 100% made for taller women. I\u2019m pretty sure their return policies are good as well. I wish these sites had been around when i was younger.", "Yeah just sit up during meal times and you\u2019re doing as good as can be expected imo", "No I\u2019m from the US and all the flights I\u2019ve been on the majority of the people on the plane recline their seats. I\u2019ve never been asked, and I\u2019ve never asked if it\u2019s okay."]}
