They are not AHs for wishing to avail of something that is part of normal seat functionality. \n\nMy husband is 6'6\" and all of that extra height is in his legs but we don't blame other passengers for the lack of legroom in economy, that's down to the airlines. We ask with respect and politeness if they would be willing to sacrifice use of their reclining seat so he is able to fit into the space. And are grateful if they do.\n\nBut we also look to minimise this issue coming up by paying extra for emergency aisle or premium economy seats with extra legroom. \n\nThe lack of legroom for tall passengers sucks but it's not the other passengers' faults either.\n\nYTA", "NTA. Flights are already expensive, and it was a relatively short flight. If the flight starts to go longer, I would encourage you to maybe go for the emergency seats so people can recline a bit to get some sleep. I get you can't control the bs the airlines do by cramming us in like sardines or your size, but you can always try to take some steps to help out your fellow passengers in the future", "NTA. It\u2019s not the passenger\u2019s fault that airlines cram in a lot of seats. The person in front is not an AH for wanting to recline but they are an AH for making such a fuss", "Yta for expecting people not to recline", "YTA because of this sentence: I feel that people who decline their seats in economy are annoying and inconsiderate. Newsflash, they pay for that. Your whole idea of not encroaching into other peoples space is bullshit if you\u2019re preventing her from using the full capacity of the seat she purchased. This issue has happened before. You knew going into this flight that you were going to affect the person in front of you negatively. This is the same thing as someone being too wide to fit in just one seat", "YTA. \n\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault that you\u2019re tall and you deserve a comfortable plane ride. I understand that you didn\u2019t want to encroach on your neighbor\u2019s space either. \n\nHowever, YTA for thinking she doesn\u2019t deserve to recline. Some people are banking on being able to recline a little bit for sleep. If you need more leg room, pay for the upgraded seat or at least speak to the flight crew about a possible upgrade. It makes you AH that you\u2019re inconsiderate of her comfort too, not just your own.", "YTA, rather upgrade or check in early to see if you can get an exit row seat for free.", "YTA\n\nYou say you don't encroach on other people's space. Yes you do.\n\nYta for lying here.\n\nThe chairs can recline and that space belongs to the person in front.\n\nYta", "YTA.\nThe person in front of of you has paid for the seat and it\u2018s recline.\nIf you are close to 2m, then buy business class tickets or seats with more space. \nOr fly a airline with larger space between the eco seats. They are there ;)", "YTA\n\nThose seats are meant to be reclined, everyone has a right to do it. I don't believe that you're so tall that you can't stretch your legs out straight under the seat in front of you.", "That. Is fking tall.", "I never fly. Is it bad to expect to be able to recline, since that's what the seats do?", "This is it.\n\nIt isn't a case of not allowing someone to recline if the space provided is not big enough to do so. Seat spaces are very poorly designed for taller or larger people.\n\nI'm with you on this one - NAH.", "Why can't his legs go under the seat in front? His height is the issue, why can't he adjust himself to not take away someone else's space?", "Orrrrr since he can\u2019t control his proportions.,,,she could have paid to upgrade if she needed to recline that badly. \n\nHe didn\u2019t need more room. He fit. Just meant she couldn\u2019t recline. Too bad. So sad. Why was her comfort more important than OPs or his seat mates.", "It's the tallest guy I have ever met.\n\nOf course, he was behind me.\n\nKicking my seat when moving. \n\nI can't ask him to be less tall lol", "No, reclining is normal. My opinion is that OP stopping someone from reclining is the AH. Since it was physically impossible, there is nothing OP could do on this flight, but now that they know this going forward I would consider them the AH if they don\u2019t purchase a larger seat so as not to inconvenience the people around them.", "But he doesn\u2019t fit if she wants to recline. And she does. So he does not fit. \n\nHer seat reclines and she\u2019s entitled to be comfortable. So if he can\u2019t fit when she\u2019s utilizing the amenity of her seat\u2019s recline feature, then he does not fit, IMO.", "Also\u2026 her comfort isn\u2019t more important. Everyone should be comfortable. This guy is making HER uncomfortable. HE is encroaching on the space she is provided by the seat recline. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have to pay the price for someone else\u2019s proportions. He shouldn\u2019t be an AH and he should get a seat that doesn\u2019t inconvenience people. Those seats exist.. he\u2019s just choosing to not even ask for one.", "Yes, everyone expect the woman to give up her comfort to benefit a man and keep him comfortable.\ud83d\ude44\n\nI doubt he would have tired this shit if it was a guy in uniform or one bigger than him, probably not even if it was just another man.", "Thank you!"]}
