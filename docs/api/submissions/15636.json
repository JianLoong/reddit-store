Airlines need to be held accountable for the situations that their uncontrollable greed has created. It\u2019s outrageous the amount of coddling airlines get from the government just to turn around and bend the customers over at every possible juncture, from checked bag fees to seat fees.

There's no rule that states you must have xcm clearance between your knees and the seat in front.

You could fit just fine into the seat, until she tried reclining hers. You'd be paying extra for her comfort, not for yours. \n\nI wish they'd just get rid of the recline on economy seats, to be honest.

It makes my tray table basically useless, same with my screen.", "Light YTA especially because you said that you've caused this issue to people before. \n\nI know you can't change your height but we pressure fat people to buy 2 seats to not inconvenience those around them so it should be reasonable to expect you to pay for leg room to not inconvenience the people around you.

The spaces are ridiculous without someone encroaching on the tiny space you've paid for.", "YTA.  You know the issue occurs. Seats are made to recline and people are allowed to recline them, otherwise why have the recline feature at all? People might have been travelling for ten or fifteen hours already and need to sleep.

If they try and make seats bigger to accommodate heavier passengers they should do the same with taller people. Nah", "NTA.  I feel like economy is a form of hell.  We all must endure the torture given us in the hope of salvation:a quick flight and instant deboarding with all luggage waiting.  Being nasty should give them increased torture.  You did fine.", "NTA. Also I\u2019m obviously in the minority here but I agree with you that reclining is inconsiderate. Everyone may have a right to do it, but does that make it right? I personally never recline because I know I dislike it when the seat in front of me has been pushed even closer to me. I treat others how I wish to be treated.

But I do highly recommend you search for seats with more legspace when you fly more than 3 hours. People like to nap. The situation also fully depends on whether you have a day- or night flight in my opinion.   \n\n\nAs someone who unfortunately has to fly often for work, usually short flights, I like to keep my seat up to not be inconsiderate to others. Unless I want to nap (think early morning flight, lots of meetings later that I prefer not to do in a brain-fog).  \nI've flown twice for a long flight (10+ hours) with sort of being the woman who sat in front of you. The first time the person behind me was just very tall (almost 2meters) and I couldn't recline without hurting his knees. I noticed, looked behind me a bit annoyed as I had hoped to catch some sleep but he explained he couldn't help it. I understood and didn't try to recline anymore. It was a dayflight, so I could read or just look outside (never realised how incredibly big the Sahara desert is until I flew over it). Again: it was a dayflight and he coulnd't help his height as much as I can't help mine, which is why I didn't mind. If this was your situation, I strongly vote NTA.  \n\n\nIt changes if your situation was a bit like the second interaction with a tall person I had. The second time I flew through the night and I had run out of vacation days so I had to work the next morning (literally had to log in 2 hours after getting out of the plane, yes it was very tight). The person behind me did everything in their power to prevent me from reclining. Pushing my seat so it was difficult to recline, putting their feet next to the little movie-screen and kicking and pushing there. When I came back from the bathroom they had taken it upon themselves to move my seat back into the upright position. The plane was fully booked, the flight attendants couldn't help me or him. He was a tall man, but I checked and he had just a bit of space between my seat reclined and his knees (not much though, I will admit that). He called me \"extremely selfish and entitled\" for wanting to recline my seat (I was wearing a sleep mask, headphones, and took a hefty dose of melatonin so it was very clear what my intentions were). He was an extreme a-hole and I even heard him complaing (loudly) to the person next to him that \"normally the airline upgrades him for free when he checked in and they saw he was fairly tall\". So he hadn't bought a seat with extra leg space because he wanted that upgrade for free, all the while he knew this would be a potential problem! Again, he had some space left, but not much. Let's say if he put a bigger snack in the little bag in front of him that would've touched his knees.  \nLet's say I had one hell of a night and flight, had multiple stab-y thoughts, and had an extremely hard time staying awake the next day during meetings.", "YTA.  I pay extra for more space because I know I need it.  Yes, the airlines are assholes for making everything so uncomfortable, but that's not your fellow passengers' fault.", "YTA.\n\n>If I'm honest, I feel that people who recline their seats in economy are annoying and inconsiderate, so I didn't exactly bend over backwards to accommodate for her.\n\nWhy is it inconsiderate for people to use the seat as designed???

The idea there should be an extra tax you're forced to pay, so you aren't in other peoples way is offensive and discriminatory.\n\nIMO if she cant sit up straight without sitting at a slight angle maybe she should buy first class seats instead? Because you had zero problems.", "Hilarious that some people on here will say a fat person needs two seats and then give a tall person a pass for not getting a seat with extra leg room. \n\nKind of an AH. She had a right to recline. Sorry you don\u2019t fit. Short people have to use things design for taller people every moment of every day. Sorry on flights you don\u2019t fit, but won\u2019t pay for more leg room.", "NAH.  The real culprit are the airlines who created seating that gives 6 inches of leg room and reclining seats.

I agree that if you have special circumstances that require you to have more than normal space, you need to pay for the extra emergency row. The seat reclined is a normal function of the normal economy seats, so she should\u2019ve been able to use it. It\u2019s not your fault you\u2019re tall, but it\u2019s even less her fault! So I don\u2019t see why she should be the one to suffer for it.", "YTA - And lying to yourself. You are intruding into the space around you by making sure the person in front of you can't recline their seat. They're allowed to do that. You are too big for the seat. Yes, the seats are too f-ing small. I'm stupidly short and sometimes it feels like the seats are too close for me to be comfortable but that doesn't mean you get to punish the people around you.

I have never attempted to recline my seat because you don't know the situation of the person sitting behind you and it's entirely possible to settle in and take a nap with the seat fully erect, even at my size. \n\nNTA, OP.

We should focus on the fact that airlines onky cater to the 5'6 150 lb and below humans.", "I think that the airline industry loves it when the passengers blame each other for the uncomfortable seating they packed into the plane.\n\nNo, you are NTA for refusing to make yourself and one or more people uncomfortable to suit someone who doesn't understand that your legs are the length they grew, and that it is the airlines who are the real assholes for cramming people in like sardines.", "INFO: would you be comfortable potentially having to help folks if you were in an exit / wing seat during an accident?\n\nIf so, then I would say going forward, provided you can afford to do so, then it would be best to go for an extra legroom seat (including emergency exit seats). \n\nOtherwise, I would say NTA because you can\u2019t help how small planes are.

Half the time a 13 inch laptop barely fits in a basic economy seat nowadays. \n\nI\u2019d also much rather have the person in the window and middle recline and sleep. Literally my last international flight, computer McGee middle seat asked me to get up 4 times in a sub 7 hour flight. I sit in the aisle so I can get up and not once did he go while I was already up.\n\nPersonally I\u2019ve never had an issue with someone reclining the seats. They barely recline anymore anyway. Even before they recline I\u2019m to tall to sleep leaning forward on the tray table. Like yeah it\u2019s annoying there seat is closer but I\u2019ve literally never seen a reclined seat touch the chest of a person sitting back in their own seat.\n\nI may not be overly tall, still above average, but I do have broad shoulders and have been fairly heavy at points in my life. Never once has a reclined seat touched me in my seat. Kept me from getting up, or stopped me from using my tray table. It does make using a laptop impossible, but like news flash it\u2019s impossible to use a laptop on a basic economy seat without being an asshole to anyone you share an armrest with as you almost certainly got to elbow an inch over the arm rest to use it. So  computer users are basically doing a constant moving elbow knead massage to the person next to you: how blissful.\n\nMy theory based on personal experience is there is a ton of overlap in the ven-diagram of no recline people and economy laptop users. In large part because that\u2019s what reclining really makes impossible. Thus for the people in the overlap, the sense of superiority is ridiculous. I mention the computer because I\u2019ve frequently been by a member of team no recline that only hates it because then they can\u2019t get out their laptop to elbow other people for however many hours. \n\nIf you need to work on a flight, that\u2019s literally the purpose of business class. If you hate reclining you can get seat by the steward staging area or other parts of the plane where it can\u2019t impact you.
