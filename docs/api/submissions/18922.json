To give an example, after she graduated school, she utilized emotional blackmail to essentially economically abuse my parents.

She never even came on my dad's birthday unless she needed some money. She would always have an excuse but, on her own birthday, it seemed she always had enough time to borrow money from our dad and go to a club with her friends.\n\nWith this background out of the way: My brother recently got married and my sister-in-law (SIL) is an amazing person. She is the sort of person that ensures everyone is involved in everything even if it means compromising her own fun. With this in mind, she would come for all of my dad's birthdays and even on random weekends to make sure my dad and mom were comfortable.\n\nThis was great and everyone loved my SIL except for my sister. She, noticing how everyone loved my SIL, became incredibly jealous. It was fine at first but as my parents grew increasingly closer to my SIL and got annoyed at the excuses of my sister to even come for a visit, this became much more. My sister blames all of this on my SIL, saying that she was trying to replace her.\n\nThis all boiled over a few weeks ago, when, on our dad's birthday, my SIL helped organize a party for my dad. My sister originally said she was busy so she wouldn't come but when she heard my SIL was there, she drove right over. As soon as she entered she started playing passive aggressive and, after noticing how everyone was thanking my SIL for arranging the party, she burst.\n\nShe basically called her a \"bitch\", a combination of racial slurs and uneducated. She was lucky that my brother wasn't here at the time (he was driving over from his job) or this could have turned ugly.\n\nThis pissed me off so much that I basically started swearing back at my sister for yelling at my SIL.

There is no reason on earth that your sister should have blown up at your sister in law, nevermind go as far as using racial slurs to demean her for doing something her lazy self could never do.

This isn\u2019t her world, she can\u2019t just keep walking over people (especially your dad) and her jealousy over your SIL, who sounds amazing btw, proves that maybe she knows she\u2019s a shitty daughter.\nI understand the part where you say you feel bad, I am also not the kind of person to shout or yell. Also I would disagree that it isn\u2019t your fight, you stood up for your SIL, your sister didn\u2019t take the time to get to know her, and she clearly didn\u2019t appreciate your family.", "If your sister was yelling casteist slurs at your SIL the only acceptable solution is to completely cut her off, and report her to the SC/ST tribunal so she can be arrested for breaking the law. Hate speech and casteist remarks/slurs are against the law. You all have enabled this nonsense by trying to shield her from her shit. \n\nI am an indian and I am genuinely furious at reading this.", "NTA - reading the comments and your feedback, sounds like a difficult cultural situation. Your immediate family is on your side and know what you did was right. I am sorry about your extended family. It sounds like you are absolutely right that your extended family is prejudiced against your sister in law which is clouding their judgement. This may be difficult, but stick to your values knowing that your immediate family has your back!!!", "NTA. Don't apologize. Fuck that. This is a long time coming. Your parents are at fault as well for enabling her shitty behavior most of her life.", "NTA- and tell the relatives it isn\u2019t their business, and just because someone cries crocodile tears doesn\u2019t mean you need to apologize.", "and I understand feeling bad because it isn\u2019t within your nature to yell, but in this situation it was COMPLETELY called for. additionally, it\u2019s quite concerning that racist rhetoric is what your sister resorted to and is a big reflection of her character. I would question if this is something she has done before and why no one has checked her.", "She is but I'm not sure yelling was the right way to go about it. I feel bad that I had to stoop to it to prevent her from berating my SIL.", "The thing is, our SIL is Indian and so are we. The thing is, however, my SIL is of darker tone and colourism in India is very pervasive. Even then the racial slurs she used were both in our native language but also English racial slurs that I am not sure I want to even write. But yes, its the one you are thinking of.", "It might not have been the most classy thing you could do, but yelling at someone for being a racist and using racial slurs is certainly not the least classy thing you could do either.", "That sounds awful. Colorism is so pervasive and it spreads like an infection. She absolutely should not be apologized to because she\u2019s old enough to know better. The best thing you can do is honestly nip this in the bud and show everyone in your family that there are consequences to being ignorant/bigoted. I\u2019m so sorry that this even happened.", "You're right but, and I am afraid to even find this out, I have a feeling that my extended family shares a similar opinion of my SIL due to her darker-tone.\n\nIt's odd to explain to a non-Indian person, but fair skin is a huge deal in India and so is a thing called caste.\n\nMy SIL is from a lower caste and is darker. My brother and my family is fairer and from a higher caste.\n\nWhile I know my immediate family is progressive on caste and colourism, my extended is definitely not.\n\nThey had on numerous occasions told my brother to stay away from my SIL due to her skin colour and caste. My parents stood up for my brother luckily and they got married and I got a wonderful sister.\n\nI am afraid that, partially. they support my sister because they share those same racial attitudes towards my SIL like my sister.\n\nI am afraid of basically dividing my family, although I know I'll continue to stand up for my SIL.", "Reminds me why it's so good to not live in india anymore (it has its advantages but holy the cons are bad)", "Since your immediate family is more progressive, I would recommend that you talk to them about how your sister should be handled after this situation. Although family is very important, that does not put them before staying true to your morals. If you do not align with a colorist/racist ideology, then I think it\u2019s within your best interests to get away from people who align with it openly.\n\nCutting off family is always much easier said than done, but if they cannot condemn your sister for her blatantly wrong actions then there is no telling to what lengths they\u2019ll let bigotry slide.\n\nIf they cannot appreciate your sister in law for the sweet and hard-working person she is, and instead choose to back a lazy, selfish, entitled brat then they can deal with the consequences of such. Because if I\u2019m sure she cannot make the time to visit home, then she will certainly not make time to help them out when the time comes. I am glad that you gained a wonderful sister but it could be time to lose one as well.", "If your older sister doesn\u2019t act with honor, then there should be no expectation to honor her.  I\u2019m confident this is a cultural expectation (sister and extended family saying not to argue with her since she\u2019s oldest)-however I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s expected that the eldest sibling conduct themselves as a role model, give a shit about their family and be a leader for the younger siblings to follow. Otherwise, why bother respecting and honoring them?", "Well... Assuming your brother and SIL are planning on having children, you're not just defending your SIL, you're defending their future children. \n\nBecause regardless of which parent's skin tone those kids inherit, a family that accepts colorism - and looks down on SIL because of it - is not going to be a healthy family to grow up in. \n\nSome things are worth dividing family over. Ensuring that toxic colorism is not an accepted part of life definitely seems like one of those things.\n\nAnd that's true regardless of whether or not they have kids.", "India is changing and progress is being made. A marriage like that of my brother and SIL would have been met with violence only decades ago given our castes.\n\nBut things are changing and changing fast. India may become the second country in Asia to allow for gay-marriage after Taiwan (the Supreme Court is currently hearing arguments and it legalized homosexuality just a decade ago).\n\nCaste is slowly also starting to break at the seams although the struggle to abolish it from society is far from over.", "She's so amazing, you don't even know. And you're right, I have to fight this through.", "You're NTA, your sister is. To an outsider, it sounds like your parents have somewhat enabled her in the past, so in addition to being on your side, they should actively be taking on some of the responsibility to smooth things over with family. Your outburst and her reaction sound like they're both from the same place - her being hugely entitled because she's never been given a reality check before.", "NTA. AT is your bad sister and the family on her side. She owes her an apology.

Why are they all enabling her to this end? It's gotta stop. She sounds like a monster. Poor SIL.", "NTA. Tell the family on her side that as the older sister she should damn well know better than to throw a tantrum and be a petty, vindictive person all the time, if she bothered to show up at all. She's jealous and it just makes her look worse that her behaviour already does.\n\nAlso its time to convince your immediate family to cut her off financially. She can go to the extended family for support and try her same tricks on them.\n\nMaybe come up with am itemized list of everything shes done/ everytime shes asked for money/ made family pay for stuff and how much it cost vs how much shes given back. That simply put the family can't afford to indulge her anymore and that the emotional and monetary cost is draining them terribly. Yes still support her in actual emergencies (dont tell her that) but no more paying for nights out or non essentials, if she asks for money for food buy groceries, for medicine get the medicine/prescription for her, if she asks for money for school find out what it is she needs and if its actually relevant/worth it pay them directly just a one off payment. Don't give her actual money again.\n\nAfter all as the Eldest she should be setting a good example by working for her money, not mooching off parents.", ">She basically called her a \u201cbitch\u201d, a combination of racial slurs and uneducated.\n\nRacist sister gets to take a one way trip to Assholeville.

Perhaps you could have done so without swearing, but this clearly came from a place of protective anger, and I\u2019m not one to argue against that. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think your sister is the whole problem here. This behaviour should have been shut down *years* ago, and by one of your parents, not you. Yes, she clearly has a con going on, but they were, and still are, adults, who are capable of seeing this behaviour for what it is. At this point, they\u2019re being wilfully blind. They have allowed this behaviour to go unchecked for so long, she genuinely believes she can verbally abuse someone and get away with it because \u2018I\u2019m the eldest\u2019.

No, you aren't the asshole. Your SIL deserved your support because she did nothing to justify your sisters bullshit, and she was being singled out and verbally abused by your sister. Your sister is basically emotionally abusive, neglectful of friends and family, and toxic as all hell, and only got this way because your SIL shook up the situation and allowed people to realize they could have the kind of relationship with a daughter they need without pining for your sisters attention.

She has done nothing to earn your respect. On the other hand, your SIL has earned your affection, gratitude and respect by her kindness and emotional investment in your family.

But remember - you are not dividing your family. Family members with those views and prejudices are doing that.

It has about a fifth of the World's total population, so even if the **percentage** of racist/colourists/ caste hugging AHs is very small that would still mean a whole lot of people.\n\nI mean the USA has about 300 million people (?) and the issues with racism, homophobia AND transphobia are running wild (no offenses) even after so much protests by the good American people.
