It\u2019s none of his business where you bought your house. His father sounds like a sexist pig for that comment about you should be moving in with your BF. Seems like an independent woman buying her own home by herself makes his father uncomfortable.", "NTA, but if what I'm reading correctly, is that you view your relationship as being very recent. Because depending on how much time you're spending with each other, you're right 6 months isn't a long time.\n\nYour boyfriend and his family on the other hand, think 6 months is a very long time and that his father has a right to talk down to you. He's entitled to have an opinion, he's not entitled to speak to you about it.\n\nIt also feels weird like if you only actually known this guy for somewhere around 6 months, that you already have met his parents, and that even though he doesn't live with you, he wants his parents to tour your home.

You are independent, you can move on fast if this relationships won't work and, even if you move in with your boyfriend, you will always have another house to rent out and have an additional income. A lot of men are threatened by it because they do not have the means and enough experience to deal with an equal partnership, they need a woman to have be more dependent, so men can be control easier and try to get out of their chores and parenting by playing a \"I'm a breadwinner\" card. It won't work with you, so his father is disappointed and wants to bring you down to \"know your place\", so you wont feel as accomplishedas you are. Considering his son never corrects him and tells you not to pay attention, he might share his father's feelings, but has more tact not to say it out loud.\n\nYou are a house owner! You should be proud of yourself, no one has the right to bring you down. I assume your BF got a single house, so his father feels the need to compare and say yours is not as good. Very nasty behavior. \n\nAlso, NTA. Minimize your exposure to the parents. If your BF asks about inviting his father again, say, that, he told you not to pay attention to what his father says, so you will be doing just that - not paying attention to anything he says, including him voicing his desire to tour your house. He cannot demand something of you and put you down at the same time.", "Even weirder", "Seriously, like you've been together 6 months, he doesn't live with you, and he invalidates your feelings on his father speaking to you incorrectly?

I have never asked for advice from anyone regarding my financial situation, and I don\u2019t have to answer to anyone regarding my finances, so at this point, I feel like some personal space and privacy is appropriate, lest I am subjected to more unasked for and unwelcome commentary on my personal life.\u201d", "This.
