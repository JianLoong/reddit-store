It may be that she is finding displays of physical affection off-putting because she is subconciously feeling her own lack of receiving it. Maybe sit down with her and ask her if she would feel better about other people being affectionate if she started receiving some hugs from friends? People NEED physical affection, it is vital to our mental, emotional and physical well being. She may need to start getting hugs from her friends <you and gf> to help her through this rough patch. Also see if she can examine exactly WHAT it is that bothers her about it. Self examination is crucial for growth, once she starts reflecting on HER own responses and why, she should have a breakthrough and get some vital insight on her reactions to this particular trigger.  \n\nAlso, if she attracts toxic, icky guys, here is a link to a FREE and easy to read ebook that can show her all the red flags to watch out for so she can make better choices. It is suoer easy to read and informative and shows what to look for to avoid icky and toxic guys. \n\nGood luck. And give her hugs, nothing sexual, just friend hugs, we all need them on occasion.", "NTA \n\nYou were in your own home, not waiting in line at the Texas Roadhouse, chowing down on free peanuts.  Her insecurities about PDA be damned.  She doesn't get to gatekeep your affection on your own couch.  You were hugging, not getting a handy.", "ESH. I think it's really awkward to be a third wheel while the only other people in the room are cuddling (and doing who knows what) under a blanket. Personally, I would never snuggle with my husband if we had another person over to watch a film. That being said, she took it to a level it certainly didn't need to go.   \n\n\nAs for not being interested in celeb drama, that's called growing up. Any adult who cares who a celebrity is dating is boring AF", "NTA\nYou cuddling in your own home is not violating her boundaries. She can't expect the rest of the world to pretend that romance doesn't happen just because she's lonely.", "ESH", "INFO: What was the extent of this cuddling? How cozy are we getting here?", "NTA  \n\n\nSarah is totally an AH, and y'all did nothing wrong to provoke her reaction to the cuddling. She needs to perhaps seek professional help", "ESH.\n\nYou and your gf know pda makes Sarah uncomfortable so..you do it anyway. She most likely felt like a third wheel which is the last thing anyone needs when they're feeling crappy about dating. That said, I don't think her reaction was right. In her shoes, I'd have just quietly left if I felt awkward. \n\nYour angry retort seems a bit odd to me if I'm honest; she is literally trying to work on herself, you said this at the start of your post. Maybe she's realising that relationships simply aren't for her? Who knows. In any case, her losing her rag doesn't mean she has no self-respect. A lack of self control, maybe, given how she snapped at you.", "NTA... Sara is toxic and clearly didn't work on her self. Instead she became bitter and resentful of everyone who has what she doesn't have. That is literally the opposite of working on yourself.\n\nIn this case I think you all need to have a conversation about whether you all want to remain friends with her or not. If you do then try to make up with her. If not then just leave it and see if she realizes what happens when you treat people like crap.\n\nAlso what boundaries would u have been crossing?", "I'm going to say ESH, but mostly her.  It does sound like she has entered the \"cynical\" phase of being single, and I can imagine that it's very annoying to hear her complaining all of the time.  But I think what you said was rude, because it's possibly not true.  She is moving through the phases of accepting single life and working on herself.  Everyone goes through the cynical phase during this time, it's just that some people express it a lot more than others.  \n\nI also kind of feel for her, because (having been in her shoes as the single friend), it can get very annoying being around the \"couply\" couples when you are the single third wheel.  And, while you're absolutely allowed to cuddle in your own home, being around that is not always fun for the single friend.  I know that when I'm single, the couples that I always have the most fun spending time with, just the three of us, are the ones that you may not know that they are a couple if you didn't know them, because they don't act like it.", "ESH - Her reaction to the cuddling was inappropriate and you had every right to stand your ground. It\u2019s not even the attitude comment in terms of attracting a relationship that feels like you crossing the line. \n\nIt\u2019s the self esteem comment. Cynicism and a lack of self esteem aren\u2019t the same thing. Nothing about her attitude that you have described indicates a lack of self esteem. Attributing attitudes you personally don\u2019t like to a lack of self esteem is really a problematic attitude, in and of itself. It\u2019s a harmful attitude in many ways, and it\u2019s that particular comment from you that is the problem.", "ESH\n\nYou know she struggles with PDA, but couldn't wait while hanging out with her. Not exactly being great friends.\n\nYour white knight jumping to defend your girlfriend was odd. She can speak for herself. What you said was also pretty shitty.\n\nDepending on the context, maybe her claims of victim blaming her is correct, but maybe not. Either way, being a bitter incel is a bad look for anyone.", "You did her a huge favor", "NTA. I've known people like this. They've had a bad time of it romantically and are then jealous and resentful of others' relationships. Inside, they're thinking 'I'm better than her. Why does she get the nice guy?' \n\nIt's a destructive path and I don't think she sees how unreasonable it is to ask someone in their own home to stop showing affection. Your reply was blunt, but how else is she going to realise she's starting to become unpleasant to be around? \n\nPersonally I would apologise for being blunt, but explain that you're not going to stop showing affection to your gf to protect Sara's feelings - because she is not a victim.", "YTA. I'm not excusing her behaviour or her views but you invited someone over for a movie knowing she doesn't like PDA and then do it on the same bloody couch. Why invite her over in the first place.", "NTA\n\nAlso lol at victim-blaming", "ESH.  You said yourself her attitude has just become like this in the last year, meaning her attitude back when she was dating was not like she is now. \n\nShe needs to get over herself or just leave if she is bothered.", "NTA.\n\nWhile it's good that she's on a break from dating, she obviously hasn't had any success in improving herself yet. \n\nAnd she wants an apology for \"victim blaming\"? She's only a victim of her own bitterness.\n\nMake sure she respects your boundaries going forward - as in your property boundaries. Don't allow her back in your home.
