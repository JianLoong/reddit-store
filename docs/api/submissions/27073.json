{"id": 27073, "submission_id": "16l5aau", "title": "AITA For Telling Clients That Their Dog Is Probably Miserable?", "selftext": "So I\u2019m conflicted here. I (22F) have a part-time WFH job, and decided that the best option for a second job would be something that I had a decent amount of control over for the hours/location, and something that got me out of the house, so I went back to pet sitting which I\u2019ve done on and off since I was 12.\n\nAnyways, a couple weeks ago, I went to visit my parents. They live about 3 hours down the coast. Before I headed over, I took a job watching a sweet lab mix named Leia. Her owners (50s/M+F) were leaving for a vacation for five days and they live about 15 minutes away from my parents. My duties were as follows: take Leia out twice a day for a walk, feed Leia once at 5:30pm, give her a morning pill, keep her water clean/full, and make sure to replace her diapers with fresh ones and wash the dirty ones. It seemed like an easy job and they were offering to pay quite well.\n\nI started to notice that when I\u2019d replace her diapers, they were never wet and never smelled of urine. I replaced them each time I took her out (so 2-3 times a day) and they were always clean except for some shedding. I even started checking a bit more frequently, but the entire time I was there she only wet her diaper once, and I think the bad weather was to blame. It stormed in the middle of the third night. I thought it was strange given that she had incontinence issues.\n\nWhen Leila\u2019s owners returned, they paid me in cash and thanked me for caring for their dog. We small talked a bit about Leia and how our week has been, and I told them I was impressed she only wet herself once since she was incontinent. They both laughed and the husband said Leia wasn\u2019t incontinent. Confused, I asked what the diaper was about, and he said they keep her in those because they stay out all day sometimes, or leave overnight, and don\u2019t want her using the bathroom on the flooring or the carpets. I asked why they didn\u2019t just get a friend or a neighbor to let her out and they said it wasn\u2019t worth it if they were gonna be gone less than 48 hours. They could just leave her in a clean diaper with extra food and water and her pill hidden in the food and she\u2019d be fine.\n\nThis was incredibly upsetting to hear, and I told them that their dog is probably miserable when they do that. They didn\u2019t take that very well. Both of them yelled at me and insulted me and told me to get out and that I had no idea what I was talking about. I left, but afterwards I received texts about how I was a terrible sitter and I should refund their money PLUS pay them for the way I acted. I told my parents what happened as soon as I got back to their house, and while they agree with me that these people are mistreating their dog, they said it\u2019s none of my business and I shouldn\u2019t have opened my mouth. I\u2019m still getting texted daily by these people and I don\u2019t know how to feel.

You probably shouldn\u2019t have said that but their reaction is way over the top and shows that they know their behavior sucks.", "NTA that dog IS probably miserable, the fact that the owners won\u2019t drop this says they know it\u2019s wrong too. You did nothing wrong, even the way you said it was right. You didn\u2019t say \u201cthis animal is suffering you\u2019re horrible owners!\u201d you said \u201cthe dog is probably miserable when they leave it alone in a diaper for 48 hours\u201d you stated a fact.", "NTA. I\u2019d love knowing that my dog sitter stands up for animals. Don\u2019t give them their money back since you did exactly what was asked.
