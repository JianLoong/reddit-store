{"id": 28668, "submission_id": "174s4pc", "title": "AITA for pushing my ex-wife to refinance\u2026", "selftext": "My ex-wife (F40) and I (M47) went through a dissolution in June of 2015, over 8 years ago. She was awarded the house, which was mutually agreed upon as she is also the custodial parent of our 2 children. It was stated that she was financially responsible for making payments, and she was to make a reasonable effort to refinance.\n\nAt the time that we purchased the home, she did not have a job. So the mortgage company that we used did not put her on the loan, however she is on the deed. So, it\u2019s not as simple as removing my name from the loan, and just leaving her name on, since she\u2019s not on the loan at all.\n\nAnother problem is that PennyMac does not allow loan assumptions on the loan type that we had (USDA), so her only option is to refinance.\n\nI haven\u2019t made a huge deal about this, as it hasn\u2019t been a problem. She hasn\u2019t missed any payments, but it still was always on my radar that she would eventually need to get the house out of my name. \n\nWell, at least until now. My GF and I have been discussing the future, moving in together / marriage, and the fact that my ex\u2019s house is still in my name has become a deal breaker.\n\nSo, I\u2019ve started pushing my ex to work on refinancing the house out of my name. The problem is in doing so, the interest rates a so high right now, that the rate will go up by approximately 3%. \n\nTo offset that increase, starting in 2024, I\u2019m offering to forfeit my claim to both of my children for tax purposes. I would estimate that to be roughly $6k over the next several years.\n\nAITA for pushing her to refinance in the current economic climate with rates being as high as there are?", "created_utc": 1696962074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174s4pc/aita_for_pushing_my_exwife_to_refinance/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Doing nothing for 8 years is not reasonable effort.  Talk to a lawyer.", "Nta. She\u2019s had 8 years to refi and if this is the US she could have refi\u2019d in 2020/2021 in the 2-3% range. She made a conscious decision to not refinance 3 years ago when it could have literally decreased her monthly payments. She hasn\u2019t fulfilled her agreement to make a reasonable effort to refinance.", "NTA. She had plenty of time to take care of this prior to the rise in interest rates.", "Good luck. \u201cReasonable efforts\u201d. That was too elastic. Reasonable but too elastic. This won\u2019t happen. NTA.", "NTA.  It's been eight years and I assume she's been working most or all of that time.  I agree with your GF that your name still being on the loan and the deed for your ex-wife's house is a deal breaker.  If your name is on the loan, you're still responsible if your ex-wife is unable to pay.", "NTA!! that should have been part of her keeping the house, is it had to be put into her name. You may need to take her to court over it though to get it done/", "NTA.  The agreement was she was to refinance. It's been 8 years.", "NTA - But this is more of a question for your lawyer, how to enforce the refi clause of the dissolution.", "No as you are offering a solution to the high interest rates.  NTA and it would be a dealbreaker for me too so you are doing the right thing.  Unfortunately, you can't make your wife do that unless you take her back to court for contempt.", "INFO; Why didn't she refinance when the rates were super low just a couple of years ago?", "NTA it was part of your separation settlement that she agreed to. If she hadn't dragged her feet about it, the interest rate might have been lower.", "NTA. if she has done nothing for 8 years that is not your issue. Do not offer the tax compensation, that will only open the door for more financial requests. You have been patient and she has taken advantage of that.", "NAH.\n\nI suppose one could argue that you should have pushed sooner, but it's impossible to predict what finance rates will do over time. As it is, it was quite respectable of you to give her the leeway to keep things as they are, and she's really not an asshole for taking advantage given the circumstances.\n\nAt the same time, I fully understand your GF's perspective - having you on that mortgage can severely impact your ability to get a new mortgage.\n\nDefinitely move forward, maintaining politeness and respect and allowing a good amount of time for things to actually get done - but just because you don't rush it doesn't mean you'll let it slide.", "When you guys got divorced didnshe have a job? Refinancing should not have waited this long\n\nWith interest now, kinda yta for pushing for the worst moment", "NAH but I don't expect with interest rates close to 8% that she's going to refinance it and with no restrictions on timeframe to constrain her, I wouldn't blame her. This should have been pushed years ago. 6K over the next couple of years isn't going to make a difference in how much more those mortgage payments are going to be with a higher interest rate.", "YTA. The monthly payment that your ex is responsible for will double or more.  Mortgage rates are at 8%, a few years ago they were around 3%.", "YTA it sounds like you haven\u2019t done your due diligence and just want to kick the can down the road now that you have a new SO. While it\u2019s not ok that your ex didn\u2019t follow through on getting things refinanced your kids will be the ones to suffer if she either can\u2019t afford the house or has to make a significantly higher monthly payment. The servicer of your loan, PennyMac, doesn\u2019t determine if a loan qualifies for assumption. The investor, USDA, does and they have servicing guidelines that PennyMac has to follow. Most USDA loans ARE assumable (your ex would still have to go through an application process and be approved) so I\u2019d call USDA directly and speak with them to find out how to get the assumption process started. https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/single-family-housing-programs", "YTA\n\nOr more specifically, your GF is. This is the mother of your children, if she's behaved responsibly for 8 years then there is no reason why you need to force a financial hardship on her to satisfy your GF's ego. \n\nKeep it on your radar for next time interest rates go down - but I see no reason why you need to force her hand here, especially if there could potentially be a negative impact on your children.", "YTA.  \n\nIf you wanted your ex to be forced to refinance eventually you should have made that a priority when you were getting a divorce. You don't get to have buyers remorse about your divorce - it has never been required that she refinance, and it has never been reasonable for her to refinance, including now.  \n\nYou misrepresented your financial situation to your girlfriend, and THAT is the reason you are faced with a \"deal breaker\" now.  \n\nYour ex should not have to accept refinancing at a much higher interest rate just because you weren't honest with your girlfriend.  Stop pushing.  Even if you DO give up the tax benefit, it doesn't make up for it - I don't know how old your kids are but they won't be tax deductions their whole lives... but she gets to keep living there for the rest of her life if she wants.", "YTA for allowing this to go on for 8 years. Rates were much better even 3 years ago.\n\nNow you have a gf and want to make her refinance when rates are sky high. Smh", "Overall NTA, but you should have pressed this issue years ago.  I am also assuming that he house value went up significantly over the past few years as well.  It's been over 8 years.  That's 8 more years of payments paying down the principle owed on the house.  Even if she needs to refinance, it should be a much lower amount, but at a higher rate.  It also depends on what she wants her loan terms to be.  Doing a 30 year new loan should drastically reduce the amount owed per month.  Would need a bit more info to confirm this theory, but it should be true.", "Find out if a POA will work for credit purposes. \n\nWhen I divorced my ex got one car and I got the other;  BOTH our names were on both cars and while I never missed payment or had unpaid tolls/ tickets; he didn't GAF and it was a constant battle. I filed a POA on his car stating he's taking full responsibility.  Submitting that POA and the divorce docs removed it completely from all my credit reports regardless of my name was on it. And any time he was delinquent or missed a ticket or toll; i resubmitted the docs and they removed it from my responsibility. \n\nI don't know if it'll work on property but so it's been said mortgage companies can manually account for the removal of anything on your reports. If you apply for a mortgage and produce the court docs and a POA they may just skip it.", "Talk to an attorney. If she won't refi, you may need to ask the court to force the sale of the house and distribution of the proceeds to get you out from under this loan that she never made any effort to deal with. If she doesn't like that, it falls into the too bad, so sad category. She should have dealt with it back when the interest rates were low.", "NTA. Interest rates were super low during the pandemic. I refinanced my house from 4.5% to 2.99% in 2021. She could have refinanced then and taken advantage of the low rates. Sounds like it was more convenient for her this way.", "NTA it should have been done 8years ago! You are way to nice.", "Is there a way to search for ancient posts? Pretty sure I read this months ago.", "NTA.  She had plenty of time.", "Hold up y'all had a loan at what 4-5% interest and she didn't bother refinancing when people were getting rates in the 2-3% range? Might not sound like a lot but over 30 years that's a lot of interest. \n\nNTA but you should have pushed it way sooner. Having your name on a loan that you aren't benefiting from is just dumb. Hell she could have just decided not to pay the mortgage and you would have been forced to or at least forced into a legal battle over it.", "INFO\u2014can your ex qualify for the refinanced mortgage on her current income?", "NTA. Had the same problem with my ex. Hopefully you are on better terms than we were. She had 8 dang years and if she didn\u2019t take advantage of the recent low interest rates, that a her problem. Talk to a lawyer.", "USDA loans are assumable and PennyMac does allow for assumptions. Have you called them? Is it possible that she didn\u2019t qualify to assume it before?", "YTA\n\nLook: no one thought it was interest rates would look like what they do now.\n\nFirst, this is a bad time to borrow for you, thus you don't need off just yet. Likely it makes sense to wait a year, which is a fair timeline to give your ex.\n\nSecond, your kids are who will suffer if they end up losing their childhood home and have to move bc your ex can't afford whatever the new payments will be. You don't actually need the mortgage at this moment.\n\nESH you both let this drag on, but YTA if you put your kids last in all this....", "I happen to be in the business, if the divorce decree specifically indicates the ex spouse was awarded the house and is legally responsible for the mortgage then it\u2019s considered a court-ordered assignment of mortgage and treated by all lenders and and agencies as if it simply doesn\u2019t exist.  It should not hinder OP on getting their own mortgage.  As far as the assumption, if I were OP I\u2019d check with the lender to validate what the ex spouse has said is true most have an assumption department in which case they should allow them unless the ex doesn\u2019t qualify.", "looks like Ex wife was also court ordered to refinance and never has", "I honestly don\u2019t know. Probably off her radar.", "Yeah. I think ultimately the divorce lawyer(s) are kinda the AH here... \"reasonable effort to refinance\" is clearly not specific or time-limited enough. In divorce, as with all legal agreements... good contracts make good neighbors.\n\nI think OP should definitely make a more concrete, time or rate limited plan with ex-wife for refinancing. E.g., 3 years or when the rate is X% or lower, whichever comes first. While ex wife should have refi'd a long time ago, OP should have also considered his lack of action's impact on future relationships.", "I mean she's knowingly impacting OPs credit. He was unilaterally on the hook for the entirety of the loan. That makes her an AH.", "No, she did not have a job at the time of our dissolution.", "6k each year, for many years, not 6k over a couple years. Big difference. Also, the principal that she would be refinancing after 8 years of continued payments is also significantly less.  High rate sure, her fault for not doing it sooner, but again a lower principal and she can chose how long", "Not true at all. Her monthly with go up approximately $30-$40.", "Wdym he hasn't done his due diligence? She was the party who was supposed to refinance...", "8 years!!! The ex could have refinanced when it was in the 2%. She has no intention to ever follow court orders and refi.", "Okay but like, the ex was court ordered to refinance\u2026. So its not like hes being unreasonable here.\nShe also couldve taken the initiative to refinance during the times when interest rates were at their lowest\u2026and didnt.\n\nIts not OPs problem, she got the house - and is legally supposed to refinance to fully get him off the loan. Or else now hes responsible for paying for the mortgage if he decides not to or defaults etc.\n\nNTA", "It was reasonable to refi when rates were in the 2%. She would have saved money.", "He said he and girlfriend are getting serious about the future and moving in together.  Any creditor would see he has the existing mortgage on his credit report. He may not be able to move/ get a new mortgage because of that.   Entirely reasonable to realize this needs to get done eight freaking years later.  Too bad for ex she didn\u2019t get off her ass a couple short years ago when rates were extremely reasonable and it may have been to her great benefit and lowered her payments.  This is on her.", "How can you absolve the one responsible for this and currently living/making payments on the house of any responsibility? Absolutely pants on head crazy.", "Wasn\u2019t from me, I honestly think this is the first time I\u2019ve ever posted.", "Yes, she can.", "I\u2019ve had both USDA and PennyMac tell me no. PennyMac as recent as about 30 days ago, and USDA around Dec 22 / Jan 23.", "How has she been paying for the house then.", "She had a valid reason for not refinancing earlier, and OP chose not to enforce their agreement. \n\nOP may have a valid legal argument here - but it's still an asshole move to try and force her to refi into 8% interest rates when there is no real mitigating factor other than the GF doesn't like their arrangement.", "There's a bit of context here that's important: courts actually can and often DO make orders in divorce that one party refinance the house.  Not this \"reasonable effort\" thing, like they say to one party - you must refinance the house.  And a lot of times they'll even put a deadline.\n\n\"Reasonable effort\"?  Ok, maybe she could have made more effort.  But OP has never even pushed the point until now, and if he made out to his girlfriend that he could make his ex refinance the house whenever he wanted, he was lying to her.", "If she qualified.\n\nBut even if she did, it's kinda irrelevant now.  THEN was when he should have been pushing.  NOW it's not reasonable.", "Sorry about that. There was a strangely similar post months ago.\n\nIt\u2019s very nice that you and your ex work together, especially as you co-parent.\n\nDo what makes sense for you, but have this agreement amended in court.\n\nYou are NTA. You are simply taking care of you, and your children.", "Did they say why? I am a little baffled. Is it a section 502?", "She had to get a job after the dissolution, but until then, she was getting approximately $930/mo in child support and $500/mo in spousal support.", "You mean the valid reason is he wants to move on with his life and get married/buy a house with his girlfriend but\u2026can\u2019t bc when she had ample opportunities she didn\u2019t bc she didn\u2019t want to deal with it? She\u2019s had 8 years. 8 years of 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6% and so forth.", "What\u2019s the valid reason she had not to do it 2 or 3 years ago when interest rates were so low, and the principal was also lower?", "Then i guess it would be important to get the entire wording from the divorce document.\nHowever, in my understanding, reasonable effort in terms of law means: \nReasonable Efforts means, with respect to a given goal, the efforts that a reasonable person in the position of the promisor would use so as to achieve that goal as expeditiously as possible\n\nTherefore, i take it in laymans terms, the ex should have refinanced as soon as possible.", "No then was when she was legally obligated to do so. She failed to fulfill her legal obligations as set out by the divorce decree. Also just because the interest rates are higher now does not mean it's unreasonable for her to refinance immediately if she can afford that extra cost.\n\nOP could likely rake her over the coals for not having refinanced as court ordered if he wanted to push this legally. She failed, he was not obligated to remind or force her to do so.", "It\u2019s reasonable if he wants to move on with his life and can\u2019t. She\u2019s taken advantage of him for 8 years. She can do whatever she wants\u2026she\u2019s not tied to him and him making payments on her mortgage. Nope. She can buy a new house if she wanted. Him\u2026he\u2019s stuck. He can\u2019t do anything bc\u2026the mortgage is in her name. He\u2019s too much of a liability for any bank to do anything for him.", "Yes, it was a rural development loan. I still don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s not assumable.", "Yeah, as soon as she got a job and built up at least a year, plus your support, you should have pushed for refinance. \n\nKicked yourself in the foot by delaying and waiting. She most likely won't do it now (at least this year or next year) and there's really nothing you can do to force her to refinance, is there?", "Well talk to her but she fucked up not doing it years ago and you fucked up not pressing it years ago", "She could have used that income to refinance.", "Probably given that she was a SAHM who wasn't on the mortgage in the first place insufficient credit history and possibly not qualifying based on her income?", "We have no idea what efforts she made, only that if she made efforts, they were not fruitful. Ex was a SAHM at the time of divorce, and evidently she wasn't on the original mortgage so may not have had much credit history and might not have qualified for a mortgage in her own name. Also depending on how long she had been out of the work place her income at first may not have been sufficient for the banks to offer her a mortgage. This is probaably why the attorneys included the \"reasonable effort\" language in the order they proposed to the Court in the first place, if they knew she was unlikely to be able to do it right away.", "They have been divorced over 8 years, there is no timeline or financial excuse at this point that is valid. Taking it now at the higher rate is not unreasonable anyway, plenty of people have had to renew. She has to make reasonable efforts to take over the loan, not take it over when she finds the rate reasonable.", "How can you possibly know that? I don't know how long she was out of the workforce, but as someone who stayed at home with kids for a long time, it was probably five years after returning to the workplace before I had a sufficient income on my own to qualify for a mortgage because I had to return at entry level after having been out of the workforce for more than a decade. She probably also had to build up her own credit if she hadn't been on the mortgage during her marriage. And who knows if her job was effected by the events of 2020-2022?", ">I don't know how long she was out of the workforce, but as someone who stayed at home with kids for a long time, it was probably five years after returning to the workplace before I had a sufficient income on my own to qualify for a mortgage \n\nYou literally answered your own question. Seeing as how you will build a very sufficient credit rating in 2 years of using a credit card wisely and having bills in your name you pay on time there is no excuse. A people who had never worked before and has no credit can accomplish this is just a few years, there are no excuses.", "Except we don't know what she does for a living, or what wage she earns then or now. And if you rely on my example of say five years, you would note that her five years would have hit at the beginning of COVID.", "I don't care what she does for a living, 8 years is sufficient for anyone who has to make it to the level of taking over the mortgage to do so. There isn't a single excuse outside of her untimely death that will ever be a reason otherwise."]}
