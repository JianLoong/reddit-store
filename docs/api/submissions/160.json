After graduating she practiced briefly, but had financial issues. Her morbidly obese husband never got a job because he deals with crippling anxiety and is afraid to work. During the 2019 holidays, my sisters husband spent the rent money on a luxury item, and my sister had to borrow $2k from me for rent.\n\nThat same Christmas holiday my mother also borrowed $2000 from me for months of backrent. My parents got divorced more than a decade ago for money related problems. During that divorce, my mother admitted that she had a gambling problem in my youth. During my childhood, she once told me that she overspent on Christmas presents and needed to borrow money, but made me promise not to tell Dad.\n\nOver the last 10 years since my parents divorce, I have loaned family members close to $15k (not repayed) to cover living expenses. Aside from my sister practicing law for a year, few of my family members have attempted to work much. My mother says she is 1) too old to get a job and 2) will lose her state health insurance if she finds work.\n\nTo make ends meet, my mother, sisters husband, and my 3 siblings routinely enroll in online degree programs to get student loans. After years of seeing this, I\u2019m starting to conclude that they treat it as income. My mother\u2019s perspective sounds more innocent though. After all, I went to college and got a good career. Why shouldn\u2019t they?\n\nTwo years ago, my sister almost died but received a heart transplant. She couldn't afford the bar fees and lost her law license. After recovery, she decided that she didn't want to return to family law and instead enrolled in a postgraduate tax law program. She graduated nearly top of her class, but didn\u2019t work during that period. She found a local rental assistance nonprofit that kept a roof over her families head, but they've recently closed down.\n\nTwo months ago, my sister borrowed \\~$1000 from me to get her law license reinstated, but last week she informed me she was 3 months behind on rent and facing eviction.\n\nThe pattern is now worryingly clear to me. Most of my family members play \u201cfinancial chicken\u201d. I'm worried of continuing to sacrifice my future by enabling their behavior. I've literally lost count how many times I've heard the story that \"X student loan is delayed and family member Y can't afford rent.\"\n\nAs a compromise, I offered my sister to pay for the backrent in exchange for \"job applications\", proving that her and her husband have looked. She told me that she was waiting to get her law license reinstated from the bar before starting.

However, her health issues didn\u2019t rattle her husband to scare his ass enough to consider if his wife dies, he needed a way to live. You have zero obligation to him, so he should have considered the future more closely. If they have been using student loans to fund them, what have they done with the money if rent is due for several months plus those loans will eventually need to be paid back. Furthermore, you have not received even a token repayment from one of them. Regarding your mother, I am sure that she can find some work that will be below a threshold in order to keep her state insurance. If she is on social  security she can make up to $18k a year without having her ss check stopped. If she is 65, she can get Medicare. Even if she didn\u2019t work and she stayed married to your father for 10 years she can claim ss benefits from his work.

Maybe there are some backpay issues, but generally that\u2019s nowhere near the full amount of dues.

It\u2019s not your responsibility to bail them out. Don\u2019t let them guilt you. They are adults, they made their bed. Let them lie in it. You have to take care of yourself first; you know they won\u2019t help you out if you were to need it.", "Oh yeah. She 100% ran through the ERAP dollars, and now that's all dried up. She probably got 10's of thousands of dollars through that.", "Ok. This changes the conversation you have with your parents. You may not be in debt like they are, but you are not cash solvent either. Just tell them you are broke. \"I don't have the money to give you\"\n\nYou could even throw in a \"I would if I could but I don't have it\"\n\nBecause it's true. You don't have that money to spend on them. You have a job to do, and that's to save money for your future!!", "I get what you're saying, but if she had little income, I just really have a hard time seeing how she'd get approved.  I've had a double lung transplant and am currently listed for a kidney and just did my evaluation.  There is an entire consultation with a finance coordinator to go over how expensive transplant can be and the costs of staying local to the hotel for 6 weeks plus meds after. They won't just take a chance on someone. They want the organ to go to someone who will take medicine consistently and not have to skip or limit doses because they can't afford the meds. How is she currently paying for the meds? Doesn't sound like she has insurance? The meds with insurance can be 200/month sometimes.  The general public doesn't understand that your financial standing is very much a part of your ability to receive a transplant in America.", "Maybe send them a Dave Ramsey book or something", "It's such a tragic healthcare system we find ourselves in, and I'm sorry to hear that you've gone through such troubles yourself. I can't imagine what its like.\n\nIt will probably anger you to hear this, but my sister is on Oregon state healthcare. They completely covered everything. I was astonished, as someone who has been working for a decade and paying my own insurance premiums. I don't think she had to pay for any of it.\n\nSeeing her go through that and not have to pay a dime kinda made me wish I could just be unemployed and take the free state healthcare, but the downsides of not having a stable income are far too burdensome.\n\nIts really unfair. If I needed that transplant, even with my insurance, it would have financially buried me. Everyone in America should have that socialized medical care IMHO. If anything, her illness almost killed her, but it did NOT kill her bank account apparently. She did that on her own.", "Doesnt anger me. I am surprised. When I was disabled and on Medicare, I had to have private insurance in addition to medicare since Medicare only covered 80% and that can be crazy expensive with transplant costs being over a million most of the time. I wasn't on medicaid though which is income based to receive. I have never heard of a center transplanting people without some form of private insurance though even with government aide. It's not secure either bc it is income based there's a chance she could work but lose some or all of her help, and potentially not have a job that has insurance available. That's so risky for transplant centers.\n\nHow the heck is a working lawyer on income based aid though? I've been on aide before and it's not a comfortable life style imo.  I was barely making it, because my only income was ssdi payments which were about 600-700/month.", "I've been told that starting a private practice was just not pulling in that much cash. She was taking in low-income clients. They called her at all hours of the day to complain about their cases, many of which were divorces.\n\nI remember one client calling her in the hospital asking for gas money. It's no wonder she decided to move away from family law after she recovered. F that. Too much drama I guess.\n\nI have no idea how my sister ran her private practice, but if shes anything like me, she was probably too charitable with her clients. I can empathize, but the giving up on working entirely is problematic."]}
