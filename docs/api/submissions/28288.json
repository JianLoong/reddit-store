Rob was rude from the offset, told me he didn\u2019t like my new haircut, my arrangements are excessive and that Hannah would NEVER get a flower cloud \u201cIF\u201d they got engaged. He complained about the attire, refused to wear a shirt despite Hannah offering to iron. I asked what time they\u2019d be arriving, they said 7.30pm because Rob likes to chat after the football, then there\u2019s getting changed and driving. I joked that he skip the football for 1 day (he goes every weekend and watches EVERY match on tv) he asked why would he\u2019d that? I said because it\u2019s my engagement party and he looks me dead in the eye and said \u201cand I don\u2019t care?\u201d. No laugh, just a shrug. I said he should be more supportive of his girlfriend and she said nothing. Later in the car I asked her to be my bridesmaid, she said she wouldn\u2019t have been offended if she hadn\u2019t been chosen bc she knows I wouldn\u2019t take it personally if she didn\u2019t pick me bc its just one of those things. I awkwardly agreed. I went on to say I felt Rob had been a bit rude, if he doesn\u2019t care he doesn\u2019t have to come and I\u2019m not v happy with them being 3 hours late. She excused him, said it\u2019s \u201cbanter\u201d, he didn\u2019t mean it, he was trying to wind me up\u2026 she then tells me that the plans she can\u2019t get away from are a small town football club match and he does the live Twitter updates for. \n\nI get home and tell my fianc\u00e9 who\u2019s livid and says Rob\u2019s no longer invited, he\u2019s rude and was only Hannah\u2019s +1 anyway. I know he\u2019s right and is saving me the upset of Rob making a dig at the party. I text Hannah and say, I know this is awkward, I\u2019m really upset about what was said earlier and I think it\u2019s best Rob sits this one out. I love you, I hope you understand and still want to be involved. She responds to say that this would have been sorted if I\u2019d just brought it up at the house, it was only banter, I\u2019m being unfair by banishing her baby\u2019s father and have put her in a terrible position and that she has to choose between us, if they can\u2019t all come together then she won\u2019t be coming either. \n\nHe text me but I didn\u2019t respond because I was busy. Next day she text to say she\u2019d sit it out with Rob. I told her she can sit out the rest of the events and the wedding in that case, essentially ended our friendship over this idiot.

You're just his wife's friend, so his  yea he values his plans with his plans more than your big moments. \n\nYou should be asking why does someone you been close to over a decade wouldnt just show up on time and have her partner meet her there.  Him showing up late is understandable her on the other hand is where you should realize there's an issue", "For context:\n\nMy best friend (Hannah) has been one of my closest friends since we were 16. I didn\u2019t really start to open up deeply to Hannah about my family issues or relationship bits until I went to therapy in 2019, she is sensitive in nature and so i really valued someone who respected my emotions during that time. This said, Hannah and I have had one previous argument about 5/6 years ago. She had a birthday party and didn\u2019t invite me, I found out about it on ig bc one of her other friends posted pictures. When I asked her, she said it wasn\u2019t personal, it was down to numbers because her parents\u2019 dog gets nervous with so many people. I let it go and we moved on but I noticed there were many things she would discreetly not invite me to, brunches with her other girlfriends etc. she would however heavily rely on me when things went wrong or she was upset. Hannah has previously struggled with her mental health and again, I learned about her condition and did my best to support her in the way she told me she needed. Our relationship has felt quite one sided to me and this is something all of my other friends have pointed out over the years, I loved her regardless and just chalked it down to me not being highly expressive emotionally and her being on the sensitive side. \n \nIn late 2019 she got with a guy (Rob). He regularly invalidated her feelings, shouted at her for crying over very rational situations, was rude to her and made unkind jokes at her. He\u2019s made some improvements since they got together, she loves him and excuses his behaviour as he\u2019s \u201clearning and changing\u201d. I keep my opinions to myself because I don\u2019t want to upset her. They\u2019ve had a baby and bought a house together but she still consoling to me about him every month or so. \n\nAlso bit of info, I was feeling really sad at the beginning of the year (I kept it to myself mostly) but all of my friends have had children, including my sister and have bought houses or done other grown up things. I was told I might not be able to have children at all, and was TTC a few years back and failed, which at the time really broke my heart. This engagement, to the man I\u2019m with is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me and Hannah knows this and knows how important this all is for me, it\u2019s the one milestone I can partake in, whereas the baby stuff might never happen for me and it\u2019s been difficult for me to watch everyone have something I might not ever experience. Not that I want one right now and I\u2019ve made it super clear that I\u2019m soooo happy for them all, just can be hard on myself about my own body, that\u2019s all.", "NTA it sounds like your friend is in an abusive relationship, hard as it is if she doesn\u2019t want to help herself it\u2019s better to distance yourself from the boyfriend and explain to her why.", "NTA.

I'm sorry for your loss of friendship", "NTA.  \n\nIf you can't get her away from Rob, it is better to remove them from your life.", "NTA. It sucks for your friend but she\u2019s gonna let this asshole isolated her from a lot of other people and you are (potentially) just the start. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, a bestie break up hurts like no other.", "NTA, but don't close the door on your friend.  Her bf sounds like he is trying to isolate her, a strong indication that he is abusive.  Your friend may need your support down the road, because her relationship with this guy could go down in flames.  Hope she doesn't get hurt.", "NTA . Are you okay ending your friendship over this? \n\nIf so, then great! Move on with other people in your life. If you\u2019d like to still have her as a friend, then possibly you didn\u2019t handle this in the best way.  Because she can\u2019t make it to an engagement party she\u2019s out of your life? Seems like an emotional decision.", "NTA.  I've never heard verbal abuse being called banter.", "So you spend what sounds like years never speaking your mind about Rob in order to keep the peace, but then your engagement party comes along and you use that to suddenly do a 180?\n\nYou are not a huge a-hole, but you are most definitely inconsistent and by letting all of your pent-up annoyance, dislike, and anger toward Rob and your friend's enabling of his behavior by excusing it erupt in volcano-like proportions, shows that you are not a \"pro-active\" type person.  \n\nAt this point, you have three choices:\n\n1. Move on and accept that your friend is no longer in your life, and with that, neither is Rob.\n2. Apologize, and re-invite them to all events, without any expectations, and with the knowledge that they may not accept the apology.  If, however, they accept the apology and reconnect and she is to be one of your bridesmaids, and she shows up an hour late to the wedding, then have contingency plans and don't let it ruin your day.\n3. Apologize, re-invite them to everything, but mention that given the geographic distance and Rob's needs, maybe being a bridesmaid is too much for her . . . in other words, as graciously as possible, give her an out.  If she still presses to be in your wedding, then get her assurances that she will not be late, and do so with a witness.  But again, have a back-up plan if she is late or a no-show, so that your day is not ruined.", "It\u2019s your choice, but she is certainly in a no win position.

Your argument isn\u2019t with her as you well know.", "Your friend will need you, when she finally develops the spine to leave her abusive boyfriend. In the meantime, try to cut her some slack; it's really hard for some people to admit to themselves that they're entire relationship is a terrible mistake.\nYou're NTA, but please let her know you'll be there for her.", "YTA.

I believe you need to take a break from your friendship with Hannah.  Sometimes we need to step back in order to see things clearly and make a better evaluation of our relationships with people and if that relationship truly benefits us in anyway.  It sounds like Hannah is a user of you and doesn\u2019t appreciate what you did for her as her sounding board.

I think my snap reaction is the reason I could be TA tbh. With everything else that\u2019s happened and how much this means to me, I was really hurt. It wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t come, she chose not to for Rob\u2019s sake. Whether I want to continue being friends\u2026 not while she\u2019s with Rob I don\u2019t think.

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll forgive him for being so rude, or maybe even her for allowing it. Idk, I feel torn and sad about it all.", "Completely agree with your options for moving forward! Thank you, they\u2019re helpful to read! \nJust for clarity\u2019s sake, at first I told her I didn\u2019t like him, that she deserved better and that she shouldn\u2019t allow this guy to treat her this way but she continued to stay with him and I noticed each time she would confide in me and I would tell her what I thought, she grew more upset so I stopped telling her I didn\u2019t like him. Probably over the last three years I\u2019ve stuck to more impartial comments, like, I\u2019m glad he eventually came around, or I can\u2019t believe he did x, y, z but I\u2019m really proud of you for standing up to him and saying you deserve to be heard etc. I just left my personal feelings towards him out of it. I\u2019d never be rude to him in person or continue to tell her I don\u2019t like him because she does, and that\u2019s what matters. Hopefully that makes a bit more sense \ud83d\ude0a", "I understand what you\u2019re saying. Like I said to her, I get that this is difficult and idk what Rob\u2019s input has been so idk what\u2019s going on for her at home. She said she could come up beforehand and for Rob to meet her there later so unsure why it needed to be an ultimatum between all or nothing, particularly after he was so rude to me in front of her. I was really deeply hurt about her lack of care, especially after how she\u2019s been previously with me. If she\u2019s given me all or nothing now and I decided to not invite him to the wedding, it\u2019d be more of the same. I know it might sound extreme but I\u2019ve always been a second priority for Hannah despite how much I\u2019ve been there for her and tbh I was just angry, upset and tired of it. I also do see where you\u2019re coming from and I agree, depending on his response could be in a no win situation, which is sad. I take your comments on board", "Don\u2019t you think when a \u2018best friend\u2019 shows they\u2019re not willing to prioritise you on one of your most important life events that feeling betrayed is a natural consequence?", "But nothing here says he's telling her she can't go without him or that he controls her actions. Says he says rude things which yes is abusive but I think that's part of the problem that it's automatically not her fault it's all his. \n\nWhat I'm saying is this person isn't being a good friend. They are choosing not to be a good friend over an asshole. Tbh at some point OP needs to ask why continue to be a friend to someone who is not a friend to me.", "Seems fair.  Even though the decision was emotional and made in haste, sounds like it was a long time coming.\n\nIf you want to leave the possibility of things for the future you could reach out to Hannah and say you love her,  but you can\u2019t continue being her friend while Rob\u2019s around.  Likely the end result is the same and she won\u2019t be open to any criticism of her child\u2019s dad,   but the door is slightly cracked open for the future if anything changes.", "Yes, that clarity helps and am glad you tried to warn her.  Unfortunately, when people are in this type of behavior and so easily under another person's thumb, it is very difficult for them to see the truth in your insight.  Your friend likely has very low self-esteem and a fear of being alone.  She probably won't even think about leaving until she witnesses Rob's terrible behavior affecting her child.  It's sad, but a pretty typical thing.\n\nBest of luck with your wedding.  And definitely have a backup plan.  He sounds like the type of guy to purposefully sabotage whatever part of your day that he can.", "I think there\u2019s a difference between being offended and hurt that OP\u2019s friend would be hours late to the engagement party because friend and her SO is joined at the hip and OP escalating to uninviting the friend from the engagement party, from any showers, from the wedding and the reception.  The lateness would be *rude* but a \u201cbetrayal\u201d?  tbh, it looks to me like the fianc\u00e9 took an opportunity to stir up trouble between OP and her best friend.", "Tbh I think you\u2019re right and this is exactly what my partner has said. Rob wasn\u2019t important to me and whether he cares or not isn\u2019t really an issue for me, it\u2019s that she has excused his behaviour and chose to not partake too. Idk if she ever really cared", "That\u2019s really true. After it all, 15 years is a long time and we\u2019ve been through a lot together. Thank you for your input, I appreciate it", "NTA. I don't think that's what banter means. Poor Hannah.", "Well\u2026 none of y\u2019all seem friendly with each other. \n\nHannah isn\u2019t invested in spending time with you right now. Maybe it\u2019s new baby sleep deprivation, maybe you\u2019re growing apart as people, maybe you annoy her, but she doesn\u2019t seem like TA. So she was late yo a party? And doesn\u2019t care if Rob doesn\u2019t care? She\u2019s allowed to have her own life.  Not TA. \n\nRob seems blunt and sarcastic but not TA for wanting to focus on something else besides you. \n\nYou are the bride and focused correctly on the important things that you need to do, which includes finding people who care and can be timely to be in the wedding party, which these two aren\u2019t. You are also Not TA.\n\nTherefore the only thing I can vote for is NAH, weddings are stressful, babies are stressful, everyone has stress to work through here and hopefully will get together again in five years and laugh over how personally y\u2019all took things.", "I just hope that their relationship isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds, by unfriending Hannah you potentially could have left her floundering in an abusive relationship with no bestie to reach out to. If he\u2019s that rude and obnoxious to you, what is he like with her and the baby? I\u2019m scared for Hannah now, if she\u2019s the victim of a controlling, potentially violent man who is gonna be there for her when the shit hits the fan?", "NTA\nBut it does sound like Hannah is in an abusive controlling relationship so that could explain her reluctance to go against her bf. You won't be able to help her unless she wants help.", "NTA.\n\nBut, please, make sure you don't end the friendship over this. You have every right to be upset. I do think you were right to having him uninvited. I do think you should do the same for your wedding. I do think you should tell her that her being a bridesmaid might be to much for her right now, her having a baby and all. But, please, make sure that you don't close any doors. Tell her you'll be there for her if she needs you, if she needs any help. Because, the way you describe it, he's abusing her. I'm not all that sure, but there are for sure a lot of red flags in that relationship. So, if you care about her, make sure she'll contact you if she needs any help to get away from him.  She might need this one day.\n\nIf I'm right and she's being abused, she's still in that \"but he can be so nice!\"-phase of their relationship. It might be that she'll never contact you about this, but don't close that door all too fast. I'm not talking about her usual \"he's so bad!\", but about her \"I can't take this anymore, can you help me?\"\n\nAs for him? Block him. He's not worth any of your time.\n\nEDIT: Just read a few of your comments how she excluded you from things. How she would not invite you on separate occasions. That changes a lot of things. While I stand by my point on not closing that door, I have to admit that sometimes people enjoy that strange kind of relationship. I had to end a friendship with a woman I'd known for the bigger part of my life. Her partner would verbally abuse her when drunk, even when we - me, my husband, our friends - were around. We would usually meet once or twice a year for an extended weekend somewhere, and it always was the same. We would try to protect her. It always ended with him going to bed, her sleeping in one of our rooms, claiming she would file for divorce the very next morning. And we always, always woke up in a different reality where both of them would be in the kitchen, making breakfast for everyone, cuddling the hell out of each other. Her only defense always was \"oh, that's him!\" After the third or fourth incident - and my parents claimed I was a fast learner, go figure - I just did not care anymore. The interesting part was, she was the breadwinner. The successful one. Almost then years younger than him, attractive (he? not so much). And still. When he passed, she turned his death into something magical. Like, when he passed she felt his soul going up or so. I should remark that I lost my husband a few years before her, so my patience was a little... stretched, but she managed to drive all of us friends (minus two really patient ones) away within a year.", "NTA. She straight up told you she wouldn't ask you to be her bridesmaid in return.  It doesn't seem to be a reciprocal friendship.", "I would text her that its clear she's in a abusive relationship and that if she wants help your willing. But if she's gonna chose to stay then your going cut contact. But you think its sad that your friend would do that to herself.", "NTA. I feel weird saying this but if your friend wants to live her life attached to an AH, there\u2019s very little you can do. It\u2019s not realistic for you to give him a hall pass to say and do whatever he wants because it\u2019s \u201cjust banter.\u201d She is unable or unwilling to do anything about it. She isn\u2019t going to see the need to make a change until she has to and maybe this situation will give her the push she needs. However, if it doesn\u2019t, be ready for that too.", "This is a tough one.   \n\n\nYou absolutely have a right to not have someone abusive at your wedding. \n\nAt the same time, your friend is right that it puts her in a tough place between you and her partner, and it is reasonable for her to not come if her partner has been uninvited. I would never consider going to an event my partner had been uninvited to, even if just to support. \n\nSince the question seems to be between you and her ...  \nNAH \n\nexcept her boyfriend. He sounds like a real asshole.", "NTA. Even taking her boyfriend out of the equation, she is not a friend anymore. I was friends with someone like that, and they routinely impacted my mental health negatively and would use me for emotional support but were never there for me. You are allowed to put yourself first even if you think this friend might not be in the best situation in her relationship, she has proven time and time again that she does not value you or put in as much effort as you in your friendship, many times prior to her dating this person. Do not feel bad or guilty about ending this relationship that didn't benefit you as much as it so clearly benefitted her, focus on your upcoming big day and spending time with those you love, and those who value and respect you as much as you do them. Congrats by the way!1", "I guess I\u2019m looking for where you have any evidence that this friendship *isn\u2019t* one-sided. It really doesn\u2019t seem like this woman likes you very much - you\u2019re just a willing receptacle for her messy side, which she likes to keep separate from the people she actually wants to be around.", "I figured most of this when you said she made a comment about not being offended if you didn't ask her to be a bridesmaid. You would never ever be asked to be her bridesmaid. It would come down to \"numbers\". She'd use you for errands while she partied with her real friends. \n\nLet this one go, she's not a friend.", "That would be really sad imo", "My partner has said this to me, that he doesn\u2019t think she ever actually liked me. it breaks my heart. Hannah and I are quite different characters but I\u2019ve only ever done my best to be there for her so I can\u2019t understand why that would be", "That stuff is never said in front of people.  That stuff goes on behind closed doors.   \n You can tell by the fact that she is making excuses for a verbally abusive person who she probably feels stuck with even more now that they have a baby.  His tactics are isolating her from her friends.  That is what abusers do.  Makes it all that much easier to control someone who has no friends.  Not saying OP should invite him to anything, but keeping a line open so the friend knows OP can be contacted if the friend needs help would be kind.", "Some people are just like that. There\u2019s nothing you can do, no amount of listening and caring and supporting and *giving* that you can do that will inspire them to return your affection. They\u2019ll keep you around, obviously, because you\u2019re just so eager to please, and sometimes that\u2019s useful. But they don\u2019t *like* you. And the harder you try to win them over, the less they respect you, and the worse they\u2019ll treat you.", "It may be different for you, but when I was younger and feeling bad about myself, I often mistook people trauma-dumping on me as a sign of their trust in me/friendship. It took me a long time to realize that with true friends, it goes both ways, and they will take the time to listen and uplift you as well instead of just depending on you to carry their burdens. Now that I have real friends, it's amazing the difference it makes. You are worthy of being treated with kindness and respect.", "You're missing that this isn't the first time she treated OP less than a friend and the other time she mentioned was before she dated this guy. And even OP agreed with me saying that she doesn't believe this person was ever a true friend.  \n\nSo yea this guy may be an asshole but truthfully sounds like the \"friend\" may be one too. And I'm mainly saying that due to OP agreeing", "Well said! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "Look, your \"friend\" sounds almost as bad as her bf. She's using you to whine and sob to and doing the fun stuff with the people she actually seems to care about. You're a poor second in her friendship levels. Honestly it seems like her and her boyfriend deserve each other. Move on, cut her off and surround yourself with people who actually care about you and will show that they do. She's no loss. NTA."]}
