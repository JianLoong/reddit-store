She got w her boyf (Rob 31M) the same year as I got w my fianc\u00e9. She routinely complains about how inconsiderate and insensitive Rob is. She\u2019s a sensitive person so he really can be nasty though she mostly excuses it as \u201cbanter\u201d. I keep my opinions to myself bc I just want her to be happy and don\u2019t want to draw a wedge between us.\n\nWe sent out invites for our party, Hannah text to check the time, saying they\u2019d be late as Rob had plans but she might come up earlier with their baby, I said great and np!\nI went to see Hannah, Rob and the baby 3 days before the party. Rob was rude from the offset, told me he didn\u2019t like my new haircut, my arrangements are excessive and that Hannah would NEVER get a flower cloud \u201cIF\u201d they got engaged. He complained about the attire, refused to wear a shirt despite Hannah offering to iron. I asked what time they\u2019d be arriving, they said 7.30pm because Rob likes to chat after the football, then there\u2019s getting changed and driving. I joked that he skip the football for 1 day (he goes every weekend and watches EVERY match on tv) he asked why would he\u2019d that? I said because it\u2019s my engagement party and he looks me dead in the eye and said \u201cand I don\u2019t care?\u201d. No laugh, just a shrug. I said he should be more supportive of his girlfriend and she said nothing. Later in the car I asked her to be my bridesmaid, she said she wouldn\u2019t have been offended if she hadn\u2019t been chosen bc she knows I wouldn\u2019t take it personally if she didn\u2019t pick me bc its just one of those things. I awkwardly agreed. I went on to say I felt Rob had been a bit rude, if he doesn\u2019t care he doesn\u2019t have to come and I\u2019m not v happy with them being 3 hours late. She excused him, said it\u2019s \u201cbanter\u201d, he didn\u2019t mean it, he was trying to wind me up\u2026 she then tells me that the plans she can\u2019t get away from are a small town football club match and he does the live Twitter updates for. \n\nI get home and tell my fianc\u00e9 who\u2019s livid and says Rob\u2019s no longer invited, he\u2019s rude and was only Hannah\u2019s +1 anyway. I know he\u2019s right and is saving me the upset of Rob making a dig at the party. I text Hannah and say, I know this is awkward, I\u2019m really upset about what was said earlier and I think it\u2019s best Rob sits this one out. I love you, I hope you understand and still want to be involved. She responds to say that this would have been sorted if I\u2019d just brought it up at the house, it was only banter, I\u2019m being unfair by banishing her baby\u2019s father and have put her in a terrible position and that she has to choose between us, if they can\u2019t all come together then she won\u2019t be coming either. \n\nHe text me but I didn\u2019t respond because I was busy. Next day she text to say she\u2019d sit it out with Rob. I told her she can sit out the rest of the events and the wedding in that case, essentially ended our friendship over this idiot.

I explained my opinion of him is a result of what she tells me which is why I remain impartial.

You're just his wife's friend, so his  yea he values his plans with his plans more than your big moments. \n\nYou should be asking why does someone you been close to over a decade wouldnt just show up on time and have her partner meet her there.  Him showing up late is understandable her on the other hand is where you should realize there's an issue", "For context:\n\nMy best friend (Hannah) has been one of my closest friends since we were 16. I didn\u2019t really start to open up deeply to Hannah about my family issues or relationship bits until I went to therapy in 2019, she is sensitive in nature and so i really valued someone who respected my emotions during that time. This said, Hannah and I have had one previous argument about 5/6 years ago. She had a birthday party and didn\u2019t invite me, I found out about it on ig bc one of her other friends posted pictures. When I asked her, she said it wasn\u2019t personal, it was down to numbers because her parents\u2019 dog gets nervous with so many people. I let it go and we moved on but I noticed there were many things she would discreetly not invite me to, brunches with her other girlfriends etc. she would however heavily rely on me when things went wrong or she was upset. Hannah has previously struggled with her mental health and again, I learned about her condition and did my best to support her in the way she told me she needed. Our relationship has felt quite one sided to me and this is something all of my other friends have pointed out over the years, I loved her regardless and just chalked it down to me not being highly expressive emotionally and her being on the sensitive side. \n \nIn late 2019 she got with a guy (Rob). He regularly invalidated her feelings, shouted at her for crying over very rational situations, was rude to her and made unkind jokes at her. He\u2019s made some improvements since they got together, she loves him and excuses his behaviour as he\u2019s \u201clearning and changing\u201d. I keep my opinions to myself because I don\u2019t want to upset her. They\u2019ve had a baby and bought a house together but she still consoling to me about him every month or so. \n\nAlso bit of info, I was feeling really sad at the beginning of the year (I kept it to myself mostly) but all of my friends have had children, including my sister and have bought houses or done other grown up things. I was told I might not be able to have children at all, and was TTC a few years back and failed, which at the time really broke my heart. This engagement, to the man I\u2019m with is the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me and Hannah knows this and knows how important this all is for me, it\u2019s the one milestone I can partake in, whereas the baby stuff might never happen for me and it\u2019s been difficult for me to watch everyone have something I might not ever experience. Not that I want one right now and I\u2019ve made it super clear that I\u2019m soooo happy for them all, just can be hard on myself about my own body, that\u2019s all.", "NTA it sounds like your friend is in an abusive relationship, hard as it is if she doesn\u2019t want to help herself it\u2019s better to distance yourself from the boyfriend and explain to her why.", "NTA. Guy sounds like a mess and you set a boundary.", "NTA, but yikes! More red flags than a Soviet May Day parade from Rob. Don\u2019t let your friend be isolated by an abuser who needs to be put in his place.", "Nta. He's alienating her and she's allowing it in the worst way. I'm sorry for your loss of friendship", "NTA.  \n\nIf you can't get her away from Rob, it is better to remove them from your life.", "NTA. It sucks for your friend but she\u2019s gonna let this asshole isolated her from a lot of other people and you are (potentially) just the start. I\u2019m sorry for your loss, a bestie break up hurts like no other.", "NTA, but don't close the door on your friend.  Her bf sounds like he is trying to isolate her, a strong indication that he is abusive.  Your friend may need your support down the road, because her relationship with this guy could go down in flames.  Hope she doesn't get hurt.", "NTA . Are you okay ending your friendship over this? \n\nIf so, then great! Move on with other people in your life. If you\u2019d like to still have her as a friend, then possibly you didn\u2019t handle this in the best way.  Because she can\u2019t make it to an engagement party she\u2019s out of your life? Seems like an emotional decision.", "NTA.  I've never heard verbal abuse being called banter.", "So you spend what sounds like years never speaking your mind about Rob in order to keep the peace, but then your engagement party comes along and you use that to suddenly do a 180?\n\nYou are not a huge a-hole, but you are most definitely inconsistent and by letting all of your pent-up annoyance, dislike, and anger toward Rob and your friend's enabling of his behavior by excusing it erupt in volcano-like proportions, shows that you are not a \"pro-active\" type person.  \n\nAt this point, you have three choices:\n\n1. Move on and accept that your friend is no longer in your life, and with that, neither is Rob.\n2. Apologize, and re-invite them to all events, without any expectations, and with the knowledge that they may not accept the apology.  If, however, they accept the apology and reconnect and she is to be one of your bridesmaids, and she shows up an hour late to the wedding, then have contingency plans and don't let it ruin your day.\n3. Apologize, re-invite them to everything, but mention that given the geographic distance and Rob's needs, maybe being a bridesmaid is too much for her . . . in other words, as graciously as possible, give her an out.  If she still presses to be in your wedding, then get her assurances that she will not be late, and do so with a witness.  But again, have a back-up plan if she is late or a no-show, so that your day is not ruined.", "It\u2019s your choice, but she is certainly in a no win position. The fact that you extended the uninvite to all future related events seems extreme to me. Your argument isn\u2019t with her as you well know.", "Your friend will need you, when she finally develops the spine to leave her abusive boyfriend. In the meantime, try to cut her some slack; it's really hard for some people to admit to themselves that they're entire relationship is a terrible mistake.\nYou're NTA, but please let her know you'll be there for her.", "YTA.

I believe you need to take a break from your friendship with Hannah.  Sometimes we need to step back in order to see things clearly and make a better evaluation of our relationships with people and if that relationship truly benefits us in anyway.  It sounds like Hannah is a user of you and doesn\u2019t appreciate what you did for her as her sounding board.  Also we have to remember sometimes we internalize others struggles and cause them to effect us mentally without realizing it and once we take that step back from them we realize our mental/emotional state improves.", "I'm sorry but somehow it seems she's a taker not a giver. \n\nI wonder if she excluded you from all that stuff because she's jealous of you.", "I\u2019m ngl, it was an emotional reaction from me and it was definitely made in haste. I think my snap reaction is the reason I could be TA tbh. With everything else that\u2019s happened and how much this means to me, I was really hurt. It wasn\u2019t that she couldn\u2019t come, she chose not to for Rob\u2019s sake. Whether I want to continue being friends\u2026 not while she\u2019s with Rob I don\u2019t think. I just end up being the emotional dumping ground for her. Not to mention, his texts to me saying so what she didn\u2019t come to my \u201cglorified tea party\u201d but it\u2019s over now, that Hannah is better off without me, that I annoy her (not that I was told I had) and throwing the one argument my fianc\u00e9 and I ever had, three years ago, in my face as justification for his shitty behaviour to Hannah... I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll forgive him for being so rude, or maybe even her for allowing it. Idk, I feel torn and sad about it all.", "Completely agree with your options for moving forward! Thank you, they\u2019re helpful to read! \nJust for clarity\u2019s sake, at first I told her I didn\u2019t like him, that she deserved better and that she shouldn\u2019t allow this guy to treat her this way but she continued to stay with him and I noticed each time she would confide in me and I would tell her what I thought, she grew more upset so I stopped telling her I didn\u2019t like him. Probably over the last three years I\u2019ve stuck to more impartial comments, like, I\u2019m glad he eventually came around, or I can\u2019t believe he did x, y, z but I\u2019m really proud of you for standing up to him and saying you deserve to be heard etc. I just left my personal feelings towards him out of it. I\u2019d never be rude to him in person or continue to tell her I don\u2019t like him because she does, and that\u2019s what matters. Hopefully that makes a bit more sense \ud83d\ude0a", "I understand what you\u2019re saying. Like I said to her, I get that this is difficult and idk what Rob\u2019s input has been so idk what\u2019s going on for her at home. She said she could come up beforehand and for Rob to meet her there later so unsure why it needed to be an ultimatum between all or nothing, particularly after he was so rude to me in front of her. I was really deeply hurt about her lack of care, especially after how she\u2019s been previously with me. If she\u2019s given me all or nothing now and I decided to not invite him to the wedding, it\u2019d be more of the same. I know it might sound extreme but I\u2019ve always been a second priority for Hannah despite how much I\u2019ve been there for her and tbh I was just angry, upset and tired of it. I also do see where you\u2019re coming from and I agree, depending on his response could be in a no win situation, which is sad. I take your comments on board", "Don\u2019t you think when a \u2018best friend\u2019 shows they\u2019re not willing to prioritise you on one of your most important life events that feeling betrayed is a natural consequence?", "But nothing here says he's telling her she can't go without him or that he controls her actions. Says he says rude things which yes is abusive but I think that's part of the problem that it's automatically not her fault it's all his. \n\nWhat I'm saying is this person isn't being a good friend. They are choosing not to be a good friend over an asshole. Tbh at some point OP needs to ask why continue to be a friend to someone who is not a friend to me.", "Seems fair.  Even though the decision was emotional and made in haste, sounds like it was a long time coming.\n\nIf you want to leave the possibility of things for the future you could reach out to Hannah and say you love her,  but you can\u2019t continue being her friend while Rob\u2019s around.  Likely the end result is the same and she won\u2019t be open to any criticism of her child\u2019s dad,   but the door is slightly cracked open for the future if anything changes.", "Yes, that clarity helps and am glad you tried to warn her.  Unfortunately, when people are in this type of behavior and so easily under another person's thumb, it is very difficult for them to see the truth in your insight.  Your friend likely has very low self-esteem and a fear of being alone.  She probably won't even think about leaving until she witnesses Rob's terrible behavior affecting her child.  It's sad, but a pretty typical thing.\n\nBest of luck with your wedding.  And definitely have a backup plan.  He sounds like the type of guy to purposefully sabotage whatever part of your day that he can.", "I think there\u2019s a difference between being offended and hurt that OP\u2019s friend would be hours late to the engagement party because friend and her SO is joined at the hip and OP escalating to uninviting the friend from the engagement party, from any showers, from the wedding and the reception.  The lateness would be *rude* but a \u201cbetrayal\u201d?  tbh, it looks to me like the fianc\u00e9 took an opportunity to stir up trouble between OP and her best friend.", "Tbh I think you\u2019re right and this is exactly what my partner has said. Rob wasn\u2019t important to me and whether he cares or not isn\u2019t really an issue for me, it\u2019s that she has excused his behaviour and chose to not partake too. Idk if she ever really cared", "That\u2019s really true. After it all, 15 years is a long time and we\u2019ve been through a lot together. Thank you for your input, I appreciate it"]}
