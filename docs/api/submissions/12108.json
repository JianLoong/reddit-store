It\u2019s not your car, so you don\u2019t get to control the settings. Why should he have to check to make sure his automatic lights are on, when all you have to do is literally not touch it. Drive your own car if you can\u2019t respect his wishes. That solution would be best for everyone.", "YTA. I get you aren't doing it deliberately, and yes, he should check, but it his car, and really, you should be double checking yourself that you haven't turned them off automatically. Your solution is probably the best given the safety implications, though maybe you guys should take turns with where you park your cars.", "YTA.\n\nIt's ***his*** car.", "YTA\n\n\"He should pay attention to the settings\"\n\nNo. You shouldn't change HIS settings. Fuck around with your own car all you want, but this isn't yours and thus you shouldn't change shit. \n\nYou're putting the blame on him, for a situation you caused three times.. and all those situations were pointed out to you multiple times and still you didn't do anything. \n\nYta", " YTA. It is really funny how you say he needs to pay attention to the headlight setting when he is driving, when you are the one who keeps needlessly changing the setting.", "YTA. If you can't be cognizant of his property then don't touch them. Your solution is the best one. Stop using his car.", "Yes of course YTA, why would you not be TA? You're the one who should be paying attention to the headlight settings on someone else's car.", "YTA. Stop screwing with his headlights. It isn\u2019t that hard to just keep your hands off the controls.", "YTA. I absolutely despise the audacity of people changing things in my car- put the seat back where you found it and leave the settings on where they are (except heat/AC)", "Kinda YTA\n\nI wanted to N A H, but you kinda killed it for me when you said that he should start checking before he drives.  You can\u2019t adjust your behavior when you\u2019re borrowing his car, but you expect him to change his to accommodate you?!  That\u2019s some BS!", "YTA. \n\nBut this seems like a reasonable solution if you can't manage to not sabotage him.\n\n\"I offered is to just stop driving his car so there\u2019s no mixup\"\n\nDriving at night with no lights is not a minor inconvenience.", "YTA\n \nDon\u2019t change his settings.", "ESH/ you for Turing the lights off, him for being dramatic and also NOT paying attention to lights being off.

First of all, you didn't change this setting intentionally, it was only by mistake because of what you used to in your own car. \n\nAdditionally, when you start up your car, you are supposed to control all settings to make sure everything is in order. You probably also have to adjust mirrors, seat etc to make sure you can actually drive the car safely, so he would need to make sure everything is set the way he needs them anyway. \n\nHe is not the asshole for being a bit upset that you changed this setting, but may be for being mad at you (depending on whether shouting or yelling are involved or not). \n\nYour solution of only using your own car sounds fair, so just go with it.", "I guess I\u2019m going against the grain but I\u2019m going with NTA. Yeah it\u2019s his car but if he really really can\u2019t tell his lights are on at night and a flick of his wrist is too much then he has bigger issues. Sure be more mindful to his stuff but honestly nobody should be getting very mad over it unless you are doing it on purpose.", "Of course YTA! He told you that you did not fulfill his request. Really, you better not get behind the wheel of his car if you can't do what he asked you to do. It is not safe.", "YTA.

It wouldn't take much effort from you to return something that isn't yours back to the state that you borrowed it in. The fact that you not only won't change but are trying to undermine your bfs request shows your opinion.", "YTA, I get your pov but he asked you not to touch that", "YTA. You want him to pay attention but don\u2019t expect yourself to have to pay attention. It\u2019s his car.

Take your advice and don\u2019t drive his car no more.", "Yta, your suggestion is for your boyfriend to be careful and the same doesn't apply to you. Wow so great.", "YTA\n\nIf you change something in the car of someone else, just change it back at the end.", "YTA\n\nImagine similar situation: \"Dear reddit, my BF and I live in a house with a big yard. We've got a little dog Puffy. Puffy spends a lot of time in the yard. Th problem is, there is a gate in a fence. It should be closed because Puffy likes to try it and there is a busy street outside. But sometimes I forgot to close it and Puffy gets out. First time my BF asked me kindly to be more careful, but when it happened third time he was really mad. But I just don't remember to close it and I think I should not be bothered with it. If BF has a problem he should check gate every time he releases Puffy.\"\n\nWould it be ok?", "YTA his car, his settings. \n\nI think it's best you don't drive his car.", "YTA. \n\nIn spite of it being the result of genuine habit and that he should notice, it's his car and your messing with his settings is creating a problem for him.", "How dare you tell him that he needs to pay attention to his headlight settings when this problem only exists because you don't pay attention to the headlight settings YTA", "Habits die hard.  After owning a manual transmission car  I still clutch and reach to shift even though it's been years since that one died.  One thing that might help is a scrunchie on the light switch whenever you drive his car.  To remind you.  NTA You're only the ah if you don't try to find a way to break that habit.", "YTA its something you need to get into your head not to mess with the headlights when its set to auto and when its not your car. Just leave it alone or remind yourself not to touch it. Else just drive your own car. Your excuse of its manual in your car is flimsy as I am sure there are controls that are different between the two cars and all you have to do is to remind yourself not to touch the headlights or any of the settings. Lock the car and if the headlights are still on, you can do something about it or else just walk away.", "You don't touch them when you get in the car. So no reason to touch them when you get out of the car.", "YTA, how could you ever justify this to yourself?  And how old is your car that it doesn't have automatic headlights.  My mother's pre-1990 car had automatic headlights.", "I only have one question, OP.\n\nAre you the kind of partner that freaks out when your boyfriend doesn't put the toilet seat down after using it?\n\nBecause if you are, I've got some bad news for ya...", "YTA. I can understand it happening once out of pure habit, but after that it was up to you to find a way to remember to restore his settings.", "YTA\n\n\nIn what world is it overreacting if the boyfriend drives without lights at night because girlfriend couldn't bother to keep her hands off the settings? It is HIS car, HIS settings. You keep your hands off it.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t be changing the headlight settings on his car. Presumably the settings on his car look different/are in a different place than yours so I don\u2019t really buy the \u201cout of habit\u201d thing. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t be driving if he can\u2019t tell when his lights are on.", "YTA. there\u2019s zero reason for you to be touching his headlights, and after the first time he almost got in a crash you should very much have considered what was happening.\n\nhow in the **world** do you think it\u2019s okay that your muscle memory should trump his **in his own car!?**\n\nand for all the people saying \u201coh it\u2019s just like a manual transmission.\u201d no, absolutely not. manuals require changing into every gear every time you need to go somewhere; they are essentially stateless and their current status is easily noticeable by the driver. headlight settings, especially in modern cars, are not. don\u2019t fuck with your boyfriend\u2019s car and expect him to not be upset!", "YTA\n\nIf you can't remember to switch the lights back to auto then just stop using his car. He's asked you multiple times to stop messing with the settings. Once or twice is an honest mistake, 3 times is becoming a habit. Just use your own car.", "YTA - the one who needs to pay attention is you.  You are the one acting without stopping to think.  If you can bother to go through your post-drive checklist, you can manage to stay your hand when it goes for the headlights knob, or turn it to the automatic position.  Pay the hell attention to what you\u2019re doing.\n\nEspecially because it\u2019s happened multiple times.", "NTA. If he can\u2019t figure out if his lights are on or off - he shouldn\u2019t be driving at night period.", "NTA, I have the newer car in my relationship. When my partner drives it they\u2019ll, out of habit, turn the headlights off when they park. It only takes me pulling out of the driveway to realize my lights are off. Or looking at the dash and seeing the that my light indicator isn\u2019t on.\n\nIs it annoying? Yes. When I\u2019ve had a rough morning and running late does it really piss me off? Yes. Is it worth having an argument over? No.", "ESH.", "YTA\n\nYou strike me as someone who would bitch about the toilet seat too\n\nMy car has the indicator on the opposite side of the steering while, sounds insane but I just adapt when driving rather than expecting things to change\n\nNot your car, not your settings\n\nI bet you move the seat and mirrors too for a 2 minute drive", "I'm going against the trend. NTA\n\nYes, it's his car. But when he is driving it, he has to make sure everything is working properly, and the headlights are functioning. Technology has changed a lot, but it's OK for OP to change it to suit herself while she's driving if she doesn't trust the automated system.\n\nI think her offer to stop driving his car is a reasonable one. If he doesn't want her to change the settings, then she won't drive him when he's been drinking.", "NAH\nYou both lack situational awareness. You for turning the lights off, and him for not noticing the lights are off. Hopefully he never leaves your lights on and kills your battery in your car, or he\u2019s really going to have to eat some humble pie.", "YTA and so is your bf. It's a safety issue and HIS car. You need to leave his settings alone. By the same token he needs to check for the headlights especially now that he realizes that you're being inconsiderate.", "It\u2019s hard to say Y-T-A when you\u2019re clearly not doing something deliberately. It\u2019s a silly mistake, and you\u2019ve come up with the solution to just stop driving his car. This isn\u2019t asshole behaviour.\nAs far as your boyfriend is concerned IMO there\u2019s actually very few reasons to shout at your partner. It sounds like the words he was saying are valid but if he can\u2019t control his temper then that\u2019s not cool. Especially over something where there\u2019s no ill intentions and such an easy fix, as you\u2019ve already suggested.\nNTA", "NTA. You aren't trying to deliberately irritate him, and he still has a legal obligation to make sure his car is set up correctly before he starts driving.", "OYFG!! I don't know what bothers me most. That most of the people post YT because you desire basic safety or the fact that this demanding prick would rather disrespect you than just turn on the lights!! I suggest you run, not walk away from this supposed hero, he obviously doesn't have your best interest at heart. And shame on the misogynous posters who think putting a woman in place is better than keeping her safe!!", "NAH. But you need to solve this issue. It's dangerous. Just put some tape on the knob or something. It doesn't matter who or what, just get a solution that works. It's too dangerous to drive withought lights on.", "NTA. It\u2019s an honest mistake, and one that\u2019s very easy to make, especially if you don\u2019t often drive the car. My wife\u2019s car has this feature while mine doesn\u2019t, and I drive her car maybe three times a year, and do it every time without thinking. It\u2019s instinctual. Thankfully, she doesn\u2019t freak out about it like your boyfriend does.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s the driver\u2019s responsibility to ensure that their car is safe on the road.
