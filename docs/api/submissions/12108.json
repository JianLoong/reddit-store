It takes me about two seconds to realize that my headlights aren't on. \n\nI also don't understand why so many people are saying Y T A when she came up with the perfect solution... she just doesn't drive his car anymore.... Oh but he doesn't like that because it means he can't get drunk when they take his car! Like, she's doing him a favor by driving his drunk ass home... he can check the damn headlights.", "So glad to see another person with common sense", "So she shouldn\u2019t adjust the seat? The mirrors? Nothing? Those can all be considered \u201csettings.\u201d When you share a car with someone, you should expect to adjust some things. That\u2019s, like, common fucking sense. Every time you get in your car it SHOULD be a habit to check all of your setting to make sure your car is safest for you to drive. \n\nThe fact that people are arguing that he shouldn\u2019t have to check his settings is fucking insane. Yeah, it might be annoying. But it\u2019s part of sharing a car. If he doesn\u2019t like it, then he can just stop letting her use his car. It\u2019s that simple. This is such a stupid debate to begin with", "especially when she's doing him a favor by driving him home when he's drunk!", "My husbands 2009 car doesn\u2019t.", "No, he could get into a serious accident because he\u2019s too fucking stupid to make sure his lights are on, something every single driver is responsible for doing. If you can\u2019t do something as simple as checking to make sure your lights are on then you shouldn\u2019t be driving", "I use neon tiny post-it notes, they don't leave residue. I need a visual reminder or it won't ever happen.", "Or use a rubber band", "I frequently confuse my sink demon switch with the light switch. I've been pausing and repeat to myself \"right is the light.\" a few times before flipping the switch.", "well if she's mostly driving his car when he's too drunk to drive it, it makes sense that it's mostly at night.", "Yes, but if they are kind they move them back.", "tbh I have ADHD and muscle memory is incredibly difficult to change. It doesn't matter how many times I tell myself \"don't do the thing.\" I'm still going to do the thing. \n\nI actually think OP's solution of just not driving his car anymore is perfect....", "I'm not saying you're wrong, but it seems really stupid of car companies to forget about the back lights.  Maybe the cars you are seeing have their fog lights, or some other setting, on?", "I do this exact same thing whenever I drive an automatic, which is rarely. If I don\u2019t consciously tuck my left foot up I\u2019ll slam the brakes at least twice before I\u2019m out of the parking space.", "Muscle memory is fine and all but if you've been reminded multiple times, you know you're doing it. Muscle memory doesn't negate your brain memory and it's not difficult to remember \"I don't have to do this in this car\" that she's been driving often\n\nI can't think of a single muscle memory I have that can't be overridden with active attendance. She's either forgetting he told her to stop doing that or she's doing it deliberately\n\nEither way, she's also asking HIM to change his behaviour, which leans me even more into she's doing it deliberately because it's easier for HER not to change", "It is incredibly stupid on the manufactures part. All of my newer vehicles do it. I drive for a living as well, so does my husband in northern British Columbia. So lots of overcast days with blowing snow or fog for about six months out of the year. It blows my mind how many people don\u2019t turn their lights all the way on. Especially living in these weather conditions, you\u2019d think they\u2019d know better.", "My work truck is an automatic and my car is a manual. I drive both each day. The parking break in the truck is very close to where the clutch is in the car. It has caused a few mix ups.", "Worst thing for me was when work got a new van and nobody told me it had auto start stop. I pulled up to the first set of lights and the van just died. I was freaking out wondering why the van died. Until I touched the accelerator and it started again.", ">Muscle memory is fine and all but if you've been reminded multiple times, you know you're doing it.\n\nis this really true? I have ADHD and muscle memory takes over 100% of the time, lol. It must be so nice to be neurotypical.\n\nI have automatic headlights that come on when it's dark, but I'll sometimes have to switch them to \"on\" when it's raining out and then I forget to put them back on \"auto.\" When they're on \"on,\" they'll still turn off automatically when I stop the car, but they won't come back on in the dark unless they're set to \"auto.\"\n\nNo matter how much I tell myself \"okay, put them back on auto when you park. Put them back on auto when you park. Put them back on auto when you park.\" I never do, and I don't notice until the next time I'm driving at night and I can't see because my headlights are off....", "To be fair, my car is also automatic for the lights but there was a time I knocked it with my knee and I was driving with my lights off\n\nMy city is so bright with LED street lights and bright ass advertising that I didn't know until a few people were flashing me\n\nIf they're also in a bright night city, I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't notice either"]}
