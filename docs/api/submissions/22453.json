We all got together for her funeral, just really close family, and said goodbye to her.\n\nAt one point my sister in law came up to us and started to go on and on about how she knew how we felt because she had lost a child as well. I genuinely didn\u2019t know what she was talking about, and told her so. She said of course I knew what she was talking about, her baby that was miscarried at 21 weeks.\n\nShe did have to deliver the fetus after it had passed and they gave her a name and had a little mini funeral for her. None of us went to that (it happened at the hospital where she miscarried, wasn\u2019t an event for us to go to/ we were not invited). This was a couple years ago.\n\nI told her that she had not lost a child, she had a miscarriage and it\u2019s completely different, and she has no idea what we\u2019re going through. She got upset and said she was just trying to show empathy towards us and say she knew what we were going through. Eventually things escalated and I told her to get out (this was while eating lunch after the main funeral event).\n\nMost of my family thinks we were wrong to be upset and that she was just trying to empathize with us and that she really did lose a child too.

YTA. I suspect I'll get downvoted to hell for this, but you need to read this. \n\nLook, it's obviously not the same to give birth to a live baby and have that baby die. But that isn't the point. It's not close to the point. Your SIL considered the fetus inside her to be an actual child. She actually gave birth. Stillbirth. The two situations are not the same, but they are *very* comparable and more importantly they are ***both*** psychologically devastating. \n\nShe was thrown off of a tall cliff. You're throwing a fit because you were thrown off of a taller cliff. Guess what? The results are both crushing.\n\nYou told her that her pain was inferior to your pain. That was pointless. She was trying to empathize; you were trying to minimize. It's not a competition and your family are right to call you the AH for treating it like a competition. \n\nYou don't want to talk to her again until she admits she's wrong? She shouldn't be subjected to you until you admit that you were trying to make your pain superior and somehow \"win\". \n\nFFS, you've both been through something that nobody should have to go through. Why make it a competition?", "YTA. \n\nShe did not have a miscarriage, she had a still birth and yes, she lost a child. \n\nI realize you are grieving, but grief did not make you say what you did. Not respecting the loss of others did. Not being respectful of what women go through when they have to deliver a dead fetus did. You are using grief to justify cruelty.", "\"I don't want to talk to her again until she admits that her loss is not on the same level as ours.\"\n\nYeah. YTA.\n\nHer grief is just as real as yours, and just as valid. This isn't a competition for who is most deserving of sympathy, or who has suffered the most. On a fundamental level, she understands what it is like to grieve. Experiences don't have to be the exact same for empathy to exist.\n\nWith that being said, I'm sorry for your loss. No parent should ever have to go through this.", "YTA. She lost a child too. It\u2019s not a contest about whose experience was \u201cworse\u201d. You both suffered loss and grief. Both of you have valid feelings about your losses. You can both grieve and be supportive of each other and take her offer of empathy or you can alienate her. Which would you prefer?", "YTA.  100% b/c of  your final sentence.  You're demanding that \"she admits that her loss was not on the same level as ours, and that she cannot relate at all.\"\n\nGrief isn't a competition you effing asshole.", "I can\u2019t imagine the pain y\u2019all are going through but yeah YTA in this instance.

My mother had three miscarriages. She then carried to full term, John, who would have been my older brother but he passed away at 9 months old due to a heart condition. On the incredibly rare occasions my mum has talked about this to me she says she felt like she lost four children before I came along. It seems rather cold of you to treat her like she hasn't lost a child.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nYour loss is tragic and painful, but losing a baby at 21 weeks, at the point of viability, is a loss. That was a child who was loved and wanted. Comparing your traumas isn\u2019t going to bring either child back. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that you have had to do something no parent should ever have to do.", "YTA. I lost my son at 30 weeks. Followed by his sisters at 17 and 20 weeks. Until I was told that I would never be able to carry to term and that it was best to never try again. I was broken when I was told that and it took me years to recover from the news.\n\nDo you think that my loss is any less than yours? That I don't feel pain at never being able to hold my children or watch them grow up? If you do, then you're wrong. That is something that will follow me for the rest of my life. Just like it will follow your SIL and your wife. For which I give my condolences. But you don't get to minimize or discount another's pain in comparison to your own. Let alone tell them that their loss isn't the same. You just don't.", " YTA. \n\nIt might not ne the complete same but losing what\u2019s been with you 5 months, the preparation AND the aftermath isn\u2019t easy. \nI\u2019m sorry for your loss but your family is right she was trying to empathize.", "You're hurting but I wouldn't say downplaying her losing a child because she miscarried is not necessarily appropriate. 21 weeks is pretty far along, i have 2 kids and both had names, nursery items, outfits, etc by the time i was 21 weeks pregnant. It's a lot different for the woman than it is a man because the woman goes throw the whole process and its not easy growing another life. I was also already feeling kicking and depending on the music i listened to he would kick more. Its kinda like when people say \"if you have a c-section it doesn't count as giving birth\" its still giving birth you know? Just remember both of you lost a child who you expected to watch grow up. I can't imagine losing my kids and my heart goes out to you and your family. I'm so sorry for your lose and I hope everyone has alot of love and support.\n\nI do think you should apologize for downplaying what she went through and even though she was trying to help it just wasnt the right way in the moment. I'm being honest if someone said what you said to her to me I would be extremely heartbroken. She doesnt understand to have to watch her child be ill and pass away but she does know what its like to hold your child that just past away. To not be able to bring your baby home. She had to bury her child too, that should not be downplayed.", "YTA. She did lose a child.", "YTA. I'm sorry for your loss, but grief isn't a competition, and miscarriage is absolutely devastating. She shouldn't have to \"admit\" anything to you, she was just trying to empathize with you.", "YTA You didn't carry either of these children. No uterus, no opinion on SIL's feelings. I understand your hurting, but that no reason to dismiss the pain your SIL felt over her miscarriage, and what's even worse is that you basically dismissed your brother too. He probably feels like he lost a kid too, and you dismissed his feelings just as much as SIL. Instead of being a jerk, you could've just said thank you for being here, and left it at that.", "YTA sort of because .  Yours was horrible,  traumatic and heartbreaking\n\nSo was theirs in a different way.  \n\nIf you lose someone in a house fire , you can't tell a person  that lost someone in a car accident that it's not important.", "I don't think it's right to try and quantify pain and heartache. You both suffered great loss.\n\nPerhaps it wasn't the most sensitive, or the best moment, for her to share her story with you. But it was cruel of you to downplay what she went through. Miscarriages can be completely devastating.", "YTA- I think it\u2019s important to understand that nobody can understand your pain OR hers. I can see why it hit wrong but she\u2019s dealing with something very painful as well. You could have handled it better, although I see why you were in the frame of mind you were in. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "The problem stems from the belief that the age of a child at time of death determines the \"level\" to which grief happens/is valid.\n\nAs with any death, grief is a very individual process, an excruciatingly painful one that often makes us feel like we are alone, that no one can IMAGINE our pain, that we are somehow special in it.\n\nWe aren't. \n\nYour SIL lost her child at 21 weeks.\nAs someone who lost her son at 23 weeks, I can guarantee you it IS the loss of a child. Perhaps not to what your \"level\" definition of what a child actually is and whether someone deserves to grieve just as much as you do...but still a child.\n\nWe could get technical and say SIL carried/\"knew\" her baby longer than you knew yours. But THATs just petty.\n\nIsn't it.\n\nThis is not a competition.\nThis was an honest ..however may be it bungled...attempt to connect with you in your shared loss and unfortunately where you were in your grief at that moment didn't let you see it that way.\n\nSo yes you were the AH here.\nHijacking your sister in law to concede defeat in some kind of grief competition...is an AH move.\n\nCome together.\nYou may not believe it now but perhaps connecting with her in your shared losses will help you both heal.\n\nI'm sorry for all of your losses. May you find comfort in one another.", "YTA, gently. \n\nStarting at 20 weeks it's a stillbirth, not a miscarriage. Your sister had a stillborn baby. \n\nMy son is about to turn 2 and losing him would be unbearable. Had we lost him halfway through pregnancy it would also have been crushing. Yes, losing him now would be worse, but they're both horrific thoughts. Your loss was probably insanely triggering for bringing a freshness to your sister's loss, and she's hurting too. This is no time to be unkind. \n\nIt's not a grief contest. Let your sister grieve with you; it might bring you both some comfort and strength.", "Soft YTA.  \n\n\nFirstly, I want to express my deepest condolences for your loss. I can only imagine how devastating it must be to experience such a tragedy, and I want to send you healing thoughts during this difficult time.   \n\n\nThat being said, I would like to share my perspective as someone who has personally gone through the pain of two miscarriages. I believe it's crucial to recognize that the loss of a child through miscarriage is a profound and heartbreaking experience. A woman who has gone through this has not only endured physical and emotional pain but has also had to deliver a child she would never see alive. It's important to acknowledge that her baby mattered deeply to her, just as yours does to you. In times of grief, it's crucial to remember that this is not a competition, and each person's pain and loss should be respected.", "YTA for putting her down so much because *I cArRiEd My BaBy FuLl TeRm* grief is grief, she wanted to have a baby too, like, do you really not know what she\u2019s talking about?? However, I can see how you don\u2019t appreciate her approaching you cause this is your time to grieve. If you wanted support, you could\u2019ve talked to her (or anyone) instead of her talking to you. Everyone needs to individually process their own grief how they want to. Maybe instead being mean to her, recommend someone who can help her heal (& tell her to go see them immediately if you really need her out of your house) because women support women. Grief is not a competition.", "Yta you both lost a wanted child. That's devastating for both of you.", "YTA she lost a child and you cannot discount her grief. Everyone grieves differently and she was just trying to be empathetic and with you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for both your loses.", "Wow...\n\nWhy do you want that kinda karma on your life tho..just wow...grief isn't a competition", "YTA. Grief is not a contest! And she also lost a child.", "So sorry for both of your losses. Lost my first granddaughter at 18 days of age with heart issues. Our children and grandchildren should not go before us.\nYTA. Period.", "ESH Why is it important to compare levels of pain? She lost a child. You lost a child. If someone else\u2019s 3yo died, would you think you understood their pain? How about if their teenager died? \n\nI think it\u2019s always kind of an AH move to tell a grieving person that you know how they feel. I guess your SIL was trying to commiserate, but I think it comes off as self-serving.\n\nYou, though, don\u2019t get to measure her pain. The fact is, you don\u2019t know what losing a pregnancy at 21 weeks is like, and you don\u2019t know what it was like for her. Taking the position that your pain is bigger, worse, and more legitimate is an AH move.\n\nI am, however, profoundly sorry for your loss. I hope you are able to find comfort in the people around you who love you and grieve with you.", "I hesitate to call you an asshole\n\nquantifying grief does no good for anyone", "You want a public declaration that your SIL losing your niece/nephew wasn\u2019t as bad as her losing hers? \n\nDon\u2019t let grief destroy your life anymore with these ridiculous demands. This is the definition of empathizing and even if you didn\u2019t appreciate it at the time to degrade hers and demand she apologize for her holding the death of her child in the same regard is gonna make you the villain. \n\nYTA", "YTA and a ginormous gaping one. Also at 21 weeks it is a stillbirth not a miscarriage.", "YTA - this isn't the Olympics ;  you don't get a medal for this. I would never talk to you again if I were her.", "YTA. \n\nGrief is hard and you have suffered a terrible loss but what you said to your SIL is disgusting. \n\nSIL has nothing to apologize for.", "Major A hole! I lost my son at 22 weeks to a premature birth. If you have to give birth to the baby you've lost. Then it's baby loss, not miscarriage. When I lost my son, I was devastated, and the only people to see him alive were his father and I. You got to share your baby with others. When you don't get that chance because you have a still birth or the baby dies soon after birth. You also mourn the fact that you didn't get to share your living babies with others. Your SIL has every right to acknowledge her grief, and it doesn't make it any less valid than yours", "Wtf? Is this serious?? Yes you\u2019re a major asshole. Just because you got to meet your baby and show her the love she deserved before she passed doesn\u2019t make you anymore of a parent than your SIL. And you\u2019ll never know the pain of carrying a child feel it kick and hear it\u2019s heartbeat just to have to give birth to your precious child not breathing, and never see that baby smile up at you or hold your finger. At least you had a few months with your precious baby, she never got that. If anything you owe her an apology for being so rude when she was trying to empathize and be there for you. You suck.", "YTA. People bond over shared grief. There was no reason to reject her empathy. Jesus Christ.", "YTA.\nI\u2019m hoping it\u2019s the trauma of what you are still dealing with that made you behave in such a cruel manner.\nThe death of a child through any means is NOT A COMPETITION. \nHer loss is valid and you don\u2019t need to invalidate her experience.", "YTA, yeah saying that she knows how you feel isn't the best wording because we never truly understand how someone is feeling while they are grieving.\n\nHer loss was just as valid because she went through things and feelings that you and your spouse didn't have to go through and vice versa. \n\nBut the problem here is you diminished her loss to the equivalent of losing something irrelevant like a chapstick. I am sorry for your loss.", "YTA. Just because you don't know how they took it. If they have been trying everything to get pregnant, it hurts when you are lucky enough and get excited for it all to be taken away after a couple of months. They may have thought that was one and only hope. Personal experience. Fortunately for us, we got lucky after another 8 years.", "YTA. Grief is grief and losing a child at any age is hard for anyone. Diminishing your SIL\u2019s pain is the wrong thing to do and expecting an apology from her for trying to empathize with you is a tragic way of handling the situation. If you have the resources, I strongly recommend seeking counseling to grapple with your grief, partly because it seems you\u2019re lashing out at your SIL. After my wife and I (40M) lost our first child we both went to therapy and for me it helped process the grief and anger I was feeling at the time. \n\nI truly hope you and your SIL find a way to move past this incident. You\u2019ve both suffered so much already and can support each other in ways few other people can.", "YTA.\n\nYou sound blinded by your dislike of her, so you're unable to see the clear similarities: You both clearly wanted these children, both named them (I assume you did at least since she lived for three months), both held funerals for them.\n\nI know you dislike your SIL but it does sound like she was trying to empathise, and because you don't like her, you blew up at her because you don't want to have anything in common with her. Just seems like she was an easy target for your anger because you already didn't like her.\n\nIf she had miscarried and NOT wanted the child, THAT would be vastly different. But does that sound like the case to you, when she named and had a funeral for her child?\n\nI'm not saying you have to like your SIL, but telling someone the loss of their dead child doesn't matter as much or wasn't as bad as the loss of your dead child is AH behaviour dude. \n\nYou and your wife should know that a child means the world to their parents, and to your SIL, that fetus was her child. She was in the second trimester and miscarriages later on in the pregnancy are rare, so she was likely excited about having her kid and then she lost her child mid-pregnancy. \n\nAre you saying you wouldn't have been as devastated if you had lost your little girl mid-pregnancy instead of 3 months after birth? A lot of people find miscarriages soul-breaking when they occur after 12 weeks. Having to deliver a dead fetus, or have a stillborn child is very traumatic. \n\nMaybe you think she had it easier because it happened before the child was born but newsflash: it is never easy when a wanted, desired, loved, child dies at any stage. Whether it is a miscarriage, a stillbirth, or death later on, losing a child you love and want to have around, is a tragic loss for parents, with different reasoning at every stage because you always crave more time with them, to have seen them do more things, to learn, to grow, to thrive.", "NTA. Absolutely not. And just fyi, I had a late term miscarriage. It's horrible but not the same. Not even close to having a child dying. Everyone who is saying differently hasn't been there. So sorry for your loss.", "YTA \nthis isn\u2019t a grief battle, it\u2019s not about who went through \u201cworse\u201d, you both lost a child. you both went through what had to of been an incredibly difficult time and you\u2019re completely diminishing her experience just because you don\u2019t like her.", "YTA. While your loss and her loss were different, you both experienced the loss of a child that never got to grow up. It is totally unnecessary to compare who's loss was \"worse.\" Many people attempt to show empathy by trying to relate to the pain someone is experiencing and I believe that is what she was doing here. While it wasn't identical, it was a somewhat similar situation. \n\nYou get a little slack because you lost your child which is a terrible tragedy and I cannot imagine the pain you must be feeling but driving a wedge in your family until she \"admits\" her loss wasn't the same isn't going to do anything but make the situation worse. \n\nYou took a moment where someone was trying to say something sympathetic in a very difficult situation and created an awkward situation for your whole family who also experienced and are grieving the loss of your child. \n\nPlease put this behind you and focus on grieving the loss of your child which is the only thing you should be focused on, not petty nonsense.", "YTA 100%.

I am also sorry to say YTA.\nYou both lost someone precious to you,but not only that,  you both lost the dreams of the life you imagined with your respective children.  At 21  weeks,  she felt her child move,  she might have known the sex, picked out names,  was excited to hold her baby and see her child.  She was robbed of that.  She had to deliver a dead baby,  going through the pain of childbirth and grieving her loss at the same time.  Knowing that her child was already gone.  You got to kiss and hug and love your baby for a few precious months.  If your child had died at birth would you have grieved less?  because you didn't \"know\"  your child yet?  I don't think so.  You owe her an apology.", "Firstly, I am sorry for your loss.\n\nSecondly, ESH. \n\nShe never got to hold her child, only it\u2019s corpse. \n\nYou got to hold your child, but you also had to watch your child suffer and knowing there was nothing you could do to help her get better.\n\nI cannot, and frankly will not, even begin to try to imagine the pain and complete heartbreak in either of those nightmare situations. \n\nBut sweetie it\u2019s not the pain Olympics. There is no competition, no winners, only losers left with their loss. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have brought up her own pain like that, it was crass. And you should not have belittled her pain. So yes ESH.", "YTA. \n\nYour grief, as profound as it is, doesn\u2019t give you a right to be so cold and rude. \n\nYou can hold boundaries. You can say \u201cI\u2019m not in a space yet where I\u2019m ready to commiserate with you or hear about your loss\u201d That would be appropriate. \n\nBut she was trying to reach out and tell you that you weren\u2019t alone. Losing a child is incredibly isolating and I\u2019m sure she was doing what she wish someone else had done for her: say I see you, I know how deeply this hurts, because I\u2019ve been there. \n\nHow would you like it if she came to you and said her loss was bigger because she never got to meet and hold her living baby like you did. Obviously that would be an AH thing to say. And it is neither more nor less true than what you said to her. \n\nYour losses are not the same. But they are similar. One was not bigger or smaller than the other. They were just different. \n\nIt can wait until you\u2019re out of this blinding grief stage, but one of these days, you owe her a massive heartfelt apology. I hope that it was your grief that clouded your empathy and you\u2019re not normally this self centered and cruel. But from the comment of not even knowing what she was talking about, I have a feeling you were an AH before your loss. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have so conveniently forgotten that your brother and his wife had also lost a child. \n\nI hate to give a YTA to a grieving parent, but in this case your behavior is so clearly and massively AH; and because it was directed, inconceivably, at another grieving parent, you earn every inch of my YTA vote.", "Final sentence tipped it over the edge.\n\nMay be grief, but, YTA.", "YTA and by a massive amount. Be it a stillbirth, miscarriage or a child being born and then passing, no matter which situation, it is a child's life that was cut far too short and she was only trying to show sympathy because of the same experience of losing a child. No matter what the reason, cause or state of growth, it is horrible. No parent should ever have to outlive their child plain and simple, and to basically go \"My pain is greater than your pain!\" is simply a massive AH move. This could have been a bonding experience but nope, you had to crush her and by extension your brother, with your comments. I'm sorry for your loss, but grieving is not an excuse for being such an asshole.", "I'm not even going to say you're the asshole, I am sorry for your loss, but it is not a level of grief contest.

I do not know all the facts surrounding it, but that was a fully formed child your SIL lost and, I suspect, her loss is also great. That child was real to her and her dreams for its future were real. This is not about whose loss hurts more.  Both sides involved are greatly pained.  How do you think it made her feel to minimize her loss?\n\nI'm going to give you a pass in that I know grief, something I do know a lot about, is a powerful and incredibly painful experience.  While others may be trying to give words of comfort, sometimes that is not what we want to hear.  We're hurt, we're angry, we need something/someone to strike out at.  That's just what you did.  I do not doubt that your SIL was trying to comfort you in her own way, albeit maybe not adeptly.  When we're grieving we are consumed with our own grief which we all know is greater than anyone else's ever and don't want anyone suggesting they understand.  How could they?  We know OUR grief is the deepest.  \n\nSo, I am truly so very sorry for your loss.  I am also sorry for your SIL's loss which was also great, especially to her.

We all got together for her funeral, just really close family, and said goodbye to her.\n\nAt one point my sister in law came up to us and started to go on and on about how she knew how we felt because she had lost a child as well. I genuinely didn\u2019t know what she was talking about, and told her so. She said of course I knew what she was talking about, her baby that was miscarried at 21 weeks.\n\nShe did have to deliver the fetus after it had passed and they gave her a name and had a little mini funeral for her. None of us went to that (it happened at the hospital where she miscarried, wasn\u2019t an event for us to go to/ we were not invited). This was a couple years ago.\n\nI told her that she had not lost a child, she had a miscarriage and it\u2019s completely different, and she has no idea what we\u2019re going through. She got upset and said she was just trying to show empathy towards us and say she knew what we were going through. Eventually things escalated and I told her to get out (this was while eating lunch after the main funeral event).\n\nMost of my family thinks we were wrong to be upset and that she was just trying to empathize with us and that she really did lose a child too. I don\u2019t want to talk to her again until she admits that her loss was not on the same level as ours and that she cannot relate at all.
