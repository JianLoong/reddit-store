You'd \"try\" not to mess up \"the vibe\", but your very presence would do just that.\n\nWomen having a girls night don't want to have to explain themselves to a guy. Explain the joke, explain why we all know exactly what we mean when we use certain references.

Try to truly, deeply, thoroughly understand this: you, a man, have male privilege. Society is completely structured to give you what you want. Progress has been made to \"start\" to \"think about\" the idea that \"maybe\" other people are equal, but it's still so very far away from happening. We live in a world where women don't have rights to their own bodies, where men make the rules and the laws, where women have been seen as their father's property until they become their husband's property, where they had to fight to get the right to vote, the right to have a bank account, the right to have a job, the right to have a VOICE.\n\nFor God's sake, let them have a goddamn night without you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Thank you for all the awards!", "YTA.

For example, when my girl friends and I talked about things that our bfs did that irritated us, we often had to explain things to guy friends if they were present. If it was just us, we could just rant and rage without needing to get into the whole \u201ewhy it\u2019s annoying when you don\u2019t clean up the hair you just shaved off from the bathroom sink\u201c-shebang. Whenever we talked about shit things men did to us, we had to mince our words of rage if a guy was present because he\u2019d inevitably feel attacked; if it was just us, we could just rant.\n\nI get that you want to understand more about how women experience the world, and you\u2019re right that it\u2019s a lot easier when people actually explain stuff to you. But women aren\u2019t encyclopedias, they\u2019re not service providers handholding you through explanations of every aspect of female experience. That shit is exhausting! We need breaks from that! And girls nights are an excellent form of that break, and it\u2019s an asshole move to want to take that from your friends.", "Buddy I hear ya and have been right where you are. It sucks feeling left out. \n\nBut over the years I\u2019ve learned that there truly are some times that women really just want time to be women with other women- no matter how close they are with guy friends or how integrated the guy friends are in the group. \n\nAnd in my experience, pressing the issue because your feelings are hurt will only push your friends away. \n\nYTA for not respecting their safe spaces when asked to.", "YTA.

There are things women don't feel comfortable sharing with a man around. That can be stupid things like joking about embarrassing period stories, it can be about female medical issues, it can be about sex, it can be about traumatic experiences, etc. It's needed to sometimes talk to only people of your own gender because they can relate to things others can't. It's also normal in group dynamics that not every meeting is for everyone. The point is not to exclude someone, it's just to spend time with the people specifically invited.

No sir, we want a night off from being studied, thanks. \n\nYour next complaint is that you will be alone that night. Oh well. It isn't anyone's job to make sure you are always entertained and have company.

We forgot he was there.  I suddenly remembered him after about an hour of us doing 'girl talk'.  Never in my life have I seen such a red face.  Poor guy now knew far more about his mates sex life, their failings and kinks, the women's health problems, and generally who was screwing who, than he ever wanted to know.

I still understand the desire to have a fun night with a certain vibe, but by now i kinda feel left out, since that just means me not hanging out with anyone that night.\n\nI tried making that clear and told them that I'd try to take a backseat and not mess up the vibe. That i feel like there are aspects of them that i would never get to know because of my gender. They responded that i still couldn't join because I just don't get certain things. Again, I understand that sentiment, but how are men supposed to ever understand 'certain things' if we dont get invited? \n\nThe converstation basically ended with me telling them, that i found their behaviour hurtful and since then i can see that they feel kind of bad because of it. \n\nAITA for not respecting their safe spaces?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I didn't invite my white friend who I live with and later felt quite bad when he asked me about it. I raise this example because it comes closest to the notion of \"safe space\".\n\nA third example to contrast - a group of guys in relationships have a guys night without their girlfriends.

If your not comfortable expressing anything different to them then that\u2019s fine and 100% up to you, but they aren\u2019t mind readers.", "I had a very small class while getting my masters that was six very southern girls and one guy from Manhattan. By the time the professor walked in, we'd all be neck deep in some conversation with the one guy looking like he was begging for help. The professor also had a knack for walking in at like the WORST point in a conversation, and often just walk back out to compose himself. It was a wonderful class, with wonderful people, but those guys just definitely had some eye opening experiences with what women's spaces are like.", "I am not the comment you\u2019re replying to. But in college, I had a lot of guy friends. In conversations, I would often notice them suddenly realizing I was there and turning to apologize for something (nothing offense/sexist or anything, just maybe something they felt more comfortable saying to the boys than saying to a female friend). I started making sure that I wasn\u2019t around every single time they wanted to hang out. And that wasn\u2019t explicitly framed as \u201cboys night\u201d, it was just an all boys hang out plus me. \n\nWomen are socially conditioned to generally keep certain things secret and we\u2019re told that we should be ashamed of x, y, and z. Outside of my partner, there\u2019s plenty that I likely wouldn\u2019t talk about to my male friends unless they explicitly asked\u2014but I would freely tell a female friend. \n\nI imagine it\u2019s much the same for men.", "And my axe.", "For what it\u2019s worth, I believe in the gender spectrum and self identification, and as a woman, sometimes I really only want to be around other women. There are things that cis men won\u2019t ever experience or understand or relate to.", "What are you on about?", "Silence, terf", "The morning sprint to the bathroom hoping nothing overflows before you get there....", "[deleted]", "Apparently Usain Bolt is the fastest human ever. \n\nObviously nobody has timed a woman trying to get to the nearest bathroom when the floodgates open.", "Me, I'm more of a \"legs clamped shut penguin waddle\" type gal", "That they are an egg?", "That makes them an egg. The person posting is likely trans or somewhere other than cis on the gender spectrum.", "I still don't understand why they're an egg :/", ">\u201chow are men supposed to ever understand 'certain things'\u201c\n\nThey can make a post on r/askreddit like every other guy does at least twice a week\n\n\"Men of reddit, what's something you want to know about women but never had a chance to ask?\"\n\nBoom. Done. Now he can know without invading his friends.", "Girl say it again for the m************ in the back", "If his friends are adults, they're not girls either. They're Women.", "Pretty transphobic lol", "This dudes definitely gay or trans", "This,  spot on.  If I'm having a bad period,  I *might* tell a male friend I have bad cramps.  You better believe my girlfriends and I go into explicit details.  Maybe they want to talk about dick size and not feel like they are possibly body shaming the man in the room.  There are lots of things I don't feel comfortable discussing with a guy, no matter how progressive he is.", "Yeah, kinda got that impression too :(", "Is that something that magically came up after people started commenting that this was giving them predator vibes...?", "Came for the egg comment", "right? They are all his friends who, according to him, are practically his entire social circle. He is not the bad guy for feeling rejected. Also, I see many comments that assume that he is a disgusting guy when it is clear that this does not apply here.", "Such a weird response. Of course there are many, many, many experiences all of us will never understand. I\u2019ll never understand what it\u2019s like to be a cis white male. Or a cis black male. Or a cis black woman. Or\u2026etc. Those are facts, they aren\u2019t offensive to me. \n\nWhy does it offend you to be told that a cis man will never understand what it\u2019s like to be a woman?", "is that not a thing already?", "What this says is it's OK for you to not want to discuss gender specific things with them and yet expect them to discuss gender specific things with you. Hypocritical double standard anyone?", "Nope", "Period shits.", "It's bizarre that you specify trans women here rather than cis men. Which of thatpotatogirl6's points do you think trans women wouldn't experience?", "I said changeable, childless folks who want children can go the adoption route, fostering, etc. Jobs can change, and even with limitations you're not forced to do retail your entire life.\n\nAnd I'm going to disagree with you. I'm not upset at not being invited to go to concerts or clubs that I'd find very overstimulating, and I hope my disabled friends aren't upset if we go hiking or swimming or doing workouts like Zumba together. It isn't every outing, and it's ridiculous to assume everyone can attend everything.\n\nThis is coming from someone who is very sensitive to anything that feels like rejection (often called rejection sensitivity dysphoria) and chronic pain that has made me put a pause on my ideal career track. Not everything is accessible or inclusive, and it would be rude to restrict EVERY group activity based off the single or few who cannot participate.", "agreed! I am nb but still identify with womanhood because there are thing i experience and will continue to experience because i have and always will be seen as a woman (which i am fine with). I have a very close male friend but we both know that there are things he will never get because he can't experience them. he can listen to me, but that usually becomes an educational experience about why womanhood is hard. thats why women and even nb feminine or female raised like to be around people who also experience those things", ">it would be rude to restrict EVERY group activity based off the single or few who cannot participate\n\nI disagree. If two people are not allowed you cannot invite the whole rest of the group without being rude. A smaller one or two people yes but not the entire rest of the group.\n\n(Again totally aside from this please reconsider your views on changeable parenthood. It\u2019s hurtful to assume people who want to be parents will get to be parents somehow. Even adoption and fostering are not available routes for everyone. My SIL would love more than anything to have been a parent)", "I have lots of nb or trans friends and sometimes we still end up with... what's not necessarily girls' nights, but nights that don't have any cis dudes at them. We're not being malicious, we're not trying to exclude, we're just having a fun night. The funny thing is, if we were doing something a cis male friend would be interested in, we might invite them, but none of my cis male friends would complain about a 'girls' night'. The fact that OP is complaining about it says, to me, that he is going to \"ruin the vibe\".", "I\u2019d believe that if not for the use of males and females", "Yeah no, that's dumb. That sounds more like playing favorites than saying \"we enjoy this activity but know you can't join, so we'll hang out you with later but want to do this with those that can\".", "Oh nevermind, I didn't read the crappiest comment properly, sorry.", "Idk I would never tell my friends - it\u2019s important that I hang out with all but two of you tonight. Because that would be rude and unkind. I will never not think that but thank you for the conversation.", "Yeah, I can't imagine hearing someone complain that say, 5 of their friends wanted to go skydiving but since they couldn't, they demanded 2 of the group be excluded and thinking that person was in the right.  I'm not on OP's side but I'd actually say that's way worse than what he is asking for here."]}
