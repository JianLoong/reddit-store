You'd \"try\" not to mess up \"the vibe\", but your very presence would do just that. \n\nWomen having a girls night don't want to have to explain themselves to a guy.

We live in a world where women don't have rights to their own bodies, where men make the rules and the laws, where women have been seen as their father's property until they become their husband's property, where they had to fight to get the right to vote, the right to have a bank account, the right to have a job, the right to have a VOICE.\n\nFor God's sake, let them have a goddamn night without you.", "YTA.

Whenever we talked about shit things men did to us, we had to mince our words of rage if a guy was present because he\u2019d inevitably feel attacked; if it was just us, we could just rant.\n\nI get that you want to understand more about how women experience the world, and you\u2019re right that it\u2019s a lot easier when people actually explain stuff to you. But women aren\u2019t encyclopedias, they\u2019re not service providers handholding you through explanations of every aspect of female experience. That shit is exhausting! We need breaks from that!

It sucks feeling left out. \n\nBut over the years I\u2019ve learned that there truly are some times that women really just want some to be women with other women- no matter how close they are with guy friends or how integrated the guy friends are in the group. \n\nAnd in my experience, pressing the issue because your feelings are hurt will only push your friends away. \n\nYTA for not respecting their safe spaces when asked to.", "YTA.

I recently moved into a new city and made a new mostly female friend group. They now plan to host their first 'girls night' and inviting most of the group except for me and another guy. I still understand the desire to have a fun night with a certain vibe, but by now i kinda feel left out, since that just means me not hanging out with anyone that night.\n\nI tried making that clear and told them that I'd try to take a backseat and not mess up the vibe. That i feel like there are aspects of them that i would never get to know because of my gender. They responded that i still couldn't join because I just don't get certain things. Again, I understand that sentiment, but how are men supposed to ever understand 'certain things' if we dont get invited? \n\nThe converstation basically ended with me telling them, that i found their behaviour hurtful and since then i can see that they feel kind of bad because of it. \n\nAITA for not respecting their safe spaces?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That i feel like there are aspects of them that i would never get to know because of my gender. They responded that i still couldn't join because I just don't get certain things. Again, I understand that sentiment, but how are men supposed to ever understand 'certain things' if we dont get invited?\n\nThe converstation basically ended with me telling them, that i found their behaviour hurtful and since then i can see that they feel kind of bad because of it.\u201c\n\nThey had more than a \u201cconversation about how he was hurt\u201d like you claim. He wasn\u2019t invited, he claimed he understood why he wasn\u2019t invited but then tried to get an invitation anyway (arguably proving him he didn\u2019t understand why he was invited at all) and then told them how hurt he was that they wouldn\u2019t give him what he wanted.
