I thought that sounded really great and wanted to go. Never been to San Diego but heard great things about it. My girlfriend then informed me that it was a girls\u2019 trip and that her 3 friends also aren\u2019t bringing their boyfriends. \n\n\nNot gonna lie, I was a bit miffed, but accepted it. My girlfriend understood. It\u2019s not like we never do great things as a couple and I completely understand that me being there would affect (or ruin) the vibe. Told her to have fun and go. I trust her so nothing will really happen. \n\n\nA couple of weeks later I mentioned this to a friend of mine and he told me that 2 days after my girlfriend will leave they have a trip to Jamaica planned and he invited me to go with. It was a bit last minute, so it took a bit of effort to get everything sorted out. I told my girlfriend and she didn\u2019t have a problem with it.\n\n\nWhen we were meeting at the airport (going with a group of 6 guys, me included) I realised that 3 guys brought their girlfriends along. I thought I fucked up and asked if they knew I was going etc. They told me it was fine, and that the friend I spoke with on the phone asked them (and their girlfriends) permission for me to come. They said it was fine for me to go with. The 2 other guys don\u2019t have girlfriends so I wouldn\u2019t be a third wheel.\n\n\nWe went to Jamaica and had an absolute blast. While on the phone with my girlfriend  during the trip, I told her about the situation and she didn\u2019t appear happy but didn\u2019t say much about it.\nThen when I came home last week, we had a fight about it. She wasn\u2019t cool with me going while some of the guys\u2019 girlfriends were also going. I told her absolutely nothing happened. She said I shouldn\u2019t have gone at all, when I realised the girlfriends were also going. \n\n\nI asked why she thought something might happen, and she told me that one girl, is apparently, romantically interested in me and is flirting with me. I thought that is complete bs because she is in a 4 year relationship with my friend and because she has this vibe with everyone. She also didn\u2019t trust another girl because she has a very promiscuous (wild) past. Also irrelevant because she is in a 2 year (monogamous) relationship with my friend. All in all nothing weird happened.\n\n\nShe still called me an asshole.\n\n\nNote: I replaced the colorful (offensive) language my girlfriend used while describing both my friends\u2019 girlfriends sexual past and current behaviors, with better terms or left it out.", "created_utc": 1689275645, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ytmyw/aita_for_going_on_my_own_trip_while_my_girlfriend/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
