I thought that sounded really great and wanted to go. Never been to San Diego but heard great things about it. My girlfriend then informed me that it was a girls\u2019 trip and that her 3 friends also aren\u2019t bringing their boyfriends. \n\n\nNot gonna lie, I was a bit miffed, but accepted it. My girlfriend understood. It\u2019s not like we never do great things as a couple and I completely understand that me being there would affect (or ruin) the vibe. Told her to have fun and go. I trust her so nothing will really happen. \n\n\nA couple of weeks later I mentioned this to a friend of mine and he told me that 2 days after my girlfriend will leave they have a trip to Jamaica planned and he invited me to go with. It was a bit last minute, so it took a bit of effort to get everything sorted out. I told my girlfriend and she didn\u2019t have a problem with it.\n\n\nWhen we were meeting at the airport (going with a group of 6 guys, me included) I realised that 3 guys brought their girlfriends along. I thought I fucked up and asked if they knew I was going etc. They told me it was fine, and that the friend I spoke with on the phone asked them (and their girlfriends) permission for me to come. They said it was fine for me to go with. The 2 other guys don\u2019t have girlfriends so I wouldn\u2019t be a third wheel.\n\n\nWe went to Jamaica and had an absolute blast. While on the phone with my girlfriend  during the trip, I told her about the situation and she didn\u2019t appear happy but didn\u2019t say much about it.\nThen when I came home last week, we had a fight about it. She wasn\u2019t cool with me going while some of the guys\u2019 girlfriends were also going. I told her absolutely nothing happened. She said I shouldn\u2019t have gone at all, when I realised the girlfriends were also going. \n\n\nI asked why she thought something might happen, and she told me that one girl, is apparently, romantically interested in me and is flirting with me. I thought that is complete bs because she is in a 4 year relationship with my friend and because she has this vibe with everyone. She also didn\u2019t trust another girl because she has a very promiscuous (wild) past. Also irrelevant because she is in a 2 year (monogamous) relationship with my friend. All in all nothing weird happened.\n\n\nShe still called me an asshole.\n\n\nNote: I replaced the colorful (offensive) language my girlfriend used while describing both my friends\u2019 girlfriends sexual past and current behaviors, with better terms or left it out.", "created_utc": 1689275645, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ytmyw/aita_for_going_on_my_own_trip_while_my_girlfriend/", "score": 363, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's worth just keeping your mind aware of possible future \"accusations\" around being with people of the opposite sex.\n\nI'd sit her down and do a status meeting on where you guys are at and giving her space to discuss any feelings she may have.\n\nIt's possible that one of the girls may have said something to your girlfriend that has her feeling insecure, or she could just be uncomfortable that you went on vacation without her and she's using anything to justify her feelings without just saying upfront that she was uncomfortable with it.\n\nAt this point all you have is the power of deductive reasoning, especially if as you said in another comment, this behavior is out of the blue.", "*slowly fades out of existence*", "NTA\n\nYour girlfriend sounds controlling.

In your post you say your GF does not trust 2 of the girls for whatever reasons she gives, but the big question is...Does she trust you? If the answer is yes, then she should not have an issue with who is around you. If the answer is no, then your relationship has a problem.", "NTA and your gf's insecurity is a huge red flag.\n\nIt's pretty messed up that she would think that 1) the other girl would cheat on her boyfriend, plus 2) try to steal a guy she knows is in a relationship, and that 3) *You* would cheat on her, 4) basically in front of all your friends on a group trip!\n\nAll for of those points together is just an insane leap in logic and shows a clear lack of trust in, well, basically everyone. It's not like you took the opportunity while your gf was gone to sneak away just you and this other girl.\n\nNot only does it show an insane level of distrust in you, but it also shows that if the tables were turned, you would most likely not be able to trust your gf. Cheaters very frequently project their own untrustworthiness on to others, because they think it's the normal way to view the world. They think everyone is doing it because they're doing it.", "NTA. still struggling to understand why she would give a shit", "I have concerns about projection her.

If my husband decides to go on a trip with his buddies that's perfectly fine. If it is OK for your gf it should be OK foe you.", "Tell her she can either trust you, and shut up about it.\n\nOr not trust you, and break up over it.\n\nEither way, you win.

Like whi care if the girls are flirty or if they have a past as long as she trusts you to say no. Like if they fling themselves at you of course you'll say yes. If anything if that is her concern she should be a more supportive partner because consistently receiving unwanted sexual advances isn't \"every guys dream\". \n\nAnd if she says she does trust them just not you that is even worse in a sense. That implies that she is concerned they will do sexual things without your consent. What an awful thing to think. It's also weirdly victim shaming. Like she's mad you still went on the trip.
