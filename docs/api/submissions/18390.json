That seems like a great arrangement for all concerned. Grandma gets her own room, the two younger children don't have to share, your niece gets to sleep somewhere she feels comfortable, and your children seem happy to have her there. \n\nAnd she's 19, she can make her own choices.", "NTA. Thats a long time to expect someone to sleep on a couch, with no privacy and time to themselves. You did what was best for your niece and she is old enough to make her decision", "NTA. The niece is old enough to make decisions and forcing her to stay with them won't make things better. You aren't wrong OP.\nIt's a win win situation for everyone involved.", "NTA. Your niece is 19, made her own choices and feels safe and comfortable. Also, your house is only 5 minutes away, so I'm sure she'll still have plenty of time to meet with her grandmother if she wishes to.", "NTA \n\nIts great that you gave your niece a safe place. She's 19, she's old enough to make the decisions to stay at your place without needing permission from her parents.", "NTA. Niece was obviously upset and you provided a space for her to stay that she found more comfortable than home given the circumstances.", "NTA and her parents are wrong here. She\u2019s an adult and can make her own choices. She\u2019s clearly more comfortable and happy staying with your family than sleeping on the couch at her parent\u2019s house", "NTA\n\n There is a reason why she doesn't really want to see grandma", "Hard NTA.  No 19 yr old wants to sleep on a couch with no privacy for a whole summer.\n\nSounds like a great solution.  And at 19 legally niece can live where she wants.\n\nAlso as someone who is on the autism spectrum, being forced onto a couch like that for weeks/months would drive me crazy.  I need quiet private space to be alone a decompress.  Niece would likely have spent the summer constantly overstimulated with no way to unwind.  And that is cruel on the parents part.\n\nSo yeah.  NTA.", "NTA:  It's one thing to give up a room for a night or weekend, it's a totally different thing to not have a room for the entire summer.\n\nKudo's to you for giving your niece the option of staying with you.", "NTA. She's grown. They should maybe reevaluate why she doesn't want to spend time there.", "Your niece is an adult. Her parents can cry all they want. Who takes a room away from an adult for three months then complains they came to see them? NTA.", "NTA. You are being very kind to your niece.  If her parents and Gma want to see her *they could invite her over*. There's a point at which a child is no longer a child and needs to be treated with respect.", "NTA\n\nYour niece is expected to sleep on that coach for that long? HELL NO! You\u2019ve done the right thing in allowing your niece to stay. In fact I would say her parents are the aholes for expecting their child to sleep on the couch for that long!", "\n\nNTA - You clearly weren't trying to make your brother or SIL upset, you simply wanted to help your niece out and give her a better option. If you didn't do this, she likely would not get enough sleep and could be negatively impacted by that. You provided her with a great alternative and she is taking advantage of it.", "Your niece is 19 and can decide where she wants to live!\n\nNTA!", "NTA. You are doing the right thing for your niece.  I don\u2019t blame her for not spending much time there.  Can\u2019t see wanting to spend a whole bunch of time with someone who got me kicked out of my room for 3 MONTHS.", "NTA it sounds like brother and SIL don't want the work of having to arrange social gatherings so grandma and your neice meet up. If niece was in their house, it would be automatic. I predict a future where they complain that their adult children never see them, but they expect the adult children to make all  the effort, e.g. by doing all the travelling and fitting in with the parent's schedules without consultation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They expected your freshly adult niece to live on a couch in the common area for, if I'm counting correctly, 2 to 3 months? And they're angry with her for looking for a better arrangement? I understand things happen, but why are they *intentionally* trying to keep her in a cramped and Stressful environment? Your family seems a little unhinged, no wonder the eldest has issues sharing her private space!", "NTA, she\u2019s an adult and you have her an option.", "NTA. This is not the first time I\u2019ve seen a story here about parents making one of their kids give up their bed for a visiting relative, causing problems with siblings and disrupting general household peace. Is it too much to expect the parents(who invited the guest anyway) to give up their room? Giving guests a comfy place to sleep is normal, especially if it\u2019s an elderly family member, but when it causes so much drama why don\u2019t parents just give up their own bed?", "ESH If you are only 5 minutes away why can\u2019t your SIL or brother come get her to visit with Grandma? Could it be that you have free round the clock babysitting and a capable 19 yo who does chores whenever asked (since you\u2019re letting her live there I\u2019m sure she feels obligated) so you don\u2019t really encourage your niece to go home during daylight hours or bond with her grandma? Yeah it sucks that your SIL and brother expect her to have no personal room for a month but you sure benefited.", "And my kids love sharing. We got them a bunk bed and turned the bunks into forts for each of them. They never want to leave.", "Especially someone who is a legal adult, with a job, and struggles with sleep in a new environment/out in the open", "Right! I\u2019m wondering why her parents didn\u2019t tell grandma to get an Airbnb.

Its May and the woman is staying until August. They wanted her to sleep on the couch for three months.\n\nAnd maybe just maybe the niece enjoys being there and is a decent kid willing to help.", "That's great. And if your brother and SIL aren't happy with how often your niece is seeing the grandma, it's up to them to organise family outings or get her over for dinner or something.", "Idk it looks to me like OP gets a free live in nanny for the summer or maybe indefinitely. I fully agree that the brother and SIL are being aholes. At the very least they should buy another mattress for niece to double up with one of her siblings. I just don\u2019t think OP is as altruistic as they are trying to portray. She gets to tell everyone what good person she is, stick it to her brother & sil, and a third adult in the house to pick up the slack. Win win win for OP.", "What assumptions? The 19 yo niece is living there \u201calways willing to babysit and does her chores without being asked.\u201d What am I assuming?"]}
