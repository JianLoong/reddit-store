We have a 9 year old dog that is a very sweet and quiet dog and is getting up in age.\n\nOur downstairs neighbor's bedroom is right below our bedroom. We are connected by her ceiling and our floor. She came up to complain to us, a couple months ago, that there's a weird vibration coming from our bedroom floor (her ceiling) that wakes her up at 530am. She had been hearing it for a couple days and it's getting frustrating. We understood because, yeah it sucks getting woken up by some weird noise. The thing is, we didn't even know what noise she was hearing until one day I woke up around 530am and I heard it but it sounded very faint and as if it was coming from our connected wall with another neighbor. \n\nI told her that it wasn't us and that I had heard it too. Just to be safe, we picked up anything off the floor that could possibly be causing those sounds. The neighbor came to complain 3 more times about the sound even though we had nothing to do with it. She eventually made a noise complaint against us for that vibration sound.\n\nWe went to go talk to management and the manager essentially took our side and explained that she talked to our neighbor telling her that she lives in an apartment complex especially a pet friendly one. Noise will be made. The manager further explained that our neighbor said she will probably have to look for a different place if this sound thing isn't resolved to which the manager essentially shrugged her shoulders.\n\nAbout a week later, the neighbor comes banging on our door at 650am to tell us that our dog jumping on and off our bed is waking her up and it disturbs her. (I want to mention that I have asked her if any other noise made bothers her and she said no.) She went on to say we need to be more conscious of where our dog is in the apartment and that she doesn't want to believe that we are doing this on purpose otherwise she will have to report us to management. We already have our dog in the living room and don't let her in during the night. We start our days as early as 630am to get ready for the day even on the weekends. When we get ready we let our dog come into our room to greet us but we try to keep her quiet so she doesn't disturb the neighbor downstairs until quiet hours are over.\n\nKeeping in mind about the complaint made yesterday about our dog, we helped her up and down the bed this morning and our neighbor banged on our bedroom floor (her ceiling).\n\nI want to state again that this is a pet friendly apartment building. \n\nI would get if our dog was running around or barking, etc but she just has been jumping on to the bed. We pay to be here and we don't want any problems with our neighbor. But we're thinking of just keeping our dog outside the room until late morning just so our neighbor doesn't think we are doing it on purpose.\n\nI do want to know if we are the assholes, tho, so we can change and coexist with our neighbor. \n\nSo, AITA for not catering to my neighbor?", "created_utc": 1685885926, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140ddb5/aita_for_not_catering_to_my_neighbor/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These are just things that naturally come with apartment/townhouse living.\n\nSounds like you're doing a lot already to help the issue, more than you arguable need to do, more than I would given this person's rude behavior.

Those shoes.... just wow", "NTA she has started harassing you at this point. I'd complain and say anytime you try to get ready for work or just live in your own space she bangs on the floor or comes up and bangs on your door to harass you.", "Gently, YTA\n\nI've been having this exact problem with my upstairs neighbour (dear God I hope you aren't my upstairs neighbour), and I suspect that you're missing a crucial piece of the puzzle, which is that the noises your downstairs neighbour is hearing are EXPONENTIALLY LOUDER than you realise. It likely sounds like a bowling alley from down there.\n\nI love living in a pet-friendly building, to be clear. Lots of my neighbours on my floor have dogs, and in over a decade of living here I have never been the least bit bothered by them, despite my having what is known as \"intractable migraine\" - a severely debilitating condition that is basically a migraine that never goes away. I am very sensitive to noise, light, and lots of other things, but a few happily barking dogs or gleeful children doesn't bug me at all . . . it's the sound of a happy building, IMO.\n\nBUT . . . I got a new neighbour about a year ago, and for the first time in years (I had never heard noises from upstairs before at all, our building is pretty well constructed), it suddenly sounded like someone was crashing large furniture over, or rolling bowling balls around above me at all hours of the day and night. It was AWFUL. I couldn't even figure out what could be making such awful, resonating, vibrating noise . . . it literally shook my apartment, sometimes woke me from a sound sleep after midnight or in the wee hours of the morning!! \n\nThen I did some Googling and spoke to some people. It turns out noises that happen because of things hitting the floor above (like your dog jumping off the furniture, or even just a thumping tail against an uncarpeted floor) ECHO THROUGH THE LAYERS OF FLOORING, WHICH AMPLIFIES THE NOISE. What sounds like almost nothing to you? Likely sounds like you are dropping large dumbells on the floor from below, every single time your dog jumps off the furniture.\n\nSo yeah, YTA. Yes, you pay to live there; so does your neighbour. And if you live in an apartment building, your right to be noisy ends at the floor and walls. There is no reason why your dog NEEDS to jump on and off the furniture. Frankly, it should be crated overnight in these circumstances. You know that you're causing unbearable noise to someone else - I'm here to tell you they're not exaggerating. A friend of mine thought like you until HER downstairs neighbour had her stand in their apartment and listen to her cats jumping around from below. She was mortified at how loud it was. \n\nGet some rugs and train your dog. It's the least you can do to be a half-decent neighbour in a shared space.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
