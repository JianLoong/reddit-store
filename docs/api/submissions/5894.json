My husband and I share a 1 bedroom house with our 2 under 2 and three German Shepherds. We both work.\n\n*** Edit to add, the sheps are fine. We have 5 acres & do actually train and excercise them**\n\nSo for context, my (26F) husband's (33M) grandmother (78F) had a cancer removal procedure on her face & it left half her face with no skin. She needs wound care, home health once a week. Bandage needs changed every other day though. I told him she could stay temporarily but not long term. We live in a one bedroom house with our 2 kids (almost 2M & 1F) as well as our 3 German Shepherd's. She initially stayed 3 weeks. His cousin (20F) & I would help with woundcare when home health wasn't here. His grandmother expects me to make her 3 meals a day, whenever she wants. I work nights and nap when the littles nap during the day, she will often wake me up because she wants her bandage changed or food during these times. Last week she started yelling at my son while he was playing. She also told me that my dogs are \"poor dogs because I had them crated\". It was for 15 minutes while I cleaned the floor and their paws since it was muddy outside. A week ago, she decided to go home. I told my husband I did not want her coming back. I feel its important I meantion there are 4 capable adults living with her that can take care of her. Went out two days later and changed her bandage. I spoke with my SIL (33F) about her coming to get the woundcare supplies, even offered to meet her somewhere. Well, she never got them. So fast forward to today, the bandage has not been changed in 5 days. His grandmother and niece (10F) showed up to our house unannounced at 6:30AM, waking all of us including the babies up. I was livid. Not only did my husband not talk to her about staying home, but they just showed up early morning without asking. She lacks boundaries and that's a problem for me. I told my husband I do not want her here as I have too much on my plate. He works 12s M-F so childcare is solely on me during that time. I also work, cook, clean, train, groom, & take care of three dogs. We got in a huge argument and he thinks I'm unreasonable and that his Nana is just a poor old woman who needs help. I left the house with the kids & he says I'm being a jerk.

Something's wrong with that scenario. \n\nYou have enough responsibility with 2 toddlers & 3 dogs. I can imagine that taking care of your household takes an immense amount of time & energy.

This sounds like potential elder abuse on the part of the others.", "NTA!!!!! So much to unpack here I don\u2019t know where to begin. Edited to add:\nThis is all on your husband.

It\u2019s ridiculous that they haven\u2019t stepped up and your husband should be looking to them for help, not you (solely). He needs to acknowledge and respect all of what you do when he isn\u2019t home and then still go to work afterwards. Tbh every other adult in this equation is the jerk, not you OP.", "NTA. You aren't the default caregiver for his extended family. He should move in with her and take care of her.", "NTA\nYou shouldn't be dealing with the nana.

You're doing literally 10x as much. \n\nYou and Husband need to have a sit down with the 4 adults that Nana lives with and tell them to get their sh*t together or you're calling elder services.

How long is her recovery expected to take?\n\nSeems like someone else should be able to take a turn actually caring for her and not just neglect her.

It\u2019s easy for you husband to feel like she\u2019s a little old lady, but you\u2019re the one doing all the work. Honestly, I don\u2019t know how you haven\u2019t collapsed under the weight of your responsibilities. That was completely inappropriate for your SIL to show up like that.

You put your boundaries in place and no one else respected them.

Not everyone can afford nor wants a huge house...I would rather have the outdoor space myself and it sounds like the kids and dogs are happy and have a great life!", "NTA.

Stay gone.", "**NTA**\n\n***It's a pressure cooker situation:*** working nights w/ limited sleep, being in tight quarters limiting space for kids, OP & grandmother is cranky, ill spirited, complaining personality.

Whether it's at someone else's house or the main house.**\n\nEveryone needs to discuss how to treat her condition AND who's going to care for her.  My great-aunt had 5 kids. She was in her 90s when she mentally & physically started to break down couldn't live on her own.\n\nAt first, the eldest child her daughter took on all the care, but it was too much for her at her age. So, they decided they'd take care of her for one month each meaning they got her around 2\u00bd months out of the year. Then it reached a point where they had to put her in an assisted living facility. She died at the age of 106.\n\n***OP has to make a statement to all it's wearing her down & can't do it all.***\n\nOP explain your husband might be understating the issue to all the family members because he wants to step up to the plate. Unfortunately, he's not the one being pulled apart.\n\nExplain to all exactly what's happening (*tightness of space, having 2 kids under a certain age have to supervise, working nights getting limited sleep, husband unable to assist in care with hours & dogs needing to be tended to*).\n\n***Wound care is a very serious matter especially in the elderly. Gangrene, flesh eating bacteria & other communicable serious infections can make the person sicker, spread the disease to others (kids & you) as well as causing death.***\n\n***If no one can't be consistently caring for her, this is a very serious problem.***\n\n*Everyone needs to offer solutions, alternatives & schedules of help & who can reliably volunteer time & efforts, regardless of if male or female. If what's holding them back is doing wound care. Arrange time to show how to do it. Have these supplies at each & everyone's house.*\n\n**Then whomever are the** ***leader(s)*** **have them inform grandma.**\n\nIf all can't assist, then find contact directly her doctor. Find out through the office or a medical social worker if can get RNs/LPNs to do more of the *concentrated wound care* through community service programs for outside home care. When there is no one that can assist, they can do more concentrated work.\n\nMaybe a social worker can place her temporarily in a nursing home/rehabilitative short-term center while she recovers. Depending on countries I don't know how that works. In the US, Medicare can cover for short term rehabilitative care, not long term. Maybe that's what will help in this situation if no one else can do this.\n\nThe husband's logic is not there. Pushing someone else to do the care & not realizing exactly all that it entails is mind blowing. That's too much to take on for someone being a mother of young children & works a night shift.", "OP ppl are shitting in you for having 2 kids and 3 dogs in a small home\u2026 but 5 acres is the perfect playground for a kid, if you ask me! My grands and great-grands knew a thing or two about having a big family in a small house\u2026 but of course they were homesteaders and farmers who spent most of their days outdoors. On the homestead everyone pulled their weight. If Nana has the strength to open her mouth she\u2019s got the strength to cook her own food, is what my grandma would say. Of course, my grandpa had a backbone, so he wouldn\u2019t have put his wife in that situation\u2026 may your husband get around to growing one somewhere on that acreage.
