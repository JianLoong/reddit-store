There were a few choices put forward towards the community - playground for children, basketball court, outdoor gym, BBQ pits, garden, dog park etc. \n\nThe one that really caught my eye was a dog park. I have a dog so to me it would be great if I lived right next to a place for dogs to play. So I campaigned for it. I went around and talked to a lot of people and got their support. I posted online about it. Some of the people I talked to were against the idea because they just didn\u2019t like it or wanted something else, but that\u2019s to be expected - can\u2019t have everyone on your side after all. But most people were for it. A lot of people just assumed it was going to be a playground and didn\u2019t even know we had a say. \n\nOnce I got the support I went to the officials and now the patch of land is going to be a dog park! While most people are happy, I\u2019ve gotten some really negative attention from a few individuals, particularly Ben. \n\nBen really wanted a playground for his kids. He says that it would have turned into a playground if I hadn\u2019t interfered. I pointed out that if he wanted one so bad then he could have done the same thing I did and went around to get support for it. He says that\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d because he doesn\u2019t have the \u201ctime or energy\u201d. He says that once I learned that some people wanted a playground I should have just stopped because kids are more important than dogs. I said that since it\u2019s land for the community then what the community as a whole is more important that what he as an individual wants. And when I was going around talking to as many people as I could only the minority wanted a playground, a basketball court, or a garden etc. If a lot of people didn\u2019t want a dog park and wanted something else I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get the support that I did. There\u2019s actually more people with dogs than with kids in the area I live in. There\u2019s also already a small playground, but it\u2019s further away and a bit run down and old. \n\nThen he called me some unkind names, accused me of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d everyone into \u201chating\u201d children, said something about how it\u2019s a \u201cpopularity contest\u201d (claiming that because I\u2019m a girl I can bat my eyes and get what I want more than him, a middle aged guy) and how my parents didn\u2019t bring me up right. \n\nMy parents taught me that if I want something to go and fight for it.

They are equally happy going for a walk, or playing fetch at the park, or going to doggie daycare, etc. they don\u2019t need a dumb fenced it square of mulch to run around in unleashed.
