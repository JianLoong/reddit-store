Recently it was decided that they\u2019re finally going to turn into something! There were a few choices put forward towards the community - playground for children, basketball court, outdoor gym, BBQ pits, garden, dog park etc. \n\nThe one that really caught my eye was a dog park. I have a dog so to me it would be great if I lived right next to a place for dogs to play. So I campaigned for it. I went around and talked to a lot of people and got their support. I posted online about it. Some of the people I talked to were against the idea because they just didn\u2019t like it or wanted something else, but that\u2019s to be expected - can\u2019t have everyone on your side after all. But most people were for it. A lot of people just assumed it was going to be a playground and didn\u2019t even know we had a say. \n\nOnce I got the support I went to the officials and now the patch of land is going to be a dog park! While most people are happy, I\u2019ve gotten some really negative attention from a few individuals, particularly Ben. \n\nBen really wanted a playground for his kids. He says that it would have turned into a playground if I hadn\u2019t interfered. I pointed out that if he wanted one so bad then he could have done the same thing I did and went around to get support for it. He says that\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d because he doesn\u2019t have the \u201ctime or energy\u201d. He says that once I learned that some people wanted a playground I should have just stopped because kids are more important than dogs. I said that since it\u2019s land for the community then what the community as a whole is more important that what he as an individual wants. And when I was going around talking to as many people as I could only the minority wanted a playground, a basketball court, or a garden etc. If a lot of people didn\u2019t want a dog park and wanted something else I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get the support that I did. There\u2019s actually more people with dogs than with kids in the area I live in. There\u2019s also already a small playground, but it\u2019s further away and a bit run down and old. \n\nThen he called me some unkind names, accused me of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d everyone into \u201chating\u201d children, said something about how it\u2019s a \u201cpopularity contest\u201d (claiming that because I\u2019m a girl I can bat my eyes and get what I want more than him, a middle aged guy) and how my parents didn\u2019t bring me up right. \n\nMy parents taught me that if I want something to go and fight for it. So I did. \n\nAITA for pushing for getting a dog park built because I wanted it more instead of a playground in my community?", "created_utc": 1697933799, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dgj0d/aita_for_stopping_a_playground_from_being_built/", "score": 338, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But if not, then if anyone is to blame here, it's the council. Rather than looking at a petition they should have carried out a poll to find out what people mostly wanted in an unbiased way. That's their job, not the community's job to do for them, and since they didn't do it they went with the loudest voice, which was you.\n\nBtw as a parent: a dog park is still a useable green space and it's a fenced area safe from traffic. Kids can still run around and play in one. Maybe it's not as good as a playground but it's better than nothing.

To spend that amount on a area none of the locals have voiced an opinion on is risky, when they can put up a few benches for a seating area or tables for lunches or as in this case fences for a dog park.

I can't remember). Both neighborhoods were middle class but the one holding the vote was more working class while the next one over was definitely a higher tax bracket with spouses who could stay home or at least make their own schedules.
