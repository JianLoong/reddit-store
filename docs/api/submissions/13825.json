My younger brother was like your sister Katie.  Entitled and completely opposite from me.  He was spoiled by my parents, and so he would start trouble.  If I retaliated, I was punished.  If I complained, I was told I am older and supposed to know better.  When I would try to explain that he started it, they would tell me I am older and supposed to know better\u2026\n\nSo, I made my exit plan\u2026 I worked and planned and chose a college hours away and a picked a major that I liked that would lead me to a career making good money after 4 years of school.  Once I was \u201cgone\u201d, I would come back to visit sometimes my first two years, then I got a part time job and apartment and came back less and less.  When my mom complained about me not visiting, I said, I\u2019m older, I know better than to be around my brother\u2026 he stayed because he was a selfish entitled jerk.  He got married young, had kids, cheated on his wife, divorced, his kids hate him\u2026\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was nearly 40 that my dad confessed they messed up with parenting us\u2026\n\nSo, focus on your exit plan to become a self sufficient independent adult as soon as practical.  You have 2 years until you can legally move out.   Figure out what career you want to become self sufficient and independent in your own place and make a plan and then work your plan.  In the meantime, get involved in a parttime job to earn money to save for your future and activities that look good on a resume.  Less time at home, more time doing stuff until you can get out.", "NTA\n\nThis definitely sounds like one of those My Story Animated scenes between sisters.

Just a thought.", "NTA, regardless of if space could be made they moved katie in without asking you, and once you finally tell them you aren't happy with it they disregarded your feelings to make it about your sister. It sounds like they are doing this thing that since you're the oldest all the other kids are \"just babies\" and are probably treated a little softer. At least in my opinion. I have 2 kids with an ex, and our oldest daughter is definitely held to a different standard by their mother since \"shes the oldest\"", "nta - why can\u2019t your parents make you a room in the basement?", "NTA\n\nYou should be allowed to move into the basement. Your parents are being ridiculously controlling. It sucks that you are the one who has to move but they shouldn't attempt to control you by forcing you to share a room with your sister. Even if you got along reasonably well, most teens prefer their own private space.\n\nWhile some basements are safe because they have two means of egress in a fire or emergency - stairs that lead to an exterior door and windows large enough to wiggle through. Some basements are built into a bit of a slope so they are called walkout basements. They are really not basements and are more like a lower level with windows on one side typically.\n\nYes it isn't safe which is why it isn't permitted to have a bedroom in a basement without two means of egress but people do it and live to tell. My brother moved into an \"illegal\" basement in our home when he was in high school and he survived. Smoke detectors and CO2 detectors would be a must. CO2 should be in all homes but might be especially critical in a basement where there is a furnace and water heater with pilot lights", "NTA move your bed into the basement (granted, only if there are wondows) and see what happens.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere is the problem with locking your stuff?

Can you convert it into a livable bedroom?", "I think you should fight for this. If basement is livable this would be the best solution. It would help if you have some... let's say hobbies, acceptable for 16 yo, but not 14 yo. I know nothing about you or your family, but I suspect they have a big problem with your reasoning.

Maybe if you can find others (not emotional) arguments they will accept your decision.", "Why?", "Is there a way that you 2 could have a conversation in front of your parents? Is there a way you could move into the basement?", "So she rubs you the wrong way. Fair enough. \n\nSeeing as you can't change this though you need a solution that helps you.  I'm sure even you know that it is healthier for you to be in a bed so you need to be in it. The big question is can room be divided? If yes then talk to your mum and dad about separating it in a way that gives you both privacy I'm sure even they can understand the need for that. The screen can be a curtin on the ceiling to screen doors. All that needs to be done after that is a set of rules you both follow.

I would say just stick to yourself and move out when you can if you feel that strongly about it. Being 16 sucks but it\u2019s not fair for your sister to have to share a room with TWO other siblings that are significantly younger", "You are NTA as it is your choice, but you are naive to think that what you are doing now is better than potential conflict.

You are not a suitable roommate for kids 2nd grade or younger or pubescent boys, so you share with your nearly same aged sister, so if you refuse, you are acting like you're entitled to your own room (or the basement as a room.) This room assignment is what is appropriate per your parents' judgment. Nothing you have said makes it questionable that they pair you two together except you don't like her and they don't care that you want to have a tantrum about room sharing. If you have legitimate concerns about sharing that you haven't worked out with them, all they see is you being a brat about no longer having your own room.", "Yes they did when they moved to a private space to sleep rather than sharing a room. The parents made a rational choice to move them in together rather than use the basement as a bedroom, so I assume there are reasons its not acceptable that OP does not care for or understand. Perhaps there is no egress from the basement, perhaps there is too easy an egress and they don't want a 16 year old with free access to come and go, perhaps its their favorite place to have marital relations and they're not interested in her cramping their sex life. Whatever. Its not the bedroom they've made available to her.", "Since you\u2019re close to be an adult, you could move just roll with it for now and move out when you turn 18 if you don\u2019t like the situation", "Basements usually don't make for very good bedrooms because of the safety risk.

My parents will say no though. They always say no when it comes to trouble I have with Katie. As long as nobody else is complaining about the same stuff I'm meant to be a big sister and not stop liking her because of how she is with me.

Even had some extended family speak up about it.", "I'm not even asking them to move her out. Just let me sleep in the basement. I'd move down there if they'd let me (but they won't). And yes, I know it's part of being a family. I'd even accept going in with my youngest sisters. It would be much less conflict for that. Though it would still be an older sibling in the room so I know my parents won't agree either.", "It's not potential conflict. I dislike Katie. Being around her is trying for me. Especially when she's with her friends or interacting with them. But also when she's allowed to get away with things because she just does them to me. I bite my tongue a lot around her. But I also keep my distance so I can do that. I know I won't be able to if I'm around her more often than I am and sharing a room would be that.", "They don't work out any of my concerns regarding Katie.

So I protect my stuff from her, as best as I can, and I remove myself from a situation where I will bubble over.", "Sleeping on the couch isn't the same as demanding their own room. \n\nIt is not rational to room siblings who don't like each other together. It would be rational to use the basement as a bedroom in such circumstances. The kids involved are old enough to discuss sleeping arrangements with, which these parents clearly did not do. They created this issue.\n\nAnd an egress can be secured. That's not reason enough for this. Nor is \"we want to bang in the basement\". If that were the case, they would really need to adjust their priorities.\n\nShe's safe and sleeping in the house. That's what matters. She didn't make a big stink about it, OP just doesn't sleep in their bed. Not a big deal.", "Two years is a long time to a 16 year old.", "It all depends on where you live and the style of basement. In some places for a basement to be finished it has to have a window that allows egress. Also there are daylight basements where one wall is not even underground because the house is on a hill and so you have a sliding glass door or a bank of windows to allow light.", "You can't stop this move though. Nothing you say will change that, it doesn't matter if right or wrong.\n\n\nIf you need to get Katie to get the things you want then make her want them.

If she does violate the rules, let her and your parents know immediately\u2014ideally, have the rules written down with checkboxes for strikes so no one can dispute whether it happened. Try your best to genuinely go in expecting her to have grown up a bit and not break the rules\u2014even if it\u2019s unlikely, it\u2019s the best way to ensure your parents can\u2019t blame conflict on your attitude.\n\nIf she does hit three strikes, then you have clear evidence that she creates a hostile environment for you.

Make it clear to your parents that you Will Not be sharing a room w/ someone who violates your privacy, and be prepared to stay with another family member or a friend if they still refuse to fix the issue.

Except that would be a home invasion since they have since passed away and I don't know the new residents. \n\nIt wouldn't work for a very large person and it took some work to get in, but put a chair or ladder under it, and it would work as emergency egress for most teenagers", "I mean im sure new buildings have them but yeah any old buildings definitely dont have them live  i live in a neighborhood built in 72", "Among the myriad differences that make this a terrible comparison, the most relevant here is that one is a choice to share a room with someone you\u2019ve chosen as your partner, likely because you\u2019re compatible in many ways and enjoy their company. As opposed to being forced to share a room with a person you did not choose, when you\u2019re at an age where it\u2019s either difficult or impossible to make other arrangements if things sour.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s wrong or crazy to have kids share rooms, sometimes needs must, but this specific argument/comparison doesn\u2019t hold water.", "I just learned this about the UK (that you don\u2019t share prison forms) and I was shocked!!

But you could do that with flatmates.", "I also agree, but that's the norm in the U.S.", "Where??", "i know you\u2019re just a kiddo so it probably didn\u2019t occur to you, but i wouldn\u2019t go putting very revealing info (all of your siblings\u2019 names) all over the internet.\n\nalso, NTA. you\u2019re a teenager, and it\u2019s beyond inconsiderate and, frankly, *dumb* of your parents to invade your space like that. if they didn\u2019t want to have to work on space issues like this, they should\u2019ve planned better for that many kids growing together under one roof.", "NTA - My brothers got in a fight one day and one moved into the basement.  Unlike your parents, my parents felt since both of them thought it was great idea to be alone, it was fine. They moved a bed and other furniture down.   I get the feeling that your parents, unfortunately, are operating on what they think ought to be, not what is.  From what you said, your sister sounds like a nightmare, but it sounds like they are clinging to the idea that since you are older, you should be a bigger person and suck it up, because they aren't about to deal with Katie's behavior. That's just asking for things to get worse.", "NTA .

They could EASILY see the solution of making the basement your room and not forcing two hormonal girls who don\u2019t like each other to share a room.

If you don\u2019t want to do that the sofa should be fine.", "NTA\nTell your parents that your sister snores so you can't sleep in the same room because it will affect your schooling. Then if noone is using the basement get some friends to help you move your bed and stuff down there while your parents are out. Once it's happened they'll just accept it. It's the state of limbo that makes them think if they badger you enough then you'll give in.", "Wouldn\u2019t op be the spoiled one here", "Did you miss the stuff where Katie destroys OP's things?", "Make it clear?  It\u2019s their house.  The OP doesn\u2019t pay the rent or mortgage.

Katie is not a unique monster - Katie is a standard shitty 14 year old sibling, and this is standard shitty teenage sibling behavior. A younger sibling going through/wrecking/taking your stuff is part of the standard shitty teenage sibling experience.\n\nThat doesn't mean it's okay - it's pretty shitty! It's not okay that Katie probably does it to the other siblings, too, because Katie sounds like a shitty 14-year-old. But that still doesn't mean it's unreasonable of their parents to put them in the same room. It's much more reasonable to expect the 16-year-old to share a room *just like the rest of her siblings* than to expect two *preteens* to share their room with their much older sister while eldest gets her own private sanctuary.\n\nFortunately, OP's found a fix that works for her - both she and Katie get their own space, if she can get her parents onboard. And maybe having her own room will dilute some of Katie's shittiness (one can hope).\n\nBut Katie being shitty doesn't mean the only fair solution is to punt her back in with the preteens.\n\nETA: to clarify, in case your point was that Katie *is* an AH - yes, but Katie's not the one deciding sleeping arrangements here, which is the 'who's the AH' issue at hand. Katie's sleeping where she's put.", "I guess I don't understand what sleeping in the basement helps you accomplish, if all your belongings are still in the state space. It seems like the unconscious hours would be the easiest time to share space with someone you don't like...unless they are disrupting your sleep.", "I didn't get the impression that OP thinks it's outrageous to share in principle, just to share with Katie in particular if she has any other option.  Did Katie and OP each have their own room until the younger two sisters were born?  If I had been their parents, I'd have moved the two older girls together, or had them each sleep with a younger sister about 6 years ago.  As other people have pointed out, Katie would now have her own bedroom if her parents would let OP move into the basement.", "So it's just totally normal and acceptable to have your stuff destroyed and not be safe in your own room?", "I mean, you\u2019re right to a degree that sharing the room isn\u2019t the root cause of a fractured relationship. However- as someone who has experienced *both* a shared room and solo rooms, the shared room is like gasoline on a flame. If you have kids who have an acrimonious relationship, they NEED a place where they can escape to calm down.\n\nIf people have the space, then avoiding a shared bedroom is a great solution. If they don\u2019t, then you gotta look for a different solution. But don\u2019t be all snooty at this kid because she\u2019d rather sleep on a couch than share a room with her sibling. Just because you think private rooms are dumb doesn\u2019t invalidate her feelings.", "If OP leaves the house and stays w/ a friend their parents have no way of stopping them. They can\u2019t demand anything to happen in their parents\u2019 house, but they can make the decision not to live in it if it\u2019s not a livable environment for them", "just because its common doesn't make it right... maybe with young kids but not teens. don't have more kids than you have space, period. one of my closest friends had to sleep on the couch because his mom had a 1 bed 1 bath and kept having kids she couldn't afford. I felt so bad for him.", "It's pretty common for parents to blow off the oldest child's complaints about the behavior of the younger children.  This goes double if the oldest child is female. \n\nOP says she is the only one Katie treats badly, and it's not hard to figure out why.  Katie knows pefectly well that their parents won't do shit about it.  If one of the other children complained, they'd punish Katie, but OP is expected to put up with it.  \n\nMy younger brother was like Katie and my parents wouldn't deal with it.  He took full advantage.  I'm in my 50's now, but the day I moved out of that house still counts as one of the happiest days of my life.", "So you can just blithely fall asleep in a room that contains a person whom you don't trust on a deep level? How the hell do you even relax enough to fall asleep someone you distrust so deeply?", "So destroying a sibling's things are just totally acceptable and normal?", "I find AITA collectors to be more dramatic. \"Teenage girls are dramatic\". WOW", "Of course they can.  They are legally responsible for her, her friends parents aren\u2019t allowed to just take her without her parents consent.", "Just fuck the poor I guess.", "The parent's are still the AH for trying to make him share the room when he doesn't want to and has already come up with a perfectly good solution.", "Maybe Katie treats her differently because she is the only other teenage girl in the house, and that's what they do? I have 6 daughters.", "\"OMG, Mommy and Daddy won't let me have my own room, boohoo, it must be my sister's fault because she did something I didn't like when she was 9!\"", "So are you offering them money or what\u2019s your solution other then time travel", "You really are the dramatic one.

Also forcing kids of different genders to share or to share across a larger age gap, is harmful for those children. So siblings sharing isn't always an option and you need to take into account when you have those kids."]}
