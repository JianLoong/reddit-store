My younger brother was like your sister Katie.  Entitled and completely opposite from me.  He was spoiled by my parents, and so he would start trouble.  If I retaliated, I was punished.  If I complained, I was told I am older and supposed to know better.  When I would try to explain that he started it, they would tell me I am older and supposed to know better\u2026\n\nSo, I made my exit plan\u2026 I worked and planned and chose a college hours away and a picked a major that I liked that would lead me to a career making good money after 4 years of school.  Once I was \u201cgone\u201d, I would come back to visit sometimes my first two years, then I got a part time job and apartment and came back less and less.  When my mom complained about me not visiting, I said, I\u2019m older, I know better than to be around my brother\u2026 he stayed because he was a selfish entitled jerk.  He got married young, had kids, cheated on his wife, divorced, his kids hate him\u2026\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was nearly 40 that my dad confessed they messed up with parenting us\u2026\n\nSo, focus on your exit plan to become a self sufficient independent adult as soon as practical.  You have 2 years until you can legally move out.   Figure out what career you want to become self sufficient and independent in your own place and make a plan and then work your plan.  In the meantime, get involved in a parttime job to earn money to save for your future and activities that look good on a resume.  Less time at home, more time doing stuff until you can get out.", "NTA\n\nThis definitely sounds like one of those My Story Animated scenes between sisters.

Just a thought.", "NTA, regardless of if space could be made they moved katie in without asking you, and once you finally tell them you aren't happy with it they disregarded your feelings to make it about your sister. It sounds like they are doing this thing that since you're the oldest all the other kids are \"just babies\" and are probably treated a little softer. At least in my opinion. I have 2 kids with an ex, and our oldest daughter is definitely held to a different standard by their mother since \"shes the oldest\"", "nta - why can\u2019t your parents make you a room in the basement?", "NTA\n\nYou should be allowed to move into the basement. Your parents are being ridiculously controlling. It sucks that you are the one who has to move but they shouldn't attempt to control you by forcing you to share a room with your sister. Even if you got along reasonably well, most teens prefer their own private space.\n\nWhile some basements are safe because they have two means of egress in a fire or emergency - stairs that lead to an exterior door and windows large enough to wiggle through. Some basements are built into a bit of a slope so they are called walkout basements. They are really not basements and are more like a lower level with windows on one side typically.\n\nYes it isn't safe which is why it isn't permitted to have a bedroom in a basement without two means of egress but people do it and live to tell. My brother moved into an \"illegal\" basement in our home when he was in high school and he survived. Smoke detectors and CO2 detectors would be a must. CO2 should be in all homes but might be especially critical in a basement where there is a furnace and water heater with pilot lights", "NTA move your bed into the basement (granted, only if there are wondows) and see what happens.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere is the problem with locking your stuff?

Can you convert it into a livable bedroom?", "I think you should fight for this. If basement is livable this would be the best solution. It would help if you have some... let's say hobbies, acceptable for 16 yo, but not 14 yo. I know nothing about you or your family, but I suspect they have a big problem with your reasoning.

Maybe if you can find others (not emotional) arguments they will accept your decision.", "Why?", "Is there a way that you 2 could have a conversation in front of your parents? Is there a way you could move into the basement?", "So she rubs you the wrong way. Fair enough. \n\nSeeing as you can't change this though you need a solution that helps you.  I'm sure even you know that it is healthier for you to be in a bed so you need to be in it. The big question is can room be divided? If yes then talk to your mum and dad about separating it in a way that gives you both privacy I'm sure even they can understand the need for that. The screen can be a curtin on the ceiling to screen doors. All that needs to be done after that is a set of rules you both follow.

I would say just stick to yourself and move out when you can if you feel that strongly about it.

You are not a suitable roommate for kids 2nd grade or younger or pubescent boys, so you share with your nearly same aged sister, so if you refuse, you are acting like you're entitled to your own room (or the basement as a room.) This room assignment is what is appropriate per your parents' judgment. Nothing you have said makes it questionable that they pair you two together except you don't like her and they don't care that you want to have a tantrum about room sharing. If you have legitimate concerns about sharing that you haven't worked out with them, all they see is you being a brat about no longer having your own room.", "Yes they did when they moved to a private space to sleep rather than sharing a room. The parents made a rational choice to move them in together rather than use the basement as a bedroom, so I assume there are reasons its not acceptable that OP does not care for or understand. Perhaps there is no egress from the basement, perhaps there is too easy an egress and they don't want a 16 year old with free access to come and go, perhaps its their favorite place to have marital relations and they're not interested in her cramping their sex life. Whatever. Its not the bedroom they've made available to her.", "Since you\u2019re close to be an adult, you could move just roll with it for now and move out when you turn 18 if you don\u2019t like the situation", "Basements usually don't make for very good bedrooms because of the safety risk.

My parents will say no though. They always say no when it comes to trouble I have with Katie. As long as nobody else is complaining about the same stuff I'm meant to be a big sister and not stop liking her because of how she is with me.

Even had some extended family speak up about it.", "I'm not even asking them to move her out. Just let me sleep in the basement. I'd move down there if they'd let me (but they won't).

Though it would still be an older sibling in the room so I know my parents won't agree either.", "It's not potential conflict. I dislike Katie. Being around her is trying for me. Especially when she's with her friends or interacting with them. But also when she's allowed to get away with things because she just does them to me. I bite my tongue a lot around her. But I also keep my distance so I can do that. I know I won't be able to if I'm around her more often than I am and sharing a room would be that.", "They don't work out any of my concerns regarding Katie.

So I protect my stuff from her, as best as I can, and I remove myself from a situation where I will bubble over.", "Sleeping on the couch isn't the same as demanding their own room. \n\nIt is not rational to room siblings who don't like each other together. It would be rational to use the basement as a bedroom in such circumstances. The kids involved are old enough to discuss sleeping arrangements with, which these parents clearly did not do. They created this issue.\n\nAnd an egress can be secured. That's not reason enough for this. Nor is \"we want to bang in the basement\". If that were the case, they would really need to adjust their priorities.\n\nShe's safe and sleeping in the house. That's what matters. She didn't make a big stink about it, OP just doesn't sleep in their bed. Not a big deal.", "Two years is a long time to a 16 year old.", "It all depends on where you live and the style of basement. In some places for a basement to be finished it has to have a window that allows egress. Also there are daylight basements where one wall is not even underground because the house is on a hill and so you have a sliding glass door or a bank of windows to allow light.", "You can't stop this move though. Nothing you say will change that, it doesn't matter if right or wrong.\n\n\nIf you need to get Katie to get the things you want then make her want them.
