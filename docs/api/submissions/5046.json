When that date passed, I made it clear that I would not like any more help (first and last time), she took it personally and our relationship became uncomfortable.\n\n Last month (day 16),, I received an invitation from my son and Wendy to go to their house, because Wendy was going to make this dish. It was the first Sunday in December. \n\nTo clarify, this dish is not something you can eat two days in a row, as it is heavy.\n\n Some sent me a message, asking if mine would still happen (they know it's always the first Saturday) and I confirmed. \n\nOn the 20th, I sent the \"formal\" invitation by message. \n\nMy son called as soon as he received it, asking if it would be on the first Saturday and I confirmed and he started saying that people can't eat two days in a row and if I couldn't leave it for another week, because Wendy wanted to do it to get closer to the family. \n\nI said no, as it is my tradition and despite finding their choice of date unpleasant, I won't stop them, but I will continue with the usual dates. \n\nHe proceeded to say I'm making things uncomfortable and a week later it wouldn't bother me and used the coin her invite was before.\n\n I was perplexed and said that everyone knows it's the first Saturday of the month, including them, so it wouldn't change all my plans. \n\nThings got uncomfortable, of course. But I kept it, because it's something that doesn't just involve me (friends and Family already conformes)\n\nThere was a party on Saturday with family/friends (he and Wendy didn't come) and on Sunday (I didn't go, because I work that day) many didn't come and those who did, few ate the food (because they couldn't eat twice). . \n\nDuring the week, my son sent a message asking if it was worth it to have done that and upset her, because it spoiled this moment that she wanted to have with our family. He stressed that I could have been the best person, but I preferred not to be.\n\n I don't think this attack is very fair, but I wanted an outside opinion. It was the best date for all of my family and friends in December as they get to get together before the festivities (for me too). Tradition that has been going on for 10 years.\n\nAITA?\n\nI don't mind her doing this, I encourage it, but yeah, I found the choice of dates peculiar, 6 months in the year and any weekend and she chose the only weekend that I always do something to do the same.", "created_utc": 1671389679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp5ehe/aita_for_not_changing_my_tradition_day_to_my_dil/", "score": 1804, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s been a tradition for 10 Years!\u201d \nDIL being a chef doesn\u2019t give her the right to criticize seasonings, ingredients etc!

The same dish, the same weekend as you usually do it?\n\nThey didn't even ask you if you minded.

The only reason could be to say her version is better with her seasonings because she didn't like you saying you didn't want her help.\n\nShe played a stupid game and I'm sure your family are giving her the side eye. If she needs to do this to be part of the family maybe she needs to think about why, perhaps her attitude.\n\nUnfortunately it sounds like your son doesn't like to stand up to her, because why didn't he say let's do it on a different date, mum's always done it that day for years.\n\nMaybe you should share this post with them.", "NTA your DIL seems rude and I absolutely agree with the other posters here, she definitely wanted to upstage you because I guess she sees cooking as her thing. \n\nYour som, sadly sounds manipulative and so in thrall to his wife that he cannot see how deliberately rude and inappropriate her scheme was.", "NTA she took YOUR tradition and tried to make it something for HER.", "NTA but your DIL sure is. 1st to do it the same weekend and 2nd also to do the same recipe (or at least same dish)", "NTA.

Your son should have explained to his wife that this has been happening for 10 years. I also don't understand why she insisted on making the same dish. Your son and DIL were extremely  disrespectful.

Considering yours is every year so you were there first.", "NTA the son knows what day your own traditional food day is and should have coordinated it better and not assumed Wendy was allowed to take precedence over your ongoing tradition. If Wendy really wanted to just make an additional day for people to gather she could have just done it a week later so that there's enough distance between your day and hers. Putting the date of it right next to yours feels like she's trying to do a \"pick sides\" kind of argument but without actually putting it directly on your day because that would solidify her as intruding on your day. NTA. Don't ever make comments on her cooking or start arguments about what recipes are better because that will escalate the problem and make you look like the bad guy. I would recommend encouraging her to choose a day later in the month to do this, one which you yourself will be able to attend. Then go and try the cooking and do your best to compliment what she did well on it. Don't make any kind of criticism even if it's constructive because she won't want to hear it. Make it so she has her day and you have yours, at separate parts of the month, and hopefully that will solve the problem so long as nothing potentially resembling a complaint reaches her ears.", "NTA!

My youngest son has been married to Wendy for 3 years (together 1 before). I didn't know her that well, because they didn't live here. Wendy is a rising chef \n\nIn June, Wendy asked if she could help me make the dish and I said yes... It was my biggest regret. She gave advice on all seasoning choices and even though I said it's a family recipe, she kept giving her opinion. When that date passed, I made it clear that I would not like any more help (first and last time), she took it personally and our relationship became uncomfortable.\n\n Last month (day 16),, I received an invitation from my son and Wendy to go to their house, because Wendy was going to make this dish. It was the first Sunday in December. \n\nTo clarify, this dish is not something you can eat two days in a row, as it is heavy.\n\n Some sent me a message, asking if mine would still happen (they know it's always the first Saturday) and I confirmed. \n\nOn the 20th, I sent the \"formal\" invitation by message. \n\nMy son called as soon as he received it, asking if it would be on the first Saturday and I confirmed and he started saying that people can't eat two days in a row and if I couldn't leave it for another week, because Wendy wanted to do it to get closer to the family. \n\nI said no, as it is my tradition and despite finding their choice of date unpleasant, I won't stop them, but I will continue with the usual dates. \n\nHe proceeded to say I'm making things uncomfortable and a week later it wouldn't bother me and used the coin her invite was before.\n\n I was perplexed and said that everyone knows it's the first Saturday of the month, including them, so it wouldn't change all my plans. \n\nThings got uncomfortable, of course. But I kept it, because it's something that doesn't just involve me (friends and Family already conformes)\n\nThere was a party on Saturday with family/friends (he and Wendy didn't come) and on Sunday (I didn't go, because I work that day) many didn't come and those who did, few ate the food (because they couldn't eat twice). . \n\nDuring the week, my son sent a message asking if it was worth it to have done that and upset her, because it spoiled this moment that she wanted to have with our family. He stressed that I could have been the best person, but I preferred not to be.\n\n I don't think this attack is very fair, but I wanted an outside opinion. It was the best date for all of my family and friends in December as they get to get together before the festivities (for me too).

She was trying to upstage you to prove her recipe was better. If you do want her to share in that tradition you could explain that you'd love to have her around in the kitchen but that you are staying true to the integrity of the family recipe. Perhaps the next time you make the dish you two can collaborate on a varied dish to make something new together? I bet she does want to be involved and her way of showing that was trying to give her skills to the dish when you two were cooking the first time.

You have known this tradition for as long as you have lived. Wendy has known this tradition for the 3 years she has joined this family. You both had every other day in the year to choose to host the dish and you choose the day after i choose to host the dish. I will not be bullied by you and your wife. If anything is awkward it is of your own doing. I will continue my tradition as it is something that i have been doing for 10 years.

Why must she take over your tradition? Can she not make her own?  To try and take over food that you have been doing and make it her own, nope.  She is a chef.  I am sure she could come up with something of her own to do.", "NTA she mistakenly thought you would somehow appreciate her taking over your tradition, like you\u2019re gonna die soon and someone needs to step up.

You owe no apologies.", "NTA this was a very weird power move by your DIL. You are just doing what you have always done so I don\u2019t think you are in the wrong, she picked that date to create a problem. Your son should be able to see that. Since he can\u2019t, just ignore him because you\u2019ll never win there.", "Nta. Wtf was she trying to pull?! She\u2019s trying to take YOUR tradition over. She should start her own if anything.

You've done this for years, your family knows when youre doing your dish, and they know yours is good and how they like it.

They knew when you were doing it and she chose to do it anyways. It\u2019s also odd that she is doing the same exact dish\u2026rather than something different.
