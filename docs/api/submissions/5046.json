My youngest son has been married to Wendy for 3 years (together 1 before). I didn't know her that well, because they didn't live here. Wendy is a rising chef \n\nIn June, Wendy asked if she could help me make the dish and I said yes... It was my biggest regret. She gave advice on all seasoning choices and even though I said it's a family recipe, she kept giving her opinion. When that date passed, I made it clear that I would not like any more help (first and last time), she took it personally and our relationship became uncomfortable.\n\n Last month (day 16),, I received an invitation from my son and Wendy to go to their house, because Wendy was going to make this dish. It was the first Sunday in December. \n\nTo clarify, this dish is not something you can eat two days in a row, as it is heavy.\n\n Some sent me a message, asking if mine would still happen (they know it's always the first Saturday) and I confirmed. \n\nOn the 20th, I sent the \"formal\" invitation by message. \n\nMy son called as soon as he received it, asking if it would be on the first Saturday and I confirmed and he started saying that people can't eat two days in a row and if I couldn't leave it for another week, because Wendy wanted to do it to get closer to the family. \n\nI said no, as it is my tradition and despite finding their choice of date unpleasant, I won't stop them, but I will continue with the usual dates. \n\nHe proceeded to say I'm making things uncomfortable and a week later it wouldn't bother me and used the coin her invite was before.\n\n I was perplexed and said that everyone knows it's the first Saturday of the month, including them, so it wouldn't change all my plans. \n\nThings got uncomfortable, of course. But I kept it, because it's something that doesn't just involve me (friends and Family already conformes)\n\nThere was a party on Saturday with family/friends (he and Wendy didn't come) and on Sunday (I didn't go, because I work that day) many didn't come and those who did, few ate the food (because they couldn't eat twice). . \n\nDuring the week, my son sent a message asking if it was worth it to have done that and upset her, because it spoiled this moment that she wanted to have with our family. He stressed that I could have been the best person, but I preferred not to be.\n\n I don't think this attack is very fair, but I wanted an outside opinion. It was the best date for all of my family and friends in December as they get to get together before the festivities (for me too). Tradition that has been going on for 10 years.\n\nAdded: Many have asked, I apologize for being late. Feijoada is the dish, I know that many people in my country can eat it 2 days in a row, but we know that eating feijoada in a row is the recipe for a beautiful stomach ache, especially mine that comes with many complements.\n\nAITA?\n\n\n\nI don't mind her doing this, I encourage it, but yeah, I found the choice of dates peculiar, 6 months in the year and any weekend and she chose the only weekend that I always do something to do the same.", "created_utc": 1671389679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp5ehe/aita_for_not_changing_my_tradition_day_to_my_dil/", "score": 8752, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s been a tradition for 10 Years!\u201d \nDIL being a chef doesn\u2019t give her the right to criticize seasonings, ingredients etc!

The same dish, the same weekend as you usually do it?\n\nThey didn't even ask you if you minded. They're essentially saying you're in the wrong for not letting her hijack your tradition. \n\nYou're not TA at all for continuing to do something for the family that you've done for 10 years.", "nta\n\nguess she thought she could get her revenge by choosing the same weekend as you but that backfired.\n\ni wouldnt waste a second thought about it if i were you. everyone knew that you served traditional food on first weekend in june and december so they shouldnt be this surprised.\n\nits funny that your son says that you could have chosen another day, but, guess what, so could she. nothing stopped her from delaying the dinner by a week or two.", "I fail to understand how the DIL thought trying to steal a tradition which is well known within the family would get her closer to said family.

The only reason could be to say her version is better with her seasonings because she didn't like you saying you didn't want her help.\n\nShe played a stupid game and I'm sure your family are giving her the side eye. If she needs to do this to be part of the family maybe she needs to think about why, perhaps her attitude.\n\nUnfortunately it sounds like your son doesn't like to stand up to her, because why didn't he say let's do it on a different date, mum's always done it that day for years.\n\nMaybe you should share this post with them.", "NTA your DIL seems rude and I absolutely agree with the other posters here, she definitely wanted to upstage you because I guess she sees cooking as her thing. \n\nYour som, sadly sounds manipulative and so in thrall to his wife that he cannot see how deliberately rude and inappropriate her scheme was.", "NTA she took YOUR tradition and tried to make it something for HER.", "NTA but your DIL sure is. 1st to do it the same weekend and 2nd also to do the same recipe (or at least same dish)", "NTA. Your son and his wife know that you always do It that day. She tried to undermine you and take over your tradition. I would have done things the exact way you did", "NTA. Your son should have explained to his wife that this has been happening for 10 years. I also don't understand why she insisted on making the same dish. Your son and DIL were extremely  disrespectful.

She played a stupid game and it is amazing your son didn't reason with her.", "NTA.\n\nShe was being disrespectful of your tradition, and passive aggressive.\n\nYou should expect more of this behaviour.", "On the (very) off-chance that DIL is perhaps unable to read social cues and does not understand what she did wrong, it would be far kinder of her husband/your son to explain that trying to imitate your traditions without any conversation or input from you rather than berate you for keeping a long-term, widely known tradition. \n\nIf Wendy wants to become closer to your family, she should be encouraged to set her own traditions and celebrations and not take over yours.", "NTA. She was doing it intentionally to aggravate you. She knew when you did yours. Why should you be the one to change dates, why can\u2019t she change the date? Considering yours is every year so you were there first.", "NTA the son knows what day your own traditional food day is and should have coordinated it better and not assumed Wendy was allowed to take precedence over your ongoing tradition. If Wendy really wanted to just make an additional day for people to gather she could have just done it a week later so that there's enough distance between your day and hers. Putting the date of it right next to yours feels like she's trying to do a \"pick sides\" kind of argument but without actually putting it directly on your day because that would solidify her as intruding on your day. NTA. Don't ever make comments on her cooking or start arguments about what recipes are better because that will escalate the problem and make you look like the bad guy. I would recommend encouraging her to choose a day later in the month to do this, one which you yourself will be able to attend. Then go and try the cooking and do your best to compliment what she did well on it. Don't make any kind of criticism even if it's constructive because she won't want to hear it. Make it so she has her day and you have yours, at separate parts of the month, and hopefully that will solve the problem so long as nothing potentially resembling a complaint reaches her ears.", "NTA!

I\u2019m all up for children standing up for their parents to protect their spouses, but your son is clearly delusional.

But I kept it, because it's something that doesn't just involve me (friends and Family already conformes)\n\nThere was a party on Saturday with family/friends (he and Wendy didn't come) and on Sunday (I didn't go, because I work that day) many didn't come and those who did, few ate the food (because they couldn't eat twice). . \n\nDuring the week, my son sent a message asking if it was worth it to have done that and upset her, because it spoiled this moment that she wanted to have with our family. He stressed that I could have been the best person, but I preferred not to be.\n\n I don't think this attack is very fair, but I wanted an outside opinion. It was the best date for all of my family and friends in December as they get to get together before the festivities (for me too).

She was trying to upstage you to prove her recipe was better. If you do want her to share in that tradition you could explain that you'd love to have her around in the kitchen but that you are staying true to the integrity of the family recipe. Perhaps the next time you make the dish you two can collaborate on a varied dish to make something new together? I bet she does want to be involved and her way of showing that was trying to give her skills to the dish when you two were cooking the first time.

You have known this tradition for as long as you have lived. Wendy has known this tradition for the 3 years she has joined this family. You both had every other day in the year to choose to host the dish and you choose the day after i choose to host the dish. I will not be bullied by you and your wife.

I am sure she could come up with something of her own to do.", "NTA she mistakenly thought you would somehow appreciate her taking over your tradition, like you\u2019re gonna die soon and someone needs to step up.

Maybe in the future to make your son feel better she could make a side dish or do something else to help at your dinner that doesn't include anything to do with your family recipe.", "NTA. She can start her own traditions on her own dates. What she was doing was just plain silly", "NTA. Her chef ego got the better of her and she did this as a power move towards you. Your son is siding with her, that's a bit alarming to you probably, but keep your ground and keep yourself on distance from her. She is starting to show her true colors and you just have to wait for that to play out. I am sorry, but she does not sound like a nice DIL, let's hope she grows out of it. In the meantime DO NOT give up any of your tradition, you are not the one making things uncomfortable.", "Nta, she is", "NTA because this seems a pissing context started by Wendy, but I don't envy anyone having to navigate this.", "NTA. This was certainly a power play. She sounds like she thinks she knows better and she wants attention. Good for you for sticking to your plan. I would straight up ignore her. She sounds like a petulant child.", "NTA. She was doing this to spite you and it failed. Shame on your son for enabling this petty behaviour on her part. I'd love to know what the dish is, though.", "NTA. This is funny. She tried to usurp your long standing tradition, now she's salty because it didn't work. She was not trying to get closer to the family, she was trying to upstage you, shut you out and steal your tradition. That does not look good on her.", "NTA\n\nShe knew exactly what she was doing so I'd ask son the same question...was it worth it??? \n\nShe overstepped when she \" helped\" and now she's going to show you...How immature of her.", "So, she was making the dish you normally serve on your tradition days. The same one she criticized while she was only supposed to be helping. Your days have been happening long before her and will probably continue long after her. I think she is the AH for trying to hijack your dish and make people choose between yours and theirs. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhy didn't they wait a week? Why didn't DIL try to be the \"best person\"? Because they not only wanted to steal your tradition, they wanted to changed it, essentially breaking it.\n\nYou shouldn't feel bad for preserving a tradition everyone enjoys. They should feel bad for trying to ruin your 10 year old tradition to begin with.", "I wont judge this because it seems incredibly petty. Can't believe people ruin relationships over such stuff.", "NTA. Wendy knew there would be two possible outcomes. 1. She steal\u2019s OP established tradition of cooking this dish on this day or 2. she gets to present herself as martyred Cinderella with an evil MIL who deliberately stole her thunder and ruined her event. Bonus points because she managed to convince OP\u2019s son that she\u2019s the victim. It\u2019s really kind of masterful.", "NTA. Wendy is under some serious misappropriation about how one makes friends with and blends with a family. Instead of joining a tradition, she's trying to take it away from you.", "NTA\n\nShe did this on purpose and you didn\u2019t let her push you out. Good for yo", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like the DIL is super-competitive, and determined to one-up her MIL at all costs. \n\nIt's also possible that she's trying to engineer an estrangement between mother and son, by forcing the son to take sides. \n\nNext time something like this comes up, maybe ask Wendy to make her 'specialty,' whatever that is, to showcase her incredible cooking skills.", "NTA.  She\u2019s got some insecurities.  I am less concerned about this than what you cooked and what is so delicious you can\u2019t have it twice in one weekend.", "NTA. Also, what's the dish?! I'm dying to know what you can't eat two days in a row.", "NTA!", "NTA. I spent years cooking with my MIL. Industrial kitchen and mixer. 10lbs of flour for her rolls. Been trying to break that down for years!\n\nMy last batch was pretty much perfect. DH ate *one*. He told me I got them right. MIL is 89 and I'm the only one trying to figure it out. \n\nRolls and cinnamon rolls were her signature during the holidays. She doesn't cook anymore and I'm not trying to one-up her, just carrying on a tradition. \n\nDH scarfed down 6 cinnamon rolls last week, so I guess he no longer feels like we're betraying his mom. \n\nYou're DIL's critiques and timing tell me she's trying to one-up you and she's an AH!", "NTA. I really question DILs intentions here. Even if things had gone how she wanted, much of the family would observe that it was odd of her to try and upstage you in the first place. Not a good way to bond with the family. You did the right thing by not backing down", "NTA. There's a reason the term \"know-it-all\" is often proceeded by \"insufferable.\" She showed her whole ass and that's not your problem. Heck, she didn't just SHOW it, she sent out ass viewing invitations with an RSVP request. And your son's just trying to deflect blame onto someone else for his wife's and by extension HIS  bad behavior.\n\nAlso, I am aware of dog tax and cat tax. Is recipe tax a thing? If not, can we make it a thing? I feel many of us would be on board.", "Ask your son why his wife couldn\u2019t be the better person and schedule it for another week.", "NTA but I'm really confused why you can't eat the same dish two days in a row because it's \"heavy.\" I get not wanting the same dish two meals in a row (e.g. lunch & dinner), but not two days in a row. What do you do with leftovers?", "NTA, she was upset that you didn\u2019t want her help so she decided to try to make your family recipe better than you do and get some satisfaction from everyone enjoying it. She sounds petty and awful honestly, you did nothing wrong, if it was about getting closer to the family she could do a recipe that means something to her and her family. This is just pettiness", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to hijack your tradition.  She thinks she can do it better.  Your son is a big asshole.", "INFO What on earth is this dish that couldn't possibly be eaten two days in a row??? I've had so e pretty heavy dishes and was happy to eat more of it the next day?\n\nLike. She's was totally being petty and trying to make a power play by doing your dish on your weekend. In just really curious what it was.", "She\u2019s the asshole for trying to prove she can do it better. You could try handling it by suggesting she start a tradition of her own to get closer to the family, maybe a different dish on different months. But trying to upstage you at your own long-standing tradition and your son is the AH for supporting this petty power play.", "NTA. Why couldn't she have waited a week?", "NTA. If she wanted to cook this dish to be closer to your family, she could have asked you to let her cook with you.  There\u2019s no evidence, but I suspect that, being a professional chef, she expected to produce the dish in a way that had the family wanting her to take on the monthly task.", "NTA. This was a standing tradition, your son and DIL knew when you have this party and purposefully tried to get you to cancel it. They could have made a different dish or did it at a time that wasn't already established by a decade of regularity.", "NTA. You have a clear tradition. If I was attempting to add my own spin and contribute, I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t set it up against another family member\u2019s tradition.", "NTA your son seems to be overlooking the fact that the only reason for his wife to choose this date and announce it behind your back is to spite and one up you.\n\nIf it was just something she wanted to do to get closer to the family, September would have made sense. Making it a quarterly tradition with you twice a year and her twice a year could have been a beautiful expression of building up without tearing down.\n\nEven if she came up with it spontaneously and realized that Sunday was the only one that worked, she could have called you in advance and asked if you minded ceding this one time. \n\nTo casually issue the invitation like that was petty and cold, and in my opinion giving in to that would not have made you the bigger person. You did exactly what one should do in face of pettiness, carried on as planned and encouraged anyone who wanted to do so to attend her gathering too", "NTA and you should show this to your son.", "NTA,  if she wanted to try the same thing she could have chosen any other month or day to do it.  They are the ones making it uncomfortable.", "NTA. Do your tradition, and watch as no one goes to hers.", "NTA sounds like she's trying to over shadow you and I feel like because she's a cook she is trying to prove her dish was better than yours! Your son already KNEW that you did this meal on this date but still allowed his horrid wife to make the meal the day after! It is literally his fault for not telling his wife she needs to pick a different date! Your son and DIL is both TA here but you my dear is not! I have this feeling they will try again in June, be prepared to have to stand your grounds again! I would speak to other family members as well and try to see if they can talk some sense in to these two! I would also explain to him how it's not right or fair for her to think she can come in and just take over YOUR traditional meal that you've done at the same time EVERY YEAR and that you will continue to do so every year and if anyone is making things uncomfortable it's the two of them but especially the wife for trying to take over the family like she is! If she continues I worry about your relationship with your son. She doesn't sound like a great person to want to deal with", "NTA. I dont understand why the DIL couldn\u2019t choose a later date instead of infringing on your traditional date.  She\u2019s the AH. And your son for not suggesting she move the date.", "NTA - your DIL got offended when you didn't want her help again so she decided to try to show you up. She's the one being the jerk in the situation, and your son refuses to stand up to her", "NTA.  She is the one who made this adversarial - as you pointed out she could have literally chosen any other day (or month or week) in the year to make this dish. She chose this day and dish to challenge you. You called her bluff (not intentionally, but simply by continuing your decades long well known tradition). \n\nYour son is gaslighting you. What is the point of making you feel bad and asking you to be the better person, when his wife was not even a good person in this scenario? His anger is misplaced and it should be squarely focused on his wife.  Asking people to adjust for her bad behaviour is like treating the symptom, and not the disease. The fault lies strictly with his wife.\n\nThe worst part of this is not just the day, but the dish. She is a professional chef - she literally couldn\u2019t think of anything else to make while hosting a dinner? And how is this supposed to get her closer to the family? She\u2019s trying to show up her husband\u2019s mother - not a good look for anybody. If I were family, I certainly would see this as a direct insult to you and think poorly of her (that\u2019s putting it mildly).  They both owe you a huge apology. Maybe showing them this post and its comments will give them an idea of where they can start.\n\nI don\u2019t use this phrase myself, but I think it\u2019s apt here - they played s stupid game, and they won a stupid prize. They have nobody else but themselves to blame. I hope you get a proper apology soon.", "NTA. My aunt-in-law makes green bean casserole every thanksgiving. We didn\u2019t get to celebrate together this year, so I made an online recipe for my bf and I only. It was AMAZING, but we made a pact that aunt deb WILL NEVER EVER KNOW. Because we love her and we respect her traditions and her version is still fuckin amazing. \n\nDIL is disrespectful, she chose her dates intentionally, she played this card. All of the fallout is not on you.", "NTA. Your day has precedent and when you help someone cook something they always cook, you follow their instructions. If it really was about getting closer to the family she would do it the second Saturday or something else.", "I wish I could have a meal so awesome you can\u2019t have it 2 days in a row! NTA but what was it?", "NTA  \n\nShe's the one who made things uncomfortable.  She's the one who picked the day that she KNEW you would have your party the day before.   She's been with your son for three years, so it wasn't a mistake or ignorance.   She could have chosen any other day, but no, she has to be the one who is the better cook because she's a \"chef\".   \nChefs are great, don't get me wrong.   My son is a chef.   But they aren't the only ones who know how to cook.   Their recipe isn't the only good one.  I understand her wanting to show off her skills to the family.   That's a nice thing to do.   But to intentionally put yourself in competition with your boyfriend's mother is a poor choice.", "NTA - She's on a weird mission to aggressively mark her territory all over you for some reason.  Instead of your son trying to rein her in, he's enabling her strange behavior.\n\nShe is the cause for all this awkwardness.  If she can't behave in a civil and respectful manner, I'd just stop inviting her altogether.  She needs therapy to figure out why she feels she's in some kind of weird competition with you.\n\nAnd definitely decline to move your tradition for her.  You reserve 2 days a year, she can work around them if she feels she needs to host a dinner for attention.", "NTA sounds like she was just trying to upstage you on a family recipe. Weird and unnecessary competitive behavior.", "NTA at all.\nDIL chose that day to one up you and show everyone that she is the better cook, and that you should have listened to her when she told you how to make your food.", "She is the one that made this uncomfortable.  You do this twice a year. She has 10 other months and 50 other weekends to do this and deliberately chose that date to try to force your hand.\n\nGood for you for not giving it up. She is going to have to deal with it.\n\nNTA", "NTA and your son needs to rethink his train of thought. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think your DIL did this bc she\u2019s trying to \u201cget close with family\u201d but rather to show she\u2019s a better cook than you.

Or do it in November/January? \n\nThis reads to me that she was trying to make people choose between your party and hers, and her plan failed - they chose yours.\n\nI really need to know what dish it is, though.", "NTA.

She and your son are AH.", "Info: what is the dish?", "Your daughter in law may not be being rude on purpose, but your reaction seems justified. She is emulating your tradition, after having briefly participated it in it once, in a way that conflicts with your longtime custom. \n\nYour son asked you to \"be the bigger person\" -- which is an explicit acknowledgement that his wife is doing something wrong.

Don't let your son pressure you on this thing to thinking you're wrong. They knew what Saturday you do this as it has been going on for 10 years. They could have chosen another weekend but chose the same one on purpose.", "NTA it seems like DIL is trying to intentionally compete with you and prob trying to turn your son and possibly even others against you. Idk maybe I am being cynical, but it\u2019s weird she would try and impose her own takes to your family recipe then hold the same exact event a day after yours. Then she proceeds to blame you and claim it was her idea and date first. Smh.", "As a DIL to someone with a similar tradition I would never get in the way. I always offer to help cause I want to learn and be able to continue making the traditional food when my husbands parent are old, maybe I would change some seasoning then but not suggest that now since it\u2019s their recipe.\nI would also never get in the way of their tradition, that for us also is the first Saturday in December. That date is always open since we know there will be a meal\u2026 lack of respect from your DIL and mostly by your son.", "I seriously can't wrap my head around the fact Wendy wanted to get \"closer to the family\" (well on time after 3 years of marriage, no??) and decided a hostile takeover of a family tradition was THE way to do it...\n\nIf anything I would decided to go LC to NC over this disrespect. NTA.", "That sentence is from OPs initial post, so I don't think that's the DIL", "Lol. There is no salvaging this DIL. You done messed up. Big. Huge. Make your apologies and don\u2019t be so pretentious and passive aggressive in the future if you genuinely are trying to get close to your husband\u2019s family. This behaviour will 100% help you achieve the opposite. Sounds like you have a great in law in OP though. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll forgive you and move on.", "She was also a fool for picking Sunday knowing damn well OP always cooks it on a Saturday. She set herself up for failure.", "Yes and why mom's dish?  Is it her heritage", "Doesn\u2019t seem to be very much evidence to make such a big assumption", "Honestly, that's a really offensive thing to say. I have a personality disorder, and I would never do something like that.

I bet your were better than hers by far too.", "Yep. This was a power play and \"many didn't come and those who did, few ate the food\" was the best outcome. Trying to steal the event from OP shows a base character flaw in this person. I laughed at the outcome, and OP's son is in for a marriage of mind games and broken relationships. OP's son needs pull their head out of their rear and try to figure out why she tried to go head-to-head with tradition.", "NTA. She chose the consecutive Sunday, not OP's fault. It's been OP's tradition and unless otherwise OP says she can't do it anymore, Wendy won't be able to take it away from her.", "Based on the dish I\u2019m gonna say this is white people shit at play (from Wendy)", "right????  since its OP's tradition, why couldnt wendy use the following week or two later??? \n\nNTA OP. I admit.... I looked up Feijoada ...... I'd like to be added to your invite list :)", "My thoughts exactly! You can\u2019t come into a family and take over their tradition. And she totally thought she could do a better job. It\u2019s so rude! And controlling! Make your own tradition and be respectful!", "Yep.  She chose the date on purpose and played chicken with you.

I\u2019m dating a chef now and she only pipes up when I\u2019m quite obviously burining something or struggling.

You don't like it? Don't eat it. If you can make it better, go forth and cook it in your own kitchen. If it is better and I'm invited to taste it, I'll ask you THEN what you did differently. DIL tried the wrong power play twice, and it rightfully bit her in the ass.", "It makes zero sense!  How could any rational person think that would be a good idea?", "I can't get over DIL trying to advise MIL about the recipe. I'm a professional but when my gdma is making things she's made for 50 years and asks me if I approve of her technique/recipe I'm like ?? You have 50 years experience?? You tell me if the technique/recipe is good ! I'd never dare tell someone that they're doing something wrong when they've been it for far longer than I have without issues", "NTA. It is super douchey. It's not because you are a chef that only your recipes are good. I bet she could learn from OP if she was opened. Ancestral/family knowledge is as much important as what you learn in school. Plus you have to get down your high horse, it's not because you were formed that you can't learn from others. I'm a bachelor and I still learn from my clients who didn't study as much as me. Plus asking to change a family tradition for the DIL? Yeah that entitled AF", "I cook since I was like eleven (now 33) with some instructions of my mom.

Her spaghetti and meatballs were always my favorite, but she cooked without recipes, so no one in the family had managed to get her secrets down on paper. She and I must have made meatballs 30 times in the months we spent together, and each time, I did my best to write down what she used. Now I (and the family, by extention)  know the spices she used and can try our hand at getting it 'just right', though we never truly will.
