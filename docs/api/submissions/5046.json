When that date passed, I made it clear that I would not like any more help (first and last time), she took it personally and our relationship became uncomfortable.\n\n Last month (day 16),, I received an invitation from my son and Wendy to go to their house, because Wendy was going to make this dish. It was the first Sunday in December. \n\nTo clarify, this dish is not something you can eat two days in a row, as it is heavy.\n\n Some sent me a message, asking if mine would still happen (they know it's always the first Saturday) and I confirmed. \n\nOn the 20th, I sent the \"formal\" invitation by message. \n\nMy son called as soon as he received it, asking if it would be on the first Saturday and I confirmed and he started saying that people can't eat two days in a row and if I couldn't leave it for another week, because Wendy wanted to do it to get closer to the family. \n\nI said no, as it is my tradition and despite finding their choice of date unpleasant, I won't stop them, but I will continue with the usual dates. \n\nHe proceeded to say I'm making things uncomfortable and a week later it wouldn't bother me and used the coin her invite was before.\n\n I was perplexed and said that everyone knows it's the first Saturday of the month, including them, so it wouldn't change all my plans. \n\nThings got uncomfortable, of course. But I kept it, because it's something that doesn't just involve me (friends and Family already conformes)\n\nThere was a party on Saturday with family/friends (he and Wendy didn't come) and on Sunday (I didn't go, because I work that day) many didn't come and those who did, few ate the food (because they couldn't eat twice). . \n\nDuring the week, my son sent a message asking if it was worth it to have done that and upset her, because it spoiled this moment that she wanted to have with our family. He stressed that I could have been the best person, but I preferred not to be.\n\n I don't think this attack is very fair, but I wanted an outside opinion.

Tradition that has been going on for 10 years.\n\nAITA?\n\nI don't mind her doing this, I encourage it, but yeah, I found the choice of dates peculiar, 6 months in the year and any weekend and she chose the only weekend that I always do something to do the same.", "created_utc": 1671389679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp5ehe/aita_for_not_changing_my_tradition_day_to_my_dil/", "score": 445, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s been a tradition for 10 Years!\u201d \nDIL being a chef doesn\u2019t give her the right to criticize seasonings, ingredients etc!

The same dish, the same weekend as you usually do it?\n\nThey didn't even ask you if you minded.

The only reason could be to say her version is better with her seasonings because she didn't like you saying you didn't want her help.\n\nShe played a stupid game and I'm sure your family are giving her the side eye. If she needs to do this to be part of the family maybe she needs to think about why, perhaps her attitude.\n\nUnfortunately it sounds like your son doesn't like to stand up to her, because why didn't he say let's do it on a different date, mum's always done it that day for years.\n\nMaybe you should share this post with them.", "NTA your DIL seems rude and I absolutely agree with the other posters here, she definitely wanted to upstage you because I guess she sees cooking as her thing. \n\nYour som, sadly sounds manipulative and so in thrall to his wife that he cannot see how deliberately rude and inappropriate her scheme was.", "NTA she took YOUR tradition and tried to make it something for HER.", "NTA but your DIL sure is. 1st to do it the same weekend and 2nd also to do the same recipe (or at least same dish)", "NTA. Your son and his wife know that you always do It that day. She tried to undermine you and take over your tradition. I would have done things the exact way you did", "NTA. Your son should have explained to his wife that this has been happening for 10 years. I also don't understand why she insisted on making the same dish. Your son and DIL were extremely  disrespectful.

She played a stupid game and it is amazing your son didn't reason with her.", "NTA.\n\nShe was being disrespectful of your tradition, and passive aggressive.\n\nYou should expect more of this behaviour.", "On the (very) off-chance that DIL is perhaps unable to read social cues and does not understand what she did wrong, it would be far kinder of her husband/your son to explain that trying to imitate your traditions without any conversation or input from you rather than berate you for keeping a long-term, widely known tradition. \n\nIf Wendy wants to become closer to your family, she should be encouraged to set her own traditions and celebrations and not take over yours.", "NTA.

Considering yours is every year so you were there first.", "NTA the son knows what day your own traditional food day is and should have coordinated it better and not assumed Wendy was allowed to take precedence over your ongoing tradition. If Wendy really wanted to just make an additional day for people to gather she could have just done it a week later so that there's enough distance between your day and hers. Putting the date of it right next to yours feels like she's trying to do a \"pick sides\" kind of argument but without actually putting it directly on your day because that would solidify her as intruding on your day. NTA. Don't ever make comments on her cooking or start arguments about what recipes are better because that will escalate the problem and make you look like the bad guy. I would recommend encouraging her to choose a day later in the month to do this, one which you yourself will be able to attend. Then go and try the cooking and do your best to compliment what she did well on it. Don't make any kind of criticism even if it's constructive because she won't want to hear it. Make it so she has her day and you have yours, at separate parts of the month, and hopefully that will solve the problem so long as nothing potentially resembling a complaint reaches her ears.", "NTA!

My youngest son has been married to Wendy for 3 years (together 1 before). I didn't know her that well, because they didn't live here. Wendy is a rising chef \n\nIn June, Wendy asked if she could help me make the dish and I said yes... It was my biggest regret. She gave advice on all seasoning choices and even though I said it's a family recipe, she kept giving her opinion. When that date passed, I made it clear that I would not like any more help (first and last time), she took it personally and our relationship became uncomfortable.\n\n Last month (day 16),, I received an invitation from my son and Wendy to go to their house, because Wendy was going to make this dish. It was the first Sunday in December. \n\nTo clarify, this dish is not something you can eat two days in a row, as it is heavy.\n\n Some sent me a message, asking if mine would still happen (they know it's always the first Saturday) and I confirmed. \n\nOn the 20th, I sent the \"formal\" invitation by message. \n\nMy son called as soon as he received it, asking if it would be on the first Saturday and I confirmed and he started saying that people can't eat two days in a row and if I couldn't leave it for another week, because Wendy wanted to do it to get closer to the family. \n\nI said no, as it is my tradition and despite finding their choice of date unpleasant, I won't stop them, but I will continue with the usual dates. \n\nHe proceeded to say I'm making things uncomfortable and a week later it wouldn't bother me and used the coin her invite was before.\n\n I was perplexed and said that everyone knows it's the first Saturday of the month, including them, so it wouldn't change all my plans. \n\nThings got uncomfortable, of course. But I kept it, because it's something that doesn't just involve me (friends and Family already conformes)\n\nThere was a party on Saturday with family/friends (he and Wendy didn't come) and on Sunday (I didn't go, because I work that day) many didn't come and those who did, few ate the food (because they couldn't eat twice). . \n\nDuring the week, my son sent a message asking if it was worth it to have done that and upset her, because it spoiled this moment that she wanted to have with our family. He stressed that I could have been the best person, but I preferred not to be.\n\n I don't think this attack is very fair, but I wanted an outside opinion. It was the best date for all of my family and friends in December as they get to get together before the festivities (for me too).

She was trying to upstage you to prove her recipe was better. If you do want her to share in that tradition you could explain that you'd love to have her around in the kitchen but that you are staying true to the integrity of the family recipe. Perhaps the next time you make the dish you two can collaborate on a varied dish to make something new together? I bet she does want to be involved and her way of showing that was trying to give her skills to the dish when you two were cooking the first time.

She probably thought your family would see her as the victim, and it didn\u2019t work. She needs to create her own tradition, or maybe just swallow her pride and learn how to do it from you.", "NTA- this seems like a pointed attack at you, you\u2019re entirely right that she could\u2019ve chosen ANY time in the year to do this, yet she chose a date right next to when you do your tradition. Her being a \u201cprofessional chef\u201d doesn\u2019t mean she can change your traditional family recipe just to, idk, rub it in your face?", "NTA\n\nMindy was trying to flex over you on your tradition, when it didn't work out, she's crying victim and sending your son to attack you.", "NTA, she was\u2026", "NTA, it\u2019s clear Wendy was trying to pull some kind of power move on you. This was a preplanned tradition and your son was well aware of this. And her choosing that specific date was no accident. \n\nAnd as someone who loves cooking for my family, I\u2019d find someone who is constantly in my ear telling me how to make my family recipe extremely pretentious and I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting help from her after that first time.", "Reply to your son\n\n\u201cFor 10 years i have had a tradition that family and friends have become accustomed to. You have known this tradition for as long as you have lived. Wendy has known this tradition for the 3 years she has joined this family. You both had every other day in the year to choose to host the dish and you choose the day after i choose to host the dish. I will not be bullied by you and your wife. If anything is awkward it is of your own doing. I will continue my tradition as it is something that i have been doing for 10 years. You be the bigger person in the future and remember that i will not stop or change my 10 year tradition for you.\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA\u2026everything your son said\u2026is true, but not about you, but about Wendy.  She is the one who has made things difficult.  You have been doing this for 10 years.  Who is she to all of a sudden come in and take over without even asking you?!  Why must she take over your tradition? Can she not make her own?  To try and take over food that you have been doing and make it her own, nope.  She is a chef.  I am sure she could come up with something of her own to do.", "NTA she mistakenly thought you would somehow appreciate her taking over your tradition, like you\u2019re gonna die soon and someone needs to step up. Little miss chef needs to step back and realise this tradition has nothing to do with her, she is a guest, not the chef, in this situation.", "Jealousy rules here. Unhealthy.\n\nHave a word with your son.\n\nNTA.", "NTA She is trying to steal your dishes and replace your tradition with doing it at her house with your guests instead. She trying to do a power flex and your son is enabling it. She needs her own tradition, her own food on her own day with her own guests instead of stealing yours. You owe no apologies.", "NTA this was a very weird power move by your DIL. You are just doing what you have always done so I don\u2019t think you are in the wrong, she picked that date to create a problem. Your son should be able to see that. Since he can\u2019t, just ignore him because you\u2019ll never win there.", "Nta. Wtf was she trying to pull?! She\u2019s trying to take YOUR tradition over. She should start her own if anything. She shouldn\u2019t be cooking your meal unless she took it up after you passed or something. Your son & dil are both acting extremely childish!", "NTA. You've done this for years, your family knows when youre doing your dish, and they know yours is good and how they like it. Your DIL knew what she was dojng, and was hoping that you would drop your tradition for her.\n\nShe is the AH here, and your son doesn't look much better for guiding her to a different week to do her take on your dish.", "NTA. They knew when you were doing it and she chose to do it anyways. It\u2019s also odd that she is doing the same exact dish\u2026rather than something different. It\u2019s obviously her attempt to try to \u201coutshine\u201d you since you didn\u2019t acquiesce to her suggestions.", "NTA. But she sure is!! She had a chance to integrate into the family and instead she decided to make it all about herself and presume to teach YOU how to cook YOUR food. Food is a language of love and connection. Sadly, some people -- like her -- can't see past the chemical elements and procedures of it. You need to break ot down just like this - explain that your view of food and family is very different, so you prefer to not participate.", "NTA\n\nWhen you join a new family you need to find your niche. \n\nShe has, instead of finding her own niche, decided to try and steal yours and has gotten into a pissing match with you without your involvement. \n\nYou have a long standing tradition. 1st Saturday of December you make X. It doesn\u2019t need a specific invitation because it\u2019s an annual dinner. Your DIL however, attempted to \u201csteal\u201d the event from you - everyone knows it was deliberate that she chose the 1st Sunday. \n\nShe has made the choice to ostracize herself. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong. If she wanted to become a more active and stable part of the family then she needed to do something no one else is already doing.", "Wendy is so fragile and self centered that, when you didn\u2019t change your traditional recipe to include some of her suggestions, she decided to play the victim and drive a wedge between you and your son. You\u2019ve done absolutely nothing wrong. I\u2019m glad your friends and family still came to your event. I\u2019m sure the meal was great. Your son is going to grow tired of her sooner or later. You seem pretty unbothered overall so I\u2019d say keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Nta", "NTA. I'm guessing DIL thought she could do it better and was trying to rub your face in it.", "Nta,\nI think she knew what she was doing.  10 years is long enough for your son to know.  He should have stopped her.  She caused the problem and he wanted you to stop the drama, but he is afraid of her.", "NTA. Your DiL knew what she was doing. She is trying to cause a problem between your son and you.", "NTA, of course, because lol you can\u2019t just come into a family and expect to steal someone\u2019s tradition. But also, I am DYING to know what the dish is.", "NTA she could\u2019ve done it in august or March and it would\u2019ve been fine, still a dick  move, but acceptable. She was trying to cause drama.", "NTA\n\nShe tried to usurp you and she failed. That's on her.", "Your son is either a huge AH or a complete idiot. \n\nDIL is either oblivious or stirring shit. \n\nEither way you did nothing wrong. If at least your son know the dates then again one of them is the ass", "NTA. It\u2019s your tradition and has been for 10 years. If she wanted to host something she should have picked a different date that didn\u2019t clash with yours. She made a power play and it failed. None of that is your fault. They are the ones who owe you an apology.", "NTA. She wanted to circumvent your tradition and do her little power play of hers is better then yours, to show that \"professionals\" know how to cook better. Does your son know you usually work on Sundays? If he does, that makes her even worse if she knew you would not be able to attend but still wanted you to move your date.", "Wendy is horrible. I feel so sad for you that your son married someone so petty that she\u2019s actively trying to destroy your family traditions. Your son owes you a huge apology. Shame on him for supporting this kind of behavior. NTA.", "This is over much more than food and traditions. This is a battle between mother and daughter for matriarchal control. Also depending on the relationship with son, making him choose between mom and wife by wife.\n\nAs was said this is a power play by wife. Husband is to \"cleave and leave\" once married, but the new family also has to be reasonable. My wife and parents (more dad than mom) went through this many years ago. I forced it to a head on both sides, pointed out to both sides when they were being unreasonable, and ultimately they found the middle. Now my wife and my parents have a great relationship.\n\nOP, I would say NTA. Be aware of the tough spot your son is in, but that doesn't mean you have to cave. Keep things civil, and don't rise to bait that will start a fight by DIL. But also remember than your son is married and will be starting his new traditions. You may need to be flexible on some (not saying this one but some) or risk losing opportunities to spend time with him and his family (DIL and assume someday their kids).", "NTA. \n\nAs you said, everyone knows you do this at the same time each month, so you aren't intruding on anything, they wanted you to CHANGE when you do things, but without asking you, just telling you that you were being mean by not changing something you have done the same way for years. \n\nDIL could have chosen any other weekend to do this, she purposefully chose that date to create some drama and ideally get you to not do your dish, per usual. That's not a way to be welcoming or feel included, that is her trying to cause problems and she is just mad that it didn't work.", "NTA this wasn't her trying to get closer to the family. This was a power play.", "INFO - do you work every Sunday?  Did your son know you would not be able to come to his home for the dinner because you would be working?\n\nAlso - is your tradition tied to a national holiday in your home country or a special day/event in your family and your dinner marks that occasion?", "Leaning towards ESH\n\nInfo\n\nWhy didn\u2019t you reach out to your son when you got the invite and said \u201chey son, I got this invite, you know I do first Saturday and meal is a lot to expect people to eat 2 days in a row.\nI\u2019m still planning first Saturday, why don\u2019t you move for a week or 2 later?\n\nSon and DIL shouldn\u2019t have scheduled the same weekend that you usually do this and son in particular should have tried to shut this down before invites when out.", "Right! if she wanted to be closer to the family then she wouldn't be trying to steal his.   \n\nShe is TA. \n\nHe may need a neutral party to navigate all of this mess, because she is working on setting him up as the bad guy.", "The son asked his mother to be the bigger person , so I think he is aware that his wive is unreasonable but he doesn't want to rock the boat. Asking his mother to change the tradition is easier than telling his wive \"No\"", "Agree with all your points 100%! Op is NTA and Wendy needs to stay in her lane.", "Exactly! This was a power play and didn\u2019t pay out for them.", "Yeah DIL sounds like TA for trying to usurp OP's tradition. She's the one who made things uncomfortable by taking it upon herself on the same weekend without even asking if OP was OK with that. She was trying to compete with her MIL and knew exactly what she was doing. And as we like to say, she fucked around and found out.  NTA.", "[deleted]", "I find most chefs to be pretty pretentious", "Yup this. Couldn\u2019t say it better. NTA.", "If it's such a small deal to move the date back a week, she can easily move it back a week, too. Problem solved. \n\nI do wonder what the dish is. I want to try it now.", "I think DIL did it so people would say that hers is so much better than OPs.", "OP's son screwed this one up by not insisting on a different date spaced away from the two traditional days. He's the A here by not stopping this awkward situation. \n\nNTA", "Exactly. He literally only does it 2 days a year! And she has the nerve to do it close to one of them.. she is a huge sh*t disturbed and wants to create drama, control and manipulate OPs son. Good luck OP.... it only gets worse", "Not only the same weekend, but a day his mum couldn't attend due to work commitments", "Crawfish broil", "Because the DIL is a sneaky nasty power tripping, manipulative asshole", "This is my fav reply because it actually gives a way to mend the relationship and move forward. OP is clearly NTA but it seems if they don\u2019t want to fracture the family they will be the one that needs to stand up and explain to the kids why what they did was wrong. \n\nYou never stop being a parent lol.", "I really want to know too!", "Don't see how the second one is relevant. The dates are long standing amongst their family and DIL chose to send an invite out to the same people, for the same food, on the same long standing weekend.\n\nIt's unlikely the weekends were chosen for sentimental reasons TBH since it's the first weekend of the month every 6 months.\n\nFor your first point, they didn't go to hers, and she made the point before the weekend that people are unlikely to go to both because its not the kind of thing you eat two days in a row. Why would they expect her to go?", "because the DIL obviously picked that date to spite OP", "Also, if she wanted to be closer, she wouldn't have criticized her MIL's traditional recipe! DIL could have made it in the spring and fall instead.", "Cuz his wife is going to go ballistic on him!", "NTA she took YOUR tradition and tried to make it something for HER.", "NTA There are 52 weeks in a year. DIL could cook for the family other time. Seems she's trying to take over your tradition for some reason.", "NTA. They purposely chose a date to interfere with your longstanding tradition. They knew what they were doing. Don\u2019t roll over for them.", "Are you the DIL? If so the best way to handle this would have been to talk to your MIL, not try and upstage her. It's her tradition. \n\nI assume there is another side to this. It would be interesting to hear your side of the story.", "Baffled by DIL's actions. Is she trying to take over? Hijack? Belittle OP by \"doing it better\"? \nWhatever her motives... I dont think they're good ones.", "Absolutely, and then OP see you should\u2019ve taken my advice.", "Exactly.  It was 100% on purpose and an AH move on her part and op didn't fall for it. She can just pick another weekend and chose not to, or she could have made something light and complimentary to his weekend. How some families host light brunch days after a big dinner festive day. She chose it, because she wanted people to try her dish close to when ops dish would be served because she wanted people to say hers was better... bc she is a AH\n\nEdited for spelling and to add NTA", "NTA Wendy needs to find her own thing. The fact that people wanted to check and see if you were still doing your event shows that it is something people associate with you. She doesn\u2019t get to just boost it for herself.", "She had it in her head that her version of the meal would get more compliments than OP's, I'm sure."]}
