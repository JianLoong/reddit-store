I apologized profusely but they weren\u2019t having it. They said they wanted to speak to whoever my boss was and by this point, the child was inconsolable. Even some co-workers were saying that my comment was uncalled for and others even refused to speak to me. Now I\u2019m up at 2:43 am, dumbfounded, questioning if things really were that serious, and how the hell i\u2019m gonna get the courage to go to work again.

For some families they might laugh at that and other families may have the reaction you saw. Perhaps you should try and purge it from your phrase rolodex. But you obviously didn't mean it and apologized sincerely so I would just be more mindful in the future. Mostly you're the asshole for coming here and asking this because that does suggest that you think you're not in the wrong even after apologizing.", "This is a hard one since you clearly didn\u2019t mean to upset the child and family but I think you also need to be mindful of what you say to your patients and their families.\n\nSoft YTA because I do think you should have been more mindful while dealing with patients. I think your fellow doctors are worse for holding a small misuse of words against you so heavily", "I got in trouble when I worked at the cemetery, I said people are dying to get in.", "It doesn't really matter if it was intentional or not as people can unintentionally be AHs. This phrase was not okay to use.\n\nI'm doing a professional health degree now (not an MD) and they really stress what you shouldn't say when talking to patients. Even when getting a patient's history and they mention something good, we aren't supposed to say things like great or excellent because if I'm seeing this patient in hospital, they are in pain and/or dealing with a serious health issues and thus things are not great or excellent (it can be interpreted as minimizing the patients experience). \n\nYou know better. It slipped out of your mouth and yes, you didn't mean to cause harm, but it doesn't change the fact you did. Use this as a reminder and a learning experience. I can only imagine the level of guilt and anxiety this is causing you, but that doesn't absolve you of your assholery (but I bet you won't say something like this again). You as a person are not an AH because if this, but you were accidentally an AH in the moment. Intent is important, but so is impact... this is especially true when dealing with vulnerable patients.", "Welllll... yeah it was an AH comment but it is a common phrase.  I think that we expect our doctors and especially our children's doctors to be much more aware of what they are saying and how they say it.  \nSlip of the tongue doesn't make you an overall AH though. Seems like a genuine mistake that I doubt you would make again seeing the ramifications.  Prepare to keep apologizing though.", "YTA - but a soft YTA. Idk.. maybe a harsh YTA. Idk what the family or the patient has gone through. Maybe that joke would have been okay with an adult who you had a relationship with that involved giving sh-*t to each other whose recovering. But a child whose not expected to recover? And then grateful for some hope things would turn around. Wasn\u2019t appropriate. Especially with their family there whose gone through so much pain with dealing with their child\u2019s mortality being in such great question. Try to see it through their eyes. They were entrusting you with their terminally ill 10 yr old kid, and how that \u2018joke\u2019 would be taken.\n\nYou made a mistake with your words.

Imagine if it was your kid going through this and the doctor cracked that kind of joke and how hard that would be to take. Honestly I understand why that would destroy trust in you as their child\u2019s doctor and would be taken personal. But take it serious and show you can do better, and it shouldn\u2019t jeopardize your career.

The thing is, you have to take ownership over the impact of your actions, not just whether you intended that impact or not. His parents are right to be pissed.  You made their kid cry due to carelessness. What you did is similar to a med student saying \u201coh cool!\u201d to a patient with an academically interesting but otherwise life-altering and devastating diagnosis. Apologies help, but frankly when you meet with your chief about this, you should own the mistake and take whatever sensitivity training they recommend so that you are more cognizant of your phrasing in the future.", "This reminds me of that video of the guy trying to shake hands with the archer with no arms. Such a small/normal thing you don\u2019t think twice at that could just ruin everything.", "YTA. Accidentally so, and sincere apologies should rectify it, but yeah. You can\u2019t come on here and say you made a terminally ill 10yo cry with your words and expect any other verdict.", "NTA and everyone who votes 'YTA' has no idea how exhausting it is to be a doctor. Maintaining a professional demeanour while also trying to be as personable as possible with your patients is hard enough as it is, and you're having to do that on top of one of the most stressful jobs possible. OP likely has his turns of phrase that he uses to put patients at ease and to make them feel comfortable, this was one of them, and it's absolutely not fair for him to be dogpiled for letting it slip out in the wrong context. Doctors are human too.", "INFO...is there no training before working with children or terminally ill patients? I find it hard to believe that you don't eradicate phrases like this from your lexicon before doing this kind of work.", "YTA, and you know it.\n\nAnd while your job being on the line is harsh for a mistake, when you make such a mistake when dealing with anyone regardless of age who is in the situation your patient is in it is definitely not an over the top consequence.", "This one is tricky.   \nWith the right crowd your comment would have been well absorbed and rebounded (my kid would probably shoot back \u201cYeah, better than living ground hog day in here!\u201d).   \n\n\nAre you the AH for getting this wrong?

I appreciate that you made the comment without thinking about it. It was an honest mistake. But you job requires you to have thoughtful bedside manner with patients, which I imagine might be especially important with a young child who is terminally ill. Your comment clearly is causing anguish for this child at a time when he is likely experiencing a lot of trauma, not to mention his family.

You can be an a-hole without intending to be one. \n\nThere was a child who was terminal and he was fighting with everything he had.  He knew it was coming and it was working on his bucket list.

We need you!", "NTA: yes, your comment was incredibly hurtful and gross. BUT, accidents happen and you apologized. I have a terminally ill child and people say hurtful and gross things to us all the time and every experience with death is different. I'm not sure I would have have the same reaction as this family, but my job is to love my child and teach her to love herself and a lot of the time that means that I teach her that it's ok for people to make mistakes and to let them make amends. *just like I would want people to allow her to do*. \n\nNavigating pain doesn't mean trying to make every one feel as much pain as you do. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this, im sorry that family is going through what they are going through.

Just live with the cringe and be better next time.", "NTA. It's a common saying and you just weren't really thinking about it. I can understand the family being upset but personally in this situation I wouldn't escalate it so high, I'd just as you to please leave the room. If it was clear you didn't mean it maliciously or you weren't trying to crack a joke, it's okay.\n\nWith that said, I totally cannot understand people around you telling you that you're an asshole and coworkers refusing to talk to you over what was clearly an accident. People make mistakes. I once was asked by family of a dementia patient how he's been today and I said \"he's been a little ornery\". While the descriptor was true, it wasn't really the kindest way to phrase what I was trying to say. The wife took offense and challenged me to explain what I meant and at that moment I was like a deer in headlights because I realized that what I said didn't sound all that nice. Luckily the son just recognized what happened and stepped in, I apologized and they went on about their visit.\n\nPoint is to always try and remain cognizant of your speech around patients, and think about the most sensitive ways of phrasing things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You put your foot very far in your mouth, but apologize profusely and explain everything to your boss as well as tell them you\u2019ll be making a tremendous effort to not let something like that happen and not use the word dying anytime outside of a serious conversation. Mistakes happen and unfortunately this happened to be a big one. The family is upset because their whole life is turned upside down, the patient is inconsolable because he\u2019s terrified and cannot fully process everything happening to him and around him.

I don't know where you are but where I am people who work in high stress environments usually develop a pretty bleak sense of humour, you would have been ragged mercilessly about it not only because it was an absolutely appalling unintentional pun but also to alleviate some of that guilt that simply won't serve you going forwards (for example, you are up at 2.30am mulling it over instead of getting enough rest to serve your patients at full capacity tomorrow). We are human. We err. The family's grief is understandable and their emotions and sensitivity will undoubtedly be high.

Fellow doctor here. \n\nWith the number of patients I see daily, I\u2019m routinely multitasking to my limit. I\u2019ve got the patient in front of me, I\u2019m thinking about a previous patient that I may have missed something on, an X-ray I need to review, the labs I need to order, and the insurance company I need to do a damn peer to peer with because insurance companies are the real assholes. \n\nMore than once, I\u2019ve said something dumb to a patient. Sometimes I think I\u2019m seeing patient A, but I\u2019ve walked into patient B\u2019s room. Sometimes I walk into a room that should be happy (patient is doing better!), but realize I minute later I\u2019m in a room where I\u2019ll be delivering bad news. Sometimes I slip and say something out of habit because it\u2019s part of my standard delivery, but it\u2019s not appropriate for the patient in front of me and now I\u2019ve lost their trust. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s my fault. Sometimes it\u2019s circumstances.\n\nKeep your head up. Accidents and mistakes happen, but you had no ill intent. But you\u2019re still needed to the next patient. It\u2019s happened to all of us to a certain degree at some point in time.", "He's a doctor working with terminally ill children you'd think he'd be able to watch what he says", "That\u2019s literally his job to be sensitive to patients needs\u2026 and a terminal one no less !! HUGE AH", "Well that\u2019s correct in theory but I can assure you when your stressed, uncomfortable and just trying to make conversation sometimes the wrong words can emerge. I\u2019ve been a nurse for 30 years. All he can do is apologize and move on. It happens\u2026.we\u2019re human.", "Omg that video gets me every time haha. Or the wedding video where the bride is in a wheelchair and the DJ puts on that Ed Sheeran song *'when your legs don't work when they used to before'* :')", "The problem with this is that it\u2019s also pretty exhausting to be a terminally ill kid.\n\nWe all fuck up. Those of us in healthcare are human. But sometimes you just have to acknowledge that you were 100% TA.  You can be TA and still be a good doctor and a good human. \n\nImpact > intent.", "If your turn of phrase to put terminally ill children at ease includes the word dying you need to reassess your phrases", "Critical care nurse here- he\u2019s an asshole. It wasn\u2019t intentional, but you have to learn not to say certain phrases at work. I think the family is taking it too far, but they are going through a stressful and emotional time.\n\nEdit: typo", "It doesn't matter how exhausted one is. It's an absolutely insensitive faux pas especially to say it to a kid who doesn't understand cultural idioms!! This phrase should not be in a doctor's lexicon toolbox. Full stop. Obviously an innocent mistake, but this isn't an \"Did I Make An Innocent Mistake\" sub. \n\nHopefully the parents will realize this was an innocent, although highly insensitive, error in judgment. Learning opportunity for the OP for sure.", "Doctors are humans too. And humans are unintentionally assholes sometimes. I know exactly how exhausting it is to be a doctor, and I sometimes fuck up my phrasing. But at the end of the day, I don\u2019t try to make excuses or defend my fuck ups. I try to learn from them. Don\u2019t you? This guy in this situation was an AH. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s always an AH or isn\u2019t an all around good guy, but we all need to take responsibility for the (highly predictable) impact of our actions and not just our intentions.", "Everyone voting N T A don't know how hard it is to see your child dying or for the kid to face death while you also know how heartbroken your parents are. The kid doesn't choose to die at the age of ten, and I can promise you that the parents don't want this either. But OP chose to be a professional. If he can't be a professional in such basic situation with a KID, he shouldn't be one at all.", "Lol. No. Every profession is exhausting. Doctors don't get a pass. If you are using a turn phrase without first assessing the situation, YTA. He even doubled down by saying it's not a big deal. It IS a big deal to this kid. His days are numbered, and Dr. McEvil just made one of those days shittier.", "SAME!!", "For sure not malicious, and a mistake, but yeah I wouldn\u2019t take it well if that was said by my child\u2019s doctor to my child. Something a bit more emotional about a child with a terminal illness than an adult I feel!", "I hate how stretched health care is in so many places, this is so terrifying and disconcerting...", "idk, my Childs geneticist was an absolute genius but had the social skills of a feral mongoose. we cant always expect the people that are in our lives to help us solve specific problems be equipped to navigate every situation perfectly. Yes, docs in these situations should learn how to navigate this, but I would also prefer an excellent doc that may have issues navigating social situations than the opposite.", "He may be a *new* to this career doctor. Everyone has to start somewhere. He knows he misspoke. Why pile on to make him feel worse?", "Have actually never met a doc who could interact with human beings on any level so I\u2019m not surprised", "His job is to fix his patients' medical problems, to make them get better and not be sick anymore. It's like you've never seen House.", ">That\u2019s literally his job to be sensitive to patients needs\u2026\n\nNo, his job is to provide the best possible medical care to heal his patient.", "Or your profession.", "That\u2019s perfect. Nobody is asking for perfection but some humility would be awesome.", "I work with a lot of doctors and this! None of my doctor's are assholes all of the time,  but sometimes asshole behavior comes out. They don't use the fact they are doctor's as a reason for being an asshole. They all or should own up to the fact they made a mistake and will try to do better. Hell  I've made some asshole assanine comment without thinking to a patient before. I immediately apologized and then sent a team's message to my supervisor to let them know what happened just in case a complaint came through. I got lucky, they laughed it off and my supervisor told me to just be more aware of my wording, which I am.", "Mistakes happen. The doc coughed up a major furball. Better a mistake with his mouth than a mistake in surgery.", "Do you really think every profession requires someone to be on shift for 72 hours straight? Juggling life-changing responsibilities and tasks on 2 hours sleep? Being on call overnight and ready to get out of bed at 3am for an emergency? You're either being deliberately obtuse or you have no idea what you're talking about. Expecting people who work under those conditions to be perfect 100% of the time in spite of their physical/mental exhaustion and never slip up is just ridiculous. There are actual doctors in this thread, read their experiences.", "I hope there\u2019s either a dentist or a podiatrist on staff to help OP remove the foot from their mouth.", "I like the ones that have learnt to mimic the patient (me). Reflect my body language, it's a fun game. Lean left. Lean right. Rub face.", "House was a huge dick, that\u2019s a fuckin TV show\u2026. This was a REAL boy who\u2019s doctor made a sly comment about dying. \nWhat an insensitive asshole. I can\u2019t believe how many people are defending this guy\u2026. Worlds gone to shit.", "Yes, but making sure you don\u2019t say inappropriate things and not being insensitive with your patients is also what\u2019s expected here..", "Oh please. Stop. Doctors know what they are signing up for. Don't want that life, don't be a doctor and receive the fat paycheck for what you do.", "When I was a young nurse I ask a coworker I hadn\u2019t seen for a while in the elevator when her baby was due. She had been trying for years. She looked 9 months  pregnant. She burst into tears because she had stomach cancer. I needed a dentist, podiatrist and surgeon to stitch my mouth shut. Never asked that question again to this day.", "Expectation, yes. Job requirement? No. At the end of the day, the doctor is human and misspoke; apparently, you never have. Congratulations."]}
