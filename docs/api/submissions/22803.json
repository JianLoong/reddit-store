I apologized profusely but they weren\u2019t having it. They said they wanted to speak to whoever my boss was and by this point, the child was inconsolable. Even some co-workers were saying that my comment was uncalled for and others even refused to speak to me.

For some families they might laugh at that and other families may have the reaction you saw. Perhaps you should try and purge it from your phrase rolodex. But you obviously didn't mean it and apologized sincerely so I would just be more mindful in the future. Mostly you're the asshole for coming here and asking this because that does suggest that you think you're not in the wrong even after apologizing.", "This is a hard one since you clearly didn\u2019t mean to upset the child and family but I think you also need to be mindful of what you say to your patients and their families.\n\nSoft YTA because I do think you should have been more mindful while dealing with patients. I think your fellow doctors are worse for holding a small misuse of words against you so heavily", "I got in trouble when I worked at the cemetery, I said people are dying to get in.", "It doesn't really matter if it was intentional or not as people can unintentionally be AHs. This phrase was not okay to use.\n\nI'm doing a professional health degree now (not an MD) and they really stress what you shouldn't say when talking to patients. Even when getting a patient's history and they mention something good, we aren't supposed to say things like great or excellent because if I'm seeing this patient in hospital, they are in pain and/or dealing with a serious health issues and thus things are not great or excellent (it can be interpreted as minimizing the patients experience). \n\nYou know better. It slipped out of your mouth and yes, you didn't mean to cause harm, but it doesn't change the fact you did. Use this as a reminder and a learning experience. I can only imagine the level of guilt and anxiety this is causing you, but that doesn't absolve you of your assholery (but I bet you won't say something like this again). You as a person are not an AH because if this, but you were accidentally an AH in the moment. Intent is important, but so is impact... this is especially true when dealing with vulnerable patients.", "Welllll... yeah it was an AH comment but it is a common phrase.  I think that we expect our doctors and especially our children's doctors to be much more aware of what they are saying and how they say it.  \nSlip of the tongue doesn't make you an overall AH though. Seems like a genuine mistake that I doubt you would make again seeing the ramifications.  Prepare to keep apologizing though.", "YTA - but a soft YTA. Idk.. maybe a harsh YTA. Idk what the family or the patient has gone through. Maybe that joke would have been okay with an adult who you had a relationship with that involved giving sh-*t to each other whose recovering. But a child whose not expected to recover? And then grateful for some hope things would turn around. Wasn\u2019t appropriate. Especially with their family there whose gone through so much pain with dealing with their child\u2019s mortality being in such great question. Try to see it through their eyes.

Imagine if it was your kid going through this and the doctor cracked that kind of joke and how hard that would be to take. Honestly I understand why that would destroy trust in you as their child\u2019s doctor and would be taken personal.

The thing is, you have to take ownership over the impact of your actions, not just whether you intended that impact or not. His parents are right to be pissed.  You made their kid cry due to carelessness. What you did is similar to a med student saying \u201coh cool!\u201d to a patient with an academically interesting but otherwise life-altering and devastating diagnosis. Apologies help, but frankly when you meet with your chief about this, you should own the mistake and take whatever sensitivity training they recommend so that you are more cognizant of your phrasing in the future.", "This reminds me of that video of the guy trying to shake hands with the archer with no arms.

You can\u2019t come on here and say you made a terminally ill 10yo cry with your words and expect any other verdict.", "NTA and everyone who votes 'YTA' has no idea how exhausting it is to be a doctor. Maintaining a professional demeanour while also trying to be as personable as possible with your patients is hard enough as it is, and you're having to do that on top of one of the most stressful jobs possible. OP likely has his turns of phrase that he uses to put patients at ease and to make them feel comfortable, this was one of them, and it's absolutely not fair for him to be dogpiled for letting it slip out in the wrong context. Doctors are human too.", "INFO...is there no training before working with children or terminally ill patients? I find it hard to believe that you don't eradicate phrases like this from your lexicon before doing this kind of work.", "YTA, and you know it.\n\nAnd while your job being on the line is harsh for a mistake, when you make such a mistake when dealing with anyone regardless of age who is in the situation your patient is in it is definitely not an over the top consequence.", "This one is tricky.   \nWith the right crowd your comment would have been well absorbed and rebounded (my kid would probably shoot back \u201cYeah, better than living ground hog day in here!\u201d).   \n\n\nAre you the AH for getting this wrong?

I appreciate that you made the comment without thinking about it. It was an honest mistake. But you job requires you to have thoughtful bedside manner with patients, which I imagine might be especially important with a young child who is terminally ill.

You can be an a-hole without intending to be one. \n\nThere was a child who was terminal and he was fighting with everything he had.  He knew it was coming and it was working on his bucket list.

We need you!", "NTA: yes, your comment was incredibly hurtful and gross. BUT, accidents happen and you apologized. I have a terminally ill child and people say hurtful and gross things to us all the time and every experience with death is different. I'm not sure I would have have the same reaction as this family, but my job is to love my child and teach her to love herself and a lot of the time that means that I teach her that it's ok for people to make mistakes and to let them make amends. *just like I would want people to allow her to do*. \n\nNavigating pain doesn't mean trying to make every one feel as much pain as you do. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this, im sorry that family is going through what they are going through.

Just live with the cringe and be better next time.", "NTA. It's a common saying and you just weren't really thinking about it. I can understand the family being upset but personally in this situation I wouldn't escalate it so high, I'd just as you to please leave the room. If it was clear you didn't mean it maliciously or you weren't trying to crack a joke, it's okay.\n\nWith that said, I totally cannot understand people around you telling you that you're an asshole and coworkers refusing to talk to you over what was clearly an accident. People make mistakes. I once was asked by family of a dementia patient how he's been today and I said \"he's been a little ornery\". While the descriptor was true, it wasn't really the kindest way to phrase what I was trying to say. The wife took offense and challenged me to explain what I meant and at that moment I was like a deer in headlights because I realized that what I said didn't sound all that nice. Luckily the son just recognized what happened and stepped in, I apologized and they went on about their visit.\n\nPoint is to always try and remain cognizant of your speech around patients, and think about the most sensitive ways of phrasing things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You put your foot very far in your mouth, but apologize profusely and explain everything to your boss as well as tell them you\u2019ll be making a tremendous effort to not let something like that happen and not use the word dying anytime outside of a serious conversation. Mistakes happen and unfortunately this happened to be a big one. The family is upset because their whole life is turned upside down, the patient is inconsolable because he\u2019s terrified and cannot fully process everything happening to him and around him.

I don't know where you are but where I am people who work in high stress environments usually develop a pretty bleak sense of humour, you would have been ragged mercilessly about it not only because it was an absolutely appalling unintentional pun but also to alleviate some of that guilt that simply won't serve you going forwards (for example, you are up at 2.30am mulling it over instead of getting enough rest to serve your patients at full capacity tomorrow). We are human. We err. The family's grief is understandable and their emotions and sensitivity will undoubtedly be high.

This kid needs to know that you, who he associates with the thing killing him, see him as a little boy you care about and that you don't have a flippant attitude about him dying, and if he does make it out, he'll have a reminder of a caring doctor continuing by his side.\n\nKnowing you'll be trying will give you the courage to go back, the space to grow, and the grace to forgive yourself. Kids are immensely resilient and forgiving, but more so when they feel seen. You can't undo something, but you can choose how you leave it.

And sometimes they decide not to/are less able to use their considerable situational awareness, sometimes because of burnout and lack of sleep, sometimes because they don\u2019t feel like it. And of course, the burnout/sleep deprivation lapses I don\u2019t think are a choice, and are rather mistakes.

But because Person A was on their mind (when they were texting), they accidentally send the text to Person A - rather than Person B. \n\nBut due to the nature of medical work (and vulnerability of the patients), simple human falliability is often going to have worse results than, say, a librarian's mistake. A book might get misfiled, if the librarian mixes up bar codes in their head - and therefore makes a small error. But a small error for a doctor, can have far more devastating results.\n\nHe's not the only one, though. Doctors have said some right humdingers to me at times, also. And I read about a doctor who made a similar mistake to OP. She was using an old ultrasound machine (which kept failing), in a maternity ward. As she was using it on a woman giving birth, the machine failed again. So the doctor said outloud to other staff: 'it's died'. You can imagine the panic that caused the labouring mother, who didn't know the machine had failed. \n\nReally, the only thing OP can do, is remain apologetic and not minimise the family's pain about the comment. The family are already under horrific stress, so it's important to recognise the devastation such a comment could cause in these circumstances.
