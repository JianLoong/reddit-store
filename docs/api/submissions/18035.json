The CashApp is a good start.\n\nI hope you\u2019re okay. Being disrespected like that by someone you\u2019re supposed to be able to trust hurts, no matter what it\u2019s about.", "NTA - Hes a huge AH for this and this was very immature.", "NTA. You told him repeatedly not to do this. He did it anyway and completely dismissed your feelings about it. Of course he feels bad about it now, and it's good that he's paying you back, but the money isn't the issue. The issue is him ignoring your request and thinking that acting this way is funny. He needs to get it through his head that this isn't ok.", "NTA. You told him it was serious to you and that\u2019s all he needed to know to not do that. I\u2019m a black woman as well so I completely understand your reaction and your anger. I do think it\u2019s worth explaining to him in detail when you\u2019re less upset and hope he\u2019ll understand the importance from now on.

I would be incredibly pissed if I specifically asked someone to respect a certain boundary and they thought it was funny to violate it.\n\nIs it common for him to tease you about being a perfectionist? And if so, do you typically laugh along with him? If that's the case, I'd give him a little grace in that he figured this was another thing where you are perhaps over the top. It is also good he sent you money; it sounds like he has done some reflecting and realized he fucked up.\n\nBut if he is frequently giving you crap about being a perfectionist and you aren't laughing along with him, then he's probably too immature to respect your needs/boundaries. And by sending you money he probably thinks he \"fixed\" the issue.", "NTA- oh my god. \n\nI would tell your boyfriend that you cannot move forward with this relationship until he educates himself about black hair. That what he did was extremely disrespectful. And it is not a big deal to him because he doesn\u2019t understand the work, money and time that goes into it. So until he educates himself and apologizes from a place of actually understanding why this was a big deal- you have a problem. \n\nAlso-\nReagan Elizabeth Jackson wrote a great poem about her hair called \u201cNot your Afro-American Petting Zoo\u201d you might like reading that right about now.", "NTA, YOU DID NOT OVERREACT!!! Listen boyfriend or not apart of my culture or not if I tell you don't touch my hair and don't do it. It's the audacity of him to think that just cause he don't think it's a big deal it's not.  If you are really considering staying in the relationship make him go to the salon with you and sit there the entire time you get your hair done, and don't let him sleep.  In fact scratch his head and then give him a perm. He will understand don't touch a Black Woman's crown!", "NTA - That was a really crappy thing to do.  It's fair to be angry.  It's also cool that he sent you money to get it redone.  He sounds remorseful.  Being angry was fair, but so is forgiveness if you're up to it.", " NTA. Don\u2019t let someone gaslight you! That was cruel and toxic. It is NOT FUNNY! Your feelings matter. Again sis, YOUR FEELINGS MATTER. That was very inconsiderate to say the least.

And now you know, determine how people feel about you by how they treat your hair, how ever it decides to shapeshift.", "NTA\n\nHe wouldn't respect a very basic and reasonable boundary you had, you just wanted him to leave your hair alone. I worry about his possible lack of respect of other, more important boundaries you may have. He could be remorseful in a genuine way by sending you money to get it redone, and hopefully he apologizes in a sincere way, but something's off about why he didn't respect your wishes in the first place.", "Nta and I would use the money he sent to get it redone. I would reach out to him and thank him for the money to get it redone because the fact he sent u that money means that he realizes now that it is a big deal and won't do it in the future. I would forgive him and talk about it out with him. I'm sure he's really sorry and really didn't think it was that big of a deal and he learned a big lesson in the relationship.

Never, ever, in the 11 years we\u2019ve been together, has he *ever* even joked about disrespecting me like that. Anyone saying that he didn\u2019t understand - it doesn\u2019t take first hand knowledge, especially when you told him repeatedly. It has nothing to do with his race, and everything to do with his lack of respect for you. \n\nIf he is genuinely contrite, can identify what he did wrong and why it was wrong, and promises to never do it again, I would consider giving him a second chance.

He didn\u2019t care. And people can only treat you as you allow them.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry girl, because appointments (and good dudes) can be difficult to get sometimes.", "NTA.

But if I was dating you, I wouldn't need to.

You set a boundary and he chose to ignore it. It was an expensive service, and so at least he gave you the money to get it again, but that doesn't fix the problem. \n\nIt doesn't matter if something isn't important or serious to him, he should've respected you regardless. \n\nYou haven't overreacted at all, and based on him saying \"didn't think it was a big deal\" while you're freaking out, makes me think that he doesn't regret his actions at all. \n\nNTA.", "Nta you specifically told him what not to do. You only asked that he respect you, and he decided to act like a literal bully child who's mad you paid attention to yourself.", "NTA you're totally not overreacting. He completely disrespected everything you said to him.\n\nHe legitimately needs to educate himself on the process of taking care of and styling hair like yours. I'm super white, but have started watching the process of black people taking care of and styling their hair.... and Holy shit dude the process of just regular daily care can be a lot of work by itself. \n\nBut the process/work and *fuckin cost* of styling black hair is insane. That shit is impressive for a reason, and takes unbelievable amounts of time, money, and attention to detail. Your bf needs educated BIG TIME cause he does not at all understand the entirety of black hair care.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a high school teacher, and if I had nickel for every time something like this happened to one of my students\u2026well, I\u2019d probably be able to afford a better vacation this summer. Anyway, it seems like he was just teasing you, but it is more than ok to get mad and cry when that happened.\n\nIt\u2019s nice that he sent you money to get your hair re-done, but you need to actually talk to him about this. I, admittedly, know absolutely nothing about women\u2019s hair care, but I know (and try to teach male students) how much women can care about their hair. When something like this is close to happening in my classroom, I ask the guy if he\u2019d like it if I scuffed up his new Jordans. When he says no, I tell him that to the girl he was teasing that her hair was just like his Jordans (even though she also probably had them), and that usually got them to understand. Maybe something like that can better help your boyfriend understand why even teasing you like that isn\u2019t right.", "NTA... but if he is truly repentant of his ignorance, it might be time to forgive. I take it he sent you the money without being asked?", "NTA. To me it's similar to depriving you of your bodily autonomy. Today it's your hair, what's next? Hiding your favorite outfit/ jeans so you can't wear them out of the house because you look too good in them? Poke holes in your diaphragm or his rubbers because he wants to knock you up? That's a deal breaker for me.", "NTA\n\nAnd paying for a new blow out is only step one. \n\nStep two is he has to spend the time you are sitting at the stylist doing NOTHING (no games, books, phone etc) because you\u2019re stuck doing nothing. \n\nStep three is to make up for the disrespect and waste of your time for having to spend more time getting your hair done a second time by planning a relaxing (or fun, your choice) afternoon for you. \n\nThis way he will understand the cost involved, the time involved, and hopefully the relaxing or fun afternoon will allow for reconnecting and will help him never cross boundaries again.", "Well, you're both pretty young and he was being totally stupid. Your reaction was a bit over the top. Good for him for sending money right away. Don't throw away a great relationship over a minute of stupidity. NTA for getting angry and upset, but hopefully he's learned you are serious about your hair and you can forgive him.", "NTA \n\n<<<he seemed to really like my hair, and i gave him the usual run down of what he can and cannot do around it, but i put a lot more emphasis on not playing in it and>>>\n\nUsual?  Did he not get the message the first time?  No, clearly not.  \n\nThat was out right malicious.   It wasn't funny in the least.", "NTA - this was a hate crime. \ud83d\ude02 i appreciate that he sent money to have it fixed however, if he truly cares about you he should respect your boundaries always.", "NTA. If he had accidentally spilled water when reaching for it or something I wouldn\u2019t say this is a breakup-able offense.. but he was deliberate. He doesn\u2019t take it seriously which means he doesn\u2019t take YOU seriously. No one messes with my hair when I blow it out and I don\u2019t get it professionally done, nor is my hair as curly.
