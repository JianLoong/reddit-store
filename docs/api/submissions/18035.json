i\u2019m african american as i stated, and i grew up around a lot of black women who taught me how to care for my hair, and that i should treasure it. he is white, and he grew up in an area that\u2019s 50/50 when it comes to white and other POC population, if that makes any sense. we come from completely different backgrounds, he only recently became exposed to black culture when he transferred to our high school (70% black there), and started being friends with/dating me. he has bone straight hair, mine is 4a. as you can see, we\u2019re very different. i thought it would be important to bring race into it to give some context as to why i was initially angry and upset at him. i\u2019m not sure how to respond to the people saying that i shouldn\u2019t bring race into it.\n\n**3.** \u201cdoes he make fun of you for your perfectionism often, and are you laughing with him?\u201d\n\nyes and yes. when he makes fun of me, i never thought it was to be genuinely mean (although i\u2019m starting to overthink that now), and i usually get on him about something silly back, like his outfit or something he does weird, like the way he eats pizza or something stupid like that. where i\u2019m from we call it joaning lol.\n\ni appreciate everyone who commented, even the people who weren\u2019t that nice to me. i\u2019ll update again once i talk to him.", "created_utc": 1684896178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q8so6/aita_for_getting_mad_and_crying_when_my_boyfriend/", "score": 1980, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You told him repeatedly not to do this. He did it anyway and completely dismissed your feelings about it. Of course he feels bad about it now, and it's good that he's paying you back, but the money isn't the issue. The issue is him ignoring your request and thinking that acting this way is funny. He needs to get it through his head that this isn't ok.", "NTA. You told him it was serious to you and that\u2019s all he needed to know to not do that. I\u2019m a black woman as well so I completely understand your reaction and your anger.

I would be incredibly pissed if I specifically asked someone to respect a certain boundary and they thought it was funny to violate it.\n\nIs it common for him to tease you about being a perfectionist? And if so, do you typically laugh along with him? If that's the case, I'd give him a little grace in that he figured this was another thing where you are perhaps over the top. It is also good he sent you money; it sounds like he has done some reflecting and realized he fucked up.\n\nBut if he is frequently giving you crap about being a perfectionist and you aren't laughing along with him, then he's probably too immature to respect your needs/boundaries. And by sending you money he probably thinks he \"fixed\" the issue.", "NTA- oh my god. \n\nI would tell your boyfriend that you cannot move forward with this relationship until he educates himself about black hair. That what he did was extremely disrespectful. And it is not a big deal to him because he doesn\u2019t understand the work, money and time that goes into it. So until he educates himself and apologizes from a place of actually understanding why this was a big deal- you have a problem. \n\nAlso-\nReagan Elizabeth Jackson wrote a great poem about her hair called \u201cNot your Afro-American Petting Zoo\u201d you might like reading that right about now.", "NTA, YOU DID NOT OVERREACT!!! Listen boyfriend or not apart of my culture or not if I tell you don't touch my hair and don't do it. It's the audacity of him to think that just cause he don't think it's a big deal it's not.  If you are really considering staying in the relationship make him go to the salon with you and sit there the entire time you get your hair done, and don't let him sleep.  In fact scratch his head and then give him a perm. He will understand don't touch a Black Woman's crown!", "NTA - That was a really crappy thing to do.  It's fair to be angry.  It's also cool that he sent you money to get it redone.  He sounds remorseful.  Being angry was fair, but so is forgiveness if you're up to it.", " NTA. Don\u2019t let someone gaslight you!

And now you know, determine how people feel about you by how they treat your hair, how ever it decides to shapeshift.", "NTA\n\nHe wouldn't respect a very basic and reasonable boundary you had, you just wanted him to leave your hair alone. I worry about his possible lack of respect of other, more important boundaries you may have.

I would reach out to him and thank him for the money to get it redone because the fact he sent u that money means that he realizes now that it is a big deal and won't do it in the future. I would forgive him and talk about it out with him. I'm sure he's really sorry and really didn't think it was that big of a deal and he learned a big lesson in the relationship.

Never, ever, in the 11 years we\u2019ve been together, has he *ever* even joked about disrespecting me like that. Anyone saying that he didn\u2019t understand - it doesn\u2019t take first hand knowledge, especially when you told him repeatedly. It has nothing to do with his race, and everything to do with his lack of respect for you. \n\nIf he is genuinely contrite, can identify what he did wrong and why it was wrong, and promises to never do it again, I would consider giving him a second chance.

You set a boundary and he chose to ignore it. It was an expensive service, and so at least he gave you the money to get it again, but that doesn't fix the problem. \n\nIt doesn't matter if something isn't important or serious to him, he should've respected you regardless. \n\nYou haven't overreacted at all, and based on him saying \"didn't think it was a big deal\" while you're freaking out, makes me think that he doesn't regret his actions at all. \n\nNTA.", "Nta you specifically told him what not to do. You only asked that he respect you, and he decided to act like a literal bully child who's mad you paid attention to yourself.", "NTA you're totally not overreacting. He completely disrespected everything you said to him.\n\nHe legitimately needs to educate himself on the process of taking care of and styling hair like yours. I'm super white, but have started watching the process of black people taking care of and styling their hair.... and Holy shit dude the process of just regular daily care can be a lot of work by itself. \n\nBut the process/work and *fuckin cost* of styling black hair is insane.

Anyway, it seems like he was just teasing you, but it is more than ok to get mad and cry when that happened.\n\nIt\u2019s nice that he sent you money to get your hair re-done, but you need to actually talk to him about this. I, admittedly, know absolutely nothing about women\u2019s hair care, but I know (and try to teach male students) how much women can care about their hair. When something like this is close to happening in my classroom, I ask the guy if he\u2019d like it if I scuffed up his new Jordans. When he says no, I tell him that to the girl he was teasing that her hair was just like his Jordans (even though she also probably had them), and that usually got them to understand. Maybe something like that can better help your boyfriend understand why even teasing you like that isn\u2019t right.", "NTA... but if he is truly repentant of his ignorance, it might be time to forgive. I take it he sent you the money without being asked?", "NTA. To me it's similar to depriving you of your bodily autonomy. Today it's your hair, what's next? Hiding your favorite outfit/ jeans so you can't wear them out of the house because you look too good in them? Poke holes in your diaphragm or his rubbers because he wants to knock you up? That's a deal breaker for me.", "NTA\n\nAnd paying for a new blow out is only step one. \n\nStep two is he has to spend the time you are sitting at the stylist doing NOTHING (no games, books, phone etc) because you\u2019re stuck doing nothing. \n\nStep three is to make up for the disrespect and waste of your time for having to spend more time getting your hair done a second time by planning a relaxing (or fun, your choice) afternoon for you. \n\nThis way he will understand the cost involved, the time involved, and hopefully the relaxing or fun afternoon will allow for reconnecting and will help him never cross boundaries again.", "Well, you're both pretty young and he was being totally stupid. Your reaction was a bit over the top. Good for him for sending money right away. Don't throw away a great relationship over a minute of stupidity. NTA for getting angry and upset, but hopefully he's learned you are serious about your hair and you can forgive him.", "NTA \n\n<<<he seemed to really like my hair, and i gave him the usual run down of what he can and cannot do around it, but i put a lot more emphasis on not playing in it and>>>\n\nUsual?

If he had accidentally spilled water when reaching for it or something I wouldn\u2019t say this is a breakup-able offense.. but he was deliberate. He doesn\u2019t take it seriously which means he doesn\u2019t take YOU seriously. No one messes with my hair when I blow it out and I don\u2019t get it professionally done, nor is my hair as curly.

You, it sounds like out of care and fondness, have been teaching him about black hair, which is a huge topic. And hugely culturally and emotionally fraught in many ways and for many people, not to mention personally important to you. Not only does it sound like he hasn't done much by way of learning about something that can impact you your whole life/something you're passionate about and that makes you happy and feel good about yourself, but it also sounds like you're undermining your own ability and validity in being emotionally tied to it. *You're allowed to be upset when someone does something hurtful to you, even (especially) if it's someone who is meant to care about you. Harm from strangers hurts but even accidental harm from someone trusted can feel like betrayal.* The money is a start, but you're allowed time to consider and do whatever makes you feel whole. Meanwhile, he should be working on why he feels okay with no only poking at something his girlfriend values like this, but also how Black hair is one of the very visible and tangible differences between you and he in experience of how to take care of and love on someone.

But if boundary-pushing or disrespect are a pattern, that is a HUGE red flag.", "well, i\u2019m not sure what to tell you.", "it\u2019s not like it\u2019s an attachment, it\u2019s more of a culture thing. but thank you anyway.", "How was she wrong for asking him not to do some thing, and being upset when he does the things she requested he not do? He was physically on her with a bottle of water and spilled it on her when she was trying to get out of his grasp. How was she at all at fault?\n\nAttachment to hair? Meaning that she went and paid her money and spent her time for a service that he ruined for no apparent reason? \n\nI would really love to know how she\u2019s the asshole.", "Honest question, do you just not go outside in the rain or wash your hair for a long period of time after something like this?", "It is important to know the race, yt people are so ignorant sometimes. Black hair requires so much more effort that white hair. if it was 2 white people , the girl could have dried off the hair and it would look somewhat presentable. But if u have natural hair and it gets wet after a press, it's completely different and unmanageable. I wouldn't even want to go in public unless I hide it", "Like I said, everyone has some fault\n\nShe's too attached to simple hair\n\nHe didn't listen well enough\n\nShe freaked out way too much\n\nHe thought its just simple normal couple fun\n\nBoth need to comunicate and accept their shortcoming", "From my personal experience when i go out in the rain i take precautions to make sure my hair does not get wet by any means necessary. As for washing, most black people especially with 4B/4C hair wash their hair usually weekly or biweekly compared to those with straight hair who wash it nearly daily, so a blowout can stretch for 2-3 weeks especially if you are not in a humid climate.", "Yeah, like forking over the money to fix it, without having to be chased over it, shows me that he's sorry and has learned his lesson. 150 is a decent chunk of money for an 18 yr old. If everything else in the relationship is more or less good then I see no harm in forgiving him.\n\nReddit likes to come down hard, but we all make mistakes and I'm sure most of us have done something stupid that we regret.", "Are you familiar with African-American hair? Do you know the care it takes to achieve certain styles? \n\nDo you also know that OP can\u2019t **simply** go have her hair redone as it would cause damage to it? \n\nShe communicated her boundaries around her hair, and he disrespected them, so again what exactly is OP at fault for?", "So you're going to want to wait it out - I'd recommend you consult with the person who did your blow out to see what they suggest, since they know the precise process they followed (as with most things, different people and places have different processes).\n\nHe disrespected you, he didn't take you seriously. Males of all ages have a tendency to do this, to be goofy and silly, and we women tend to love that about them up until they cross the line.  And at this young age? He really hasn't figured out where the line is.  It's going to take him a long time to figure it all out, seriously, it's a lifetime process, but as long as he's learning from mistakes then he's moving in the right direction.  It does sound like he's properly remorseful, and sending the money to make reparations for his mistakes is good too. \n\nIf you're willing to talk it over with him, I think there's hope here.  Some quality communication to say \"now you know I never joke about my hair. And now you know if I say something is off limits I mean it, I'm not playing around.\"  If he can accept that and respect it, then you're good to go to work on forgiving him.\n\nOh, and no matter how much impact that water had: you're still absolutely beautiful!", "Interesting. I didn\u2019t even know there were classifications for curly hair.", "Depends on if they actually spray. If they don\u2019t, then sure. Not a good joke, but yes, it\u2019s an attempt at a joke even if I don\u2019t find it funny.\n\nIf I grab them in a way that forces them to actually spray, then that is at least a little bit my fault.", "here we go just pulling the racist card when you know only a sliver of info about the guy, get the hell out of here with that shit.", "yeah he doesn\u2019t respect you, your bodily autonomy, your boundaries, or consent", "[deleted]", "My mother has 3c hair\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fstill its only hair \n\nNever in 50 years has she acted this way\n\nThis girl needs to realise its silly behaviour and find a compromise \n\nBoundaries lmao, its only hair", "I literally responded to someone saying \"N A H\", so they didn't think OP's bf was ultimately an asshole despite the transgression of him ignoring boundaries. My entire comment was just trying to refute that notion that the bf could in any way, shape or form be considered not an asshole.", "Oh please. I swear people just love acting like black women overreact.  Fact of the matter is, the \"let's ruin a black girl's hair and expose her real texture and waste her time and money for laughs\" has been a cliche \"game\" guys have played for years.  He pretended to do it and accidently doing that doesn't take away the harm.  \n\nIt's not playful to be dismissive, racially obtuse and ignore boundaries.", "Yeah it is.  A white woman with straight hair can get her hair wet without it reverting to a potentially kinky texture.  It might be ruined but it's not going to cost as much nor will she be affected by the social stigmas that would make someone like OP more worried about the appearance of their hair.", "He has been exposed to it. He has watched his girlfriend, someone he supposedly cares for and values, spend huge amounts of money, time and emotional investment on this; and has had it explicitly explained to him in words how he can and can\u2019t do things that may affect her hair.\n\nHis dismissal of all of that as not being serious/not being something he needs to pay attention to makes this the specific intersection of a racist dynamic and a sexist one that is often described as misogynoir - forms and manifestations of racism that disproportionately affect black women.", "Can we resist the urge to play devils advocate whenever a black woman deals with someone's racial insensitivity please?  He's not a new born, and he's been dating her for a while.  There's no excuse.  And he's not entitled to a pass just because he tried to make amends.", "To quote bo burnham \u201cwhy do these rich fucking white people insist on seeing every socio-political conflict through the myopic lens of their own self actualisation\u201d ik the context where he said this was not the same here, but it does apply. Lmao every non-american seems to think this isn\u2019t racist and every american does", "i understand that. but most of the people commenting are black, have experienced the same thing, or they\u2019re giving me genuine advice. saying that people think that my boyfriend wants to join the KKK, even if you were being sarcastic or whatever, isn\u2019t very helpful and it honestly weirded me out.", "It\u2019s only hair **too you!**\n\nYour mothers 4c hair is not your own.\n\nThe care attached means nothing to you, because you don\u2019t go through it lol\n\nInvalidating how she feels, over his actions is so weird.\n\n**Again, what could she have done to better communicate??** When she told him no water near her hair, and he simply didn\u2019t care. Because he intentionally started wrestling her while holding said water.\n\nThe care that you, or him, assign to hair very clearly, isn\u2019t the same that she, or even myself, assigns to it. \n\nThat isn\u2019t vain or wrong, it\u2019s about just different based on the time, work, and effort that goes into the styling that would make an action like this, so incredibly wrong.", "You are right. I misread. We agree.", "You don't fuck with ANY woman's hair.", ">The racism comes in when BF learned the rules for OP's hair and then dismissed them as unimportant, or a joking matter, or OP overreacting and taking her hair too seriously.\n\nDo you honestly think the boyfriend would've acted differently if OP were white?", "Some would argue teenagers are more or less walking organic unforeseen circumstances..", "[deleted]", "Sorry didn\u2019t mean to offend you here. Let me clarify one thing then I\u2019m popping off this issue.\nWhen I say soften, I mean I am reacting to the 30sec tussle. Your post made it seems like he held a glass over your head and you accidentally hit his hand shooing him away.\nBut if he was holding you down with one hand and this whole thing lasted for 30secs, he would have seen the look in your eyes and heard tone of your voice.  \nI know you guys are both young, so there seems to be a lot of learning here to be done.\nI wish you the best going forward\n\nEdit typo", "Its the definition of vain\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fcaring too much about apearance \n\nNot being able to have a loving playfight is definelty too much\n\nThat's the issue here. He's wrong for going too far, which he's shown he's sorry for by sending that absurd amount of money for just hair\n\nShe needs to chill", "So you didn't hear the gunshot because you... were in the... the shower...?\n\nYES.. I WAS IN THE SHOWER..", "r/Unexpectedlegallyblonde", "It\u2019s the girl Bible!", "**Ammonium thioglycolate**", "It's about intent vs impact. BF might well have approached a white woman with the same careless disregard for her boundaries, but the impact is greater because OP is black and black hair is an incredibly fraught topic. If he doesn't get that, he has no business dating a black woman.", "Yes, I do. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s because I am treated far differently when people see me, hear my first name, hear my married name, and assume I\u2019m white versus when they know I\u2019m Hispanic. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been treated with more respect in some hairstyles and hair colors than with my natural dark curls. Maybe it\u2019s because even my first boyfriend, who I started dating at 18, treated me differently when I acted white versus when I was eating my arroz con gandules and listening to music in Spanish, and that even his mom told me that once I got married I would \u201cforget all that. I mean, what \u201cculture\u201d did your people actually have, asses flapping in the wind? You should be grateful to the colonizers.\u201d Maybe because I was told life would be easier for me if I just tried to pass for white and ignored my roots. \n\nYeah, I totally believe this dude would have taken her more seriously if OP was white.", "Yes. Also, that's a pointless hypothetical; if she were white, there's a high chance that she wouldn't have such and intense and expensive hair care regimen. OP's emotional investment in her hair is directly connected to her Blackness.", "Yes. I\u2019m a white woman and I spent 5 years living with my three closest female friends, none of whom are white. Misogyny affects all women but whiteness insulates.", "If that\u2019s the case, then why did he even introduce the water into the scenario at all? \n\n**This isn\u2019t unforeseen, he went to retrieve the water, and this was a completely foreseen circumstance of his actions. Otherwise, what was the point of him doing this in the first place?**\n\nIf not to put the water on her then what was his intent?\n\nIt could just be a simple as he didn\u2019t respect her boundary because he didn\u2019t want to and now he feels bad instead of honoring her wishes to begin with. \n\nIn what other way can she express her boundaries for him to honor them other than how she did before this interaction even occurred?", "i\u2019m sorry, i\u2019m extremely confused and concerned. i\u2019m not sure what \u201cbiases\u201d i\u2019m showing here but i can assure you, i have none. i\u2019m sorry if you think that i\u2019m too immature to date people outside of my race. i\u2019m not sure what you want me to say to that. i also know that i have no way to confirm if someone is black or not behind a screen, but that doesn\u2019t matter. if it\u2019s good advice, it\u2019s good advice.", "you didn\u2019t offend me. thank you for clarifying.", "How is disregarding what she asked him not to do playful? He could\u2019ve wrestled her without the water. I\u2019m sure there wouldn\u2019t even be a post if that was the case.\n\nSo again, what could she have done to better communicate with him that she did not want water in her hair? A request which he completely disregarded."]}
