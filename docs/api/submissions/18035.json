The CashApp is a good start.\n\nI hope you\u2019re okay. Being disrespected like that by someone you\u2019re supposed to be able to trust hurts, no matter what it\u2019s about.", "NTA - Hes a huge AH for this and this was very immature.", "NTA. You told him repeatedly not to do this. He did it anyway and completely dismissed your feelings about it. Of course he feels bad about it now, and it's good that he's paying you back, but the money isn't the issue. The issue is him ignoring your request and thinking that acting this way is funny. He needs to get it through his head that this isn't ok.", "NTA. You told him it was serious to you and that\u2019s all he needed to know to not do that. I\u2019m a black woman as well so I completely understand your reaction and your anger. I do think it\u2019s worth explaining to him in detail when you\u2019re less upset and hope he\u2019ll understand the importance from now on.

I would be incredibly pissed if I specifically asked someone to respect a certain boundary and they thought it was funny to violate it.\n\nIs it common for him to tease you about being a perfectionist? And if so, do you typically laugh along with him? If that's the case, I'd give him a little grace in that he figured this was another thing where you are perhaps over the top. It is also good he sent you money; it sounds like he has done some reflecting and realized he fucked up.\n\nBut if he is frequently giving you crap about being a perfectionist and you aren't laughing along with him, then he's probably too immature to respect your needs/boundaries. And by sending you money he probably thinks he \"fixed\" the issue.", "NTA- oh my god. \n\nI would tell your boyfriend that you cannot move forward with this relationship until he educates himself about black hair. That what he did was extremely disrespectful. And it is not a big deal to him because he doesn\u2019t understand the work, money and time that goes into it. So until he educates himself and apologizes from a place of actually understanding why this was a big deal- you have a problem. \n\nAlso-\nReagan Elizabeth Jackson wrote a great poem about her hair called \u201cNot your Afro-American Petting Zoo\u201d you might like reading that right about now.", "NTA, YOU DID NOT OVERREACT!!! Listen boyfriend or not apart of my culture or not if I tell you don't touch my hair and don't do it. It's the audacity of him to think that just cause he don't think it's a big deal it's not.  If you are really considering staying in the relationship make him go to the salon with you and sit there the entire time you get your hair done, and don't let him sleep.  In fact scratch his head and then give him a perm. He will understand don't touch a Black Woman's crown!", "NTA - That was a really crappy thing to do.  It's fair to be angry.  It's also cool that he sent you money to get it redone.  He sounds remorseful.  Being angry was fair, but so is forgiveness if you're up to it.", " NTA. Don\u2019t let someone gaslight you! That was cruel and toxic. It is NOT FUNNY! Your feelings matter. Again sis, YOUR FEELINGS MATTER. That was very inconsiderate to say the least.

And now you know, determine how people feel about you by how they treat your hair, how ever it decides to shapeshift.", "NTA\n\nHe wouldn't respect a very basic and reasonable boundary you had, you just wanted him to leave your hair alone. I worry about his possible lack of respect of other, more important boundaries you may have. He could be remorseful in a genuine way by sending you money to get it redone, and hopefully he apologizes in a sincere way, but something's off about why he didn't respect your wishes in the first place.", "Nta and I would use the money he sent to get it redone. I would reach out to him and thank him for the money to get it redone because the fact he sent u that money means that he realizes now that it is a big deal and won't do it in the future. I would forgive him and talk about it out with him. I'm sure he's really sorry and really didn't think it was that big of a deal and he learned a big lesson in the relationship.

Never, ever, in the 11 years we\u2019ve been together, has he *ever* even joked about disrespecting me like that. Anyone saying that he didn\u2019t understand - it doesn\u2019t take first hand knowledge, especially when you told him repeatedly. It has nothing to do with his race, and everything to do with his lack of respect for you. \n\nIf he is genuinely contrite, can identify what he did wrong and why it was wrong, and promises to never do it again, I would consider giving him a second chance.

He didn\u2019t care. And people can only treat you as you allow them.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry girl, because appointments (and good dudes) can be difficult to get sometimes.", "NTA.  It's a dick move to KNOWINGLY do that, especially to someone who you've known for a while and would KNOW they don't want that.", "Nta.  I don't care that much about my hair so I don't fully get it.  But if I was dating you, I wouldn't need to.

You set a boundary and he chose to ignore it. It was an expensive service, and so at least he gave you the money to get it again, but that doesn't fix the problem. \n\nIt doesn't matter if something isn't important or serious to him, he should've respected you regardless. \n\nYou haven't overreacted at all, and based on him saying \"didn't think it was a big deal\" while you're freaking out, makes me think that he doesn't regret his actions at all. \n\nNTA.", "Nta you specifically told him what not to do. You only asked that he respect you, and he decided to act like a literal bully child who's mad you paid attention to yourself.", "NTA you're totally not overreacting. He completely disrespected everything you said to him.\n\nHe legitimately needs to educate himself on the process of taking care of and styling hair like yours. I'm super white, but have started watching the process of black people taking care of and styling their hair.... and Holy shit dude the process of just regular daily care can be a lot of work by itself. \n\nBut the process/work and *fuckin cost* of styling black hair is insane. That shit is impressive for a reason, and takes unbelievable amounts of time, money, and attention to detail. Your bf needs educated BIG TIME cause he does not at all understand the entirety of black hair care.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a high school teacher, and if I had nickel for every time something like this happened to one of my students\u2026well, I\u2019d probably be able to afford a better vacation this summer. Anyway, it seems like he was just teasing you, but it is more than ok to get mad and cry when that happened.\n\nIt\u2019s nice that he sent you money to get your hair re-done, but you need to actually talk to him about this. I, admittedly, know absolutely nothing about women\u2019s hair care, but I know (and try to teach male students) how much women can care about their hair. When something like this is close to happening in my classroom, I ask the guy if he\u2019d like it if I scuffed up his new Jordans. When he says no, I tell him that to the girl he was teasing that her hair was just like his Jordans (even though she also probably had them), and that usually got them to understand. Maybe something like that can better help your boyfriend understand why even teasing you like that isn\u2019t right.", "NTA... but if he is truly repentant of his ignorance, it might be time to forgive. I take it he sent you the money without being asked?", "NTA. To me it's similar to depriving you of your bodily autonomy. Today it's your hair, what's next? Hiding your favorite outfit/ jeans so you can't wear them out of the house because you look too good in them? Poke holes in your diaphragm or his rubbers because he wants to knock you up? That's a deal breaker for me.", "NTA\n\nAnd paying for a new blow out is only step one. \n\nStep two is he has to spend the time you are sitting at the stylist doing NOTHING (no games, books, phone etc) because you\u2019re stuck doing nothing. \n\nStep three is to make up for the disrespect and waste of your time for having to spend more time getting your hair done a second time by planning a relaxing (or fun, your choice) afternoon for you. \n\nThis way he will understand the cost involved, the time involved, and hopefully the relaxing or fun afternoon will allow for reconnecting and will help him never cross boundaries again.", "Well, you're both pretty young and he was being totally stupid. Your reaction was a bit over the top. Good for him for sending money right away. Don't throw away a great relationship over a minute of stupidity. NTA for getting angry and upset, but hopefully he's learned you are serious about your hair and you can forgive him.", "NTA \n\n<<<he seemed to really like my hair, and i gave him the usual run down of what he can and cannot do around it, but i put a lot more emphasis on not playing in it and>>>\n\nUsual?  Did he not get the message the first time?  No, clearly not.  \n\nThat was out right malicious.   It wasn't funny in the least.", "NTA - this was a hate crime. \ud83d\ude02 i appreciate that he sent money to have it fixed however, if he truly cares about you he should respect your boundaries always.", "NTA. If he had accidentally spilled water when reaching for it or something I wouldn\u2019t say this is a breakup-able offense.. but he was deliberate. He doesn\u2019t take it seriously which means he doesn\u2019t take YOU seriously. No one messes with my hair when I blow it out and I don\u2019t get it professionally done, nor is my hair as curly.

(editing... /s.  totally /s.)", "Not really.  She told him not to do something to her person.  He disregarded her body autonomy and do it anyway.  He doesn\u2019t deserve a pass.  \n\nOP can forgive him, but he\u2019s still an asshole.", "She told him very specifically. He thought it was ok to ignore what she said. Just because he sent money because he's afraid OP will walk doesn't mean he understands that he violated her bodily autonomy. OP still needs to determine that.", "So first off, NTA. He fucked up. That said, I think people here are being very OTT. He absolutely shouldn't have done what he did, but I think it's really important to note he's apologised and seemingly cashapped you thr money to correct his mistake - did he do that unasked, or at least immediately upon being asked?\n\nI don't love what he did, but the capacity to learn is an important one and if he's truly sorry - by which I mean recognises his fault, has taken steps to correct the problem and isn't going to do it again, I think that's worth something. But it can only happen the one time. He can't give you the faux heartfelt apology, pay his way out the the problem and then repeat the behaviour over and over again.", "Wrestling you?  How long did this last? \ud83d\udea9", "He's 18. Teenagers are dumb and need to learn, and it sounds like he actually learned. I'm not a huge fan of 'he's just a kid and deserves a second chance,' because so often it's applied to kids who are protected from learning and have done nothing to deserve a second a chance. But in this case, he recognized he fucked up, he made amends unprompted, and that suggests to me that he does, in fact, deserve a second chance, because  he is capable of learning and has shown that he has learned.", "He\u2019s young and immature.  Hopefully, he leaned a valuable lesson.", ">I think people here are being very OTT\n\nWhen did you first realise you were on AITA?", "He ruined a $120 hair treatment, and soaked her clothes with water.  I wouldn\u2019t say that was without harm.  Quite the opposite \n\nEspecially since he ignored all of her boundaries about this situation to push forward for his \u201cjoke\u201d.  There\u2019s some trust destroying harm for you there too.   \n\nAre there worse things that can happen?  Absolutely \n\nWas this avoidable ? \nAbsolutely \n\nWere her described actions in line with protecting herself? \nSure as hell sounds like they were to me \n\nIs the guy young and stupid? \nAbsolutely \n\nCan he learn from this?\nJury is still out \n\nDoes she bear part of the blame ?\nNope", "Recognizing you\u2019ve fucked up isn\u2019t automatically equal to sending money. For me personally, it requires a verbal acknowledgment of the fuck up, why and an apology with action that backs it up. Otherwise it\u2019s just \u201coops\u201d money and he\u2019ll think he can keep pushing her boundaries and fix it with money or gifts.", "That makes it worse.", "True, true!", "Agreed, but OP says he's tried to contact her multiple times, so he might indeed be wanting to just that. She is the one not talking to him right now.\n\nThis isn't me judging her for that. I fully get where she's coming from and I'm not going to universally advice her to get back with him or even just talk to him, because this was a major violation and women tend to give cis dudes way too many chances. She might be right and all of this is just him trying to save face, she knows him better than we do. But hin sending the money might be a step in a right direction, he might realize that he fucked up majorly and is trying to handle the situation in the best way an 18yo with little to no relationship experience could, which is to say he's going to be fumbling through this because he is 18.\n\n\nI honestly do not know what to tell her about the relationship except that she is very much NTA in this situation and it is certainly territory worth breaking up over, and if she tells him she never wants to see him again but keeps the money she would also still be NTA is this.", "NTA.  If you want to just be done with him, that's fair. If you want to see if there's anything left though you're going to actually have to talk to him.  Give him a chance to apologize and see what he apologizes for. Is he just sorry that it went sideways and he ruined your hair? Or does he recognize how disrespectful he was to be so dismissive and to play around trying to stress you out?  I'd listen to what he says and then take a little time to decide what to do.  I'd be real interested in hearing what he thought would happen?  How does he think this would have been a proper way to treat his girlfriend even if the water wouldn't have spilled?  How did he think this was going to go?  If he says anything along the lines of \"not a big deal\" or \"not that serious\" at any point during the conversation, I'd be done with him but maybe that's just me.", "INFO: sounds like he didn't actually intend on pouring that on you. Did he?", "ESH\n\nHe ignored your boundaries and did something he knew you weren\u2019t comfortable with and is now trying to win you back, he\u2019s not worth it \n\nBut at the same time it\u2019s just water, you can get your hair done again anytime", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it wass a one time lack of judgement, you might consider forgivimg him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf he does things like that more often, end the relationship.", "NTA but maybe he's just not educated on it, especially if he's white (saying this as a non black poc idk black hair styles either :') lol). if he really cares he'd take the time to listen and learn about your hair so this doesn't happen again in the future. It's not over the top to feel hurt by this, and it may be something that affects the trust in your relationship, but you two can only get through it if there's an active effort to understand each other on both ends. if you feel like nothing has changed after this then maybe it's time to reevaluate staying, however him sending you the money shows he realized what he did was wrong. I hope you two can resolve this peacefully <3", "NTA Dump him. You set an easy and clear boundary for him to follow. He immediately started testing that boundary. He immediately thought he knew better than you and your hairdressers about your hair. Although you hit his wrist, he was absolutely intending to spill water on you as evidenced by \"a little water won't fuck it up\". It was clearly a big deal to you or you wouldn't have spent so much time telling him  the rules around what he could and could not do with your hair.\n\nHe doesn't get to decide what does and doesn't matter to you. If you didn't want him to touch you whether with his body or with another substance, he didn't have the right to overrule you on that. If you stay with him, he's going to push your boundaries more and more. Do not let him make you think that you're not entitled to set a boundary. He is not respectful or kind. Why would you want to risk something that clearly makes your partner feel good about themselves to make a point?", "NTA But I think there's a genuine chance that he doesn't know HOW MUCH work went into your hair. I'd be tempted to make him come with you to your next appointment and sit there while it's being done. Obviously he should have just believed you in the first place, and he's an ass for 'messing with you'.", "NTA. Since he payed for your hair to be redone, I'd like to assume he realized he was wrong, and also had no intention to actually poor water on you, it was meant as \"a joke\" and not actually be harmful. Hopefully he apologizes properly and you guys can continue to be happy together, assuming this isn't a pattern of his. Good luck on getting your hair redone.", "NTA,\n\ni\u2019m black and i do my hair every 3-4 weeks and honestly i wouldn\u2019t forgive him for it. I would think it\u2019s break up worthy. Bc now that you\u2019ve gotten ur blow out and it\u2019s gotten wet like a couple days later you\u2019re going to have to wash and condition ur hair again and then get a blow out which means double heat only within a small space of time which can lead to heat damage. You told him no emphatically and he disregarded that. Can you really trust that when you say no with other things regarding your person that he will listen?", "NTA and this boy doesn\u2019t respect you. I refuse to call him a man because no man would treat a woman he cares about like this.", "NTA, I would\u2019ve dumped him.", "Your ruined hair isn't actually the problem, it's his attitude to something you were proud of. He was delighted and entertained by:\n\n* threatening your body\n* ruining some status change / achievement that you were proud of\n* ruining something you treated yourself to\n\nAnd when confronted, he told you that it wasn't a big deal, when anyone with eyes and ears could tell that it really fucking mattered to you.\n\nI've described the situation in really generic terms because I want you to honestly review your relationship with him and ask if you have had other issues with him that fit the description above. If you have, the problem isn't your blowout. It's his need to take you down a peg if he thinks you're getting too successful/pretty/financially independent.\n\nHe needs you to feel small and less than.

We were all jumping off a dock into a canal, girl (black) showed up in swimsuit and freshly done hair, she came all \"I just got my hair done haha\". Guy (white, not sure if he heard her) pushed her in, because why, we are all jumping and pushing each other in- the girl FREAKED. He apologised, went to her house and apologised to her mum, and offered to pay for it. He gained a lot of respect for owning up to it even though the rest of us thought she was crazy for even being *near* the water.\n\nNTA, give him the chance to apologize and make it up to you and move on if you can.

This is an opportunity to learn how to resolve  conflict in your relationship. I would find that kind of teasing immature and disrespectful and I'd tell him if it happens again it's over. I think this is the kind of thing fixed by communication and changed behaviour going forward. He needs to learn that respecting your clearly stated boundaries is more important than teasing you about said boundaries.", "ESH... So in the comments and slightly alluded to in the post, he was teasing you then both of you were play fighting which caused the spill. \n\nYes he is the bigger AH, but it takes two to tango. You should not have engaged with his antics and told him that you were not going to entertain his childishness. He should have known from the past that you are serious about your hair and that its not something that he should tease you about.  \n\nIt was immature and childish of him to tease you. He has tried to apologise and offered to pay to have his mistake corrected. No, you don't have to forgive him but he is trying to make things right by you. \n\nIf we are going by the title, N T A for being upset in the moment. Make a decision if you think you two are compatible, accept his apology, decide if you want to forgive him, break up or move on accordingly.", "Lots of blokes don't take hair seriously. \n\nThe whole 5:1 bodywash shampoo conditioner mayonnaise ketchup joke.\n\nHe probably thought she was being over serious.\n\nHe's still an AH but he seems genuinely apologetic, has apologised, sent her the money to get it fixed. Etc etc.\n\nBeing an AH isn't a crime, repeatedly being one and refusing to change is. \n\nAlso I'll note. He's white. Our hair doesn't have the same issues as black hair.
