They are very different people.  BIL was always social, an athlete, and liked to party.  He's now a police officer.  My husband was an introvert, scholarly, and liked to read.  He served in the Army and is now a lawyer.  They didn't socialize much as kids, because they didn't have a lot in common, but my husband considered their relationship to be good.\n\nBoth brothers married about 11 years ago, within a few months of each other.  The four of us got along well at first, despite having different interests, and I hoped we'd have a friendly in-law relationship.  However, the relationship has steadily deteriorated over time.  There has never been an overt fight, but at this stage neither couple is interested in being in a room with the other.  \n\nFrom our perspective, BIL and SIL just don't seem to like us (which is confusing but is their right), and this plays out in exclusionary ways (which isn't ok).  Examples:\n\n* They ask us when we will be available for family Christmas Eve dinner, and then deliberately host the event for a time we said we'd still be at work\n* They invite the immediate family to a dinner for their child's birthday, but then serve only pizza and cake, despite knowing that I'm gluten-intolerant.\n\nWe're currently at an inflection point, because the animosity between the two brothers is now causing tensions between my husband and his parents, which may ultimately result in a no-contact decision.  I'm reflecting on what brought us here.  I know that there political and socioeconomic differences between our two families that have caused tensions, but on a personal level I know we've tried to be kind and helpful family members.  However, I keep thinking about one event early on in our marriage(s) in which I might have been the asshole, and wondering/worrying if that was the turning point that starting building their animosity towards us.\n\nFor my BIL's first birthday after their wedding, my SIL planned a large surprise birthday for him, to be held on the day of his birthday.  She invited their friends, her family, and our entire extended family, including my husband and I.  She did not acknowledge that it was also my husband's birthday.  On a personal level, I thought this was incredibly rude.  My husband felt unenthusiastic and weird about spending his birthday at a party that was only to celebrate his twin's birthday.  I wanted my husband to be able to feel special on his birthday, so we politely declined the invitation and went out to a nice dinner, just the two of us.  This felt reasonable to me, but I also feel like the tension between the two couples began growing after that event, ultimately leading us to where we are today.

Most folks don't really understand how incredibly difficult it is to navigate different friends, different preferences, different temperments, gifts from guests for BOTH??? ugh.... and I really dreaded my birthday because of it.  :(   \n\nanyways, it's unreasonable for SIL to expect ya'll to want to spend your husband's birthday at an event that doesn't even acknowledge that it's both birthday celebrations (especially if there were shared friends and family).  \n\nYour husband is allowed to do birthdays with or without his twin as is your twin, so it was nice for you to get an invite, but not unreasonable for you not to go.  I think you did the superbly graceful thing here by bowing out and giving your husband a lovely birthday outing, and the SIL should try to understand that.  \n\nMy solution to this was to move very far away and now, birthdays are fun again.", "NTA, they didn't want to celebrate your husbands birthday. You two wanted to and should do. You did the right thing. Honestly no contact seems good, his family doesn't respect him.", "NTA.\n\nI can relate to how your husband must have felt in that \"non-celebration\" for him. I shared my birthday with my grandmother, and i didn't like it when people had to be reminded every year that it was my birthday too. As an adult your husband had every right to decide how to celebrate his birthday even if it was away from family.\n\nIf you're feeling anxious of reaching the no-contact point with your husband's family, you can try reaching out as a last-ditch effort to salvage the relationship, but start small. At least you tried.", "NTA. That's just bizarre to be invited to a birthday party exclusively for your husband's twin. How the heck did your BIL and SIL expect you and your husband to feel?", "No. NTA to not go to a birthday party for a twin without the other twin being celebrated.  She could have reached out to you and made this a joint party.  Alas.  Even your husband didn't want to go.  To your SIL, your husband is spare parts for her husband.  Nothing more.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  I don't understand how the family can celebrate one twin's birthday without at least a discussion of why the other twin's birthday is to celebrated.  I mean if your husband doesn't celebrate his birthday, that's one thing.  But to host and organize party where almost all the attendees know that there is another celebrant is inconsiderate and rude.", "NTA - SIL started this by having a surprise birthday party for only one twin, expecting the twin brother to pretend it\u2019s not his birthday too.  This isn\u2019t just about twins.. in my family and my husband\u2019s family, we have clustered birthdays.  It would be rude to have a birthday party on the same day as a relative\u2019s birthday and not celebrate them too.  It sounds like SIL expected your husband to act like he doesn\u2019t have a twin, he has a brother and it\u2019s not his birthday too\u2026 MIL and FIL should have explained to her, that that is rude and she needs to accommodate or include this as a twins thing.  They didn\u2019t. So, yes, you irked them by not showing up but SIL caused that problem.  As for the gluten thing, I was raised to ask guest and understand guest\u2019s allergies, preferences, etc because if I am hosting I should have foods to accommodate them.  It\u2019s one thing to not know, but it\u2019s quite another to know and not care.\n\nYour BIL and SIL are self centered and vindictive.  They do what they want and they don\u2019t care how that affects family.  It is vindictive to ask what time you are available for a Christmas Eve family dinner and then set the time so that you cannot attend.  I hosted Christmas Eve for years (we actually would have dinner out), but I would contact everyone who wanted to come and would set the time to fit everyone\u2019s schedule. I would never pick a time with close family couldn\u2019t attend because that would be rude and callous.  Why did they bother asking when you were free unless they really wanted to know when you weren\u2019t free\u2026 I have spent a couple of hours each year figuring out with family what day and time worked for everyone.  But that\u2019s what you do when you want to be caring and inclusive.\n\nWe are all different\u2026 some are extroverts and some are introverts.  Being an extrovert is not an excuse to be rude, vindictive, or unkind.\n\nYou and your husband are adults, and as adults, you get to decide who you want to associate with or not.  I would suggest you create your own traditions and do you own thing rather than being constantly dissed by the ILs.", "NTA.  Sounds reasonable.  Stop bothering with these people.  Relatives you are stuck with, family you choose.", "If they are choosing to create permanent tension over declining one event then you\u2019re NTA.\n\nHowever, you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case here. It sounds like a natural build up of people with different personalities and expectations.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to say how much, if at all, your examples of them were vindictive. Maybe the time you were at work worked best for everyone overall. Maybe they were so focused on serving their child\u2019s favorites that they were a bit thoughtless.\n\nEven when it comes to your husband\u2019s birthday there\u2019s space for nuance. Your husband is an introvert. Would he really want to be the center of a huge party? If I were his brother\u2019s family I might think your husband would prefer if we didn\u2019t highlight him at all, pespecially if your husband didn\u2019t know everyone there or the party was relatively big.\n\nThe obvious solution to this was of course for someone in the family to talk to your husband. However, I get the sense the family doesn\u2019t communicate well.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t feel too guilty here. It sounds like a mutual decision. However, if this separation is bothering your husband it\u2019s okay for him to try and build bridges.", "NTA\n\nAs someone whose birthday always seemed to be overshadowed by another family members engagement, wedding, baby shower, anniversary, etc. I feel the pain of being forced to suck it up and pretend to be happy being dragged to a location not of my choosing to celebrate someone else\u2019s big moment. That we can celebrate me at a more convenient time because this is a special moment for someone else. \n\nYou are definitely NTA for celebrating your husbands birthday instead of his twin brothers birthday. It should be obvious to everyone involved why you would want to do so, but sadly I know firsthand that some people are too self centered to see past themselves.", "NTA it seems to me his brother doesn't like nor want him in his life. So going NC seems like the right idea. Your husband doesn't need that crap om his life. I mean they are twins and she pretended otherwise.so yeah let them have your IN-LAWS and everyone else. Good Luck", "NAH but if there is any A-holery, you're included in it. Your SIL should not be expected to throw a party for your husband even if he was born on the same day as her's. She's not their mommy. And how do you know she wouldn't have acknowledged your husband? You didn't show up.", "Without knowing more about the political differences at the heart of the \"tensions\" between your families, I don't think there is enough information here for a judgment. \n\nYour sister-in-law going to the trouble of putting together a big surprise party for her husband but not making it a joint party is strange, but only because your husband was born on the same day. It doesn't sound like you proposed making it a shared celebration or volunteered to do any of the work, you just expected that she would center your husband without any input from you two. Did you talk to them at any point about how you and your husband felt, or did you just decline the invitation without any explanation?", "I'm gonna say NTA if you both received the invitation for bith of you stating is wasa surprise party for your BIL.  If you received the invite, just you, no mention of your husband, than YTA because that would tell me it was a surprise for both of them.\n\nI do have to ask, did SIL make you, just you aware of the party prior to the invitations being sent out, or even to discuss the idea of the party beforehand?  If she did either of those than you dropped the ball because that would tell me that she was trying to indicate she wanted you to add your invites, and contribution to the party for your husband to be part of the celebration, but she sucks at communication.\n\nWhat I'm also curious about is how the family felt about the exclusion of your husband?", "If neither of you wanted to attend the party, that's fine.\n\nNTA", "BIL is a cop. Nuff said. NTA", "NTA. The birthday thing and the deliberately scheduling during times when you are unavailable is a dick move. Probably best just to give back the energy they put in unless it\u2019s just toxic - then cut and run.", ">large surprise birthday\n\nUhhh.. is it at all possible that your husband was going to be included as a surprise? And that your SIL was just trying to, you know, keep it a surprise..? I mean, just from this story, I feel like she dropped enough hints to kind of say \"hey wink wink I'm throwing a surprise party. Tell hubby that it's just for his brother lol it's gonna be great\", and you just said \"fuck off we're going to dinner by ourselves\"\n\nNTA though, just seems like a miscommunication", "YTA-  its not up to SIL to hold a party for your husband. thats your job.  You could have easily gone, stay an hour and then gone do your own thing.\n\nPlus whatever relationship the twins have, is on them not you, not the parents and not SIL. If they want to talk, they will, if they dont well they don't. That isnt your job.", "Y-T-A for expecting them to fix foods especially for you at a kid\u2019s birthday party.  Eat before you go the same way us vegetarians do when we know there won\u2019t be much or anything we can eat.  Who expects more than pizza and cake at a kids\u2019 party.  YTA since it was you who refused to attend BILs party.  That should have been 100% your husband\u2019s decision.  I smell that an entitled, demanding, self-centered wife\u2019s behavior has caused this divide and I\u2019m not talking about your BIL\u2019s wife.", "YTA for declining the birthday invite. From the info provided, you didn't try and suggest to your SIL that you chip in and both of you co-host the party for the twins.\n\nNext, I don't believe in acting like an AH just because someone else is behaving like one. Yes, your SIL overlooked the fact that her hubby has a twin. But by being the only ones not present at the party, you both made yourselves look bad.\n\nWould it have been so bad to show up for while at least?\n\nAs for your overall contribution to the deterioration of the relationship, I think it's limited. Your BIL and SIL seem envious of you both and your financial means. If your political values don't align, it makes it that much more fractious.\n\nI would choose to deal with this relationship with grace and the maximum benefit of doubt. Not let others' pettiness get to me and anchor myself in my own conduct, not the conduct of others.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If it is, that would be really petty on your SIL / BIL side. It's kind of tempting to start to speculate on a big reason for the erosion of their relationship, but it's very possible it's just an accumulation of little reasons.  \n\nEven though speculation can be fun especially here on reddit. It sounds like if you really want to stop their relationship eroding any further, guessing time is over and open and honest conversation time is needed. \n\nMaybe without the spouses at first. Maybe brother and brother can enjoy some shared interest together and figure out what is holding their relationship back and what they want their relationship to look like going forward.", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say INFO. Please hear me out, OP.\n\nI'm a twin too - my sister and I have always been very close. We also have really different lives. While we've tried to share moments equally, it's just reality that sometimes one of us has the spotlight, and that's okay. We've had combined birthday parties, as well as parties that were planned for me by my friends that she came to (and then naturally, we were both kinda celebrated, were both sung to, etc.)\n\nThat dynamic feels equal while also allowing us to have our own identities, and it is also something I could imagine is hard to understand if you're not a twin. I don't think your in-laws were wrong to want a party for just your BIL. You also don't know what they would have done for your husband had you been there. Your husband might have been more included in the fun than you both thought he would be.\n\nI also don't think that's the reason they're distant. You don't have nearly enough information. I would suggest opening up a conversation and asking if anything went wrong between you all and how to improve things, and let them know how you feel too. You'll be shocked at how much that gesture would mean to them. The situation doesn't seem insidious and *definitely* doesn't justify going no contact. It's just an icy few years that can happen between adults.\n\nFamily (and twin) relationships are everything if you're lucky to have them, and they take work and vulnerability. I wish you all the best of luck!", "You did the right thing.  Her SIL deliberately excluded her husband (it was cruel).  I am in a similar situation and I know what it feels like to be scorned on your birthday.  My birthday is the same day as my grandfather and great-grandmother: August 20.  So my birthday is not celebrated.  They throw a big party for my grandfather and they don't congratulate me at all.  I once heard my aunt say that I was not her daughter and that she did not have to give me a cake or a party.  My parents are divorced and absent.  Feeling like an intruder on your own birthday is not pretty.  You have not done anything, you have shown that you will not tolerate their slights and rudeness.

The invitation was just weird. OP owed no explanation as to why they would not go.", "No, both my husband and I received a facebook invite to the party at the same time, after it had been fully planned.  She did not reach out to me in advance at all.

Why would they be somehow required to show up and acknowledge that event, given the completely lack of reciprocal recognition?\n\nI'd get your response if they kicked up some kind of dramatic fuss and made a big deal about not attending, but they didn't do that.

But, since you don't really know, it's just an assumption.\n\nMy suggestion would be for your husband to reach out to his brother and have a 1:1 conversation (no spouses) with him to try to get to the bottom of what's going on.  Hopefully whatever happened is just a misunderstanding that got blown way out of proportion, and can be worked through.  If it did have something to do with the birthday, then it's your husband's opportunity to tell his brother that it would have been appreciated if SIL had asked if they wanted to make it a joint party, but as it was, it just sent the wrong message.  \n\nAnd after that, if the two brothers can't get on the same page, then you can choose to go NC.\n\nGood luck!", "Then NTA.

Your SIL is allowed to have a great surprise party for her husband without also making it for his twin, who may not even know or care to socialize with his brother's friends.

Like surprise we told you it was just for your brother but it's really for both of you and they got offended you didn't magically work that out. \n\nOP, you are in the clear because your husband didn't want to go to the party so there's not really anything you can do in that situation other than force him to go which is a solid no so you going to dinner with him was nice. As for your husband, I think NTA because even if it was a sort of surprise party, you don't have to attend those if you're not comfortable. \n\nI think your husband needs to speak with his brother if he wants a relationship going forward.

Yet, if he had a birthday party that my whole family was invited to, one of two things would happen\u2026 we would celebrate his birthday and my birthday on two different dates with all the same family but both of us would be acknowledged on both days, one day would just focus on what the one twin wanted to do and the other day would focus on what the other would want to do, or we would celebrate it together as one big family", "I don't see anything wrong here with the party.

We offer a Celiac friendly option when we host (obviously), but it's definitely the norm for people with celiac to have to bring their own food to events. Yes, even with family, especially at an event for a lot of people like a birthday party. Maybe a third of our family can accommodate Celiac, and that's fine. I communicate with the host, figure out if there will be anything safe, and pack similar looking safe foods for my daughter.", "Yeah, the second example is an awful big stretch for me.  It's a child's birthday party, pizza and cake is typical.  This is coming from someone who has a restricted diet, I don't expect people who accommodate my diet.  I greatly appreciate when they do!  But I don't expect it, especially at a kid's party of all things.", "This may be a cultural thing, but if I threw a gathering, especially one for my family, I'd make sure that there's food and drink to accommodate everyone. I want everyone to have a good time and to feel welcome. My uncle and grandma don't eat pork, so there has to be beef hot dogs our cookouts. My mom doesn't eat chicken, so we make sure to have an alternative for her. We make sure there's sweet tea and orange soda for various drink preferences. If we have a vegan guest, we usually go store bought instead of homemade bc we are very Southern and not accustomed to cooking vegetables without some sort of butter or pork. Hell, when my auntie quit drinking, we made sure to have a dry Thanksgiving and Christmas to accommodate her.\n\nLong story short: I think you and your wife aren't asking for enough. It's not a lot of effort to make your guests feel welcome. If you plan an event, you should want everyone to have a good time.\n\nUnless ya'll just don't trust everyone's cooking or ability to prevent cross contamination, bc I totally fucking get that.", "> This may be a cultural thing, but if I threw a gathering, especially one for my family, I'd make sure that there's food and drink to accommodate everyone. \n\nI don't even feel like that's cultural.

If you have a food restriction, you have to learn that not having something for you is not an insult.", "NTA. I\u2019d say the tension was already there if your SIL decided to ignore that her husband\u2019s TWIN BROTHER had the same birthday and should have been included in the party. It was incredibly mean-spirited to exclude him from the celebration on his own birthday. As soon as you put your foot down and stood up for yourselves, the antagonism seems to have gotten worse. It sounds like things are irreparable, and do you honestly want to have a relationship with people that are so petty and unpleasant?", "NTA.  \nHonestly it seems a little weird that his parents would support that. It's both their birthdays.  \nNow, hosting a party with his friends and SiL's family for him, that's not unreasonable; but to invite the whole family and exclude him? That's sketchy. \nSounds like your husband's twin feels like he's in your brother's shadow now, and doesn't really know how to handle it.   \nBeing the jock that parties makes you cool in high school, and being a cop is fine; but your husband shows a lot more character by joining the military and a lot more dedication by becoming a lawyer. Plus I'm sure he makes more as a lawyer than his brother as a cop.", "Not going to judge the distant past, but I can imagine this split being in the cards since childhood. Sorry you have to live through it---not your fault.", "I actually have a twin party situation happening now.  My boy/girl twins are about to turn 16.  Last year I asked them about a party (we don't do it every year), and my son wanted one, but my daughter didn't.  She did say she'd like one for her 16th, though.\n\nSo last year, we had the party for my son, my daughter was there, everyone knew it was her birthday too because the guests were school friends who also knew they were twins, but we didn't really say much about it.  It was mentioned, there were probably a few jokes amongst all the banter, but it was definitely a party for my son, not both.\n\nThis year is a little different.  When we made the arrangements last year, we talked about my son having a birthday party last year, and my daughter would have one this year.  But things have changed socially, and many of the friends my daughter would invite actually started off as my son's friends.  It would be ridiculous to have a party officially just for my daughter, when everyone knows it's also my son's birthday, and most people there are also very good friends of his.  It felt different last year, because although my daughter was friendly enough with the guests, most weren't within her own social group.\n\nI was trying to figure out how to be fair and just keep it as her party, but we decided it couldn't be done.  In the end, it worked out because my daughter is an introvert, and was a bit uncomfortable with all attention being on her anyway, so she asked if we could make it an official joint party, so the limelight could be shared.  Problem solved.\n\nI think that given your birthday twins are adults, and live very different lives, it was fine to have a party just for one of them, especially thrown by his own wife.  Why would you expect her to do all the work, but the party be for both of them?  Having said that, at a minimum, your husband's birthday should be acknowledged and congratulated somewhere in the proceedings, even if it isn't a big focus.\n\nOn the other hand, if they are this upset because you didn't turn up to a party, all these years later .. that's just ridiculous.", "None of these feel that passive aggressive to me, so it's a 50/50 on whether you're just making assumptions or not, you might want to get the two to actually talk to each other. Either way, you didn't have to go to his brother's birthday party if you didn't want to, so NTA for that.", "Well said.  SIL and BIL show passive-aggressive behaviors (dinners, this overtly exclusionary party they wanted OP and Husband to witness.)  If there were a just cause for the behavior, OP can bank on their raising it before now. \n\nThey probably are jealous of OP and husband's financial stability, and their comfort born of self- confidence, making them happy NOT being the center of attention. \n\nYWNBTA to simply accept this as The Way Things Are, and allow the schism to grow; maturity cannot be forced on another, not on BIL and SIL, not on MIL and FIL.  Any attempts on OP and husband's parts are likely to fuel the fire further rather than bank the logs.\n\nConsider building a family-of-choice, starting with members of OP's relatives, perhaps select individuals husband's, and friends.  Time may improve this, or not, but this way OP and husband will have the benefits of family on their own terms.  Good luck!", "Always good to hear from the SIL herself. Thanks for speaking up!", "Speak for yourself. My friends and I make sure we have a GF alternative for any party we host. You never know in general who might be GF, but jeez, if a close family member is GF, and you don't have something for them, you're sending a clear message of contempt.", "Okay, but then what do they do for OP's husband's birthday? Have another party that day? Celebrate with a cupcake and a candle? Have a party not on his birthday if he wants to invite friends/family because his twin has bogarted the actual date? \n\nTurning down the party invite was because it was a birthday party for half of a set of twins on the date with friends and *family*. Meaning they all know it's also husband's birthday and yet I bet you no one will be allowed to bring it up because 'baw, the spotlight.'"]}
