They are very different people.  BIL was always social, an athlete, and liked to party.  He's now a police officer.  My husband was an introvert, scholarly, and liked to read.  He served in the Army and is now a lawyer.  They didn't socialize much as kids, because they didn't have a lot in common, but my husband considered their relationship to be good.\n\nBoth brothers married about 11 years ago, within a few months of each other.  The four of us got along well at first, despite having different interests, and I hoped we'd have a friendly in-law relationship.  However, the relationship has steadily deteriorated over time.  There has never been an overt fight, but at this stage neither couple is interested in being in a room with the other.  \n\nFrom our perspective, BIL and SIL just don't seem to like us (which is confusing but is their right), and this plays out in exclusionary ways (which isn't ok).  Examples:\n\n* They ask us when we will be available for family Christmas Eve dinner, and then deliberately host the event for a time we said we'd still be at work\n* They invite the immediate family to a dinner for their child's birthday, but then serve only pizza and cake, despite knowing that I'm gluten-intolerant.\n\nWe're currently at an inflection point, because the animosity between the two brothers is now causing tensions between my husband and his parents, which may ultimately result in a no-contact decision.  I'm reflecting on what brought us here.  I know that there political and socioeconomic differences between our two families that have caused tensions, but on a personal level I know we've tried to be kind and helpful family members.  However, I keep thinking about one event early on in our marriage(s) in which I might have been the asshole, and wondering/worrying if that was the turning point that starting building their animosity towards us.\n\nFor my BIL's first birthday after their wedding, my SIL planned a large surprise birthday for him, to be held on the day of his birthday.  She invited their friends, her family, and our entire extended family, including my husband and I.  She did not acknowledge that it was also my husband's birthday.  On a personal level, I thought this was incredibly rude.  My husband felt unenthusiastic and weird about spending his birthday at a party that was only to celebrate his twin's birthday.  I wanted my husband to be able to feel special on his birthday, so we politely declined the invitation and went out to a nice dinner, just the two of us.  This felt reasonable to me, but I also feel like the tension between the two couples began growing after that event, ultimately leading us to where we are today.

Most folks don't really understand how incredibly difficult it is to navigate different friends, different preferences, different temperments, gifts from guests for BOTH??? ugh.... and I really dreaded my birthday because of it.  :(   \n\nanyways, it's unreasonable for SIL to expect ya'll to want to spend your husband's birthday at an event that doesn't even acknowledge that it's both birthday celebrations (especially if there were shared friends and family).  \n\nYour husband is allowed to do birthdays with or without his twin as is your twin, so it was nice for you to get an invite, but not unreasonable for you not to go.  I think you did the superbly graceful thing here by bowing out and giving your husband a lovely birthday outing, and the SIL should try to understand that.  \n\nMy solution to this was to move very far away and now, birthdays are fun again.", "NTA, they didn't want to celebrate your husbands birthday. You two wanted to and should do. You did the right thing. Honestly no contact seems good, his family doesn't respect him.", "NTA.\n\nI can relate to how your husband must have felt in that \"non-celebration\" for him. I shared my birthday with my grandmother, and i didn't like it when people had to be reminded every year that it was my birthday too. As an adult your husband had every right to decide how to celebrate his birthday even if it was away from family.\n\nIf you're feeling anxious of reaching the no-contact point with your husband's family, you can try reaching out as a last-ditch effort to salvage the relationship, but start small. At least you tried.", "NTA. That's just bizarre to be invited to a birthday party exclusively for your husband's twin. How the heck did your BIL and SIL expect you and your husband to feel?", "No. NTA to not go to a birthday party for a twin without the other twin being celebrated.  She could have reached out to you and made this a joint party.  Alas.  Even your husband didn't want to go.  To your SIL, your husband is spare parts for her husband.  Nothing more.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  I don't understand how the family can celebrate one twin's birthday without at least a discussion of why the other twin's birthday is to celebrated.  I mean if your husband doesn't celebrate his birthday, that's one thing.  But to host and organize party where almost all the attendees know that there is another celebrant is inconsiderate and rude.", "NTA - SIL started this by having a surprise birthday party for only one twin, expecting the twin brother to pretend it\u2019s not his birthday too.  This isn\u2019t just about twins.. in my family and my husband\u2019s family, we have clustered birthdays.  It would be rude to have a birthday party on the same day as a relative\u2019s birthday and not celebrate them too.  It sounds like SIL expected your husband to act like he doesn\u2019t have a twin, he has a brother and it\u2019s not his birthday too\u2026 MIL and FIL should have explained to her, that that is rude and she needs to accommodate or include this as a twins thing.  They didn\u2019t. So, yes, you irked them by not showing up but SIL caused that problem.  As for the gluten thing, I was raised to ask guest and understand guest\u2019s allergies, preferences, etc because if I am hosting I should have foods to accommodate them.  It\u2019s one thing to not know, but it\u2019s quite another to know and not care.\n\nYour BIL and SIL are self centered and vindictive.  They do what they want and they don\u2019t care how that affects family.  It is vindictive to ask what time you are available for a Christmas Eve family dinner and then set the time so that you cannot attend.  I hosted Christmas Eve for years (we actually would have dinner out), but I would contact everyone who wanted to come and would set the time to fit everyone\u2019s schedule. I would never pick a time with close family couldn\u2019t attend because that would be rude and callous.  Why did they bother asking when you were free unless they really wanted to know when you weren\u2019t free\u2026 I have spent a couple of hours each year figuring out with family what day and time worked for everyone.  But that\u2019s what you do when you want to be caring and inclusive.\n\nWe are all different\u2026 some are extroverts and some are introverts.  Being an extrovert is not an excuse to be rude, vindictive, or unkind.\n\nYou and your husband are adults, and as adults, you get to decide who you want to associate with or not.  I would suggest you create your own traditions and do you own thing rather than being constantly dissed by the ILs.", "NTA.  Sounds reasonable.  Stop bothering with these people.  Relatives you are stuck with, family you choose.", "If they are choosing to create permanent tension over declining one event then you\u2019re NTA.\n\nHowever, you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case here. It sounds like a natural build up of people with different personalities and expectations.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to say how much, if at all, your examples of them were vindictive. Maybe the time you were at work worked best for everyone overall. Maybe they were so focused on serving their child\u2019s favorites that they were a bit thoughtless.\n\nEven when it comes to your husband\u2019s birthday there\u2019s space for nuance. Your husband is an introvert. Would he really want to be the center of a huge party? If I were his brother\u2019s family I might think your husband would prefer if we didn\u2019t highlight him at all, pespecially if your husband didn\u2019t know everyone there or the party was relatively big.\n\nThe obvious solution to this was of course for someone in the family to talk to your husband. However, I get the sense the family doesn\u2019t communicate well.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t feel too guilty here. It sounds like a mutual decision. However, if this separation is bothering your husband it\u2019s okay for him to try and build bridges.", "NTA\n\nAs someone whose birthday always seemed to be overshadowed by another family members engagement, wedding, baby shower, anniversary, etc. I feel the pain of being forced to suck it up and pretend to be happy being dragged to a location not of my choosing to celebrate someone else\u2019s big moment. That we can celebrate me at a more convenient time because this is a special moment for someone else. \n\nYou are definitely NTA for celebrating your husbands birthday instead of his twin brothers birthday. It should be obvious to everyone involved why you would want to do so, but sadly I know firsthand that some people are too self centered to see past themselves.", "NTA it seems to me his brother doesn't like nor want him in his life. So going NC seems like the right idea. Your husband doesn't need that crap om his life. I mean they are twins and she pretended otherwise.so yeah let them have your IN-LAWS and everyone else. Good Luck", "NAH but if there is any A-holery, you're included in it. Your SIL should not be expected to throw a party for your husband even if he was born on the same day as her's. She's not their mommy. And how do you know she wouldn't have acknowledged your husband? You didn't show up.", "Without knowing more about the political differences at the heart of the \"tensions\" between your families, I don't think there is enough information here for a judgment. \n\nYour sister-in-law going to the trouble of putting together a big surprise party for her husband but not making it a joint party is strange, but only because your husband was born on the same day. It doesn't sound like you proposed making it a shared celebration or volunteered to do any of the work, you just expected that she would center your husband without any input from you two. Did you talk to them at any point about how you and your husband felt, or did you just decline the invitation without any explanation?", "I'm gonna say NTA if you both received the invitation for bith of you stating is wasa surprise party for your BIL.  If you received the invite, just you, no mention of your husband, than YTA because that would tell me it was a surprise for both of them.\n\nI do have to ask, did SIL make you, just you aware of the party prior to the invitations being sent out, or even to discuss the idea of the party beforehand?  If she did either of those than you dropped the ball because that would tell me that she was trying to indicate she wanted you to add your invites, and contribution to the party for your husband to be part of the celebration, but she sucks at communication.\n\nWhat I'm also curious about is how the family felt about the exclusion of your husband?", "If neither of you wanted to attend the party, that's fine.\n\nNTA", "BIL is a cop. Nuff said. NTA", "NTA. The birthday thing and the deliberately scheduling during times when you are unavailable is a dick move. Probably best just to give back the energy they put in unless it\u2019s just toxic - then cut and run.", ">large surprise birthday\n\nUhhh.. is it at all possible that your husband was going to be included as a surprise? And that your SIL was just trying to, you know, keep it a surprise..? I mean, just from this story, I feel like she dropped enough hints to kind of say \"hey wink wink I'm throwing a surprise party. Tell hubby that it's just for his brother lol it's gonna be great\", and you just said \"fuck off we're going to dinner by ourselves\"\n\nNTA though, just seems like a miscommunication", "YTA-  its not up to SIL to hold a party for your husband. thats your job.  You could have easily gone, stay an hour and then gone do your own thing.\n\nPlus whatever relationship the twins have, is on them not you, not the parents and not SIL. If they want to talk, they will, if they dont well they don't. That isnt your job.", "Y-T-A for expecting them to fix foods especially for you at a kid\u2019s birthday party.  Eat before you go the same way us vegetarians do when we know there won\u2019t be much or anything we can eat.  Who expects more than pizza and cake at a kids\u2019 party.  YTA since it was you who refused to attend BILs party.  That should have been 100% your husband\u2019s decision.  I smell that an entitled, demanding, self-centered wife\u2019s behavior has caused this divide and I\u2019m not talking about your BIL\u2019s wife.", "YTA for declining the birthday invite. From the info provided, you didn't try and suggest to your SIL that you chip in and both of you co-host the party for the twins.\n\nNext, I don't believe in acting like an AH just because someone else is behaving like one. Yes, your SIL overlooked the fact that her hubby has a twin. But by being the only ones not present at the party, you both made yourselves look bad.\n\nWould it have been so bad to show up for while at least?\n\nAs for your overall contribution to the deterioration of the relationship, I think it's limited. Your BIL and SIL seem envious of you both and your financial means. If your political values don't align, it makes it that much more fractious.\n\nI would choose to deal with this relationship with grace and the maximum benefit of doubt. Not let others' pettiness get to me and anchor myself in my own conduct, not the conduct of others.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We started having 2 parties at the age of 6 or 7 because they were 2 different people.. I law a lot of blame for the over all family. my sis and i are also twins but on different years.. my parents/ family would never celebrate only one birthday.

If it is, that would be really petty on your SIL / BIL side. It's kind of tempting to start to speculate on a big reason for the erosion of their relationship, but it's very possible it's just an accumulation of little reasons.  \n\nEven though speculation can be fun especially here on reddit. It sounds like if you really want to stop their relationship eroding any further, guessing time is over and open and honest conversation time is needed. \n\nMaybe without the spouses at first. Maybe brother and brother can enjoy some shared interest together and figure out what is holding their relationship back and what they want their relationship to look like going forward.", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say INFO. Please hear me out, OP.\n\nI'm a twin too - my sister and I have always been very close. We also have really different lives. While we've tried to share moments equally, it's just reality that sometimes one of us has the spotlight, and that's okay. We've had combined birthday parties, as well as parties that were planned for me by my friends that she came to (and then naturally, we were both kinda celebrated, were both sung to, etc.)\n\nThat dynamic feels equal while also allowing us to have our own identities, and it is also something I could imagine is hard to understand if you're not a twin. I don't think your in-laws were wrong to want a party for just your BIL. You also don't know what they would have done for your husband had you been there. Your husband might have been more included in the fun than you both thought he would be.\n\nI also don't think that's the reason they're distant. You don't have nearly enough information. I would suggest opening up a conversation and asking if anything went wrong between you all and how to improve things, and let them know how you feel too. You'll be shocked at how much that gesture would mean to them. The situation doesn't seem insidious and *definitely* doesn't justify going no contact. It's just an icy few years that can happen between adults.\n\nFamily (and twin) relationships are everything if you're lucky to have them, and they take work and vulnerability. I wish you all the best of luck!", "You did the right thing.  Her SIL deliberately excluded her husband (it was cruel).  I am in a similar situation and I know what it feels like to be scorned on your birthday.  My birthday is the same day as my grandfather and great-grandmother: August 20.  So my birthday is not celebrated.  They throw a big party for my grandfather and they don't congratulate me at all.  I once heard my aunt say that I was not her daughter and that she did not have to give me a cake or a party.  My parents are divorced and absent.  Feeling like an intruder on your own birthday is not pretty.  You have not done anything, you have shown that you will not tolerate their slights and rudeness.  Keep it up, always support her husband and believe me, on a birthday it is always better to have quality than quantity. :)", "NTA.  It's not a boycott lol.

At the time, it felt to me like it would be rude to ask someone if we could tack another guest of honor on to a party she'd already planned.", "That's asking too much of OP, who was not going to impose on a party that was clearly being thrown exclusively for his twin brother. The invitation was just weird. OP owed no explanation as to why they would not go.", "No, both my husband and I received a facebook invite to the party at the same time, after it had been fully planned.  She did not reach out to me in advance at all.    My husband's parents didn't seem to clock the situation as strange at all, but they also supported the Christmas Eve situation b/c they believe that it's an event host's right to do as they please since they're the ones going through the effort of hosting.", "Nope, both OP and husband were invited at the same time: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111e1wg/comment/j8ehalh/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "She wasn't asking for a party for her husband, but to invite everyone on the planet, including the TWIN BROTHER where the twin would be a guest for his twin's birthday on his birthday and not have that acknowledged in any way is both rude and weird.\n\nThey didn't make a fuss, they went and celebrated his birthday, alone, since no one else seemed interested. Why would they be somehow required to show up and acknowledge that event, given the completely lack of reciprocal recognition?\n\nI'd get your response if they kicked up some kind of dramatic fuss and made a big deal about not attending, but they didn't do that.

It\u2019s an asshole move to host a party and have nothing to eat for a close family member you know has food allergies/intolerances. Also, I\u2019m dating a twin and I can\u2019t imagine throwing a birthday party where both are invited but only one is being celebrated.

There's the assumption that it started with the birthday thing, which was incredibly rude of SIL...  it threw it up in your husband's face that his birthday was NOT being celebrated.  But, since you don't really know, it's just an assumption.\n\nMy suggestion would be for your husband to reach out to his brother and have a 1:1 conversation (no spouses) with him to try to get to the bottom of what's going on.  Hopefully whatever happened is just a misunderstanding that got blown way out of proportion, and can be worked through.  If it did have something to do with the birthday, then it's your husband's opportunity to tell his brother that it would have been appreciated if SIL had asked if they wanted to make it a joint party, but as it was, it just sent the wrong message.  \n\nAnd after that, if the two brothers can't get on the same page, then you can choose to go NC.\n\nGood luck!", "Then NTA.

That is like hostessing 101", "Yeah. I always make sure that all my guests can eat.

Sounds like they throw parties based on what works for them, and you guys aren't a major priority. But that's fine, since you don't want to go to their parties anyway (I'm assuming you host them sometimes, right?).\n\nRe: the birthday party. Your SIL is allowed to have a great surprise party for her husband without also making it for his twin, who may not even know or care to socialize with his brother's friends. She invited you guys because you are family. You didn't go--oh well. I doubt that's the only reason you don't want to hang out together.", "NAH in this specific situation.\n\nTwins are allowed to have separate parties. Sure maybe at the party acknowledge the twin but doesn\u2019t have to be a joint party, individuals can be celebrated too.

You did absolutely nothing wrong and would've been within your rights to be less polite about the whole thing.", "NTA. Though you were wandering a little close expecting people to make you a special dish at their kid's party. This in general isn't an expectation of hosts who aren't airlines.\n\nAlso OP consider putting a little less identifying info in this post if you want privacy. It isn't necessary and people who know you would easily recognize your family from this description.", "How is it exclusion if she's throwing a party specifically for her husband?

If you host a party you need to make sure everyone has something they can eat.", "So then why are you upset that your SIL's focus is her husband's birthday? Both brothers are now adults with their own families. It's very probable that she sent a token invite think y'all were going to celebrate separately on another day if it was a work day for both or just your husband or have more quiet affair since the brothers are of different temperaments. You don't know because you never asked."]}
