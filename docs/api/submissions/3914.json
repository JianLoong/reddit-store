I don\u2019t think his initial ask was necessarily an issue, even though it\u2019s a little weird\u2026.then he moved solidly into AH territory when he got angry and insulted you because you weren\u2019t comfortable with it.", "NTA. Really strange request but did he ever ask his GF about this \"date\" idea?", "NTA. She\u2019s not a puppy.", "NTA you aren\u2019t responsible for keeping this guy\u2019s girlfriend entertained, even if he\u2019s paying. This is such a weird ask. Like, I know he said her friends are busy, but an adult woman should have enough of a life outside her relationship that her boyfriend doesn\u2019t need to arrange a babysitter for her. I have a hunch your friend might be an AH in that relationship, but he\u2019s definitely the AH for getting mad that you said no to this request. And wtf is this about throwing away trust? This isn\u2019t the kind of thing you trust someone to do or count on your friends for. This is the kind of thing you can force underlings to do when you\u2019re a crime boss, and it\u2019s still weird then.", "NTA, it\u2019s not your job to keep her entertained\n\nBesides she might force you into a dance competition before ODing on your heroin", "NTA. Why does his adult girlfriend need a babysitter?", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to take anyone on a date if you don\u2019t want.", "NTA this request on your friend\u2019s part is strange and inappropriate. As someone else wrote, it\u2019s fine if he asks you to check in on her, but what he\u2019s asking you to do is so awkward.", "INFO: did he ask you to \u201ctake her on a date\u201d or just to hang out with her and he\u2019d spot you some money to pay for it?  Either way it\u2019s weird that she has to have play dates arranged for her while her boyfriend is gone. And he sounds very weird for being unable to take No for an answer.", "NTA. That is a weird ask.", "NTA:   \nWtf is this logic", "NTA. It's one thing to ask a friend to check on your partner for safety reasons, but why does she need to be shown a \"good time\"? That's a recipe for disaster for the friendship.", "NTA. if you're not comfortable, don't do it", "Is your friend Marsellus Wallace? NTA.", "NTA. he asked you to do something. you declined. that should be the end of it.", "NTA your friend sounds pretty entitled, he's your friend not your boss", "Nta.\n\nSounds like your friend's girlfriend is pretty needs. Maybe he is also doing this as surveillance.  \n\nIt's a strange ask to take her on a \"date\". Sounds like you and his girlfriend aren't that close otherwise hanging out as mutual friends would be a pretty easy ask. Your friend throwing down doing you a favor eating in a place you'd never afford is condescending.  Maybe true but surely not helping his ask.\n\nNot your problem if she doesn't have any available friends. I read in Japan you can hire people to just sit and eat with you. Maybe that's what your friend needs. Fly a guy over from Japan for month.", "NTA. And I have a feeling his real intention was to check up on her. \n\nI\u2019d be so insulted if I was her. \n\nShe can live without him. And I\u2019m sure if she genuinely couldn\u2019t he could fly her to where he\u2019s working for a few nights over the month? \n\nI also hate people asking for a favour and expecting the only answer to be yes!", "NTA\n\nHe asked. You answered. That should have been the end of it. \n\nAlso he\u2019s wrong to just assume you have the time to do it anyway. Yes you might not have to go to work, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t already have other things scheduled or that you prefer or need to do.", "You are free to say no, so no NAH, but I don\u2019t get why you seem offended that he asked. He\u2019s not asking for an escort service, just a favour from a friend, and he\u2019s paying. He doesn\u2019t want his gf to be alone, and if you like and get on with her maybe you can be sympathetic to that, and do a solid for your buddy too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A grown ass woman can figure out how to spend a month without you babysitting. What a bizarre, Pulp Fiction inspired ask.", "NTA - She is your girlfriend so you don't have to do anything with her and your friend isn't much of a friend if he thinks he can demand your time to entertain his girlfriend.\n\nHis girlfriend is a grown woman, she's old enough to find her own entertainment.", "NTA \n\nAsking you to take his girlfriend on a date is odd! \n\nAnd you are allowed to say no if you are uncomfortable", "NTA wtf", "nta\n\nthis is too much to ask of u. Hes trying to dumb it down as a simple favor but u arent comfortable with it, and that is okay. it is NOT okay for him to continue to push on this tho", "NTA. You can eat with whoever you want. And your friends insult you are too poor to afford the meal in your own definitely makes him the AH. But why don\u2019t you want to do it? Don\u2019t you like her or do you like her too much?", "NTA - this is the weirdest thing ever\u2026 it seems fishy/scammy? Is he trying to pawn her off on you? Trying to lead into a threesome or something?", "NTA\nI'm normally against assuming, but based off your post alone it seems like you were uncomfortable taking his girlfriend somewhere. And having a brother who's best friend's wife (now ex) didnt like to be alone either, she really needs to grow up. Shes an adult, a month without her friends or boyfriend is not that bad. They can still talk they just cant see each other for a month. She could still go out and do things or make new friends with similar schedules to hers. \n\nMy brother's best friend is in a branch of the army (marines or air force, I dont remember because he switched) and was being deployed for 2 weeks. His wife at the time didnt want to be alone for 2 weeks, at his house. She was crazy, so hes trying to divorce her. Not even a year after the incident happened. (There was a whole ordeal with my brother and his wife being up their with his friends wife) \n\nYou are NTA \nFriends gf needs to grow up \nFriend needs to learn how to read a room.", "NTA. When Lee Majors and Farrah Fawcett were together, he asked his good friend Ryan O'Neal to take Farrah Fawcett out while he (Majors) was out of town filming. We all know how that turned out.", "NTA. What kind of weird ass request was that?? My girlfriend doesn't have any friends or family to spend time with... so please take her out on a romantic meal for me?? Oh you dont want to because the thought of it makes you uncomfortable to the pjt of your stomach? Let me just crank the already weird up several more notches with my response. A step back from this mess would be a good idea.", "NTA.  It sounds a bit weird anyway.  But your friend gets to ask and you get to say no thank you to anything that makes you uncomfortable.  As a good friend, you step up for a medical emergency, you listen to your friend when he needs an ear, but you don't have to take his high maintenance GF out on a fancy date with trimming many people might consider a tad on the romantic side when he's out of town or listen to his feeble attempts to guilt trip you into compliance.  He's being a bad, manipulative friend.  If he doesn't drop it, preferably with an apology, you might want to back away for a while.  Possibly a very long while.", "NTA, that sounds super uncomfortable and not like something I'd enjoy doing. It seems like it would be very awkward. It was fine of him to ask, but he should have been willing to accept a no from you.", "NTA - tbh, it sounds like he wants to keep her busy so she doesn\u2019t cheat or something?? Does he not trust her? I hate that that\u2019s the feeling I get, but I honestly don\u2019t understand this logic. Does she even know about the date? Just weirdness all around", "I agree with you. But the original ask is a LOT weird.  GF is treated like a dependent or material possession that needs to be babysat or maintained.\n\nIt would be a world of difference if it was GF who approached OP and said, \"Hey, my BF and I talked about it and we thought to ask if you're cool with going on a friend date with me sometimes this month, as I'll be bored. I'll pay, of course.\"\n\nOtherwise this is equal to BF saying,   \"Hey OP, could you run my car's engine while I'm away?\"", "If she has no friends of her own, yet still needs to be with someone, that's weird as hell, and OP would need to be extra careful about getting involved.", "I see where you\u2019re coming from, I was mainly thinking that maybe she\u2019s been having a hard time or is very socially anxious and the BF was trying to look out for her. Of course, this is all conjecture since we don\u2019t actually know any of the people involved, but I could see there being certain contexts where the initial request isn\u2019t outlandish. BF\u2019s subsequent responses makes it pretty clear he\u2019s just weird all around though :)", "It seems weirdly controlling too, unless she legit doesn't have her own friends. Like if my boyfriend paid for one of his friends to go out with me instead of, y'know, one of my friend's and my night out (not that he'd do the later, lmaooooooo), that'd feel so ick.", "Ya, from his weird nature I feel like he needs someone to monitor his girl while he's away"]}
