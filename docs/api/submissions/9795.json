And really, does your ex expect you to take her two kids for breakfast on the way too, or could dropping the youngest off at a different school cut into the available time leave no time for for you to have together.", "NTA\n\nThey are her kids, not yours. You have no obligation to them or your ex for that matter. Plus, you doing this gives you time with your daughter.", "So she wants you to change the 1 on 1 time you have with your daughter to being her personal baby taxi service? You are well in your right to say no just because of that. Thats Your time with Your daughter. NTA", "NTA that quality time with your kid actually matters even if it\u2019s just a ride to school. I still remember going to school and my dad or mom driving me and getting Starbucks or maybe a breakfast sandwich and talking about football.\n\nEveryone is an asshole to somebody.

It\u2019s so so so important for a non-custodial parent to spend time with their kids. My father was AWFUL. He was a narcissist who really only cared about winning over the favor of friends and family, and actively would tell us he didn\u2019t love us as much as he loved our mother. \n\nIt would\u2019ve meant the world to me, especially if I was living with step-siblings, to have dedicated time in the morning to see my dad on the way to school. It\u2019s CRUCIAL to get that special time with a parent, especially after a divorce.\n\nLife isn\u2019t always fair and equal. The other kids aren\u2019t his, and it won\u2019t kill them to take the bus. I took the bus for 6 years after my parents divorce, as did both my siblings. It\u2019s the mother\u2019s job to explain that the father isn\u2019t just picking up and dropping off his kid, he\u2019s spending special time with her that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise get together. Then she can offer to facilitate them having special breakfasts or time with their dad.\n\nWhat it boils down to is, this isn\u2019t about just driving a kid to and from school. This is about spending special dedicated time with his daughter on a regular basis to make sure they have a strong bond. \n\nKudos to you OP. I wish my dad had done that for me even once.", "NTA. You are able to give YOUR daughter a ride. That's great father/daughter time.  You are not responsible for getting your ex's children to school.", "NTA. You're not their guardian or their biological father, therefore, you should not be driving them around. Let's say you drive them, but get in an accident; what are the legal consequences? This is enough to say no to your ex-wife, and if she doesn't understand, that's her problem.", "NTA\n\nIf you wish to spend some quality time with your daughter like having breakfast together and spending more time together it\u2018s normal that you wish to do so with your daughter only. \n\nIf you only picked her up and dropped her off it would be kind of petty not to take the other ones along since you\u2018re doing the trip anyway.

You should not be made to feel guilty for this.", "NTA\n\nSounds like it's a great opportunity for you to spend some time with your daughter, and I'm sure she has enough other situations in her life where her siblings have other advantages due to (assumably) living with their bio dad.\n\nIf I were you, I would only consider driving the other kids, if your daughter asked for it or expressed concern about them not being included.", "Nta.

I am not sure why your ex isn't harping that guy. She should be happy you are making your daughter in a better situation versus being an absent father.

They have to learn they have different fathers, different grandparent and different experiences.", "NTA. You're right. Her kids aren't your responsibility. You're spending daddy/daughter time with your child while also doing her a service in getting her to and from school. That'd be like asking you to take her other kids with you when you go skating/out to a movie on summer break because 'her other kids are jealous and they want to have fun too'. Not your kids, not your problem. \n\nEven if you weren't doing breakfast/spending time, it's not your problem. I bet she'd demand you buy them breakfast/hang out too, because 'fairness'. Well, you're not their dad, so she needs to get over you being fair to her other kids.", "NTA but do consider that depending on your custody arrangement your ex might be within her rights to not allow you to drive your daughter back and forth. It would be wrong but possibly very legal. So you might consider an occasional compromise just to keep things copacetic.", "NTA but you could say that you don't want to cut off time you spent with your daughter.", "NTA if you are using this time to talk and have breakfast with your daughter, hard to do with two others along - would you have them just sit somewhere while you spent 20 minutes talking?\n\nIt would be different if ALL you were doing was giving the quickest possible lift yo school.", "NTA.. They are not your responsibility and the legal implications if an accident happens on the way to and from school are big..\nBut just to be kind, ask your daughter, if she wants to share the ride at least once in a while then do it just for her sake.", "NTA\n\nu/MixConstant4266 \n\nNot your kids, not your responsability. If she wants them to not ride by bus, she should take them.\n\nAnyway i see you use these rides to spent extra time with your kid.\n\nYou might have problems in the future with your daughter's gifts and trips - your ex's kids are already jealous.\n\nEdit: Is she always like this? Where's the father of her kids?", "NTA - They aren't your kids. If your ex's kids are jealous, perhaps she should do a better job as a mother.", "NTA- you have a right just to spend time with your own child. Taking a kid to school isn\u2019t really about getting them there. It is about having time to talk and bond. Even more true if you are getting breakfast on the way. I would suggest perhaps a compromise though to keep tensions down. Maybe once or twice a week you could take one or more of her siblings to school too just to be nice? I would not give up that individual time with your child though.", "NTA, it's great that you've found a way to spend extra time with your daughter.", "NTA\nPeople need to learn that not everything is for everyone.

You are right, it would damage your father daughter time to have it infringed upon. Clearly this not just a ride, it is a bonding time for you to have a meal together and catch up on what happens during the day. Ex is also right that carpooling is a thing, and from her kids point of view this is seen as preferential treatment for the older sister.
