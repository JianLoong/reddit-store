You have no obligation to them or your ex for that matter.

You are well in your right to say no just because of that. Thats Your time with Your daughter. NTA", "NTA that quality time with your kid actually matters even if it\u2019s just a ride to school.

It\u2019s so so so important for a non-custodial parent to spend time with their kids. My father was AWFUL.

It\u2019s CRUCIAL to get that special time with a parent, especially after a divorce.\n\nLife isn\u2019t always fair and equal. The other kids aren\u2019t his, and it won\u2019t kill them to take the bus. I took the bus for 6 years after my parents divorce, as did both my siblings. It\u2019s the mother\u2019s job to explain that the father isn\u2019t just picking up and dropping off his kid, he\u2019s spending special time with her that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise get together. Then she can offer to facilitate them having special breakfasts or time with their dad.\n\nWhat it boils down to is, this isn\u2019t about just driving a kid to and from school. This is about spending special dedicated time with his daughter on a regular basis to make sure they have a strong bond. \n\nKudos to you OP. I wish my dad had done that for me even once.", "NTA. You are able to give YOUR daughter a ride. That's great father/daughter time.  You are not responsible for getting your ex's children to school.", "NTA. You're not their guardian or their biological father, therefore, you should not be driving them around. Let's say you drive them, but get in an accident; what are the legal consequences?

They have to learn they have different fathers, different grandparent and different experiences.", "NTA. You're right. Her kids aren't your responsibility. You're spending daddy/daughter time with your child while also doing her a service in getting her to and from school. That'd be like asking you to take her other kids with you when you go skating/out to a movie on summer break because 'her other kids are jealous and they want to have fun too'. Not your kids, not your problem. \n\nEven if you weren't doing breakfast/spending time, it's not your problem. I bet she'd demand you buy them breakfast/hang out too, because 'fairness'. Well, you're not their dad, so she needs to get over you being fair to her other kids.", "NTA but do consider that depending on your custody arrangement your ex might be within her rights to not allow you to drive your daughter back and forth.

Where's the father of her kids?", "NTA - They aren't your kids. If your ex's kids are jealous, perhaps she should do a better job as a mother.", "NTA- you have a right just to spend time with your own child. Taking a kid to school isn\u2019t really about getting them there. It is about having time to talk and bond. Even more true if you are getting breakfast on the way.

Making his ex\u2019s life easier is not part of the equation. Your fantastical thinking that OP is responsible for every kid in his daughter\u2019s life is amazing.", "Enough time to get food, which I bet you money that the mom would expect him to do for her other kids.", "I think they meant everyone is perceived as an asshole by some people, even if they aren\u2019t.", "How is he being an asshole to the other kids?  He\u2019s not just driving to/from school, he\u2019s doing activities with his daughter. Is he supposed to take her siblings to breakfast to? On their outings after school?", "He\u2019s not being an asshole. They are not his kids, if the mother wants her kids to not have to ride the school bus then she or their father can do it. Life isn\u2019t fair. His daughter is growing up in a house without her father. Her siblings have both their parents under the same roof. When you have babies with multiple people that\u2019s the reality for your kids, someone will always miss out on something.", ">talking about a grown man happily being an asshole to 11 and 8-year-old children\n\nHow is he an asshole??", "Hahahahahahahahaha... HOW is he being an insane asshole!?\n\nThey are her NEW husbands kids, not his!!\nHe has time for a breakfast with HIS daughter and take her to school, you really, honestly, think he will still have the time to do so, and I guess according to you he MUST feed the NEW husbands kids also, and then taxi them to TWO different schools!? Becaaaause???", "By that logic, aren\u2019t you being an asshole to those kids to? You\u2019re not their parent, and you aren\u2019t giving them rides to school, just like OP.", "How exactly is OP being an AH?", "What?", " I'm free to take her to school and bring her back. We usually get breakfast on our way to school or we spend some time afterwards.", "It's not favoritism when he does not have a relationship with those other kids. If she's getting shit from her mom's kids over this, that's her mom's fault and her problem to fix.", "Whether or not there\u2019s truly an imbalance depends on how the stepfather treats OP\u2019s daughter. Plenty of step parents treat their bio/legal kids the same as their step kids. We don\u2019t know if that is or isn\u2019t going on in OP\u2019s ex wife\u2019s household.", "I don\u2019t think that the only choice of OP is go buy breakfast with daughter before school or not spend time with her. In fact, OP states he spends time with his daughter after school. That would not change because he\u2019s dropping off others. Carpooling children\u2019s transportation is not a giant deal in general. If the breakfast time is that important, OP could choose to \u2026 make breakfast at home each day before picking up? \n\nIn any case, my judgement was that he wasn\u2019t an AH, and I continue to think that. I merely pointed out that there are other factors at play, and it\u2019s up to him to make the calculations. If he chooses to carry on as he is now, that\u2019s fine.", "And that\u2019s the most important thing. This is important bonding time with your daughter. Don\u2019t give it up. NTA", "More than just that.  Having to make a second pick up in the afternoon.   Would you have to wait in line a 2nd time?\n\nAlso:  if you were to do it 5 days a week for 6 months, I guarantee something goes wrong several times. Someone is late or someone needs to get dropped of somewhere else.  \n\nIt will definitely be an inconvenience at some point.", "None of what you said is wrong, and it doesn\u2019t contradict my statement or standpoint either.

You are doing great!", "Have you ask what your daughter wants?", "I think it's weird how bad you talk about your daughter's siblings l.", "[deleted]", "Im not sure how that other clown managed to twist my words that bad but I\u2019m glad you understood \ud83d\ude02", "Then yes, you\u2019re NTA. it\u2019s more if you weren\u2019t doing these things I\u2019d say you were in the wrong because it would be creating unnecessary issues, but if you\u2019re spending time with her then fair play. But I\u2019d ask your daughter how she feels about it, because if the siblings are making a big deal and are resenting her for it, then you might need to deal with that before it effects all their mental health\u2019s (your daughters and siblings).", "How is making breakfast at home supposed to make up for having breakfast with his child?", "Oh it will be an inconvenience the very first time. \n\nWaiting in one pickup line is bad enough. Waiting in TWO for a kid that\u2019s not even yours is irritating. Plus having the two younger kids effectively blocks the dad from having any meaningful conversation with his daughter.", "It directly contradicts your entire statement because you frame this as preferential treatment. It is not.", "Respectfully, to not take them to breakfast and on outings, he would then have to pick up his daughter even earlier so he would have time to go back and get them. I guarantee this would cause a problem of them being intentionally left out of breakfast and whatnot. Where does it end? \n\nThis is precious time with his daughter.", "So how would he drive them to school if he doesn\u2019t include them in the activities?", "Sorry, but no. He shouldn't have to bargain with his ex wife to take care of her other children not related to him by blood or marriage so he gets extra time with his child. He's doing this because he got hours shifted in his work so he has the time to take her to/from school. He found a way to make it a win so that he can spend extra time with his child, bonding and doing her a service in also getting her to school. I very much disagree that any parent should have to bargain or wheedle extra time and do things they clearly don't want to do just to have access to their child who clearly wants to spend time with them. \n\nI get that your heart is in the right place, but this is going to turn something that's been fun and beneficial for father and daughter into a shitty obligation because he clearly doesn't like these kids and it seems she doesn't either. No more breakfasts, because he'd have to pay for them too, and no more after school fun time, because why would he with her other children? This doesn't benefit the daughter or father at all and frankly, as the mom, I'd be embarrassed. Get their father to drive them, drive them herself, or let them deal with the bus the way every other kid on the bus has to. It's not detrimental to them. They're getting to school. They just \\~want to be driven.", "I assumed it would be together?", "For sure. I\u2019m stoked for op that he gets to have this time with her. \n\nI\u2019m just saying it\u2019s a nuanced situation with sibling relationships as a factor to consider- and not even the most important factor which is of course time with his kid. \n\nI think if it was me, I\u2019d probably drop drive-thru breakfast and say yes to getting them to school in the morning. After school, they can get themselves home while I took her for ice cream or whatever. \n\nBut it ain\u2019t me and OP will have to decide his own way. Either way he won\u2019t be TA, just a good dad.", "If it was me, I\u2019d drop drive-thru breakfast and get everyone to school and have the others find their own way back. Then only pick up my daughter for ice cream or whatever activity. \n\nBut that\u2019s just my approach. OP is free to do whatever he thinks is best- absolutely guilt free. He\u2019s not TA either way. I just think the situation is nuanced.", "I totally get what you are saying, I'm thinking it more of a way to get more time with his daughter.  I get what you are saying,  but as someone who has been the left out kid, it doesn't feel good and alienates the other siblings.  \n\nIt's always tricky with parents and steps.", "I\u2019d imagine OP\u2019s daughter would be upset about losing that morning time with her dad. I would have, if I were her. It\u2019s not about breakfast, it\u2019s about the time they spend together.\n\n I do agree the situation is difficult and could cause resentment between OP\u2019s daughter and her half siblings. But honestly, if I were OP\u2019s daughter, I\u2019d happily live with the resentment over losing one-on-one time with my parent.", "Then I'm sorry to say this and I don't mean it disrespectfully, but your parents are the ones you should be mad at, not the person not related to you. You and these girls are the obligation of the people that brought you into this world. They should do better. Her trying to put the onus of her children that aren't his being happy is a dick move. She's a dick. If your parents allowed you to feel left out because one of your half siblings got it better at their bio family's home and you got shafted, I'm sorry. Genuinely. Foster kid here, so I know all about being left out. But blaming him or trying to guilt him into being 'the good guy to not rock the boat' is taking all the responsibility from where it belongs (ie; the mom and actual father) and shoving it onto him, when he has no horse in the race. Truth of the matter is, if her other kids start making life difficult for her eldest, it's not going to be long before he can ask for a change in custody or she just walks out and doesn't look back herself. I hate the mentality that people with good parents aren't allowed to be happy/proud of what they have because someone else might be jelly.\n\nTrust me when I say I got the short stick in familial and parental situations. But I never held it against anyone that had it better. I was wistful, sure, but I wouldn't take it out on someone else for having a better home life than me. \n\nFact is, it's on the mom and her new husband/the girls' parents to make them feel happy. To take care of them. And in the grand scheme of abuse and neglect, having to take a bus to school instead of being driven does not even register.", "This isn't a case of parents and steps. OP is not step dad to his daughters siblings. He is nothing to them, and them feeling left out is 100% mom's fault for not establishing a super clear boundary and explaining why this is how it is. You can't be \"left out\" of something there was never any chance you would ever be included in. I'm not \"left out\" when my siblings get dinner with their friends.", "Also a factor to consider in making the decision. Good point. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t so much lose him in the morning though as she has to share him. It would change things. But we don\u2019t know how the relationship is with the siblings, it could be that she\u2019d also enjoy having them along. Prob not though. Just hope OP does whatever he judges best for his daughter. Seems like he wants that.", "I agree,  and I'm not trying to guilt him into anything other than using this to his benefit by getting more time with his daughter. If he doesn't want to,  then he shouldn't.  I never said this guy was YTA, I said it's a tricky situation and to see if he can use it for his benefit", "If he doesn\u2019t drive the other kids home as well that will still breed resentment anyway", "She does lose him, you're suggesting they no longer spend mornings together getting breakfast. Getting breakfast alone together and just getting dropped off at school are wildly different activities and can't really be compared in terms of quality time. There is also no reason to share him."]}
