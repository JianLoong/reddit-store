Now is the perfect time for you to start learning about saving and everything", "Info: what currency is this? If you were talking euros or usd I wouldn\u2019t say YTA for wanting to spend your own money but don\u2019t be dumb and blow over a quarter of your savings on ridiculously expensive pens", "NTA. It's your money, you saved it, and you should be free to spend it however you want. Also,  unless you actually have a high paying job, I don't think parents should be relying on their children for bills.\n\nThat said, I would consider holding off on the purchase because 1) you don't need it (as you said yourself), 2) it's a huge fraction to spend on just a \"want\", and 3) you may need it for an actual emergency (not just family bills). Also, holding off on a purchase and saving more would mean you can get better items in the future.\n\nMaybe find something to motivate you to save, like you can save more in time for the holidays  (if you celebrate holidays).", "Info how old are you?", "Bills and stuff are more important than pens that you don't really need.

You can always buy the pens later when circumstances improve.", "More info needed.  YWNBTA if you do not have an agreement to contribute to hh bills and/or know that those funds could make or break the hh.  If you have agreed to assist or you know that those funds will be needed or your family could be in a financial bind then you would be the AH.  Honestly, more info is needed.", "INFO: are you responsible for paying the bills normally?", "NTA, It\u2018s your money that you saved and if you want to buy something from it than you should, it\u2019s not like you spend your whole money, it\u2019s just one pants that you want.

You still have money left and as you mentioned in the comments you\u00b4re underage so you shouldn\u00b4t be expected to provide for your family financially.
