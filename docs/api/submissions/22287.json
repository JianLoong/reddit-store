It has been a long understood fact in our house that if any of my kids have children young, I'm not going to be there to help them. No passing off the kids to granny, no granny can you babysit, no granny can you pay for this or that. None of it. I preached abstinence (unpopular, I know). My son could have had a great future - very high book IQ (very low life IQ apparently) \u2013 but this happened and now that's all over with. The most help I've given him is discounted rent at our house.\n\nSometimes Selene drops the babies over here when Nikolai isn't working so he can look after them. He basically agreed that whenever she feels tired/overwhelmed she can bring them here and he'll take care of it. It's a bit loud when they're at my house but I wear my noise-cancelling headphones and get on with my day. \n\nDay before yesterday Selene dropped the babies off for the night. After a couple of hours of not being able to get them to sleep my son basically begged me to help him. I told him I'm sorry but I'm not doing it. If I cave in this once, it's going to become a regular thing. He offered to pay me but that boy is barely making ends meet as it is so I refused. I told him to try rocking the cradle with his foot, gave him a hug, and went to bed.\n\nWell, the next day when he gets in from work he's in a terrible mood. I try to ask him how his day went like normal, but he just flashed me a forced smile and went to his room. I know he's upset, he's got two jobs and has to work overtime, but he's just got the face the fact that this is his life now. I've talked to a couple family members about it because I did feel a little guilty, but there's mixed opinions. Some thing I'm being too harsh, others say stick to your guns. AITA for not helping?\n\nEDIT: Since a lot of people are jumping to conclusions over my abstinence comment, let me clarify that yes, I taught safe practices too and put them in education at school. My kids agreed with abstinence as the best method, too.", "created_utc": 1689415353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1507zu9/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_son_with_his_kids_in/", "score": 376, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What would you be doing if your son was 30, married, and had kids? What if he had gone through a divorce and needed to move back home? Would you be holding babies and babysitting on occasion? Would you be buying cute outfits? You're not just making your son suffer. You're damaging any relationship you could ever have with your grandchildren. Regardless of the timeline and how it happened, the babies are here now. There is no reason you can't be the grandma you would have been in a more ideal scenario. And if you want your son and those babies to still have a bright future, you could help more. He's learned his lesson. He's discovered how hard it is. No, you shouldn't be watching the babies so he can go party, but you have the ability to ensure he succeeds in life.", "I\u2019d be interested to know what exactly you believe you are accomplishing by refusing to help the father of your grandchildren? Just punish your son, until when? Until he moves out & never comes near you again. YTA", "So the reason abstinence sex ed is unpopular is because it does not work, as your son and you have found out.  So for me you are the AH right from there as you didn't equip your son to function in the world\n\nYou are being cold hearted - those are your grandchildren. You refer to your own son as 'that boy'\n\nYou've trapped your son and now he's stuck living with an ignorant cold hearted mother \n\nYTA", "YTA.

He made a mistake. \n\n>I know he's upset, he's got two jobs and has to work overtime, but he's just got the face the fact that this is his life now.\n\nHe is not walking away from his responsibilities. The humane, loving thing to do is to give him some respite. \n\nFrankly, you sound like a cruel, judgmental sadist. Sleep deprivation is used as a torture technique. But, hey, as long as you get to rub his face in his mistake. Sadly, if he gets sick or se1fhurts himself you will probably celebrate his pain, because you have zero empathy. \n\nIf you were a better parent you would make sure he still has a path to success. Guide him. Maybe DON'T  charge him rent, help him get an education or training so that he can get a better paying job, find affordable childcare so that he and the mom can still study or work. \n\nThere was another post that was the polar opposite. In that case the young man's dad, grandpa, guided his son in how to be a good parent. He provided a safety net, not an escape route. The young couple, after a few bumps on the way, ended up happily together and their small family thrived. Grandpa was very supportive in a low key way.  I believe the son wrote the post to celebrate his own dad's wise kindness and humanity. I wish I could find and link it. \n\nBut, all of that took intelligence, kindness,  and love on grandpa's part. He didn't just make popcorn and stand by watching the drama.", "Look if you don\u2019t want to be the go to babysitter then fine; it\u2019s true your son got himself into this situation and he needs to be responsible for it. \n\nHowever you also need to realize that mentality of not being involved at all will not be something he forgets \n\nEventually he will stand on his own, and move out to be a man with his children.

Say goodbye to 2 generations of family relationships. \n\nYTA btw", "Of course kids are going to agree with their parents about abstinence. It they don't, they'd probably wind up with tighter restrictions. I mean at first I agreed with my parents about abstinence but then came the pressure (not from him) and then the curiosity and wondering why I believed in abstinence in the first place, then the temptation and I eventually talked myself into it.\n\nIf you're not going to help him then you need to encourage him to find services that will.\n\nYTA", "YTA. I don't even know where to start.

You aren't really teaching him anything by not helping other than he can't count on you. Also, the grandbaby is being punished. If a new parent is at their limit, you help. It takes a village.\n\nStep it up and stop trying to prove a point unless you don't want a relationship with your grandkids and son. Also, what point are you really trying to prove?

It has been a long understood fact in our house that if any of my kids have children young, I'm not going to be there to help them. No passing off the kids to granny, no granny can you babysit, no granny can you pay for this or that. None of it. I preached abstinence (unpopular, I know). My son could have had a great future - very high book IQ (very low life IQ apparently) \u2013 but this happened and now that's all over with. The most help I've given him is discounted rent at our house.\n\nSometimes Selene drops the babies over here when Nikolai isn't working so he can look after them. He basically agreed that whenever she feels tired/overwhelmed she can bring them here and he'll take care of it. It's a bit loud when they're at my house but I wear my noise-cancelling headphones and get on with my day. \n\nDay before yesterday Selene dropped the babies off for the night. After a couple of hours of not being able to get them to sleep my son basically begged me to help him. I told him I'm sorry but I'm not doing it. If I cave in this once, it's going to become a regular thing. He offered to pay me but that boy is barely making ends meet as it is so I refused. I told him to try rocking the cradle with his foot, gave him a hug, and went to bed.\n\nWell, the next day when he gets in from work he's in a terrible mood. I try to ask him how his day went like normal, but he just flashed me a forced smile and went to his room. I know he's upset, he's got two jobs and has to work overtime, but he's just got the face the fact that this is his life now. I've talked to a couple family members about it because I did feel a little guilty, but there's mixed opinions. Some thing I'm being too harsh, others say stick to your guns.

Even with safe sex techniques, oops babies still happen (just of course way less frequently). \n\nThere\u2019s a lot to dislike about OP\u2019s approach with her grandkids, but she didn\u2019t cause this to happen because back in the day she didn\u2019t personally demonstrate condoms on bananas for her kids.", "When you say \"babysit\" do you mean \"babysit\" or do you mean \"daycare\"?\n\nIt absolutely blows my mind if you mean \"babysit\" because that's like 3 hours at most OR having the kid spend a night.\n\nIf you won't BABYSIT your grandkids, you're a fucking awful person \ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019m a 34-year-old mom of two and I think OP is an AH. I think she\u2019s within her rights, but it\u2019s pretty clear she hates her kids and resents having them.

What kind of model is she being for her son?", "One can hope that this is the case, and we won't see OP turning into that type of grandparent who thinks he/she has a \"right\" to the grandkids", "I agree, when you decide to have children, you acknowledge the fact that they could fuck up and you as a parent should be there to guide and help them make it right. OP isn't a good parent, I'm certain that this will eventually come back to bite them in the ass.", "I can always hire a caretaker for my old age. I don't want my kids to spend their golden/silver years trying to help me, I want them to have fun and enjoy themselves. \n\nAs I've stated earlier, one time turns into two times, three times, four... I can appreciate it's not going to be easy, however they are his children. I'm not punishing him, these new responsibilities ARE his punishment.

The gf as well would have known. Gen z are pretty savvy about safe sex and sex education. The thing is, no matter how it happens, babies happen if people have sex even as safely as possible and not everyone can get or handle abortion and there's literally no gain at all for her, delighting in being cruel and giving them LESS help than she would have if they were married first.", "Better hope you don't get infirm when you're older and need your family to help make arrangements for you.

The absolutely blas\u00e9 way OP talks about not caring to have a relationship with her own son and grandchildren is so cold-hearted and messed up that NOT having regrets almost sounds like OP has some severe psychological issues.", "Pfft... I hope she does regret it!", "Right?... and it seems like OP is totally fine with being surrounded by strangers instead of loved ones towards the end of their life. Personally, that sounds sad and miserable.", "She was just begging for a petty echo chamber,  like the AHs usually do in here", "Yeah and they basically said that they would rather be around strangers instead of loved ones towards the end of their life. We'll see how that works out for them, personally that sounds sad and miserable to me."]}
