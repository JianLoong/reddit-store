On a tooth that'll fall out in a few years no less. Not sure how this could be mistaken as \"permanently altering appearance\" any more than getting her stitches if she gets a bad cut could be considered such.\n\nDid you mention the crown to him though? A lot of cavities just need to be scraped out and then filled in, a crown is usually used for more significant cavities.", "NTA \n\nSome people just love to be in control, don't they? When something like this happens, they find a way to pick a fight over something out of their control and have to blame someone and you're it. \n\nYou've explained it twice now. Let him call the dentist and be educated on the difference between fillings and crowns and why a crown has to be placed instead of a filling. This isn't your job, you're not a dentist. Then let it lie. He can't sue you and win over something so stupid.", "NTA. The dentist decided on the best way to fill the cavity at the time. That's very different from choosing to alter her teeth.", "NTA. Necessary dental work is not a material alteration, because it does not permanently alter her appearance. He can, at great expense to him and physical harm to your daughter, have it removed. But let him know that if he does file such a motion, you\u2019d be within your rights to seek attorneys fees and a protective order. (I\u2019m not giving legal advice \u2014 these are known remedies for baseless court proceedings).  \n\nOr, he can be an adult, accept this temporary change, and use it as an opportunity to have an agreement on what materials are permissible for future dental repair. My dentist told me that bonding deteriorates quicker on our rear molars, and can be more expensive.  I ended up selecting a gold cap for my rear molar because I prefer something durable, rather than a material that can easily crack or deteriorate. Plus, I bloody hate going to the dentist! \n\nYour decision was made out of practicality, I\u2019m sure. He\u2019s just going to have to be reasonable, because wasting money and court resources to get his way will not be without consequence. During a recession? Not the time to squander money on stupid shit. Being a reasonable co-parent is just more affordable. Your daughter deserves two adult parents, he must be willing to agree to that.", "NTA.

Your ex is just being dumb..my kid has one cap ona  molar since she was 4. You can't even see it and once it falls out it is gone.

I think not.\n\nYour ex is making a mountain out of a molehill -- or a crown. And in the process he's probably made your daughter self-conscious about something that's really pretty trivial. Ugh.", "NTA. Your daughter needed a medical procedure done; this is more like getting a scar after stitches.

Its also a medical procedure.\n\nIf you want a hearty laugh tell him to take it to family court and watch him explain to a family court judge how getting a crown put on a baby tooth that will fall out in 3-4 years is somehow a permanent alteration.\n\nHe'd find himself laughed out of family court.\n\nHe's making drama for the sake of it. Something tells me that he's the controlling, possessive type and still hasn't learned his lesson.", "NTA. Not cosmetic, not permanent, and you did get his consent.

It will be gone soon enough and unless he wanted to pay extra for the crown to look like her teeth, what were you supposed to do?

Temporary.", "NTA, not because of the reasons you mentioned, but for the simple reason that your dentist did not tell you in detail what the crown would look like. Shame on them. Your ex has no right to blame you for something you knew nothing about.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t permanent. To be fair ear piercing isn\u2019t either.  If he disagrees he can call the dentist and ask if she really needed it I suppose.", "Medical procedure, and also not a permanent change. NTA", "NTA \n\nFirst of all he agreed to the filling and crown. So you\u2019re completely covered \u2014 even if it was a permanent alteration to her appearance, which it\u2019s not. \n\nHowever, learn from this experience. Start communicating through a parenting app. Usually anytime either parent requests this, the courts automatically require it. It will add a layer of protection as your daughter gets older and different issues come up. It also means that if your ex harasses you, there\u2019s documentation. Often people automatically self censure when they know that everything they put in the app can be reviewed by a judge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm terrified of dental work and there was no way in hell I was gonna let this mean ass lady stick a drill in my mouth (she was just a very rude and nasty person every time I saw her.)

The dentist who pulled them specifically told me there was nothing I could have done, they just had to be pulled. (I got the anesthesia and still had a massive panic attack beforehand, to the point of almost passing out.) Anyway my teeth were fine and she just wanted to do an unnecessary procedure on a terrified child for the sake of scamming my mom out of probably thousands of dollars, and she was willing to bully me and my mom to do it.
