On a tooth that'll fall out in a few years no less. Not sure how this could be mistaken as \"permanently altering appearance\" any more than getting her stitches if she gets a bad cut could be considered such.\n\nDid you mention the crown to him though? A lot of cavities just need to be scraped out and then filled in, a crown is usually used for more significant cavities.", "NTA \n\nSome people just love to be in control, don't they? When something like this happens, they find a way to pick a fight over something out of their control and have to blame someone and you're it. \n\nYou've explained it twice now. Let him call the dentist and be educated on the difference between fillings and crowns and why a crown has to be placed instead of a filling. This isn't your job, you're not a dentist. Then let it lie. He can't sue you and win over something so stupid.", "NTA. The dentist decided on the best way to fill the cavity at the time. That's very different from choosing to alter her teeth.", "NTA. Necessary dental work is not a material alteration, because it does not permanently alter her appearance. He can, at great expense to him and physical harm to your daughter, have it removed. But let him know that if he does file such a motion, you\u2019d be within your rights to seek attorneys fees and a protective order. (I\u2019m not giving legal advice \u2014 these are known remedies for baseless court proceedings).  \n\nOr, he can be an adult, accept this temporary change, and use it as an opportunity to have an agreement on what materials are permissible for future dental repair. My dentist told me that bonding deteriorates quicker on our rear molars, and can be more expensive.  I ended up selecting a gold cap for my rear molar because I prefer something durable, rather than a material that can easily crack or deteriorate. Plus, I bloody hate going to the dentist! \n\nYour decision was made out of practicality, I\u2019m sure. He\u2019s just going to have to be reasonable, because wasting money and court resources to get his way will not be without consequence. During a recession? Not the time to squander money on stupid shit. Being a reasonable co-parent is just more affordable. Your daughter deserves two adult parents, he must be willing to agree to that.", "NTA.

Your ex is just being dumb..my kid has one cap ona  molar since she was 4. You can't even see it and once it falls out it is gone.

I think not.\n\nYour ex is making a mountain out of a molehill -- or a crown. And in the process he's probably made your daughter self-conscious about something that's really pretty trivial.

Something tells me that he's the controlling, possessive type and still hasn't learned his lesson.", "NTA. Not cosmetic, not permanent, and you did get his consent.

Temporary.", "NTA, not because of the reasons you mentioned, but for the simple reason that your dentist did not tell you in detail what the crown would look like. Shame on them. Your ex has no right to blame you for something you knew nothing about.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t permanent. To be fair ear piercing isn\u2019t either.  If he disagrees he can call the dentist and ask if she really needed it I suppose.", "Medical procedure, and also not a permanent change. NTA", "NTA \n\nFirst of all he agreed to the filling and crown. So you\u2019re completely covered \u2014 even if it was a permanent alteration to her appearance, which it\u2019s not. \n\nHowever, learn from this experience. Start communicating through a parenting app. Usually anytime either parent requests this, the courts automatically require it. It will add a layer of protection as your daughter gets older and different issues come up. It also means that if your ex harasses you, there\u2019s documentation. Often people automatically self censure when they know that everything they put in the app can be reviewed by a judge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It doesn\u2019t bother your daughter, and apparently, it\u2019s a common procedure today for children of that age. Her present appearance is NOT a permanent change. Not much different from when their baby teeth fall out and they\u2019re toothless until the new teeth start coming in. Every child in the world goes through it.

It would save all this drama", "Yeah it's not permanent so it doesn't violate the terms of the agreement.\n\nFor baby teeth the enamel is thinner so a lot of doctors will opt for a full crown on the whole tooth to encapsulate it and prevent any chance of infection spreading from the now compromised tooth to other areas of the mouth.

I would consider just using that, but I'm honestly pretty vain about my smile.", "They make small premade steel ones. It protects the tooth underneath from kid damage, and is way less traumatizing then drilling. Plus I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s much easier because they have to grind it down while your awake to make sure the tooth feels like it fits right.

Get off the Reddit \ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019m a dentist and there are many instances where a crown is preferred vs just a filling on baby teeth. For starters, these teeth are softer so decay progresses faster, and they are smaller, so the ratio of healthy to unhealthy tooth structure goes down quickly.  Second, if a tooth is severely decayed and then overfilled, the child is more likely to break the tooth and then have to have it extracted early.  Taking a baby tooth out before it falls out can cause a lot of issues with malalignment and can actually end up costing parents A LOT more money for braces in the long run than a pediatric crown.  Lastly, pediatric crowns are usually prefabricated silver crowns that are very different than crowns you would put on adult teeth and much less costly.\n\nAlso, NTA OP.  You were a responsible parent taking your child for a dental visit and getting a silver crown is a big stretch to call \u201cpermanently altered\u201d", "This is a stainless steal crown (pre-fabricated) it is used when the cavity is too large to support a filling.

Seemed to me like it was just easier/quicker/less stress on the kid, and honestly not all that expensive from what I recall.  They're not really crowns like adults, they're just covers they slap on after grinding the tooth down a bit.  Adult crowns they do WAY more to make it a permanent fit", "Decay on baby teeth can affect adult teeth before they even come out. Also to prevent a larger cavity from causing a tooth to break, and fall out before it\u2019s ready to,  sigues need to be taken care of.

Antibiotics are known to affect tooth enamel.", "My brother had some crowns on his baby teeth. His teeth were really bad, the dentist said it was genetic. My dad agreed that was the case as his baby teeth were also riddled with cavities.", "It may depend on the spacing and size of the baby teeth some cavities especially in smaller teeth may be too difficult to put a standard filling in but may make removing the teeth not a great option because the adult teeth could come in wrong or cause overcrowding. I had to have a crown on one of my baby teeth due to crowding (the tooth was too small for a standard filling to work)", "I had like, 4 of those silver crowns as a kid. Its no big deal. Mom just needs to never feed the kid fruit snacks or fruit roll ups again.", "Yeah, I thought that was weird that they were doing a crown on a baby tooth and the other children in the class also have them.

And can even cause issues in some cases.", "It depends on the tooth, sometimes the crowns that look like teeth aren\u2019t appropriate.

I used to work at a pediatric dental office\u2014prefabricated stainless steel crowns are standard treatment for big cavities in baby teeth. Nothing weird or unnecessary.", "Metal crowns are still definitely a thing. \n\nIt's my understanding that they are a cheaper option, and since OP's daughter is six and likely to send that crowned molar off to the tooth fairy in a few years, there's no need to spend \"last a lifetime\" amounts of cash on a tooth whose projected life expectancy is just a little longer than a dwarf hamster's.", "That makes total sense, but it doesn\u2019t sound like OP had that conversation with the dentist or else she would have mentioned it to us and her ex.", "I had mine until my mid 30s lmao.

He's a tween.  I wish I had taken him to a pediatric dentist earlier.  Yes, the staff is much better with kids (the hygienist's cleaning was crazy fast) and the waiting room has an arcade machine.  But they are much more attuned to the growth of kids.\n\nThey told us he needed an orthodontist and gave us a list of suggestions.  There's lots to fix, starting with two permanent teeth that are blocked from their proper spot by extra-stubborn baby teeth and are kind of going sideways.  I believe them--they provided copies of all the pics, x-rays, and medical notes, they're a large and well-regarded practice, and I had been semi-expecting some of the issues.

I somewhat agree but I think having a long term relationship with one dentist is important to establish a good lifelong routine.", "You see this a LOT with Medicaid.
