Last month at her dentist appointment, they told me she has two cavities they have to fix. They did mention one would be a regular filling and one would be a crown. I didn\u2019t think too much of it.  I scheduled the appointment, and texted her father that she had 2 cavities that would be fixed in November. \n\nSo Thursday was the filling/crown. They said everything went great, okie dokie. Later that day I saw the crown for the first time. Her tooth is completely silver (stainless steel). I was surprised but don\u2019t really care because 1- it\u2019s a baby tooth and 2- it\u2019s a bottom side tooth so it\u2019s not too obvious. She thought it was kinda cool and has friends in her class with the same thing. \n\nWell today is the first day my ex has my daughter since the crown. I\u2019m getting yelled at via text because I should have \u201cdiscussed with him\u201d before I did that and I \u201cnever communicated\u201d about it happening. (I happily sent him the screenshot right away where I told him the exact date and time cavities were being fixed.)\n\nHis argument is we have a clause in the divorce we can\u2019t permanently alter her appearance without both parents consent. I had this written in because I didn\u2019t want him deciding to pierce her ears without my consent.

On a tooth that'll fall out in a few years no less. Not sure how this could be mistaken as \"permanently altering appearance\" any more than getting her stitches if she gets a bad cut could be considered such.\n\nDid you mention the crown to him though? A lot of cavities just need to be scraped out and then filled in, a crown is usually used for more significant cavities.", "NTA \n\nSome people just love to be in control, don't they? When something like this happens, they find a way to pick a fight over something out of their control and have to blame someone and you're it. \n\nYou've explained it twice now. Let him call the dentist and be educated on the difference between fillings and crowns and why a crown has to be placed instead of a filling. This isn't your job, you're not a dentist. Then let it lie. He can't sue you and win over something so stupid.", "NTA. The dentist decided on the best way to fill the cavity at the time. That's very different from choosing to alter her teeth.", "NTA. Necessary dental work is not a material alteration, because it does not permanently alter her appearance. He can, at great expense to him and physical harm to your daughter, have it removed. But let him know that if he does file such a motion, you\u2019d be within your rights to seek attorneys fees and a protective order. (I\u2019m not giving legal advice \u2014 these are known remedies for baseless court proceedings).  \n\nOr, he can be an adult, accept this temporary change, and use it as an opportunity to have an agreement on what materials are permissible for future dental repair. My dentist told me that bonding deteriorates quicker on our rear molars, and can be more expensive.  I ended up selecting a gold cap for my rear molar because I prefer something durable, rather than a material that can easily crack or deteriorate. Plus, I bloody hate going to the dentist! \n\nYour decision was made out of practicality, I\u2019m sure. He\u2019s just going to have to be reasonable, because wasting money and court resources to get his way will not be without consequence. During a recession? Not the time to squander money on stupid shit. Being a reasonable co-parent is just more affordable. Your daughter deserves two adult parents, he must be willing to agree to that.", "NTA. A baby tooth is not permanent. Would he prefer she get an infection from the cavity?", "NTA \n\nIf he\u2019s so sure it\u2019s a violation of the provisions of the divorce decree, tell him he\u2019s more than welcome to waste his time & money to get scolded by the judge for wasting the court\u2019s time.", "NTA really it was a medical procedure she needed and he was given the information about it happening. It looks different than he expected that's on him. He could have asked questions before hand but didn't.", "NTA. You let him know it was happening, it\u2019s not permanent, and it was a necessary procedure.", "NTA\n\nIt isn't a permanent alteration since it is a baby tooth.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t permanently alter her appearance. Aside that this was a medically necessary procedure, the tooth will fall out in a few years. By any metric, that is not \u201cpermanent\u201d.", "Its not a permanent alteration if it's a baby tooth. So you're good and also very clearly NTA", "NTA, first of all  it's a mwscial procedure and it's not permanent so he's got no argument there. And second of all they almost always do caps (or Ironman tooth as my kid calls it...) in kids. Once they have their adult teeth it will be filling usually unless the cavity is too big. Your ex is just being dumb..my kid has one cap ona  molar since she was 4. You can't even see it and once it falls out it is gone. I've seen some poor kids with their mouth full of caps and I feel for them but ultimately they will lose them all anyway so no biggie.", "NTA. 1) he was informed, 2) it\u2019s medical, and 3) it\u2019s a baby tooth. It\u2019s not permanent - but tooth decay damage would be :) yanno. If he prefers.", "NTA. Her baby tooth will fall out, it\u2019s not permanent.", "NTA\n\nHow is getting a crown altering her appearance. Is she walking around with her mouth gaping open all the time? I think not.\n\nYour ex is making a mountain out of a molehill -- or a crown. And in the process he's probably made your daughter self-conscious about something that's really pretty trivial. Ugh.", "NTA. Your daughter needed a medical procedure done; this is more like getting a scar after stitches. His argument boils down to him claiming she didn't need the crown in the first place, which is ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nHe was informed. Its also a medical procedure.\n\nIf you want a hearty laugh tell him to take it to family court and watch him explain to a family court judge how getting a crown put on a baby tooth that will fall out in 3-4 years is somehow a permanent alteration.\n\nHe'd find himself laughed out of family court.\n\nHe's making drama for the sake of it. Something tells me that he's the controlling, possessive type and still hasn't learned his lesson.", "NTA. Not cosmetic, not permanent, and you did get his consent. What does it even matter to him?", "NTA. It\u2019s a baby tooth. Not cosmetic, not permanent.", "Altered her appearance permanently??? It\u2019s a baby tooth is he daft?", "NTA. Like others said, it\u2019s a baby tooth and not permanent. Secondly, pretty sure that silver crown is a whole lot cheaper than a white porcelain one he\u2019d likely have to pay you half for.", "NTA: I\u2019d cal your lawyer to give them a heads up about it and make sure you\u2019re in the clear. \n\nIt\u2019s a baby tooth and a medical thing. You didn\u2019t do anything permanent.", "NTA. It's not cosmetic, and it's not permanent.", "NTA. Sounds like the ex is i tryna pick a fight.", "NTA. It\u2019s not a permanent change to her appearance. It\u2019s a baby tooth with will eventually fall out. Hope a judge laughs in his face if he tries to fight it.", "Its not permanent. It'll fall out in a few years. \n\nBoom. Done. \n\nNTA", "NTA and I know everyone\u2019s teeth are different, poor thing is so young to have that done", "NTA, Baby teeth aren\u2019t permanent", " NtA \n\nWhat was his solution? Leave the tooth to rot?", "NTA. I was wondering why it wasn't that ceramic composite, but I guess since it's baby teeth, the metal is cheaper? I doubt any judge would get upset with you.", "It isn't permanent, I've had MANY crowns in my life, when her baby tooth falls out, that crown comes with. They're important to keep the tooth from rotting out and damaging the nerve.", "NTA what a weird thing for you ex to be upset about. I can see why he\u2019s probably your ex", "NTA and it\u2019s not permanent as it will fall out. Don\u2019t fall for your exes drama.", "NTA.  Not permanent.", "Its temporary until the baby tooth falls out. You were being a responsible parent by getting it fixed.", "I hate the silver ones. They look awful to me. But, I get it. It will be gone soon enough and unless he wanted to pay extra for the crown to look like her teeth, what were you supposed to do? (Besides sometimes silver is the best option regardless what it looks like.)\n\nNTA. Its not permanent. The child didn't have rhinoplasty or even get her ears pierced. Baby teeth get replaced with new ones.", "NTA\n\nIt's not a permanent alter because it's not even on permanent teeth.\n\nGeez!", "So what?\n\n\nPermanently alter? It's a baby tooth, it will fall out.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA. My daughter has two silver caps. It's just a simpler, less scary alternative to a filling, especially for a baby tooth. We (and her dentist) call them her \"pretty, princess, sparkle teeth\".", "NTA.  It\u2019s a baby tooth. Temporary.", "NTA, not because of the reasons you mentioned, but for the simple reason that your dentist did not tell you in detail what the crown would look like. Shame on them. Your ex has no right to blame you for something you knew nothing about.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t permanent. To be fair ear piercing isn\u2019t either.  If he disagrees he can call the dentist and ask if she really needed it I suppose.", "Medical procedure, and also not a permanent change. NTA", "NTA \n\nFirst of all he agreed to the filling and crown. So you\u2019re completely covered \u2014 even if it was a permanent alteration to her appearance, which it\u2019s not. \n\nHowever, learn from this experience. Start communicating through a parenting app. Usually anytime either parent requests this, the courts automatically require it. It will add a layer of protection as your daughter gets older and different issues come up. It also means that if your ex harasses you, there\u2019s documentation. Often people automatically self censure when they know that everything they put in the app can be reviewed by a judge.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Does your daughter regularly brush her teeth?  Do you take her to a chain dental place (like Aspen Dental) and/or use Medicaid to pay?", "NTA about the tooth but this is clearly revenge for you requesting the clause in the first place. If you were an AH about it the clause expect to reap what you sow. Dudes been looking for this opportunity for 4 years.", "INFO: Wait I'm confused; how did you not know that a crown would be silver? Did you tune out while the dentist was explaining the procedure or something?\n\nI think your ex has a fair complaint, though perhaps its not being worded correctly - he was not given all important and relevant information about a medical procedure you had arranged for his daughter, and therefore he was prevented from being able to make an informed decision about it. You didn't tell him what the procedure would be or the outcome to expect.\n\nI understand you're saying that you didn't realise this would be the outcome either - but its something you had discussed and arranged.
