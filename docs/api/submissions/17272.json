I told her sure, she could hang out with my girlfriend (31F) and I for that time. We picked her up Friday afternoon.\n\nWell that week we also found out about some local bands that we like who were playing a show Friday night, so my girlfriend and I decided we could actually just go with my niece because it was all ages and some people take their kids to shows. We asked her if she wanted to see some music and she was thrilled and said yes. So we took her, she thought it was funny she had X's drawn on the back of her hands, and we enjoyed the show. We never let her out of my sight and whenever I went into a mosh pit my girlfriend would just hold my niece in the back because she doesn't usually like moshing, we gave her plenty of water and my girlfriend took her to the bathroom when she wanted to. Afterwards she told us the bands were cool and she liked the crazy dancing but she was tired (unsurprisingly) so we took her home and she went right asleep.\n\nWell then my sister picked her up Saturday night. Today we met up and went out to see our mom for Mother's Day. While our mom had her daughter my sister pulled me off to the side and asked me what happened, because she asked her daughter about the X's on her hands, and she said she got to see some \"shouty bands\" (which I thought was funny because they weren't even really that heavy, just some emoish post-hardcore with a little moshy parts at times) and that when she grew up she wanted to be a singer just like \"screaming lady\" obviously referring to one of the band's vocalists (which is funny too because only like 20% of her vocals are screaming), and how the crazy people were \"running into each other\" and \"pushing around\". I said that yes we took her to the show because we weren't missing it, my sister got upset, I pointed out that her daughter enjoyed it, we didn't even charge my sister for her ticket, and we kept her safe the whole time. All we did was have fun with her daughter and she definitely appreciated it, so I don't see the problem. So am I an asshole?", "created_utc": 1684124101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hx96e/aita_for_taking_my_niece_to_a_posthardcore_show/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The expectation was that you were to watch her daughter who is only six so she could take care of whatever was going on.   Then you took it upon yourself to bring the 6 year old to an event (a post hardcore show lol) without clearing it with her mom (that is the big issue).\n\nI have a 6 year old son (single dad full custody).  I would not have been thrilled at all and it would be awhile before I trusted you with the kiddo again.  You don't get to make those decisions as you are not the parent.   Chalk it up to not having kids.", "YTA. \n\nThis is one of those things where you absolutely need the permission of the parent before taking the child. You didn't take her to see Disney on Ice. You took her to an event mostly for adults with a mosh pit and loud music. Did she have on protective ear covers at least?", "YTA for a multitude of reasons, none of which are related to the music genre.\n\nI'm just assuming these were bands singing lovely songs, never swearing, while everyone in the audience was sober, no one smoked marijuana of any kind in the venue, and no alcohol was served in this venue and going off the best case scenario.\n\nFirstly, you didn't ask her parents permission before bringing her to a live show.\n\nSecondly, you didn't provide hearing protection for **a six year old** at a live show\n\nThirdly:\n\n> We *never let her out of* **my** *sight* and *whenever* **I** *went into a mosh pit* my girlfriend would just hold my niece in the back\n\nIf at some point in the future my sister has a 6 year old and she lets me bring it to a show. I am not leaving her child with my fucking wife so I can go jump into a mosh pit. That child will be with me the entire time, off in the back of the venue, on my shoulders, away from the speakers. I would never leave their side for even a second, if they need to use a toilet, I'm going with them, if I need to use the toilet, they're coming with me. It's a loud, dark, noisy environment with people generally standing shoulder to shoulder as they try and get as close to the stage as possible with a small clearing for the mosh pit. Not an ideal environment to step away from a child even with another adult you trust.", "Yta", "YTA, i absolutely love hardcore shows and i\u2019ve been in my local scene since i was 16, but you are seriously irresponsible to bring a 6 y/o to a show without their parents permission. If ANYTHING happened(even something completely out of your control) most parents would charge you with child endangerment.", "INFO - how late were you out, and did you even have a carseat for her?", "It\u2019s an asshole move to take kids to events while you\u2019re babysitting without even letter a parent know, so YTA. Not even mentioning the fact that illness exposure and hearing damage are more than likely", "YTA - I've been to many a metal gig where there's been young kids present.  They have, however, had over the head ear defenders on, not the shitty free or cheap ear plugs from the venue.  \n\nYou had another person's child in your care and although it worked out okay with them enjoying it, you should have asked the parents permission to take them.  \n\n>I said that yes we took her to the show because we weren't missing it\n\n>we didn't even charge my sister for her ticket\n\nThese 2 lines make you a massive AH.  You made a prior commitment to babysit your niece, that should have been your priority.  Of course you didn't change her for the ticket.  You wanted to go to the gig after you'd made a commitment to her, taking her daughter to a gig without her consent isn't you doing her a favour.  It's you being selfish.", "YTA. You said you would watch your niece, which I'm sure meant that your sister had certain assumptions and expectations about what that would entail. You then went on to alter your plans without telling her, taking her kid somewhere without her permission, and possibly exposed your niece to music your sister wouldn't approve of. You then didn't tell her after the fact, and only told her when you were found out. You took her kid to a venue full of strangers, where she easily could have been harmed or lost (or worse), and didn't even have the consideration to tell her about it? Just because it says \"all ages\" doesn't mean it's appropriate for young children. You were being immensely selfish and could have easily put her in danger just because you didn't want to miss the event. Your sister is right to be mad at you. I wouldn't let you watch my kid again if I were her, but hey, maybe that's a plus for you, so you don't have to risk missing any shows.", "I cannot believe there are people this dense, who cannot possibly see how they messed up. \n\nYou actually had to come here and make this post? I'm legitimately flabbergasted, and I don't think I've ever used that word in any other context \n\nYTA, lol", "YTA.\n\nIf you\u2019re not going to miss the show, then don\u2019t agree to babysit. \n\nSafe is not the same as within sister\u2019s boundaries as a parent. \n\nYour niece would also be safe at an R rated movie. Your sister might not be cool with that. \n\nI\u2019m assuming it\u2019s past your nieces bedtime. Routine is often very important to kids. But this is a guess because it\u2019s not clear.", "YTA - I feel like taking a 6yr old to a mosh pit is something you should probably run past the parents first", "YTA - yeah; I\u2019m super chill about these kinds of things and was actually like 100% with you until I saw the kids age - I was picturing making your argument for a teenaged kid in your care \u2026but 6? You really should have checked with the parents first; it\u2019s common sense to realize that even if you are totally progressive/chill/whatever with these kinds of things, most other people aren\u2019t and this particular \u201cscene\u201d isn\u2019t for everyone, and at that young of an age, it\u2019s only the parents opinion that matters.", "YTA", "Gonna go against the grain and say NTA. The child was supervised, it was an all ages show, she was looked after and had fun. I feel like the issue here is that it was in an environment that people assume is somehow unsafe because of the genre of music. As an old punk/metal lady, I\u2019d feel comfier taking a kid to hang out at most all ages metal shows than a more \u2018socially acceptable\u2019 gig where there seems to be way less of a caring etiquette.", "Yta", "YTA. She's 6, that means her parents have a right to know where she is and what's she doing. They also have a right to give or withdraw consent. You have no right to put her child into that environment without checking it's okay!", "YTA\n\nYou took a SIX YEAR OLD to that kind of gig?! Are you insane?!\n\nINFO: Did you make your niece wear ear plugs? If not, that's horrendous. I know multiple people who have permanent hearing damage from going to gigs like this without wearing ear plugs.", "YTA. I'm not against taking kids to heavy shows or anything and it's a cool experience, but it makes you the asshole for not asking your sister beforehand. You kept her safe and everything, but it's an event that a parent might have some concerns about and therefore would be worth discussing with beforehand rather than deciding you don't want to miss the show despite babysitting so you might as well take her without saying anything to your sister.", "YTA\nI would absolutely take my own kid, but never someone else's *without permission* to a gig like that. YTA for not asking her mother, nothing to do with the venue nor genre of music.", "Minorly YTA because she\u2019s 6 - you should have told her mother your plans. Also she should wear ear protection to a concert.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t take someone else\u2019s\u2019 kids anywhere without parents\u2019 permission.", "YTA- c\u2019mon\u2026.did you really think there wasn\u2019t a possibility that she wouldn\u2019t be cool with this? I have my fun at Rammstein and GWAR shows but most parents who are not heavy into that scene would find the environment objectionable for children and whining about how you feel the genre is being discriminated against doesn\u2019t make you the victim.\n\nThe fact is you made a parenting choice not just with exposure to an environment but behavior and late hours. You avoided telling her for a reason.", "If you thought there was nothing wrong with what you were doing, why didn\u2019t you call your sister and ask her for permission to take her daughter to the show? I think you knew she wouldn\u2019t like it, and didn\u2019t tell her because you didn\u2019t want her to say no, so you could pretend you thought it was OK with her. YTA.", "NTA. Shit can go down anywhere. It was an all ages show. You covered any potential concerns; ear gear, not getting lost/caught in the crowd, a trustworthy women to take her to the restroom. I don't think 10pm is too late for a 6 year, especially not knowing her daily routine. You were a great brother/uncle. Helped your sister out in a time of need and gave your neice an awesome core memory.\nFor everyone saying the mother should have known. She had an emergency situation. Obviously didn't have time to be updated everytime they did something. IE: we're headed to the park, we're headed to dinner, we're headed to the skate park/rink, we're headed to the movies, we're headed to a local all ages show. Unless specifically stated by the sister/mom, I would never assume I'd have to update that info.", "Im gonna lean towards NTA.\n\nThe kid had a great time, didn't get hurt and will have awesome memories of hanging out with OP. People assuming that the environment was dangerous just because there was a mosh pit seems kinda silly to me. The kid might of gotten an experiance that she might not of ever had the chance otherwise.", "NTA\nIt was an all ages show. She had a blast. Kids should do fun unusual things with their aunts and uncles.\n\nIt is cultural exposure. I would be delighted if a relative took my kid to a concert. It certainly isn\u2019t the sort of concert I would take my kid to, so it would be good for someone else to take them.", "Info: did she have earplugs/ear defenders? If not then YTA, if so then NTA.\n\nI've been to plenty to gigs and festivals where kids were present. You kept her away from the mosh pit and she had fun, seems OK to me. The thing I really want to know though, is who were the bands? (I love post-hardcore \ud83d\ude01).", "I see youngins at shoes like this all the time and I LOVEit. Gonna go with NTA. However she (mom) should have been made aware of it", "Honestly, it was an all ages show, so NTA. \n\nYou found her earplugs, you kept her safe, and you took a step towards teaching her that things that are weird and different can be fun, not scary. \n\nI can fully see why sis would be pissed, but it really isn\u2019t any more dangerous than taking her to see a movie. \n\nAnd this is from someone who usually hates being where kids are but loves live shows.", "YTA but just barely. I too would have taken a 6 yr old to a show. Heck, my nephew was performing in them by the time he was 10. The difference is I would have asked before taking someone else's child to something like that, and if they said no, then we wouldn't go. My guess is that you kind of knew your sister would say no, so you chose to not ask. Sort of that old adage of \"better to ask for forgiveness, than permission.\" Unfortunately, that would also make you the AH.  \n\n\nI would, however, recommend you get the kid all the albums you can, including the screaming lady's album-- and a mess of t-shirts of the bands as well.", "NTA. She was safe. This is fine.", "NTA in my opinion, but I take my kids to multi day music festivals\u2026", "NTA", "NTA. You took her to a concert and gave her a great time in an emergency situation when your sister needed help. Plus, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you didn't take her to see bands whose songs are PG-13 and full of violence. You'd think in the US day and age, people would listen to this style of music and find that half of them are age appropriate. Just not country or rap. Hell, there are heavy metal Christian rock bands that folks say is the devil's music but yet their songs are praising the Christian God. \ud83d\ude44 Seems like bias ignorance because God forbid heavy metal, screaming or even rap is all devil's music \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you have that kid and experience of a lifetime she will never forget and she got to do it with her uncle.

Y'all treated her like she was your kid.", "xD never to young for hard n heavy. aslong as she was safe NTA. metal concerts are usually relativly \"human friendly\" like the watch out for each other, even in the mosh pits", "NTA- first, it was an all-ages show. That kind of a show is, by it's nature, suitable for ALL AGES. Your niece had 2 responsible people with her, she had a great time, and it gave her an experience that not many people her age have had. People take their kids to movies that are absolutely inappropriate for their age all of the time and nobody says anything.", "NTA\n\nshe was safe, not in the pit, had ear protection (maybe in vest in some kid headphones though, those are better), kid wasn't scared. \n\nhow is this different from the hippie kids at the outdoor music festivals that's in the hulahoop circle and around all the pot smoke?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But I agree, as someone who loves metal and post-hardcore, it's definitely possible for kids to be there safely, but not without the permission of the parent(s). It's loud, it's very crowded, the mosh pit can sometimes move around and you can get caught up in it, crowdsurfers can hurt you, etc. I got kicked in the jaw five minutes into a post-hardcore show and I was nowhere near the mosh pit lol it's just something that can happen sometimes.

I was at an industrial show in NYC standing by the stage shortly after the doors opened, and this couple came in with maybe a 4 or 5 year old child standing right next to me. My first thought was \"Why the fuck would you bring a child that to a show like this\", not because I think someone will actively hurt the child and you can't trust the kind of people that listen to this music, but this place is serving alcohol, people are in the crowd smoking weed, and the whole venue is going to get very crowded and extremely noisy, especially directly in front of the stage.\n\nOne of the stage hands saw the couple and advised them that maybe standing by the stage wasn't the best spot for a child and told them to view the show from the mezzanine instead. They moved and probably had a decent time at the show, but as much as I love going to live shows I wouldn't bring a 6 year old to a general admission show with standing room only. Too many people walking around not paying attention to where they're walking or who they're shoving.

Yes, I\u2019ve seen drunk people fight at a gig. And a street party, and a wedding. Is your argument that kids shouldn\u2019t be where alcohol is? Ok, no weddings, family gatherings, bbq\u2019s etc. I used to be a paramedic and I\u2019ve treated as many booze related fights at a family wedding as I have at gigs, and hardly any of those were all ages gigs.
