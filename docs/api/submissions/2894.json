People shouldn't be pigeonholed into only wearing clothes and jewelry their ethnicity invented first, otherwise Asians wouldn't get  to wear pants, and other scenarios like that.

That's capitalism.", "NTA, there's a difference between appropriation and appreciation. Also you are giving money to an indigenous craftsperson.

It's one dollar going straight into the pockets of someone practicing a traditional art that was endangered for centuries. And wearing them and telling people about the person who made them is free advertising, which continues the cycle of what was mentioned above. There is no downside to wearing these earrings other than pissing off the occasional virtue signaler.NTA", "NTA..you bought them from an \nIndigenous business. They were produced for people to wear.

It always amazes me that the people most offended and shouting cultural appropriation are rarely from the group they're protecting.  You bought them from an indigenous owned store. If they thought it was inappropriate for people from other cultures to wear their items they wouldn't sell them. \n\n I know a couple of indigenous people and native alaskans.

It means the world to us when the craft can be shared to everyone! In fact it\u2019s great that you went out and supported an indigenous beader! You are NTA at all!! I sell my work at markets all the time to everybody regardless of race or gender, all that matters is I can practice my craft and share it with the community!

Your not wearing a headdress or anything else that is actually culturally significant or important, it\u2019s earrings that were made and sold for enjoyment. Your ok.", "NTA.

You\u2019re helping our indigenous ppl when you purchase handmade and traditional items. Jewelry were items gifted or used as payment.

Yes. Indigenous here. Plains Cree, where we make a ton of beaded earrings. You're fully allowed to wear them. Beading isn't even exclusive to us we're just really good at it.

I don't pretend these things make me Colombian and I am not trying to commandeer their culture to make myself more interesting.  A lot of the stuff is very good looking or really comfortable so I wear it when I feel like it.   \n\nTo me, appropriation occurs when you try to take something for yourself without paying respect to where it comes from.  The Kardashians are really bad for this with African American culture.  \n\nSo NTA for wearing Native American earrings that were for sale in a shop, but I will say it might not hurt to educate yourself on the specific beadwork they're designed from.  That would truly point it towards appreciation and you would learn something cool.", "NTA Plenty of people of various ethnicities wear clothing and accessories from other cultures because they like and appreciate the items.
