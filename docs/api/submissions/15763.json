Your GF has every right to be upset by not getting to go, especially since you've been together a not-insubstantial about of time, but it doesn't give her a right to an invitation. You want to be there for your family, so you should be.

You went out on a limb texting him to ask if she could come, he did not say yes, therefore the rule still applies. Your girlfriend should appreciate that you asked for an exception to be made for her, and she has every right to be disappointed that she couldn't go, but she shouldn't be mad that you went to a wedding for a family member.", "NTA and I think your girlfriend is a bit dramatic and controlling to suggest that if she can't go then you shouldn't either.

It's not uncommon for couples to only invite married people as a couple.  There are usually limitations to the venue size,  the wedding budget' and the couple's patience and energy levels that necessitate setting rules to who gets an invite.  Another common one is \"no kids\" or \"no relatives more distant than first cousin. \" I think that it's unreasonable for girlfriend to expect you not to go since it wasn't necessarily a slight against her in particular;  would she have responded this way if the cousin weren't famous?", "NTA..

She also may be hurt by your decision of going and she can consider this as unsupportive, a lack of commitment to your relationship.

It would be different if some people were allowed to bring girlfriends and others were not  but they are being consistent with the \"rule\" and it's their wedding.

Still, it's a special situation with the fame aspect. I think it's kind of lame that the cousin didn't respond to the text, even negatively.
