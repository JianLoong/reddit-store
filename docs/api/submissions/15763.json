It makes sense if someone is married to invite the spouse, but including a GF/BF is not required, it's nice to allow for a +1 in the instance of non-marrieds.....but it is your cousin's wedding after all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow doesn't mean your GF couldn't have gone and done something else during the wedding and reception, unless it was a destination wedding where they rent a castle or something for everyone to stay at. But again, the discretion of the wedding couple.", "NTA. Famous or not your cousin has every right to police the people coming to their wedding. Your GF has every right to be upset by not getting to go, especially since you've been together a not-insubstantial about of time, but it doesn't give her a right to an invitation. You want to be there for your family, so you should be. If she can't get past that, I'd consider it a very large, very red flag.", "NTA.\n\nGirlfriend has a right to be disappointed, but asking you not to go is an asshole thing to do.", "NTA.\n\n**Never allow a partner to hold you hostage emotionally from celebrating milestones with family, ever.**\n\nYour girlfriend expecting you to miss out on a family wedding is total AH behavior. The rules were set, they\u2019re not the most inclusive but it\u2019s your cousin and their partner\u2019s big day. If your partner doesn\u2019t like it, she can cry a river or dump you.", "NTA - Your cousin set the rules for his wedding, spouses only no girlfriends. You went out on a limb texting him to ask if she could come, he did not say yes, therefore the rule still applies. Your girlfriend should appreciate that you asked for an exception to be made for her, and she has every right to be disappointed that she couldn't go, but she shouldn't be mad that you went to a wedding for a family member.", "NTA and I think your girlfriend is a bit dramatic and controlling to suggest that if she can't go then you shouldn't either. Wow. This is a family event, and family clearly trumps girlfriends/boyfriends. That she doesn't seem to understand that is a little red-flaggy.\n\nHope you had a great time. :)", "Nta.   \n\nYou two are not joining at the hip. Neither of you will die if you two are separated for more than an hour.  \n\nGo enjoy your family.", "NTA \nYou good man, you may be serious about this girl but she is still just a girlfriend. Family comes first.", "NTA. Good reason for a low key wedding, and there was no reason for you not to be there.", "NTA - your cousin specified clearly that \u201cno girlfriends/boyfriends allowed.\u201d If your cousin wanted your girlfriend there he would have invited her.", "NTA\n\nWedding are expensive, and each guest is an extra cost. The couple choose who they want at their wedding.\n\nIf they don't know your girlfriend well, they dont know that she won't post about the wedding without their permission.\n\nYou may have been together for 2 years, but she's not family yet. Your cousin made it clear that this is a family-only event.", "NTA - your cousin\u2019s rules are reasonable, and they apply to everyone. It\u2019s not personal. Your girlfriend isn\u2019t the only significant other excluded. I\u2019d be thinking about things very carefully if my significant other asked me to sit out a family event, when they aren\u2019t even a part of the family yet. You aren\u2019t engaged, right?", "Go and enjoy as much as you want. If she resents you for this, she is not the one. NTA at all.", "NTA.  Your GF is taking a reasonable, blanket rule too personally.  If only she had not been invited, I can see where she might ask you not to go as a show of support for her.  But this isn't the case.  I suspect she might be pulling this to see if your threatened absence results in an invite for her after all.  Don't count on it.\n\nGo and have fun!", "NTA.  I understand that it's disappointing for her to not be able to go, but it's also unfair of her to expect you to miss your cousin's wedding just because she can't go.  Go to your cousin's wedding, enjoy the time with your family, and hopefully she can be an adult about it and understand that it's unreasonable for her to expect you to disappoint your cousin and the rest of your family because she thinks that because she can't go, you shouldn't be able to go either.", "NTA, GF is an AH for trying to keep you from going.", "NTA, it wasn't your rule, it was your cousin's (also his wedding, his rules, no issue there). Your gf should consider if roles were reversed, wouldn't she have done the same and gone without you? If she tries to say no I call bs as anyone would support their family.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA she should have accepted she wasn\u2019t invited.", "NTA. It is out of line her asking you not to go out of spite. Your cousin has a right to privacy and a right to limit who can/cannot go to their wedding.", "NTA.\nYour cousins wedding, his rules. GF should have been supportive that you could attend a cool event and have fun.", "Not at all OP, go to the wedding and enjoy yourself.   She's your girlfriend not your prison guard.   That's crazy, she's just feeling left out and a little jealous which is natural but she shouldn't be asking you not to go to your family's wedding.\n\nEdit to add NTA", "I hate this rule. My cousin is getting married this summer to his partner of 2 years. I\u2019ve been with my partner for 4. Why is our relationship any less valid because we aren\u2019t married? We\u2019ve been together twice as long.", "NTA. Your girlfriend wasnt specifically not invited, it was a hard and fast rule for the whole wedding. You heard her, you tried to ask and your cousin did not want to make exceptions. \n\nAlthough I understand being disappointed about not being able to come, it is a family wedding and asking you not to go seems unreasonable to me.", "NTA. It's not uncommon for couples to only invite married people as a couple.  There are usually limitations to the venue size,  the wedding budget' and the couple's patience and energy levels that necessitate setting rules to who gets an invite.  Another common one is \"no kids\" or \"no relatives more distant than first cousin. \" I think that it's unreasonable for girlfriend to expect you not to go since it wasn't necessarily a slight against her in particular;  would she have responded this way if the cousin weren't famous?", "NTA.. Also doing porn is something we all know about ..", "NTA.. Also doing porn is something we  all know about ..", "NTA", "NTA. Don\u2019t let her drive a wedge between you and your family over her not getting special treatment.", "NTA but you probably could have tried a little bit harder than sending a single text. I would have probably at least tried to have a conversation with him to see how firm he was on the rule given that you've been together for 2 years and this isn't just some date for the wedding.", "NAH I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to go to a family wedding. I can also understand why your gf would be upset. It\u2019s a no win situation.", "NAH. \n\nYour cousin is not an asshole for limiting the attendance of the wedding by not allowing unmarried partners to attend.\n\nYour girlfriend is NTA for asking you if she could attend, or if you would consider missing it.\n\nAnd you're NTA for wanting to go. YWNBTA for going, and you should attend the wedding.", "ESH. I see your girlfriend's point and your cousin is a bit of an asshole for married couples only. Some people live like a married couple (house, kids, etc) but never actually got married. They are disrespecting those relationships.", "For once, I'm going against the grain and go with YTA, but a soft one. I get everyone's point, they 've got all valid reasons. But consider this. Past the 2 years mark, she's not a girlfriend, she's a significant other. She also may be hurt by your decision of going and she can consider this as unsupportive, a lack of commitment to your relationship. I Wish you no ill, but I'll end with a not of caution about the ramifications and consequences about your own relationship with your girlfriend.", "NTA but your cousin seems like a groomzilla.", "NTA  and if your girlfriend persists I'd consider that a HUGE red flag.   It would be different if some people were allowed to bring girlfriends and others were not  but they are being consistent with the \"rule\" and it's their wedding.  Love is about wanting the best for the other person.  Infatuation is about wanted the best for yourself with no consideration for the other person.  The question is does your girlfriend actually love you or is it more of an infatuation?", "NTA.  Go to the wedding.. she is TA for asking you not to go.  It's out of jealous and not nice", "NTA your gf was in fact rather pushy about this. =\\\\", "NTA unless you are joined at the hip you don't have to go everywhere together as a couple all the time.  \n\n\nThis is a family event, the rule is clear (and makes sense to me), and your gf should be happy you get to go and celebrate your cousin. I get that she really wants to go but we don't always get what we want.", "As long as you are okay with her breaking up with you.
