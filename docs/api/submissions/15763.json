Your GF has every right to be upset by not getting to go, especially since you've been together a not-insubstantial about of time, but it doesn't give her a right to an invitation. You want to be there for your family, so you should be.

You went out on a limb texting him to ask if she could come, he did not say yes, therefore the rule still applies. Your girlfriend should appreciate that you asked for an exception to be made for her, and she has every right to be disappointed that she couldn't go, but she shouldn't be mad that you went to a wedding for a family member.", "NTA and I think your girlfriend is a bit dramatic and controlling to suggest that if she can't go then you shouldn't either.

It's not uncommon for couples to only invite married people as a couple.  There are usually limitations to the venue size,  the wedding budget' and the couple's patience and energy levels that necessitate setting rules to who gets an invite.  Another common one is \"no kids\" or \"no relatives more distant than first cousin. \" I think that it's unreasonable for girlfriend to expect you not to go since it wasn't necessarily a slight against her in particular;  would she have responded this way if the cousin weren't famous?", "NTA..

She also may be hurt by your decision of going and she can consider this as unsupportive, a lack of commitment to your relationship.

It would be different if some people were allowed to bring girlfriends and others were not  but they are being consistent with the \"rule\" and it's their wedding.

Still, it's a special situation with the fame aspect. I think it's kind of lame that the cousin didn't respond to the text, even negatively.

Just go over and look at their marriage certificate.", "Have that standard. That\u2019s fine. But also recognize that a non married SO doesn\u2019t get invited when there\u2019s a clear rule.", "No, but I expect to be 100 percent committed and on the same page or working towards being on the same page. I don\u2019t choose to share years of my life with people who don\u2019t want the same bond", "Ok, so you can only go to events your SO is invited to? Regardless of circumstances?", "Would she not do that if they were married?", "Yeah people in the public eye often have so little privacy that I fully support this choice. Most recently Taylor Swift broke up with her boyfriend and even though the rest of the relationship wasn't in the public eye all that much it's now common knowledge what house she was looking at, let people have something to themselves.", "You can have the invites include an NDA with the RSVP. Family is no more/less likely to post pics than anyone else.", "I do recognize that, and ultimately, I would decline if my SO wasn\u2019t invited and I\u2019d expect them to do the same.", "It\u2019s an ongoing conversation based on how things are going. I\u2019m very open and honest when I feel my feelings shift, but nobody who I have been with for even like\u2026 let\u2019s say 6 months, would be surprised by this statement. Generally though, I am 100 percent open about what I\u2019m looking for and things of that nature before even meeting up from a first date. \n\nFeelings are constantly changing, but I will constantly communicate where I\u2019m at, and if the person isn\u2019t on board, or feels differently, we can talk through it and decide how to move forward, even if that is separately", "Probably, but it does help to contain it a little bit of you don't have every cousins' partner there.", "Yes, she could, but marriage is a formality that affords leeway. You don\u2019t need to like family to include them, usually, and there\u2019s less risk of a wife going off the rails like that, as opposed to a girlfriend who are a dime a dozen. \n\nA girlfriend would totally care more about celeb-chasing clout than their boyfriend, a wife probably doesn\u2019t care more for it than her marriage though. Plus a wife would presumably have been around the \u201cceleb\u201d before, at their own wedding, so the excitement has worn off.", "you\u2019re right. this is a small window into their relationship and it was unfair of me to assume the worst. i\u2019ve been in the kind of relationship i was projecting onto the OP\u2019s. i\u2019m sensitive to people who want to control everything you do, but again, you\u2019re right this isn\u2019t necessarily that.\n\ni will say, i spent 3 years in the relationship i\u2019m referring to. i let them control my life for that long. they tried to isolate me from my family and friends and almost succeeded. i would\u2019ve been better off if i\u2019d taken the red flags for what they were instead of making excuses. i should have broken up with them at the first sign and it would have saved me a lot of trauma.\n\nside note, i am in a perfect relationship. when we disagree which isn\u2019t often, we talk instead of get angry, and neither of us has ever tried to control what the other does in literally any way. it\u2019s a toxic thing to do regardless. we\u2019re getting married in june", "she has no right to be upset for what someone decides to do for their own wedding. she\u2019s not entitled to making the rules and guidelines for someone else\u2019s big day. abuser? maybe not, i got worked up and made assumptions i shouldn\u2019t have based on info i don\u2019t have access to. entitled though? absolutely", "Obviously cousin didn't offer that as an option, even when getting a text begging for a +1", "Actually that\u2019s an interesting idea!", "Yes it's OK. It's a party not a right .", "Hahah fair", "it\u2019s absolutely understandable for someone to be disappointed about not getting to go to a wedding. but if op is here asking whether they\u2019re an asshole, i would have to assume that it\u2019s because their partner is making them feel like one, which is not okay. it wasn\u2019t op\u2019s choice for their cousin to make the wedding this way, op\u2019s cousin has every right to do it the way they want, and op has every right to go to their cousin\u2019s wedding. family comes before any person who makes me feel like an asshole for going to a my cousin\u2019s wedding"]}
