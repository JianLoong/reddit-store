She asked what was so wrong about what she offered, given she only had a little bit of money until her next paycheck. \nI responded saying whenever I buy her food I try to make sure it\u2019s a full meal, same rule applies for her when I cook. I said I would have preferred she just get her own food and I would have figured it out myself. \nShe responded saying she couldn\u2019t believe I would feel insulted over her gesture and started crying, saying she grew up poor and sometimes her family had no choice but to share small amounts like that.\nI responded saying we\u2019re not in the same situation and food isn\u2019t scarce, and once again that wasn\u2019t enough food, it was the left over scraps of her meal. \nShe called me uptight and insensitive and I\u2019m now receiving the silent treatment. \nAITA?\n\nETA: to answer some questions coming up a few times: \nI believe she only ordered herself fries and onion rings, while I can\u2019t know for sure because that\u2019s all that was left in the bag when I got home, it\u2019s not out of the ordinary for her to only eat some sides sometimes. \n\nWe\u2019ve been living together for 2 years.

Especially as you didn\u2019t even eat them together. But if she did grow up with food insecurity it makes sense that she might still have warped ideas about portion sizes etc. \n\nI think both of you have been harsher with each other than this situation really called for.

Hopefully the situation will calm down and you two can talk it out. \nIf its an otherwise happy relationship it would be a shame to ruin it over onion rings!", "YTA\n\nShe thought she was being nice.

I understand it wasn't enough food, but you  need to soften your approach and consider her feelings in your response. After all, she didn't leave you that food because she was angry; she thought she was being nice. You could have said, \"Thank you for sharing your dinner with me. That was really sweet. But honey, I eat more than you do, so I'm gonna make something else to go with this. Do you want some, too?\" Then you've acknowledged that she was doing something nice for you and let opened the conversation about differences in your needs for food. \n\nMaybe take a look at The Four Agreements by Miguel Ruiz, a way of checking your self-limiting thoughts and ultimately leading a more open, satisfying, and happy life. \n\n1.

If we're talking a smaller, like McDonalds' large size - that's still enough calories for a modest meal.\n\nHumans do not need *that* much fucking food. Your stomach is the size of your fist. You're gonna be okay if you only eat chips or onion rings for one single meal ffs.", "Honestly I feel like you could be right.", "The silent treatment sure is a favorite method, isn't it?

That comes across as overly dramatic especially considering she thought she was helping him. He could\u2019ve thanked her for the gesture, then told her that needs a little more food so he\u2019s going to make some.", "That just makes them an asshole by telling OP don't worry about dinner and then just eating all the food.", "Fair enough I guess", "I don\u2019t know why this is downvoted - it seems likely and does fit what we know.  The over-reaction when OP called her on it could be guilt, even body issues related to eating two meals", "Sure, but it directly goes against the idea that she gave OP \"scraps \"", "I was assuming an income disparity of sorts. Even so...don't offer a meal to someone if you can't afford it or don't plan to actually...give them a meal.", "Yes I agree it isnt a meal or what he would expect but scraps, someone's trash, or a handful of fries and three onion rings is not the same as saying she saved half the food she ordered, and describing it that way makes it sound a lot more intentional than I think is warranted.", "Most of the time if I express being insulted or hurt to some degree, I've walked away feeling like I should have never said anything to begin with. The arguments that follow are always pretty extreme, to the point I've gotten pretty nasty and toxic myself - which makes me feel ashamed and like I'm the problem. I feel I can be insensitive or harsh when I try to communicate, and I keep thinking maybe I just need to do more work to fix it. \n\nI never really focus on being mistreated because there's part of me that doubts that; I feel like I'm the one who's causing the issues.", "So weird lol.", "WOW! Like the word \u201cpasta\u201d insinuates that sauce will be included. I dunno. It\u2019s like, I love buttered noodles as much as the next person, but it\u2019s because I love butter! Noodles are just a vehicle for what you top them with!", "Apparently she only bought the fries and onion rings, according to op's other comments", "Exactly!", "Idk man considering that she\u2019s got to the point of being bf/gf she should be able to estimate how much he normally eats and can\u2019t just assume since this was enough for me it should be enough for you.", "If she is regularly like this, I would say this is most likely bad girlfriend category and not your insecurities.", "Plus you were most likely hangry.", "Possibly.", "This was my thought. Either that or she was going to give him the meal but then got hungry and scarfed the burger and thought he\u2019d be fine.", "Yeah, but that still bothers me cuz how childish is it to not tell someone that even though you said you had dinner covered, you don't now. So he didn't plan in his head that he either needed to go get himself food or be prepared to cook when he came home. Like they live together and they are adults, it doesn't make sense for the phase of life they are in", "Yes. And then blames him.", "I think because in all honesty fries and onion rings don't constitute a meal. They're more a snack. So the fact she texted and said he didn't have to worry about dinner and only had onion rings and fries is a bit misleading on her part.", "As a non American, please don't try to imply that we don't know what a full meal is. Just because we're not from the US doesn't mean we're that stupid.", "Because she said she got dinner (implies a complete meal) and ordered extra food.

Her saying \u201cdon\u2019t worry about dinner, I\u2019ll get food for both of us\u201d is her telling OP that she\u2019ll get dinner for him, which after 2 years of dating she should know how much he eats for dinner. \n\nShe could\u2019ve easily said \u201cimma get dinner and order extra fries for you, if that\u2019s not enough you might need to pick up some more food on your way home\u201d", "I\u2019m not going after you.

I grew up poor and there were times when food was a luxury instead of a given and I would have been thrilled for an extra serving of fries. That still doesn't change the basic standard. Leftover fries and/or onion rings does not a meal make and I'm baffled at what the GF is up to with this. \n\nAlso, be very cautious of anyone who is going to use the silent treatment as punishment in an argument. That is an extremely manipulative tactic in my opinion.", ">French fries\n\nAaah I think I see where Im going wrong. You guys dont have a fish and chip culture.\n\nDown here in Australia the chips /fries are the biggest cheapest most filling part of the meal. \n\nFor poor people getting it as a treat, you mostly get a few scoops of fries in a big parcel and then just add some cheap battered thing like squid rings, onion rings, pineapple rings, or potato fritters.\n\nWhereas to all you Americans it means  those puny little wallets of shoestring fries from your fast food places?", "> French fries \n\nFries counts as a full meal in Belgium. Meat and veggies are optional", "They also said, in literally the same post, that the partner *disagrees* that they're not poor. She said she \"Only had a little bit of money left until her paycheck\" and that's why she didn't buy much. OP also said she *regularly* eats sides as main meals. To me, that sounds like someone who's skimping on food because they can't afford it.\n\nSo it sounds to me like GF is actually still poor, and OP has their goddamn head in the sand and is refusing to acknowledge that.", "Once again, Im not defending her.\n\nI was curious about a cultural difference in the size and make up of takeout chips, which has now been answered for me.\n\nI  was just going off what OP told us.", "Yeah that's far from the economics where I live. What she got would be way cheaper and far more filling.\n\n- chips for 2 people = $6-$8 (edit, and I mean like a whole dinner plate piled up for each person)\n\n- 8 onion rings =$5 \n\n- fish for 2 people = $24 for 2 pieces\n\n- burgers for 2 = $22-$28 for 2 burgers", "Calories does not a meal make.

How many people aren't send to their room as a kid when did something wrong, argued... ? Or put in a 'time out'.

The crying is dramatic. But he did lay the guilt on think himself. He\u2019s NTA , but she\u2019s not exactly in the clear. Calling your SO and saying don\u2019t worry about dinner, and then finding leftover sides in the bag. Well I honestly would feel insulted myself. Because if I make dinner for you and I make sure you have a full meal and just scraps of sides . But you don\u2019t seem to see me as someone who should have the same type of treatment. You treat people the way you want to be treated. That being said if I you are going to start whining and crying about me not appreciating your gesture of goodwill. I\u2019m going to treat you in kind, and I will say that yes I feel insulted by you and your gesture.

I would add some starbust & funyans if I were sharing the meal/ jk", "Exactly! For example, I might eat just pierogies for dinner and be good, but my husband is gonna want meat! So, I just tell him WHAT I have so he can then make an informed decision on whether or not to stop for something else for him to eat, that\u2019s all.", "The issue though is if she didn't accurately estimate how much he wanted to eat and thought giving him half the food was enough then she didn't disrespect him, she was just factually wrong. It's not like she said \"here eat my garbage that's your dinner\" she said \"here eat exactly what I ate\" which doesnt seem to fit in a respect/disrespect paradigm", "I get blindingly hangry & then don\u2019t realize until I get the hangry headache. To me she sounds pretty inconsiderate, I mean for my bf whom I love more than chocolate or coffee- I would have gone hungry to get an adequate quantity of food in his belly.

Chips and onion rings are not considered as a proper meal. It's a side to a main course. You can have chicken or fish with chips on the side. \n\nI can understand that different parts of the world consider a meal differently. But in terms of this situation, the gf would know the kind of meals OP has for his dinner after a long day of work. If he always has a proper meal (chicken, some rice with gravy, fries) just as examples, she would know so just getting fries and onion rings which is not even a separate portion for him and just scraps of what she has eaten is kinda bad.", "Fish is the main part of fish and chips bro. Source: am british", "Nope. I already explained it.", "Which is also why people keep talking about portions! If I was getting a meal of fish and chips for me and my wife I'd just say three scoops of chips and and it all goes into the same package. No particular size is implied.", "It was fries and onion rings that were sitting out. That\u2019s not generous.", "Share after the fact isn\u2019t sharing.  If she told the waiter to pack half up separately before serving then maybe we can swing it.  She ate what she wanted then put the rest in the bag for him.", "Does and should are very different, though. If she does know and disregarded it then yes saying she disrespected him might be accurate, but if she should know but made an oversight or misjudged then its annoying but not disrespectful. People misread their partners' wants all the time, and if he has no specific reason other than the outcome to say that she was intentionally disrespecting him versus making a mistake. And at the same time she shouldnt have gotten so defensive when he wanted to eat more, obviously. But they should probably talk before jumping right to recriminations and silent treatment", "I\u2019m sorry that you have to make that sacrifice & hope the situation improves.", "[deleted]", "OP stated in other comments that she tends to be inconsiderate, such as throwing her dog a birthday party and ignoring his birthday.", "Ah I see. I think people are saying scraps not because of the fries and onions rings. It's because she ate half or more of the portion and gave him the leftovers or scraps. She should gotten him a separate portion for himself or something better.", "Yeah I see now that some other countries don't get multiple portions of chips and onion rings and stuff all wrapped up in the same package, so the fact its out of the same package = one portion/leftovers.\n\nI was confused because if I buy my wife a separate portion of chips it just gets thrown in with mine unless I specially tell them not to.", "There's a burger place here in the US called Five Guys. When you order a regular order of fries, they give you a big bag that two people can easily share. If you get a large, it's enough for 3-4. You rip open the bag in the middle of the table and go at it. \n\nMcDonald's and Wendy's are much smaller portions. I'd be interested to know where she went."]}
