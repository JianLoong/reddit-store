I've been making a lot of progress over the last few months, but these past two weeks, I've been extremely anxious and have fallen back into some of my old compulsive behaviors (checking my heart rate and blood pressure, asking for reassurance, and even going to the emergency room--more on that in a bit).\n\nRecently, when I tell my boyfriend I'm feeling particularly anxious, he'll just say \"oh no\" or \"everything is fine\" and then immediately go back to whatever he's doing, usually playing video games or doing something on his phone. I've told him that sometimes this bothers me, and would like a little more support or not to feel like I'm competing with a video game for his attention, and he thinks this is an unfair assessment, and that there's not much more he can really do for me other than reassure me.\n\nI recognize his point. The whole idea of anxiety is that it is mostly immune to reassurance. I also recognize that I can be a lot. Between panic attacks and thinking I'm going to die on a nightly basis, my need for reassurance can sometimes be great. That said, is it unreasonable for me to maybe want him to put down the controller every so often and actually talk me? He knows that I'm usually able to calm down if I just work through things.\n\nBeing alone is a huge trigger for me because I fear dying suddenly with no one around to witness and call emergency services. The other night, I had a very, very bad panic attack about this (heart rate was jumping from the 40s to the 120s back to the 40s, breathing was impossible, chest pain was crushing and consistent--I, of course, thought I was going to die).\n\nMy boyfriend was asleep and had work the next day and so as much as I wanted to wake him for help, I knew it was probably anxiety and him getting some sleep was more important.\n\nI did, however, need the panic attack to end and even though I knew it was probably anxiety, I also thought I was genuinely going to die (for those of you who don't suffer from anxiety/panic attacks, I know that doesn't make sense, but these things can really warp your reality). So, I called 911 to take me to the ER (probably should've Ubered, I know) where I knew I could calm down.\n\nWhen I told him about it the next day, the first thing he did was yell, \"what is wrong with you?\" He then proceeded to say that I know nothing is wrong with me so it makes no sense that I would call 911. His tone was very, very exasperated, bordering anger, and then asked if I called 911 to our apartment. I said yes (where else would I call them? lol), which upset him more.\n\nAm I being unreasonable for asking him to do more to try and help me through panic attacks? And am I wrong for calling 911 for a panic attack? AITA?\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add that it was EMS that recommened I go to the ER. My diastolic blood pressure was in the 190s which, panic attack or not, is dangerous. Thanks for weighing in guys!\n\nAnother edit: not sure where everyone is seeing that I knew it was just a panic attack, but I definitely didn't. I figured it probably was anxiety, but I'm not gambling with my life like that.\n\nEdit: upon advice I should also mention I have an enlarged heart which my doctor was not extremely concerned about, but I do not technically have a healthy heart. Don't know why that's all that relevant. To everyone reading, please seek medical attention if you ever have chest pain that you think is abnormal.\n\nEdit: I've been working with my PCP, Therapist, and Psychiatrist since my panic attacks began. They have been well managed since September of 2022 and did not resurface but for one last week.\n\nLast edit: I did some damage control for me and now I want to do some damage control for my boyfriend. I appreciate those who want better for me, and if I could I would list the million and one ways he does support me. He really is the kindest soul I have ever met and is just frustrated with the siutation as I am.", "created_utc": 1676203673, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110e9dg/aita_for_calling_911/", "score": 282, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's not to chastise you for calling when you think you have an emergency, but there are other people in the world who are sick and dying. 911 is for life-threatening emergencies, serious injuries, etc. You know that a panic attack is not life-threatening. And, before you ask, yes, I absolutely have had panic attacks before and I know the feeling that you're going to die. I also know that, once you have had one, you can typically recognize exactly what it is.\n\nI'll be honest, here. I don't think your problem is necessarily just the anxiety. I think your problem is that you seem to have an expectation that your anxiety is someone else's responsibility. I'm not talking about medical services, here, but about your boyfriend. It is not fair for him to drop everything he is doing every time you feel anxious. I'm sorry, but that is not a reasonable ask. I very much hope you are in therapy and have considered other treatments for anxiety. It sounds as though you have learned to use your boyfriend as a coping mechanism. He did not sign up for this and you cannot use another human being as your coping mechanism for anxiety.

I know you can feel weak during panic attacks and don't want to bother people, but you can't go straight to the ER when you have loved ones right next to you who could help you get through panic attacks quicker. It's also important for your loved ones to know you trusted them enough to be there for you.\n\nIf you *don't* feel like he can support you during panic attacks because you feel he dismisses your anxiety issues, that's a problem you need to address.\n\n2 - If you knew that it was a panic attack and you couldn't resolve it on your own, calling 911 was a good idea (in the absence of your boyfriend and other loved ones, I mean).

Panic attacks may be mental, but they have very REAL consequences to your physical body. You were right to call the ambulance. You could have had a heart attack or stroke!!\n\nI\u2019ve had anxiety disorder for about 17 years now, and it SUCKS. My panic attacks always start while I\u2019m sleeping (which just proves that we are not in control of these things). \n\nI have two suggestions. First, find a body pillow that has surface in front of you, under your head, and behind your back. There\u2019s one out right now that I like. Looks like a puffy, white candy cane.  Second, try having your bf (assuming he\u2019s willing) hold you tight when you\u2019re having an attack. Close your eyes and focus on HIS breathing and heartbeat. Have him repeat over and over in a gentle voice, \u201cEverything will be ok.\u201d Not \u201cIS ok\u201d, but \u201cwill be\u201d.\n\nThese two things helped me a lot. The second worked magic for me until my husband died. Then I found the body pillows.

But when we do need help, being dismissed by someone we love throws it all into a tail spin.

I literally was told by the police department to call 911 because I needed to report my neighbors for being incredibly loud at 12 am. So what she did was a proper use of the resources available.

More often than not, I end up not needing to transport these patients. I do end up spending a large amount of time on scene with them, trying to help them work through the panic attack until they decide they're feeling OK to stay home. I like it when I can help people feel better. I like it when they can stay home rather than go to the ER, especially since the hospital tends to not be a relaxing place. But there's a real frustration when I hear a call go out a handful of blocks away for someone who can't breathe or is possibly having a heart attack and rather than being able to get to them in a few minutes, I hear the responding unit take 10-15 minutes to get on scene. I can't leave the patient I'm with. Even if I hear CPR in progress, I can't go help and that patient has to wait that much longer for a different ambulance. \n\nIt's one thing to call when you can't breathe or have chest pain, but don't know that it's a panic attack. That's my most common scenario. But calling when you KNOW that's what's going on, that's where the soft YTA comes in. You should've woken your bf up. If he was that against you calling 911, I would guess he'd be more actively supportive if you told him that you were thinking of calling because you didn't know what else to do. It'd be nice if he was more actively supportive in general, but there are other comments that address this issue.\n\nI will say this, if your diastolic BP (the bottom number)  was legitimately over 190, that's a legit reason to go in and that's not just anxiety. You have something more serious going on and need to see your PCP.", "I\u2019m not commenting to make a judgement - I\u2019m commenting because I\u2019m about ten years older than you and I KNOW these panic attacks.

It also sucks for your partner who could be acting more kindly, yes, but is also probably stressed out in his own right\u2026 it\u2019s awful to watch someone you love suffer and know that nothing you say can really help. \n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me I\u2019m guessing you respond to reassurance during one of these attacks with that persistent doubt in your head that keeps saying \u201cbut what if this IS the big one?!\u201d That\u2019s an exhausting pattern for both of you. \n\nI also see that you are working your ass off to resolve these.

If it was a heart attack it was a heart attack and I may die but odds were much higher that this was another episode. I didn\u2019t want to go to the ER that night so I took a really hot shower instead (adding a new sensation to distract from my heart) and put on my favorite show (more distraction) and within an hour it had passed. It was an hour that I genuinely thought I was gonna die\u2026 but then I didn\u2019t. I got through it. And the panic attacks lost a little power that day because I was able to ignore them. \n\nIt\u2019s been about six or seven years of powering through like that and they happen less and less often now.

I understand where all the Y-T-A votes are coming from, but I disagree. 911 is not just for emergencies, it's also for when you think there might be an emergency. It's not always clear cut, and it's not wrong to err on the side of caution. You had real physical symptoms, combined with a strong sense of panic and anxiety telling you something was seriously wrong. At the same time, you had your rational side trying to talk you out of believing something was wrong. It's a lot of deal with crashing altogether at once, and you weren't really in a position to know for sure what was going on with your body. 911 may have been an overreaction this time, but it's just as possible that it wasn't. \n\nIn regards to your boyfriend, I do have some concerns about that, and I'm not sure I can articulate exactly why.

In a way, you're making him an authority on your medical well-being, and I don't feel like that's fair. As a caretaker, I can say that being the one that someone else turns to for reassurance is just a huge emotional drain. It's a role that fills me with dread and self-doubt. And your boyfriend is already showing signs of burnout. Again, I don't think Y-T-A, but I don't see your relationship lasting if things continue as they are.

You can test it for free for 14 days as a trial.\n\nBut there are others that are completely free as well.\n\nWhen we have panic attacks we often are also hyperventilating and this makes the brain more excitable and then the panic only grows. During a panic attack you can try to take 10 - 12 breaths into a paper bag (like a lunch bag). It helps against hyperventilation because you are re-breathing your exhaled CO2. Hyperventilation is a loss and subsequent deficiency of CO2. This leads to various physical symptoms that feel like anxiety and can cause anxiety. \n\nYou shouldn't breathe into a bag for more than 10 - 12 breaths, because that could lead to too much CO2 and lack of oxygen. \n\nBut for 10 breaths it's ok and it often does wonders against anxiety attacks. \n\nReally, there are ways to beat this and get well again.\n\nCalling 911 is not a good solution for panic attacks for the future.", "ESH.

You took these services away from someone who needed it.", "You have several things going here. Your anxiety about dying is what needs to be addressed in your therapy sessions and you need to find coping mechanisms for that. \n\nA true panic attack in the medical sense causes real physical symptoms which is what you described unable to breath crushing chest pain and increased heart rate and blood pressure. This is a medical emergency. Whilst it isn\u2019t a heart attack, those physical symptoms could indeed lead to a heart attack if the symptoms continue for long enough. You are NTA for calling 911 in this situation because quite frankly having those physical symptoms is scary as fuck and often does need medical intervention to stabilise them. \n\nAn anxiety attack is very different. You can have palpitations and breathing issues but using techniques you can often bring yourself out of an anxiety attack. \n\nI do think you need to have a chat with someone about this panic attack and make sure your meds are correct. I also think you need to find other coping mechanisms other than your bf for your anxiety about dying and your anxiety attacks.

Fine. You also seem to have a dependency problem. You reach out to others when anxious, demanding that they help you.

Unfortunately, when a grown adult get needy like a young one, it isn\u2019t very attractive or appealing and does not evoke the same response as a baby. The heart does not get warm and comforting, instead disgust gets triggered. \n\nYour therapist should be teaching you to self-soothe, since that is the only answer. Instead of reaching out you have to learn to reach within to a nurturing part of your own self who will care for the frightened child. In this way we mature and can partner with others in healthy relationships. What you currently demand of your partner is unrealistic. There is a solution, and it\u2019s entirely inside. People with good parenting learn to self-soothe, unfortunately many of us didn\u2019t have parents who\u2019d learnt it themselves.

She does not drink, smoke or do drugs, and is not overweight and does not have any other preexisting conditions that would have made it more likely to happen that she was aware of. At first she thought she had an earache as that was the only symptom she had was not being able to hear out her ear. I don't think many realize how serious a panic attack can actually be. The EMT's were correct in referring you to call an ambulance. But sending your blood pressure dangerously high can have serious physical consequences I don't think many are taking into account.\n\nAll of my fathers strokes (4) and heart attacks (2) also happened while my father was losing his temper. He is no longer with us now. The car accident that put him in the hospital the last time was caused by a stroke he was having because he was angry as well. People  need to take their emotional control much more seriously.", "NTA. While calling 911 for a panic attack is usually the wrong thing to do, your blood pressure was in the 190s (wait, *diastolic*? Holy shit), and so you did in fact need 911.", "NTA, and I'm annoyed at how many people in the comments don't realize the physical symptoms of a panic attack can be genuinely alarming to the point that yeah, you may need emergency assistance.  Like in the moment *you* don't know if it's anxiety or a genuine issue. Let me give a counter example from my life: one night, I had severe insomnia and I was shivering (it was warm that evening, and I didn't feel cold at all). Shivering is usually a sign that I'm experiencing a panic attack or I have an actual fever, so I took my temp - no fever. I took a half a Xanax but it didn't seem to help. I spent the entire night awake and then in the morning I was feeling very I'll and particularly so, so thirsty. I assumed I felt bad from the lack of sleep. I drank as much water as I could and felt too nauseous to eat food. At this point the symptoms were weird and not like any panic attack I had experienced, BUT ALSO the shivering physical symptom was one that hasn't always existed with my panic attacks - sometimes the body just decides to make a new physical symptom! My sister, a nurse, thought I might be diabetic and gave me advice on what I should do - drink bone broth and take potassium. The next morning my symptoms felt relieved but not gone, so sister said it couldn't be diabetes, because a blood sugar issue could not have resolved so fast. At that point I was sure that my body has just invented a dumb new physical symptom and I'd be completely done by the next day. The thing is, each day I feel better but the symptoms end up lasting the whole week, so finally I go to my doctor 5 days into this problem. And that's when I got told to head to the ER because I'm in kidney failure.\n\nThe moral of the story is, you really, really can't guess that it's just your anxiety when your body goes haywire. Even if it really seems like it might just be an anxiety attack.", "I\u2019ll get downvoted into hell for this, but OP I\u2019m sorry people are being rude. I have suffered from panic attacks in the past and it literally does feel like you\u2019re going to die. While, yes, this may not have been worthy of an ambulance call, I have known of people to call the ambulance for a UTI. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Don\u2019t let people arm diagnose and tell you you\u2019re not doing enough. I know mental health is a weird, windy road to finding the treatment and meds that work well for you. Something is clearly triggering your panic again all of a sudden. I would reflect upon what that might be. Is it the boyfriend? Is it another outside life influence? Him being completely unsupportive really may be impacting your mental health more than you even realize. I once dated a guy who literally just stood overtop of me while I was having a major panic attack, as if I was some sort of science experiment. He just stood there silent while I was screaming at him to get out. I realized later that him being who he was absolutely effected my mental health. Once I got rid of him, my panic attacks began to get so much better. I\u2019m NOT saying to jump to breaking up with boyfriend, but at least do some reflection on whether he is helping your situation, or adding to it. Also, I once was driving and for some reason felt really short of breath. I was coming up on an urgent care center, so flew into the parking lot and took everything I had to run into the lobby and collapsed. I was having a major panic attack. I thought I was having a stroke. My hands balled up into fists that I could not manage to relax at all. I then thought I was having an actual heart attack. They had to send me to the ER to get an IV. People who haven\u2019t experienced panic attacks do not understand, even a little bit, how debilitating they can be. Do what is best for yourself in the moment you feel you need help. I completely understand that being in or near a hospital, to know that you can get emergency attention if it gets to that point, helps calm you down. Feel free to DM me if you ever need someone to help talk you through. Remember your 5 senses: find something you can touch, smell, taste, hear and see. Ground yourself. NAH.

It sounds like you need more progress in therapy and need to be single while you figure out what you need, maybe even try medicine that will help prevent your brain from going from 0 to 150 so quickly. Sometimes therapy is needed in conjunction with medicine. And there is no shame in getting additional help. CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is also very helpful, even group therapy is helpful. To put it all on your boyfriend might be a huge burden for him. I mean if he is so busy caring for your mental health how can he take care of his own?  Give your boyfriend a break. If you do live with him, maybe set healthier boundaries ask about that in therapy. If you keep things the way they are, he will break up with you because you didn\u2019t do anything additional to help yourself with your anxiety.\n\nI say all of this as a person with anxiety.

Can you ask some friends if they would be willing to talk to you on the phone when you\u2019re anxious? Does either your therapist or psychiatrist accept emergency calls? Are there any crisis lines you\u2019d be willing to try? I know there aren\u2019t any for your specific issue, but many can be pretty general and might tide you over short term.

The results were perfectly fine. Nothing weird. The doctor looked at me with pity and basically said \"Sweetie, you just have really high anxiety.\" \n\nAnxiety can do such strange things to you and also warp your sense of reality into thinking that you are dying. While I can't fault you too much for contacting an emergency service while you thought you were dying, you really should have woken your boyfriend for help. He could have assisted you with calming down and very likely could have made you realize that you didn't need any emergency services.\n\nI hope that you find ways to manage your anxiety so that it doesn't reach a point this severe. My panic attack that sent me to an urgent care was 4 years ago. I haven't had one that intense but I still have pretty bad ones.
