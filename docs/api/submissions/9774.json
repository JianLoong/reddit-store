I've been making a lot of progress over the last few months, but these past two weeks, I've been extremely anxious and have fallen back into some of my old compulsive behaviors (checking my heart rate and blood pressure, asking for reassurance, and even going to the emergency room--more on that in a bit).\n\nRecently, when I tell my boyfriend I'm feeling particularly anxious, he'll just say \"oh no\" or \"everything is fine\" and then immediately go back to whatever he's doing, usually playing video games or doing something on his phone. I've told him that sometimes this bothers me, and would like a little more support or not to feel like I'm competing with a video game for his attention, and he thinks this is an unfair assessment, and that there's not much more he can really do for me other than reassure me.\n\nI recognize his point. The whole idea of anxiety is that it is mostly immune to reassurance. I also recognize that I can be a lot. Between panic attacks and thinking I'm going to die on a nightly basis, my need for reassurance can sometimes be great. That said, is it unreasonable for me to maybe want him to put down the controller every so often and actually talk me? He knows that I'm usually able to calm down if I just work through things.\n\nBeing alone is a huge trigger for me because I fear dying suddenly with no one around to witness and call emergency services. The other night, I had a very, very bad panic attack about this (heart rate was jumping from the 40s to the 120s back to the 40s, breathing was impossible, chest pain was crushing and consistent--I, of course, thought I was going to die).\n\nMy boyfriend was asleep and had work the next day and so as much as I wanted to wake him for help, I knew it was probably anxiety and him getting some sleep was more important.\n\nI did, however, need the panic attack to end and even though I knew it was probably anxiety, I also thought I was genuinely going to die (for those of you who don't suffer from anxiety/panic attacks, I know that doesn't make sense, but these things can really warp your reality). So, I called 911 to take me to the ER (probably should've Ubered, I know) where I knew I could calm down.\n\nWhen I told him about it the next day, the first thing he did was yell, \"what is wrong with you?\" He then proceeded to say that I know nothing is wrong with me so it makes no sense that I would call 911. His tone was very, very exasperated, bordering anger, and then asked if I called 911 to our apartment. I said yes (where else would I call them? lol), which upset him more.\n\nAm I being unreasonable for asking him to do more to try and help me through panic attacks? And am I wrong for calling 911 for a panic attack? AITA?\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add that it was EMS that recommened I go to the ER. My diastolic blood pressure was in the 190s which, panic attack or not, is dangerous.

You knew that what you were experiencing was a panic attack and not a life-threatening medical emergency, from the sounds of it, yes? And if your boyfriend had been awake, you wouldn't have called?\n\nThe people who operate 911 services are real people, who respond to every call, who were taken out of commission for yours. That's not to chastise you for calling when you think you have an emergency, but there are other people in the world who are sick and dying. 911 is for life-threatening emergencies, serious injuries, etc. You know that a panic attack is not life-threatening. And, before you ask, yes, I absolutely have had panic attacks before and I know the feeling that you're going to die. I also know that, once you have had one, you can typically recognize exactly what it is.\n\nI'll be honest, here. I don't think your problem is necessarily just the anxiety. I think your problem is that you seem to have an expectation that your anxiety is someone else's responsibility. I'm not talking about medical services, here, but about your boyfriend. It is not fair for him to drop everything he is doing every time you feel anxious. I'm sorry, but that is not a reasonable ask. I very much hope you are in therapy and have considered other treatments for anxiety. It sounds as though you have learned to use your boyfriend as a coping mechanism. He did not sign up for this and you cannot use another human being as your coping mechanism for anxiety.

I know you can feel weak during panic attacks and don't want to bother people, but you can't go straight to the ER when you have loved ones right next to you who could help you get through panic attacks quicker. It's also important for your loved ones to know you trusted them enough to be there for you.\n\nIf you *don't* feel like he can support you during panic attacks because you feel he dismisses your anxiety issues, that's a problem you need to address.\n\n2 - If you knew that it was a panic attack and you couldn't resolve it on your own, calling 911 was a good idea (in the absence of your boyfriend and other loved ones, I mean).

Panic attacks may be mental, but they have very REAL consequences to your physical body. You were right to call the ambulance. You could have had a heart attack or stroke!!\n\nI\u2019ve had anxiety disorder for about 17 years now, and it SUCKS. My panic attacks always start while I\u2019m sleeping (which just proves that we are not in control of these things). \n\nI have two suggestions. First, find a body pillow that has surface in front of you, under your head, and behind your back. There\u2019s one out right now that I like. Looks like a puffy, white candy cane.  Second, try having your bf (assuming he\u2019s willing) hold you tight when you\u2019re having an attack. Close your eyes and focus on HIS breathing and heartbeat. Have him repeat over and over in a gentle voice, \u201cEverything will be ok.\u201d Not \u201cIS ok\u201d, but \u201cwill be\u201d.\n\nThese two things helped me a lot. The second worked magic for me until my husband died. Then I found the body pillows.

My health anxiety  didn't start until later in life and I have a completely unsupportive husband. To the fact that he doesn't really believe in mental health issues.

He can literally make you feel more alone than actually being alone.  \n\nI too realize how hard it must be on our partners, but for him to completely dismiss you messes with your head even more than the health anxiety does.

Now you have doubt and self hate swirling in with panic and thoughts of dying. \n\nShould we get to a point where we can self assure, of course that's a goal.  But when we do need help, being dismissed by someone we love throws it all into a tail spin. If he cannot support you (and I don't mean be your personal therapist, or being your crutch...which it doesn't seem like you want or are doing), then he is not the right person for you and can actually now be making things worse.  \n\nKeep on being strong.

Has anyone suggested medication?", "I've called - they deal with any mental health crisis", "Yep I work at a 988 provider, it is suicide prevention as well as general mental health crisis situations.", "This topic is too complex for AITA. As someone who has suffered from debilitating panic attacks and has absolutely got people to ring emergency services \u2018in case this time I\u2019m actually dying\u2019 I feel for you. \n\n\nIt\u2019s such a horrid feeling and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy and I really, really feel for you. When it gets to such a stage the physical symptoms are entirely comparable to heart attacks etc and many people who experience panic attacks for the first time, ring ambulances and even going forward.\n\n\nI hope you find a new way to manage them a bit better and definitely NAH.", "It was totally for attention that you felt you weren't getting. Thanks to people like you. Ambulances have wait times. And people die.", "Are you having bad reactions to meds? Are you afraid that you'll abuse them? And I noticed from your other comments that you use the short hand PD. Do you mean a personality disorder?", "So youd rather just be unmedicated and pulling this shit rather than speaking to a therapist and a psychiatrist to figure out the proper dosage? \nI cannot imagine how tired of this the people around you are. \n\nIts fully attention seeking atp. YTA", "Why not Atarax or Vistaril?", "Your comment has been removed because it does not address the OP in good faith.\r\n\r\nIf you suspect a post breaks one of our rules, please report it instead of commenting.\r\n\r\nIf you have meta feedback about the subreddit, please contain it to our monthly forum.

There's no need to guilt-trip someone who just went through a terrible panic attack.", "panic disorder. i've had hallicuniations on benzos before, and benzo abuse runs in the family.", "i said i'm on ssris. that stabds for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and it is a long-term medication you take for anxiety with little potential for overuse or abuse. it was prescribed to me by my psychiatrist and i update my therapist weekly with how it's going.", "This was an extremely cruel thing to say to someone who is genuinely struggling. What is wrong with you. Be a better person.", "A few different things come to mind. Maybe you should look into getting rTMS. Get a consult into whether it is right for you or not. It's been shown to help decrease anxiety. \n\nOr maybe you should talk with your psychiatrist and look into medications with a lower potential for abuse. The kind of life you're describing seems like you have a really low quality of life. It doesn't sound sustainable.", "i'm meeting with my psychiatrist soon to discuss the recent uptick in anxiety. it really has been well managed for a while now and i've gone through the long, arduous process of finding thr right med. part of the reason i was so concern there might be something medically wrong was that i'd not had a panic attack that severe in over a year and i got to thinking that if my anxiety is well managed, this could be something else."]}
