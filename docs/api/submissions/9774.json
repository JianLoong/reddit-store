I've been making a lot of progress over the last few months, but these past two weeks, I've been extremely anxious and have fallen back into some of my old compulsive behaviors (checking my heart rate and blood pressure, asking for reassurance, and even going to the emergency room--more on that in a bit).\n\nRecently, when I tell my boyfriend I'm feeling particularly anxious, he'll just say \"oh no\" or \"everything is fine\" and then immediately go back to whatever he's doing, usually playing video games or doing something on his phone. I've told him that sometimes this bothers me, and would like a little more support or not to feel like I'm competing with a video game for his attention, and he thinks this is an unfair assessment, and that there's not much more he can really do for me other than reassure me.\n\nI recognize his point. The whole idea of anxiety is that it is mostly immune to reassurance. I also recognize that I can be a lot. Between panic attacks and thinking I'm going to die on a nightly basis, my need for reassurance can sometimes be great. That said, is it unreasonable for me to maybe want him to put down the controller every so often and actually talk me? He knows that I'm usually able to calm down if I just work through things.\n\nBeing alone is a huge trigger for me because I fear dying suddenly with no one around to witness and call emergency services. The other night, I had a very, very bad panic attack about this (heart rate was jumping from the 40s to the 120s back to the 40s, breathing was impossible, chest pain was crushing and consistent--I, of course, thought I was going to die).\n\nMy boyfriend was asleep and had work the next day and so as much as I wanted to wake him for help, I knew it was probably anxiety and him getting some sleep was more important.\n\nI did, however, need the panic attack to end and even though I knew it was probably anxiety, I also thought I was genuinely going to die (for those of you who don't suffer from anxiety/panic attacks, I know that doesn't make sense, but these things can really warp your reality). So, I called 911 to take me to the ER (probably should've Ubered, I know) where I knew I could calm down.\n\nWhen I told him about it the next day, the first thing he did was yell, \"what is wrong with you?\" He then proceeded to say that I know nothing is wrong with me so it makes no sense that I would call 911. His tone was very, very exasperated, bordering anger, and then asked if I called 911 to our apartment. I said yes (where else would I call them? lol), which upset him more.\n\nAm I being unreasonable for asking him to do more to try and help me through panic attacks? And am I wrong for calling 911 for a panic attack? AITA?\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add that it was EMS that recommened I go to the ER. My diastolic blood pressure was in the 190s which, panic attack or not, is dangerous. Thanks for weighing in guys!\n\nAnother edit: not sure where everyone is seeing that I knew it was just a panic attack, but I definitely didn't.

That's not to chastise you for calling when you think you have an emergency, but there are other people in the world who are sick and dying. 911 is for life-threatening emergencies, serious injuries, etc. You know that a panic attack is not life-threatening. And, before you ask, yes, I absolutely have had panic attacks before and I know the feeling that you're going to die. I also know that, once you have had one, you can typically recognize exactly what it is.\n\nI'll be honest, here. I don't think your problem is necessarily just the anxiety. I think your problem is that you seem to have an expectation that your anxiety is someone else's responsibility. I'm not talking about medical services, here, but about your boyfriend. It is not fair for him to drop everything he is doing every time you feel anxious. I'm sorry, but that is not a reasonable ask. I very much hope you are in therapy and have considered other treatments for anxiety. It sounds as though you have learned to use your boyfriend as a coping mechanism.

I know you can feel weak during panic attacks and don't want to bother people, but you can't go straight to the ER when you have loved ones right next to you who could help you get through panic attacks quicker. It's also important for your loved ones to know you trusted them enough to be there for you.\n\nIf you *don't* feel like he can support you during panic attacks because you feel he dismisses your anxiety issues, that's a problem you need to address.\n\n2 - If you knew that it was a panic attack and you couldn't resolve it on your own, calling 911 was a good idea (in the absence of your boyfriend and other loved ones, I mean).

My panic attacks always start while I\u2019m sleeping (which just proves that we are not in control of these things). \n\nI have two suggestions. First, find a body pillow that has surface in front of you, under your head, and behind your back. There\u2019s one out right now that I like. Looks like a puffy, white candy cane.  Second, try having your bf (assuming he\u2019s willing) hold you tight when you\u2019re having an attack. Close your eyes and focus on HIS breathing and heartbeat. Have him repeat over and over in a gentle voice, \u201cEverything will be ok.\u201d Not \u201cIS ok\u201d, but \u201cwill be\u201d.\n\nThese two things helped me a lot.

My health anxiety  didn't start until later in life and I have a completely unsupportive husband. To the fact that he doesn't really believe in mental health issues.

But when we do need help, being dismissed by someone we love throws it all into a tail spin.

More often than not, I end up not needing to transport these patients. I do end up spending a large amount of time on scene with them, trying to help them work through the panic attack until they decide they're feeling OK to stay home. I like it when I can help people feel better. I like it when they can stay home rather than go to the ER, especially since the hospital tends to not be a relaxing place. But there's a real frustration when I hear a call go out a handful of blocks away for someone who can't breathe or is possibly having a heart attack and rather than being able to get to them in a few minutes, I hear the responding unit take 10-15 minutes to get on scene. I can't leave the patient I'm with. Even if I hear CPR in progress, I can't go help and that patient has to wait that much longer for a different ambulance. \n\nIt's one thing to call when you can't breathe or have chest pain, but don't know that it's a panic attack. That's my most common scenario. But calling when you KNOW that's what's going on, that's where the soft YTA comes in. You should've woken your bf up. If he was that against you calling 911, I would guess he'd be more actively supportive if you told him that you were thinking of calling because you didn't know what else to do. It'd be nice if he was more actively supportive in general, but there are other comments that address this issue.\n\nI will say this, if your diastolic BP (the bottom number)  was legitimately over 190, that's a legit reason to go in and that's not just anxiety. You have something more serious going on and need to see your PCP.", "I\u2019m not commenting to make a judgement - I\u2019m commenting because I\u2019m about ten years older than you and I KNOW these panic attacks.

It also sucks for your partner who could be acting more kindly, yes, but is also probably stressed out in his own right\u2026 it\u2019s awful to watch someone you love suffer and know that nothing you say can really help. \n\nIf you\u2019re anything like me I\u2019m guessing you respond to reassurance during one of these attacks with that persistent doubt in your head that keeps saying \u201cbut what if this IS the big one?!\u201d That\u2019s an exhausting pattern for both of you. \n\nI also see that you are working your ass off to resolve these.

If it was a heart attack it was a heart attack and I may die but odds were much higher that this was another episode. I didn\u2019t want to go to the ER that night so I took a really hot shower instead (adding a new sensation to distract from my heart) and put on my favorite show (more distraction) and within an hour it had passed. It was an hour that I genuinely thought I was gonna die\u2026 but then I didn\u2019t. I got through it. And the panic attacks lost a little power that day because I was able to ignore them. \n\nIt\u2019s been about six or seven years of powering through like that and they happen less and less often now.

I understand where all the Y-T-A votes are coming from, but I disagree. 911 is not just for emergencies, it's also for when you think there might be an emergency. It's not always clear cut, and it's not wrong to err on the side of caution. You had real physical symptoms, combined with a strong sense of panic and anxiety telling you something was seriously wrong. At the same time, you had your rational side trying to talk you out of believing something was wrong. It's a lot of deal with crashing altogether at once, and you weren't really in a position to know for sure what was going on with your body. 911 may have been an overreaction this time, but it's just as possible that it wasn't. \n\nIn regards to your boyfriend, I do have some concerns about that, and I'm not sure I can articulate exactly why.

In a way, you're making him an authority on your medical well-being, and I don't feel like that's fair. As a caretaker, I can say that being the one that someone else turns to for reassurance is just a huge emotional drain. It's a role that fills me with dread and self-doubt. And your boyfriend is already showing signs of burnout. Again, I don't think Y-T-A, but I don't see your relationship lasting if things continue as they are.

You can test it for free for 14 days as a trial.\n\nBut there are others that are completely free as well.\n\nWhen we have panic attacks we often are also hyperventilating and this makes the brain more excitable and then the panic only grows. During a panic attack you can try to take 10 - 12 breaths into a paper bag (like a lunch bag). It helps against hyperventilation because you are re-breathing your exhaled CO2. Hyperventilation is a loss and subsequent deficiency of CO2. This leads to various physical symptoms that feel like anxiety and can cause anxiety. \n\nYou shouldn't breathe into a bag for more than 10 - 12 breaths, because that could lead to too much CO2 and lack of oxygen. \n\nBut for 10 breaths it's ok and it often does wonders against anxiety attacks. \n\nReally, there are ways to beat this and get well again.\n\nCalling 911 is not a good solution for panic attacks for the future.", "ESH.

Sure it could be breast cancer, but if it is there is nothing I can do in this minute to help that.

Your anxiety about dying is what needs to be addressed in your therapy sessions and you need to find coping mechanisms for that. \n\nA true panic attack in the medical sense causes real physical symptoms which is what you described unable to breath crushing chest pain and increased heart rate and blood pressure. This is a medical emergency. Whilst it isn\u2019t a heart attack, those physical symptoms could indeed lead to a heart attack if the symptoms continue for long enough. You are NTA for calling 911 in this situation because quite frankly having those physical symptoms is scary as fuck and often does need medical intervention to stabilise them. \n\nAn anxiety attack is very different. You can have palpitations and breathing issues but using techniques you can often bring yourself out of an anxiety attack. \n\nI do think you need to have a chat with someone about this panic attack and make sure your meds are correct. I also think you need to find other coping mechanisms other than your bf for your anxiety about dying and your anxiety attacks.

Fine. You also seem to have a dependency problem. You reach out to others when anxious, demanding that they help you.

Unfortunately, when a grown adult get needy like a young one, it isn\u2019t very attractive or appealing and does not evoke the same response as a baby. The heart does not get warm and comforting, instead disgust gets triggered. \n\nYour therapist should be teaching you to self-soothe, since that is the only answer. Instead of reaching out you have to learn to reach within to a nurturing part of your own self who will care for the frightened child. In this way we mature and can partner with others in healthy relationships. What you currently demand of your partner is unrealistic. There is a solution, and it\u2019s entirely inside. People with good parenting learn to self-soothe, unfortunately many of us didn\u2019t have parents who\u2019d learnt it themselves.

You're saying that in spite of needing your BF's help to pull you out of your spiral 3-4 times this week, there were multiple times you were in bad shape and didn't go to him, and an ambulance trip to the ER. You say if your boyfriend wasn't there you'd then need your dad there to the degree that you would move. As an outsider looking in this sounds a lot like you have a long term plan of needing other people to manage your condition rather than a long term plan of being able to self-manage with appropriate tools.\n\nNeeding the support of a therapist and psychiatrist to help you manage your condition long term is reasonable. But it's not fair to be reliant on non-professionals (loved ones) to be talking you through your condition regularly (3-4 times a week) while stating you actually need \\*more\\* support than that you just aren't asking for it - BF is probably aware of that and is just fried right now. If he's looking at a future of his downtime being subsumed by you either needing him to help you work through your anxiety or you spiraling in another room to spare him that has to be overwhelming and a real downer to him. When is there time for him or the two of you that your anxiety is not front and center?\n\nThis doesn't mean YTA, but he's definitely NTA for feeling like you're asking for too much.

What you are doing now is not working is it?", "Benzos are not necessarily habit-forming if you take them on an as-needed/intermittent basis. I have used one to manage anxiety for 10 years and take them once or twice a month. At my worst I took them maybe 3x a week. Not all habit-forming drugs are equally habit-forming and you should discuss this with your therapist. Of course, if you have a history of addictive behavior what they decide for you might be different than if you don't. But don't just rule it out based on bias.\n\nThere are also outpatient programs where you go during the day for 4 or so hours. I attended one of those for 4-6 weeks and it was immensely helpful to me. These programs can help teach you very helpful tools for managing your anxiety patterns and provide a safe space to get extended care. It is hard to make significant progress seeing a therapist for an hour once or twice a week, and your case sounds severe enough that you may benefit from more intensive work. I encourage you to keep an open mind, the way you are currently coping is not sustainable.", "in cases like that, when the panic is so severe, i will accept a benzo. i've just declined when they offer to send me home with an emergency script of 5 or 6, or if i don't think it's that serious.", "I took it for rescue after I got pregnant.
