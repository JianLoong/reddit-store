He job hops which is fine if he had another job lined up so he wasn\u2019t out of work in between, but he just quits and then is unemployed.  That is a red flag showing lack of commitment, lack of financial planning, lack of responsibility.  He spends money he does not have.  He does not carry his weight with household bills.  You need to see that he puts guns and his hobby over you.  A reasonable person would not just quit six jobs with no income.  A reasonable person would put household bills above hobbies and guns.  Please see what he is showing you, that you come up last in his priorities.  That isn\u2019t going to change.

Kick his ass to the curb.", "NTA. Think carefully here. If you are afraid this guy will get angry and might hurt you, you need to speak to your local or national domestic violence hotline about making a plan to leave safely. \n\nOtherwise, start thinking about options like living alone or with roommates. You\u2019ll be surprised at how much money you have when you are no longer supporting a mooch.", "NTA. Also a gun collection is creepy as fuck, idc how popular they are in the US. Guns are for killing, why does he need even one? For protection out in the woods or for hunting I can see why you would want one for safety. But if that doesn't apply and he has a \"collection\" that's creepy as fuck and I would get as far away from him as possible.", "NTA; as everyone has already said, it's not about his choice of hobby, but his financial incompetence. But it's very simple; he can buy his gins and repairs with HIS money. If he doesn't have enough money after his obligations, then he has to wait. I don't even think it was a mixed message to help him with his \"once in a lifetime\" purchase, but he OWNS it now, and can wait until HE has money to get it fixed.", "yes", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime to end the relationship over his financial irresponsibility. LOANS for hobbies are a bad thing - but while he is jobless? THAT is even worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet out while you can.", "NTA $400 is not \u201cnothing\u201d\n\nY\u2019all don\u2019t sound compatible. You sound like a responsible adult and he sounds like a brat.", "Freeloader. I see what you did there.", "That\u2019s where my mind went to as well. His impulsive spending on non-essential items doesn\u2019t bode well for anyone nearby when his lack of self-control reveals itself", "Seriously. My wife makes enough to fully support us if shit hits the fan, and my income is savings and entertainment. That doesn't mean I blow all my money on new guns every month. I'd love to, but it's not feasible to do.", "I\u2019m curious and this will sound dumb, (Canadian so don\u2019t have a huge gun culture like US) but when you say gun collection, would it mean that it\u2019s just used as a display, or do people actually use the guns? Sorry just from my understanding collection means having a ton of items for display and not using them as the intended function. Also, what\u2019s the point of having multiple guns that are in use?!?!", "The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. If you stay you\u2019re being an AH to yourself", "My husband collects guns.  I don\u2019t.  He frequently sells and buys guns.  He ALWAYS makes sure he has the money to purchase the gun AND pay for his portion of the bills, etc. before he even considers purchasing a new one and if he doesn\u2019t, then he doesn\u2019t buy it.  Regardless of it being a once in a lifetime thing.", "Being a people pleaser is a negative personality trait. It usually ends up with the person enabling the bad behavior of others to the detriment of oneself and then.\n\nBe kind, caring, compassionate- fine. Being a people pleaser is just being a doormat.", "You're only broke because you're with him.", "Angry AND Texas?!? Tell me you have a gun collection without telling me you have one! (I\u2019m joking, please don\u2019t take offence)", "jesus christ he has access to your bank account, wastes his money on guns and you aren't on birth control. wtf are you doing with your life", "You\u2019re not on birth control? Why tf not? This guy is a totally irresponsible loser. If you\u2019re poor now, how much worse would it be with a kid and no child support?", ">.I\u2019m not on birth control\n\nRight now - call Planned Parenthood and make an appointment.  If you think you have money troubles now, try throwing a baby into the mix.", "Block him on any financial stuff.  Stop giving him money. Cut back on spending and get yourself in a position to leave.  NTA but he is not gonna change.  He is too irresponsible with money.  Jobs.  Etc.", "Oh yes I second planned parenthood. They are really reasonable with the birth control prices and they have an income based payment plan or something", "\u2018merica!", "NTA. He is being irresponsible with money, if it wasn't guns, it'd be something else. \n\nI'd address it abd tell him that he has to show financial discipline or walk. \n\nFinancial problems only get worse with time unless you hunker down and stick to budgets.", "Move back to where you do have support if possible. He is draining your finances. Pay your bills and move on if possible NTA.", "NTA but this guy is an unhinged loser. Six jobs in 1 year. I fear for your safety but you need to dump him.", "NTA. It sounds like you already want to leave, but feel trapped. You need an exit plan. Text him an invoice of all the money he owes you, but do it in a sneaky way (don't want to give a gun nut warning in advance). \"Look, I **lent** you that $400 for the \\[gun name\\], but we can't afford this. Remember how I let you **borrow** $\\[x\\] for \\[rent\\] and $\\[y\\] for \\[y\\]? That money hasn't been returned yet.\" Get him to acknowledge it as a loan. \n\nFind another living situation. Contact homeless shelters or DV advocates for how to get out. (Not saying you're in a DV situation exactly, but they'll know what resources are available.) Maybe looking for roommate wanted postings (but be safe!). Job hunt if you can. Open a separate bank account at a different bank, make sure he doesn't see the mail, and start saving up.) Again, the DV people can give you tips. Keep all of this a secret until you are able to leave. He's not going to handle this well, and he's armed. Trust no one in your mutual groups because this could mean your life. (You posted you're far from family and friends, but I hope there's someone who'd help you out of a possibly dangerous situation.) Be safe, and good luck.", "Well, the super cool thing is that you don't need a reason to justify rights. Not that I agree with the dude, he's a loser with wack priorities, and I'm saying that as someone with probably about a $15k collection.", "Why wait it out, has he given any indication of changing? He has you to pay all of his bills and even finance his hobby, why should he change? \n\nTell him if he can't pay you back the $400 then he will have to sell one or more of his guns. Are his parents aware of how little he contributes?", "I think you've waited too long already. He can marry his guns, since he seems to care more about those than about you", "> Also, what\u2019s the point of having multiple guns that are in use?!?!\n\nDifferent guns shoot differently and have different purposes. Many people like to shoot at targets for fun, and it can be enjoyable to use different types of firearms. Others have multiple types for different types of hunting.", "I have a very small collection -- three handguns, two rifles. Three of them (one rifle, two pistols) are all the same caliber. However, they are all very different.\n\nAnd yes, most collections are meant to be used. People collect all kinds of usable items. My mind immediately goes to someone collecting guitars. Are they great display items? Yep. But people will play each of them for varying situations.", "Thanks!", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "My bad misread", "You're his mommy.  He gets to be a bad boy and you get to pay for it.", "Food and rent first, guns and other things later. NTA. He can get the gun repaired when he goes back to work. No harm at all.", "Literally. Take out the word gun and throw it \"trains\" or \"car parts\".\n\nThe gun thing is a whole other red flag lol.", "How long have you already been waiting it out and hoping for improvement? Has he ever given you $400 (or a similar amount/sacrifice) for something you're passionate about? \n  \nIt sounds like the root of this may not be about any of the surface stuff, but instead, it is about lack of respect, appreciation, and reciprocation. Does he value your sense of security as much as his own? Or is he expecting you to sacrifice for you both, while he's off doing him-stuff? That's my current resentment in my own current relationship, so that may be projection, but this kinda feels similar.", "You're in your 20s with no kids OP. You are far too young to be \"waiting it out\" for a SO with not only no professional prospects, but *also* severe financial irresponsibility. People often leave for just *one* of those giant red flags!", "So you can sell the guns. Because those are yours as well, right?\nHon, I saw couples in your age being skimpy on bauying a washing machine, complaining that id the money is spent and they go their different ways only one will win the washing machine. And here you are, broke and handing money for guns. \nHis spending problems are yours because they're your spending problems. You spent your money so your bf can buy guns.\n\nYou can do better. You can leave. You can put aside money. Hide it from him if needed. You can leave. It doesn't have to be like this."]}
