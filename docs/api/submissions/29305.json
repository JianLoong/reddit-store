{"id": 29305, "submission_id": "17cf8rt", "title": "AITA for suggesting we leave my 4yo niece home when we go to Disney World?", "selftext": "My sister went to Disney World with her husband and two daughters...let's call them Milly and Mara. Milly and Mara are 7 and 4yo respectively. They had so much fun my sister asked if the two of us could go for my birthday in a few months. \n\nI said sure but we should bring her older daughter, Milly, along because she's incredibly well behaved and loves Disney World above all things. I felt it would be an AH move to go without her since she would enjoy it more than both of us combined. **My sister said she couldn't do that because, while she'd feel like an AH going without Milly, she would feel like an even bigger AH taking Milly and leaving Mara behind. She said if Mara ever found out she would feel betrayed.**\n\nThe thing is, during their trip, Milly had the time of her life and was well behaved as usual. Mara also had fun (mainly at the hotel pool) but she is prone to tantrums and not only did she have multiple fits, she refused to go on about 90% of the rides because she was afraid (of the dark, of enclosed spaces, of loud noises, etc.). Of course, this probably isn't all too unusual for a 4yo. But my sister and her husband had to take turns missing rides so one of them could sit with Mara each time she didn't want to go on one.\n\nWhen my sister and I go I would like us to be able to ride whatever we please. Milly won't impede that goal, but Mara would.\n\nPlus I would genuinely enjoy having Milly there. She is hilarious and makes such outings fun. Frankly I would feel like an AH going without her.\n\nSo AITA for my suggestion that we should take Milly and leave Mara with her dad?\n\n**EDIT:** I know I sound like I favor Milly here but I truly adore both girls. It's just that one of them can tolerate waiting in a long line, and even make it fun, while the other does better in more structured/less crowded settings (Mara, for example, is a delight when playing board games). I just wanted to clarify that I really do love them equally.", "created_utc": 1697819079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cf8rt/aita_for_suggesting_we_leave_my_4yo_niece_home/", "score": 462, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Could it be because she wants to actually enjoy Disney World with you and not have to worry about supervising her kids?", "INFO - Have you asked your sister what her expectations of the trip are?", "YTA.  It sounds like your sister's suggestion was for the two of you to go, not for you two plus a child.  Go and leave both kids home.  It's not your responsibility to entertain the older kid with a trip to Mickey, it's her parents'.", "YTA.  Leave them both home.  (Or take them both) Why did you have to complicate a simple outing with your sister with this suggestion that will cause problems with her children ?   Your sister is correct. They\u2019re too young to understand", "YTA - This was just supposed to be a trip for you and your sister, yes? Then don\u2019t involve the kids at all! By telling your sister to bring one girl and not the other, you\u2019re sending a message even if you don\u2019t mean to. Mara will feel there\u2019s something wrong with her because her sister was invited to a fun birthday party with her mom and aunt/uncle, but she wasn\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019\u2019re creating a problem and a wedge that don\u2019t need to exist. Just have the outing with your sister. If you want to spend time with Milly at the park, go another time when the whole family can enjoy it.", "YTA. Either bring both or leave both at home. There's no way the 4 yo isn't going to find out (her sister can't be expected to lie or stay quiet) so she will definitely be upset. How do you intend to explain without telling her that she isn't welcome and you don't want her around?", "YTA Your sister isn't going to take one of her children to Disney and leave the other one home. It was not a reasonable suggestion for you to make.", "YTA. You take both or neither. Obviously you don\u2019t have kids.", "It sounds like your sister asked only two of you should go, if so YTA for suggesting to take her one kid and leave one behind. Some kids might not behave as good as their siblings but that's not a reason to leave them behind while taking the other child, leave both behind.", "YTA. How exactly did you expect your sister to explain this to your niece??", "YTA. First of all, Mara acted very much like a normal 4 year old on the trip. Your post seems to imply that Mara was being bad or a annoyance, but not wanting to go on intense or scary rides is a totally normal thing for a four year old. And sometimes having a meltdown in a crowded, unfamiliar place is totally normal for a four year old. When you take your very young child to an amusement park, you sign on for those things. \n\nSecond, four years old is old enough to know when you're being excluded. You want Mara to sit at home, knowing her sister is out having fun with her mom and aunt? Because that's what would happen. Its also a great way to start breeding resentment between sisters. \n\nEither take both girls or don't take either. I'm sure there's a way to frame it to Milly that its a special trip for you and her mom. It is way more fair for both girls to be disappointed, then for one girl to get a super awesome trip and the other girl to get nothing.", "YWBTA if you only took one of the girls. it would be unfair.\n\nThe sensible thing to do is not to take either and just the 2 of you go.", "YTA. Your sister suggested a sisters-only trip. Why not just leave it at that and go as two adults? Why even suggest you take just one sibling? I know that your motivation is to enjoy the time, and you know that you'd enjoy it with Milly there but not with Mara there--how do you think Mara's going to feel when she finds out? How do you think that will affect your relationship with her? You love them equally, but your actions imply otherwise to Mara, who would be left out of the trip only because she displays standard 4yo behavior. Go just the two of you, or wait until Mara's older so she can also go.", "YTA - She wants it to be just the two of you. She wants an adults weekend where she gets some time off from parenting. Of course she is not going to bring one of her kids and not the other. It\u2019s a ridiculous thing to ask.\n\nAnd whilst Molly might be a delight for you, what awaits your sister when she gets back is going be utterly awful for her and for Mara as well. Are you going to deal with the fallout from that?\n\nMara will not understand being abandoned especially when it\u2019s Disneyworld, a place that, whilst enjoyable for all ages was designed for children.", "100% YTA here and your sister is an Olympic Class great mom.  When Milly comes home babbling about the fantastic time she had with you and her mom at Disney how, exactly, do you think Mara is going to feel?  I'm sure she'll run into plenty of mean girls in school throughout her life-- she doesn't really need one in her own family.", "YTA asking your sister to leave her child behind", "YTA. Neither girl should be invited on this birthday trip. If the event is intended to involve them, they should both be invited.", "YTA, I understand not wanting to miss out on rides, but that's probably why your sister suggested that just the two of you should go. Either go with your sister or invite both of your nieces.", "YTA Its either both or none.", "How about just an adult sibling trip.. that way no child has to be hurt or left behind. \n\nMom should refuse the trip if only one child is invited and other not..\n\nThat\u2019s an Ahole move..", "How lucky you are to have a sister who wants to celebrate such a fun experience with you for your birthday. I'm an aunt who loves to spend time with my nieces and nephews. But that is very different from spending one on one time with my sister. Accept your sister's offer to spend some fun ADULT time at a place you both seem to enjoy. There are lots of parts of the Disney experience that are more enjoyable without kids. If you want to experience Disney World with your niece, why don't you take her for her birthday? It can become a fun tradition; maybe you can take Mara when she is old enough to appreciate it.", "YTA- either both girls go or neither of them go. Making a difference between the two is never the answer.", "YTA for all the reasons already listed by the other commenters, but I'd also like to point out that in general it is rude as hell to invite another person on a trip that you didn't arrange. If your sister wanted one or both of her children included, she would have included that information in her invite. Do you think it didn't occur to her that her children would enjoy going to Disney as well? This was obviously meant to just be a grown up trip. Why even muddy the waters this way? And when she objected, that should have been enough.", "YTA. Come on, you think a 4-y/o is going to understand that she couldn\u2019t come on the fun trip bc she\u2019s not fun enough for her uncle???\n\nYou ARE playing favorites, you\u2019re only thinking about your own wants/needs, and I hope your sister drops the polite act sooner than later and clues you in to what a dick you\u2019re being to her/your nieces.", "Yta your sister is right, it should just be the two of you and not the kids.", "YTA either both kids go or none. Basically punishing the little one for not being a carbon coby of her older sister is awful. Different people react differently to different situations and there is a big difference in age. Choosing to invite a Mom and only the \"kid you like\" is not okay.", "YTA\n\n\"Oh I totally don't favour Milly, I just want to treat her to a huge present and then get her to lie to her sister (who I don't actually like and have nothing planned for) about it.\"\n\nOP, your favouritism is palpable. Why don't you stop being an asshole, go with your sister and have a good adult time, instead of striving to pit children against each other while ignoring the nuclear fallout that will result?", "Your sister wanted just the two of you, and you added in one of her children. It's either the two of you or the four of you. If you want to spend time with the oldest aline, take her somewhere else.", "All of this is avoidable. Find something else to do for your birthday. Save Disney for your sister\u2019s birthday instead and she can decide who goes. \n\nBut major side-eye at the fact you wanted to encourage your niece to do something hurtful and also to lie about it to cover it up.", "YTA. Your sister is right. When Mara finds out that she wasn\u2019t invited, she will feel betrayed and hurting a young girl\u2019s feelings like that is beyond mean. Either go with both girls or neither of them.", "YTA. Like others have said, take both or none.\n\nSome of the problems you described are not really problems, if you are the parent. Because it's their kid, they most likely don't mind skipping rides for their kid. Yeah, they'd rather ride together, but it they'd sit it out for their kid (we did when our kids were little). If both parents want to experience it, I seem to remember they would let one parent sit it out and then when the other parent got back from the ride, they would let the other parent go (without having to wait in the long line again. Disney probably still does that.", "Yta at this age, the 4yo is gonna know that her sis went to Disney without her.  You could, however,  do an adult trip and not take either kid.", "YTA don\u2019t exclude kids from family events", "I feel like i'm taking crazy pills. You want to exclude a *4 year old* from disney world while taking along her sister, and you're asking if you're *wrong*? YTA", "I have nieces in the same phase as OP's situation, I get both the OP and OP's sister's side on the kids. We're all just hanging on in there waiting for the little on grow out of it lol\n\nThat said, OP, YTA for trying to hijack sister trip. If you dont want to spend adult time alone with your sister, just decline the trip.\n\nYou said you wanted to bring Milly because it would be more fun than doing the trip with just your sister. Thats kind of saying you prefer the company of her 7 year old to hers, isnt it", "YTA. Your sister wants to go on a trip with you. That was her proposal. Plus, she can\u2019t take one kid and leave the other behind. She will have to deal with the aftermath.", "YTA.  OP wants to destroy a four-year-old.  Nice!", "YTA. \"No\" is a word. You are welcome to say, \"This is my birthday, I want to go with just my partner,\" or \"This is my birthday, I want an adults-only trip.\" But the suggestion that you take one niece and not the other just sounds incredibly cruel to me.", "YTA leave both girls at home and go have fun with your sister. Take both girls in 3 years when Mara is 7 and Milly is 10", "Yes, YTA. You\u2019re only thinking of this from a pragmatic point of view, not from the point of view of a parent or of a young child watching Mom and big sis leave her behind to go somewhere she had fun too", "YTA. This sounded like it was just a trip for the grown ups. Your nieces already went a few months ago and you said yourself that Milly had a great time despite her sister\u2019s (albeit age appropriate) tantrums. If you want to take the kids back there, wait a few years so Mara can grow out of her tantrums and then go with your sister and the girls.", "I kind of think you suck for shaming her into bringing her eldest when she wanted to go have fun on her own.", "NAH here. You\u2019re sweet for thinking of your niece and, I think, can be excused for not thinking of the dynamic between the two sisters. Now you know that you should, yes? And you listened to your sister when she shot the idea down.\n\nYou\u2019re a bit dense for not figuring out your sister wanted a kids-free trip for once though, lol.", "Missing out on rides when you have a child is par for the course.  Even at 7, the older one may not feel up too it.  Just because she is an obedient child, does not mean she wants to go on every ride with you.  yta", "YTA. Both or neither, those are the only reasonable & kind choices you have here.", "That's just hateful.", "There\u2019s no way I can read this where it doesn\u2019t sound like you really like Milly and don\u2019t care so much for Mara. I also can\u2019t see how Mara wouldn\u2019t feel like she was left behind because she is the less favored child. If you do this, it\u2019s fairly certain that Mara will feel badly about herself, possibly in a big way. YTA", "Yta. She's 4 they are prone to tantrums. And it's unfair to bring one child and leave another home. \n\nYes a 7 yr old has a better control over their emotions so they will be better behaved.", "YTA. Hugely.", "YTA. No parent in their right mind would leave one kid behind. The parent guilt is too much and you obviously don\u2019t understand it not being the parent.", "YTA\n\nIt's really sad that you'd feel like an AH if you go without her, but you wouldn't feel like an AH leaving the other one behind. That's some sort of messed up morals you have there.", "I never  forgot  the first  time  I  was left behind  and  my mother  took my sister  to  a party  without  me. I can't  remember  what  I  had done  but I know  I  made her mad. So they left. I was just  a very little  girl  then and they were shocked  I remembered that.  It was because  the  feeling  of being  excluded  is real even  then.  Granted these days  I  would  rather  sit  at home  than go to any  kind  of  party  . Anyway, what you're  suggesting  is  bad. Take both or leave both. Don't  assume  she won't  remember  because  she's four. I sure did.", "YTA for suggesting to take one niece and not the other\n\nYour sister invited you two to go together. Do that \n\nHow do you think the 4 year old will feel when she finds out her sister went to Disney and she didn\u2019t?\n\nIt\u2019s fine you want to enjoy the rides together.  But the way to do that is by just the two adults going", "Info: did you sister intend to take both daughters before you said anything, or was it an adults trip?", "Don't do it. Can you just imagine the fury of a 4 year-old left out of Disney when her older sister went? It would be incredibly cruel and she'd never forgive any of you. YWBTA", "Yeah YTA. Some Mom\u2019s don\u2019t like to play favorites.", "YTA. Sorry, but it really is both the girls or neither of the girls. You're not the one who is going to have to deal with the fallout of the 4 year old being excluded from Disney.  Also, it's entirely possible that your sister wants to have an adults only trip to Disney with you, because it really is different when you don't have to take care of young children.", "YTA.  Your sister asked to go back just the two of you, presumably she does not want to bring either child in the first place and then you offering to just take one and not the other is dumb.  That's only going to cause conflict when there doesn't need to be any whatsoever. Either go on the trip without the kids or don't go at all.", "Your sister is dying for some 'adults only' time!\n\nIt's lovely that you think so highly of Milly, but just do your sis a solid and go have some grown-up fun!", "YTA. A 4 year old is self aware enough to know mom took her older sister to Disney and left her behind. That's just cruel. Either all the kids go, none, or you go on your own.", "NTA for suggesting it, but you will be if you insist. The mom said no because it's not fair. They are a package deal : either you take the 2 of them, or none.", "I'm confused about why you're creating this issue. Your sister suggested the two of you go for your birthday as in a sister bonding trip. Have you even considered the possibility your sister wants time without the girls? Why are you trying to include either child? \n\nGo with your sister, ride whatever you want, and avoid any possibilities of exclusion or tantrums. \n\nYTA for creating a problem where there isn't any.", "YTA. Just go with your sister. Idk why you would even bring up bringing one daughter let alone *not* bringing the other.", "YTA either take both or none.", "YTA, you\u2019re telling your sister you wouldn\u2019t enjoy going with just her, just be honest.", "YTA you can\u2019t leave one home like that. She\u2019s not a baby. All of your reasons are valid but\u2026, your sister wanted to go just you two so what\u2019s the problem with that. Kids would be fine and I\u2019m telling you , you will have a blast adulting around Disney!", "YTA. It sounds like your sister wanted a kid free trip, and now you\u2019re not only asking to bring her child, but to exclude the other one. You can\u2019t \u201cdrink around the world\u201d or do other fun adult activities with a 7 year old.", "Why don\u2019t you just both go together without the kids? I\u2019ve heard adults say it\u2019s so much fun tapping in their inner child whilst drinking cocktails lol", "YTA I don\u2019t even have kids and I know when you have multiple kids, you have to make everything equal. If you take one kid to disney world, you would have to find something equally as big and exciting for the other kid to do, and even then explaining to a 4 year old to wait for their turn to do a big fun activity like that, would be a challenge at best.", "Hire a nanny. That way you're both free to do as you please. YTA leaving one child behind absolutely sends a message to the little one.", "YWBTA. That doesn't mean you have to take Mara. Your sister suggested a trip for just you and her. Do that. You'll both feel guilty for not taking either of the kids, but that's better than taking just one and driving a wedge between them.", "YTA what are you 10 years old. your nieces are a package deal. why would you think it ok to take one without the other. thank goodness your sister has more sense.", "I'm gonna say YTA. Mara is 4 yrs old, ofc there'll be rides she can't go on or will be scared of. Likewise, there'll also be rides Milly can't go on or won't go on, which will impede you and your sister's chances. I took my 3 yr old to an amusement park this summer gone, and myself, my OH and SIL took turns doing wild rides for the 2 adults whilst one took the kids' rides with my son. Guess what? We still had fun! Either you accept a trip with both kids involved and where the adults can take turns with and without the kids, or just go alone with your sister as suggested. It's not nice or fair to exclude the youngest one for no real reason, plus it comes across that you favour the one over the other.", "Do yourself a favor and leave the kids home.", "I mean not an AH for suggesting it but ywbta if you don't accept your sister's answer. She's making a perfectly valid parenting choice and you should respect that.", "YTA, and you know what won't help Mara is picking up on your feelings towards her, and yes, she will absolutely understand what is happening even if she can't articulate it. \n\nWhen you start at a very young age, having to start to tiptoe around a grownups who claim to care about you, but it is obvious that those feelings are conditional on unrealized expectations you will be setting her up for a lifetime of that kind of dynamic.\n\nIf you adore Mara, then wouldn't you care about her happiness? Maybe she is too young for the trip, but that is not her fault, and you are punishing her for it.\n\nIf you really care about Mara, you will be honest with yourself that you are biased so you can be aware moving forward when it happens and how to deal with it. But if you continue to lie to yourself and the world, you will be doing so at the expense of a tour year old girl.", "YTA. Sister only wanted you to go. I would ask clarification questions just to make sure but it kinda sounds like she wants a you and her getaway.", "YTA. Your sister is right. If she brings one sibling, the other goes too.", "YTA\u2026 period", "YTA\n\nIt has to be either with or without both girls. With the girls you would have to plan the trip accordingly, so that the 4yo can manage/enjoy it as well. This is possible if you are willing to compromise. If not, enjoy the trip with adults only.\n\nYou don't have kids but maybe you do have siblings? How would you feel?", "YTA but you may be able to salvage this idea if you come up with an equal activity that is age appropriate for a 4yo for a different day. There are usually plenty of rides that are great for 4yos that you could ride with her on. Are they your first choice of rides? No. But when you have kids, it\u2019s about watching the joy and fun they can have as much as yourself. Propose a day just for the 4yo separately, like maybe a build-a-bear and ice cream day or something. Make it equal to try and keep it separate, and make it about the appropriate activity for each of their ages rather than making it about yourself.", "INFO: do they visit Disney theme parks often?

I have to imagine you don\u2019t have kids, because this would create major problems in your sister\u2019s household.\n\nYou and your sister should go on the trip without any kids.

It was fine to ask, but she already had the same thought process and decided on what would be best for both of her children. Mara WILL eventually find out, even if it's not right away, and she will feel betrayed and hurt by it. It's much easier an explanation to say it was an adult trip for your birthday than to explain the more complex reasons for why she was left behind, even if they're valid reasons it's still unfair on face value and she doesn't have the maturity for that kind of explanation and might never get over it if she internalizes it at a young age.", "YTA. Bring both or neither. You can\u2019t expect a child to overcome fears or learn to wait if you never bring them anywhere. Also, it sounds like your sister wants some adult, sisterly time away from her children. Edit: typo", "Nta for suggesting, but your sisters answer is correct.

I get you, but no, you can either take both girls and suck it up or take neither. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m pretty sure Disney has a decent rider system where one parent/carer can ride while the other waits with the kid and then they swap - look up rider switch.", "NAH\n\nFrom what I read: your sister invited you, you said her older daughter should come, she said no with a valid reason, and that was the end of it. \n\nIf you keep pushing, that\u2019s an asshole move.", "Just to clarify, both girls recently went to Disney but the little one didn't have a good time? So basically it's not her scene because, well, 4. Why would you be an AH for not forcing a child to go to a place she hated? \n\nWhat about other solutions? Like yes this is a birthday thing but for the kids it's really just a trip or an outing. So what if you did Disney with the older and then did another day at a place that the little would enjoy without her sister?  In essence, they both get a special mom/ aunt (uncle? I wasn't clear cuz I'm dumb) day without their sister and the adults get to enjoy time without a ton of meltdowns. Seems like a solution to me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNAH personally.

If any kids go she has to take both of her kids.", "Take both or none. Simple.\n\nI understand the 4 yo would impede on your activities in Disney World. At that age, their attention span and tolerance for most things is quite limited and it is annoying to say the least. I have a 5 yo and even being in store for 20 minutes is too much for her at times, especially if she gets nothing out of it. So, I completely understand the reasoning for not wanting to take her.\n\nHowever,  if to I am to be completely honest, it sounds like you favor the older child. Which I understand that as well. Older children can be more well behaved than the younger ones, making them more tolerable....sometimes.\n\nNTA, in my opinion. But maybe revisit the Disney World trip in a few years. The 4yo will be 7, maybe her unpredictable toddler-ness will have dissipated a bit, and you all could go together to have the time of your lives.", "YTA- you can bring both a couple years when they can enjoy all the attractions. Only bringing one bigger kid seems kind of mean to the smaller one.", "NTA\n\nBut if your sister wants to go just the two of you, then she may just want to go with you and without her daughters.

And then you could take the 4 year old once she is a bit older. I personally wouldn't have cared about this but I am not super sensitive.

Milly and Mara are 7 and 4yo respectively. They had so much fun my sister asked if the two of us could go for my birthday in a few months. \n\nI said sure but we should bring her older daughter, Milly, along because she's incredibly well behaved and loves Disney World above all things. I felt it would be an AH move to go without her since she would enjoy it more than both of us combined. **My sister said she couldn't do that because, while she'd feel like an AH going without Milly, she would feel like an even bigger AH taking Milly and leaving Mara behind. She said if Mara ever found out she would feel betrayed.**\n\nThe thing is, during their trip, Milly had the time of her life and was well behaved as usual. Mara also had fun (mainly at the hotel pool) but she is prone to tantrums and not only did she have multiple fits, she refused to go on about 90% of the rides because she was afraid (of the dark, of enclosed spaces, of loud noises, etc.). Of course, this probably isn't all too unusual for a 4yo. But my sister and her husband had to take turns missing rides so one of them could sit with Mara each time she didn't want to go on one.\n\nWhen my sister and I go I would like us to be able to ride whatever we please. Milly won't impede that goal, but Mara would.\n\nPlus I would genuinely enjoy having Milly there. She is hilarious and makes such outings fun. Frankly I would feel like an AH going without her.\n\nSo AITA for my suggestion that we should take Milly and leave Mara with her dad?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I grew up having to do what my brother wanted to do and he was older.

I mean your sister apparently wants to have an adult only fun time and apparently you missed the hint and immediately tried to get her to bring the older daughter along.

It almost sounds like you would have more fun with the 7yo alone then with your sister. YTA mildly for trying to push for the kid to come along.", "YTA\n\nYou can't invite one nice and not the other.

Why would you not take the children?", "YTA. \n\nFirst if all, unless Milly is incredibly tall for her age, there are definitely rides she will not be able to get on and thus, you'll miss out on. I'm also guessing that a 7-year-old would have much different taste in rides than you would. This coming from someone who just went to Disney a month ago with an 11, 9 and 4 year old. \n\nAlso, it sounds like your sister wants to go with just you. Perhaps she doesn't feel like being a mom that day? Having to worry about her kid, make sure she's fed, go for bathroom breaks, etc.", "YTA, did you consider maybe your sister would want a break from her kids?

It\u2019s the best. Even if the kid is an easier age like 7 where they can do a lot for themselves it\u2019s still limiting. She still might not wanna do what you guys want to do.\n\nEven though intellectually and practically  it seems like it makes sense that only the older one could go, it definitely would cause hurt and jealousy, as the 4 year old is old enough to know her big sister gets a trip she doesn\u2019t. This would be something that\u2019s brought up like 20 years later at the family get togethers. If the 4yo was a baby (like 2 yo or younger) you could get away with it but at this age it would be kinda cruel \n\nBut at the end of the day it\u2019s your birthday.

Also, this trip is supposed to be about you and your sis, and bringing your older niece along would detract from the bonding you could do with your sister over the trip.

If the event is intended to involve them, they should both be invited.", "No, it was an adult trip. But she said taking Milly wouldn't detract from the fun at all for her. She just refuses to do it because she knows Mara would feel hurt (and taking both girls definitely WOULD detract from the fun).", "[deleted]", "yeah, this sounds like the obvious solution.\n\nright now Mara isn't at a point where the main part of Disney (the rides) is fun for her. she'd have more fun having Daddy-daughter time at home. playing games. going to the park. whatever.\n\nand would have a blast if you and your sister did a special trip just her to say- a water park where she could have the pool day of her dreams while Milly hangs with Dad.", "It's definitely important that kids get one on one time with parents, and it's also important that kids learn they might not get to do everything. But it's also important to keep things generally fair while doing so.\n\nOp says that Disney isn't close to them - this means the trip will include plane tickets or a long car ride, time off work potentially, money for hotel rooms and eating out, cost of tickets, etc. And a lot of those things (hotel, plane, meals out) feel super super fun and special for kids. If Op and mom are willing to spend a similar amount of time and effort (and potentially but not necessarily money) to plan something equally as fun for Mara, then sure that's fine. \n\nBut if it's going to be \"Milly, you get to come with us to Disney! You get to ride on a plane, stay at a hotel, eat out, and go somewhere every kid dreams of!

Just because its your birthday doesn't mean you can be a jerk  to your four year old niece.", "Not when it means breaking her little niece's heart. You can't make something like that all right for a four year-old. When you have multiple kids, they keep score constantly right down to how many grapes the other got.

This is atrocious judgement on OP's part, when ALL factors are taken into account. YTA, OP.\n\nSure, technically, maybe one girl would cope better. And Milly would probably have fun again. That's the benefit. However, the FAR MORE SERIOUS cost, is a young child is intentionally excluded from DISNEYLAND (a place literally millions of children want to visit). \n\nWe're not talking about a trip to the supermarket here.

A place she was allowed to go previously, but now isn't wanted at. \n\nChildren tend to blame themselves in these situations, and interpret situations like this as reflective of their place in the family. They feel they aren't loved as much; that they aren't as important as their sibling; that the other sibling is the favourite, etc. That's highly distressing for them, and can do emotional damage. \n\nSo no. It's either take both siblings on a holiday like this, or take neither. Milly won't suffer anywhere near as much as Mara, by missing out on going for a second time.

Embarrassing that they think other people can't tell they have a favourite.", ">I still feel bad going somewhere like Disney World without the girls, but it's not fair to take one and not the other, whatever their ages. Perhaps we can all go again when they're older.\n\nThere's nothing to feel bad about. Parents can do things without their children. There's no reason you and your sister just can't go now. She just made the stipulation that if one kid goes, the other has to as well. That's parenting. And parenting a 4 year old, what do you expect? I think you should ask your mom how you were at 4 years old.", "You can't go out to eat with your sister because your nieces won't be there? Why does Disney have to be different?", "It's called parent swap. Every ride has it. One adult goes through the line, and the other adult waits outside. In the end, the other adult can go through the lightning lane at anytime of the day. You can still do all the rides. There are a lot of rides at Disney that are family-friendly that people flock to. It's a small world, Peter Pan's flight, jungle cruise, pirates of the caribbean, Dumbo's flying elephants, the spinning teacups, and buzz are a few. A four-year-old should also be tall enough to ride rides like Barnstormer.", "It's kind of weird to go to a theme park for kids without them imo. Like going to a playground full of kids and playing too as an adult.", "You are definitely an AH for that. Off course she\u2019ll find out. Do you really expect a kid to hold a Disney trip a secret from everyone else for the rest of her life? Imagine when your other niece found out you took her sister on that trip and held it a secret for years! \nYou could always do a Disney trip with the oldest and another trip with the youngest since you don\u2019t live nearby. For instance take the same amount of days to a hotel with a pool or with activities more for her age?", "Because she was too young!", "We took our 5 and 7 yr olds many yrs ago and our 5 yr has the faintest of memories of it. Generally I think the whole making memories Disney advertising is complete bs for kids under 6 and is a just plain money grabber", "Treating children exactly the same instead of the individual that they are makes you even more of an AH.  Also as it's an Aunt,  it's her time and money,  she is NOT obligated to do jack shit with either kid,", "She's a single mom.", "Kind of? The kids just went to Disney, it\u2019s not like the older one would be missing out on a big opportunity. And this would be blatantly favoring one of them. If you want to go with the kids go with them when they\u2019re a little older. Just taking one of them is going to hurt feelings.", "NTA but very bad idea. Unless is for a birthday or in recognition of an acheivement or something like that  you can't give one sibling a treat without giving the other. Siblings will see that as blatant favouritism and will cause holy hell. If the four year old saw the seven year old go to literal disney world and she got left behind your sister would never hear the end of it.  Especially since it's not a celebration that affects either child. It's their aunt's birthday.  Either both children should go or neither of them", "You could all go, but leave dad at the hotel to play with Mara in the pool all day.", "It's absolutely an asshole idea! That's like top tier asshole. She doesn't like scary rides or standing in long lines, but Disney has a ton of other things to do and see! She's 4. Don't push the issue. Go and have fun with the adults.", "It's fine to propose the idea, but she said no.\n\nMove on and enjoy a trip with your sister doing adult things", "It is an AH idea to take one niece and leave the other behind. If you want to take your niece, wait a year or two and take both girls.", "Either both kids or neither kid goes.  Full stop.  \n\nBTW, didn\u2019t they do baby swaps? The older kid gets to ride twice, because they don\u2019t make the second adult ride alone. My adult kids still remember that joy!", "Yes.  Inviting one child and leaving the other is something an asshole would do.  Yes.  She would be crushed.  Have you ever tried looking at something from someone else's point of view?", "Yes, it's an AH idea. \n\nBring both (and have Dad stay back with the younger one when she wants to hang out at the pool or sit out a ride since the trip is really about you and sis) or neither.", "The fact that OP has a sister herself and never thought how 7/4 yo her would respond to this. Then says her sister told her what a normal person with two kids would say. THEN posts on Reddit because they still don't understand the concept is actually weird. If they were an only child not around other children often maybe. But it is common sense you don't favor one child over the other and they still need to be told by the internet. You don't think that's weird at all?", "Exactly. My 10 year old went on Tron multiple times but Tower of Terror was a big ol nope!", "They are not assuming, it states it in the post that the oldest daughter wanted and good go on all the rides but her sister freaked out and they had to take turns.", "My daughter who is tall, at 7 wasn\u2019t tall enough for all the rides.", "This was going to by my suggestion. I come from a pretty big family and there were definitely  times when my parents split up activities for convenience and practicality. Doing separate activities/days not only helps alleviate the potential issue of splitting up rides, but also gives them individual attention\n\nETA: why not do this as a sister trip and then identify special activities for both girls based on their interests? You said Mara likes boards games, is there a board game restaurant near you? Then maybe take Milly to a smaller park that has mini-golf, etc.", "No, we're nowhere near Disney World. It would take forever just to coordinate our schedules and plan out one trip.\n\nPlus I don't think Mara is really the right age for Disney World. The Milly trip would be Disney and the Mara trip would be...a hotel with a swimming pool probably. Which is doable but it doesn't seem quite equal/fair. And we would still have the whole \"you went to Disney without me\" issue with Mara.", "I can't buy her anything that would compare to the idea of Disney World. It's probably best to leave both girls at home this time and plan a trip with both when they're older.", "Not at fucking Disney World. Taking Milly to the park or the zoo is fine, but you don't go on a whole vacation to \"the most magical place in the world\" and leave just one of your kids behind. It's plain mean.", "[deleted]", "No. If you have 3 people they just get in to the car behind you if it's 2 seater rides. If not, usually a family of four can sit in a row. No one gets left behind.", "[deleted]", "By 24 I expect a certain level of maturity that is seriously lacking in these responses. Without any age context I would have thought the OP was mid teen range like 15ish.", "Don't give her a pass. 24 is more than old enough to know offering to take one niece and not the other to Disney would be playing favorites and be the dumbest offer to make.", "[deleted]", "So I was thinking Milly could keep it to herself but apparently that's not feasible.", "She was afraid of it's a small world. They had to push and push before she finally relented (and ended up loving it, but was even more resistant for every ride that followed).", "I know people who go to Disney World a lot on their own, now they do live right near it so they get a discount but still. It's a theme park...adults like Disney too.\n\nEdit to add: Also in general adults like theme parks and are allowed to enjoy them...they aren't for children only. I would love to go to a theme park just my husband and I sometimes but I would probably not do that because my child would feel so left out.", "There's lots at Disney that's aimed at adults though. There's a whole food and wine festival during part of the year, for example.", "That not what 5 yo Mara will think or 6 yo Mara.  Even worse is that she has already been there and had fun, so no, she isn't going to understand that she is suddenly too young when she could go before.", "Kids don't get that though. Kids don't have the reasoning skills to think \"Oh, of course my aunt want to take my older sister - she's better behaved and more able to appreciate this experience!\" \nMara will only, ONLY, understand that her mom and aunt excluded her from a fun trip.", "Treating children differently, if it strongly risks them suffering emotionally, makes you an AH. I don't think you're considering the complexity of that. There's a whole spectrum of 'treating children differently'. \n\nIt starts with always and completely ignoring and favouring one child - and runs up to always treating them exactly the same in everything. Either extreme is damaging.  But for most people, treating children differently falls somewhere along that spectrum. It has to be judged, weighing up the pluses and minuses of each individual situation. \n\nAnd since the youngest child is likely to unnecessarily suffer emotional harm, vs. what the sister would 'suffer' by not going, it ISN'T justified to treat them differently on this occasion.\nAnd just because you don't have a finnacial obligation to either child, it doesn't mean you get to do what you want (and be an asshole) in relation to children. \n\nIf you want the benefit of contact with children, you take their emotions into account when having that contact with them. You can't just do what you want. And indeed, you have to consider the parents' wishes, also. Your birthday doesn't outweigh the mother's (legitimate) concern about her youngest's feelings.", "I'm curious why you would use nta here. Nta implies the other party is the asshole so how would the sister be the asshole here?  Everything you'd said is what the sister said.", " Guaranteed they were talking about all the kid rides.", "Yeah my 6 year old is nowhere near 48 inches.", "Oh sorry, I didn't mean two Disney trips! I meant \"We're taking both of you girls on your own trips!\" and then tailor Mara's trip to her. I know taking 2 Disney trips would be insanely expensive but could you do a day at the zoo or something that she goes crazy for?\n\nLike the \"perfect\" day for a 4 year old! Heck, even staying in a motel was considered a fun and amazing time at that age for me! Breakfast in bed, day at the zoo/beach/smaller theme park, her favourite place for dinner etc?\n\nAs for *\"You got to go to Disney without me!\" \"Yes and you got to do X without Milly!\"* \n\nBut honestly if your sister doesn't think there's a peaceful way to take just 1, then I wouldn't push it further", "This sounds exactly like our trip to Disney with my niece and nephew.  Niece has a blast, nephew was scared of everything, whined, and only wanted to go to the pool. Luckily he had a parent there too that could just sit with him, but it made it a lot less fun for everyone.  We wanted to go to Dollywood this year and decided just my niece and her parents would go with us. Nephew got a day of doing whatever he wanted with the grandparents and he was overjoyed.  He knew he would hate the amusement park, so he had a great day going to the pool and playing on his tablet at the hotel instead.\n\nAnd yea...the Avatar ride is amazing!!!!", "Trips don't have to be fair, just catered to the invidual. \n\nMy oldest loves trampoline park but my 4yr is too young so we do painting pottery instead.", "Maybe a trip to one of those hotel swimming parks for Mara like the Great Wolf Lodge.", "YTA you don\u2019t get to decide for someone else how they parent or entertain their kids. Your sister asked you and you only for the trip which means she already decided that *both* Mara and Milly were not going. You don\u2019t get to add the +1, even if it\u2019s her own daughter. \n\nAlso, 4 year old, no matter the temperament, is old enough to know when another sibling is being favored with something extra - be it an extra scoop of ice cream, or an extra toy. An extra trip with just Mommy and you is something she is absolutely going to remember and it will affect her relationship with all of you. You thought she was temperamental? She will act out even worse because she doesn\u2019t understand yet why she is being excluded. Kids at that age (I have a 3.5 myself) are still learning to self-regulate themselves in terms of what they want/ how they feel. When they want something, or feel something, they only know focus on that one feeling/emotion and can be quickly consumed by it - it\u2019s hard for them to distract themselves or understand why their parents are denying them something in the moment, especially when overtired. And I can see the younger sister easily being overtired and overwhelmed a lot on a trip where she is trying to keep up with everyone else and older sister, because of FOMO. So also give her some grace on her bad behavior.", "That might be best. I get your logic and you may not see it as favouring but Mara would likely see it as \u201cOp doesn\u2019t like me as much\u201d if you can\u2019t make it equal.", "I highly recommend the book, Siblings Without Rivalry, for your sister (and you) as it helps with identifying for adults how to treat siblings equitably, not identically. \n\nIt also teaches adults how to share the concept of equity to kids. Understanding that concept helps kids feel like they\u2019re receiving fair treatment, even when they don\u2019t get exactly the same thing or amount of a thing, as their sibling. \n\nKnowing that your individual needs and wants will be recognized and met reliably, takes away a lot of the hurt feelings which contribute to sibling rivalry.", "I agree with this. Leaving Mara home is seriously fucking mean, she\u2019s not a toddler.", "Your sister isn't going to leave one child home and take the other on vacation. \n\nIt's not all glamorous and my god it's a 4 year old. Tell your sister that that Mara can go but your sister needs to be responsible for Mara's tantrums and sitting out on rides as the parent. \n\nOr here's a crazy idea. Just make it a sister trip.", "I would leave Milly home and go with your sister. You can always plan another trip with the girls when Mara is older and able to enjoy the trip.", "It\u2019s unfair to set up that dynamic between the kids even if the younger kid is still a bit immature you\u2019re still favoring your older niece. Your sister is right it\u2019s either no kids or both", "You cannot POSSIBLY expect your sister to bring one of her kids to Disneyworld and purposely leave the other at home. That would just be cruel.", "Who is supposed to pay for Milly?", "It\u2019s never as fun to be the person stuck in the seat by yourself.  It totally changes the experience having a third person there", "So\u2026 cars of 4, where you\u2019re a group but not actually together? (Genuine question - I\u2019ve always wondered)", "But she's a \"delight\" at board games, LOL.", "Yeah sure you don\u2019t sound like you have favorites", "The way you talk about a four year old holding a grudge makes you sound deranged.", "I assumed 24, male by the lack of awareness of family dynamics, and was wrong there. Admittedly, it\u2019s unfair to ask that women be more aware of familial situations in general, I would think she might have been able to see a little of herself, and how she would have felt, in the niece being left behind.\n\nThat said, my other guess is she (OP) was raised as a golden child and sees separating children for fun as acceptable/normal, same as telling the golden of the nieces to lie to cover up that she\u2019s getting special treatment; if that was her childhood, she\u2019s just passing on that generational trauma*TM*", "How the hell is that fair to Milly, though? Even if a 7 year old could successfully keep a secret this big, think of that little girl's guilt!", "How does that conversation when you tell the 7 yo that she has to lie to her sister?", "Come on, man, I\u2019m trying to be with you on this but you\u2019re also going to encourage your favorite niece to lie and obfuscate the truth?? Maybe neither of those kids need to be around you until you reflect on your wants vs the needs of others, and do some growing up.", "It\u2019s not only not feasible, you\u2019re setting up the seven year old for a lifetime of problems with her younger sister\u2014and you. Kids have long memories. Do you want to be known as the aunt who didn\u2019t take Mara to Disney for the rest of your life? Because I can guarantee you that it will be brought up at every family event for the rest of her life\u2014and justifiably so. Either do a sister only trip, or wait until Mara is a bit older and all four of you go. That would be a memory worth having consistently brought up. \n\nAnd YTA for making your sister even think about this decision. How would you have felt when you were a kid if one of your siblings went to Disney and you had to stay home?", "Haha no. That would never happen. Even if it did short term, it would still come out eventually. That's how lies work - the truth always comes out. Especially with kids.", "Have you ever seen a 7 year old try to keep a secret?", "How old are you?", "Op also wants them to keep it a secret so technically lie to the child. As soon as those kids get into a spat they are so going to throw this out to hurt the other one.", "I mean, OP asked if they were the asshole. I\u2019m saying no they are not. I don\u2019t see where that implies that OP\u2019s sister was an asshole. Those are two separate statements.  I could have used NAH but I wanted to express that while OP is not an AH, they did propose a bad idea.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "\u2026but she\u2019s not gonna keep score that her sister has been to Disney twice, and her only once\u2026", "It probably sounds different when people who are fond of her say it.", "Those are vastly different lies.", "Why do you hate Mara so much? She is a 4 year old little girl! This is normal for a child her age!", "Mara is 4. All the behaviors that you are describing are age-appropriate and something that nearly all 4-year-olds go through.\n\nAlso, asking your niece to lie because it is convenient for you? Not the greatest behavior modeling, my dude.", "WTH is wrong with you. You want to make a 7 year old lie about taking a trip and you think that's the same as encouraging her sister about her art. Please whatever you do don't have children, at least until you grow up. You are willing to destroy these sisters bond just to have some fun. Your a horrible Aunt. If I was your sister and I read this. I would not let you be around either of my kids going forward.", "SO teaching your niece it's ok to lie in life when it benefits just themselves???? Bullshit! Grow Up! Imagine how you would have felt if your sister got a trip like this and you didn't at that age."]}
