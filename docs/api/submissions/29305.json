{"id": 29305, "submission_id": "17cf8rt", "title": "AITA for suggesting we leave my 4yo niece home when we go to Disney World?", "selftext": "My sister went to Disney World with her husband and two daughters...let's call them Milly and Mara. Milly and Mara are 7 and 4yo respectively. They had so much fun my sister asked if the two of us could go for my birthday in a few months. \n\nI said sure but we should bring her older daughter, Milly, along because she's incredibly well behaved and loves Disney World above all things. I felt it would be an AH move to go without her since she would enjoy it more than both of us combined. **My sister said she couldn't do that because, while she'd feel like an AH going without Milly, she would feel like an even bigger AH taking Milly and leaving Mara behind. She said if Mara ever found out she would feel betrayed.**\n\nThe thing is, during their trip, Milly had the time of her life and was well behaved as usual. Mara also had fun (mainly at the hotel pool) but she is prone to tantrums and not only did she have multiple fits, she refused to go on about 90% of the rides because she was afraid (of the dark, of enclosed spaces, of loud noises, etc.). Of course, this probably isn't all too unusual for a 4yo. But my sister and her husband had to take turns missing rides so one of them could sit with Mara each time she didn't want to go on one.\n\nWhen my sister and I go I would like us to be able to ride whatever we please. Milly won't impede that goal, but Mara would.\n\nPlus I would genuinely enjoy having Milly there. She is hilarious and makes such outings fun. Frankly I would feel like an AH going without her.\n\nSo AITA for my suggestion that we should take Milly and leave Mara with her dad?\n\n**EDIT:** I know I sound like I favor Milly here but I truly adore both girls. It's just that one of them can tolerate waiting in a long line, and even make it fun, while the other does better in more structured/less crowded settings (Mara, for example, is a delight when playing board games). I just wanted to clarify that I really do love them equally.", "created_utc": 1697819079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17cf8rt/aita_for_suggesting_we_leave_my_4yo_niece_home/", "score": 2182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Could it be because she wants to actually enjoy Disney World with you and not have to worry about supervising her kids?", "INFO - Have you asked your sister what her expectations of the trip are?", "YTA.  It sounds like your sister's suggestion was for the two of you to go, not for you two plus a child.  Go and leave both kids home.  It's not your responsibility to entertain the older kid with a trip to Mickey, it's her parents'.", "YTA.  Leave them both home.  (Or take them both) Why did you have to complicate a simple outing with your sister with this suggestion that will cause problems with her children ?   Your sister is correct. They\u2019re too young to understand", "YTA - This was just supposed to be a trip for you and your sister, yes? Then don\u2019t involve the kids at all! By telling your sister to bring one girl and not the other, you\u2019re sending a message even if you don\u2019t mean to. Mara will feel there\u2019s something wrong with her because her sister was invited to a fun birthday party with her mom and aunt/uncle, but she wasn\u2019t.\n\nYou\u2019\u2019re creating a problem and a wedge that don\u2019t need to exist. Just have the outing with your sister. If you want to spend time with Milly at the park, go another time when the whole family can enjoy it.", "YTA. Either bring both or leave both at home. There's no way the 4 yo isn't going to find out (her sister can't be expected to lie or stay quiet) so she will definitely be upset. How do you intend to explain without telling her that she isn't welcome and you don't want her around?", "YTA Your sister isn't going to take one of her children to Disney and leave the other one home. It was not a reasonable suggestion for you to make.", "YTA. You take both or neither. Obviously you don\u2019t have kids.", "It sounds like your sister asked only two of you should go, if so YTA for suggesting to take her one kid and leave one behind. Some kids might not behave as good as their siblings but that's not a reason to leave them behind while taking the other child, leave both behind.", "YTA. How exactly did you expect your sister to explain this to your niece??", "YTA. First of all, Mara acted very much like a normal 4 year old on the trip. Your post seems to imply that Mara was being bad or a annoyance, but not wanting to go on intense or scary rides is a totally normal thing for a four year old. And sometimes having a meltdown in a crowded, unfamiliar place is totally normal for a four year old. When you take your very young child to an amusement park, you sign on for those things. \n\nSecond, four years old is old enough to know when you're being excluded. You want Mara to sit at home, knowing her sister is out having fun with her mom and aunt? Because that's what would happen. Its also a great way to start breeding resentment between sisters. \n\nEither take both girls or don't take either. I'm sure there's a way to frame it to Milly that its a special trip for you and her mom. It is way more fair for both girls to be disappointed, then for one girl to get a super awesome trip and the other girl to get nothing.", "YWBTA if you only took one of the girls. it would be unfair.\n\nThe sensible thing to do is not to take either and just the 2 of you go.", "YTA. Your sister suggested a sisters-only trip. Why not just leave it at that and go as two adults? Why even suggest you take just one sibling? I know that your motivation is to enjoy the time, and you know that you'd enjoy it with Milly there but not with Mara there--how do you think Mara's going to feel when she finds out? How do you think that will affect your relationship with her? You love them equally, but your actions imply otherwise to Mara, who would be left out of the trip only because she displays standard 4yo behavior. Go just the two of you, or wait until Mara's older so she can also go.", "YTA - She wants it to be just the two of you. She wants an adults weekend where she gets some time off from parenting. Of course she is not going to bring one of her kids and not the other. It\u2019s a ridiculous thing to ask.\n\nAnd whilst Molly might be a delight for you, what awaits your sister when she gets back is going be utterly awful for her and for Mara as well. Are you going to deal with the fallout from that?\n\nMara will not understand being abandoned especially when it\u2019s Disneyworld, a place that, whilst enjoyable for all ages was designed for children.", "100% YTA here and your sister is an Olympic Class great mom.  When Milly comes home babbling about the fantastic time she had with you and her mom at Disney how, exactly, do you think Mara is going to feel?  I'm sure she'll run into plenty of mean girls in school throughout her life-- she doesn't really need one in her own family.", "YTA asking your sister to leave her child behind", "YTA. Neither girl should be invited on this birthday trip. If the event is intended to involve them, they should both be invited.", "YTA, I understand not wanting to miss out on rides, but that's probably why your sister suggested that just the two of you should go. Either go with your sister or invite both of your nieces.", "YTA Its either both or none.", "How about just an adult sibling trip.. that way no child has to be hurt or left behind. \n\nMom should refuse the trip if only one child is invited and other not..\n\nThat\u2019s an Ahole move..", "How lucky you are to have a sister who wants to celebrate such a fun experience with you for your birthday. I'm an aunt who loves to spend time with my nieces and nephews. But that is very different from spending one on one time with my sister. Accept your sister's offer to spend some fun ADULT time at a place you both seem to enjoy. There are lots of parts of the Disney experience that are more enjoyable without kids. If you want to experience Disney World with your niece, why don't you take her for her birthday? It can become a fun tradition; maybe you can take Mara when she is old enough to appreciate it.", "YTA- either both girls go or neither of them go. Making a difference between the two is never the answer.", "YTA for all the reasons already listed by the other commenters, but I'd also like to point out that in general it is rude as hell to invite another person on a trip that you didn't arrange. If your sister wanted one or both of her children included, she would have included that information in her invite. Do you think it didn't occur to her that her children would enjoy going to Disney as well? This was obviously meant to just be a grown up trip. Why even muddy the waters this way? And when she objected, that should have been enough.", "YTA. Come on, you think a 4-y/o is going to understand that she couldn\u2019t come on the fun trip bc she\u2019s not fun enough for her uncle???\n\nYou ARE playing favorites, you\u2019re only thinking about your own wants/needs, and I hope your sister drops the polite act sooner than later and clues you in to what a dick you\u2019re being to her/your nieces.", "Yta your sister is right, it should just be the two of you and not the kids.", "YTA either both kids go or none. Basically punishing the little one for not being a carbon coby of her older sister is awful. Different people react differently to different situations and there is a big difference in age. Choosing to invite a Mom and only the \"kid you like\" is not okay.", "YTA\n\n\"Oh I totally don't favour Milly, I just want to treat her to a huge present and then get her to lie to her sister (who I don't actually like and have nothing planned for) about it.\"\n\nOP, your favouritism is palpable. Why don't you stop being an asshole, go with your sister and have a good adult time, instead of striving to pit children against each other while ignoring the nuclear fallout that will result?", "Your sister wanted just the two of you, and you added in one of her children. It's either the two of you or the four of you. If you want to spend time with the oldest aline, take her somewhere else.", "All of this is avoidable. Find something else to do for your birthday. Save Disney for your sister\u2019s birthday instead and she can decide who goes. \n\nBut major side-eye at the fact you wanted to encourage your niece to do something hurtful and also to lie about it to cover it up.", "YTA. Your sister is right. When Mara finds out that she wasn\u2019t invited, she will feel betrayed and hurting a young girl\u2019s feelings like that is beyond mean. Either go with both girls or neither of them.", "YTA. Like others have said, take both or none.\n\nSome of the problems you described are not really problems, if you are the parent. Because it's their kid, they most likely don't mind skipping rides for their kid. Yeah, they'd rather ride together, but it they'd sit it out for their kid (we did when our kids were little). If both parents want to experience it, I seem to remember they would let one parent sit it out and then when the other parent got back from the ride, they would let the other parent go (without having to wait in the long line again. Disney probably still does that.", "Yta at this age, the 4yo is gonna know that her sis went to Disney without her.  You could, however,  do an adult trip and not take either kid.", "YTA don\u2019t exclude kids from family events", "I feel like i'm taking crazy pills. You want to exclude a *4 year old* from disney world while taking along her sister, and you're asking if you're *wrong*? YTA", "I have nieces in the same phase as OP's situation, I get both the OP and OP's sister's side on the kids. We're all just hanging on in there waiting for the little on grow out of it lol\n\nThat said, OP, YTA for trying to hijack sister trip. If you dont want to spend adult time alone with your sister, just decline the trip.\n\nYou said you wanted to bring Milly because it would be more fun than doing the trip with just your sister. Thats kind of saying you prefer the company of her 7 year old to hers, isnt it", "YTA. Your sister wants to go on a trip with you. That was her proposal. Plus, she can\u2019t take one kid and leave the other behind. She will have to deal with the aftermath.", "YTA.  OP wants to destroy a four-year-old.  Nice!", "YTA. \"No\" is a word. You are welcome to say, \"This is my birthday, I want to go with just my partner,\" or \"This is my birthday, I want an adults-only trip.\" But the suggestion that you take one niece and not the other just sounds incredibly cruel to me.", "YTA leave both girls at home and go have fun with your sister. Take both girls in 3 years when Mara is 7 and Milly is 10", "Yes, YTA. You\u2019re only thinking of this from a pragmatic point of view, not from the point of view of a parent or of a young child watching Mom and big sis leave her behind to go somewhere she had fun too", "YTA. This sounded like it was just a trip for the grown ups. Your nieces already went a few months ago and you said yourself that Milly had a great time despite her sister\u2019s (albeit age appropriate) tantrums. If you want to take the kids back there, wait a few years so Mara can grow out of her tantrums and then go with your sister and the girls.", "I kind of think you suck for shaming her into bringing her eldest when she wanted to go have fun on her own.", "NAH here. You\u2019re sweet for thinking of your niece and, I think, can be excused for not thinking of the dynamic between the two sisters. Now you know that you should, yes? And you listened to your sister when she shot the idea down.\n\nYou\u2019re a bit dense for not figuring out your sister wanted a kids-free trip for once though, lol.", "Missing out on rides when you have a child is par for the course.  Even at 7, the older one may not feel up too it.  Just because she is an obedient child, does not mean she wants to go on every ride with you.  yta", "YTA. Both or neither, those are the only reasonable & kind choices you have here.", "That's just hateful.", "There\u2019s no way I can read this where it doesn\u2019t sound like you really like Milly and don\u2019t care so much for Mara. I also can\u2019t see how Mara wouldn\u2019t feel like she was left behind because she is the less favored child. If you do this, it\u2019s fairly certain that Mara will feel badly about herself, possibly in a big way. YTA", "Yta. She's 4 they are prone to tantrums. And it's unfair to bring one child and leave another home. \n\nYes a 7 yr old has a better control over their emotions so they will be better behaved.", "YTA. Hugely.", "YTA. No parent in their right mind would leave one kid behind. The parent guilt is too much and you obviously don\u2019t understand it not being the parent.", "YTA\n\nIt's really sad that you'd feel like an AH if you go without her, but you wouldn't feel like an AH leaving the other one behind. That's some sort of messed up morals you have there.", "I never  forgot  the first  time  I  was left behind  and  my mother  took my sister  to  a party  without  me. I can't  remember  what  I  had done  but I know  I  made her mad. So they left. I was just  a very little  girl  then and they were shocked  I remembered that.  It was because  the  feeling  of being  excluded  is real even  then.  Granted these days  I  would  rather  sit  at home  than go to any  kind  of  party  . Anyway, what you're  suggesting  is  bad. Take both or leave both. Don't  assume  she won't  remember  because  she's four. I sure did.", "YTA for suggesting to take one niece and not the other\n\nYour sister invited you two to go together. Do that \n\nHow do you think the 4 year old will feel when she finds out her sister went to Disney and she didn\u2019t?\n\nIt\u2019s fine you want to enjoy the rides together.  But the way to do that is by just the two adults going", "Info: did you sister intend to take both daughters before you said anything, or was it an adults trip?", "Don't do it. Can you just imagine the fury of a 4 year-old left out of Disney when her older sister went? It would be incredibly cruel and she'd never forgive any of you. YWBTA", "Yeah YTA. Some Mom\u2019s don\u2019t like to play favorites.", "YTA. Sorry, but it really is both the girls or neither of the girls. You're not the one who is going to have to deal with the fallout of the 4 year old being excluded from Disney.  Also, it's entirely possible that your sister wants to have an adults only trip to Disney with you, because it really is different when you don't have to take care of young children.", "YTA.  Your sister asked to go back just the two of you, presumably she does not want to bring either child in the first place and then you offering to just take one and not the other is dumb.  That's only going to cause conflict when there doesn't need to be any whatsoever. Either go on the trip without the kids or don't go at all.", "Your sister is dying for some 'adults only' time!\n\nIt's lovely that you think so highly of Milly, but just do your sis a solid and go have some grown-up fun!", "YTA. A 4 year old is self aware enough to know mom took her older sister to Disney and left her behind. That's just cruel. Either all the kids go, none, or you go on your own.", "NTA for suggesting it, but you will be if you insist. The mom said no because it's not fair. They are a package deal : either you take the 2 of them, or none.", "I'm confused about why you're creating this issue. Your sister suggested the two of you go for your birthday as in a sister bonding trip. Have you even considered the possibility your sister wants time without the girls? Why are you trying to include either child? \n\nGo with your sister, ride whatever you want, and avoid any possibilities of exclusion or tantrums. \n\nYTA for creating a problem where there isn't any.", "YTA. Just go with your sister. Idk why you would even bring up bringing one daughter let alone *not* bringing the other.", "YTA either take both or none.", "YTA, you\u2019re telling your sister you wouldn\u2019t enjoy going with just her, just be honest.", "YTA you can\u2019t leave one home like that. She\u2019s not a baby. All of your reasons are valid but\u2026, your sister wanted to go just you two so what\u2019s the problem with that. Kids would be fine and I\u2019m telling you , you will have a blast adulting around Disney!", "YTA. It sounds like your sister wanted a kid free trip, and now you\u2019re not only asking to bring her child, but to exclude the other one. You can\u2019t \u201cdrink around the world\u201d or do other fun adult activities with a 7 year old.", "Why don\u2019t you just both go together without the kids? I\u2019ve heard adults say it\u2019s so much fun tapping in their inner child whilst drinking cocktails lol", "YTA I don\u2019t even have kids and I know when you have multiple kids, you have to make everything equal. If you take one kid to disney world, you would have to find something equally as big and exciting for the other kid to do, and even then explaining to a 4 year old to wait for their turn to do a big fun activity like that, would be a challenge at best.", "Hire a nanny. That way you're both free to do as you please. YTA leaving one child behind absolutely sends a message to the little one.", "YWBTA. That doesn't mean you have to take Mara. Your sister suggested a trip for just you and her. Do that. You'll both feel guilty for not taking either of the kids, but that's better than taking just one and driving a wedge between them.", "YTA what are you 10 years old. your nieces are a package deal. why would you think it ok to take one without the other. thank goodness your sister has more sense.", "I'm gonna say YTA. Mara is 4 yrs old, ofc there'll be rides she can't go on or will be scared of. Likewise, there'll also be rides Milly can't go on or won't go on, which will impede you and your sister's chances. I took my 3 yr old to an amusement park this summer gone, and myself, my OH and SIL took turns doing wild rides for the 2 adults whilst one took the kids' rides with my son. Guess what? We still had fun! Either you accept a trip with both kids involved and where the adults can take turns with and without the kids, or just go alone with your sister as suggested. It's not nice or fair to exclude the youngest one for no real reason, plus it comes across that you favour the one over the other.", "Do yourself a favor and leave the kids home.", "I mean not an AH for suggesting it but ywbta if you don't accept your sister's answer. She's making a perfectly valid parenting choice and you should respect that.", "YTA, and you know what won't help Mara is picking up on your feelings towards her, and yes, she will absolutely understand what is happening even if she can't articulate it. \n\nWhen you start at a very young age, having to start to tiptoe around a grownups who claim to care about you, but it is obvious that those feelings are conditional on unrealized expectations you will be setting her up for a lifetime of that kind of dynamic.\n\nIf you adore Mara, then wouldn't you care about her happiness? Maybe she is too young for the trip, but that is not her fault, and you are punishing her for it.\n\nIf you really care about Mara, you will be honest with yourself that you are biased so you can be aware moving forward when it happens and how to deal with it. But if you continue to lie to yourself and the world, you will be doing so at the expense of a tour year old girl.", "YTA. Sister only wanted you to go. I would ask clarification questions just to make sure but it kinda sounds like she wants a you and her getaway.", "YTA. Your sister is right. If she brings one sibling, the other goes too.", "YTA\u2026 period", "YTA\n\nIt has to be either with or without both girls. With the girls you would have to plan the trip accordingly, so that the 4yo can manage/enjoy it as well. This is possible if you are willing to compromise. If not, enjoy the trip with adults only.\n\nYou don't have kids but maybe you do have siblings? How would you feel?", "YTA but you may be able to salvage this idea if you come up with an equal activity that is age appropriate for a 4yo for a different day. There are usually plenty of rides that are great for 4yos that you could ride with her on. Are they your first choice of rides? No. But when you have kids, it\u2019s about watching the joy and fun they can have as much as yourself. Propose a day just for the 4yo separately, like maybe a build-a-bear and ice cream day or something. Make it equal to try and keep it separate, and make it about the appropriate activity for each of their ages rather than making it about yourself.", "INFO: do they visit Disney theme parks often?

I have to imagine you don\u2019t have kids, because this would create major problems in your sister\u2019s household.\n\nYou and your sister should go on the trip without any kids.

It was fine to ask, but she already had the same thought process and decided on what would be best for both of her children. Mara WILL eventually find out, even if it's not right away, and she will feel betrayed and hurt by it. It's much easier an explanation to say it was an adult trip for your birthday than to explain the more complex reasons for why she was left behind, even if they're valid reasons it's still unfair on face value and she doesn't have the maturity for that kind of explanation and might never get over it if she internalizes it at a young age.", "YTA. Bring both or neither. You can\u2019t expect a child to overcome fears or learn to wait if you never bring them anywhere. Also, it sounds like your sister wants some adult, sisterly time away from her children. Edit: typo", "Nta for suggesting, but your sisters answer is correct.

I get you, but no, you can either take both girls and suck it up or take neither. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m pretty sure Disney has a decent rider system where one parent/carer can ride while the other waits with the kid and then they swap - look up rider switch.", "NAH\n\nFrom what I read: your sister invited you, you said her older daughter should come, she said no with a valid reason, and that was the end of it. \n\nIf you keep pushing, that\u2019s an asshole move.", "Just to clarify, both girls recently went to Disney but the little one didn't have a good time? So basically it's not her scene because, well, 4. Why would you be an AH for not forcing a child to go to a place she hated? \n\nWhat about other solutions? Like yes this is a birthday thing but for the kids it's really just a trip or an outing. So what if you did Disney with the older and then did another day at a place that the little would enjoy without her sister?  In essence, they both get a special mom/ aunt (uncle? I wasn't clear cuz I'm dumb) day without their sister and the adults get to enjoy time without a ton of meltdowns. Seems like a solution to me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nNAH personally. I get where everyone is coming from, I just think y'all are thinking too black and white for this situation.", "YTA, she can't take only one of the kids and presumably doesn't want to need to tell either kid that she went to Disney World without them. If any kids go she has to take both of her kids.", "Take both or none. Simple.\n\nI understand the 4 yo would impede on your activities in Disney World. At that age, their attention span and tolerance for most things is quite limited and it is annoying to say the least. I have a 5 yo and even being in store for 20 minutes is too much for her at times, especially if she gets nothing out of it. So, I completely understand the reasoning for not wanting to take her.\n\nHowever,  if to I am to be completely honest, it sounds like you favor the older child. Which I understand that as well. Older children can be more well behaved than the younger ones, making them more tolerable....sometimes.\n\nNTA, in my opinion. But maybe revisit the Disney World trip in a few years. The 4yo will be 7, maybe her unpredictable toddler-ness will have dissipated a bit, and you all could go together to have the time of your lives.", "YTA- you can bring both a couple years when they can enjoy all the attractions. Only bringing one bigger kid seems kind of mean to the smaller one.", "NTA\n\nBut if your sister wants to go just the two of you, then she may just want to go with you and without her daughters.

And then you could take the 4 year old once she is a bit older. I personally wouldn't have cared about this but I am not super sensitive.

Milly and Mara are 7 and 4yo respectively. They had so much fun my sister asked if the two of us could go for my birthday in a few months. \n\nI said sure but we should bring her older daughter, Milly, along because she's incredibly well behaved and loves Disney World above all things. I felt it would be an AH move to go without her since she would enjoy it more than both of us combined. **My sister said she couldn't do that because, while she'd feel like an AH going without Milly, she would feel like an even bigger AH taking Milly and leaving Mara behind. She said if Mara ever found out she would feel betrayed.**\n\nThe thing is, during their trip, Milly had the time of her life and was well behaved as usual. Mara also had fun (mainly at the hotel pool) but she is prone to tantrums and not only did she have multiple fits, she refused to go on about 90% of the rides because she was afraid (of the dark, of enclosed spaces, of loud noises, etc.). Of course, this probably isn't all too unusual for a 4yo. But my sister and her husband had to take turns missing rides so one of them could sit with Mara each time she didn't want to go on one.\n\nWhen my sister and I go I would like us to be able to ride whatever we please. Milly won't impede that goal, but Mara would.\n\nPlus I would genuinely enjoy having Milly there. She is hilarious and makes such outings fun. Frankly I would feel like an AH going without her.\n\nSo AITA for my suggestion that we should take Milly and leave Mara with her dad?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I grew up having to do what my brother wanted to do and he was older.

I mean your sister apparently wants to have an adult only fun time and apparently you missed the hint and immediately tried to get her to bring the older daughter along.

It almost sounds like you would have more fun with the 7yo alone then with your sister. YTA mildly for trying to push for the kid to come along.", "YTA\n\nYou can't invite one nice and not the other.

Why would you not take the children?", "YTA. \n\nFirst if all, unless Milly is incredibly tall for her age, there are definitely rides she will not be able to get on and thus, you'll miss out on. I'm also guessing that a 7-year-old would have much different taste in rides than you would. This coming from someone who just went to Disney a month ago with an 11, 9 and 4 year old. \n\nAlso, it sounds like your sister wants to go with just you. Perhaps she doesn't feel like being a mom that day? Having to worry about her kid, make sure she's fed, go for bathroom breaks, etc.", "YTA, did you consider maybe your sister would want a break from her kids? If you want to take your older niece some time, do that, but don't put her mom in a bad position because she'd rather just be sisters with you for a trip.", "YTA. Take both children or none at all.", "Hmm this is a soft YTA because I think you are in the wrong to suggest only bringing one of them, when actually you don\u2019t need to bring either and you could just do an adult trip\n\nI\u2019ve done both and honestly Disney without kids just hits different. It\u2019s the best. Even if the kid is an easier age like 7 where they can do a lot for themselves it\u2019s still limiting. She still might not wanna do what you guys want to do.\n\nEven though intellectually and practically  it seems like it makes sense that only the older one could go, it definitely would cause hurt and jealousy, as the 4 year old is old enough to know her big sister gets a trip she doesn\u2019t. This would be something that\u2019s brought up like 20 years later at the family get-togethers, like \u201cremember the time you guys were jerks and took Milly to WDW and left me at home???\u201d. If the 4yo was a baby (like 2 yo or younger) you could get away with it but at this age it would be kinda cruel \n\nBut at the end of the day it\u2019s your birthday.

Clearly you don't have kids of your own, so you don't understand how hard it is for moms to leave one child behind while everyone else is having fun. Also, this trip is supposed to be about you and your sis, and bringing your older niece along would detract from the bonding you could do with your sister over the trip. Tell both girls that this is a Mommy and Auntie trip, and they'll be able to go again some other time. Kids understand that kind of stuff, even at 4yo.", "This. Go. Have fun with your sister.

She just refuses to do it because she knows Mara would feel hurt (and taking both girls definitely WOULD detract from the fun).", "[deleted]", "yeah, this sounds like the obvious solution.\n\nright now Mara isn't at a point where the main part of Disney (the rides) is fun for her. she'd have more fun having Daddy-daughter time at home. playing games. going to the park. whatever.\n\nand would have a blast if you and your sister did a special trip just her to say- a water park where she could have the pool day of her dreams while Milly hangs with Dad.", "It's definitely important that kids get one on one time with parents, and it's also important that kids learn they might not get to do everything. But it's also important to keep things generally fair while doing so.\n\nOp says that Disney isn't close to them - this means the trip will include plane tickets or a long car ride, time off work potentially, money for hotel rooms and eating out, cost of tickets, etc. And a lot of those things (hotel, plane, meals out) feel super super fun and special for kids. If Op and mom are willing to spend a similar amount of time and effort (and potentially but not necessarily money) to plan something equally as fun for Mara, then sure that's fine. \n\nBut if it's going to be \"Milly, you get to come with us to Disney! You get to ride on a plane, stay at a hotel, eat out, and go somewhere every kid dreams of!

Just because its your birthday doesn't mean you can be a jerk  to your four year old niece.", "Not when it means breaking her little niece's heart. You can't make something like that all right for a four year-old. When you have multiple kids, they keep score constantly right down to how many grapes the other got.

This is atrocious judgement on OP's part, when ALL factors are taken into account. YTA, OP.\n\nSure, technically, maybe one girl would cope better. And Milly would probably have fun again. That's the benefit. However, the FAR MORE SERIOUS cost, is a young child is intentionally excluded from DISNEYLAND (a place literally millions of children want to visit). \n\nWe're not talking about a trip to the supermarket here.

A place she was allowed to go previously, but now isn't wanted at. \n\nChildren tend to blame themselves in these situations, and interpret situations like this as reflective of their place in the family. They feel they aren't loved as much; that they aren't as important as their sibling; that the other sibling is the favourite, etc. That's highly distressing for them, and can do emotional damage. \n\nSo no. It's either take both siblings on a holiday like this, or take neither. Milly won't suffer anywhere near as much as Mara, by missing out on going for a second time.

Either extreme is damaging.  But for most people, treating children differently falls somewhere along that spectrum. It has to be judged, weighing up the pluses and minuses of each individual situation. \n\nAnd since the youngest child is likely to unnecessarily suffer emotional harm, vs. what the sister would 'suffer' by not going, it ISN'T justified to treat them differently on this occasion.\nAnd just because you don't have a finnacial obligation to either child, it doesn't mean you get to do what you want (and be an asshole) in relation to children. \n\nIf you want the benefit of contact with children, you take their emotions into account when having that contact with them.

She will act out even worse because she doesn\u2019t understand yet why she is being excluded. Kids at that age (I have a 3.5 myself) are still learning to self-regulate themselves in terms of what they want/ how they feel. When they want something, or feel something, they only know focus on that one feeling/emotion and can be quickly consumed by it - it\u2019s hard for them to distract themselves or understand why their parents are denying them something in the moment, especially when overtired.

There is precious little a 4yo will genuinely enjoy at any Disney park, and at that point, it's a giant waste of money.

As a former Cast Member, nearly every single ride has a designated \"Parent Swap\" spot (or at least a spot where that can be done safely). \n\nAll you have to do is speak to any Cast Member and tell them the situation: we want to ride, but 4yo can't/doesn't want to. The whole group will go through the normal line one (1) time, and then usually around the loading area, a CM will help you to the Swap Spot. One parent rides, while the other parent & kid wait at the Spot... and when the 1st parent comes back, they swap. \n\nEveryone gets to ride, no one feels like they missed out (and Mara doesn't have to deal with that energy that she's \"ruining\" the day for everyone else).\n\nThere's no need for your sister to feel like an asshole because she did something fun without the kids. Sometimes people do fun shit without you, it doesn't mean they don't love you or that they want to hurt you. Not everything is centered around you, and that's a great lesson to start teaching both kids now. \n\nBut if you intentionally exclude just one kid from the birthday fun, specifically because she was acting her age, you're an asshole.

There are fancier restaurants that might not appeal to a 7-year-old, there are some rides a kid that age might not enjoy, etc. You can do things like take off last minute and find somewhere in town to have dinner or go shopping without worrying about it being kid-friendly. \n\nEnjoy the area as two grownups having fun, plus you\u2019re giving your sister a little break that she may very much need.", ">Seven and four year olds are both old enough to understand that different people like and want different things. \n\nYes and this is just going to tell the girls that OP only likes the 7 year old.\n\nBoth girls were just at Disney so you can't use the excuse that Disney is for older kids and when 4 year old reaches 7 she'll get her own Disney trip.

Disney is just tailored for kids a little older. She couldn\u2019t walk as much as you need to. She was up much earlier than normal and up much later than normal. Naps were all messed up. She couldn\u2019t ride so, so many of the rides, ones she actually wanted to ride.

She's 4.", "LOL at \"I was 4 and I *never* threw a tantrum\" \ud83e\udd23 yes, I'm sure you remember every single moment of being 4 and can swear you were the epitome of good behavior, even when hungry, tired, overstimulated, and all the other emotions a small child feels at a place like Disney.", "Seriously? You remember every minute of your childhood? Amazing!", "Sir/ma'am\n\nShe's 4. I also sincerely doubt the 7 year old was perfectly well behaved. She probably did behave better because she's 7 and 7 year olds have more emotional maturity over 4 year olds. Even older children can and do throw fits sometimes because they're still learning emotional control.", "Ya exactly. My sister and I did drinks around the world at Epcot on St Patrick\u2019s day once. It was a blast.", "Yeah, the sister suggested the adults-only trip specifically after she went with the kids, presumably because she realised there\u2019s a lot of things she\u2019d have fun doing with her adult sister that she couldn\u2019t do with her young children in tow!", "Maybe seeing to it that the younger sister has a nap & is well rested would help.", ">I don\u2019t know when it became a thing that all kids must have everything equally or none can.\n\nThere is a huge difference between the older kid getting a phone and the younger one having to wait and leaving one kid out of a literal vacation.\n\nIt's blatant favoritism and there is no world where the child looks back 20 years from now and thinks, \"Yeah, it was totally right for me to be left behind and I'm not bitter about it at all.\" without being sarcastic.", "This isn\u2019t a phone or make up. The 4 year old CAN go to Disney and she CAN have fun. Her aunt doesn\u2019t want to bother to accommodate a 4 year old. Plus, did she ever consider that maybe her sister wants to spend adult time with her and not watching after her kid the whole time?", "This is not the same at all. Growing up, my parents didn\u2019t leave any of us kids out. My mom grew up in a family who did this and it was crushing to her, so she did her best to make sure none of us felt left out. I have 3 kids now and it\u2019s either all or none on a Disney vacation. \n\nDisney is different because it caters to all ages. Make up is something older kids do. Phones are not safe in the hands of younger children. \n\nI have a 4 yr old and she\u2019d be freaking heartbroken if I went without her and took her sister. There is no way I could enjoy Disney while hurting one of my kids.", "Different aged kids can get different things, sure. But BOTH kids have already been to Disney, so explaining to the 4 year old that she\u2019s somehow now too young for a trip she\u2019s already gone on would be confusing and hurtful.", "That\u2019s fine as long as she leaves the kids out of it then (instead of only inviting one)", "My 4.5 daughter was \\~1 inch short of getting on the only 48\" min ride at LEGOLAND last December, she was SO MAD. Meanwhile I'm like: Girl, you are like 3 years ahead here, be happy you got to go on literally everything else (she was, just, end of day meltdown).", "And my 2.5 year old is just about to hit 40\". \\*shrug\\* \n\nAs it happens, the average height of a 7 year old girl is 4 feet tall, plus or minus an inch depending on the chart you use. All US Disney parks have height minimums of 48\" or less, though there are a couple of rides where there are higher limits for solo riders.", "the little one is a toddler, shes 4.", "Glad you\u2019re in the minority. Just adults? No problem. Taking one child and leaving the other at home is an AH move.", "my kids are super happy. we go all out for every single holiday for decorating gifts. we go all out for their birthdays with decorations, special dinner, special activity. vacations for a week twice a year. my kids are having fun every single week. they are totally cool with us leaving them at home. we explain to them that this is sissy and parent time and were doing x, the next time will be theres and we will be doing x. they dont cry about it and are fine with it. my 4yr is totally cool with being left behind, he never cries about it because hes doing something fun with the family or relatives. .", "Hey, you do you and I hope everyone else does to. \n\nI would not bring my own 4 year old to Disney, I would wait until they were a little older and more could experience more and not so many \u201cno\u2019s\u201d would be needed.", "I am livid for you. That's one those disappointments that would make me seethe for years.", "I was super excited when I was in 7th grade and our class's 8th grade field trip was announced, we were going to freaking London! Aaaannnd my family moved states the summer before 8th grade. My new schools 8th grade field trip was a day trip to a local park, it had a pond with leeches, a school sack lunch was included.", "I\u2019d still be mad but I can hold a grudge", "I am also afraid of heights and BEGGED not to go on vacation because of the airplane part. They got me the drugs for the ride, but it was six months of absolute terror before  then. I still would've preferred staying home.", "Why should the three other kids lose out on the trip of a lifetime because you didn\u2019t want to fly? \n\nDisney is hella expensive to babysit a child who doesn\u2019t want to be there.", "Well you should forgive them. You were 14, not 4. Either get on the plane or figure out how to get them a couple more days off and a few hundred in gas, or else stay home with granny.", "This!\n\nWhen I was 4 years old, my older siblings went to a local football game where 2 local late night tv celebrities were going to be. My parents wouldn't let me go because \"it's too late\" and I wasn't old enough. \n\nI happened to know who these guys were because I guess I was up late on the weekends, and I was a fan and I was devastated. It bothered me for years that I couldn't go.\n\nThat was over 50 years ago. Of course it doesn't bother me now, but it was also just a football game. \n\nIf it had been Disney World, I might not ever have gotten over it really.", "But her sister will know, and will remember.  And may decide to mention incessantly.  There will be pics too", "Beer in Germany for the win!", "Why? What\u2019s the \u201chuge\u201d difference?", "And that is what her sister suggested in the first place - a kid free visit so the adults could enjoy themselves", "If there is no AH you say NAH. Means no one's the AH, saying OP is NTA means the sister is. \n\nNTA=not the AH\n\nYTA=youre the AH\n\nNAH=no AH here\n\nESH=Everyone sucks here\n\n\nHope that helps :)", "That still makes no sense? Not the asshole means the other party is the asshole. That's how the verdicts work here. \n\nIf you think neither is the asshole you'd use no assholes here.", "OP is an asshole for wanting to leave the other niece behind.\n\nShe should understand that favoritism doesn't work well in any case.", "\ud83d\ude02 They\u2019re so dramatic.", "A four year old is not a toddler.", "Ok lol. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re pretty young, so I\u2019ll leave you be. I just encourage you to keep an open mind when other people share their lived experiences with you, and maybe reconsider presenting something like this as a \u201cfact\u201d based on one experience you had (that isn\u2019t even a true representation of going to Disney with a 4 year old, because of the mixed ages).", "Yeah, by the time I was able to plan a trip as an adult, I learned the horrors of what goes on at sea world and that curbs the disappointment pretty well. \n\nBut I do just have to work through the fact that life gave us different opportunities and experiences. I can accept that most of the time. But occasionally the memory is there.", "Nooooo, how lame!!\n\nIt's a bummer when you see certain \"milestones\" that others get and you're preparing for it. Counting down the weeks until your time comes.  Then everything changes.", "I see you\u2019ve never experienced a true phobia before. Without therapy and/or meds, just \u201cgetting on the plane\u201d isn\u2019t a fair thing to ask. Saying this as someone who overcame a fear of flying as a highly motivated adult, and it still took years to fly without fear.", "1) don\u2019t show her the photos years later when she can remember things and tell her she wasn\u2019t allowed to come 2) the older sister seems old enough and well behaved enough to be told not to tell her sister and listen, and if not the mom can tell her again. If she makes the mistake of or purposefully tells her sister now she still won\u2019t remember. All this to say that it\u2019s unlikely that this will leave the permanent emotional scar some fear (so any parent who did this don\u2019t freak out and think you ruined your child\u2019s emotional well-being) but it would still be a whole lot easier to just go with her sister.", "Exactly what I said it was. \n\nTry to actually think about what you read before responding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It's blatant favoritism and there is no world where the child looks back 20 years from now and thinks, \"Yeah, it was totally right for me to be left behind and I'm not bitter about it at all.\" without being sarcastic.", "OP is the one who decided to invite only one child therefore OP is TA", "What if OP is not the AH but is still the guilty party?", "What if OP is not the AH but is still the guilty party?", "They are, I was at the store yesterday and heard a girl whining in the exact same tone my daughter uses. I was so relieved, \"whew, it's not just her.\"", "I mean that\u2019s a pretty rude assumption but fine.\n\nIt\u2019s actually ok for people to experience things differently and to want to live life differently than you and make different choices than you make. I\u2019m nowhere near Florida or California, so Disney for me or anyone in my life is more of a once in a lifetime thing, not an annual trip or even something that is experienced more than once. No one in my life are Disney adults, no one knows anything about the parks, nothing like that. Personally, after physically being at disney, if I ever take my kids (I\u2019m 36 btw and about to start a family with my husband), I\u2019d rather wait until they were a little older because in my opinion those types of experiences and the park specifically aren\u2019t really made for kids 4 and under, because of so many rides they can\u2019t ride, timing issues, and toddler issues. I\u2019d want my kids to be able to experience it more, have real memories of it, and more so have a more enjoyable vacation overall for everyone. \n\nNot everyone has the luxury to be able to just pop into to Disney with a small kid for a short 8-2 pm visit because of cost, distance and time. \n\nAgain, you and everyone else can do whatever you want. I just don\u2019t find Disney to be a good place to bring kids younger than 4 ish after experiencing it myself.", "Honestly inviting ANY kids along on a trip where you only want to do what you want to do as an adult is such a bad idea.", "Then its \"NAH, but OP you should really-\" and then you give advice. \ud83e\udd23", "Then just use yta or nah. \nIf you list out all the reasons they're wrong it makes no sense to label the other party the ah lol.", "I've seen *\"soft A H\"* used?", "You do not need to be worried. They\u2019re all difficult \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And that\u2019s a totally valid decision on your end! I apologize for assuming you\u2019re young, but you literally said it\u2019s a \u201cfact\u201d that Disney isn\u2019t designed for or a good experience for four year olds, you didn\u2019t say that it just wasn\u2019t something you\u2019d want for *your* four year old. That\u2019s why you\u2019re coming across as really judgy and, frankly, ridiculously wrong, as evidenced by the millions of 4 year olds that have happily visited Disney since it was founded lol, and by the downvotes you\u2019re getting.\n\nEdit: and it\u2019s also baffling and strange that you keep insisting that families can\u2019t plan around naps, or that four year olds can\u2019t make memories or \u201cget\u201d Disney or ride most of the rides. Like, that\u2019s all just wrong lol. My 6 year old remembers their Disney trips. You\u2019ll look back at this opinion when you have kids and cringe. Don\u2019t be so weirdly opinionated about kid things you don\u2019t know anything about", "Haha, thanks, I knew it was \"normal\" but it hits different when you see examples.", "They sound like a person who has no experience with kids whatsoever and obviously imagining 4 yo being younger than they are. My 2 yo already rarely has naps during the day. A lot of 4 yo wouldn\u2019t need a nap at all. Also 4 yo definitely will enjoy Disney and remember it for ages. I feel like this person just imagining 4 yo like 2 yo or something. It is funny how confident they are about something they obviously have no idea about."]}
