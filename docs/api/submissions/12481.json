She told me that she named and shamed him in a class groupme.\n\nI was initially sympathetic towards her, but upon further questioning, I discovered that her TA had simply asked her out for coffee, and had not made any advances or inappropriate comments towards her. In fact, my daughter admitted that she had never even spoken to him outside of class and didn't know him very well.\n\nI tried to explain to her that asking someone out for coffee is not inherently creepy or inappropriate, but she refused to listen and continued to refer to him as a \"creep.\" After a few days of this, I decided to take matters into my own hands and report her to the college's Title IX office for sexual misconduct and gender-based harassment.\n\nThe office conducted an investigation and ultimately found that my daughter had made unfounded accusations against her TA. They also found that she had violated the college's code of conduct by spreading rumors and making false statements about a PhD student.\n\nMy daughter is now facing disciplinary action from the university, including a possible suspension. She is furious with me for reporting her, and claims that I have ruined her academic career.

A person in a position of power over her (and he absolutely does have that, TA\u2019s are quite often the person doing the actual grading) asking her out places her in an exceptionally uncomfortable spot.

There should be nothing outside the classroom between a freshman student and a TA, especially NOT at the behest of the TA.  Pulling this shit at my university would cost the grad student his assistanceship at a minimum.", "Unfortunately as a TA to a student there is a power imbalance. If that was his intention, he needed to do it as someone in a position of authority because that's exactly what he is to her", "Occam\u2019s razor, man", "Lol", "If her TA actually asked out a student, he is a creep, so it's not baseless.", "Some people don't understand basic ethics, I guess.", "You don't understand, it's an adult thing\n\nEdit: obviously /s!!", "I can see that he probably should have waited until after she had completed the course before he asked her out.", "Naming and shaming is one of the ways women and girls help protect each other.", "The groupchat to me reads as warning other women. I had an experience like this in college on a sports team with a guy who was very intentional about being creepy but in a way that wouldn't get a report taken seriously. It became an open secret to warn eachother about this guy and eventually the person in charge also thought it was unfair I warned others and not let them make their own opinion so she tried to get me to stop talking about it. Well his behavior escalted to the point the police did get involved and have him legally be forbidden from going anywhere near the team or members. Often when we cant report because they skirt that line that \"gossip\" is what help keeps others safe from creeps", "How older is he? Where was that stated\u2026\nI stick by my statement. Unless he was stalking her and being a legit creep calling him a creep is idiotic", "The Title IX office ruled against her. Baseless lol.", "Is that your way of acknowledging that it's creepy for a teacher to ask out a student?", "Yep I\u2019ve named and shamed before when I knew I wouldn\u2019t have any chance at justice through the legal system. I had some people who tried to talk me out of it (though luckily all out of support to me, thinking it would help me to move on). But afterwards I had women reach out to thank me who had almost fallen into his same trap, but because of me they didn\u2019t. That helped me move on better than anything else ever could have\u2014 except getting legal justice of course.", "Yep! Employees at my work have done the same thing with a creep who works in the office. He\u2019s been reported numerous times for his conduct (stuff like using company records to send inappropriate messages to women on their private numbers and giving fewer hours to women who reject his advances) and HR won\u2019t do anything about it. He\u2019s barely even gotten a slap on the wrist. So any time a new woman starts the rest of the staff take it upon themselves to let her know exactly who she need to stay away from. Someone already mentioned this but naming and shaming is how women protect each other when the system won\u2019t", "He\u2019s a PhD student so he\u2019s likely significantly older. Nonetheless even if he happens to be a very young PhD student, he has power over her, her grades, and her education. The fact that you can\u2019t seem to see how that\u2019s wrong is kind of shocking", "Are you saying that it would be inappropriate for him to ask her out even after she was no longer his student?"]}
