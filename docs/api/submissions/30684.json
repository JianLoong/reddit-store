The woman\u2019s daughter can totally deliver food\u2026with her own account. It wouldn\u2019t have mattered who was behind the wheel if your food had been delivered, which is the main reason I\u2019d be reporting the delivery. I hope you were issued a full refund for them losing your meal.", "Doordash driver here.\n\nNTA\n\nI would never ask my kid to do my deliveries for me.\nI would expect to be reported if I did.", "NTA. Part of the reason that it is against the rules to deliver food on someone else's account is precisely to avoid the situation that happened: if it had been on the daughter's account, she would have been able to message you on the app when she couldn't find your place *and* she would have an interest in protecting her account from bad ratings/complaints. \n\nWhile your mother seems like a kind-hearted person, you may want to point out to her that if she had done this to someone with mobility issues (which I have and I can't always retrieve the food if it isn't delivered properly) or limited funds (who can't afford to replace the food in the event that the company has a delay on refunding it), or a medical issue (like a diabetic trying to avoid an issue with low blood sugar), it could easily have resulted in making *that* person's life more difficult. It's good to have empathy, but she should extend her empathy to future customers as well.", "NTA.. Not getting your food but, instead, being given excuses and attitude should be the main issue here. She didn't even attempt to correct her mistake, and got defensive instead. What does it matter who delivered/misdelivered it? If the mom chose to let her daughter sub for her, then she should take responsibility for her daughter's actions.", "I get where your mom is coming from and I too would usually say to be empathetic but in this case the girl was rude and lied. whatever the situation the person responsible for the account should either have coached the daughter or just not done it. It\u2019s clear her daughter didn\u2019t care about her mom\u2019s livelihood if she was doing all that crap.\n\nNTA", "NTA, and if she can't get a responsible person to do her deliveries, she's better off not signing up to deliver any that night.", "People do this (use someone else\u2019s identity fir contract work) when they have a criminal record or something else that makes them ineligible for an Uber account", "NTA.  I'm truly believe that food delivery is a job of last resort and so I give drivers all kinds of leeway. I tip in app AND in person for a delivery.  \n\nBut what's the point of using the service if the food is dropped off in the wrong place and you have to argue with a combative and unresponsive teen?  \n\nI get that emergencies come up and things happen but its still a job.", "ESH who cares who delivers it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
