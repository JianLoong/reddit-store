However he has recently gotten very attached.  to me and doing things that make me uncomfortable. For example he follows me everywhere, smells my hair after a shower, cuddles against my leg, cuddles w me when im trying to eat, rest his head on my chest randomly, just touches me randomly for no reason and etc. I know these might not seem bad but the real issue comes when he gets jealous of my boyfriend (17m). I sometimes invite my boyfriend over as his gym is relatively close to my house and he stays to eat and hang out with me. When this happens , the kid gets obsessed with making him do pushups and other things to prove something? Another problem is that when he gets jealous he makes me and my boyfriend get in trouble as he says things like \u201cthey did something to me\u201d or \u201ctheyre making fun of me\u201d when we are not. He also starts crying and making a scene and then saying hes fine. My mom always takes his side as hes a kid. However I\u2019ve started to try to distance myself a little so he maybe stops these things that make me uncomfortable but every one says im \u201coverreacting\u201d and being an asshole as he\u2019s a kid with a crush. AITA ?\n\n\nUPDATE: thank you everyone for helping me out i appreciate everyones opinions :) I will sit down with my mom and explain the situation and talk to the kid about why he might feel the need to be attached to me and etc , i will make a second update and then maybe delete this post as i dont want this as my first post LOL thank you !!", "created_utc": 1690661538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d1nol/aita_for_being_uncomfortable_with_a_kid_having_a/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's already getting you in trouble for nothing, what happens if he takes it further? \n\nHave a talk to your family and tell them that you're uncomfortable. You shouldn't be touched without your consent, regardless of the age of the child. His parents need to do their job and teach him that it's not ok to do so.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole based on just that, but kids will do what kids will do. They lie, make up stuff. Also seems like he looks at you more like a sister, since you said yall babysit him 24/7, which I don\u2019t quite get. Whatever, as I said, kids are wierd, but I don\u2019t think this should really bother you, just try to not think too much of it.", "YTA: the kid is exhibiting strange behavior for a ten year old. He seems to have some issues with attachment and hypersexuality. It should make you uncomfortable but not for yourself, you're an adult and you can communicate boundaries and speak to the parents. I'd be more uncomfortable for this kid. This is not normal behavior and it's troubling", "nta\n\nthis is not innocent\n\nwhen kids get crushes its normal but to a point\n\nhe is pushing boundaries i dont care if hes 10 he is displaying some troubling signs here", "NTA. Crushes are one thing, physically touching you is another.  Keep setting clear boundaries.  Push him away if have to.  Don't let him hang around when your boyfriend is over.  Any time you give into this,kid, you are empowering him and therefore encouraging him.  If family doesn't believe you, document it.", "No. Stop babysitting him, a crush is one thing but he's getting physical and jealous. Time to end it. Also, talk to his mom about what is going on.", "Nope. NTA. If you really wanna be petty you can ask the kids for permission to take notes or record his behavior and ask them \"Is this okay to you? The lying? He is soon a teen.\"\n\nDon\u00b4t put up with that bs. The kid is 10 but acts 5. You could probably find another kid to babysit that doesn\u00b4t hound you like a dog humping a leg.\n\nedit: ~~ask the kids~~ ask the kids\u00b4s parents", "NTA the kid you are babysitting is being extremely creepy and you should definitely tell his parents or try to talk it out with the kid himself and explain why it's creepy. You definitely not overreacting. It is good that you are distancing yourself with the kid and your mom is some what of an asshole for siding with the kid no matter what.", "NTA. The kid might not think what he's doing is bad. Talk to parents and try and do something, but that could be hard. Next time the guy does something, ask him to please not do it. If that doesn't work, maybe try his parents. I don't know what else, sorry\nEdit: where are his parents tho if you guys are caring 24/7", "NTA .. Document everything and show a responsible adult you trust! You aren't over reacting and if this blows back on you, you have evidence of this kids behavior.\n\nMaking you feel uncomfortable, smelling your hair after a shower, resting his head on your chest and touching you randomly is not acceptable behaviour by a child of any age.", "Any chance the kid has been sexually abused?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It does just sound like an innocent childhood crush, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t set boundaries for your body, personal space, or social life.", "NTA. Kids needs to know boundaries, but you need to speak to your parents when the kid is not around and tell them all this and especially the part where ot's not making you confortable. Even if they are on his side, stand your ground and say \"I dont care, I am keeping my distance and if he frames me and my Bf like he did (put in example) I will not just sit and take it\u201c Be sure to make it sound like you are not planning to hurt the kid, cuz you know thats obviously bad all around, but that you are going to use words and distance to create a barrier between you guys. And later when the little guy starts up shit again, the older folks will see your atitude and maybe  start taking the approach of \"Ok, big sis doesnt want to be bothered\" even if they are annoyed with you. \nInfo:But what do you mean you guys \"babysit him 24/7\"? Like, where are his parents, what is the situation?", "I think the kid has a crush on him but he might not but what he is doing isn't appropriate and is pushing on the boundaries. He may be 10 but that is still a bit weird.", "She is 17, she is Not an adult", "She's not an adult, and she's not responsible for parenting someone else's kid when they don't understand her boundaries", "OP is NTA and is still a minor herself. Definitely strange behavior but as a teen you can\u2019t expect her to be able to choose whether she\u2019s around this child or not. It\u2019s not up to her, it\u2019s on her parents to bring up her concerns with his parents", "This kid is exhibiting hyper sexuality accompanied by an abnormal attachment. He's also ten. Isn't on earth would you ask the kid permission to take notes. He can't consent to that he's a minor.", "So basically his parents are kind of not in the picture but his brother is away working 24/7 so we have him in our care practically", "You mean has a crush on her, or the boyfriend? If the kid does have a crush on the girl, that is wierd, but as I said, it might just be kids craving attention.", "damn I wrote wrong, I meant \"Ask the parent\" not ask the kid.\n\nYeah the kid cant consent.", "Mmm. In that case, it could be bad, because you parents are literally just \"babysitting\" and not actually \"parenting\" him, which is definetely not good if he's staying with you long term (more than a couple of weeks) They probably feel like it's not their place and/or problem to deal with this child's upbringing and behavioural issues and are kinda taking the easy way out which makes it even more important for you to have a talk with them. Btw don't tell them they need to do anything about the kid cause they will 9 out of 10 times take it the wrong way and be like \"A kid is trying to tell me how to look afyer another kid\" Just tell them your side of things and how you are gonna handle the kid moving forward. Dont expect positive feedback cause that's what happens when someone stands their ground, but if you get it, great. Also update your BF on what you plan to do cause he seems to be humouring the little one as well and thats his choice but make sure he understands your point of view. Dont make him do anything even if that undermines your stance a bit. Again that's his choice.", "Sorry I meant to write here not him at the very first part. The way the kid acts towards the op is still a bit weird and should be brought up to the parents."]}
