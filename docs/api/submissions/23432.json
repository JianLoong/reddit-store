However he has recently gotten very attached.  to me and doing things that make me uncomfortable. For example he follows me everywhere, smells my hair after a shower, cuddles against my leg, cuddles w me when im trying to eat, rest his head on my chest randomly, just touches me randomly for no reason and etc. I know these might not seem bad but the real issue comes when he gets jealous of my boyfriend (17m). I sometimes invite my boyfriend over as his gym is relatively close to my house and he stays to eat and hang out with me. When this happens , the kid gets obsessed with making him do pushups and other things to prove something? Another problem is that when he gets jealous he makes me and my boyfriend get in trouble as he says things like \u201cthey did something to me\u201d or \u201ctheyre making fun of me\u201d when we are not. He also starts crying and making a scene and then saying hes fine. My mom always takes his side as hes a kid. However I\u2019ve started to try to distance myself a little so he maybe stops these things that make me uncomfortable but every one says im \u201coverreacting\u201d and being an asshole as he\u2019s a kid with a crush. AITA ?\n\n\nUPDATE: thank you everyone for helping me out i appreciate everyones opinions :) I will sit down with my mom and explain the situation and talk to the kid about why he might feel the need to be attached to me and etc , i will make a second update and then maybe delete this post as i dont want this as my first post LOL thank you !!", "created_utc": 1690661538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d1nol/aita_for_being_uncomfortable_with_a_kid_having_a/", "score": 255, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's already getting you in trouble for nothing, what happens if he takes it further? \n\nHave a talk to your family and tell them that you're uncomfortable. You shouldn't be touched without your consent, regardless of the age of the child. His parents need to do their job and teach him that it's not ok to do so.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole based on just that, but kids will do what kids will do. They lie, make up stuff. Also seems like he looks at you more like a sister, since you said yall babysit him 24/7, which I don\u2019t quite get. Whatever, as I said, kids are wierd, but I don\u2019t think this should really bother you, just try to not think too much of it.", "YTA: the kid is exhibiting strange behavior for a ten year old. He seems to have some issues with attachment and hypersexuality. It should make you uncomfortable but not for yourself, you're an adult and you can communicate boundaries and speak to the parents. I'd be more uncomfortable for this kid. This is not normal behavior and it's troubling", "nta\n\nthis is not innocent\n\nwhen kids get crushes its normal but to a point\n\nhe is pushing boundaries i dont care if hes 10 he is displaying some troubling signs here", "NTA. Crushes are one thing, physically touching you is another.  Keep setting clear boundaries.  Push him away if have to.  Don't let him hang around when your boyfriend is over.  Any time you give into this,kid, you are empowering him and therefore encouraging him.  If family doesn't believe you, document it.", "No. Stop babysitting him, a crush is one thing but he's getting physical and jealous. Time to end it. Also, talk to his mom about what is going on.", "Nope. NTA. If you really wanna be petty you can ask the kids for permission to take notes or record his behavior and ask them \"Is this okay to you? The lying? He is soon a teen.\"\n\nDon\u00b4t put up with that bs. The kid is 10 but acts 5. You could probably find another kid to babysit that doesn\u00b4t hound you like a dog humping a leg.\n\nedit: ~~ask the kids~~ ask the kids\u00b4s parents", "NTA the kid you are babysitting is being extremely creepy and you should definitely tell his parents or try to talk it out with the kid himself and explain why it's creepy. You definitely not overreacting. It is good that you are distancing yourself with the kid and your mom is some what of an asshole for siding with the kid no matter what.", "NTA. The kid might not think what he's doing is bad. Talk to parents and try and do something, but that could be hard. Next time the guy does something, ask him to please not do it. If that doesn't work, maybe try his parents. I don't know what else, sorry\nEdit: where are his parents tho if you guys are caring 24/7", "NTA .. Document everything and show a responsible adult you trust! You aren't over reacting and if this blows back on you, you have evidence of this kids behavior.\n\nMaking you feel uncomfortable, smelling your hair after a shower, resting his head on your chest and touching you randomly is not acceptable behaviour by a child of any age.", "Any chance the kid has been sexually abused?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It does just sound like an innocent childhood crush, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t set boundaries for your body, personal space, or social life.", "NTA. Kids needs to know boundaries, but you need to speak to your parents when the kid is not around and tell them all this and especially the part where ot's not making you confortable. Even if they are on his side, stand your ground and say \"I dont care, I am keeping my distance and if he frames me and my Bf like he did (put in example) I will not just sit and take it\u201c Be sure to make it sound like you are not planning to hurt the kid, cuz you know thats obviously bad all around, but that you are going to use words and distance to create a barrier between you guys. And later when the little guy starts up shit again, the older folks will see your atitude and maybe  start taking the approach of \"Ok, big sis doesnt want to be bothered\" even if they are annoyed with you. \nInfo:But what do you mean you guys \"babysit him 24/7\"? Like, where are his parents, what is the situation?", "I think the kid has a crush on him but he might not but what he is doing isn't appropriate and is pushing on the boundaries. He may be 10 but that is still a bit weird.", "She is 17, she is Not an adult", "She's not an adult, and she's not responsible for parenting someone else's kid when they don't understand her boundaries", "OP is NTA and is still a minor herself. Definitely strange behavior but as a teen you can\u2019t expect her to be able to choose whether she\u2019s around this child or not. It\u2019s not up to her, it\u2019s on her parents to bring up her concerns with his parents", "This kid is exhibiting hyper sexuality accompanied by an abnormal attachment. He's also ten. Isn't on earth would you ask the kid permission to take notes. He can't consent to that he's a minor.", "So basically his parents are kind of not in the picture but his brother is away working 24/7 so we have him in our care practically", "You mean has a crush on her, or the boyfriend? If the kid does have a crush on the girl, that is wierd, but as I said, it might just be kids craving attention.", "damn I wrote wrong, I meant \"Ask the parent\" not ask the kid.\n\nYeah the kid cant consent.", "Mmm. In that case, it could be bad, because you parents are literally just \"babysitting\" and not actually \"parenting\" him, which is definetely not good if he's staying with you long term (more than a couple of weeks) They probably feel like it's not their place and/or problem to deal with this child's upbringing and behavioural issues and are kinda taking the easy way out which makes it even more important for you to have a talk with them. Btw don't tell them they need to do anything about the kid cause they will 9 out of 10 times take it the wrong way and be like \"A kid is trying to tell me how to look afyer another kid\" Just tell them your side of things and how you are gonna handle the kid moving forward. Dont expect positive feedback cause that's what happens when someone stands their ground, but if you get it, great. Also update your BF on what you plan to do cause he seems to be humouring the little one as well and thats his choice but make sure he understands your point of view. Dont make him do anything even if that undermines your stance a bit. Again that's his choice.", "Sorry I meant to write here not him at the very first part. The way the kid acts towards the op is still a bit weird and should be brought up to the parents.", "NTA \n\nYou said he's 10? Can easily reason with him. \n\nYou have every right to point out what is appropriate behavior and what isn't. You have every right to create personal boundaries, and have him respect your space. \n\nKids will be kids doesn't fly here. \n\nMy 7 year old grandson knows more about personal boundaries and consent than this 10 year old does. It's very important to teach him. \n\nHe can ask if he'd like to cuddle that is appropriate, it's ok for kids that age to be affectionate but not when it crosses boundaries. \n\nLying to manipulate so he can get you to do what he wants, not appropriate. \n\nYou have every right to feel uncomfortable, while he can't care for himself 100% he is old enough to start staying by himself for short stints at a time. That means he's old enough to understand how the world works and society rules. \n\nThat kid would make ME uncomfortable and I would certainly set my boundaries and not back down. Even if you get in trouble with the parents. When the boundaries are clearly set it will get easier.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, that\u2019s a CHILD and it\u2019s inappropriate. \n\nSecond, he is trying to get you in trouble when he\u2019s mad. \n\nThird, CYA= cover your ass and do NOT be alone with this child for one second!", "not ok behavior at all! he knows what he is doing and knows how to get his way. IDGF his age, how he responds to being told no, and makes up lies to get his way shows that he does. this is creepy and needs to be addressed. he may grow up and continue this behavior and actually do something dangerous. nta. please keep posted.", "NTA. You are allowed to set boundaries. No one is allowed to touch you if you do not want them to. This is currently an ongoing conversation I have with my 3 and 5 year old. A 10 year old should have already learned this lesson. You can be polite but firm. Parents need to be aware and deal with this now.", "Definitely going to need that update", "NTA. Kids getting crushes is totally natural. Having boundaries set and learning to respect the boundaries of others is also a natural and inevitably part of growing up. You are right to want to set boundaries with this kid, and by doing so will be teaching him a valuable lesson about respect and consent, one that his mother should be very glad to have him learn.", "NTA, no matter the age that kind of obsession is concerning", "NTA. You probably want to set some boundaries and talk about this with your parents. It\u2019s not really normal", "Good Lord, NTAH.", "NTA. That kid is stepping out of line. If you were an adult they would blame you even more even when it\u2019s not your fault. They need to get it through their heads that children can be a problem.", "Nta reminds me of the movie Killer Assistant.", "NTA. He's being creepy and the kid is not far off from puberty and teenage-hood. His behaviour needs to be nipped in the bud before it gets worse.", "NTA", "NTA - you aren't overreacting. There's a crush... then there's the sniffing and random touching - that is *not* good. He should know appropriate boundaries.", "NTA. But stop being there when the family babysits. If he starts any of these behaviors push him off, say ew, get off me etc... Don't let him get close, don't let him hug you. You've got to start being cold and unfriendly. Especially if this talk doesn't work. \n\nGo to a different place with your boyfriend. Do things without this kid around etc.. Have your boyfriend stop playing these games. A good one is to have him take you out while the kid is over.", "NTA. 10 is old enough to learn about consent and the concept that just because he has a crush on someone doesn't mean he is owed their time, attention, or physical proximity. \n\nPlease stress to your mom that by always taking this little boys side, she is teaching him that his feelings matter most, and he should always get his way. That is a dangerous, dangerous thing to teach a child.", "Consent is not just for sex. Children and adults need to understand that no one gets to touch you without asking, and vice versa. If someone doesn\u2019t say no, read their body language. We don\u2019t give hugs and kisses and cuddles without asking first, to anyone of any age or size. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t nailed into brains the way it should be. He needs to learn what\u2019s appropriate, and he is too old to be doing this innocently. He\u2019s 10, and this is borderline sexual harassment. Tell the mom so she can at least try to put a stop to it before it translates to other people in his life. Also yea, I\u2019d keep a distance. It wouldn\u2019t be weird if he wasn\u2019t obvious and obnoxious about it, but he is, so it makes it weird.", "Exactly what I\u2019m wondering. Precocious sexual behaviour can be a sign of abuse.", "its incredible I had to scroll this far down to find this, an I hate to say this but I find it likely that this boy has been SA in some way; this is most definitely not a normal \"crush\" behavior for a child this young.", "This isn't acceptable behaviour from ANYONE.  Child or otherwise.", "Yes. Not always, but it is a marker. Although the little boys I babysat when I was a teen used to fight over who would marry me, and I do not think they were abused. I hope this little guy is okay."]}
