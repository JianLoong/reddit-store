So she comes up with a Christmas tradition that pulls you away from your family\u2026.and cost you time, determining childcare and money\u2026without input from you.   I hope you are enjoying the silence.  Let her not speak to you!", "NTA-she is trying to manipulate and control the holiday.", "NTA. When you say just the girls, does that mean your husband wouldn't be attending?", "NTA.  I'll bet you enjoyed the 2 months of peace and quiet.", "NTA. She's just looking for ways to be in control of making other people miserable.", "NTA. you have every right to set boundaries and say no.  let her pout and show you who she is. i hope your spouse is supportive.", "NTA. You are allowed to make your traditions with your husband and new baby.", "Nta. I agree, any new tradition should be made by the whole family not just one member.", "Nta she's attempting to control", "NTA. It\u2019s your alternate time to NOT be with her and she is trying to step in on that. HARD no.", "NTA. I am the wrong person to give the silent treatment to because I am a stubborn person and I am not chasing you to talk \ud83e\udd23 I would not mind at all that after shutting her down for her intrusion on your family holiday, she didn't speak to me. She was rude and out of line to try to mandate some scheme to insert herself into quality time with your family.", "op=nta\n\nbut I gotta say, 2 months of peace from her sounds delightful, can you piss her off every two months?", "NTA\n\nShe seems to be manipulating you because you went against what she wants. She sounds toxic. If she doesn't get her way she gives the silent treatment. Very mature.", "NTA \n\nSounds like she is trying to make sure you know that she can control things and your schedule.", "NTA- \n\nShe is fairly manipulative isn't she?  \n\nWHY would you have a Holiday event to exclude many members of the family, not for an hour or two but overnight and far away from home?!  Sounds like a pain in the rear end to me. HARD pass.  Holiday's are to spend time with those you love and bring you joy (I don't think your MIL qualifies for either of those), not to leave your husband at home to go somewhere without him.  Enjoy her silence - it probably won't last (sadly. lol)\n\nI think she was also feeling threatened by you visiting your family during Christmas - why? who knows. She must be insecure as well.", "NTA her silence has probably been wonderful", "nta she's loopy.", "NTA. After 5 years, I am sure your family is looking forward to spending Christmas with you and your little one (which I assume they don't see that often). I imagine also that because you don't see them that often, every moment with them count so not wanting not to sacrifice some of this time, to add on traveling, for a \"new\" tradition is more than reasonable. By all means if they want to do it that is fine, you can join them next year if finances allow and you want to.", "NTA. She came up with that to put a damper on your plans. It looks to me like she's into control and lost it when she couldn't control you.", "NTA - girls only??  First of all, you are not her bonus daughter and she is not your bonus mom.  You should only be doing events with his family that includes him.  \n\nWhile you are enjoying your two months of peace, you need to think about changing the dynamic of the relationship. You are the wife of her son.  You shouldn\u2019t be doing \u201cgirls\u201d events with MIL.  That complicates the relationship because you can\u2019t have a separate relationship with MIL.  You are married to her son.  Your relationship is with him.  Your relationship to her is through him.  She is trying to create a separate relationship with you that will pull you away from your husband and away from your family of origin.  When you marry, you are not joining his family and he isn\u2019t joining yours.  You each left your family of origin to create a new family unit.  You present to each family as a unit, not individuals.  Your role with his family is to be polite and engage in small talk, but stick to your husband as he is the one that grew up with them and share dna.  You don\u2019t, you are the wife.  It\u2019s a lot less trouble for you to be the wife and be a half step from his family.  Then you can put it on your husband to deal with his family.  If you maintain separate communications and relationships with his family, when you get into a situation, you are creating an ugly triangle between you and your husband and his family.  There is no triangle if your relationship is through him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Their grand idea was each family was to give $3,000.00 each in order to throw parents a lavish party inviting friends and family, total guests around 200. I realized quickly that as our family there was no way we could contribute that amount of money, we were already struggling to keep up with bills, groceries, child rearing costs, mortgage, vehicle costs etc. I am not outspoken and will just let others do the talking but to me it was not doable and I spoke up and said no way could we do that. Sister-in-laws immediately went on the attack, one of them telling me \"You are saying that you cannot save X-amount of money by putting X-amount of money aside each month\" in a condescending tone. I told her that if we set aside money and a family emergency  came up requiring money I would most definitely use it. Then my other sister-in-laws married to siblings spoke up and said it wasn't doable either, 5 out of the 8 said no, we were the ones with kids. I was the @$$hole who started the rebellion.
