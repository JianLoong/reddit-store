He was ecstatic to find that the Chinese takeaways/fish n chip shop that his mum got for him each Friday as a kid to was still open 20+ years later. Even though we\u2019re on a diet I decided to indulge him and go there for a nostalgia dinner. Big mistake.\n\nAfter spending half an hour talking to the elderly Chinese owner about how he used to go there as a kid (without consideration for me just standing there waiting) he ordered half the menu. Fish and chips, lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork, chicken fried rice. His excuse being we could save leftovers for the next few days. Even though he knows we are on a diet.\n\nWhen we finally got home to eat he asked me what I thought. I\u2019m someone that speaks how I feel (he knows this) so I was honest: it was terrible. The chips were too salty and not crispy enough, fried rice skimped on the meat, sweet an sour pork didn\u2019t feel authentic, among other things. I\u2019m confident if not for my husband\u2019s nostalgia glasses he would say the same.\n\nMy husband is acting like I personally insulted his late mother. As if I was supposed to lie and pretend to like a disgusting meal he didn\u2019t even make.

Big mistake.\n\nAfter spending half an hour talking to the elderly Chinese owner about how he used to go there as a kid (without consideration for me just standing there waiting) he ordered half the menu. Fish and chips, lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork, chicken fried rice. His excuse being we could save leftovers for the next few days. Even though he knows we are on a diet.\n\nWhen we finally got home to eat he asked me what I thought. I\u2019m someone that speaks how I feel (he knows this) so I was honest: it was terrible. The chips were too salty and not crispy enough, fried rice skimped on the meat, sweet an sour pork didn\u2019t feel authentic, among other things. I\u2019m confident if not for my husband\u2019s nostalgia glasses he would say the same.\n\nMy husband is acting like I personally insulted his late mother.

Fish and chips and Chinese takeaways are a staple in many a home so the exact restaurant from his childhood being open must be a huge deal.

Are you jealous that he went on and on about the great memories of him and his mom? It sounds like you childishly went out of your way to attack the memories by attacking every bit of food there was. Sure, the food probably wasn't that great when he was a kid, but what made it so great was his mom and him having it together. I have those same memories of a place my dad took me when I was young and it's still there. The memories make it so special.

Experience has shown me that people who \u201cspeak how they feel\u201d as they proudly put it are essentially just people who don\u2019t really care if they hurt people or not.
