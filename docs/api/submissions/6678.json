He was ecstatic to find that the Chinese takeaways/fish n chip shop that his mum got for him each Friday as a kid to was still open 20+ years later. Even though we\u2019re on a diet I decided to indulge him and go there for a nostalgia dinner. Big mistake.\n\nAfter spending half an hour talking to the elderly Chinese owner about how he used to go there as a kid (without consideration for me just standing there waiting) he ordered half the menu. Fish and chips, lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork, chicken fried rice. His excuse being we could save leftovers for the next few days. Even though he knows we are on a diet.\n\nWhen we finally got home to eat he asked me what I thought. I\u2019m someone that speaks how I feel (he knows this) so I was honest: it was terrible. The chips were too salty and not crispy enough, fried rice skimped on the meat, sweet an sour pork didn\u2019t feel authentic, among other things. I\u2019m confident if not for my husband\u2019s nostalgia glasses he would say the same.\n\nMy husband is acting like I personally insulted his late mother. As if I was supposed to lie and pretend to like a disgusting meal he didn\u2019t even make.

Big mistake.\n\nAfter spending half an hour talking to the elderly Chinese owner about how he used to go there as a kid (without consideration for me just standing there waiting) he ordered half the menu. Fish and chips, lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork, chicken fried rice. His excuse being we could save leftovers for the next few days. Even though he knows we are on a diet.\n\nWhen we finally got home to eat he asked me what I thought. I\u2019m someone that speaks how I feel (he knows this) so I was honest: it was terrible. The chips were too salty and not crispy enough, fried rice skimped on the meat, sweet an sour pork didn\u2019t feel authentic, among other things. I\u2019m confident if not for my husband\u2019s nostalgia glasses he would say the same.\n\nMy husband is acting like I personally insulted his late mother.

Thankfully, my SO has not taken me to a shitty restaurant, wasted my time, and spent our money under the guise of nostalgia.  \n\nHere, the BF allegedly made OP wait idly for an hour while he took the restaurant staff down his memory lane, which is inconsiderate.  He then ordered an abundance of food that is reportedly terrible and spent his and OP's after tax money on it, which is selfish.  In that scenario he is an asshole or at least he acted like one.  OP sounds like a real pain in the ass.  So, they both suck.", "I said if he likes it thata good for him ... Where did I said he should hate it ?", "I\u2019m not sure why you think I didn\u2019t. Just because he was nostalgic about it doesn\u2019t mean she HS to pretend it was good, I said what I said.", "True. Didn't read clearly.\n\nThanks for clarifying!", "But OP described the food. Whether she liked the food or not has nothing to do with the husband's childhood memories.", "But OP's feedback was about the food.\n\nIt makes no sense to ask for an opinion that can be related directly to the experience he used to live with his mother because that is a very personal thing and there's no way OP (or anyone else) can give an opinion about that.", "And those kind of jabs don't go away. He won't ever not be hurt by this memory.\n\nI'm weirdly furious about this AITA lol", "This!! You sucked the joy out of the experience for him and tarnished the memory. Why would you do this to someone you love?", "I agree. I would be much more understanding of feeling the need to comment on not being fond of the food if there were a real risk of returning regularly. And she could have just said she didn't care much for it without ruining his mood. \n\nBut even then, NOTHING could excuse or justify her insufferable attitude about everything.", "This.  I feel sick to my stomach thinking about how sad he was.  I\u2019m from a particular area that is very different from where my husband is from and where we now live.  I almost never go back, but when I do, it\u2019s really emotional.  It\u2019s usually not exactly as I remember (so much nostalgia), and where I live now is much more progressive and has better everything.  But my husband always enjoys what I share.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t about the food.  It feels to him like it\u2019s HIM he\u2019s sharing.  Our childhood is what makes us who we are.  And you rejected that.  YTA.", "Also, there\u2019s no telling how long it was from the restaurant to their home, so some of the issues (chips not being crisp) could be due to the ride home. She\u2019s definitely the AH though.", "EXACTLY. Funnily enough, that\u2019s the exact response I thought in my head before I scrolled down and read your comment. It\u2019s just social etiquette so you don\u2019t poop on someone\u2019s special memories. \n\nIt reminds me of that quote/saying- \u201cHonesty without kindness is cruelty.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s honesty with kindness to say that it wasn\u2019t your cup of tea but you\u2019re happy he relived some memories. \n\nIt\u2019s cruelty to do what OP did.", "THIS right here. Another person who thinks its a virtue to \"speak their mind\" when its just an excuse to be cruel. Like OP,  get a clue. He was thrilled and excited and of course thats why he ordered half  the menu and enjoyed it. Your reaction was absolutely unnecessarily hurtful.  Per the comment above, you can be TRUTHFUL but still supportive - ie \"Not going to lie honey, I think you enjoyed it all way more than me because of your memories, but I'm so happy you were able to revisit your past.\"", "Honestly, my partners joy in the food would have made the meal so worthwhile I would have relished every salty, meat stingy bite with a smile on my face. I think there\u2019s something more about the diet aspect. Op may feel concerned about their health or feel unsupported in their goals or whatever and that caused the meal to be met with contempt and not joy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the food because relationships just don\u2019t last when you don\u2019t take joy in your partners joy.", "This is what got me, there is no \"authentic\" sweet and sour pork, because the dish was invented for outsiders. 90% of what we eat at Chinese Restaurants would never be served that way in China.", "She complained about him chatting with the owner", "I dont think the issue here is her saying she didn't like it, Its HOW she said it, she was cruel, a bunch of people said in other comments, theres a lot of ways to tell the truth without being cruel.", "Yeah, voting NTA here shows exactly why you would reply with \"I said what I said\", lmao. Just as insufferable as OP.", "Saying the fried rice skimped on chicken and that the sweet and sour pork didn\u2019t seem authentic is *reaching* for something to complain about.\n\nHer nitpicking of the food feel like she was trying to hurt him for being annoyed that they went in the first place.", "There is a long line of literature\u2014going all the way back to the Illiad\u2014that food is not just about the food but about the memories it evokes and people around the table.", ">This isn\u2019t about the food. It feels to him like it\u2019s HIM he\u2019s sharing. Our childhood is what makes us who we are. And you rejected that. YTA.\n\nWell put. He opened up and shared something meaningful to him, and OP just showed him how little she cared.", "And it\u2019s not something they\u2019ll be doing frequently, she could be nice about one meal that meant a lot to him.  YTA", "Exactly. I view myself as a very outspoken person who doesn't care if people will get offended by my opinion. But speaking your mind is NOT the same as just being outright mean and hurtful. People need to learn manners", "Whatevs", "That's far-fetched. It's looking for something that wasn't said at all.", "Nice literature, and I totally get that (been there, done that).\n\nBut you can't expect people to give you a positive opinion about food they tasted because their preferences over food aren't tied to your personal experiences.\n\nSay, you tell me, \"let's go to a pizza place I used to go when I was a kid and brings me great memories; it happens to be right around the corner.\" We go, I try it and don't like it. My opinion about the pizza has nothing to do with your very own personal memories about the place. How could you get offended if I don't like it?", "Aaaand once again, thanks for proving my point. \n\n  \n\"I always give my honest opinion\" is just a cheap excuse to be an asshole.", "Read my prior comment", "Whenever you get tired of caring about an internet strangers opinion let me know.", "You didn\u2019t answer my question.", "\"Whatevs\""]}
