He was ecstatic to find that the Chinese takeaways/fish n chip shop that his mum got for him each Friday as a kid to was still open 20+ years later. Even though we\u2019re on a diet I decided to indulge him and go there for a nostalgia dinner. Big mistake.\n\nAfter spending half an hour talking to the elderly Chinese owner about how he used to go there as a kid (without consideration for me just standing there waiting) he ordered half the menu. Fish and chips, lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork, chicken fried rice. His excuse being we could save leftovers for the next few days. Even though he knows we are on a diet.\n\nWhen we finally got home to eat he asked me what I thought. I\u2019m someone that speaks how I feel (he knows this) so I was honest: it was terrible. The chips were too salty and not crispy enough, fried rice skimped on the meat, sweet an sour pork didn\u2019t feel authentic, among other things. I\u2019m confident if not for my husband\u2019s nostalgia glasses he would say the same.\n\nMy husband is acting like I personally insulted his late mother. As if I was supposed to lie and pretend to like a disgusting meal he didn\u2019t even make.

Big mistake.\n\nAfter spending half an hour talking to the elderly Chinese owner about how he used to go there as a kid (without consideration for me just standing there waiting) he ordered half the menu. Fish and chips, lemon chicken, sweet and sour pork, chicken fried rice. His excuse being we could save leftovers for the next few days. Even though he knows we are on a diet.\n\nWhen we finally got home to eat he asked me what I thought. I\u2019m someone that speaks how I feel (he knows this) so I was honest: it was terrible. The chips were too salty and not crispy enough, fried rice skimped on the meat, sweet an sour pork didn\u2019t feel authentic, among other things. I\u2019m confident if not for my husband\u2019s nostalgia glasses he would say the same.\n\nMy husband is acting like I personally insulted his late mother.

It wouldn\u2019t have been in my top 50, but when asked I smiled, said I could see why he loved it, and that it just wasn\u2019t my style. He was dining on nostalgia and there\u2019s nothing more delicious than good memories. You could have been more empathetic. Sounds like you\u2019re more angry about breaking your diet. \n\nBTW - \u201cman up\u201d? Really? The 90\u2019s called and would like their sexist sayings back. You wouldn\u2019t like it if someone called you emotional or crazy if you had a passionate response to something you cared about. Don\u2019t belittle him with sexist insults.", "YTA \nCan't even be happy for him finding this place, connecting with someone in his hometown after some time. You seem annoying and hard to please.", "You were mad about being there long before you ate the food which probably played a part in why you didn't like the food. You didn't like breaking his diet. I loved how you said you decided to let him off his diet to eat at a place he was excited to eat at. Then you got mad at him for having the nerve to talk about his memories of the place with the owner and you couldn't be the center of attention for half an hour. Something to know about psychology but how food tastes is linked to how you feel when you eat it. A food critic can change their opinion on how the food at a restraunt tastes by how good or bad of a day they had before trying the food. That could have been the best Chinese food you ever had and you would have still hated it because you were pissed off your husband got to reminisce and you weren't the center of his universe. It wasn't about what you wanted but it was about him for a change. You stomped all over his time being back in his hometown not because the food was bad but because you were mad at him. \n\nAlso, there is no such thing as authentic sweet and sour pork.", "Do you even like your husband?", "What's up with couples acting particularly cruel or hurtful to their partners?", "YTA. Your husband was excited to show you something important to him and you shit all over it. \n\nFurthermore, a phrase to remember is: Honesty without tact is cruelty.", "Wow, YTA and owe him a sincere apology.", "YTA. When are people going to learn that \u201cI\u2019m someone that speaks how I feel (he knows this) so I was honest\u201d, doesn\u2019t give the go ahead to be a complete ass.", "Ah, the motto of assholes everywhere, \"but I was just being honest!\" \ud83d\ude44 YTA.", "YTA. I usually never comment on this sub but damn you are such a jerk.", "Thank you for typing all this out. I couldn't even get half way through her post before I had PTSD triggers from my ex-wife, who was an even more miserable human if you can believe it. Jumped down to hope to see YTA threads and was much relieved once I read yours. You validated how I felt when I was in that sham of a marriage.", "YTA. You clearly didn\u2019t want to be there so you crapped all over your husband\u2019s memory and good time he was having. Maybe the food sucked but you decided that because he had the audacity to talk with someone for a half and hour and ignore you\u2026 and then order a bunch of food when \u201cwe\u201d are on a diet.", "I just laughed, so well done on including that.", "Right. OP sounds ick.", "TBH, GR is an arsehole IRL too. He does hype it up for tv shows, but the baseline he starts from is more than your typical everyday AH", "Yes! This one stuck with me too! Really op?", "Yes! Add soon as I read that I was almost certain she would be TA. Usually when someone days, \" I say what I feel\", \" I'm very blunt\",  \"I'm brutally honest\"- that person is just an asshole. And she definitely strikes me as the type.\nAnd op, YTA", "That\u2019s such a good point. \u201cI just like to make jokes,\u201d \u201cthat\u2019s just my sense of humor,\u201d too. It\u2019s fine but other people get to have their own responses to it and act accordingly!", "No it's beacuae of all the chips", "I wondered that, too, but mostly just because OP seems rather controlling\u2026", "There was no such thing as authentic sweet and sour pork.  That\u2019s not even on the menu in Asia.", "The part that really seals YTA for me is when OP mentioned how the stop went. \"I indulged him (for wanting to go inside)\"; \"he talked for 30 minutes without considering I was just standing there...\"\n\nThat's your husband. He is having a fond trip of his childhood, and sharing that with his life partner, and OP is just... annoyed by the whole thing. He orders half the menu: the place is a big deal in his mind!\n\nAnd then she shits all over his shared delight as if he is beneath her, because truly, OP is TA.", "For real! There are thousands of kilometres of ocean between me and my childhood home, and I would give anything to be able to go back for a day to reminisce and maybe find the old corner store/fry shop down the road to eat their surely terrible and inauthentic but perfect-in-my-memory food, and make me feel like I\u2019m a kid again. Fuck OP for ruining that experience for her partner.", "Could not have said it better. Comes off as she doesn\u2019t even like her husband tbh", "\ud83d\udcaf", "I mentioned in another comment - her reply wasn\u2019t about being honest. She said it to be hurtful because she had to go to a restaurant she didn\u2019t want to go to and sit through his conversation with the owner she didn\u2019t give a shit about. People are missing OP\u2019s post. She INTENTIONALLY hurt him with her words. It wasn\u2019t about being honest.", "That\u2019s not an \u201celitist\u201d take at all, unless one feels being kind to their spouse an elitist trait (which I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t \ud83d\ude42)", "Yes. This right here. This is what OP was doing - she was intentionally trying to hurt her husband because he \u201csubjected her\u201d to half an hour of unpleasantry at a restaurant that means a lot to him but nothing to her. She\u2019s selfish. Plain and simple.", "Some days it feels that way lol.  People are terrible.", "The diet is a non-starter. It\u2019s simply another reason for her to bitch about him getting a bunch of food to take home. She didn\u2019t like it so she won\u2019t eat it, therefore it\u2019s no threat to HER diet. (To indulge in a guilty pleasure occasionally while changing your overall habits is a healthy way to approach weight loss and diet change. The more you severely restrict yourself the more likely you are to \u201cfall off the wagon.\u201d)", "That is an all time savage roast and I love it. Really striking right to the deep insecurities, and it hurts because it\u2019s true.", "My favorite is Kraft singles pressed in one of those Oster sandwich makers they had in the 90s. On rye bread ideally. Because it\u2019s what my parents made me. It\u2019s still what I want to eat when I don\u2019t feel well. Your grandma\u2019s cheese sandwich sounds delightful.", "I seriously doubt it. Ha! That would be neat if there was a bRuTaLlY hOnEsT category.", "The weird thing is that she didn\u2019t have to eat big portions of any of it. She\u2019s blaming her decision to not be considerate to her diet on her spouse imo.", "Hopefully this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back with OP\u2019s husband. She sounds miserable", "This really wasn\u2019t an incidence warranting a \u201cbrutally honest\u201d critique other than OP wanting to throw verbal barbs at her husband and shitting on his enjoyable and nostalgic experience. That\u2019s just being petty and vindictive.", "Oh my word, yes!  I have known so many people who brag about their \"honesty\" and get annoyed with the hurt feelings that they cause, but who are extremely sensitive themselves", "This, and I can almost bet mom made a big fuzz about Chinese food Friday!\n\n\nBecause as a single mom it was one of the few luxuries she could afford.\n\n\nYTA", "I can almost fully guarantee she\u2019d be pissed. These types usually only want to dish it and can\u2019t take it back.", "Oh your right! Idk why I had in my head she offered in a nice way", "Oh, I\u2019m in no way justifying or defending her.", ">YOU need to human up a bit\n\nThis is my reaction to this post in a nutshell.", "Man up is so condescending omg. His mother also passed so it seemed it was to him not so much eating the food it was a memory for him. Reliving that moment and remembering his mom. Like just say you\u2019re ok with it and move on. He didn\u2019t ask for a critic damn"]}
