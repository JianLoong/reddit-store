Hooters is an establishment known for breasty, scantily-clad women (it\u2019s literally the entire name and absolutely part of the brand). It gets called a family restaurant and the sexual element is downplayed, but come on.  It\u2019s patronized because of the way the girls look, and because it\u2019s seen as a more acceptable way to enjoy looking at sexy women than going to a strip club. Even if some people don\u2019t go there for that, it is what it is. \n\nEvidence A: people like the man who recognized her obviously go there for this, and obviously interpret the girls there with a sexual element.

Tons of questions about her body, whether she can maintain her tan, what parts of her body get freckly in the summer\u2026.
