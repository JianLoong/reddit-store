They ask another time in which I tell them that I had to work that night, which they understood and then a third time they request me and I let them know that I'm able to for the normal fee and everything so they agree. \n\nCome the night I come over to watch the kid, they have some of their friends over  and are all getting ready to leave when one of their friends askes them if they're okay letting a sex worker look after their child. The father, let's call him Joe, M38, pulls me off to the side with his wife and ask if it's true. I told them that no I wasn't a sex worker, I worked at Hooters as a server. They got all mad saying that was still sex work and that I should have told that to them when they first asked about hiring me. Long story short we got into an argument and they \"fired\" me  from watching their child and have now posted about it on Facebook to not have me hired to watch any kids.
