It\u2019s not like you are dancing around their children scantily clad.", "Lol NTA, people are out of their minds.", "NTA\n\nBut they are. Here's a question, how did the guy know you work at Hooters anyway?  Must have been there. Oops.", "How is working as a server a sex worker, lol? No shame in sex work either, but what the af? NTA at all. You're honestly better off without them.", "NTA\n\neven if you were a sex worker it wouldn't change the quality of your work as a babysitter. I get that your morals and decision making skills could be called into question (by more close minded people), but as long as you treat the kids right I see no reason to hold your job against you\n\nAnd depending on what they posted on facebook you could sue them over this to get it removed and maybe even a bit of money for them damaging your reputation.", "NTA. Weird stuff it\u2019s a restaurant with some cleavage and bottom butt cheeks lol", "So let me get this straight\u2026you work at hooters as your main job as a server. You pick up babysitting jobs as a second job. Ok so far!! Now these people who hired you are satisfied with your babysitting services. Their friends say that you are a sex worker because you work at hooters. My question is WHY ARE THEY GOING TO HOOTERS? To solicit sex? No they are going to eat food! Their friends have a very big double standard going on!!! Be glad you don\u2019t have to work with those small minded people!!", "Being a server at hooters isn't sex work.

It's none of their business what you do when not working for them.", "NTA\n\nBut this is a bit of an odd post. You don't \"mix the two\"? What would mixing them look like? Doing childcare at Hooters? Babysitting in a miniskirt and a tight top that you're hanging out of?\n\nIt's clear that one of your client's friends is a regular at your Hooters, and recognized you. And it's clear that there's a massive sexual double standard at play here, because it was clearly OK for your client's friends to be a regular Hooters customer, and to perv at the staff, but it's beyond the pale for one of the staff to come out from behind her breasts and pretend to be a normal person.\n\nNo, you don't have any obligation to tell prospective clients what other jobs you have. What matters (should matter) is how you behave around the kids, what skills you have that are useful for babysitting kids, how reliable you are, and so on. I might be interested in what else you do, because your other job might include skills that I would find useful or reassuring. Maybe you're a paramedic or a teaching assistant or something. Those would be useful skills.", "Ummm wow. Me thinks the dad doth protest too much. Seriously? What whackos", "People are off their heads. I'm in Australia. To me, Hooters aren't even skimpies.

Those people are delusional if they think being a server at Hooters is being a sex worker. There is NOTHING to be ashamed about working at Hooters. Not one thing.

It sounds like they did you a favor but spreading that you shouldn't be hired is showing their character, not yours.", "NTA you're a server at a chain restaurant. If being a server at Hooter's is \"sex work\" why, pray tell, do they allow the family friend that called you a sex worker near their children? How does their friend know that you work at Hooters if that friend doesn't frequent Hooter's enough to recognize waitstaff from the restauraunt?\n\nAlso, screen shot that post on Facebook and any nasty comments, then seek out legal counsel. They've gone beyond being ignorant buffoons to now trying to interfere with you being able to get work (if they are referring to you as a sex worker or implying that your job at Hooter's is anything other than being a server, this may count as defamation, especially as they've made it clear their intent is to interfere with you gaining any form of employment in which you could be around children)", "if an insecure male calls hooters \"sex work,\" then it's only because he went there, and fell for Hooter's system of getting dudes to spend more than they were willing because of the staff, it's not your fault, it's corporate and this dude's faults. he thought by tipping his favorite waitress more he'd get some action and when that failed, his insecurity started calling it \"sex work\" to justify his rejection when literally the waitresses shouldn't be doing that as a default lol. it's like complaining how working at a sams club makes you a mental manipulator because the store changes the layout in an attempt to get people to spend spend spend. NTA op, not your fault at ALL", "how'd that person know you were a Hooter's girl without (presumably) having visited the establishment themselves?", "NTA at all. In the instance that they ask you again because they are desperate, I hope you will charge the an asshole tax. And a stupidity tax on top of that.\n\nI used to do similar at work.", "Info: Why would a server at Hooters waste time babysitting when slinging wings and beers is so much more lucrative? This story just rings hollow to me. In my youth, I was friends with a bunch of people who worked at Hooters, and other restaurants, if they wanted extra money they'd simply pick up extra shifts. This reads like you've created a fictional situation to get a reaction from people. Actual sex workers aren't going to babysit when their primary job pays so much more. The same applies to Hooter's girls.", "NTA, you dont have to disclose your work, but if you work in that line of work this is to be expected.
