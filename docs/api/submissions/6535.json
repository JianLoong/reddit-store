My god did you do some mental gymnastics to create all those imagined scenarios.", "Being hostile to a stranger isn\u2019t being careful at all.", "Letting a creep know that you've seen them is actually a good thing.

Much safer.", "If he said that a woman (or a man for that matter) was creeping on him because she happened to be in the same grocery aisle as him a couple of times then I would say that he may just be flattering himself, yes.\n\nBut, I will concede that maybe that was a bit harsh. I don't know OP and don't know what she's like. But I have seen people flatter themselves this way.", "To your first question why does that matter?\n\nIt's not actually that suspicious or weird to end up in the same grocery aisle as someone else a few times during a grocery trip. It doesn't prove anything. Yeah, maybe he was creeping on her. Not saying it's not possible. And it was fine for her to be aware. But if I were just out minding my own business trying to buy my groceries I certainly wouldn't appreciate being accused of being a creeper just because I happened to end up in the same aisle as someone else a few times.", "That's definitely more rational but sometimes I'm too tired after work to talk to people (I'm super introverted). I'd rather give people a minute before going in with the excuse me's and sorry's. \n\nIf I see the same people twice (very likely 'cuz we all need  veggies, milk, candy, coffee and bread) I start going down the aisles in reverse order and hope I don't see them again. \n\nAlso - forgot to mention earlier - I'm a petite young woman. Most people aren't intimidated by me, but I'm definitely scared of them yelling at me lol.", "You defend her confronting someone who is minding their own business with \"possibly he did something\" and have the nerve to accuse me of gaslighting?\nMust be nice in that fantasy land you live in.", "Yes, it is. Especially if done while in the store. Many predators take advantage of women feeling societal expectation to be nice and docile. Showing in a safe place that you are not those things, does help. \n\nSo if that was truly just an innocent person; she maybe confused him and gave him a story to tell when he gets where he\u2019s going. If he Was dangerous, she painted herself as a loud and difficult victim, and he\u2019ll probably choose someone else or go home alone.", "Thanks for the info!", "Definitely!", "Because if its men then seems like the problem lies in that. I'm not saying men can't be assaulted by women, what I'm saying is it just feels like if men are being assaulted by men then your logic of \"men get assaulted too\" doesn't really apply here", "Lol just to say then, as a young petite woman, it is very unlikely you will ever be seen as a threat, people don\u2019t get threatened if a kid follows them around because in their mind the kid can\u2019t really make them feel unsafe, as would most people with you because you\u2019re not going to be thought of as a predator as a young woman, but on top of that most people won\u2019t feel like someone smaller/weaker than them(don\u2019t mean that as an insult, I\u2019m young and petite too) could make them feel unsafe. As a woman though, majority of men can naturally over power you and with how shitty the world can be, most women prefer to be safe then sorry and tbh if I saw the same person aisle after aisle I would think I\u2019m being followed unless I\u2019m literally just cruising down each one looking because it\u2019s more than normal to see the same person while shopping but to have someone come directly to the same aisle as you multiple times and only after you leave can definitely feel stalkerish", "YTA. He did not approach you or tried to talk to you.", "NAH \n\nits likely, imo, that he just happened to be following the same route through the store as you, it happens when me and my husband get groceries all the time, its almost like we're following/being followed by someone else.\n\nbut you were alone, and he was alone, and that shit can be creepy. you gotta watch after yourself, and you did. \n\nas someone else mentioned, I think maybe a safer option than confrontation would have been to make a random aisle change, cause now we'll never know for sure but meh. it is what it is.", "Not gonna pass judgement, but when this has happened to me before, instead of making accusations (as justified as you might feel in the moment), I address them and ask 'oh sorry, am I in the way of what you need?' - it lets them know you're aware of their presence, their potential lurking, and helps avoid any misunderstanding. If they do really need something you're standing near, then they'll mention it then. And in my experience, the biggest tell that they were creeping is the mumble and quick retreat response XD", "NAH. Definitely have accidentally kept running into the same people in the grocery store before. However I have also had people be creepy and follow me around a store. Only you can judge which you thought it was. \nI will say I think you should\u2019ve alerted an employee instead of confronting him. They might not have been able to do much, but they can help determine if someone is actually being creepy or just happen to be shopping everywhere you shop.", "  I have been harassed and groped (!) at the grocery store so to me OP is being aware, and yeah had a bad reaction to a guy possibly following her. It happens. I don\u2019t she\u2019s an A H for this one time. \n  I snapped at a man too in a grocery store, he told me I needed to \u201csmile\u201d and I snapped my father had just died so sorry I wasn\u2019t in the mood to smile, because my dad had just died that week. NAH", "YTA you are not that special.", "Nta but you probably could have approached in a safer way. It would have been better to tell a staff member and do a few more aile changes to confirm with someone watching. That way you are sure when you approach the stalker and you have back up in case things go sour. Hopefully he backs off and now the grocery store staff are alerted to see if he chooses a new target. \n\nBut hindsight is 20/20 and you were exhausted. I'm just thankful you are safe.", "Nta. Always listen to your spidey sense...aka gut instinct", "This is a hard one. I actually have had this happen accidentally once, although on the third aisle I just left and waited for her to leave to avoid making her nervous. You definitely aren't TA, but I really don't know if he is. So either N T A or N A H, but only he knows which.", "The problem here is that so many abusive men are well-versed in keeping on just the right side of harassment, so you never can be sure that they're following you, and if you suggest they might be, you get similar responses to ones you're getting here. This isn't accidental.\n\nI'm not sure confronting him was the best idea, but certainly being aware of him was necessary. It's a no-win situation and that again is not an accident.", "meh NTA, why was he staring at you in each aisle if it was coincidence? Especially since one of the aisles was all the way on the other side.  \n\n\nYou could have been a bit less harsh. But people saying \"oh the fact he looked shocked means he didnt mean anything by it\". No, they look shocked because they're not used to being called out for being creepy.", "I have never shouted at a stranger because of a bad day, not post toddler sort of age.", "You gave the guy a good story! \ud83d\ude0a", "The person I was responding to said \"women in particular\" which was just factually incorrect.", "Its isn't though at all. Women do need to be concerned about men, women in particular. \n\nIf men were drugged, killed, assaulted, beaten, AS OFTEN by women as often as women were by men then your statement would be accurate. \n\nIf you look up gender crime statstics men hold the lead on assaults, robbery, murder etc. \n\nThe only assault charge where men presented holding higher than women was violent assault by other men. Men haven't had to fear for their lives when telling a woman no.", "It's irrelevant who does the assaulting. I never said that men had to be more afraid of women than women had to be afraid of men. I just said that men are more likely to be the victim of violent crimes which is just a factual statement. I don't know why you are so focused on who tends to be the perpetrators. Yes, men are more likely to do the assaulting but they are also more likely to be the victims.", "Because your commenting on a women's post who was concerned for her safety saying \"well men need to be safe too\" yes, from other guys. Men fall victim more to violent crimes, and women fall victim more to sexually related crimes. We have no idea what this person's intent was and while it could have been nothing he also could have been following and profiling her to identify if she was truly alone and when was a good time to strike. Say she had said nothing and the next time she saw this guy was next to her car where she is significantly less safe and more vulnerable to her environment. \n\nWhile she might have come off as an asshole to that person she's not an asshole for doing what she thought was the right thing to do to protect herself.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"How were they not in the same boat?\" ...
