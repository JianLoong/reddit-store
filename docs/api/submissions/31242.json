I just wonder if his wife truly felt stressed because of you or because of their wedding and he was trying to twist it to put all the blame on you. Did other instances like this appear in your childhood or young adult lives?", "NTA.  \nIf he cared, he'd know. The biggest AH here is your brother.", "It\u2019s amazing what happens when you really look at a relationship and. Who reaches out.  Who actually asks about you and events happening in your life rather than it all about them\n\nI love the fact his words could be used against him in this situation and  the petty it\u2019s your choice \n\nNta", "NTA\n\nLook, you told them you couldn't be heavily involved because you were elsewhere and in school. They said that was okay, but then punished you for it.\n\nAnd you're right: If your brother wanted to know about your life, he could have asked at any point.\n\nHe seems like a jerk at this point, TBH.\n\nCongrats on your wedding. Don't worry about him.", "NTA, but I feel bad for your brother. I think, if I'm reading this and your comments to replies rightly, that it might be his girlfriend/wife that is alienating him from his family. She cuts you out from the wedding, and would have cut out your mother, too. I wonder how much your brother talks to your mom nowadays, or if she and her family are the monopoly here.", "NTA, at all. I probably wouldn't have even bothered sending an invitation if I was in your shoes. Relationships are two way streets and your brother wasn't putting any effort into his relationship with you so he shouldn't expect to be included in the big moments of your life. Enjoy your wedding and don't worry about him, let him deal with the consequences of his actions.", "NTA. You lost contact and he stopped caring.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s clearly looking for a reaction from you and you\u2019re not giving him one. Just let him be upset and if he doesn\u2019t come it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ll be too upset as you have very little relationship now anyways.", "NTA. Your brother thinks you owe him more than he's willing to give you. I can't imagine going for weeks without checking in on my siblings, let alone years. It's the height of entitlement for him to think that you should have contacted him when he never even reached out to find out how you were doing.\n\nI wouldn't concern myself with his attitude. He has his wife and his ego to keep him company.", "NTA. He's just mad because he just found out you have quite literally moved on with your life without him, and don't care if he's part of it. That he has been moved to the periphery of your life, much like where he was going to seat you at his wedding. He must've thought you were still pining for his approval back there at the ranch.

He treated you very poorly and his wife is a big meanie for cutting you out of their lives.", "NTA", "Nta and give him the same seat he gave u", "NTA and id invite only your bro and not his wife", "NTA. You were very level-headed and fired your immature brother's BS right back at him. The very fact that you invited him in the first place (after being uninvited from his wedding) makes you the bigger person. Them not attending will probably lead to a happier, and less stressful, wedding for you.", "Why did you even invite him to your wedding? After he disinvited you to his? NTA", "I don\u2019t see where his brother\u2019s wife really did much wrong. She was a bit stressed out about the wedding but didn\u2019t get the impression she took it out on OP. It sounds like the brother was the one doing that. Now how much was him being a conduit for his wife, we really won\u2019t know. But the only one who did anything wrong from what I read is the brother.", "His wife does not call me, but he made it obvious that they were her wishes, and he was more than happy to accommodate them.\n\nShe even said to my mom, point blank, that the only reason she didn't uninvite her too, was because it was planned for her to walk my brother down the aisle, and to have a dance with him.", "Right\u2026 that\u2019s an abusers tactic, to limit or eliminate contact with the victims friends/family", "You are right, I agree with you too but when you look from either side, I think the brother is the AH. It is clear that the OP was hurt from the start, yet she invited her brother. The COVID situation was already very complicated. Both sides should have been constructive here.", "She was the one that wanted me uninvited from the wedding, because my mom didn't like where they seated me, and she didn't even have the decency to uninvite me herself. She told my mom that the only reason she didn't push for her to not be uninvited too, was because they planned for mom to walk my brother down the aisle, and have a dance with him.", "Yeah it seems like Op and his wife don't seem to have had any form of communication during the process of the wedding. If she had a grievance she should have voiced it to OP in the first place however since this is coming from the brother and not from the wife I wonder if he's twisting things around.", "Okay that makes more sense Thank you for sharing. So I can say that your brother is less of a butthole now for the wedding situation but still a butthole for getting upset over not learning your engaged despite him never asking about your life and probably never contacting you. But I do wonder more about his wife's opinion about the matter. Considering that you know... She appeared to have a lot of grievances with you for some reason", "Oh I guess I misread it. It looked like it was his idea to me.", "And that's the weird part, we literally met once, when he introduced us, and I thought that we hit it off.\n\nAfter that meeting, I never did anything to upset her (gossip about her, try to turn my brother on her, be rude to her...), Just out of the blue demoted to a guest, and even then I didn't mind.\n\nThen when I was told about the seating arrangements, I did not complain, I did not raise a fuss, my mom did, and I got uninvited because of my mom's actions.\n\nAnd I would have moved on, except that when I stopped calling and arranging for us to meet, it was like he went LC with me, never called or texted, never asked mom about me, and even during COVID, I was the one that called to check up on him and his wife, even though they lived near family and had a safety net, while I was living all alone on the clear opposite side of the country.", "Something's wrong here. Either with Your brother or his wife. This appears to go a big deeper on their side than that surface of your side. On your side you got basically slowly uninvited from a wedding, Your brother's wedding, and before that point they put you in a corner away from the family. Which is very disrespectful but hey it is their wedding. I wonder if they got some heat online from other family members. Do you think they're trying to exclude you from the family in general? Or at least at that point? That's what I'm getting from the story and the post considering I am ignorant of the actual well issues within the family.", "You said you, your brother and your mom were very close at some point. When did it change?", "We have no other family at all, it's literally just me, my brother and my mom. She was an orphan, doesn't even know her family and was never adopted, then she came to the US on a student visa, married and settled here. As for my father, he up and left when I was 2, and then turned up dead 3 years later.", "I honestly don't know, we were very close while I was still living at home, and I thought we were close after I left, considering we would talk 3 times a week, and text all the time. But then, it turned out that sometime between me leaving and his wedding, I was the one to always call, or always send the first text, so when I stopped, the communication halted between us too.", "[deleted]", "Honestly I think he probably took your communication for granted It's considering you guys lived with each other for so long. Also it could be that he's trying subconsciously or consciously trying to distance himself and find himself and what that means without his family around. But honestly it's years since that point so maybe I'm just ignorant", "Also I hope you don't mind me spamming you with messages.. I'm just really curious", "Well when I tried to do that over COVID, it changed nothing, if I didn't call, he didn't, he never asked about me or my life.", "It's ok, you are not the first one to try and understand how this whole mess happened.", "Have you tried asking him about it? Telling him how you feel?", "No, I didn't. He made it pretty obvious that I didn't matter to him, and a petty part of me doesn't even want him to know that his indifference is bothering me", "NTA. Your story is very similar to mine and I\u2019m so sorry it happened to you. Strong sibling relationship, brother meets woman, she seems lovely, everything is peachy, then BAM! I\u2019ve done something horrible to offend and the sibling relationship is damaged. I did nothing wrong, you didn\u2019t either, and there are no missing missing reasons. But the girlfriend/wife is a jealous control freak and there\u2019s nothing you can do to fix that. \n\nMy brother is no longer with his wack job partner (they have kids though so coparenting is required) but my relationship with him will never recover. That\u2019s not my fault. I tried my best but he let her do this to us and hasn\u2019t made the effort to recover.  His loss. And your brother\u2019s loss too. I hope he sees that one day and apologizes to you.", "NTA\nIt has been 8 years. They have kept their distance from you and not cared enough about your life to even ask about you occasionally. Your brother made a choice not to show you that he cared. Seems like he is going to continue that path sadly. You were not obligated to contact him and tell him you were in a relationship or when you got engaged. It was nice of you to invite him.", "NTA! Your brother never asked you or anyone about you\u2026 he never cared enough to ask. i would not have even sent him an invitation to be honest", "NTA\n\nAsking you to step down when you didn\u2019t perform with the investment and excitement that she hoped for - that was fine.\n\nBut demoting you to a back table, and then univiting you because of your mother\u2019s behavior?\n\nThat\u2019s being an asshole.\n\nYou don\u2019t have a relationship because your brother made it pretty clear he wasn\u2019t invested in one - and he isn\u2019t entitled to announcements from you when he wants them.\n\nIf he wanted to know about your life all he needed to do was pick up the phone.", "Nope you are not. I\u2019m sorry your brother is an asshole.", "NTA.  The bad seating & disinviting you from the wedding is awful. SIL sounds pretty central to being the root cause of the estrangement between you & your brother. \n\nThing is, he reached out to you when he received your invitation. And was angry he didn\u2019t know you were engaged. Then angrier when you didn\u2019t talk him out of saying they wouldn\u2019t attend. \n\nThose aren\u2019t the actions of a brother who has no feelings for his sister & is fine with her being out of his life. \n\nSo isn\u2019t it worth telling him how hurtful the seating & painful being disinvited was? And ask why his lack of contact? Clearly both of you are troubled by the lack of relationship. Now\u2019s an opportunity to get some answers & see if he will mend it. There\u2019s nothing to lose by it! And btw people in unhappy marriages often go LC or NC with friends & family. \n\nBest of luck OP & hope you have a wonderful wedding!", "NTA.  Your brother and his wife are both AHs.  I think the bride's reason for taking you out of the wedding party was pretty weak, but sitting the groom's SISTER at a back table with some of the groom's coworkers was beyond shitty and was, of course, done to make you feel unwelcome.  I assume there was never an apology from your brother.  I wouldn't have reached out or shared any news with him either, after what he and his wife pulled at their wedding.  It is too bad your brother won't be at your wedding, but on the other hand, who knows what his wife  would pull if they went?  You might be better off.", "Whyd you even invite him if yall dont talk? ESH.", "NTA. Is your name Karma, by chance..?", "You\u2019re not the a hole I come from a huge family of eight other brothers and sisters I never told any of them that I was getting married and I only had my parents and my sister as my maid of honor at my wedding. They have never accepted me throughout my life and you know what I don\u2019t really care you do what you have to do in your life, and if they don\u2019t accept it, that\u2019s their fault I say bravo to you", "NTA", "NTAH", "NTA and actually, quite impressive. It was the most calm, light touch, on-point letting him hoist himself on his own petard I've read in a long while.", "NTA. Regardless if your brother is just an asshole or a completely p whipped moron whose letting his wife alienate hom from his family, it seems like he's realizing that his behavior definitely has consequences. If you want to, send him a message outlining his behavior, him pushing you away, and his outright lack of communication on his end, but if this truly is the hill he wants to die on, he can learn the hard way", "Could it be that he's a bit jealous of OP for getting away and going out on her own? Brother hung around and found a wife. This just made the gap larger. Brother would like to have OP back, but the new wife is like a boulder rolled into the gap; there's no way brother could fly free now, even if he wanted to (which he never really did).\n\nSo NTA.  Your brother might need some kindness tho.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re too kind, Id keep the same energy & not invite them. 11 years passed & he hasn\u2019t reach out to you.", "NTA. I have no idea why he thinks he\u2019s entitled to any information about you after the shabby way you were treated by him and his wife, and the lack of effort to even keep up with the broad strokes of your life. Sounds like the path you\u2019ve taken is the path of least stress and heartache for you, and as someone with a shitty brother, I applaud you.", "NTA at all. I have two brothers who NEVER reach out to me so I stopped reaching out to them. Now they complain to our mum that I think I'm too good to talk to them \ud83d\ude44", "NTA, I have a similar problem with two of my siblings & my mother (luckily I still have 1 sibling & we talk regularly) but I got fed up with always feeling like the one keeping things going as well. It's his fault he didn't know not yours, just like it's my siblings & mum's fault if they don't know what's happening in my life, all they have to do is reach out and ask.", "NTA. These are the consequences of his actions.", "First of all, congratulations! I think your brother\u2019s wife loves the fact that he only has 2 relatives. She gets all the holidays and no major family input on their lives from his side. The comment that she would even uninvited your mom if she weren\u2019t walking him down the isle says that she knows exactly what she\u2019s doing. Sadly, your brother is blind to her ulterior motives. \nWe always here about abusers that isolate women but forget that it happens to men too. She has every intention of isolating him from you and your mom. I can guarantee she\u2019s making you out to be the villain for not contacting him. Unfortunately, until he realizes it, there is nothing you and your mom can do is live your lives and hold tight to each other. Good luck and have an amazing wedding!", "Love him getting even angrier when she told him it\u2019s his choice whether to come or not. AHs like this want you to beg and say I\u2019m so sorry please come  and when you don\u2019t give them that they get so angry.", "I can't believe OP invited him at all.  I probably wouldn't have.", "NTA.  Your relationship is one sided.  You shouldn't always be the one reaching out.  The phone/text works both ways.  If he really cared he would have reached out.  Doesn't sound like you're missing out not having him 8n your life.  Congratulations on your engagement and wedding.", "I have to wonder if your SIL was behind all this change in him. She doesn't understand family dynamics or didn't like that he had other important women in his life, so she started causing problems between you all and manipulated him into cutting you and your mom off. Is he that easily manipulated? It's such a strange situation otherwise, especially when you, him, and your mom were close. I'm guessing you have no connection to their kids either?\n\nI think you should share this post with him. Let's see how he reacts to all this. Maybe this will be the wake-up call he needs, and how he's mistreating you so much, maybe also your mom. And he should read the responses too. NTA", "Sounds like she/they were attempting to antagonise you and provoke you into confronting them about the shit treatment they were subjecting you to so that they\u2019d have an excuse to cut you out. Then you didn\u2019t react, but your mum did, which shit them off even more because it made them look really bad and like horrible people. The less you react, the more shitty they get. Brother sounds upset that you don\u2019t care enough about his opinion. \n\nIt\u2019s a shitty situation, but you\u2019re behaving better than I ever would in the same scenario!", "His wife happened.  \n\nNTA"]}
