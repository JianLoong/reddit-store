She asked me to be a bridesmaid and I accepted, but when she told me that their wedding date will be close to my finals, I warned her that I might not be able to do everything she needs me to do. She was very sweet, and said that that's ok, she just wanted me to be involved.\n\n3 months before the wedding, my brother called me, he said that my \"lack of involvement and enthusiasm for being a bridesmaid\" was stressing his fianc\u00e9e, and that they decided that I should just be a normal guest. I said that that was fine, apologized to him, then called her to apologize too.\n\nFast foreward to when they finalized the seating chart, and apparently I was seated in a back table, with some of my brother's coworkers, not even close to the family table.

Have a great wedding.", "NTA the audacity! Okay But I do have a question about your brother and his wife. His wife doesn't seem to be doing much of anything. I just wonder if his wife truly felt stressed because of you or because of their wedding and he was trying to twist it to put all the blame on you. Did other instances like this appear in your childhood or young adult lives?", "NTA.  \nIf he cared, he'd know. The biggest AH here is your brother.", "It\u2019s amazing what happens when you really look at a relationship and. Who reaches out.  Who actually asks about you and events happening in your life rather than it all about them\n\nI love the fact his words could be used against him in this situation and  the petty it\u2019s your choice \n\nNta", "NTA\n\nLook, you told them you couldn't be heavily involved because you were elsewhere and in school. They said that was okay, but then punished you for it.\n\nAnd you're right: If your brother wanted to know about your life, he could have asked at any point.\n\nHe seems like a jerk at this point, TBH.\n\nCongrats on your wedding. Don't worry about him.", "NTA, but I feel bad for your brother. I think, if I'm reading this and your comments to replies rightly, that it might be his girlfriend/wife that is alienating him from his family. She cuts you out from the wedding, and would have cut out your mother, too. I wonder how much your brother talks to your mom nowadays, or if she and her family are the monopoly here.", "NTA, at all. I probably wouldn't have even bothered sending an invitation if I was in your shoes. Relationships are two way streets and your brother wasn't putting any effort into his relationship with you so he shouldn't expect to be included in the big moments of your life. Enjoy your wedding and don't worry about him, let him deal with the consequences of his actions.", "NTA. You lost contact and he stopped caring.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s clearly looking for a reaction from you and you\u2019re not giving him one. Just let him be upset and if he doesn\u2019t come it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019ll be too upset as you have very little relationship now anyways.", "NTA. Your brother thinks you owe him more than he's willing to give you. I can't imagine going for weeks without checking in on my siblings, let alone years. It's the height of entitlement for him to think that you should have contacted him when he never even reached out to find out how you were doing.\n\nI wouldn't concern myself with his attitude. He has his wife and his ego to keep him company.", "NTA. He's just mad because he just found out you have quite literally moved on with your life without him, and don't care if he's part of it. That he has been moved to the periphery of your life, much like where he was going to seat you at his wedding. He must've thought you were still pining for his approval back there at the ranch. Bummer for him.", "NTA\n\nRelationships are a two way street.", "You are both assholes. Especially for that \u201cI don\u2019t want to stress you\u201d comment. Talk about holding onto a grudge. Sounds like you were waiting years for an opportunity to use if.\nYou are adults and you are both antagonizing each other and one upping each other in terms of being AH. \nIs he more of an asshole? Yeah, he should have made more of an effort to contact you.

He treated you very poorly and his wife is a big meanie for cutting you out of their lives.", "NTA", "Nta and give him the same seat he gave u", "NTA and id invite only your bro and not his wife", "NTA. You were very level-headed and fired your immature brother's BS right back at him. The very fact that you invited him in the first place (after being uninvited from his wedding) makes you the bigger person. Them not attending will probably lead to a happier, and less stressful, wedding for you.", "Why did you even invite him to your wedding? After he disinvited you to his? NTA", "I don\u2019t see where his brother\u2019s wife really did much wrong. She was a bit stressed out about the wedding but didn\u2019t get the impression she took it out on OP. It sounds like the brother was the one doing that. Now how much was him being a conduit for his wife, we really won\u2019t know. But the only one who did anything wrong from what I read is the brother.", "His wife does not call me, but he made it obvious that they were her wishes, and he was more than happy to accommodate them.\n\nShe even said to my mom, point blank, that the only reason she didn't uninvite her too, was because it was planned for her to walk my brother down the aisle, and to have a dance with him.", "Right\u2026 that\u2019s an abusers tactic, to limit or eliminate contact with the victims friends/family", "You are right, I agree with you too but when you look from either side, I think the brother is the AH. It is clear that the OP was hurt from the start, yet she invited her brother. The COVID situation was already very complicated. Both sides should have been constructive here.", "She was the one that wanted me uninvited from the wedding, because my mom didn't like where they seated me, and she didn't even have the decency to uninvite me herself. She told my mom that the only reason she didn't push for her to not be uninvited too, was because they planned for mom to walk my brother down the aisle, and have a dance with him.", "Yeah it seems like Op and his wife don't seem to have had any form of communication during the process of the wedding. If she had a grievance she should have voiced it to OP in the first place however since this is coming from the brother and not from the wife I wonder if he's twisting things around.", "Okay that makes more sense Thank you for sharing. So I can say that your brother is less of a butthole now for the wedding situation but still a butthole for getting upset over not learning your engaged despite him never asking about your life and probably never contacting you. But I do wonder more about his wife's opinion about the matter. Considering that you know... She appeared to have a lot of grievances with you for some reason", "Oh I guess I misread it. It looked like it was his idea to me.", "And that's the weird part, we literally met once, when he introduced us, and I thought that we hit it off.\n\nAfter that meeting, I never did anything to upset her (gossip about her, try to turn my brother on her, be rude to her...), Just out of the blue demoted to a guest, and even then I didn't mind.\n\nThen when I was told about the seating arrangements, I did not complain, I did not raise a fuss, my mom did, and I got uninvited because of my mom's actions.\n\nAnd I would have moved on, except that when I stopped calling and arranging for us to meet, it was like he went LC with me, never called or texted, never asked mom about me, and even during COVID, I was the one that called to check up on him and his wife, even though they lived near family and had a safety net, while I was living all alone on the clear opposite side of the country.", "Something's wrong here. Either with Your brother or his wife. This appears to go a big deeper on their side than that surface of your side. On your side you got basically slowly uninvited from a wedding, Your brother's wedding, and before that point they put you in a corner away from the family. Which is very disrespectful but hey it is their wedding. I wonder if they got some heat online from other family members. Do you think they're trying to exclude you from the family in general? Or at least at that point? That's what I'm getting from the story and the post considering I am ignorant of the actual well issues within the family.", "You said you, your brother and your mom were very close at some point. When did it change?", "We have no other family at all, it's literally just me, my brother and my mom. She was an orphan, doesn't even know her family and was never adopted, then she came to the US on a student visa, married and settled here. As for my father, he up and left when I was 2, and then turned up dead 3 years later.", "I honestly don't know, we were very close while I was still living at home, and I thought we were close after I left, considering we would talk 3 times a week, and text all the time. But then, it turned out that sometime between me leaving and his wedding, I was the one to always call, or always send the first text, so when I stopped, the communication halted between us too.", "[deleted]", "Honestly I think he probably took your communication for granted It's considering you guys lived with each other for so long. Also it could be that he's trying subconsciously or consciously trying to distance himself and find himself and what that means without his family around. But honestly it's years since that point so maybe I'm just ignorant", "Also I hope you don't mind me spamming you with messages.. I'm just really curious", "Well when I tried to do that over COVID, it changed nothing, if I didn't call, he didn't, he never asked about me or my life.", "It's ok, you are not the first one to try and understand how this whole mess happened.", "Have you tried asking him about it? Telling him how you feel?", "No, I didn't. He made it pretty obvious that I didn't matter to him, and a petty part of me doesn't even want him to know that his indifference is bothering me"]}
