Let's get down to it.\n\nSo my original AITA was about showing favoritism for my daughter and financially hurting my son. The comments went way far from that topic. It was interesting for me. For the people who sent me aggressive messages,  not cool.\n\nSome questions to be addressed.\n\n1. Why would I just not pay for everything?\n\nI am trying to teach my kids about financial responsibility. Money has value, and nothing is given without work.(I bet if my son posted his view, you would call him entitled AH)\n\n2. But they were so young when they started gambling with money in the stock market.\n\nTrue. But they have grown up since then. Yes, they are still kids. But maturity does not just develop at 25 like some people on here think.\n\n3. You gave them their college fund to waste.\n\nNo. College fund has always been secured and untouched unless I was putting money in it. They used allowance money.\n\n3. Why are you not giving him a good start in life?\n\nHe has a better start than the majority of people.\n\nSo, I talked to my daughter. She said she would be upset if I just gave him the money. She worked hard and values her time and effort. I agreed that would be a bad idea. But we came up with 3 options (I added a 4th) to present him/my ex-wife. All of them had rules attached, and the same amount would be given to my daughter. Rules grades, housing rules, and behavior\n\n1. He sells his car and some of his shoe collections to save money and put it towards the fund, and I will help him again to make passive income.\n\n2. He picks a lower college that is more cost effective but still a good school. He gets a job, and I will match his pay.\n\n3. I just give him the money. But as a loan. 0%interest, but he has to pay back in a timely manner. (Money, if paid back, will go back to him in the future. Down payment or wedding or something)\n\n4. Ex and family put in the difference in the account.\n\nI layed it all out for him. My ex and him did not like it. So I asked my ex why she is pushing this so much and why she has not put any money into the account since we originally opened it. There were excuses , and she finally said, \"I have to save money to my daughter(6 almost 7F). Unless you want to set up a fund for her as well.\" (I am setting things up with MY youngest daughter (3f) the same way I did with my twins. I'm not doing it for her daughter)\n\nAnyway, I have given him a few weeks to figure out what he wants. He acknowledged that I was right. He was unfair to his sister about the way he went about things and will do better in the future. He picked a modified version of option 2. He is still going to his #4 pick, is looking for a job, sold some shoes, and said he will be responsible for housing costs. He apologized to me and his sister. I hope he keeps working hard towards his goals.\n\nTLDR; Gave my son options. He picked and negotiated it. He will go to a collage he wants to. Ex-wife is pissed at me.", "created_utc": 1683596684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cbogb/aita_for_showing_favoritism_for_my_daughter_and/", "score": 213, "replies": ["It\u2019s unfortunate your ex had an ulterior motive but glad your son, even if reluctantly, came around to why you can\u2019t just had him money when he was \u201creckless\u201d with it. Hopefully this will become a lesson about saving/investing AND spending on fun things cause I truly believe the best times are when you balance both in your life. Congrats on the resolution", "NTA. Looks like an excellent plan to me.  Who cares if EX is pissed?", "Good job on being a reliable father, and good job to your son on growing up pretty quickly since your last post.\n\nHere's to hoping the lesson sticks.  Nothing wrong with spending and enjoying your money (you can't take it with you,) but frivolity equals destitution if you ain't already rich.", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1250pyx/aita_for_showing_favoritism_for_my_daughter_and/?ref=share&ref_source=link)", "Yeah. It was clear, even from the other post that NTA. You want your kids to be self sufficient and just giving him money without working for it won\u2019t teach him anything otherwise he\u2019s going to expect you to bail him out and it definitely isn\u2019t fair for either one of your daughters. Especially your 17yo cause she worked really really hard. And good for her. Idk why people didn\u2019t see that in the other post.\n\nYou weren\u2019t financially hurting your son. You were trying to help him before he said he didn\u2019t want the help. \n\nNTA.", "I'd negotiate the option of  job and top college (not #4 college like he chose).   Wouldn't a job alleviate your concern about paying for all of his college -- you want to teach him money has value and nothing is given without work?  Why not help pay for a top school at that point?", "The ending of your original post still makes you sound like an AH. \n\nI get that he wanted his spending money to spend when he wanted instead of investing in it like your daughter but you\u2019re still a bit of an AH for suggesting that he should\u2019ve sold his car and his shoe collection. \n\nNTA for the other options but it\u2019s obvious that you favor your daughter over your son. Might be that it\u2019s bc you said in your OG post that he takes after his mother while your daughter takes after you.", "Well his daughter clearly wants to be around her dad because they get along, while the son is an entitled brat who likes materialistic items. Also shoe collections are stupid, and he should have gotten a more reasonably priced car. The ex was clearly trying to get money out of him as well rather than being a parent and giving her son money instead of begging dad.", "Dang I was hoping he would pick #3.  As someone with student loans that is a sweet deal!", "In what age did you let them start investing the money?", "Well done to you and your son. Bonus you managed to get the ex passed off", "Im sorry, but its wildly inappropriate to include your daughter in these decisions. The discussion you had with your son did not have to and should not have been run through your daughter first. Shes your daughter, not your partner. Regardless of giving money to your son or not, you very clearly favor your daughter. We get it, shes your carbon copy. I wonder if your son chose to live with your ex bc unbeknownst to you, your favortism shines through. If its half as obvious irl as it is in these posts, your son probably feels terrible about himself around you. Your ex wife being such an asshole might make you a bit oblivious to how you treat your son. If you didnt realize, you treat him like hes an idiot disguised as  \"teaching life lessons\". You can do that respectfully while also not involving his golden child sister.\n\nEta i also want to point out how you talk about your kids. Its very sad. You use words that all have positive connotations to describe your daughter, and you use words with negative connotations to describe both your son and ex. I dont think you even realize that you do it \u2639\ufe0f", "YTA still.  It's very clear you favor your daughter over your son.  What's worse is that you underfunded their college funds despite bragging in your original post about how you can afford to send them to any college they would want to go to.  If I were your son I would go no contact with you.", "You came here to show us how you are morally superior and how even your inferior son has now seen your shining light (In your mind that will show how the vast majority calling you an asshole are objectively wrong as you are a superior being).  \n\n\n>Anyway, I have given him a few weeks to figure out what he wants. He acknowledged that I was right. He was unfair to his sister about the way he went about things and will do better in the future.\n\nHe didn't genuinely acknowledge anything, you strong armed him because you have leverage over him.\n\nIt is so clear how much you favor your mini-me daughter and despise your son that, in your words, takes after your ex.  \n\n\nYou were already majorly TA based on your earlier post. This update makes my verdict YTAx10", "You\u2019re more generous than most. You do favor your daughter, but in terms of the money, they were both presented with the exact same situation and they made different choices with what to do with their money. This wasn\u2019t dependent on who does better at school, or likes academics more. You didn\u2019t give your daughter more money because you have more in common. You gave them the same stuff and he used it differently and now can see the results.", "Before their teen years is when I first showed them.", "When he was picking schools, he picked the top three that had more of a \"party environment.\" His #4 school is more education focused and better for the degree he wants to get or just a better program.", "but he gets to go to his #4 school and other kids have it worse!\n\n/s", "My grandmother would give my sisters and I money every year during tax season and yell at us for not giving it to her to put into a bank account.  She would openly praise my middle sister for saving her money and then openly insult my youngest sister for spending her money.  I'm sure OP's son has probably heard his father talk negatively about him numerous times."]}
