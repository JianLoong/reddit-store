Let's get down to it.\n\nSo my original AITA was about showing favoritism for my daughter and financially hurting my son. The comments went way far from that topic. It was interesting for me. For the people who sent me aggressive messages,  not cool.\n\nSome questions to be addressed.\n\n1. Why would I just not pay for everything?\n\nI am trying to teach my kids about financial responsibility. Money has value, and nothing is given without work.(I bet if my son posted his view, you would call him entitled AH)\n\n2. But they were so young when they started gambling with money in the stock market.\n\nTrue. But they have grown up since then. Yes, they are still kids. But maturity does not just develop at 25 like some people on here think.\n\n3. You gave them their college fund to waste.\n\nNo. College fund has always been secured and untouched unless I was putting money in it. They used allowance money.\n\n3. Why are you not giving him a good start in life?\n\nHe has a better start than the majority of people.\n\nSo, I talked to my daughter. She said she would be upset if I just gave him the money. She worked hard and values her time and effort. I agreed that would be a bad idea. But we came up with 3 options (I added a 4th) to present him/my ex-wife. All of them had rules attached, and the same amount would be given to my daughter. Rules grades, housing rules, and behavior\n\n1. He sells his car and some of his shoe collections to save money and put it towards the fund, and I will help him again to make passive income.\n\n2. He picks a lower college that is more cost effective but still a good school. He gets a job, and I will match his pay.\n\n3. I just give him the money. But as a loan. 0%interest, but he has to pay back in a timely manner. (Money, if paid back, will go back to him in the future. Down payment or wedding or something)\n\n4. Ex and family put in the difference in the account.\n\nI layed it all out for him. My ex and him did not like it. So I asked my ex why she is pushing this so much and why she has not put any money into the account since we originally opened it. There were excuses , and she finally said, \"I have to save money to my daughter(6 almost 7F). Unless you want to set up a fund for her as well.\" (I am setting things up with MY youngest daughter (3f) the same way I did with my twins. I'm not doing it for her daughter)\n\nAnyway, I have given him a few weeks to figure out what he wants. He acknowledged that I was right. He was unfair to his sister about the way he went about things and will do better in the future. He picked a modified version of option 2. He is still going to his #4 pick, is looking for a job, sold some shoes, and said he will be responsible for housing costs. He apologized to me and his sister. I hope he keeps working hard towards his goals.\n\nTLDR; Gave my son options. He picked and negotiated it. He will go to a collage he wants to. Ex-wife is pissed at me.", "created_utc": 1683596684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cbogb/aita_for_showing_favoritism_for_my_daughter_and/", "score": 134, "replies": ["It\u2019s unfortunate your ex had an ulterior motive but glad your son, even if reluctantly, came around to why you can\u2019t just had him money when he was \u201creckless\u201d with it. Hopefully this will become a lesson about saving/investing AND spending on fun things cause I truly believe the best times are when you balance both in your life. Congrats on the resolution", "NTA. Looks like an excellent plan to me.  Who cares if EX is pissed?", "Good job on being a reliable father, and good job to your son on growing up pretty quickly since your last post.\n\nHere's to hoping the lesson sticks.  Nothing wrong with spending and enjoying your money (you can't take it with you,) but frivolity equals destitution if you ain't already rich.", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1250pyx/aita_for_showing_favoritism_for_my_daughter_and/?ref=share&ref_source=link)", "Yeah. It was clear, even from the other post that NTA. You want your kids to be self sufficient and just giving him money without working for it won\u2019t teach him anything otherwise he\u2019s going to expect you to bail him out and it definitely isn\u2019t fair for either one of your daughters. Especially your 17yo cause she worked really really hard. And good for her. Idk why people didn\u2019t see that in the other post.\n\nYou weren\u2019t financially hurting your son. You were trying to help him before he said he didn\u2019t want the help. \n\nNTA.", "I'd negotiate the option of  job and top college (not #4 college like he chose).   Wouldn't a job alleviate your concern about paying for all of his college -- you want to teach him money has value and nothing is given without work?  Why not help pay for a top school at that point?", "The ending of your original post still makes you sound like an AH. \n\nI get that he wanted his spending money to spend when he wanted instead of investing in it like your daughter but you\u2019re still a bit of an AH for suggesting that he should\u2019ve sold his car and his shoe collection. \n\nNTA for the other options but it\u2019s obvious that you favor your daughter over your son. Might be that it\u2019s bc you said in your OG post that he takes after his mother while your daughter takes after you.", "Well his daughter clearly wants to be around her dad because they get along, while the son is an entitled brat who likes materialistic items. Also shoe collections are stupid, and he should have gotten a more reasonably priced car. The ex was clearly trying to get money out of him as well rather than being a parent and giving her son money instead of begging dad.", "Dang I was hoping he would pick #3.  As someone with student loans that is a sweet deal!"]}
