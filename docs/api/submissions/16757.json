Let's get down to it.\n\nSo my original AITA was about showing favoritism for my daughter and financially hurting my son. The comments went way far from that topic. It was interesting for me. For the people who sent me aggressive messages,  not cool.\n\nSome questions to be addressed.\n\n1. Why would I just not pay for everything?\n\nI am trying to teach my kids about financial responsibility. Money has value, and nothing is given without work.(I bet if my son posted his view, you would call him entitled AH)\n\n2. But they were so young when they started gambling with money in the stock market.\n\nTrue. But they have grown up since then. Yes, they are still kids. But maturity does not just develop at 25 like some people on here think.\n\n3. You gave them their college fund to waste.\n\nNo. College fund has always been secured and untouched unless I was putting money in it. They used allowance money.\n\n3. Why are you not giving him a good start in life?\n\nHe has a better start than the majority of people.\n\nSo, I talked to my daughter. She said she would be upset if I just gave him the money. She worked hard and values her time and effort. I agreed that would be a bad idea. But we came up with 3 options (I added a 4th) to present him/my ex-wife. All of them had rules attached, and the same amount would be given to my daughter. Rules grades, housing rules, and behavior\n\n1. He sells his car and some of his shoe collections to save money and put it towards the fund, and I will help him again to make passive income.\n\n2. He picks a lower college that is more cost effective but still a good school. He gets a job, and I will match his pay.\n\n3. I just give him the money. But as a loan. 0%interest, but he has to pay back in a timely manner. (Money, if paid back, will go back to him in the future. Down payment or wedding or something)\n\n4. Ex and family put in the difference in the account.\n\nI layed it all out for him. My ex and him did not like it. So I asked my ex why she is pushing this so much and why she has not put any money into the account since we originally opened it. There were excuses , and she finally said, \"I have to save money to my daughter(6 almost 7F). Unless you want to set up a fund for her as well.\" (I am setting things up with MY youngest daughter (3f) the same way I did with my twins. I'm not doing it for her daughter)\n\nAnyway, I have given him a few weeks to figure out what he wants. He acknowledged that I was right. He was unfair to his sister about the way he went about things and will do better in the future. He picked a modified version of option 2. He is still going to his #4 pick, is looking for a job, sold some shoes, and said he will be responsible for housing costs. He apologized to me and his sister. I hope he keeps working hard towards his goals.\n\nTLDR; Gave my son options. He picked and negotiated it. He will go to a collage he wants to. Ex-wife is pissed at me.", "created_utc": 1683596684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cbogb/aita_for_showing_favoritism_for_my_daughter_and/", "score": 818, "replies": ["It\u2019s unfortunate your ex had an ulterior motive but glad your son, even if reluctantly, came around to why you can\u2019t just had him money when he was \u201creckless\u201d with it.

I wonder if your son chose to live with your ex bc unbeknownst to you, your favortism shines through.

He acknowledged that I was right. He was unfair to his sister about the way he went about things and will do better in the future.\n\nHe didn't genuinely acknowledge anything, you strong armed him because you have leverage over him.\n\nIt is so clear how much you favor your mini-me daughter and despise your son that, in your words, takes after your ex.  \n\n\nYou were already majorly TA based on your earlier post. This update makes my verdict YTAx10", "You\u2019re more generous than most. You do favor your daughter, but in terms of the money, they were both presented with the exact same situation and they made different choices with what to do with their money.

If you have as much money as you said to be able to send them to any college for the full time then why didn\u2019t you just put more money into their secured college funds?

But I don\u2019t understand only saving enough for 2 years at a good college and expecting them to figure out the rest when you\u2019re perfectly capable of covering all of it. \nI still don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA but I\u2019m genuinely curious because I also have 3 kids and while we live comfortably I know we will not be able to pay for all 4 years of college for each of them, it\u2019s just not financially possible for us.

Most of the decisions *feel* like ones I may have made, and I get worried.\n\nThen updates like this happen, where it turns out that the original situation wasn't nearly as unfair as feared, and there's a reasonable path forward, one that also feels like options I would have tried.\n\nSo glad it's working out for you and your kids, OP!", "YTA, you had two children gamble and are punishing one because the other got lucky. College isn't the time to \"teach responsibility,\" it's a decision with enormous consequence that will invariably alter the trajectory of both of their entire adult lives.

Yes, he, as so many people pointed out, is still a kid. My daughter does the same thing. But they learn from these decisions and mistakes. \n\nI'm not trying to make excuses. But there is a much bigger picture in the relationships between us all. I may seem like the AH for the way I said some things. But trying to keep things within the character count is hard. Also, while trying to be vague at the same time, it might not have allowed me to convey the information in a neutral way as possible. \n\nExamples are the way I describe my kids and how my daughter doesn't put on much makeup. Those were two generalized ways to describe them where most people would get the idea while not spending a bunch of time describing them. With the makeup, I see my mistake.

Its one thing to teach your kids the market, its another to introduce them to it then tie real world consequences to their interest in it and performance. They were EIGHT when they started. Its insane to think even a 14 or 16 year old would understand the gravity of whats being put upon them. Fyi bc im betting a lot of people dont know this, you can't legally trade securities until youre 18. Youre not able to open a brokerage account until youre 18. So the dad was trading the kids picks in his own account or he opened custodial accounts which still means hes trading for the kids as hes the owner of the account bc again, minors cannot trade stock.\n\nThere was a post here a while about about a mom who made a deal with her 12 year old daughter that shed pay for the in ground pool she wanted when she was older. At 16 mom went to collect and kid, husband, and fam said she was an asshole. She came here and got absolutely eviscerated.  So you cant ask a teenager to pay for a pool she promised to pay for, but sure ask 8 year olds to grasp trading securities and tie that to their college education....all of a sudden thats ok. This sub is dumb.", "Omg yes! It definitely makes me grateful. There are some train wrecks out there. Pure dumpster fires. \ud83e\udd23"]}
