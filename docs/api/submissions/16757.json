Let's get down to it.\n\nSo my original AITA was about showing favoritism for my daughter and financially hurting my son. The comments went way far from that topic. It was interesting for me. For the people who sent me aggressive messages,  not cool.\n\nSome questions to be addressed.\n\n1. Why would I just not pay for everything?\n\nI am trying to teach my kids about financial responsibility. Money has value, and nothing is given without work.(I bet if my son posted his view, you would call him entitled AH)\n\n2. But they were so young when they started gambling with money in the stock market.\n\nTrue. But they have grown up since then. Yes, they are still kids. But maturity does not just develop at 25 like some people on here think.\n\n3. You gave them their college fund to waste.\n\nNo. College fund has always been secured and untouched unless I was putting money in it. They used allowance money.\n\n3. Why are you not giving him a good start in life?\n\nHe has a better start than the majority of people.\n\nSo, I talked to my daughter. She said she would be upset if I just gave him the money. She worked hard and values her time and effort. I agreed that would be a bad idea. But we came up with 3 options (I added a 4th) to present him/my ex-wife. All of them had rules attached, and the same amount would be given to my daughter. Rules grades, housing rules, and behavior\n\n1. He sells his car and some of his shoe collections to save money and put it towards the fund, and I will help him again to make passive income.\n\n2. He picks a lower college that is more cost effective but still a good school. He gets a job, and I will match his pay.\n\n3. I just give him the money. But as a loan. 0%interest, but he has to pay back in a timely manner. (Money, if paid back, will go back to him in the future. Down payment or wedding or something)\n\n4. Ex and family put in the difference in the account.\n\nI layed it all out for him. My ex and him did not like it. So I asked my ex why she is pushing this so much and why she has not put any money into the account since we originally opened it. There were excuses , and she finally said, \"I have to save money to my daughter(6 almost 7F). Unless you want to set up a fund for her as well.\" (I am setting things up with MY youngest daughter (3f) the same way I did with my twins. I'm not doing it for her daughter)\n\nAnyway, I have given him a few weeks to figure out what he wants. He acknowledged that I was right. He was unfair to his sister about the way he went about things and will do better in the future. He picked a modified version of option 2. He is still going to his #4 pick, is looking for a job, sold some shoes, and said he will be responsible for housing costs. He apologized to me and his sister. I hope he keeps working hard towards his goals.\n\nTLDR; Gave my son options. He picked and negotiated it. He will go to a collage he wants to. Ex-wife is pissed at me.", "created_utc": 1683596684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cbogb/aita_for_showing_favoritism_for_my_daughter_and/", "score": 507, "replies": ["It\u2019s unfortunate your ex had an ulterior motive but glad your son, even if reluctantly, came around to why you can\u2019t just had him money when he was \u201creckless\u201d with it.

Looks like an excellent plan to me.  Who cares if EX is pissed?", "Good job on being a reliable father, and good job to your son on growing up pretty quickly since your last post.\n\nHere's to hoping the lesson sticks.  Nothing wrong with spending and enjoying your money (you can't take it with you,) but frivolity equals destitution if you ain't already rich.", "[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1250pyx/aita_for_showing_favoritism_for_my_daughter_and/?ref=share&ref_source=link)", "Yeah. It was clear, even from the other post that NTA. You want your kids to be self sufficient and just giving him money without working for it won\u2019t teach him anything otherwise he\u2019s going to expect you to bail him out and it definitely isn\u2019t fair for either one of your daughters. Especially your 17yo cause she worked really really hard. And good for her. Idk why people didn\u2019t see that in the other post.\n\nYou weren\u2019t financially hurting your son. You were trying to help him before he said he didn\u2019t want the help. \n\nNTA.", "I'd negotiate the option of  job and top college (not #4 college like he chose).   Wouldn't a job alleviate your concern about paying for all of his college -- you want to teach him money has value and nothing is given without work?  Why not help pay for a top school at that point?", "The ending of your original post still makes you sound like an AH. \n\nI get that he wanted his spending money to spend when he wanted instead of investing in it like your daughter but you\u2019re still a bit of an AH for suggesting that he should\u2019ve sold his car and his shoe collection. \n\nNTA for the other options but it\u2019s obvious that you favor your daughter over your son. Might be that it\u2019s bc you said in your OG post that he takes after his mother while your daughter takes after you.", "Well his daughter clearly wants to be around her dad because they get along, while the son is an entitled brat who likes materialistic items. Also shoe collections are stupid, and he should have gotten a more reasonably priced car. The ex was clearly trying to get money out of him as well rather than being a parent and giving her son money instead of begging dad.", "Dang I was hoping he would pick #3.  As someone with student loans that is a sweet deal!", "In what age did you let them start investing the money?", "Well done to you and your son. Bonus you managed to get the ex passed off", "Im sorry, but its wildly inappropriate to include your daughter in these decisions. The discussion you had with your son did not have to and should not have been run through your daughter first. Shes your daughter, not your partner. Regardless of giving money to your son or not, you very clearly favor your daughter. We get it, shes your carbon copy. I wonder if your son chose to live with your ex bc unbeknownst to you, your favortism shines through. If its half as obvious irl as it is in these posts, your son probably feels terrible about himself around you. Your ex wife being such an asshole might make you a bit oblivious to how you treat your son. If you didnt realize, you treat him like hes an idiot disguised as  \"teaching life lessons\". You can do that respectfully while also not involving his golden child sister.\n\nEta i also want to point out how you talk about your kids. Its very sad. You use words that all have positive connotations to describe your daughter, and you use words with negative connotations to describe both your son and ex. I dont think you even realize that you do it \u2639\ufe0f", "YTA still.  It's very clear you favor your daughter over your son.  What's worse is that you underfunded their college funds despite bragging in your original post about how you can afford to send them to any college they would want to go to.  If I were your son I would go no contact with you.", "You came here to show us how you are morally superior and how even your inferior son has now seen your shining light (In your mind that will show how the vast majority calling you an asshole are objectively wrong as you are a superior being).  \n\n\n>Anyway, I have given him a few weeks to figure out what he wants. He acknowledged that I was right. He was unfair to his sister about the way he went about things and will do better in the future.\n\nHe didn't genuinely acknowledge anything, you strong armed him because you have leverage over him.\n\nIt is so clear how much you favor your mini-me daughter and despise your son that, in your words, takes after your ex.  \n\n\nYou were already majorly TA based on your earlier post. This update makes my verdict YTAx10", "You\u2019re more generous than most. You do favor your daughter, but in terms of the money, they were both presented with the exact same situation and they made different choices with what to do with their money. This wasn\u2019t dependent on who does better at school, or likes academics more. You didn\u2019t give your daughter more money because you have more in common. You gave them the same stuff and he used it differently and now can see the results.", "Before their teen years is when I first showed them.", "When he was picking schools, he picked the top three that had more of a \"party environment.\" His #4 school is more education focused and better for the degree he wants to get or just a better program.", "but he gets to go to his #4 school and other kids have it worse!\n\n/s", "My grandmother would give my sisters and I money every year during tax season and yell at us for not giving it to her to put into a bank account.  She would openly praise my middle sister for saving her money and then openly insult my youngest sister for spending her money.  I'm sure OP's son has probably heard his father talk negatively about him numerous times.", ">But maturity does not just develop at 25 like some people on here think.\n\nYoungsters on reddit will either respond with \"brains are not fully developed until 23\" or \"back off, 18 is an adult\" depending on if responsibility is asked of them or the freedom of someone making decisions is in question.\n\nYour case was extreme. You were the bad guy because you didn't give your son everything he asked for at all times.", "NTA your ex- wife wasn\u2019t trying to help your son she was trying to make him upset with you and his sister so he wouldn\u2019t notice her choosing her new children\u2019s financial security over his.", "You weren\u2019t an AH at all in original post. You tried to teach both kids equally. Your ex sounds ungrateful and unwilling to teach your son to be good with his money but rather than make financial mistakes and someone (you) will fix it. Good on you for what you\u2019ve been doing, food on him for growing and realizing his choices brought him to where he\u2019s at.", "I\u2019m curious. If you have as much money as you said to be able to send them to any college for the full time then why didn\u2019t you just put more money into their secured college funds? I understand wanting them to learn responsibility and be money wise. But I don\u2019t understand only saving enough for 2 years at a good college and expecting them to figure out the rest when you\u2019re perfectly capable of covering all of it. \nI still don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA but I\u2019m genuinely curious because I also have 3 kids and while we live comfortably I know we will not be able to pay for all 4 years of college for each of them, it\u2019s just not financially possible for us. But I so desperately wish we could! I would hate to start them off with student loan debt or make them get jobs instead of internships if I was capable of preventing that.", "It's posts like the original that always make me think twice about how I try to teach and guide my kiddo, because while I may not be in the same situation (the investment approach probably wouldn't have occurred to me to teach, at least not directly), the logic leading to the situation makes sense to me. Most of the decisions *feel* like ones I may have made, and I get worried.\n\nThen updates like this happen, where it turns out that the original situation wasn't nearly as unfair as feared, and there's a reasonable path forward, one that also feels like options I would have tried.\n\nSo glad it's working out for you and your kids, OP!", "YTA, you had two children gamble and are punishing one because the other got lucky. College isn't the time to \"teach responsibility,\" it's a decision with enormous consequence that will invariably alter the trajectory of both of their entire adult lives. You should, and could, have found some vastly less consequential way to teach this supposed lesson. Quit being a divorced dad stereotype and do your job.", "God's work", "  Ex being pissed is the cherry on top, but I am petty.", "I just went back and read the other post. I can\u2019t believe how many people were quick to say he was TA. He set clear expectations for each of them and they did things differently. \nNTA OP", "This is where I disagree. I needed to find a middle ground in which my daughter would feel comfortable with the extra help of her brother. If I just did something without consulting her, it would have been showing favoritism. So, in order to be fair, I did ask for her opinion on if she was comfortable with the opinions.\n\nThe reason he lives more with my ex does not have anything to do with my favoritism.\" There are a bunch of factors that lead to his decision. The context of this post is such a small piece of the total relationship between us all. In this aspect, it may be that I show a bit more \"favoritism\" towards my daughter. But there are plenty of other things that show \"favoritism\" towards my son.\n\nMy son and I relationship is really good on most if not all other aspects. Does he make dumb decisions? Yes, he, as so many people pointed out, is still a kid. My daughter does the same thing. But they learn from these decisions and mistakes. \n\nI'm not trying to make excuses. But there is a much bigger picture in the relationships between us all. I may seem like the AH for the way I said some things. But trying to keep things within the character count is hard. Also, while trying to be vague at the same time, it might not have allowed me to convey the information in a neutral way as possible. \n\nExamples are the way I describe my kids and how my daughter doesn't put on much makeup. Those were two generalized ways to describe them where most people would get the idea while not spending a bunch of time describing them. With the makeup, I see my mistake. But it comes down to how expensive that stuff is. I still stand by that it is priced ridiculously and the industry thrives on making women feel they are not enough without it.my ex and I tried to teach our daughter that she is beautiful both inside and out without makeup.", "He was voted TA when people thought he had his kids spending their college funds when they were young and then admonishing his young son for wasting that money and never giving him a chance to make it right again. But that was just a miscommunication.", "Oh yeah thats seems alittle bit too early", "Just my advice here, any extra money that you will give your son, give the same amount to your daughter too. Or else be ready ro face resentment in the future.", "It was, but I never pushed them it started out as \"Daddy, what are you doing?\" I showed them they seemed interested.

I asked for her opinion on how she feels about it all. And she thought the options were fair in her eyes (I did not just ask for only her opinion in this) and made it clear that what I do for my son I will do for my daughter.", "Well it doesnt seems fair that you let a little kid play with bug chunk of money and then punish him years after because he lost the money\n\nBut you do you", "So.. she is getting the money right?", "It wasn't a one-off thing, it was their allowance. Brother got burned on a risky investment and decided not to do any more investing, but also didn't start saving as he got older.", "He didn\u2019t? It was the kids weekly allowance.

The other part was that after the divorce, I had put about 90%of the money in the accounts. When we first opened them, we were supposed to keep putting in a % of our monthly earnings. But she stopped doing that during the divorce and didn't add any more to it. So yes, it was underfunded.

It took a while to get to where I am. I'm still learning.  I don't feel comfortable teaching other people because I don't want to be responsible for bad results. Just know that mistake happen.
