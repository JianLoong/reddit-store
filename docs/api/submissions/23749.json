{"id": 23749, "submission_id": "15gkyqz", "title": "AITA for not cancelling a boys trip upon my wife\u2019s request?", "selftext": "So here is the backstory. Me (33m) and my wife (32f) have a 1 year old son. Back when he was 5 months old, my friends and I began planning an annual golf trip, that would take place 6 months later. As soon as we had tentative dates and location, I asked my wife if it was okay to go. She gave me approval and I began to plan. I found an Airbnb and booked flights.\n\nFast forward to 5 months later, a couple of weeks before the trip. Our son was in the midst of a sleep regression and he was waking up several times each night. My wife still breastfed him and he would not accept me when he\u2019d wake up upset. As a result, she was left doing all of the tending to him during the nights.\n\nOne day she approached me and said she didn\u2019t want me to go anymore and that I needed to stay home because she was afraid it would be too much for her alone. I told her that I understood why she was anxious about it but she had agreed to me going already, and Id committed about $1k plus had the Airbnb in my name for all 12 of us.\n\nThis evolved into an argument and she was very mad that I would not change my mind. I told her that I\u2019d gladly return the favor on a trip if she wanted to plan one, and encouraged her to do so. During my trip, she sent me texts and called me, very upset. When I returned home we had another argument about it. We\u2019ve since reconciled but I know her stance on it has not changed, nor has mine.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve been asked to comment on length of trip and if I coordinated help for her before I left.\n\nI did coordinate help but she wasn\u2019t comfortable with someone else watching him at that point. The trip was 2 days, 3 nights.", "created_utc": 1691012768, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gkyqz/aita_for_not_cancelling_a_boys_trip_upon_my_wifes/", "score": 1500, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Updated based on the edit. I know it can be hard to trust anyone with a baby, but I feel like having a friend, family member or well-vetted babysitter come to help out for a few hours each day he was gone so she could take a nap was the most reasonable option, as this was a long planned trip where money would be lost if they canceled.", "Could no one come stay with her?  I feel like there\u2019s a middle ground option", "NTA\nDoes she not have family nearby? Do you not have family nearby? Did you take all of the other people she knows on the trip with you? She had plenty of notice to even arrange an out of town visit for help at the point where your kid started his sleep regression. Wasting that amount of money is insane to me and seeing the number of Y T A votes in this thread is staggering. I'm a mom and I flat out sent her father on a trip while she was in a sleep regression because having him around being effectively useless since she only wanted me made everything approximately 100x harder emotionally and mentally.\n\n\nEDIT: WOAH top comment! Thanks a bunch!", "NTA, situation is unfortunate but single parents manage to survive without a partner all the time, one week is not end of the world. People seem to be forgetting that here.", "NTA.

While it would have been better if you could have stayed home, he already had a grand+ committed, so it would be better to make good use of it. You also returned the favor via a trip for her, and seem to be doing more to take care of your kid judging by your comments. Also people in the comments are complaining about the baby often being left to your wife, but the baby refuses your care. For next time, don't make these kind of commitments 6 months in advance, or else problems will for sure come up.", "NTA. And honestly I don\u2019t understand all these people on Reddit that can\u2019t handle taking care of a kid by themselves. I know this comment will cause me to have downvotes but it\u2019s okay.

But when you get back make sure you take the baby for a couple of days.", "NTA. Especially after seeing your comment that your wife got to go on a trip for four days. Yet, you're not allowed to? That's called a double standard any way you look at it.", "NTA. It was 3 days. Not weeks, not months. You tried to get her help and she refused. She also agreed before hand. No offense, single parents do it all the time. 3 days is no big deal. All the Y T A\u2019s make me wonder how some people make it through the day. Goodness forbid doing something on one\u2019s own!\n\nOP, make sure you give your wife some time with her friends when she\u2019s ready.

As a mom of three I have spent years tied down breastfeeding and tending to one infant after another while my husband traveled for work at least half the month. The wife in this story has taken vacation from their ONE child, but somehow when it's the father's turn he's an asshole for wanting to go?

Since she was a month old, I was handling things on my own. He didn't want to leave to go back to work, but we needed him to.

That\u2019s on her. \n\nHe booked the AirBnB in his name. The guys cannot check in (at least that is policy) without him.", "I struggle with this. I had to go back to work after 3 months with my 2nd and that was a c-section. My husband traveled fairly often.  Sometimes, we don\u2019t have backups and have to do it on our own. The baby was going to be a year old. Maybe I\u2019m harsh, but I would expect a mother to handle an almost one year old by herself for a week. Especially if she isn\u2019t working.", "NTA your wife is silly and wanted to control you.", "Unpopular opinion but NTA \n\nYou gave your wife at least six months notice about this trip AND everything was in your name. You would have been screwing over an entire group of people had you not gone at that point. I think for this trip, you had to stick it out unless it was an emergency with the money you invested and how you did the reservations. Not to mention I do believe trips like this are critical for maintaining friend groups as we get older and have less available free time. \n\nYou also coordinated help, which some are going to say doesn't matter but I absolutely believe that matters as long as it's someone your wife is at least familiar with. \n\nIn the future though, I'd suggest not booking stuff in your name for the group if you're one of the few guys with a kid. This way it can be easier to back out without pissing off the rest of the group if something does come up. \n\nAlso, this trip was only three days. Your wife can survive a couple of nights on her own, people do it all of the time for other reasons. New mothers tend to be very anxious about things for good reasons. Sometimes it takes insisting that you get some time away to get over that hump.", "Are yall for real?  That's a single weekend trip. There are THOUSANDS of parents out there raising kids entirely by themselves and she can't handle ONE WEEKEND by herself with 6 MONTHS of time to prepare.\n\n\nThe followers on this page are ridiculous.

NTA your wife needs to be stronger and more capable.", "INFO your son is now a year old, have you planned another one?\n\nAdditional INFO have you put any effort into your wife getting time away?

You need to be a full time hype man on this, if you're not already.", "NTA - I was a mom with very similar circumstances, no family nearby, and a full time job. My husband had an opportunity to do a trip with friends that I literally FORCED him to go on. He promised to reciprocate - and followed through. I was absolutely overwhelmed, and it sort of sucked at the time, but come ON. 3 night and 2 days??? That\u2019s IT??? She acted like you were leaving on an impromptu two week cruise. Even without your edit, I had assumed you tried to arrange help and her turning that down is not on you. Nope. NTA. Nope nope nope.

She could have accepted the help from someone else that you arranged. She has an opportunity to get a break as well. Asking you to waste $1k because she didn\u2019t want to be the only one taking care of her own child for 3 days is ridiculous and foolish. \n\nAlso having such a long standing plan to go, with other people counting on you, she is out of line to expect you to be willing to cancel. \n\nShe probably just had anxiety about it, and so she should have allowed someone else to help, not demanded that it had to be you to stay and ease her anxiety.", "NTA considering you had arranged help for her, and it already discussed it and agreed to it and shelled out all the money, I think it was too much for her to ask you not to go, especially given how short the trip was. This would\u2019ve been an excellent opportunity for her to have a family member or friend come stay with her, or go visit her parents, or something like that so she had other people around her.", "I\u2019ve been a single mom for my son\u2019s entire life (I split with his father early in my pregnancy because of abuse). I took care of him by myself all the time. He\u2019s now in his 30\u2019s and married with children.\n\nWhen he napped, I napped. When he was awake and not eating, he had tummy time or in a bouncy seat so I could clean, do dishes, do laundry, etc. \n\nYour wife had ample time to find help, to accept the help you arranged, to handle things on her own without complaining. Her complaints seem grounded in not being able to control you. \n\nYou discussed this trip with your wife prior to making plans. She agreed to said plans. She had to know you spent money (for lodging, travel, etc). She knew 11 other people were counting on you to go. She knew some of the arrangements were in your name. Deciding last minute (very close to departure date) that she didn\u2019t want you to go was unreasonable.\n\nThis would be a completely different situation if your son had become seriously ill, but his sleep schedule reverting (a very normal occurrence) is not reason to abandon your trip. What were you supposed to do by staying home? It\u2019s not like you can nurse your son, nor does he want you for comfort at this time. \n\nI am baffled by all the YTA judgments. You are NTA. I am hoping that your wife\u2019s attitude is due to lack of sleep and that she will let this go, and that she takes you up on your offer to go on a girls trip when your son is weaned.\n\nEdit: adding age info on my son", "NTA. I\u2019m a mom of five and yeah it sucks to handle things on your own, but you compromised and promised her a trip of her own. I feel like that\u2019s perfectly reasonable. Baby is almost a year old so it\u2019s not like your leaving her freshly postpartum and healing.", "Mom of twin boys here\u2026NTA. You got permission to go ahead and plan. Your wife is also an adult and can be more helpful in solutioning for help while you\u2019re gone. IDK, I\u2019m kinda tired of this helpless-mom thing. I had nightmare regression periods with my kids, but I also kept my word when I told my husband that he could take time away.

Me (33m) and my wife (32f) have a 1 year old son. Back when he was 5 months old, my friends and I began planning an annual golf trip, that would take place 6 months later. As soon as we had tentative dates and location, I asked my wife if it was okay to go. She gave me approval and I began to plan. I found an Airbnb and booked flights.\n\nFast forward to 5 months later, a couple of weeks before the trip. Our son was in the midst of a sleep regression and he was waking up several times each night. My wife still breastfed him and he would not accept me when he\u2019d wake up upset. As a result, she was left doing all of the tending to him during the nights.\n\nOne day she approached me and said she didn\u2019t want me to go anymore and that I needed to stay home because she was afraid it would be too much for her alone. I told her that I understood why she was anxious about it but she had agreed to me going already, and Id committed about $1k plus had the Airbnb in my name for all 12 of us.\n\nThis evolved into an argument and she was very mad that I would not change my mind. I told her that I\u2019d gladly return the favor on a trip if she wanted to plan one, and encouraged her to do so. During my trip, she sent me texts and called me, very upset. When I returned home we had another argument about it. We\u2019ve since reconciled but I know her stance on it has not changed, nor has mine.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "You were the asshole in that situation because during the time she gave you approval the child was not up all night but when it started occurring  she told you she could not handle this by herself. And you decide to go on trip with people instead of staying back and help with your child when she was struggling. It does not matter that you made a commitment because you ask made a commitment to your wife and child. What you should have done was trying to reschedule for another time or let your friends go.  When you become a parent you lose some freedoms you had in the past. You knew that when you had the child. Also let me ask you did your wife go when your child was still not sleeping through the night or did she wait until he could.\n\nEdit \nYTA", "Did you hire someone to help those days you were gone?  I think it's fine that you got away for some golf and fun and downtime, but it sounds like it should have been handled better.

You got to go play while she was left sleepless and with all the responsibility of child rearing.  \n\nYTA for not realizing that your wife needs help.", "YTA. I'm sorry but with kids plans change last minute all the time, that's the reality. What your wife was communicating to you was that she needed your help. It wasn't something she couldn't foresee.

She isn\u2019t either, but it\u2019s literally three days, barely. I\u2019m not saying she should suck it up but there was more than enough time to plan a grandma situation, assuming you guys are close with parents or still have them around. Is it just you guys with no one to help you out?", "NTA- yes sleep regressions are hard and I\u2019m sure your wife is exhausted. But you\u2019ve been planning this trip for months and spent a lot of money on it. Then she wanted you to cancel last minute and waste that money? I have three kids of my own so I understand lack of sleep is draining, but I feel her expectations were unreasonable. Like others have mentioned, could she not have arranged to have family or friends help out for a couple of days?", "NTA. You asked her, she said yes - there's nothing to discuss. You even offered to do the same thing so she can go on a trip. If she has still issues after all of this, it's not your fault.", "NTA.  Too late now because the trip is over, but offering to find her some help would have been nice.

I stayed home and worked from home. I took care of the kids at night because my spouse worked during the day. I would have no problem with a 3 day trip, even a 1 week trip.

You should have known that all kinds of sleep problems can pop up, and when a wife who is struggling asks for help, she has usually pushed her limits as far as she can go and is hitting crisis levels.

You could have even done things like cleaned the house or hired a housekeeper if she wasn't comfortable with a random babysitter watching her child.

Is he less entitled to a break than I am?", "You know it\u2019s so funny I don\u2019t think these people have kids my kid naps for 3 hours during the day and is in bed by 8:30 and doesn\u2019t wake up till 8am the next morning. He\u2019s 1 years old and plays on his own watches his shows and plays with his toys. I remember the first 9 months sucked but this kid is 1", "So he\u2019s NTA, but they specifically said the kid had a sleep regression- aka NOT napping or sleeping on a schedule.  Everyone keeps saying kids nap for hours as if it applies in this situation when the kid not sleeping was the whole issue.", "Some babies nap constantly. Some do not. You also appear to have missed the sleep regression part. There is probably some information being left out. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous to say someone shouldn\u2019t be a parent because they want their partner around.", "Their baby is 1. One year olds very much do not nap constantly. My one year old take one nap per day (at most)", "\n\n>Babies nap constantly.\n\nthat is not a universal fact.", "Lol not all babies are the same?? Mine was always resistant to napping, even as a newborn.\n\nCongrats on having easy babies and great executive functioning.", "Newborns nap constantly. A 1 year old is probably taking 1, at most 2 naps a day. I still think he\u2019s NTA, because she had plenty of time to plan for help if she needed it. But saying babies nap constantly is just not true.", "Damn, I ordered the wrong models. \n\nMy babies most assuredly did not nap all the time. \n\nYour experience is not everyone's experience.", "You're not the wife in question, so what you can do doesn't count for shit.", "and then hassled him while he was on the trip, and kept going on about it when he got back.", "I saw that one!! Crazy judgment imo\ud83e\udee0", "Yeah, I was a single mom, and my family was 1500 miles away...good grief, it's not that big a deal.", "Because they\u2019re implicitly rewriting the entire history of the relationship in their heads. This is that ex, yes, *that* ex, who wanted to go out with his buddies when he hadn\u2019t done any housework for the last 7 years. \n\nOP? His wife? Who? The only context the responder needs for a relationship post is the dynamics of *their own* relationship. Good, bad, man, woman, doesn\u2019t matter. All the commenters are like that.", ">My son didn't sleep thru the night till he was 2. I worked full-time and got up with him most of the time. I guess I got used to it.\n\nI am in the thick of this right now and I feel you. Our third didn't sleep through the night consistently until he was 2, though thankfully he'd accept his dad more in the second year (he'd actually settle down better for my husband for the most part, lol). Our fourth is 9 months and on track to be the same at this rate. \n\nI'm dragging ass more days than I'm not, but I know this kid will sleep eventually, and in the mean time all I can do is keep on keepin' on.", "She shouldn\u2019t have had to though.", "genuine question, as I often wonder what the driving force is for women in a similar situation to you - why did you continue to have kids with this specific man after you saw he wasn't going to help? was it just because you preferred to be a single parent but just get the kids out in a quicker period of time (Vs if you had to wait until you found a new partner you liked)? Or was it just denial at the time?  \nAgain, I just genuinely wonder at the motivations/thought process, I'm not being passive aggressive and trying to judge! Obviously you can choose to ignore my comment, you owe nothing to my curiosity! :)", "Ooof my mom was in a similar situation, she had 3 under 3 (1 + twins) my dad was so bad she was practically a single parent and they split when my brother was 4 and my sis and I were 2\u2026.she handled it because she had to but she also had help from my grandparents. Sure its an inconvenient time for OPs LO to regress, but he planned months in advance, it wasn\u2019t an emergency, and most importantly he tried to arrange help for her (she technically could have done that herself but she was tired) and she refused the help. OP NTA", "A year later isn\u2019t literally postpartum.", "I mean, to be fair nobody can properly function on 4 hours of sleep but when you have no choice you just sorta deal until you can get a break. My oldest had great sleep by 4 months. My 2nd one was an absolute nightmare sleeper until he was 2 getting up many times a night. Now, he only gets up 2 or 3 times but with screaming night terrors. Wife has had to travel for work or pleasure many times over the years leaving me alone and you just kinda sorta suck it up on your own till they come back?", "Exactly! My husband deployed when my son was 4 months old and my oldest was 2. For that entire year I don't think he ever slept more than 3 hours straight at night and he only napped in a moving stroller or shopping cart. Those weren't even the periods of sleep regression and I survived on my own with no family around.", "He edited original post to say that after being asked/ challenged - so as I commented in a reply to someone else yes, if true, might alter things. I commented on the original post & following comment.", "You\u2019re absolutely right about that. But at the very least, he could prep food, order food deliveries, or hire help with either the baby or the house. I also recognize not everyone can afford that, but I imagine someone who spends $1k on a golf trip could budget for this. But also, a compromise could be made where her only job is to take care of the baby while he\u2019s gone and he takes care of the chores that piled up on his return.", "Oh come on! A sleep regression and she\u2019s breastfeeding?? There\u2019s nothing he can do anyway. I\u2019ve done it several times. All the husband can do is make supportive noises. If anyone pulled a crap move it was the wife.", "Agreed, she has to learn to plan for times when her husband isn't there", "Or it\u2019s two people trying to sort out where they stand now. And again, this is only his side of things.", "She needed HIM. Her husband.\n\nWhen my partner says they are deeply struggling, and need ME, no one else but ME, your damn straight I\u2019ll drop EVERYTHING for them.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a clingy moment of jealousy, or some inconsequential request.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of something happening if I\u2019m left alone with my baby\u201d. THAT statement should make any good partner drop everything and show up. It\u2019s a yearly trip, skip a year.", "My kid is 8 months so not quite 1 but getting there. My baby sleeps in tiny chunks and is a little terror that is into everything. I don\u2019t think OP is NTA but I\u2019d definitely struggle without my husband. I don\u2019t think either of us would force the other to go solo at this point unless it was something super unavoidable (important work trip, funeral, etc)", "Do you as a parent seriously think that every one year old is like yours?", "Exactly.\n\n1 year olds sleep something like 12-14 hours a day. I understand it's not all at once. I'm not saying it's super easy, especially in this specific situation. I'd never even think to ask my wife to skip a planned and nonrefundable trip with friends for something like this. I'd suck it up as she'd deserve it and I know she'd do the same for me with no qualms. \n\nBut the idea that there's just zero time to get any sleep for 3 days is quite the reach.", "The kid not sleeping was ONE issue. The nonrefundable $1,000 was another issue.", "Wanting and needing are two different things. She shouldn\u2019t NEED her partner, just like if the baby didn\u2019t breastfeed, he shouldn\u2019t NEED her. You should be able to function if your spouse is gone for a couple days", "Well even easier then, one year olds can entertain themselves to a degree, and don\u2019t need to be held constantly, and should still nap for at least a couple hours.", "But you don\u2019t really know her side of the story. Just his and he\u2019s presenting himself in the best possible light. She\u2019s just a shadowy character in his internal drama.", "They have to sleep sometime.", "How's your kid in a carrier or sling? My kiddo preferred being held when sleeping, and a sling gave me hands-free time.", "My youngest of 3 kids mostly napped in baby carriers. Daytime naps were not good but he slept better at night typically. \n\nFor my other two kids who did nap I always did sidelying breastfeeding to get them all to sleep and rolled away. Their sleep cycles are like 45 mins at that point though so that's usually all I got.", "I was 14 and had my 5 month old brother strapped to my chest while cleaning and in his swing or play pen when I needed to cook or shower, and he always wanted to be held. My mom worked 20 hour days, and not once did she come home to a dirty house and hungry kids. She didn't have to wake up and get us ready for school because I did that. She may have worked, but I had a good 2\u00bd years of me raising my siblings (10, 4, and 5mo) and maintaining the house practically on my own. I don't know your situation but it's possible.\n\nEDIT: grammar", "People have pointed out the baby is one, and yes, that means less naps, but it should also mean you can get more done when the baby is awake, a one year old can play.", "Are you under the impression I have special powers? Any parent worth a shit should be able to handle their own kid.", "Interesting, I keep seeing the votes as split! I hope you\u2019re right, though. I\u2019d love for this double standard to dwindle into nothing.", "So ridiculous. I was also a young single working mom and took care of my son when he was a baby all on my own.", "My mom had me with my shit dad knowing she'd be done with him soon. She wanted more kids and didn't want multiple fathers. I was her #3 and she genuinely wanted 5+ but knew it wasn't in the cards. So she had the 1 more she could and left him when I was 6mos.", "This sounds true in your head but in practice with kids it really isn't. Babies get accustomed to what they know. You can't even change a BRAND of formula if they've gotten used to another without significant pain points and once you DO switch you can't just go back. And swapping a breastfed baby to formula for 2 or 3 days and back again after is absolutely a nonstarter.

The wife agreed to the trip, their AriBnB is in HIS name, and it's a two day trip.\n\nHow in any sense would he be the asshole for not wholesale canceling the trip when there are loads of other options the wife can use for assistance with ONE kid.\n\nThis is weird controlling behaviour from the wife.", "I kept a 3 yr old and a 7 month old for 5 days because my wife went on a trip.  I traveled some for work so she wanted some time for herself, I said have at it.  We will be here when you get back.  Was it easy?  Hell no, but she deserved a break after I was gone all week for 4 weeks in a row (home on weekends).", "Yeah, literally why I said he was NTA.\n\nEdit- actually the non refundable was why he still went, but it wasn\u2019t THE issue. The issue was the kid not sleeping and the already overwhelmed and sleep deprived mother panicking because she didn\u2019t think she could do it alone for 3 days.  \nThe reason she was panicking is because the kids not sleeping- so the argument that she is a horrible parent because \u201ckids that age sleep all the time\u201d is stupid af\n\nThe reason he is NTA is because it was a non refundable deposit.", "Wanting and needing a PlayStation are two different things. Wanting your partner around while you\u2019re caring for a child is very reasonable.

It was all boob all the time. \n\nI coped. We all do when presented with challenges of this nature. And evidently so did she. So.....is she mad that she was ok for that time so she can't hold it over his head I wonder? Or is she proud she held it together?
