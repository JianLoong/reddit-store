Kim offered to host the party at her house and make the food for it, the rest of us would just show up right after getting off work to decorate and set-up. Kim is vegan which is fine and dandy, the only problem is I have a soy allergy. Kim knows about this. I never expect her to go out of her way to alter what she makes for my sake, there's just an agreement between us that it's not very often I can eat what she makes because she uses a lot of soy-based condiments and substitutes. However, since this was a party taking place after work and was supposed to last awhile, I asked Kim if she could hold off on certain legumes and the like in at least one thing she makes so I could eat while at the party. She said she would try.\n\nFor my part, I packed myself an extra lunch to keep in a cooler throughout the day. It didn't consist of any meat but there were eggs and items made with mayo or yogurt. I intended to eat it before the party started while decorating but I wasn't hungry at that point. Once the party started I did munch on some cut-up vegetables but they weren't cutting it and I got really hungry. Kim had made two things of mashed potatoes but she couldn't remember which bowl had been made with soy milk and which had been made with almond milk. I went out to my car and brought my pack inside so I could eat something. Kim came over to me and said she could smell the mayo and told me to eat in my car, that she was fine that I wasn't eating what she had made but I knew she has a vegan household and doesn't allow non-vegan foods in. Mind you, it's January, nighttime, and cold as hell outside. I wasn't going to argue with her because it was her house and didn't want to ruin the party by addressing the issue right there, but I also didn't want to have to speed eat while sitting in my car or make frequent trips outside just to snack, so I said good-bye to our friend who's birthday it was and left.\n\nA couple hours later I started getting a bunch of texts asking why I had left so early in the night. I said it was because I was hungry, but some of our friends kept pushing because they had seen me come inside with my pack after saying I was grabbing food so I was honest with them that it was because Kim told me to go eat in my car. Some of our friends are split now and think Kim should've been willing to be flexible since it was at night and really cold outside, and others are siding with her. Kim is just mad and thinks I started drama on purpose. \n\nAITA for leaving after she told me to eat in my car?", "created_utc": 1674923867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nj9bz/aita_for_leaving_a_birthday_party_because_i/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand not wanting non vegan foods in her home, but Kim isn\u2019t a good host or a good friend. You remained tactful and tried to save face for Kim, but she shot herself in the foot by brushing you off without a second thought.", "NTA. Your friend sucks. Like, this is beyond messed up. She wanted you to starve or go eat in a cold car just so she didn\u2019t have to put in some extra work and I\u2019m willing to bet she doesn\u2019t believe you actually have a soy allergy. You brought your own food! You did everything to try and accommodate and honestly you eating a little bit of mayo should not mess with her. How does she function in life if she\u2019s going to be this strict with what other people eat??", "NTA her diet is a choice.  Your alternative meal was a necessity.  If it was that important to her she would have made sure you could eat something other then crudit\u00e9s", "NTA but your friend really needs to do some research on being a good host.", "NTA. Kim is not a very gracious host, and your friends don't need to take sides. Keep it between the two of you.", "NTA - she knows you have a soy allergy and she made one thing you could eat, if you were okay with the 50% odds of ending up eating the allergen containing option. Then, instead of feeling bad for her mistake that left you without anything to eat, she told you to go eat your own food in your car. She was hell of rude and the type to give vegans a bad reputation.", "NTA. It's not that hard to make vegan food without soy, and any good host would have made sure there was some stuff you could eat.", "NTA. You did the right thing by bringing your own food. And leaving when you did was a reasonable boundary. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re the one causing the drama in this situation.", "NTA. Kim is a poor hostess. She didn't have food you could eat, didn't even try to ensure she  knew what  potatoes were free from soy. Vegans shouldn't throw parties at home if they have\" strict vegan\" households. That's really immature to ignore a guests food allergy and force them to eat in a dark , cold car.  She's the problem and she has bad manners.", "NTA. Kim was incredibly inconsiderate here in several ways: only having mashed potatoes for you in the first place, not paying enough attention to keep track of the one thing you could eat, and placing her dietary choice over your allergy and asking you to eat outside, even though the only reason you were eating your food in her house was because of her fuck up. The entire situation is on her. She does not sound like a good friend, a good host, or a good person.", "NTA\n\nEating inside was not contaminating any of her food or items in the home.", "NTA. Kim's a terrible hostess. All she offered you were mashed potatoes and raw vegetables? That's bull. And why didn't she make completely vegan soy-free mashed potatoes? I make them with olive oil and garlic broth (plus more garlic and fresh herbs).", "NTA-I would have done the same thing here. A host should never ask a guest to eat outside, alone in the cold.", "NTA why this has to be some sort of group drama is beyond me. She didn\u2019t want the food in the house and you didn\u2019t want to eat in freezing weather. No need for any drama here.", "It is super weird that someone who must have to ask for a lot of accommodations for their food preferences was so inconsiderate when you asked her to accommodate yours. It is also weird that she wouldn\u2019t even let you eat your food in the house. It\u2019s not like you were prepping it on her counter. You are NTA for leaving. Imagine if the same thing would have happened in reverse to her. Would she have stayed?", "NTA\n\nI am vegan and although I don\u2019t like non vegan items in the house (my partner will buy some non vegan snacks that he keeps in his office and I don\u2019t mind that.) my main this is I don\u2019t want meat to be cooked because that smell tends to linger. I would have 0 issue with someone eating a sandwich they made in advance. Yeah the smell might linger a little, but with a party I would be cleaning the house the next day anyway. I bring vegan snacks and food if I know I\u2019m going somewhere I probably won\u2019t have options at. She should be understanding of that - it\u2019s the universal experience of vegans to bring a granola bar or pb&j to a party or wedding when you have no idea if there will be options for you. \n\nYou did the right thing. She was being dramatic. If she was allergic to eggs that would be a different story. I\u2019m sorry she didn\u2019t care enough to label the food you could eat (why on earth would she have to make 2 types of mashed potatoes. Just do the one with almond milk. It\u2019ll taste the same)", "NTA.  Kim is vegan by choice (and privilege), but OP has dietary concerns by necessity.  It was an AH move to make OP eat in their car and I don't blame them for just leaving and being made to feel that unwelcome.\n\nInfo: How often does Kim expect to have her vegan restrictions accomodated?", "NTA and I really want to understand who is raising these people. I get that it's her home, her rules, but if you're going to invite guests to your home, you should at least make a slight effort to be a good host. And that includes accommodating food allergies. If you are unwilling to provide food that meets your guests' needs, then you should be okay with them bringing their own food. And if you aren't? Then why are you hosting a freaking social event in the first place? \n\ntl;dr: Kim isn't your friend. And people siding with her clearly don't understand the risks of food allergies.", "Kim is not your friend.  She is an entitled, ablest brat who thinks her preferences are more important than your medical disability.  Cut her off and anyone who thinks she's in the right, because you're at very high risk of being intentionally poisoned the next time you see these people.  Maybe they're not psychos, but I certainly would never trust anyone who thinks this isn't a big deal to not try to \"teach you a lesson.\"  Kim already tried to feed you unsafe food.\n\nAlso, soy allergies suuuuuuuuuuck, I'm sorry.  That shit is in everything.", "NTA. This is a bit ridiculous imo. And I am a vegan. I assume she can be in the workplace and see people eating meat and dairy? Did she also stop anyone from entering who had leather in their shoes or perhaps a leather patch on their jeans or beeswax in their mascara?\n\nAs a hostess she can have requests of her guests but at the point that you choose to host you\u2019re relinquishing some control. Her home will never be fully vegan as long as she\u2019s inviting guests over.", "NTA - you have an allergy and she forgot? which dish had soy in it. What? In what world is that okay? If she can't make safe food for you to eat she needs to let you bring your own food. Send her out to the car every time she comes over to eat at your place. Your house is now non-vegan. Or better yet next time you cook her something, make two, one cooked fat and one with oil, and lets see if she eats it!", "NTA, and ain't it funny how there are entire cultures that practice part-time veganism and somehow manage not to include any soy?\n\nCome on over to my place and I'll fix you my kickass vegan chili and a stack of tortillas.  Or my black-eyed peas delicious and a pot of rice.  Or my raise-the-dead split pea soup (so called because when you feel like death and nothing is appealing you can still enjoy it) and whole wheat bread.  I am happily omnivorous and I got this figured out...what's her excuse?", "NTA.\n\nVegan household... Please...", "NTA. this kind of shit is why people hate vegans. they're ALL self-righteous assholes.", "NTA.", "NTA. Kim is the reason people do not like vegans.", "NTA I\u2019m a vegan and Kim is being ridiculous. Vegans like this are genuinely the minority and piss me the fuck off cuz they make the rest of us look so bad.\n\nYou didn\u2019t ask to come into her house and cook up some bacon you brought. She didn\u2019t make sure the food was safe for you to eat! She should know you either needed to your food eat inside or leave. Eating in the car is so unreasonable.\n\nMy friends LOVE my vegan food, but I\u2019d also never be upset if they wanted to bring their own food. And as long as it\u2019s not meat with a really strong smell (like bacon has) they can even cook up their meat at my place as long as they don\u2019t expect me to do it and thoroughly clean.\n\nShe essentially kicked you out for having mayo and that\u2019s honestly dumb as fuck if she\u2019s gonna also complain if you choose to leave because of it.", "NTA. I\u2019d have done the same thing. If she can\u2019t be bothered to remember which mashed potato has the soy milk then she should let you eat your own food in her house. I hope you smeared mayo on everything you passed on your way out.", "NTA i have soy intolerance and i will not risk it. thankfully my ppl have been so understanding and will check packaging and remember which dishes have things i can\u2019t eat, because that\u2019s just what you do when you care about someone. also, its not starting drama if someone asks a question and you answer honestly.", "You're NTA. Kim's rude and self righteous attitude on top of her inability to be able to tell you which of the mashed potatoes would not make you seriously ill left you with no choice but to leave.", "NTA. \n\n>Kim came over to me and said she could smell the mayo\n\nHer life must be miserable if she is offended by the smell of mayo. I would never step across her threshold again.", "NTA, how did you start a drama by giving an answer? If she thinks her actions better shouldn't be known than she shouldn't do them.", "NTA - it\u2019s 100% possible to make vegan food without soy, Kim made it so you couldn\u2019t eat. The one starting drama is not the person who decided to leave when the host made it clear they weren\u2019t welcome.", "NTA.\n\nKim has been on the receiving end of this behavior enough times that it's truly an AH move to turn around and do it to someone else. And why in the world would she make mashed potatoes with soy milk and mashed potatoes with almond milk? Just make them all with almond milk! Or put a little turmeric or chives in one so it looks different! This isn't even that hard, ffs.\n\nOf course, she should know better than to offer up mashed potatoes and raw veggies as the only options for someone, because she's been on the receiving end of \"a side dish and some raw veggies is enough food for dinner, right?\". This is really lazy and a complete lack of empathy from someone who should know better.\n\nYou're not an asshole for leaving because your host failed to make you feel welcome. I understand Kim's morals and stance about not allowing non-vegan foods in her house, but if she can't make some simple changes to her recipes to accommodate her guests (it can be soy free and vegan!), she shouldn't be hosting in the first place.", "Why to some people accommodating to others in these circumstances is so burdensome? \n\nI have a friend that can\u2019t eat gluten and it wasn\u2019t a problem at all making sure there was something she could eat at my birthday dinner. Didn\u2019t kill me. I was glad she could eat like everyone else. NTA.", "My daughter came home for Christmas, she is lactose intolerant. Many people don't know because she doesn't make a big deal about it. \n\nI asked everyone to consider her when picking out food.... Don't feel like you can't bring anything with dairy. But if you're picking out biscuits and there's a choice between ones with dairy and ones without. Pick the without. \n\nEVERYONE made an effort and she had so many choices. It was just so lovely. She's used to going to parties and not being able to eat hardly anything. I was so grateful that everyone cared and made that extra effort. \n\nBut you know what... That's how people who care about you treat you. \n\nIf I were you, I would never go out of my way to make sure there's a vegan dish for her. I just don't have friends who don't care about me. So she would go from friend to acquaintance that very night. And I would have no problem letting everyone know why.", "NTA", "NAH- You left because you were hungry and couldn't eat any of the food being served. It's quite that simple.

If she can't tell the difference between potatoes made with soy vs. almond milk by tasting them, she would have had to reason to make two separate batches.

Seriously mashed potatoes and diced up veggies is it? And couldn't remember which was safe? That was entirely passive aggressive on her part. Also if she has a smart phone, computer, etc her home is not vegan friendly. Same with a lot of other items she 100% uses in daily life.

Same flipping difference.", "NTA.\n\nYou clearly expressed your needs and asked for a well justified, easy to oblige accommodation from a host who volunteered herself in the first place. Then you went ahead and prepared a back up plan just in case.\n\nOn the other hand, Kim is a host. Therefore she has responsibilities to accommodate her guests to the best of her abilities. Also an allergy is an important point to consider and offering only some mashed potato that may or may not be harmful to you is at best distasteful and at worst malicious.\n\nOn top of that, her refusing to accommodate your back up plan is very unwelcoming and unfriendly and it being winter or night doesn't even matter under the circumstances she created in the first place that led you to opt for eating your own food.\n\n(and it's your relationships with these people so maybe it's not place to comment on that part, but if it were me, I'd start questioning the sincerity of those friends who don't find a problem with the way Kim treated you.)", "NTA.

That's disgusting, especially as you didn't even ask her to violate her vegan views, just to adjust the menu slightly. Aside from that, how does she expect an adult to subsist on JUST mashed potato?

But they have to be reasonable about it and absolutely must ensure that everyone has something that they can safely eat without a reaction. Kim is firmly TA in this case because she was aware of OP's soy allergy and didn't do shit to try and cater to it.

Bless them they even raised chickens and made homemade bread to avoid the soy in commercial products. Keep a detailed ongoing list of which seasoning and sauce brands can use. Which really sucks because I love Chinese food but got to make it at home.", "Now you're just making me hungry! Some of the best chilis I've had were vegetarian chilis.", "Lifetime vegetarian here, that shit is ridiculous lol. As if bringing in mayo/yogurt would somehow ruin her house or is triggering to her? Not sure which but people with these strict food rules want to live in a bubble and have everyone accommodate them when she wouldn\u2019t accommodate OP at all. It\u2019s not like OP came in with a juicy steak or tuna salad, and they thought ahead to even bring their own food because they knew they\u2019d be excluded! People like OPs friend are why vegans have a bad name", "Not so. I know many vegans who are friendly and good people, unlike Kim.", "Exactly. It's not hard to find a work around and everything the op brought was vegetarian. No meats. I'm not vegan or vegetarian anymore but I love veg and wouldn't dream of inviting people for a party without having foods for all my guests.", "But why should OP be forced to eat in their car in the first place? If I have to go and get in my car and turn it on for the heat, I'm going to put it in gear and drive myself home. Kim was bogus for what she did and OP did what was best for themselves. NTA", "That's not her friend, a friend doesn't send you off to eat in the car in the cold at night. NTA op.", "Agree, NTA\n\nOP I don't think Kim is actually your friend. One side dish that she couldn't even be bothered to label? \n\nYou were beyond accommodating to her lifestyle choice whole she couldn't be assed to consider your allergy", "Right? I would assume the entire reason there were two was because of OP\u2019s soy allergy. So why would not take extra careful care to know which is which? Can you imagine how she\u2019d react if someone didn\u2019t remember which mashed potatoes used dairy butter and which used non-dairy?", "There is a difference between being vegan and plant based. Someone who is vegan is anout animal ethics and will abstain from things like leather, products thag have been animal tested, etc in addition to a plant based diet as much as they can. Plant based is about just the foods. So yes for a vegan I could see having eggs in the house as going against their ethics. Not saying I agree but vegan is about more than just not eating animal by products.\n\nNow she is TA for not using soy in a couple dishes. There are so many ways to sub out soy. And this would result in less harm as then OP wouldn't have to eat eggs for this meal and maybe convince them that they actually can eat plant based.", "But she wants to only offer up mystery mashed potatoes and refuses to accommodate your allergies or allow you to eat the food you can eat in her home? I dunno. Your friend is a bad friend and I would need apologies and a show of actually attempting to accommodate before I\u2019d be willing to come by again.", "Then she is an even worse friend/host. If she KNOWS and believes you have an allergy she should have made more of an effort not just say she'd \"try\" which she in fact did NOT try even a little.", "Yeah, banishing him to the outside because of a little mayonnaise?? Kim doesn't have a strict vegan diet- she won't allow anything non vegan into her home. That's incredibly restrictive and a  good way to make sure no one wants to come over anymore.  Kim has some issues", "It reads as incredibly passive aggressive to me. It seems like she begrudgingly made one (side) item without soy, but was so annoyed about having to do it that she couldn't even be bothered to label it. She obviously wasn't trying very hard to accommodate OP. Plus, if she had truly felt bad about her mistake, she had other options to remedy the situation; the easiest one being to let up on her \"no vegan food in my home\" rule for a couple of hours so that OP could actually enjoy the party, too.", "Exactly, there is a concerning lack of empathy. How many posts have there been about someone that's vegan being assured that their diet can be accommodated only to be served a small bowl of undressed salad greens (because every dressing option has egg, dairy, or honey)?", "I already eat a lot of plant-based dishes, I am well aware it's possible. If she hadn't used teriyaki, soy milk, legumes, or soy-based cheeses, I could've eaten at least a few things she made.", "She's not your friend.", "Yea I don't even get the \"absolutely no non vegan items\" allowed thing. Like sure if you brought a huge piece of steak i could understand a vegan being mad about that. But mayo? Come on now", "i've never met one who wasn't obnoxious.", "[removed]", "Agreed", "Oh no I do agree she could've given some wiggle room and would like an apology. I'm only saying that she does know and believe I have an allergy, and since she knows it, just let me eat it in the house one time so I didn't freeze my chesticles off.", "Right? There was a built in option RIGHT THERE that wouldn\u2019t be a huge imposition! \n\nImma be honest now, I can\u2019t help but want an egg salad sandwich after all this. I might need to start boiling eggs.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It\u2019s really not that difficult and there are tons of options for vegan friendly and soy free options. \n\nI don\u2019t think Kim is actually your friend, I think she\u2019s using you. You helped set up the party and then she essentially found a way to kick you out and make you feel unwelcome.", "Yum! I hope you use extra mayo!", "It\u2019ll be delicious!", "Follow up: it WAS delicious."]}
