Kim offered to host the party at her house and make the food for it, the rest of us would just show up right after getting off work to decorate and set-up. Kim is vegan which is fine and dandy, the only problem is I have a soy allergy. Kim knows about this. I never expect her to go out of her way to alter what she makes for my sake, there's just an agreement between us that it's not very often I can eat what she makes because she uses a lot of soy-based condiments and substitutes. However, since this was a party taking place after work and was supposed to last awhile, I asked Kim if she could hold off on certain legumes and the like in at least one thing she makes so I could eat while at the party. She said she would try.\n\nFor my part, I packed myself an extra lunch to keep in a cooler throughout the day. It didn't consist of any meat but there were eggs and items made with mayo or yogurt. I intended to eat it before the party started while decorating but I wasn't hungry at that point. Once the party started I did munch on some cut-up vegetables but they weren't cutting it and I got really hungry. Kim had made two things of mashed potatoes but she couldn't remember which bowl had been made with soy milk and which had been made with almond milk. I went out to my car and brought my pack inside so I could eat something. Kim came over to me and said she could smell the mayo and told me to eat in my car, that she was fine that I wasn't eating what she had made but I knew she has a vegan household and doesn't allow non-vegan foods in. Mind you, it's January, nighttime, and cold as hell outside. I wasn't going to argue with her because it was her house and didn't want to ruin the party by addressing the issue right there, but I also didn't want to have to speed eat while sitting in my car or make frequent trips outside just to snack, so I said good-bye to our friend who's birthday it was and left.\n\nA couple hours later I started getting a bunch of texts asking why I had left so early in the night. I said it was because I was hungry, but some of our friends kept pushing because they had seen me come inside with my pack after saying I was grabbing food so I was honest with them that it was because Kim told me to go eat in my car. Some of our friends are split now and think Kim should've been willing to be flexible since it was at night and really cold outside, and others are siding with her. Kim is just mad and thinks I started drama on purpose. \n\nAITA for leaving after she told me to eat in my car?", "created_utc": 1674923867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nj9bz/aita_for_leaving_a_birthday_party_because_i/", "score": 4431, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand not wanting non vegan foods in her home, but Kim isn\u2019t a good host or a good friend. You remained tactful and tried to save face for Kim, but she shot herself in the foot by brushing you off without a second thought.", "NTA. Your friend sucks. Like, this is beyond messed up. She wanted you to starve or go eat in a cold car just so she didn\u2019t have to put in some extra work and I\u2019m willing to bet she doesn\u2019t believe you actually have a soy allergy. You brought your own food! You did everything to try and accommodate and honestly you eating a little bit of mayo should not mess with her. How does she function in life if she\u2019s going to be this strict with what other people eat??", "NTA her diet is a choice.  Your alternative meal was a necessity.  If it was that important to her she would have made sure you could eat something other then crudit\u00e9s", "NTA but your friend really needs to do some research on being a good host.", "NTA. Kim is not a very gracious host, and your friends don't need to take sides. Keep it between the two of you.", "NTA - she knows you have a soy allergy and she made one thing you could eat, if you were okay with the 50% odds of ending up eating the allergen containing option. Then, instead of feeling bad for her mistake that left you without anything to eat, she told you to go eat your own food in your car. She was hell of rude and the type to give vegans a bad reputation.", "NTA. It's not that hard to make vegan food without soy, and any good host would have made sure there was some stuff you could eat.", "NTA. You did the right thing by bringing your own food. And leaving when you did was a reasonable boundary. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re the one causing the drama in this situation.", "NTA. Kim is a poor hostess. She didn't have food you could eat, didn't even try to ensure she  knew what  potatoes were free from soy. Vegans shouldn't throw parties at home if they have\" strict vegan\" households. That's really immature to ignore a guests food allergy and force them to eat in a dark , cold car.  She's the problem and she has bad manners.", "NTA. Kim was incredibly inconsiderate here in several ways: only having mashed potatoes for you in the first place, not paying enough attention to keep track of the one thing you could eat, and placing her dietary choice over your allergy and asking you to eat outside, even though the only reason you were eating your food in her house was because of her fuck up. The entire situation is on her. She does not sound like a good friend, a good host, or a good person.", "NTA\n\nEating inside was not contaminating any of her food or items in the home.", "NTA. Kim's a terrible hostess. All she offered you were mashed potatoes and raw vegetables? That's bull. And why didn't she make completely vegan soy-free mashed potatoes? I make them with olive oil and garlic broth (plus more garlic and fresh herbs).", "NTA-I would have done the same thing here. A host should never ask a guest to eat outside, alone in the cold.", "NTA why this has to be some sort of group drama is beyond me. She didn\u2019t want the food in the house and you didn\u2019t want to eat in freezing weather. No need for any drama here.", "It is super weird that someone who must have to ask for a lot of accommodations for their food preferences was so inconsiderate when you asked her to accommodate yours. It is also weird that she wouldn\u2019t even let you eat your food in the house. It\u2019s not like you were prepping it on her counter. You are NTA for leaving. Imagine if the same thing would have happened in reverse to her. Would she have stayed?", "NTA\n\nI am vegan and although I don\u2019t like non vegan items in the house (my partner will buy some non vegan snacks that he keeps in his office and I don\u2019t mind that.) my main this is I don\u2019t want meat to be cooked because that smell tends to linger. I would have 0 issue with someone eating a sandwich they made in advance. Yeah the smell might linger a little, but with a party I would be cleaning the house the next day anyway. I bring vegan snacks and food if I know I\u2019m going somewhere I probably won\u2019t have options at. She should be understanding of that - it\u2019s the universal experience of vegans to bring a granola bar or pb&j to a party or wedding when you have no idea if there will be options for you. \n\nYou did the right thing. She was being dramatic. If she was allergic to eggs that would be a different story. I\u2019m sorry she didn\u2019t care enough to label the food you could eat (why on earth would she have to make 2 types of mashed potatoes. Just do the one with almond milk. It\u2019ll taste the same)", "NTA.  Kim is vegan by choice (and privilege), but OP has dietary concerns by necessity.  It was an AH move to make OP eat in their car and I don't blame them for just leaving and being made to feel that unwelcome.\n\nInfo: How often does Kim expect to have her vegan restrictions accomodated?", "NTA and I really want to understand who is raising these people. I get that it's her home, her rules, but if you're going to invite guests to your home, you should at least make a slight effort to be a good host. And that includes accommodating food allergies. If you are unwilling to provide food that meets your guests' needs, then you should be okay with them bringing their own food. And if you aren't? Then why are you hosting a freaking social event in the first place? \n\ntl;dr: Kim isn't your friend. And people siding with her clearly don't understand the risks of food allergies.", "Kim is not your friend.  She is an entitled, ablest brat who thinks her preferences are more important than your medical disability.  Cut her off and anyone who thinks she's in the right, because you're at very high risk of being intentionally poisoned the next time you see these people.  I certainly would never trust anyone who thinks this isn't a big deal to not try to \"teach you a lesson.\"  Kim already tried to feed you unsafe food.\n\nAlso, soy allergies suuuuuuuuuuck, I'm sorry.  That shit is in everything.", "NTA. This is a bit ridiculous imo. And I am a vegan. I assume she can be in the workplace and see people eating meat and dairy? Did she also stop anyone from entering who had leather in their shoes or perhaps a leather patch on their jeans or beeswax in their mascara?\n\nAs a hostess she can have requests of her guests but at the point that you choose to host you\u2019re relinquishing some control. Her home will never be fully vegan as long as she\u2019s inviting guests over.", "NTA - you have an allergy and she forgot? which dish had soy in it. What? In what world is that okay? If she can't make safe food for you to eat she needs to let you bring your own food. Send her out to the car every time she comes over to eat at your place. Your house is now non-vegan. Or better yet next time you cook her something, make two, one cooked in fat and one with oil, and lets see if she eats it!", "NTA, and ain't it funny how there are entire cultures that practice part-time veganism and somehow manage not to include any soy?\n\nCome on over to my place and I'll fix you my kickass vegan chili and a stack of tortillas.  Or my black-eyed peas delicious and a pot of rice.  Or my raise-the-dead split pea soup (so called because when you feel like death and nothing is appealing you can still enjoy it) and whole wheat bread.  I am happily omnivorous and I got this figured out...what's her excuse?", "NTA.\n\nVegan household... Please...", "NTA. this kind of shit is why people hate vegans. they're ALL self-righteous assholes.", "NTA.", "NTA. Kim is the reason people do not like vegans.", "NTA I\u2019m a vegan and Kim is being ridiculous. Vegans like this are genuinely the minority and piss me the fuck off cuz they make the rest of us look so bad.\n\nYou didn\u2019t ask to come into her house and cook up some bacon you brought. She didn\u2019t make sure the food was safe for you to eat! She should know you either needed to your food eat inside or leave. Eating in the car is so unreasonable.\n\nMy friends LOVE my vegan food, but I\u2019d also never be upset if they wanted to bring their own food. And as long as it\u2019s not meat with a really strong smell (like bacon has) they can even cook up their meat at my place as long as they don\u2019t expect me to do it and thoroughly clean.\n\nShe essentially kicked you out for having mayo and that\u2019s honestly dumb as fuck if she\u2019s gonna also complain if you choose to leave because of it.", "NTA. I\u2019d have done the same thing. If she can\u2019t be bothered to remember which mashed potato has the soy milk then she should let you eat your own food in her house. I hope you smeared mayo on everything you passed on your way out.", "NTA i have soy intolerance and i will not risk it. thankfully my ppl have been so understanding and will check packaging and remember which dishes have things i can\u2019t eat, because that\u2019s just what you do when you care about someone. also, its not starting drama if someone asks a question and you answer honestly.", "You're NTA. Kim's rude and self righteous attitude on top of her inability to be able to tell you which of the mashed potatoes would not make you seriously ill left you with no choice but to leave.", "NTA. \n\n>Kim came over to me and said she could smell the mayo\n\nHer life must be miserable if she is offended by the smell of mayo. I would never step across her threshold again.", "NTA, how did you start a drama by giving an answer? If she thinks her actions better shouldn't be known than she shouldn't do them.", "NTA - it\u2019s 100% possible to make vegan food without soy, Kim made it so you couldn\u2019t eat. The one starting drama is not the person who decided to leave when the host made it clear they weren\u2019t welcome.", "NTA.\n\nKim has been on the receiving end of this behavior enough times that it's truly an AH move to turn around and do it to someone else. And why in the world would she make mashed potatoes with soy milk and mashed potatoes with almond milk? Just make them all with almond milk! Or put a little turmeric or chives in one so it looks different! This isn't even that hard, ffs.\n\nOf course, she should know better than to offer up mashed potatoes and raw veggies as the only options for someone, because she's been on the receiving end of \"a side dish and some raw veggies is enough food for dinner, right?\". This is really lazy and a complete lack of empathy from someone who should know better.\n\nYou're not an asshole for leaving because your host failed to make you feel welcome. I understand Kim's morals and stance about not allowing non-vegan foods in her house, but if she can't make some simple changes to her recipes to accommodate her guests (it can be soy free and vegan!), she shouldn't be hosting in the first place.", "Why to some people accommodating to others in these circumstances is so burdensome? \n\nI have a friend that can\u2019t eat gluten and it wasn\u2019t a problem at all making sure there was something she could eat at my birthday dinner. Didn\u2019t kill me. I was glad she could eat like everyone else. NTA.", "My daughter came home for Christmas, she is lactose intolerant. Many people don't know because she doesn't make a big deal about it. \n\nI asked everyone to consider her when picking out food.... Don't feel like you can't bring anything with dairy. But if you're picking out biscuits and there's a choice between ones with dairy and ones without. Pick the without. \n\nEVERYONE made an effort and she had so many choices. It was just so lovely. She's used to going to parties and not being able to eat hardly anything. I was so grateful that everyone cared and made that extra effort. \n\nBut you know what... That's how people who care about you treat you. \n\nIf I were you, I would never go out of my way to make sure there's a vegan dish for her. I just don't have friends who don't care about me. So she would go from friend to acquaintance that very night. And I would have no problem letting everyone know why.", "NTA", "NAH- You left because you were hungry and couldn't eat any of the food being served. It's quite that simple.

If she can't tell the difference between potatoes made with soy vs. almond milk by tasting them, she would have had to reason to make two separate batches.

Seriously mashed potatoes and diced up veggies is it? And couldn't remember which was safe? That was entirely passive aggressive on her part. Also if she has a smart phone, computer, etc her home is not vegan friendly. Same with a lot of other items she 100% uses in daily life.

Same flipping difference.", "NTA.\n\nYou clearly expressed your needs and asked for a well justified, easy to oblige accommodation from a host who volunteered herself in the first place. Then you went ahead and prepared a back up plan just in case.\n\nOn the other hand, Kim is a host. Therefore she has responsibilities to accommodate her guests to the best of her abilities. Also an allergy is an important point to consider and offering only some mashed potato that may or may not be harmful to you is at best distasteful and at worst malicious.\n\nOn top of that, her refusing to accommodate your back up plan is very unwelcoming and unfriendly and it being winter or night doesn't even matter under the circumstances she created in the first place that led you to opt for eating your own food.\n\n(and it's your relationships with these people so maybe it's not place to comment on that part, but if it were me, I'd start questioning the sincerity of those friends who don't find a problem with the way Kim treated you.)", "NTA.

That's disgusting, especially as you didn't even ask her to violate her vegan views, just to adjust the menu slightly. Aside from that, how does she expect an adult to subsist on JUST mashed potato?

But they have to be reasonable about it and absolutely must ensure that everyone has something that they can safely eat without a reaction. Kim is firmly TA in this case because she was aware of OP's soy allergy and didn't do shit to try and cater to it.

Except that one time 25 years ago when I got food poisoning from a batch. It was a TERRIBLE weekend and I avoided hummus for about a year.", "This! We're vegan and eat a bunch of soy, nuts, legumes, etc. It takes a bit of awareness to not cross contaminate when hosting our friend with the nut allergy, but it's really not that complicated.", "i mean, just get some coconut milk, some curry paste, veggies, rice. Done.", "The fact Kim almost seemed to be waiting for OP to try and sneak something (how tf did she smell mayo in a small amount? Is she a bloodhound?) makes me think spite", "Even if everything else did have soy, why did she also need mashed potatoes with soy milk? Why not only make almond milk potatoes instead of two mashed potatoes that are both vegan, but one is also deadly for no reason?", "I cook vegan about three times a week unintentionally and I never, ever buy or use soy products. It's totally possible to make nutritious, good vegan food without ground \"pork\" made out of soy beans.", "Mashed potatoes are great... With butter. I suppose the type of milk doesn't matter, but butterless mashed potatoes sound absolutely nasty!", "Actually, the standard recipe I have used for peanut sauce includes soy sauce so even though your title doesn't include the word soy, many recipes contain soy sauce or other soy derivatives and it is not such an easy request to make to cook everything without soy. She could have done it, but not so simple as tons of vegan and even non-vegan sauces etc contain soy.", "100% this\n\nit's unnecessary to create a second batch with soy milk. if for some reason you really desperately want to make the same side dish twice, you at least play up the flavours. one could have been garlic, one could have had chives   \n\ntwo of the same thing is also inherently risky because people could screw up which serving spoon goes with which  \n\nso she gave herself twice as much work why? and then also somehow screwed it up?? nah, she lied   \n\nshe lied twice  \n\nbecause if you can't meet someone's allergy needs, what you do is ask the guest if they can bring their own food. but she didn't want that\n\nshe didn't want to make something without soy but she didn't want OP to bring something non vegan. so she lies, says she'll try, and then lies again and said that she did but she messed it up", "I asked bc i wanted to know if it was required; by their religous sect or a choice.

A vegan person does not eat animal products but may also not use animal products in other forms (such as leather.) That\u2019s why things like vegan leather exist - no one is expecting you to eat the vegan leather purse, it\u2019s just not made with animal products. \n\nVeganism can indeed refer to both lifestyle and diet.", "So, like I very clearly said previously. You can add something to your own personal ethos. But that doesn't mean that's what \"vegan\" itself means, or that you can redefine out other people that you decide aren't vegan enough for your tastes.\n\nAnd *plastic* exists because it's cheap. Just because some people also have a moral qualm about using a material that's less toxic doesn't mean it was why it was created. Again, you're adding an additional philosophy to something already extant and trying to redefine its meaning.\n\nVeganism is a diet, don't try to redefine it to gatekeep.", "The dictionary definition is: \u201ceating, using, or containing no food or other products derived from animals\u201d and the Vegan Society defines veganism as \u201cA lifestyle that avoids all animal foods such as meat, dairy, eggs and honey; animal derived products like leather; and, as far as possible, products tested on animals.\u201d\n\nSorry, but you are categorically incorrect: veganism is NOT limited to diet. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have a vegan diet and still wear leather, but diet is only one facet or not using animal products.", "You just used the adjective definition for vegan *food* and such, and the word of an animal rights organization. Just because you really want this definition to be the primary one, we both know how hard you have to reach to get this- I *saw* that embarrassing comment you deleted last time you tried to define vegan.\n\nYou can have all the extras you want, but people trying for a political movement surrounding a dietary choice don't get to gatekeep out anyone else who makes that dietary choice.", "NtA and fun fact I learned from moving to a farming community, her house isn't vegan. Pig parts are used to make all sorts of things that hold her house together. So unless she has built the house herself and knows exactly what everything is made of then she isn't even living the lifestyle she is such a hard ass about. I totally understand and support people who are vegans btw, but it isn't fair to enforce that on others to that extent. You weren't cooking meat in her house or rubbing it in her face and if she is going to be that anal then it's on her as the host to provide you with safe options. It just blows my mind the people who take things to this level yet I guarantee they don't question where a lot of the things they need to survive come from and how we all have to pick and choose our battles when it comes to how much we can be environmentally friendly and maintain our Lifestyles.", "Lol. We all know that vegan would have acted like a vegan and made a big vegan deal out of not having a vegan meal.\nFacts.", "Seriously -- Kim hasn't heard of salad?  Bread?  Pasta?  I'm flabbergasted by mashed potatoes being the only non-soy offering.", "Kim is being a total AH about her ideals. She can Google thousands of vegan recipes without soy any time she bothers to try. She's not very bright and she's a lousy friend! Ideals my arse.", "The reason the \u201cfriend\u201d would bother to cook with soy, knowing that a guest had an allergy to soy, is twofold\u2014the first (and biggest reason) is that she is NOT a friend. Spin it any way you\u2019d like, that\u2019s not something a friend would do. It\u2019s something that a passive-aggressive person would do to someone they don\u2019t like. \nThe second reason is that some vegans are militantly vegan and want everyone to know it. This \u201cfriend\u201d seems to fall into that category, considering she claimed she \u201ccould smell the mayo\u201d and demanded that it not be brought into her house. Mayonnaise, when used as a spread on a sandwich doesn\u2019t have enough of an odour to be smelled anywhere beyond a few inches\u2014if used in a pasta salad, you\u2019re not going to smell it much beyond arm\u2019s length, and that\u2019s only if you really gloop the mayo on there. OP\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d was being an AH by being one of the militant vegans\u2014the kind of vegan who the whole joke about \u201chow do you tell if someone is a vegan? Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll tell you\u201d was made about.", "What other things did she make that you could eat other than cut up veggies and mashed potato (that you couldn\u2019t eat because she couldn\u2019t be bothered labelling one)?\n\nI have several vegetarian and vegan friends, and when I play host, I always label what they can eat or let them bring their own. It\u2019s just courtesy. NTA BTW.", "I\u2019m super curious for an update on this situation. She sounds like she hates you or something, so there may be an underlying reason why she never accommodates you and ONLY you.", "Agreed. My husband and I threw a bbq and we made 5 dishes that were vegan for one person in attendance. This is not rocket science. As a host, you have a certain (not unlimited) responsibility to make guests comfortable. Which includes: no one goes hungry. \n\nOP is NTA", "This was my thought. It\u2019s all mashed potatoes. And it\u2019s all vegan. It\u2019s so weird.", "This. When my (vegan/veggie/omni) friends come over we cook a vegan community meal because it\u2018s easier. Last time it was bolognese. But we got snacks and breakfast with vegan/dairy/meat options. Kim sounds exhausting.", "It's reasonable for a vegan to want a vegan household. Not so reasonable for her to not provide anything soy-free to accomodate her friend's allergy.", "Oat milk! Not 100% but it works. If you need a thickener use arrowroot.", "Before reading this, I never realized how much I don\u2019t eat soy. But I have done all sorts of diets. I have IBS and soy absolutely destroys my digestive system in large amounts. And soy is often met with gluten. And soy milk is just gross. But all of this this to say, it\u2019s quite easy to avoid soy in a vegan diet. Idk what her issue was.", "Oh I agree. If OP just wanted to bring in non-vegan food jus because, then he's an AH. But that's not the situation. She failed to provide food he can eat without getting sick, so OP's medical needs of being able to eat something that won't harm them should trump her moral needs of no animal products in her house.", "In some ways that's worse, because it's not ignorance, it's just being deeply inconsiderate and a terrible host.", "Man, these sound awesome and i don\u2019t have any restrictions!!!", "Now I\u2019m hungry. Your list sounds delicious.", "But what you said right there is the real kicker. The type of milk doesn't matter, so why would she make two versions, one with soy and one with almond milk? Just make one with almond milk that everyone can eat. So bizarre.", "She could've used margarine or olive oil, those are good substitutes!", "Yes! I ENJOY hosting my friends and part of that is hosting *for them specifically* in accordance with their needs. What a thoughtless jerk.", "Note to friend group: don't let Kim host again. She is pushing all her food requirements on the entire group but can't guarantee you that she'll accommodate yours and refuses to let you eat your food inside because she couldn't remember which single dish you could actually eat. WTF.", "Kim could smell the mayo. Kim is apparently a beagle. \n\nNTA. I could care less if someone brings their own food to my outing.", "NTA - I would never invite a vegan and say \u201coh I can\u2019t remember which potatoes I made with regular milk or vegan milk\u201d and then get mad if they whipped out their own milk\u2026", "ALSO, it is not a dietary choice, is an allergy, and, depending on the gravity, can cause serious reaction.\nMy best friend is vegan and I'd never cook for her something non-vegan, and I'm extremely careful with cross contamination because I know how important it is to her.\n\n \nI'm allergic to latex, and when I eat at her place, she washes the dishes and appliances again before using them because she wears latex gloves for washing the dishes, my allergy in not bad at all, yet she takes the time to do that just in case. She even says that if she ate for any reason something non-vegan, she would feel awful (it happened once when the recipe for her favourite store bought cookies changed and milk was added), but I happened to come in contact with latex i could end up in ER.\n\nAnd that's how friendship and love works.", "Agreed! If the situation was reversed, I bet it would have been a big issue to her! She's one of those vegans who expect you to cater to there dietary requirements,  but when it comes to anyone else's  they either don't care or barley does anything to cater to there guests. She's a bad host. \n\nI'm just greatful that the vegans I know are not that inconsiderate. OP's friend is the asshole.", "Yeah, Kim is an extremely militant vegan. I mean OP didn't even come with meat. She came with a vegetarian dish.", "Saying \"veganism is great\" isn't a problem.  Saying \"You WILL be vegan when I'm around!\" is not.  Telling someone to go eat in their freezing car is rude, obnoxious, and disrespectful of their humanity.  She's no friend.", "Your standards are too low! Unless you've got loads of allergies you don't EVER need to eat soy to be vegan. The fact that there are so many vegan products on the market means only that the soy industry is creative.\n\nMany cultures have cuisines that are significantly vegan and have been for thousands of years. They just don't use the word \"vegan\", which is a newish word.\n\nYou DO need to rethink your concepts of what a meal is. The American standard of a chunk of meat or bird plus two veg, is only a product of 20th century politics, it wasn't handed down from Mount Sinai. \n\nPlease, for the sake of your own palate, start googling for vegan soy-free recipes and maybe go to the library and study some vegan cookbooks.", "You have my sympathy. (I personally have severe reactions to food containing gluten.) Also, this is actually a salient point - apparently she complained about mayo, and you now reveal you carefully source your eggs from a place you personally know how the birds are handled, and that includes them having some roaming space. \n\nWhile you could have made an effort to make your meal vegan as well (as indicated elsewhere, one meal isn't that big a deal), as I understand it was a backup plan in the first place. She chose to make it an issue at several levels.", "> Which really sucks because I love Chinese food but got to make it at home.\n\nAs a white guy with very little cooking talent, you're honestly better off making it yourself unless you wanna spend fancy-money at a sit-down restaurant.  I've found this to be true for most foods, not just Chinese, but a little effort in the kitchen seems to produce better results than 80% of food I can buy in a reasonably priced restaurant.", "Kim seems to have an obsession with soy, like everything has to have it in it. Maybe she is a horrible cook and thinks she can only get with that ingredient taste into her food. That is not an excuse of course. \n\nI am not a very experienced cook myself and I think I can still come up with something soy free and vegan which made people full. Last option would be just some pasta with bought tomato sauce from the supermarket or even just get a can of vegan food like vegan ravioli for OP and put it into the microwave. Not ideal, but better than letting a guest go hungry or sending her out into the cold and dark.", "I love to cook, and we have a vegan in the group who cooks professionally, so you best believe whenever I have the girls for dinner it's all vegan and allergy friendly. \n\nI'll go even more extra for holiday meals - I did a Xmas dinner for 13 which took into account not only veggies and vegans but a caeliac disease and lactose allergy. \n\nI did do meat for that meal as half of us were meet eaters but I made everything I could vegan friendly - eg sprouts with veggie bacon, veggie gravy, maple syrup instead of honey on my roast carrots and parsnips. The only thing I made 2 of was roast potatoes cos Xmas is the only time I have goose fat potatoes and they were my treat! \n\nAll this to say it's so SIMPLE to not be a dick! Literally.", "We have hosted plenty of vegetarian friends and a few vegan ones, plus friends with allergies. We have always made sure that the majority, if not all, of the food is edible by everyone. It's not always easy, especially with allergies, but there are usually tons of recipes online with replacement ingredients and all sorts of suggestions when it comes to substitutions. And it's so worth it to make a friend feel welcomed and wanted.", "I think vegan gets a bad rap from the vegan monsters who make it miserable for everyone else. I love a perfectly rare steak, but can also roll with a vegan menu, no problem. Also, so many dairy subs are so amazing. There are ways around it.", "That's the thing. She's being extremely passive aggressive to the point that it's obvious she doesn't even like OP. They're not friends, OP just thinks they are.", "Yeah I didn't call her a friend in my comment either. \n\nFor second part I really don't understand what her issue was, he was asking for vegan dish? \ud83e\udd14", "> or let them bring their own.\n\nI thought that was a base part of being a good host?  There are foods that will literally make me gag, but if a friend showed up with some, I'd turn on the fan and open a window so they could still enjoy inside.  \"Go eat in your car because my dumbass forgot which mashed potatoes are dangerous for you.\"  Get the fuck outta here!", "Agreed! I\u2019m also allergic to soy and sadly developed an eating disorder because I hated grocery shopping because a) I hate shopping and b) everything I wanted had soy in it! I couldn\u2019t just run in and get something. I\u2019d be there for hours on end reading labels. It was frustrating. I\u2019d just have some go to cereal or not eat at all.
