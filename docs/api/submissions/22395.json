I think they just thought it was spare, and thought they could grab it.  It was first row so it was in a good location to the water. I got to the beach about 830 so I could get a prime location and a car park. The incident happened around 12, when the first 3 rows were full", "It was busy, but there were still sunbeds available, people coming and going all the time.

If the place had been packed with no  spare sun beds it would have  been a bit uncool but given that wasn\u2019t the case, I don\u2019t see a problem with this.", "No reason to second guess at all. They\u2019re just looking to freeload. That\u2019s a \u201cthem\u201d problem.

You\u2019re 100% right to say no, next thing they\u2019d be changing the umbrella and making you feel less comfortable in your space.", "Nta.

OP paid for both so they're entitled to use both.", "Your stuff was on it?? Omg the audacity of that dude!", "If the beach has been very busy when OP has arrived, I think it would have been uncool to book two sun beds. However clearly this wasn\u2019t the case here so absolutely NTA.", "NTA. I do this too when I'm on my own and if anyone else asks, I tell them I paid for it, so it's mine. I also put a towel or shirt on it, that reduces the chances od other folks trying to grab it - most days no one asks. Obviously if I don't pay for it, it's up for grabs.", "NTA. You weren't being selfish, they were being cheap. You can't walk into a McDonald's and expect to grab someone's burger because they bought 2. And this situation is no different.", "NTA - You paid for 2 right? Unsure how you're selfish.\nThe other person is selfish for taking something that another user has already paid for.\n\nIt's like being on a plane. You bought 2 seats for yourself.

It\u2019s up to the resort/club to limit loungers to the number of guests if they want such a policy. The establishment obviously just wants lounger money no matter if they are used or not. You are just following the rules as they are. She can complain and ask for policy change from the club if she doesn\u2019t like it.

The correct thing would have been for her to ask how early you\u2019d recommend she get there next week to get in the front row.

What for is YOUR business. NTA", "If the place was packed and not a damn lounger was available, you would still be NTA. They chose to come late. Not your problem. You did what you had to do to get what you needed to have the day you wanted. They didn\u2019t. That\u2019s how you learned. If someone wants a lounger in the row near the water they can get off their azz and get there early.\n\nAll you folks saying she\u2019s only NTA only if there are open loungers can go kick rocks. People pleasers shouldn\u2019t give advice.", "Because it's toilet paper, an essential that EVERYONE needed, but didn't need almost 100 rolls of.

Op wasn't hoarding anything, they were using what they paid for.", "NTA. You PAID for it.", "I have no idea what your are talking about I'm not sure what a sunbed is? Or why you'd pay for a lounger?

There are free parts of the beach where you can set up your own spot. It's very convenient if you don't want to lug your own stuff to beach, or lie on the sand."]}
