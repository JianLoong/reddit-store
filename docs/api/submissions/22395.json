It's yours to use as you desire. \n\nThat person can bugger off and go pay for their own lounger and umbrella.", "I probably would attempt to make it look like somebody was in it but was out in the water or just walking around.

Do they think they can move into your spare bedroom just because it's empty  and you don't need extra space?

You paid for it, it\u2019s tough tits if they don\u2019t like it. The system on beach loungers can be brutal, but with 1,000 sun beds for multiple clubs?

I think they just thought it was spare, and thought they could grab it.  It was first row so it was in a good location to the water. I got to the beach about 830 so I could get a prime location and a car park.

They\u2019re just looking to freeload. That\u2019s a \u201cthem\u201d problem.

You have a right to do as you choose as long as you pay for it.", "No, they just thought no one was using it so they could claim it", "Doesn't matter. OP paid for both so they're entitled to use both.", "Your stuff was on it?? Omg the audacity of that dude!", "If the beach has been very busy when OP has arrived, I think it would have been uncool to book two sun beds.
