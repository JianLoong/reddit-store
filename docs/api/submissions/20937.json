Be courteous to those living in their same households and have compassion for medical difficulties. I\u2019m curious if you both live at home and how disrespectful the noise would be for your parents to hear! If you live on your own (bravo for doing so at 18!) your brother is a major AH and his girlfriend isn\u2019t much better. I\u2019d be mortified if my boyfriend\u2019s brother asked me to be quieter during sex.", "NTA\n\n50F here.  Real adults make accommodations for their roommates/housemates needs.  Real adults are considerate of people around them and keep the noise down when others can hear.\n\nReal adults know how to get their stealth fuck on.", "NTA, and asking the internet what we would do is dangerous. Everyone\u2019s got different comfort levels. You could start cheering them on every time they go at it to make it awkward (\u201cYEAH BROTHER GET IT!\u201d), you could invite a friend of his over and turn it into a competition, you could start dropping embarrassing stories about him growing up\u2026\n\nI mean the most mature thing to do would to be involve your parents. Why are they absent in this? Are you two living alone?", "NTA!  \n\nSex, or loud music, or loud conversations, there's no difference.  People have to respect each other's space and time.  Would loud music or shouting be acceptable during normal sleep hours?  No.  Neither is loud sex.  Sounds like your roommate doesn't respect you at all, that he's your brother makes it worse.", "The cheering them on comment is good. Also, in response to him saying he'll be louder just to piss you off, say \"it's pretty gross to be thinking of me while fking your girlfriend.\"\nBasically, make it as uncomfortable for him as it is for you and maybe they'll go elsewhere.", "Record their noises and when they are asleep play it back to them really loud and see how they like it", "You should play that one song from the guy on Reddit every time they have sex.

Trashy. \n\nNTA.", "NTA wtf if this was my brother, he would be MORTIFIED I had heard??? real adults can ask each other for things and come to solutions instead of being perry, too", "NTA. As for solutions, um maybe put a disgusting video on a bluetooth speaker and blast it?  Or stupid music?  The oompa loompa video has a 10 hour loop. If he complains, hey im just tryna to cover up your sex noises. This is what adults do, they play music loudly.", "Personally, I'd buy an air-horn and whenever they woke me up, I'd crack open the bedroom door and sound it.\n\nThat should be enough to quell their ardour, if only for a few minutes. It would, however, hack off anyone else that lives in the house but hey...\n\nNTA btw", "NTA, take an audio recording of them bumping uglies and play it contentiously when they in the common areas. Play it when they have guest, your brother made it clear he doesn't mind others listening to him have sex.", "Just be as unhinged as possible.

Be a menace.", "Record it and then play it for her parents if they ever come by", "Take a video and put it in the family group chat. NTA", "NTA. Your brother says \"this is what adults do\". He's not behaving like an adult though by deliberately making things more awkward a d uncomfortable. Have you thought about some noise cancelling headphones? You shouldn't have to buy them but they do come in useful for on other occasions too. Good luck.", "Definitely NTA", "NTA. They aren't being adults. Adults are respectful and reasonable. He's being a petulant kid. And kids shouldn't be having sex at all.", "OP, its time to wreck their fun. Interrupt them every time and they will soon stop.", "NTA. if i were you i would tell them that if they continue to be that loud, your gonna kick them out. your being kind enough to let them live in your house, the least they could do is quiet down a bit", "Play a recording of a screaming newborn everytime, The whole time. If they ask say \"this is the result of your adult actions\"", "Nta\n\nGet some noise canceling headphones and crank baby shark", "NTA... Record them and play it for your parents in front of your brother and girlfriend. Everybody gets to hear!", "NTA. I\u2019m not gonna address why; other commenters already did. Your brother is being a rude jackwagon here. \n\nThat said, when they go low, we go lower. So you need to find some primo audio (I like Fat Bastard \u201cget in my belly\u201d for example, but also a big fan of My Fair Lady - the part where it\u2019s Prof. Higgins playing a recording of him making vowel sounds MOST obnoxiously and unsexily) and BLAST it. Maybe Barney? Sesame Street? Oooooh, what about Baby Shark??  Every single time they have sex, and they start to be loud, you crank the volume up, put some noise-canceling headphones on so *you* don\u2019t have to hear it, and just play the most boner-killing shit you can find AT MAX VOLUME. I recommend a nice, LOUD speaker for good measure, too. Face it to the wall and let them enjoy their new sex soundtrack.
