Plus his tiktok page is also his \"class\" tiktok page because \"you realize no one watches YouTube since 2017.\" He said he's not hiding anything and this is what teachers do to make dense subject material interesting. Then he thanked me for being a concerned \"Daddy\" as a backhanded insult.\n\nI replied that none of my son's other five teachers is doing what he's doing and probably because they don't have time to play on TikTok.

OP does not dispute the fact that that was in the agreement.", "I say NTA dude, point #1 screams at me.", "> Tiktok to education is Mountain Dew is to dentistry\n\nWell yeah kinda proving my point there", "I don't know what you signed.  What did it say?\n\nIf it was a generic statement that he could use videos of your child... then yes, I wouldn't rule anything out.  I never sign anything that lets teachers use photos or videos of my children.", "The school can prohibit their employees from filming as a condition of their employment, but absent that prohibition there's no law against publishing video or photos obtained legally that couldn't be overturned as prior restraint of the press.", "It's a public building, and the teacher has the right to be there. No different than some rando in a park with a camera. You may not like it, but there nothing you can do legally to stop it.", "Which part, exactly? Do you know the laws? Enlighten me.", "Most reddit users are Americans. It takes someone who is extremely dense not to realize what I'm saying is a right everywhere, but outside of the United States, the government infringes on those rights.", "The internet is full of videos involving lawyers, cops, public employees and random citizens who make up laws and imaginary rights as an excuse to harass someone who's just taking pictures in a public place, getting owned by an ordinary citizen with a camera who know their rights. Do you think you have to be a lawyer to understand your rights? I feel sorry for you,", ">They can put it on any website they want, as long as it\u2019s school promotion.\n\nThat is not how it works.  Either way, OP can revoke permission AT ANY TIME and it seems like she/he already did.", "[deleted]", "Uses videos and pictures isn\u2019t the same as posting your kid on TikTok. You ok?", "does that matter? that's not a legally binding contract and OP can revoke consent at any time.", "I don't know how you can be both so wrong and so certain that you're right.", "FERPA says otherwise. Privacy in a school is not the same as privacy in public. There are thorny issues around protective orders, custodial issues, it's easier to require permission from everyone so at risk students aren't singled out to their peers.", "It may be public, but if a homeless person walked into that building looking dodgy (aka peado) they'd be escorted out. All adults that meander into this \"public\" building have to be staff or parents and not just members of the public. Therefore not everyone has access to the building and isn't an actual public place for videoing. \nEvery child's parent has the right to say no to pocus and videos of their child especially if they're being put on the Internet.", "It\u2019s a public building but parent and kid don\u2019t have a choice as the kid is attending school and this a class assigned to the kid.", "Think about this for a couple seconds dude: try to go to a public middle school library during school hours. Just think for two seconds what the reaction from people there would be... Like REALLY actually think for a sec", "You \u201c I don\u2019t know any of this for a fact but I will type it out like I do anyways\u201d", "Yup, they can. Nobody argues they can\u2019t. However, revoking your permission when nothing has changed is an AH move.", "Telling a teacher they can't put your kid on tiktok is not being overbearing.", "Yes, but on the scales I don't think it really measures up to the other reasons.", "He \"uses videos and pictures of his students\". So that's not \"I use videsos in my lessons\", that's \"I'm using videos and pictures of my students\".", "Well it does matter.  He was telling the teacher he had no consent, but in fact he did.\n\nHe can revoke it if he wants, but he was wrong at that time.", "Obviously he can revoke consent at any time. However, he IS an AH for misrepresenting: In the current situation (dad has given consent), his son CAN give consent to be on there.", "Also, yes, it does matter: If you've agreed to something, you're kind of an asshole for suddenly changing your mind. Well within your regal rights to do so, but still an AH.", "It doesn't matter if you think it's wrong. Unless it's there's a law against it, there's nothing you can do about it, legally, and even then, laws that infringe on the constitutional rights get overturned on a regular basis. Do you really want to live in a world where it's illegal to take pictures?", "Ferpa applies to student records, not people with cameras who have every right to be in the place they're standing.  But you're right in that It's more polite to ask.", "Being homeless doesn't diminish a person's rights, but a person not attending or employed by the school would have no legitimate reason to be inside a classroom during school hours if they're not explicitly invited. If it were inherently wrong to take pictures or video, why does almost every public and private building have security cameras?", ">I sent an email to Mr. J telling him what I thought and my stance\n\nIf OP sent an email telling Mr. J that OP's stance was he shouldn't post the kid on tiktok then obviously consent has been revoked and arguing about what was consented to in the past doesn't matter. It's also unclear what exactly was agreed to, since \"using videos and pictures of his students\" does not necessarily imply posting them publicly on the internet on your personal social media account.", "> In the current situation (dad has given consent), his son CAN give consent to be on there\n\nThis is semantics at best. The child can't give consent unilaterally, the child's consent always is contingent on the consent of the parent.", "Oh stop. lol You are exhausting with your mental Olympics hahaha", "What?! Suddenly an asshole about something you\u2019re uncomfortable with for your kids? wtf lol Yeah, I\u2019m sure this 6th grade teacher had an air tight, fully explained agreement. Sure sure.", "> If you've agreed to something, you're kind of an asshole for suddenly changing your mind.\n\nI mean, na. OP has new information about what he was being asked to agree to, and that new information about where the videos are posted and how they're used is pertinent to OP's consent. I fully disagree that that makes anyone an asshole, especially when it comes to parents of children.", "It's certainly problematical to take video of children. You know that. You confusing your first amendment auditing nonsense with a legitimate right to privacy.", "Your argle bargle nonsense doesn\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re wrong.", "There's a difference between policy and law.\n\nThe school will have pages of policy that teachers and students need to adhere to.", "Because those images are not publicly viewable, they are restricted to people that have (supposedly) gone through a vetting process.", "\"using videos and pictures of his students\" is extremely generic, which is the problem and he never should have agreed to it without asking questions.  It certainly does not exclude social media by those words.", "Point is: You're agreeing to let someone use these videos for something, and then you change your mind. I think that makes you an asshole to the person you've given said permission. This has nothing to do with legality: If someone tells me I can use something they've made, I then use it in the way we've agreed it can be used, and then suddenly someone says \"Oh no wait, you can't\", yeah, then I think you're at least a little bit of an AH.", "All video footage taken by any public employee with any device while they're on the job is a public record subject to FOIA. Taxpayer funded schools are never private property.", "From OP:\n\n>It said in fine print that videos or photos may be used for school promotion\n\nThis is a clear misrepresentation of how he was actually using the videos. But even so, \n\n>It certainly does not exclude social media by those words\n\nThis doesn't matter, because now that OP has said \"you can't do it without my permission\" it's clear that permission has been revoked. If the parent believes permission has not been given, then whatever piece of paper you got them to sign is meaningless."]}
