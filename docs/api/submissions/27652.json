I said you can't even be trusted to shower every day let alone decide when you can appear on someone's tiktok page.\n\nSo I sent an email to Mr. J telling him what I thought and my stance. He replied that I gave consent when I signed his classroom  agreement that he uses videos and pictures of his students and no parent has ever complained. Plus his tiktok page is also his \"class\" tiktok page because \"you realize no one watches YouTube since 2017.\" He said he's not hiding anything and this is what teachers do to make dense subject material interesting. Then he thanked me for being a concerned \"Daddy\" as a backhanded insult.\n\nI replied that none of my son's other five teachers is doing what he's doing and probably because they don't have time to play on TikTok.

So it's not hard to imagine why plastering their likenesses online willy nilly is a terrible idea. Plus you've got other things like messy divorces, witness protection, immigratio status, we had a few cases where the children themselves were high profile (read entertainment industry) so you never know. Just better to have a form where a parent can express **NO**.

My god, knowing where a child goes to school is just a few steps off from straight up doxxing. \n\nAside from the fact that he's violating parents rights to control the use of their child's likeness, he's just being straight up negligent and endangering the kids. I've seen people at the institution I was in get fired for far less than what this wannabe influencer is doing.\n\nEDIT: I just realized 2017 lines up with when Youtube started getting forced to comply with COPPA. Well of course children's videos were getting fewer views on Youtube post 2017. Because Youtube started complying with the law to protect children from exploitation by advertisers.

Makes me wonder what his motive is. He's pulling the \"this makes education better\" card... I have to ask, does disrespecting a student's parent also improve education?\n\nIF a teacher is going to care about education like that, they're not going to half-ass their dedication by disrespecting parents in such an immature way. \n\nI may be over analysing but that is just very weird. Trying extra hard to emphasize his care for education to cover up something else, and throwing some backhanded insults for extra deflection.

I notified teachers before taking but since it was a huge event with families all over it was fine. I would never post publicly. I did post on my Instagram and MY children were the focus like normal event photos, my Instagram is private and I only add people I know personally.

Scorpions can be dickheads but Redhead Centipedes actively want to kill you. When the guy that's handled black widows tells you they won't touch a creature, that creature is not to be trifled with.", "As soon as he said no it became malicious.\n\nAlso, be the change you want to see. I can\u2019t imagine the teachers I had trying to do this. This isn\u2019t how the world works. My boss isn\u2019t gonna make tik tok videos to train us. School should prepare kids.", "I disagree. Trying to monetize off unconsenting children is gross. At least to me.\n\nCalling someone a concerned daddy is also weird, idk this read as gross. Parent asked it be removed it should be removed. Refusal makes it grosser.", "The problem is that a certain percentage of educators are constantly seeking to not be teachers. They want to move into the parts of education where the real money exists - being in some sort of administrative role, instructional coach/coordinator, director of curriculum, or outside education as a consultant. To do that, they need a portfolio showing how great they are as a teacher - not for the benefit of students, but for the benefit of themselves.\n\nAs a young teacher, I had an older peer tell me I have the skills to be a good principal. I stewed on this for days - I have never wanted to be anything but a classroom teacher, I love what I do and I love working with those kids. I finally had to ask him if he meant it as an insult - I had never heard any of that group of teachers ever say anything positive about admin. He actually did mean it as a compliment, fwiw. \n\nAnyways, the most frustrating thing for passionate teachers is the social climbers that flit around the profession, try to make us feel inadequate, then drift into a higher paid role. They never really wanted to do the job, it was just a stepping stone.", "I\u2019ve been retired a few years now, but in my district we were encouraged to document everything, make scrapbooks, and use it to succeed in our evaluations, which had become extremely complex. It was all Charlotte something something, who wrote a book with hundreds of domains that should be evaluated for every teacher. Probably one factor in my retiring early, to be honest.", "I think it depends on their experiences.  Some teachers are going to want to do that so that they have documentation of everything, so that when admin comes down on their ass and tries to act like they're a bad teacher, they can point to the pics to show that they produced student work.", "Yes. You would have to be the change or the parents. And if he puts up any more videos now that the dad has said no he would be malicious. Doesn't seem to have happened yet.\n\nAnd sorry to say but some bosses do direct towards training videos or heck tiktoks. School is meant to educate kids and this teacher found a method to get kids engaged and happy to learn MATH.\n\nA parent should prepare kids. A school is not a substitute for all parental failures. This is why your country(assuming US which is likely) has a massive teacher shortage.", "If they were interested in money they wouldn't be a teacher. And I highly doubt he gets any money from any of this. It's content made to appeal to his own students anyone outside isn't going to watch much of it.\n\nHe behavior to the father may be wrong but from what it sounds like this guy was maybe not the best communicator and it seems he gave consent when he signed an agreement which it seems like he didn't read and even asked the kids if they were OK with it. So he can revoke consent if he wants but eh. Seems like a non issue", "It\u2019s stupid that it has to come to it but time to draft a cease and desist letter and send it to the teacher and cc it to every school admin. That law is completely on the parents side on this one, insanely so if the teachers account really is monetized.", "I agree. He\u2019s probably monetized on his TikTok and the more content and engagement he gets, the more money he makes.", "I suspect that if one of my coworkers approached my Principal with the idea of having a class TikTok page where the students can show off their work and make class-related TikToks, she'd be all for it.\n\nIf a student can explain, for example, the water cycle, in a short video for TikTok, that indicates that they most likely understand the topic fairly well, and the video is their way of demonstrating mastery.\n\nThe use of TikTok as part of a lesson is a decent idea.  But it sounds like this guy didn't go through the official channels and just used his personal account, which is why mom was caught off guard.  He's fucked, and deservedly so, but creating content for social media can indeed be a useful aspect of the learning process."]}
