Your \u201cfriend\u201d is the reason her business is failing.\n\nEdit to add - if you not showing up for free is enough for the business to start failing, than you were obviously doing more than enough to get paid", "Nta.

NTA.", "Why do you still work there if she is not paying you, treat you like garbage and says you are not doing enough to get payed. You don't have to sell yourself for nothing. Tell her, she has to pay you or you stop coming there by the next day. She is taking advantage of you, don't let her", "Contact a lawyer, ASAP.", "NTA.  This one is simple.  Tell her to either pay you at least minimum wage or run the damn business herself.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is easy: Look up the minimum salary  - and sue her for all the hours you worked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd from today on, only work hours you get paid.", "It's how I was raised I would as horribly abused now if I do something to stand up for myself", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I expect back pay to (date) as you haven\u2019t paid me as agreed. \n(Maybe stick something legal about pay in here, I don\u2019t know what but sure someone else can help.)\nYours sincerely \nSomeone who is NTA and no longer a sucker.", "NTA stop working AND contact your department of labor! Report that you were working and have not been paid!", "Info: Did she hire you? Did you have an agreement on wages and job responsibilities? When you are hired, there is typically some documentation of that fact. In the absence of being officially hired, what did she do to lead you to believe you would be paid?", "NTA\n\nSTOP!   Don't help her anymore.  She hasn't paid you in almost three months?!  \n\nThat's a manipulative tactic saying you haven't done enough to get paid.  \n\nShe is the reason her business is failing.   \n\nGo further and cut ties.  She isn't your friend.", "NTA. Stop helping her completely. She hasn\u2019t paid you in 3 months? Honestly I\u2019d give her notice that unless all your wages are paid you\u2019ll follow a lawsuit.", "She\u2019s not paying you. \nNTA", "NTA, tell her she owes you three months of pay, or you will go to the Labor Board and report her. Do not work for her anymore. Her business is failing, because of her.", "Definitely NTA. If she wants to run a business she needs to be there full time.. it\u2019s ok to ask for help for an hr or 2 while u run errands but to open and close and be there all day, and not getting paid.. f that. I\u2019d be telling her, you kno, it\u2019s your business and it\u2019s not my fault your business is failing, it\u2019s yours.. you should be here not me, I don\u2019t get paid to run your business.. byeeee", "NTA. She isn\u2019t your friend. She is using you.", "NTA. \"Friend\" does not have a viable business plan. If a business person cannot afford to pay employees, they have a failing business.", "I was trying to help her get it restarted she was closed for 2 years I'm trying to stand up for myself it's just hard with the way I grew up I was horribly abused now that I'm not doing what I was doing she is really mad", "I have a really hard time standing up for myself I just don't anna make sure I'm not in the wrong", "She has made the comment just waiting on customer and clean the shop isn't enough to get paid she has also said I was sealing money she has came in her shop I told her to check them out or sh said must be sailing things and not telling her all cos I got a 99 cents canned tea one day and found a 20 on the sidewalk later she claimed was hers she lost", "That's what I was thinking but ive had ppl tell me oh well she needs help", "I have I have her for a few lawsuits one not getting paid two I broke my foot and ankle at her shop while on a step ladder", "Yep I had her write it down I've never worked for a self owned business before so I was a little worried and the agreement was 16 a hour", "I am after what I was told", "The longer you tie yourself to unhealthy situations, the longer you'll be unhealthy yourself.

This person is taking advantage of you.", "You will only be in the wrong if you continue to let her take advantage of you. She knows the kind of person you are and is using that against you.  You're not a partner in her business and have no obligation to help or work there even if she paid you.", "NTA.  Why would you feel  you are in the wrong?  Would you work for a stranger and not be paid?  Go find a job that pays you.  Tell this ahem \"friend\" that you now have a paying-job and that you can't/and won't be around anymore.  That is not a friend, that is a User and she has taken advantage of your kindness and meek nature.  If you can't confront her, write her a letter, leave it at the business, and leave your keys.  She is USING you.", "So what? Do you have a gold giving donkey at home, so you don't need any money? Do you need a reason to leave the house? If not. no, you don't have to help her. You have your own live. And you don't have to deal with such people who take advantage of you", "Sounds like you've had a rough time. Did you break your foot before or after your aunt's dog knocked you down the stairs? I'd suggest staying off stairs/ladders, particularly if you're prone to seizures. With your medical history, you might just want to apply for disability and find a safe job working from home. You can put your bum roommate to work cleaning your house! It's a win/win for everyone!", "In that case, definitely NTA. Look for the labor board where you live and report her. That should help force her hand to pay the wages that are owed. It should also avoid many of the costly attorney fees.", "I have been the last couple days she just texted me saying she thought I'd be different today cos of a talk we had but all she did was throw a potty party saying no one cares about her", "I have a really hard time standing up for myself I'm learning how to do it ho", "After just healed up from the surgery from my wrist being broke I'm also epileptic so ya it's been a hell of a year", "Block her. You say that you find it hard to stand up for yourself so stop giving her the opportunity to guilt you back into it. She's not a friend anyhow.", "You gotta bail. This woman doesn't respect you. Simple as that.", "NTA.  Now this person (NOT a friend!) is trying to guilt-trip you.  DO NOT let it happen.  Heck, print out a lot of these replies and leave them at the business for her to read.  You two did NOT \"have a talk\".  SHE wants her way.  She wants FREE labor.  Stop this now.", "I don't have many friends I just have a hard time cutting out bad ppl in my life I'm trying", "I'm not trying to be mean or anything. I'm just saying that if you block her, than you won't have to deal with her continued guilt tripping or pity parties that could lead you back into a bad situation that you've only just been able to get yourself out of. Just pressing that one button can help you a lot.", "NTA. Stand your ground. Her business, let her run it. You have done enough to help her. It is ok to say no more. It is not ok for her to try to guilt you into free labor. Next she will probably try to borrow money to keep her business afloat. Just say no, no excuses needed.", "She ist not your friend. I repeat: she ist Not your friend.", "I just texted her until I get my money she owes me and I see that she is going to pay m I'm done", "You won't get a thing, not even her thanks.", "Good job! Keep sticking to your guns. No pay, no work. The more you say no, the easier it gets to say it. I think you're going to be ok, just keep putting yourself first in your dealings with her.", "Well I told her I'm done until she gets my back pay to me and keeps paying me", "Update just got this information from my soon to be husband she has been telling him he should leave me cos on the days I run her shop she has been telling him he should leave me cos I'm not home in time too make his lunch for work and one day out of the 3 months I've been working for her mind u this was from 5 am to midnight the house was a little messy so I'm done with her and have blocked her"]}
