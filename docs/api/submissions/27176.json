This is a non issue yet here you are trying to make it one.", "Where does it say she wasn\u2019t excited for her? Was she meant to jump for joy at the prospect of her friend going on holiday? \ud83d\ude02", "The friend offered to help pay for her own daughter's trip. That language sounds like OP will be partially paying for the pleasure of babysitting a child on her international trip.", "Don't forget, it is implied that OP would partially fund it because her friend would kindly \"help out\" with the funding of the daughter. Not pay for her in full. Def not pay OP extra money in case of emergencies.", "The friend offered to pay.", "Being responsible for ANY kid when you are on vacation can ruin your trip.", "Who cussed anyone out? You're the only one coming after people in the comments.", "Yeah, this is all in OP's head, making the friend out to be an AH. She seriously said, \"Obviously, that didn't go over well because she changed the subject, so she was very mad\" and I'm just thinking, \"no that's a perfectly natural transition and a hint that she knew it was a lot to ask, but wanted to see if she could go if she paid\"", "The comment section reeks of individualism in which the word \u201cfriend\u201d means somebody you hang out with sometimes, and not a person who helps you (and that you help) when they can. Honestly, I wonder how angry these people gotta be on a daily basis if a simple question from a friend makes them jump to \u201cTHE AUDACITY AND ENTITLEMENT!\u201d", "Which is what she did, so why is the friend the AH per your judgement?", "Friends talk about trips they are going to take and other exciting things in their lives.", "I\u2019ll admit, my reaction might be, \u201cIf I give you some money, could you get my kid (or me) a few souvenirs? Only if it\u2019s not out of your way.\u201d \n\nBut I can\u2019t imagine asking for someone to go on the trip with them.", "Yes, why would people who can't afford to give their children everything they want to give them ever want to try to take opportunities to do so?\n\n\"We can't afford for all of us to go, but we can afford to pay her way, if you're going and wouldn't mind taking her along\" is actually incredibly lovely.  \n\nAnd it's fine for OP to not want to take her.", "LOL, I think maybe Proctologist is a bit older, from the time when \"My *x* went to *y* and all they brought me back was this stupid T-shirt*\"* shirts were the rage. My grandparent's used to get them for all the grand-kids when they went on a trip.", "She said she got the impression that it didn't go over well. Friend didn't just calmy say \"Ok- no worries, then\".  If she did, pretty sure this post wouldn't exist.", "She\u2019s didn\u2019t offer to pay\u2026 she offered to help with the cost, the distinction is significant. And no 16 year old is entitled to trip across the world. Yes, it was inappropriate for her friend to ask.", "No- but the OP said she got the impression that her saying no \"didn't go over well\". I agree with the statement that it takes major audacity to even ask.", "Why so hostile?\n\n\"You clearly haven\u2019t got many good friends, then,\" is an amazingly rude statement and not at all conducive to dialogue.", "She asked, OP answered. But the thing that made OP post here is she got the vibe that it didn't go over well. And yes, trying to rope your besty into international babysitting duties is an audacious ask, no matter how close the friend. Hell, I wouldn't ask a close family member for this unless it something they discussed as an option previously.", "I\u2019m glad to see one other person with the same perspective as me. I thought I was misreading the situation with the way other commenters are dunking on the mother.", "No, her friend isn't expected to throw a balloon parade, but her immediate response should not have been to reap a benefit.", "No, the friend offered to \"help\". That language says \"you would only have to pay for part of my child's vacation.\"", "Plot twist, she\u2019s OP\u2019s friend.", "OP indicates that she got the vibe that her response was not well-received.", "Not lovely. Presumptuous. More so because she seemed moody afterwards. When people shell out 10k for a once in a lifetime vacation, you don't ask if they can take your minor child along with them. That is borderline rude and entitled unless OP views this teenager as family. Based on what is written, that is not the case.", "Not lovely at all to impose your child on other people.", "lmao", ">\"We can't afford for all of us to go, but we can afford to pay her way, if you're going and wouldn't mind taking her along\" is actually incredibly lovely.\n\nThat doesn't even make sense. If they could afford 10K for this trip, they could definitely afford to all three take a trip to Australia if they planned it far enough in advance to get a deal on airfare (and even if they couldn't I think they could manage a week or two in Australia if they spent a couple thousand of that 10K on each plane ticket). It'd be even cheaper if only one parent went.", "Yeah, I figured, that's why I interjected, LOL. They're already gonna be mad at OP for the refusal, they're gonna be mad while she's on the trip, they'll probably get mad whenever they tell stories about it for years, so getting a cheap bauble from the place will 100% feel like an insult to them", "No one is entitled to any trip for that matter, and no one here said otherwise. If they are actual friends, and not just casual friends, there\u2019s nothing inappropriate about calmly asking for a favor.", "Ignore them, responded four times on this thread already, I think we might have found OP\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d.", "People are \"dunking\" on the mother because the mother said they would \"help with cost\" not pay all of the cost. There's a huge difference. Paying all the cost means the parents are paying for everything their child needs. Helping means they may only pay for the plane ride there or for food on the trip.", "This is how I understood it to. I came to the comments for clarification because I was like wait, what? Friend wants her to provide free child minding and help pay for the kids vacation too?!", "For a 10k trip overseas, asking your friend to babysit (and partially fund) a teenager is not merely asking for a favor. Maybe when they return, the friend can ask OP to pay for half of the kid's college education.  Nothing wrong with calmly asking for a favor, right?", "That friend has brass balls if this is the case."]}
