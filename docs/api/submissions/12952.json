However my husband and I spoke about it later and both agreed we wouldn't be around them without an apology. We made this clear to his grandmother and aunts and it's been radio silence from the aunts since. Now Easter is coming up and husband's grandma wants to see us and baby girl so we told her we haven't gotten an apology from aunts yet and since they'd be there we won't. Her response was that we should be over that by now because pulling a stunt like that was \"just how her girls are.\" I told her she knows better by now than to think I'd just let it go when it hasn't even been addressed since her girls are bold enough to pull a disrespectful stunt like that but are too afraid to respond when they're called out on their crap. Now she's telling anyone who will listen that I'm withholding her great granddaughter to get my way. The apology was my husband's condition, I was all for just cutting them both off, he at least wanted to offer them the chance to make it right.

Hell, they don't like OP because she's not being a doormat to them.", "The one thing she's did wrong was getting upset because she chose her daughters over her grandchild and now is facing the results of her choice.\n\nShe even threw the \"that's how they are\" card at OP when they knew better.\n\nIf she wants to invite her daughters to an event and defend them, she can have them. \n\nBut, she can't expect OP and her husband to suck it up and Be okay with it.", "It's telling an old lady that she should somehow force her middle-age daughters to do something. I don't know about your family, but I'd die of laughter if my mom tried to tell me what to do. It ain't grandma's responsibility to fix her problem with someone else. By the time you've got children of your own, you should be beyond pulling out \"if you don't do what I want, I'm telling grandma.\"", "This.\n\nI noticed that she's just as bad as her daughters.", "NTA.  An apology is literally the least you could ask for.\n\nAs for \"withholding\", well, a grandparent is not a parent.  She has no inherent or irrevocable right to see your child.  If she wants the whole family together, she knows how to make that happen."]}
