I assume it's your brother, since Mum claims genetic relation to them. What would she have done if it had been the husband?

The daughter I (40f) am raising with my wife is eight years old now, and it feels like every step of the way you're under so much scrutiny! Everyone's eager to see if your kid turns out broken or wierd because their parents are the same gender. You get used to filling in forms by crossing out where, (in our case), it says 'father'. You get used to people asking \"Which one of you is mum?\" or \"Who's the 'real' mum? The one who gave birth?\" The weird looks when you're out as a family. The occasional rant from an opinionated stranger. You *never* get used to it coming from family. Our daughter is biologically ours, (Yes, we are both her bio parents, all I will say about it is 'Yay, science'!), so we don't get that problem, but my mum still occasionally drops a hint or two that our daughter 'deserves' a father figure.

It is both AH move to the grandmother AND to Lucas to choose to discontinue their positive relationship, by framing the grandmother's mistake as toxic behavior, and implying it is a toxic belief.\n\nIt is my personal experience and opinion, speaking as an adoptee with a very explored experience, and who immersed deeply in dialogues within the adult adoptee community, that on the contrary, it is actually VERY UNHEALTHY and TOXIC to NOT acknowledge the differences and natural tendencies between bio & not bio, in adoption.  People's sentiments and physiological body responses to bio kin are normal, instinctual, and human, they are also not necessarily mutually exclusive to having an inclusive loving family that supports and loves someone of a different origin nor are they necessarily indicators of prejudice.\n\nLucas will not get that special bio-connection by being adopted. That is one of the losses that factor into the complex situation that is adoption. It is important to be educated on the immense amount of grief of losing that and it is important to acknowledge that is a very very real loss....it is important to be considerate when navigating when bios and adoptees are mixing: This means not saying things in front of him that rub it in his face aka that he lost/cannot have this basic thing most everyone else around him has ....BUT IT ALSO MEANS not endorsing a narrative that pretends like the instinctual way people refer and interact to bio kin, is a toxic behavior, as opposed to a very normal occurrence you can see literally everywhere in subtle expressions throughout society and families everywhere you turn.  By framing the grandmother's admission to feeling something different when holding a bio,  as toxic, you are all bypassing the real issue, and creating the framework to disenfranchise the grief.  If you frame grandmother as wrong for feeling the way she does about her bio kin, you are implying that the difference doesn't or shouldn't exist, you are setting the stage to have your adoptee grieving alone because they will be grieving something you are telling them doesn't or shouldn't exist. I guarantee you that either consciously or unconsciously the adoptee is picking up in the micro-expressions and mirroring of bio connections families all around them have that are not present in his own family, beyond the grandmother. It does the adoptee a disservice to pretend it's not there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedited for clarity", "NTA\n\nI don't get that mindset.  My brother adopted his wife's son and the whole family was thrilled that it was finally official...he's ours.", "NTA.  She just showed you and the rest of the family how she would treat Lucas going forward.  You are right to protect him.  She has no right to insist she be there.", "NTA. Your Mom needs to focus on thinking about why what she said hurt her family so she can make a sincere apology. And part of that is giving her son and grandson space to decide whether they are even ready to listen to her apologize. Acting defensive and making it all about her and her feelings is the opposite of what she should be doing.", "YTA. She made a mistake and has agreed to make amends. As much as children gravitate towards their bio moms and bio dads and have a hard time accepting their step parents, it is also possible that bio parents have a hard time accepting non bio kids and non bio grand kids. The blended family concept may seem alien for an older generation. We have to be graceful enough to allow them to learn.", "Adopted person here.  If my beloved grandparents had said something like that I would have been CRUSHED.  Blessedly, they had more sense and more open hearts than that.\n\nYou are NTA.  Your mom?  Holy hell.\n\nEven when NO ONE says shit like she did the adopted kid is always, at some level, unsure.  Bro and Hubs are doing right by Lucas.  And YOU are doing right by Lucas.", "that 'one mistake' devastated a little kid..", "NTA Gma doesn't deserve to be called such at all. I really, really do not get this 'blood' above anything relationship that some people have. It wasn't a slip of the tongue in that she didn't mean it. She has thought on it and actually believes it. Sometimes the best family is the family of choice and the blood family, or some of them anyways, is not worth one drop. She was cruel towards a child, her own son and his husband. She deserves to be excluded.", "Exactly. NTA at all.", "And, they also know what she\u2019s been thinking behind all those \u201cgreat actions\u201d.  They can\u2019t forget it now. And they won\u2019t stop worrying that she\u2019ll say or do something else based on those feelings of hers.", "I'm sorry...I'm new here,  but what does AH mean?", "Its not a singular comment, it shows a deep manifested mindset of blood related children being worth more than adopted ones. \n\nComments can be forgiven, the underlying mindset hardly.", "I wonder if there have been comments to OP's brother pushing for surrogacy on the part of OP's mom?  Maybe not in front of Lucas but to OP's brother and possibly his husband (although OP's mom seems like she wouldn't consider kids fathered by her son-in-law to be \"real grandkids\" either).", "I doubt it. Saying something that stupid and hurtful, followed by playing the martyr shows that introspection is not in her wheelhouse.\n\nBoth of my parents are like that.", "As a former five-year-old whose father told her that he cried when she was born because I lack hanging, golden genitalia, I concur.\n\nAs a fifty-plus woman, I can tell you that my relationship with my father never got better. I knew I was not wanted and not really loved. Hard to get over that.", "People \u201cdeserve\u201d a second chance when they\u2019re remorseful and have realized their mistake and taken steps to fix it. Sounds like grandma here is not doing any fixing to herself and merely wanting people to \u201cget over it\u201d and move on. That ain\u2019t happening.", "agree", "An adult who had been forewarned that there might be jealousy issues should be adult enough to keep thoughts in their head.\n\nShe had ONE JOB. She failed.", "Asshole", "If it was only one mistake, it was enough to earn her exclusion.\n\nBut I have to wonder if there's been stuff in the past regarding her brother that OP's not aware of. It may be part of a bigger pattern of hurtful behavior that prompted him to take action so swiftly.", "Makes me appreciate my emotionally distant parents. At least their disappointment was unspoken. \ud83d\ude43", "I agree it makes sense to have talked with her.  I agree it makes sense to tell her why what she said was wrong.  And the harm it did. And that it their decision to eliminate contact.\n\nI am also concerned about the impact of both the comment AND reducing contact has on the kid.  Brother and husband should be consulting a child therapist about how best to proceed.  Any choice is perilous.\n\nFor me, the question is whether you say someone deserves a negative outcome.  Their behavior resulted in the outcome?  Absolutely.  If they hadn\u2019t done something, the bad thing wouldn\u2019t occur?  Absolutely. Deserves in my mind equates to malicious intent.  \n\nFor me, the core question is:  is this truly a one-off comment or does mom have a habit of often making \u201cone-time\u201d hurtful comments?  If it is habit, deserves.", "If someone throws you the ball, you don't have to catch it.", "This was grandma's first fup sounds like. She used poor words. Removing her completely just says people who make mistakes/poor choices don't deserve grace and get expelled from the family. Not a great example of how to treat people we love. \n\nI come from an absolutely toxic family. Breaking the generational curses is HARD. Sarcastic just joking bullshit. I spend a lot of time getring down on the kids level and apologizing for harsh words or yelling. It's much less than it was and that's a good thing.", "You sound like a cool mom! Bless you", "Oh, mine can also be emotionally distant, too.\n\nThey each are a whole packet of dysfunction. I really should have begun therapy a few decades ago.", "So you would allow grandma, who told Lucas that he isn't really her grandchild because he isn't blood related, to see that boy again? It was much worse than just using poor words. She inflicted a considerable amount of emotional hurt on a 5 year old boy over nothing.", "Thank you. My son keeps telling me and that if other kids ((that aren't actually mine) are calling me Mom, I have to be, but it's hard to believe at times! I often feel like I could/should be doing more.", "She did not say this directly to Lucas. She said a thought outloud in his presence. Yes it was hurtful, yes it was not OK. \n\nRead my last response. Buy ejecting grandma all they are teaching Lucas is that mistakes get you ejected from the family. No grace no forgiveness.  So don't make a mistake because then dad won't love you anymore.", "I think most moms feel that way sometimes. Sounds to me like you're doing a great job!"]}
