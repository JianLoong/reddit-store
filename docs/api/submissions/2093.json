I assume it's your brother, since Mum claims genetic relation to them. What would she have done if it had been the husband?

The daughter I (40f) am raising with my wife is eight years old now, and it feels like every step of the way you're under so much scrutiny! Everyone's eager to see if your kid turns out broken or wierd because their parents are the same gender. You get used to filling in forms by crossing out where, (in our case), it says 'father'. You get used to people asking \"Which one of you is mum?\" or \"Who's the 'real' mum? The one who gave birth?\" The weird looks when you're out as a family. The occasional rant from an opinionated stranger. You *never* get used to it coming from family. Our daughter is biologically ours, (Yes, we are both her bio parents, all I will say about it is 'Yay, science'!), so we don't get that problem, but my mum still occasionally drops a hint or two that our daughter 'deserves' a father figure.

I'm throwing in a different opinion here: kindly, YTA.\n\nShe made a mistake, by being very insensitive to Lucas. She genuinely apologized and made the effort to correct it.  It sounds like she has and is in a positive relationship with Lucas and as you said has been a terrific grandmother. This is the makings of a positive person in Lucases life.  It is both AH move to the grandmother AND to Lucas to choose to discontinue their positive relationship, by framing the grandmother's mistake as toxic behavior, and implying it is a toxic belief.\n\nIt is my personal experience and opinion, speaking as an adoptee with a very explored experience, and who immersed deeply in dialogues within the adult adoptee community, that on the contrary, it is actually VERY UNHEALTHY and TOXIC to NOT acknowledge the differences and natural tendencies between bio & not bio, in adoption.  People's sentiments and physiological body responses to bio kin are normal, instinctual, and human, they are also not necessarily mutually exclusive to having an inclusive loving family that supports and loves someone of a different origin nor are they necessarily indicators of prejudice.\n\nLucas will not get that special bio-connection by being adopted. That is one of the losses that factor into the complex situation that is adoption. It is important to be educated on the immense amount of grief of losing that and it is important to acknowledge that is a very very real loss....it is important to be considerate when navigating when bios and adoptees are mixing: This means not saying things in front of him that rub it in his face aka that he lost/cannot have this basic thing most everyone else around him has ....BUT IT ALSO MEANS not endorsing a narrative that pretends like the instinctual way people refer and interact to bio kin, is a toxic behavior, as opposed to a very normal occurrence you can see literally everywhere in subtle expressions throughout society and families everywhere you turn.  By framing the grandmother's admission to feeling something different when holding a bio,  as toxic, you are all bypassing the real issue, and creating the framework to disenfranchise the grief.  If you frame grandmother as wrong for feeling the way she does about her bio kin, you are implying that the difference doesn't or shouldn't exist, you are setting the stage to have your adoptee grieving alone because they will be grieving something you are telling them doesn't or shouldn't exist. I guarantee you that either consciously or unconsciously the adoptee is picking up in the micro-expressions and mirroring of bio connections families all around them have that are not present in his own family, beyond the grandmother. It does the adoptee a disservice to pretend it's not there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedited for clarity", "NTA\n\nI don't get that mindset.
