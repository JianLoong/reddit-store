She got somewhere in the low 1300s, and I know that this is still not a bad score at all. But she worked very hard for the test and was really disappointed with her score.

I said let me check quickly if anything else is happening tomorrow, and I asked Emily if her grandma can come over to celebrate their results. Emily said that was fine, so I told my MIL she could come. \n\nMy husband was at work when she came over. She brought a box of cookies and gave it to Laura, saying she was proud. Emily was standing there too and looked hurt. I asked if she had brought anything for Emily. She laughed a little and said not this time, but she\u2019ll make even better cookies when Emily does her resit. (No one told her she was resitting, my MIL just assumed.) Emily went upstairs and I think she was crying. So I told my MIL very sharply that she can take her damn cookies and get out. She was shocked and angry but she left.

Now your husband and Laura have internalized her favoritism to the extent that they can't see it for what it is and do not appreciate the damage that has been done. \n\nYou need to have a talk with your husband where you ask him why he's okay with it and make it clear that you will not tolerate it any more.   Tell him you want him to stop enabling his mom's favoritism with the extra attention in phone calls etc and backhanded slaps at Emily.   Do not expect it to be resolved with a one time discussion, you will have to be firm and call him out every time his mother steps out.\n\nAs far as Laura is concerned, sit her down and ask why she is so anxious for her grandmother's love that she would treat her sister badly.  Say it just that way, ask what exactly her grandmother has done and why she doesn't do anything for Emily.\n\nThis is not the time to be subtle with either your husband or Laura, you have to shut this down now.", "I think you should sit your kids down together and separately and explain \u2026  \n\n1) Grandmas favoritism is not ok. Someone who does better at school is not \u201cbetter\u201d as a person;\n\n2) explain to both Laura and Emily that someone may simply do better at school but this does not in any way mean that they will be more or less successful in life\n\n3) explain to Laura how Grandma\u2019s actions make Emily feel.  Also explain to Emily that Laura can and should be proud of her achievements. And that lastly, if Emily worked really hard, that is all you can ask for.\n\nBuy both your daughters cookies.\n\nNTA.", "Edit: NTA.  \n\nNot for this post's subject. You stood up for Emily against her cruel grandmother.  Laura is angry because she demands her golden child status. Both grandmother and Laura  told Emily, loud and clear, that she is not good enough.\n\nBUT you have been silent all these years, letting your MIL dimish and degrade Emily.  She spent her entire life knowing, not thinking, knowing that she is less than ger sister. At this point, you can't Undo this.  No matter what she accomplishes, she will always feel less than.\n\nBoth you and your husband are solely responsible for this.  It's not about what her grandmother did to her.  It's about what her parents allowed her grandmother to do to her.  Being mistreated is painful. Being mistreated while your parents sit silently by is devastating.", "\"She won\u2019t show it very obviously, but in little ways.\" I beg to differ. The woman displays her favouritism very clearly. Ask Laura how she would feel if she were treated so unfairly. Explain to husband that he should be defending Emily as well as you. You were more polite than I would have been. I would have told her where to stick her miserable biscuits. NTA", "Isn't a 1600 a perfect score for the SAT's?  Scoring a 1300 isn't anything to sneeze at.   My kid is a senior and didn't score anything even close to that.  But, we were proud of him for trying his best and he plans on retaking it next month. \n\nCongratulations to your girls.

I feel bad for Emily.", "Good vibes to Emily, who\u2019s being reduced to a test number.", "NTA but also YTA \n\n18 is pretty late in the twins life to put your foot down about this behaviour. \n\nCould have been nipped-in-the-bud longer than a decade ago, before it starts to affect them both throughout adulthood. \n\nAlso you need to encourage these girls to start living their own lives, just as siblings should. \n\nStop comparing them, sit them both down together and explain very plainly that they are not in competition with each other and need to stop comparing and to focus on their own lives and interests. \n\nIf they are still sharing a room, clothes, hobbies etc, separate them. \n\nDon\u2019t encourage them to attend the same Uni/ college whatever you call it. \n\nI am a twin to a boy who is much more academically talented than me, I ended up going to uni 3 years later due to crippling insecurity about my abilities (I also left school with average grades). \n\nIt wasn\u2019t family that caused this (my mum is a twin) it was the teachers at school and the best thing my mum did was complain and requested that they split us up in the final two years. \n\nWe also went to different colleges/ sixth forms. \n\nJust be mindful that this could happen to your girls and that they may not get along in the future because they are too enmeshed and competitive. \n\nLuckily, me and my brother have a great relationship but we are both insightful enough to ignore the twin-freak comparison nonsense that others project onto us (non-twins usually) \n\nWider reading and speaking to other twin parents could have prevented this problem 10 years ago.", "NTA, but you really need to have a talk with everyone about it now. First, talk with Emily to see how she is feeling. Favoritism is never easy to deal with when you\u2019re not the favorite, and feeling like you\u2019re not good enough is also not easy. Check in with her frequently. Second, sit down and talk with your MIL about this particular incident and how her favoritism has been hurtful to Emily. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t mean to show favoritism, so hopefully, if you point it out, she will recognize it and begin to change. (Again, I hope this occurs, although a lot of times, they\u2019ll turn it around on you.) Finally, sit down and talk with your husband and other daughter. Explain to them your perspective, and stay strong with your conviction. You are right here!\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with this the majority of my life. I was the favorite of my grandmother all growing up. I never saw anything wrong with it as a kid, but as an adult, I could see how it hurt my sister. I wish someone had explained it all to me before. Conversely, my niece was the favorite of my mother, and my kids were by far and away the lessers. It was so painful to watch it happen, and if I spoke up, my mother and sister somehow made it feel like it was my fault! My mother has passed away, and I\u2019ve gotten over it, and now I just realize that she missed out on knowing my kids, who are two wonderful people. I try my hardest not to have favorites, as I have seen first hand the damage it does. Good on you for taking a stand!", "Info- is this the first time you actually stood up to get about the favoritism?", "ESH. I mean especially MIL but it\u2019s clear you also favor Laura and the only person here who isn\u2019t an AH is Emily. Low 1300s is empirically a great SAT score!", "NTA present / soft YTA past\n\nSounds to be like this was just the straw that broke the mama's back.\n\nGrandma has been playing favorites for way too long and allowed to get away with it. While I don't disagree with comments saying this never should have been allowed to go on as it did, we have all suffered through things in the name of keeping the family peace - especially with in-laws. Your husband should have stepped in long ago, as people are more likely to make peace with their own children after being criticized than their children's spouses (who are often then blamed for ALL the drama that follows). But he didn't.\n\nGrandma can be mad all she wants - she plays favorites, and that is an AH move. \n\nHubby can be mad all he wants - he *let* his mother treat his daughter this way for years. He wasn't there to see Emily in obvious emotional pain when this particular event happened. Yes, you allowed it to happen in the past too - but your reaction to this instance shows growth. \n\nLaura can be mad all she wants - she comes across in this post as a spoiled \"golden child\" and a lousy sister. As sisters who couldn't be closer in age, there is an enormous chasm between them emotionally as Laura has been conditioned to believe that she is entitled to preferential treatment/status.\n\nYou should be mad. One of your children has been wronged. \n\nThe only person whose anger and hurt really matters, though, is Emily. It sounds like her entire life, she has been hurt and/or let down by those who should love her most, and *nobody* had her back - until now. Keep it up. Don't let grandma fool you into thinking her favoritism was *ever* acceptable.", "NTA.  This is so awful.  What a horrible grandmother.  For the record, Laura did great, but as a college professor, I assure you Emily has nothing to be ashamed of.  Her score might not get her into Harvard, but screw that, I\u2019ve had straight A college students who didn\u2019t get that SAT score.", "I'm sure I'll get voted down on this one, but YTA. \n\nThis favoritism has been going on for years. You've noticed it, and Emily certainly has as well. She's been hurt by it, and you've continually let it go. \n\nSo much so that *you* did it again and allowed this incident to happen. MIL said she wanted to bring over cookies to celebrate *Laura*. That was *your* time to act. Why allow her to come over to celebrate one but not the other? Getting upset and calling her out when she did what she always does is fine and dandy, but could've and should've been avoided in the first place.", "First but a minor point: Did you ever speak to Grandma about this in general? If not, this is coming from no where to her. YTA. \n\nSecond and more importantly: No one told Grandma what Emily scored numerically. Just \u201calright\u201d. Why would Grandma come over to celebrate an unknown score or \u201calright\u201d? This is an unfair expectation. YTA.  \n\nThird: Grandma may be thinking the score was less than alright and that\u2019s why the actual score wasn\u2019t shared. She didn\u2019t pry. She probably was thinking Emily scored so badly no one disclosed it to her and so she probably has to resit for it. This is neutral at best because it\u2019s not your job to disclose. \n\nFourth: Per your writing, Grandma asked if she can come visit and celebrate Laura which you agreed upon. She didn\u2019t say anything about Emily. And you agreed to celebrating Laura explicitly. Then you switch expectations. YTA. \n\nFifth: Why are you punishing Laura and taking away her cookies? YTA. \n\nSixth and lastly: You asked Emily if it was okay for Grandma to come celebrate THEIR scores. But Grandma had asked to come celebrate LAURA\u2019s score. You created this problem. Also why didn\u2019t you ask Laura if it was okay for Grandma to come over? You\u2019re playing favorites and creating false expectations. YTA.\n\nEdit: grammar", "NTA\n\nI would tell mil to take her damn favoritism and stay the hell away until she can see both girls for the wonderful individuals they are. \n\nHusband needs to wake up and stop legitimizing his mother's selfishly appalling treatment of his child.

This IS YOUR JOB! \n\nLaura takes her cues from both of you.", "YTA for waiting 18 entire years to do something meaningful about this situation. Good on you for doing it now. You're not wrong for the events of this specific story.

Just have  talk about this and how it feels and  see if Laura can be her sister champion instead.", "Whether Emily is willong to put up with it or not is beside the point.\n\nY'all have managed to teach both of them that Emily should be making sacrifices for her sister's happiness. It's more than a little late to start standing up for her, and likely to just cause friction and earn her the ire of her dad and sister and grandma now. \n\nESH Except poor Emily.

You and your husband have allowed this treatment to go on for far too long. She favors Laura, and Emily, per your own post, notices all these \"little\" instances and doesn't have a good relationship with her grandmother as a result. Your husband obviously shares his mother's view on things, which even to a lessor degree means he's also going to favor Laura over Emily.  \n\nLaura is also an issue, which from the replies you've given to the post, the twins are not close. Laura's reply on the phone to her grandmother that she did alright was unkind and a little rude. Given Laura's intelligence I'm sure she's aware her grandmother treats her better than she treats Emily and seems to be relishing that to some degree. Laura should treat her sister better.  \n\nWhile you, your husband, and Laura are lowercase a--holes, your MIL is an all caps A--HOLE. From what your replies have explained, your MIL is very traditionally Asian with regards to grades equalling success later in life. There's nothing that can really be done seeing as your MIL equates loving someone and treating them well based only on academic achievements. Unfortunately that's not how the world works, given so many billionaires are either high school or college dropouts, and success in life is not only tethered to grades.   \n\nThe only person who isn't at fault here is Emily, who takes her sister's dismissiveness, you and your husband's apathy towards how your MIL treats her, and your MIL's unfavorable attitude/treatment because her test scores aren't as high.  \n\nJust a little research here tells me that Emily scored in the 87th percentile with a score of 1300. Your post said low 1300s, so if she hit 1340 that's the 90th percentile. Emily did very well on the SAT and she shouldn't be upset with her results. That score will get her into most colleges without issue. Make to reinforce this point with Emily, she worked hard and got a good score. Laura scored in the 99th percentile with her 1540, which is great, but perhaps she should be reminded she didn't get a perfect score and that she could also have done better. A little humbling goes a long way sometimes.", "YTA. \n\nWhy do you not like Emily?", "NTA Protect your children. Teach Laura that her sister is as important as she is and that anyone who diminishes one to  bolster the other isn't doing either of them any favors.

The results came back yesterday. One of my daughters \u201cLaura\u201d did very well, she got a 1540 and is very proud (as she should be!) Her sister \u201cEmily\u201d didn\u2019t do so well. She got somewhere in the low 1300s, and I know that this is still not a bad score at all. But she worked very hard for the test and was really disappointed with her score. She has always struggled more with schoolwork than her sister, who does better without having to try quite as hard. Not to minimize her effort. Laura does work hard as well, but it does come a bit easier for her. \n\nMy MIL has always favored Laura, mostly because she does better in school. She won\u2019t show it very obviously, but in little ways. For example she makes them a birthday cake most years and always writes Laura\u2019s name bigger and first. Emily resents this a bit but doesn\u2019t mind too much, as they rarely see their grandma. Only Laura regularly video calls her, with my husband. \n\nMy MIL called yesterday to ask the girls how they did. Emily said she didn\u2019t want to talk to her (she told me, not my MIL) so I only gave the phone to Laura. Laura said her score and her grandma congratulated her excitedly. My MIL then asked Laura how Emily did. Laura said Emily did \u201calright\u201d. When I got the phone back my MIL asked if she could come visit tomorrow to congratulate Laura.

I did the work, but it was easy. It\u2019s likely Emily is working much harder to get the grades she gets than Laura is, because it probably comes easily to Laura.\n\nSome of us have brains that test well or that the people who made the test and decided what and how X and X and X are taught in school is the way to measure intelligence, and they are definitely not a measure of how successful people will be in life.\n\nThere are all kinds of intelligence.

Siblings can be very different people and still be close....unless you have a joyless old bat building on child up and tearing the other down. All Emily sees is her sister cheerleading her grandmother's mistreatment of her. Does Laura actually give a damn about her relationship with Emily? Because if she keeps it up, Emily will cut her off, and Laura can bask in grandma's attention all she likes. \n\n2.) His mother's favouritism is poisoning his relationship with Emily. Whilst Laura is loudly cheerleading, he is also happily telling Emily that she isn't good enough. She is doing her level best, and he thinks she should be doing more. Does he want her to burn out? Does he want her to work herself until she's nothing but a husk? Does he want her to push herself until she breaks just so she can earn his bullshit approval which is based on her scoring the 'right' number on a test? Does he want to lose his daughter? Because he will. He is breaking his daughter's heart and allowing his mother to do the same. \n\n3.) You've been complicit in his mother's mistreatment. You will also lose your child. Even now, you're making excuses about Asian families. Guess what? Ethnicity doesn't excuse the mistreatment of a child, not ever. Families are meant to break cycles, to do better for each generation, not push the same bullshit stereotypes that lead to mistreatment and abuse. \n\n4.) Emily deserves better. She is a bright, creative young lady who works damn hard. She deserves to be cheered on by her family and celebrated for her successes BECAUSE she works so hard for them. What she does not deserve is to be told by her grandmother, her father, her sister and tacitly by her mother that she is not good enough, that her efforts are not enough, and that she is a failure because she doesn't meet some arbitrarily-set level of academic achievement. Ask your husband and Laura how they would feel if that was the constant message they got. Ask them why they've decided that Emily isn't worth protecting and supporting and why they are so happy to allow her mistreatment. Ask them why that miserable woman's approval is more important to them than Emily's happiness and mental health. And finally, ask yourself why you've been so willing to sit back and allow this for so long. The grandmother did what she did because she's used to you not stepping up for Emily; she got this brazen because she's used to there being no consequences. \n\nYou all keep this up, and Emily will leave you all behind. She will have to in order to protect her mental health. If you refuse to treat her like family and protect and support her, why would she want to stick around? Family stands together and loves and supports each other, and if you cannot offer that, then she will find people who will. So it's make your mind time up for you all, because it's getting close to time for Emily to fly the nest, and if you all don't start doing better, she may decide not to come back again.", "My word, same here!

When MIL asked if she could come celebrate Laura\u2019s achievement, you should have caught that and clarified that she could come if she celebrated *both* of them.\n\n2. I\u2019m curious: is Laura allowed to celebrate her achievements even if they\u2019re greater than Emily\u2019s? It shouldn\u2019t be done in a way that puts down Laura (as was the case here), but I hope you\u2019re not making Laura feel like she can\u2019t be proud of herself unless Emily is also proud. That\u2019s not going to be good for Emily, either; she\u2019ll either develop a sense that everyone should tailor their lives around protecting her feelings, or she\u2019ll feel worse about herself because she\u2019ll see it as everyone putting her. \n\n3. Did you still celebrate, just in a more mutual way? Completing the SAT is a milestone regardless of your score. I worry that Emily is never getting to celebrate her achievements either because they\u2019re less than her sister\u2019s, and Laura isnt getting to celebrate for fear of putting down her sister. It would be much better to help Emily be proud of what she did accomplish rather than always feeling like if someone outperformed her, then she didn\u2019t accomplish anything at all.\n\n4. Tell your husband that if he doesn\u2019t trust your judgment on how and when to set boundaries with his family, then he needs to be present whenever you deal with his family. I still worry that he wouldn\u2019t stand up for Emily if he were there, but I\u2019m especially concerned that you\u2019re stuck in this dynamic where if he\u2019s not there you\u2019re not allowed to make the necessary decisions.\n\n5. Please explain to Laura that you\u2019re not stopping her grandmother from celebrating her, you\u2019re stopping her from *only* celebrating her. Explain to her that both she and Emily accomplished something big, and unless they\u2019d gotten identical scores, one of them was going to outperform the other. Ask her how she\u2019d feel if she\u2019d gotten the score she did but Emily had done even better, and MIL only brought cookies for Emily? What if society praised hard work more than achievement, and MIL had only brought cookies for Emily because she put more time and effort into preparing?? You\u2019re thrilled that your MIL wants to celebrate her, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay to stand right in front of someone who also just achieved something significant and be snide about their accomplishment. You don\u2019t praise one grandchild by putting down the other, and that\u2019s effectively what MIL tried to do.  \n\n4. Just a thought that it may be late for you to put into practice, but for anyone else reading\u2026 If you know one child outperforms the other in something, *especially* with twins but with all siblings, try to separate those things as much as possible. For example, schedule them to take the SAT on different days (there are so many dates available!) so that each gets their own celebration without such direct comparisons. With violin students, I actually encourage parents to have kids on different instruments to avoid this challenge; I taught violin to twins and one was better at the motor skill and memorization, so she advanced through new songs faster, but her brother was better at playing by ear. With both of them playing violin, they couldn\u2019t help comparing themselves to one another, and the boy got deeply discouraged because his sister\u2019s skills were easier to teach (counting number of new songs); he was SO much happier when he switched to piano and the comparisons stopped. I hope your  daughters each have some extracurricular or passion that\u2019s entirely their own, so they have areas where they don\u2019t need to be compared to one another.", "YTA, Emily was not happy with her score and Laura was.  The grandma knew that and is closer to Laura.  It's no surprise because Laura takes the time to talk with her.  Why can't the grandma state the truth and support Laura's accomplishment?  \n\nYou can't baby Emily forever.  There are always people that will be better at something than you are.

One of their cousins does all the time. That\u2019s how it happens sometimes.  It is far more likely my mother would celebrate something that the cousin did.  She has no idea what my kids accomplish because they do not tell her and I do not share their business for them.  It\u2019s possible ESH.  Probable even.

You stood up for your daughter, Emily. MIL is TA. Your husband is being shitty.\n\nHave you and your husband talked about how his mother treats your daughters differently? Seriously, the bias has been clear for a long time, so either your husband is okay with the mistreatment of Emily or he isn't. He needs to pick sides. Once you both are in agreement, then you both need to talk to your MIL about favoritism and her mistreatment of Emily. \n\nTalk to Laura though, she did earn the gift, but not at the expense of her sister. Do something nice for her to make up for the lost cookies. And do something nice for Emily also.\n\nOne thing to be clear about, Emily's score is still good. Laura's is near the top, but many students would be happy to be in the 1300s. Around 1000 is the average score, so both girls are well above that. And yes, do encourage Emily to retest, working with her on areas that she felt challenged by. Remind her that anyone can have a bad day, so the point of retesting is to show how good she is.  Just for reference I took my SATs a long while ago and didn't think that I did that well, mine was in the mid-1400s, but I hung out with really bright kids and several had perfect 1600s.

It's honestly extremely weird that you MIL would ask if she could come by for Laura and your first instinct is to gain permission from your other child. \n\nSo to recap. MIL asked if she could come congratulate LAURA because everyone was vague when she specifically asked. You changed that message to Emily that it was to congratulate THEIR results when that isn't what MIL asked and she was given every indication that there wasn't anything to congratulate.

Emily wouldn't talk to her on the phone,  which is fine,  but it sounds like grandma didn't even have the specifics of Emily's score anyway.  Were the cookies ONLY intended for laura or just handed to her because she was the one willing to visit with grandma? \n\nYou should be transparent with grandma about how Emily feels but something like the cake may not be intentional.  Every couple and every set of kids I know are a certain \"order\" in my head.  If you point it out and it continues,  you have more grounds for being upset.  \n\nIn this case I would've asked why she assumed Emily meant to resit the test. If it's just an assumption,  just tell her Emily isn't resitting at this point,  is a little bummed about her score,  and now she has her feelings hurt.  Give grandma the opportunity to talk to her before shoving her out the door. \n\nAlso,  Emily pouting because her score isn't high enough should not put a damper on celebrating her sister's score.

It's all just so obviously wrong. \n\nHowever, I think you are also in the wrong because you are basically punishing Laura for her MIL's poor decision. \n\nI think Laura is also in the wrong simply because she seems to not even notice or care that her sister is clearly being treated differently, nor that it hurts her sister. And if she does know...she might not care. \n\nI think you need to have a conversation with your MIL about treating both girls more equally, if she can't then you don't feel it's good to have her around when Emily is feeling so left out and dejected from her grandmother. \n\nThough I do think you also need to speak to Laura about how you are sorry about having caused an issue around her celebration \\[because you had agreed afterall to the celebration even though MIL said Laura is the one she was celebrating\\], but to perhaps have her try to understand that what grandma is doing, treating her more favorably, is also not kindness.

I allowed my DIL to bring the baby to work and I got to strongly bond with him in those first weeks. (DIL had little sick leave and her job was very physical. She had to take some unpaid leave and I was happy to help her maintain her income).\n\nBecause of our closer relationship, I offered to watch my grandson (who was mildly autistic) more often than my son's other kids.

It was very painful when I realized how much hurt I had caused.\n\nI took extra care after that to create one on one time with each of the other kids and changed the way I would extend invitations.\n\nI know this makes me look like an idiot, but that's how it really happened.

That made it easier to see those kids and I made a real effort to give both one on one and group time. Our relationships have improved greatly over time. \n\nMy DIL #1 always allowed me to have as much time with grandson #1 as I like, once he moved back home with his mom.

For me that meant grades didn't mean much. I passed and that's all I wanted. \nThere was a girl in my class I was kinda friends with who didn't really do well in school. She did however learn hard. One day after a math exam she worked hard for, she cried at the results. She got a D. She knew I didn't learn at all and got an A and she thought this was unfair. So my teacher told the whole class that her D meant way more than my A because I did nothing for it and she gave her best. I agree with that.

I think you are having two main problems here:\n\n1) By being silent, you are cooperating in validating your MIL's value system, in which Emily is worth less than Laura.\n\n2) It sounds like Laura has also imbibed this value system and is somewhat lording it over Emily in Emily's own home. \n\nI think the major change you need to make is that you need a new and better philosophy of \"what is a person worth\" and you need to ensure your children know that's your philosophy. Grades and test scores do not make a person worth more, in terms of their intrinsic worth. They may affect the person's \"worth\" in the job market, but your job is not a measure of your true worth. In fact, no gift that you are born with, truly governs your intrinsic worth. The gifts you are born with, your talents, IQ, physical attractiveness, height, glossy black hair, family wealth, etc, those are things you are given that you don't control. It's what you DO with your gifts that is important, whether society acknowledges that with material success, or not. And, for any individual person, you don't know how much of their outcome is things they didn't control, vs how much is in their power, because everyone's path through life is different. So the best thing to do is to just say: do your best, value yourself no matter the outcome, and if you make a mistake, redirect and try again. \n\nLaura and Emily both worked hard to prep for their SATs. So Laura's claim that she EARNED grandma's cookies (which in this context means status rewards) is incorrect. Rather, Laura benefitted from fitting into grandma's toxic view of a person's intrinsic worth. \n\nI would say the second change you need to make is to ensure that no child is mistreated in your home, even by another child. So I would be redirecting Laura here, to stop lording it over Emily and acting like Emily is lesser because she has a lower SAT score. How discouraging for Emily to be treated that way by her sibling. Maybe Laura could learn some empathy here. \n\nAlso, 1300s is a good SAT score range. Good grief, your relatives are snobby much?", "What you do is make it clear to both kids that while achievements are things to celebrate, the most important things is who you are as a person and standing up for the right thing.\n\nBtw - I wouldn\u2019t give back the cookies, I would have told your other daughter to take half up to her sister and tell her that she should get to celebrate too, because she also earned it.

It happens before they realize it, or they mistakenly believe that because the person they treat lesser doesn\u2019t speak up, they think they don\u2019t care. I believe in thinking the best of people, so based on that and my own experience, I truly don\u2019t think the MIL is setting out to treat the other child as lesser. Do I think she will respond well to be told this? No, because no one wants to think badly of themselves. It\u2019s hard to have a mirror shown back on you. I do hope that she will reflect on this, though, and that she will actively work on strengthening her relationship with the other girl.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like Grandma only values academic achievements to me.

The parenting emphasis should have been on them both completing a milestone and sharing the cookies that MIL brought, while teaching a continuing lesson about how we cannot control other people's ugliness, but can encourage equity in our own house.", "I don't think it's fair to say that Laura doesn't sound like a nice person simply based on this.

The 'child' breaks contact due to all the stress, and years later is an accomplished artist (with works in a gallery) or an author (with published writings) or an accountant (with a six-figure annual salary) etc etc etc. \n\nAnd when the 'child' posts to FB to say, \"Wow look at my holiday home! I wouldn't have it if I didn't [Follow my dream]\" you'll see the parents and other relatives queueing up in the replies, saying \"WE KNEW YOU COULD DO IT!

I just hope you know that it's nothing against you personally but rather against a situation that feels familiar to a lot of people. Putting pressure on a kid's achievement or favoritism between siblings is probably the most common violence children experience from their families.\nSo keep in mind while reading the comments that it is a very sensitive issue that will get people rilled up which leads to misunderstandings and miscommunications.\n\nThat being said to answer your comment : You need to have a serious talk with your husband about what he thinks would amount to enough work and are the results more important than the efforts put in to him. Because if his daughter didn't fail but it's not enough for him, what would be enough ? Ask him if she can ever be enough for him. Does he love her or does his love have to be bargained ? Because treating her differently than her sister just because she didn't do as good is love for sale and nobody needs that.\n\nAs long as your daughter succeed the score shouldn't matter. If she reaches HER objective it should be all that matters and should deserve as much praise as a full score.

Punishing her failures by emotionally attacking her, making her feel less than or less worthy of love isn't gonna make her perform better. On the contrary it will make her afraid of failure and could end up making her fail out of anxiety, depression and self-hatred. \n\nI would also have a talk with your other daughter, to explain the situation to her. If you don't she'll make her own conclusions which will be heavily influenced by the favoritism she received. Buy both your daughter ice cream or cookies or favorite anything and take the time to apologize to Laura about taking her cookies away but that as a mother you couldn't stand back and watch MIL mistreat her sister any longer. You never said anything because of [explain MIL background about coming to US and other relevant thinking you had] but this was too much, favoritism is one thing but contempt can't be forgiven. It wasn't right from the beginning and tell her you regret letting MIL put Laura above her sister as if succeeding in school was what determines someone's worth. Tell her you'd love her and her sister no matter what and it's wrong of MIL to force Emily to compete for love she never intended to give.

There\u2019s nothing about being Asian that\u2019s forcing this favoritism to happen.

Plus, a lot of kids have developed test anxiety because of all the standardized testing pressure in younger grades.\n\nThat alone can make testing so difficult.\n\nLater in life, I went to massage therapy school, and you have to pass a standardized test to be licensed. So many of my classmates were freaked out about that. \n\nAnd my school did some really cool lessons about learning style, about all the different kind of ways individuals learn, finding what works best for you and using it. I\u2019d never had a class like that in school. Granted, it was decades ago, but it seemed like we teach one way, and you should be able to learn that way, period.\n\nI figured out in college that for finals, going through all my class notes and reducing them down greatly to what I thought the most important points were, writing those down by hand and studying from those much smaller groups of notes helped me do so much better on finals.\n\nMy kid\u2019 school, from first grade, introduced the kids to a planner, to copying from the board information the teacher wrote on the board about assignments and test dates in their planner. Simply teaching them how to be organized is a great skill.\n\nTheir first grade teacher had them memorizing and reciting poems every week, which seemed odd at first, but she was teaching them to develop their memory, to figure out how they could best memorize things. Great skill for doing well in school."]}
