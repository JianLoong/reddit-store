She laughed a little and said not this time, but she\u2019ll make even better cookies when Emily does her resit. (No one told her she was resitting, my MIL just assumed.) Emily went upstairs and I think she was crying. So I told my MIL very sharply that she can take her damn cookies and get out. She was shocked and angry but she left.

Now your husband and Laura have internalized her favoritism to the extent that they can't see it for what it is and do not appreciate the damage that has been done. \n\nYou need to have a talk with your husband where you ask him why he's okay with it and make it clear that you will not tolerate it any more.   Tell him you want him to stop enabling his mom's favoritism with the extra attention in phone calls etc and backhanded slaps at Emily.   Do not expect it to be resolved with a one time discussion, you will have to be firm and call him out every time his mother steps out.\n\nAs far as Laura is concerned, sit her down and ask why she is so anxious for her grandmother's love that she would treat her sister badly.  Say it just that way, ask what exactly her grandmother has done and why she doesn't do anything for Emily.\n\nThis is not the time to be subtle with either your husband or Laura, you have to shut this down now.", "I think you should sit your kids down together and separately and explain \u2026  \n\n1) Grandmas favoritism is not ok. Someone who does better at school is not \u201cbetter\u201d as a person;\n\n2) explain to both Laura and Emily that someone may simply do better at school but this does not in any way mean that they will be more or less successful in life\n\n3) explain to Laura how Grandma\u2019s actions make Emily feel.  Also explain to Emily that Laura can and should be proud of her achievements. And that lastly, if Emily worked really hard, that is all you can ask for.\n\nBuy both your daughters cookies.\n\nNTA.", "Edit: NTA.  \n\nNot for this post's subject. You stood up for Emily against her cruel grandmother.  Laura is angry because she demands her golden child status. Both grandmother and Laura  told Emily, loud and clear, that she is not good enough.\n\nBUT you have been silent all these years, letting your MIL dimish and degrade Emily.  Shesoent her entire life knowing, not thinking, knowing, that she is less than ger sister. At this point, you can't Undo this.  No matter what she accomplishes, she will always feel less than.\n\nBoth you and your husband are solely responsible for this.  It's not about what her grandmother did to her.  It's about what her parents allowed her grandmother to do to her.  Being mistreated is painful. Being mistreated while your parents sit silently by is devastating.", "\"She won\u2019t show it very obviously, but in little ways.\" I beg to differ. The woman displays her favouritism very clearly. Ask Laura how she would feel if she were treated so unfairly. Explain to husband that he should be defending Emily as well as you. You were more polite than I would have been. I would have told her where to stick her miserable biscuits. NTA", "Isn't a 1600 a perfect score for the SAT's?  Scoring a 1300 isn't anything to sneeze at.

I feel bad for Emily.", "Good vibes to Emily, who\u2019s being reduced to a test number.", "NTA but also YTA \n\n18 is pretty late in the twins life to put your foot down about this behaviour. \n\nCould have been nipped-in-the-bud longer than a decade ago, before it starts to affect them both throughout adulthood. \n\nAlso you need to encourage these girls to start living their own lives, just as siblings should. \n\nStop comparing them, sit them both down together and explain very plainly that they are not in competition with each other and need to stop comparing and to focus on their own lives and interests. \n\nIf they are still sharing a room, clothes, hobbies etc, separate them. \n\nDon\u2019t encourage them to attend the same Uni/ college whatever you call it. \n\nI am a twin to a boy who is much more academically talented than me, I ended up going to uni 3 years later due to crippling insecurity about my abilities (I also left school with average grades). \n\nIt wasn\u2019t family that caused this (my mum is a twin) it was the teachers at school and the best thing my mum did was complain and requested that they split us up in the final two years. \n\nWe also went to different colleges/ sixth forms. \n\nJust be mindful that this could happen to your girls and that they may not get along in the future because they are too enmeshed and competitive. \n\nLuckily, me and my brother have a great relationship but we are both insightful enough to ignore the twin-freak comparison nonsense that others project onto us (non-twins usually) \n\nWider reading and speaking to other twin parents could have prevented this problem 10 years ago.", "NTA, but you really need to have a talk with everyone about it now. First, talk with Emily to see how she is feeling. Favoritism is never easy to deal with when you\u2019re not the favorite, and feeling like you\u2019re not good enough is also not easy. Check in with her frequently. Second, sit down and talk with your MIL about this particular incident and how her favoritism has been hurtful to Emily. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t mean to show favoritism, so hopefully, if you point it out, she will recognize it and begin to change. (Again, I hope this occurs, although a lot of times, they\u2019ll turn it around on you.) Finally, sit down and talk with your husband and other daughter. Explain to them your perspective, and stay strong with your conviction. You are right here!\n\nI\u2019ve dealt with this the majority of my life. I was the favorite of my grandmother all growing up. I never saw anything wrong with it as a kid, but as an adult, I could see how it hurt my sister. I wish someone had explained it all to me before. Conversely, my niece was the favorite of my mother, and my kids were by far and away the lessers. It was so painful to watch it happen, and if I spoke up, my mother and sister somehow made it feel like it was my fault! My mother has passed away, and I\u2019ve gotten over it, and now I just realize that she missed out on knowing my kids, who are two wonderful people. I try my hardest not to have favorites, as I have seen first hand the damage it does. Good on you for taking a stand!", "Info- is this the first time you actually stood up to get about the favoritism?", "ESH. I mean especially MIL but it\u2019s clear you also favor Laura and the only person here who isn\u2019t an AH is Emily. Low 1300s is empirically a great SAT score!", "NTA present / soft YTA past\n\nSounds to be like this was just the straw that broke the mama's back.\n\nGrandma has been playing favorites for way too long and allowed to get away with it. While I don't disagree with comments saying this never should have been allowed to go on as it did, we have all suffered through things in the name of keeping the family peace - especially with in-laws. Your husband should have stepped in long ago, as people are more likely to make peace with their own children after being criticized than their children's spouses (who are often then blamed for ALL the drama that follows). But he didn't.\n\nGrandma can be mad all she wants - she plays favorites, and that is an AH move. \n\nHubby can be mad all he wants - he *let* his mother treat his daughter this way for years. He wasn't there to see Emily in obvious emotional pain when this particular event happened. Yes, you allowed it to happen in the past too - but your reaction to this instance shows growth. \n\nLaura can be mad all she wants - she comes across in this post as a spoiled \"golden child\" and a lousy sister. As sisters who couldn't be closer in age, there is an enormous chasm between them emotionally as Laura has been conditioned to believe that she is entitled to preferential treatment/status.\n\nYou should be mad. One of your children has been wronged. \n\nThe only person whose anger and hurt really matters, though, is Emily. It sounds like her entire life, she has been hurt and/or let down by those who should love her most, and *nobody* had her back - until now. Keep it up. Don't let grandma fool you into thinking her favoritism was *ever* acceptable.", "NTA.  This is so awful.  What a horrible grandmother.  For the record, Laura did great, but as a college professor, I assure you Emily has nothing to be ashamed of.  Her score might not get her into Harvard, but screw that, I\u2019ve had straight A college students who didn\u2019t get that SAT score.", "I'm sure I'll get voted down on this one, but YTA. \n\nThis favoritism has been going on for years. You've noticed it, and Emily certainly has as well. She's been hurt by it, and you've continually let it go. \n\nSo much so that *you* did it again and allowed this incident to happen. MIL said she wanted to bring over cookies to celebrate *Laura*. That was *your* time to act. Why allow her to come over to celebrate one but not the other? Getting upset and calling her out when she did what she always does is fine and dandy, but could've and should've been avoided in the first place.", "First but a minor point: Did you ever speak to Grandma about this in general? If not, this is coming from no where to her. YTA. \n\nSecond and more importantly: No own told Grandma what Emily scored numerically. Just \u201calright\u201d. Why would Grandma come over to I celebrate an unknown score? This is an unfair expectation. YTA.  \n\nThird: Grandma may be thinking the score was less than alright and that\u2019s why the actual score wasn\u2019t shared. She didn\u2019t pry. She probably was think Emily scored so badly no one disclosed it to her and so bad she probably has to resit for it. This is neutral because it\u2019s not her your job to disclose. This is neutral at best. \n\nFourth: Per your writing, Grandma asked if she can come visit and celebrate Laura which you agreed upon. She didn\u2019t say anything about Emily. And you agreed to celebrating Laura explicitly. Then you switch expectations. YTA. \n\nFifth: why are you punishing Laura and taking away her cookies? YTA. \n\nSixth and lastly: You asked Emily if it was okay for Grandma to come celebrate THEIR scores. But Grandma had asked to come celebrate Laura\u2019s score. You created this problem. Also why didn\u2019t you ask Laura if it was okay for Grandma to come over? You\u2019re playing favorites and creating false expectations. YTA.", "NTA\n\nI would tell mil to take her damn favoritism and stay the hell away until she can see both girls for the wonderful individuals they are. \n\nHusband needs to wake up and stop legitimizing his mother's selfishly appalling treatment of his child.

You and your husband have allowed this treatment to go on for far too long. She favors Laura, and Emily, per your own post, notices all these \"little\" instances and doesn't have a good relationship with her grandmother as a result. Your husband obviously shares his mother's view on things, which even to a lessor degree means he's also going to favor Laura over Emily.  \n\nLaura is also an issue, which from the replies you've given to the post, the twins are not close. Laura's reply on the phone to her grandmother that she did alright was unkind and a little rude. Given Laura's intelligence I'm sure she's aware her grandmother treats her better than she treats Emily and seems to be relishing that to some degree. Laura should treat her sister better.  \n\nWhile you, your husband, and Laura are lowercase a--holes, your MIL is an all caps A--HOLE. From what your replies have explained, your MIL is very traditionally Asian with regards to grades equalling success later in life. There's nothing that can really be done seeing as your MIL equates loving someone and treating them well based only on academic achievements. Unfortunately that's not how the world works, given so many billionaires are either high school or college dropouts, and success in life is not only tethered to grades.   \n\nThe only person who isn't at fault here is Emily, who takes her sister's dismissiveness, you and your husband's apathy towards how your MIL treats her, and your MIL's unfavorable attitude/treatment because her test scores aren't as high.  \n\nJust a little research here tells me that Emily scored in the 87th percentile with a score of 1300. Your post said low 1300s, so if she hit 1340 that's the 90th percentile. Emily did very well on the SAT and she shouldn't be upset with her results. That score will get her into most colleges without issue. Make to reinforce this point with Emily, she worked hard and got a good score. Laura scored in the 99th percentile with her 1540, which is great, but perhaps she should be reminded she didn't get a perfect score and that she could also have done better. A little humbling goes a long way sometimes.", "YTA. \n\nWhy do you not like Emily?", "NTA Protect your children. Teach Laura that her sister is as important as she is and that anyone who diminishes one to  bolster the other isn't doing either of them any favors.

She has always struggled more with schoolwork than her sister, who does better without having to try quite as hard. Not to minimize her effort. Laura does work hard as well, but it does come a bit easier for her. \n\nMy MIL has always favored Laura, mostly because she does better in school.

Emily resents this a bit but doesn\u2019t mind too much, as they rarely see their grandma. Only Laura regularly video calls her, with my husband. \n\nMy MIL called yesterday to ask the girls how they did. Emily said she didn\u2019t want to talk to her (she told me, not my MIL) so I only gave the phone to Laura. Laura said her score and her grandma congratulated her excitedly. My MIL then asked Laura how Emily did. Laura said Emily did \u201calright\u201d. When I got the phone back my MIL asked if she could come visit tomorrow to congratulate Laura. I said let me check quickly if anything else is happening tomorrow, and I asked Emily if her grandma can come over to celebrate their results.

Meanwhile, Emily\u2019s perseverance and imagination are going to take her far. MIL is gonna be bitter. NTA of course. Keep Emily safe and aware of her worth!", "This sounds like an amazing story.  But please delete this.  You don't want to put your child's story idea out into the world.  It's a unique concept and it doesn't benefit her for you to share it.", "It sounds like a great idea, and really interesting !\n\nI hope you can encourage her to continue writing.", "My goodness, that story sounds like such a blast! If I had kids I would buy it for them!", "That actually sounds incredibly interesting! I\u2019m an adult and I would likely read it. \n\nAdmittedly I\u2019ve never been good at school stuff either (public school here sucks), so I can kinda relate. Tell Emily to keep writing and Laura good luck, cause it sounds like she\u2019ll be on r/entitledpeople if she doesn\u2019t change soon.", "I hope this gets published because I really want to read it!", "MIL is a small minded woman who will be never be happy with Emily\u2019s choices!", "This sounds like an awesome story! Would totally read.  \n\n\nAs someone who both had top grades/SAT scores AND dreamed of being a writer, only one of those has actually mattered into adulthood. I was actually better at math, but had zero interest in a STEM career. Emily knows what she wants to do with her life and is already writing. And that's actually a HUGE thing at her age, to have that kind of direction and commitment.  \n\n\nI would see if there are any writing workshops or programs locally for Emily to get involved in. Being able to study the thing that you're actually interested in makes SUCH a difference. And knowing that she both has strengths and that you will support her pursuing them will mean the world to her.", "I would also like to point out another extremely valuable skill Emily has that people like her grandmother take for granted:\n\nShe knows *how to learn.*\n\nShe knows how to put practice and effort into learning a new skill from the ground up. She knows how have *patience.* Perseverance. How to learn from mistakes *and keep going.*\n\nLaura sounds like she\u2019s heading for the Prodigy Dilemma: she\u2019s so used to things just coming naturally to her that the moment she reaches college and something *doesn\u2019t,* she\u2019s going to break and give up rather than put her nose to the grindstone and keep trying. \n\nEmily deserves to be honored for her own skills, not her \u201cfailure\u201d to adhere to *Laura\u2019s* standard. \n\nHard-work, practice, dedication, and the mental stability to accept small failures in order to progress towards a larger goal are just as worthy of recognition, if not more so, than scoring highly on a test.", "I\u2019m one of those people who scored top 5% nationally on the \nSAT, an honors graduate from high school and college, and I want to say that it wasn\u2019t a matter of a lot of hard work on my part.\n\nIt came easily to me. I did the work, but it was easy. It\u2019s likely Emily is working much harder to get the grades she gets than Laura is, because it probably comes easily to Laura.\n\nSome of us have brains that test well or that the people who made the test and decided what and how X and X and X are taught in school is the way to measure intelligence, and they are definitely not a measure of how successful people will be in life.\n\nThere are all kinds of intelligence. I don\u2019t believe we know how to measure all the kinds of intelligence there are. We just believe we can measure X kind now, and it\u2019s not fair to all the kids who are smart in different ways.\n\nI will say I\u2019m grateful to the National Merit program because I was a kind of poor kid, who lived in a poor state which didn\u2019t have a great education program compared to other states and came from a family where no one had gone to college before. It seemed completely out of reach.\n\nBut being recognized by National Merit meant a whole lot of schools contacted me and claimed they wanted me at their school and told me about their scholarship programs. Which is what made me realize I could go to college.\n\nAnd for your daughter Laura, she will be inundated with mail from colleges all over trying to recruit her and encourage her to apply for scholarships. So, you should be prepared to handle that coming to Laura and probably not Emily and be ready to kick the MIL out again.", "Tale*", "They're useful as part of a larger picture, but shouldn't be the One Score to Judge Them All. The main advantage is that they're standardized - a 4.0 GPA from one school doesn't mean the same thing as a 4.0 from another school, but a 1350 on the SAT means the same thing everywhere. \n\nThey're also not intelligence tests; IQ tests capture a much broader set of capabilities. But like intelligence tests, college aptitude exam scores *are* correlated with socioeconomic status.", "Fairy (tale). Guess you got a lower verbal score.", "Rich coming from you.", "Ok let me know how I score here:\n1. you are white\n2. you are male\n3. you are college (university) educated\n4. you are aged between 45 and 55\n5. You earn high 5figures or low 6figures\n6. you have paid off your student loans\n bonus point\n7. you believe student loan forgiveness is bad, because you paid it off and why should someone else get help when you dont.\n\nyours sincerely, a 30something with unjudged intelligence who never sat an SAT", "Didn\u2019t know fairies had tails?\ud83d\ude02", "Source?", "Regardless of how you feel about different types of intelligence, the SAT is not an intelligence test or a knowledge test.", "Because of the context here. Normally if you have 2 grand-kids who just nailed their test, even if you only got one on the phone, and regardless of you having a better relationship with one, you celebrate both.\n\nAnd absolutely, bringing cookies for Laura is great, it's them being only for Laura that's a problem.", "I meant the question quite literally. Does he think she did her best? And apparently the answer is no, he doesn't think that.\nI feel sad for Emily.\n\nDo you think he would/could ever think she truly did everything she could and this is the highest score she could achieve?\nDo the two of you ever tell her you proud of her? Does she get praise?", "Your husband needs to understand a few important things. \n\n1.) His mother's favouritism has created tension in your daughters' relationships. Siblings can be very different people and still be close....unless you have a joyless old bat building on child up and tearing the other down. All Emily sees is her sister cheerleading her grandmother's mistreatment of her. Does Laura actually give a damn about her relationship with Emily? Because if she keeps it up, Emily will cut her off, and Laura can bask in grandma's attention all she likes. \n\n2.) His mother's favouritism is poisoning his relationship with Emily. Whilst Laura is loudly cheerleading, he is also happily telling Emily that she isn't good enough. She is doing her level best, and he thinks she should be doing more. Does he want her to burn out? Does he want her to work herself until she's nothing but a husk? Does he want her to push herself until she breaks just so she can earn his bullshit approval which is based on her scoring the 'right' number on a test? Does he want to lose his daughter? Because he will. He is breaking his daughter's heart and allowing his mother to do the same. \n\n3.) You've been complicit in his mother's mistreatment. You will also lose your child. Even now, you're making excuses about Asian families. Guess what? Ethnicity doesn't excuse the mistreatment of a child, not ever. Families are meant to break cycles, to do better for each generation, not push the same bullshit stereotypes that lead to mistreatment and abuse. \n\n4.) Emily deserves better. She is a bright, creative young lady who works damn hard. She deserves to be cheered on by her family and celebrated for her successes BECAUSE she works so hard for them. What she does not deserve is to be told by her grandmother, her father, her sister and tacitly by her mother that she is not good enough, that her efforts are not enough, and that she is a failure because she doesn't meet some arbitrarily-set level of academic achievement. Ask your husband and Laura how they would feel if that was the constant message they got. Ask them why they've decided that Emily isn't worth protecting and supporting and why they are so happy to allow her mistreatment. Ask them why that miserable woman's approval is more important to them than Emily's happiness and mental health. And finally, ask yourself why you've been so willing to sit back and allow this for so long. The grandmother did what she did because she's used to you not stepping up for Emily; she got this brazen because she's used to there being no consequences. \n\nYou all keep this up, and Emily will leave you all behind. She will have to in order to protect her mental health. If you refuse to treat her like family and protect and support her, why would she want to stick around? Family stands together and loves and supports each other, and if you cannot offer that, then she will find people who will. So it's make your mind time up for you all, because it's getting close to time for Emily to fly the nest, and if you all don't start doing better, she may decide not to come back again.", "My word, same here!  I would read the heck out of that book!", "I was national merit with a score in the 1300s. It's a terrific score! Yes, the 1560 was better, but the other was no slouch! The percentiles are on a curve.\n\nI agree, there are books written about various forms of intelligence. There is charisma/emotional intelligence that will serve folks much better. It's great to be smart, but better to have awesome people skills.", "\ud83d\ude0f love this correction.

They factor in many things in the enrollment process.\n\n>But like intelligence tests, college aptitude exam scores are correlated with socioeconomic status.\n\nWell yeah... That's to be expected. That doesn't invalidate the test.", "Guess the test is doing its job correctly.", "How so?", "Do you have an actual argument or ?", "I mean, you and I just disagree on that. In my family, Emily not sharing her scores with me means she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it/acknowledge it. I would respect that until she wants to discuss and celebrate or vent or whatever. \n\nAlso, no one told grandma Emily nailed her test. Laura said Emily did \u201calright\u201d and mom said nothing to grandma. If I was grandma, hearing that and then knowing that Emily didn\u2019t want to talk about it would confirm that she\u2019s not ready to acknowledge/discuss and that\u2019s okay.", "It is funny and ironical, especially in the given debate. Hence merits a highlight.", "Fairy tail? Are you talking about the anime because otherwise its fairy tale.", "Nope, just did a bit of profiling having watched too much Criminal Minds. How many did I score??", "It's not ironic at all. I never said I got a high score \ud83e\udd23", "Why is me mistyping something rich?", "3/7"]}
