I kind of feel bad but I don\u2019t\n\nI just want to start off by saying my boyfriend is a very nice guy and we have a great relationship. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were at my house over the weekend watching sports and a martial arts fight or something was on. I jokingly said they should let the girls from a heavier weight class fight the guys if they wanted to. He started going on and on about guys being so much stronger and even if a girl in a heavier weight class fought a smaller guy she would not have a chance . I\u2019m 5\u20194 and about 155 pounds. My boyfriend is a small guy, he\u2019s about an inch shorter than me and around 135 pounds. Jokingly I told him I bet he could not beat me at wrestling so we made a 100 dollar bet lol I have zero martial arts or wrestling experience. I have always been pretty strong for a girl. He said he wrestled in high school \n\nWe started wrestling and at first it was kind of even. He started getting really mad and really getting serious so I kind of got serious, And realized that I was a lot stronger than him. I pinned him down and he started struggling so bad to get up and I started laughing. I let him go and he tried to wrestle me again and I pinned him again!!!! He looked so distraught after but I could not keep a straight face. And now he owes me 100 bucks\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He thought women can't match men in fights, even at fair fights ie weight classes, and you proved him wrong.", "NTA but 20 pounds heavier is a different weight class lol", "Wait, a classic FAFO? \n\nDon't rub it in,  but if he doesn't get over it then you've got a different problem. \n\nRemind him that his pride should not be focused on competing with YOU. You're partners!!\n\nHelp him pick better battles where the two of you are together,  not at odds.\n\nNTA.", "Hahah NTA... Strength comes in all shapes and forms gotta watch what you say and to who ;)\n\nBut on the sports note he's probably not entirely wrong when it comes to pros. I've seen some mixed sex martial arts and in the same weight class experience seems to rank highest in terms of defining a win but I do believe lb per lb a guy is most likely to win. However would a female in a higher weigh class win... Maybe, but I dunno would be interesting to see.", "Nta. He asked for it.
