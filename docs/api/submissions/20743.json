I want to visit his grave and tell him how much I still love him and miss him.  \n\n\nI've told his friends and family that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of having a party like that, that it's way too soon for me.

You said you don't mind that they do it, just that you're not ready to party, which is totally valid.

It can all be a bit overwhelming, especially for someone so young.  However showing up did my heart good.\n\n I personally didn't stay long either. Saying my respect to his dad, mom, and feeling the love of his friends was good for my soul.  I did a big hello and a stealthy goodbye. \n\nIf you are debating how you could manage to attend.
