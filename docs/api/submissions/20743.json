I want to keep things simple and revisit some of our favorite places or do something we used to do together. I want to bake him his favorite cake, maybe look at some photos and light him a candle. I want to visit his grave and tell him how much I still love him and miss him.  \n\n\nI've told his friends and family that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of having a party like that, that it's way too soon for me.

You said you don't mind that they do it, just that you're not ready to party, which is totally valid.

The only ones being disrespectful are the ones insulting you for not wanting to go to a frat party dedicated to your deceased boyfriend", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have to participate.", "NTA at all! Everyone grieves differently, there\u2019s no right or wrong way, it\u2019s personal for everyone. You do what\u2019s best for you and what you\u2019re comfortable doing. I hate that it sounds like others are guilt tripping you, hope you can ignore it and focus on healing yourself and your heart. I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss!", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.  My boyfriend passed away 9 months ago.  I have found myself on a rollercoaster of grief since.\n\nIf you aren't ready to attend a birthday party, no one should try to force you or guilt you into attending.", "You know what YOU need to do.  That is have a quiet celebrations.\n\nThe grief is still very raw.  I can see how having a raucous party would seem inappropriate.\n\nPeople are putting pressure on you , but hold strong.\n\nIf you are being selfish, it is for your mental health.  You aren't ready for this.\n\nTo some, having a raucous party would seem disrespectful\n\nNTA\n\nI will also counter that the raucous party may turn into a wake, or some a celebration of life and give some sort of closure to those in attendance, similar to a funeral.  \n\nWe had a gathering of people two years after a person dies.  We were is a better state to share our stories of this person and happy to meet each other.", "OP, grief is super personal- everyone does it differently and in their own way.  You need to do what you feel is best for you.\n\nI'd thank the friends and say \"no thanks.\" then do the day the way you want to.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss.  NTA", "I would cut off any of them that call you selfish. They are the only ones being disrespectful.", "Poor OP must still be in shock \ud83d\ude22", "Exactly!!! \n\nNo one ever wants their partner to be sad, but loving partners would 100% understand and give the space and support their partner needs through such a difficult time.  \n\nSo the family saying manipulative bs like that arnt even respecting the wishes of the deceased - who very likely would want his friends and family to respect and support his grieving partner in the way she needs it.", "Telling OP they are selfish and disrespectful drives this into NTA territory.", "I think that's a bit harsh. It depends on the culture and the person what is disrespectful. In my culture, the funeral is a party to the life of the deceased. We laugh a lot and remember the joy the person brought. I prefer that personally, but understand that not everyone feels that way.\n\nIt was quite a shock for my then boyfriend when he came to my grandfather's funeral and instead of tears, toasts and funny anecdotes were told. He didn't know that from funerals.", "You must have no one in your life", "I would spew ectoplasm from one end of the room to another if my family did one of these for me.", "I told my wife, especially as I drive for a living, that if I ever died driving and she ever sets up a roadside shrine at the spot I bought it, I'd come back and haunt her. Those things are horrible.", "I think celebrating the birthday of someone you have lost is fine but respect that not everyone feels the same. Grief is subjective and people do it in their own way. If the op wants to mourn by visiting her boyfriend\u2019s grave and being alone, these AHs should let her.", "Jesus christ was that necessary?? ..people grieve differently and they have no right in telling OP how to grieve", "If they call me selfish for taking care of myself ONE MONTH after my partner died, then I'm better off alone", "My twin brothers who passed shortly after they were born. Every year (we just did the 40th bday dinner a couple of months ago) we do a family dinner, cake, and prayers. Nothing extravagant but a way to remember them, it's more of a way for my parents to process their grief (I was just over a year old when they were born and my other siblings were born after them so we didn't really know them).", "I mean, had his character just lost a life/turn?  Because I can see that being the reminder \u2026", "I told my youngest sibling something similar. I'm 12 years older than her so probability of me going first down the road is likely (in my early 40s and she just turned 30). I told her if she (or anyone) posted a photoshopped picture of me with angel wings or something to that effect I will be absolutely pissed in the afterlife if there is even such thing. I randomly mentioned it to her when we were visiting because I thought of people on FB posting stuff like that all the time. Major cringe.", "No. We were playing civilization 5. He hadn't lost a unit in hours \ud83d\ude02 just built a bunch of farms and was like \"oh yeah, best make sure my eldest kid is aware of what gets a haunting!\""]}
