He was in a coma for several weeks before he passed away from the injuries. He was my first love and soulmate and I'm still grieving and finding it hard to get through each day.\n\nHis birthday is next Friday and his friends and family are planning to give him a heavenly birthday party. My boyfriend was a happy and cheerful guy who loved to have fun and was very social with everyone, and so his friends want to throw a real college type party with loud music and drinks and dancing. I don't feel like I'm ready for that just yet, it's only been a month since his passing and it still feels like I haven't woken up from the nightmare. I\u2019m still not sure what\u2019s better, to be distracted or let myself sit in the sadness. All I know is that I want to spend the day alone. I want to keep things simple and revisit some of our favorite places or do something we used to do together. I want to bake him his favorite cake, maybe look at some photos and light him a candle. I want to visit his grave and tell him how much I still love him and miss him.\n\nI've told his friends and family that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of having a party like that, that it's way too soon for me. I' told them that they can have a party if they want, but that I won't be there. They argued that my boyfriend wouldn't want me to be sad all the time, that he\u2019d want me to have fun and throw him a big and noisy party, and that I'm just selfish and disrespectful.\n\nWIBTA for not going?\n\nE: just want to clarify that it's not a funeral or wake, but a birthday party in his honor. It just doesn't feel right to me. I've never been a party person and don't plan on starting now. Sure they can have a party if they want one, but I feel like I'm not ready for that kind of celebration. It's only been a month and people look at me like what\u2019s wrong with me and aren\u2019t I over it yet. I've tried to reason with his friends and explain that I need to grieve in my own way and in my own time, but they just don't seem to understand.", "created_utc": 1687886155, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kjkdq/wibta_if_i_dont_want_to_attend_to_my_boyfriends/", "score": 2152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am so sorry for your loss and after only a month you are still likely in shock and clearly in the throws of grief, which is totally normal. Grief is hard and milestones like birthdays or anniversaries make the loss that much harder. His friends are total assholes (yes I'm spelling it out because they suck) if they are giving you any kind of pushback for not going. You said you don't mind that they do it, just that you're not ready to party, which is totally valid.

If  it were to be having a big party to celebrate him, that would be fine, too.\n\nIts sounds like they want you to be back on your feet, but you're the only one who can make that happen.

Definitely NTA.", "Everyone deals with (these) situations differently his friends and family new him differently you had an intimate relation with him they didn't there the assh les for pressuring you its only been a month they should be more understanding.

You're just not ready yet, and that's okay. \n\nNTA.. they are, for not respecting the partner of their friend/family.

I think the key is \"I don't feel ready for that\". They can celebrate/grieve how you need to and they can do the same. \n\nIt's been a month. It's not like it was 10 years ago and you still haven't been able to come to terms with it. I'm a very extroverted/party type but a month after losing my partner, I would not be ready for something like that. Take your time. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSorry for your loss. But people grieve differently, and his friends and family should know the woman who loved him also misses him but to let her grieve on her own. It took my dad a full year and a half to get over the passing of our grandparents, who passed within 6 months of each other (grandma first at 75, grandpa later at 87). He struggled with depression, sleeping and most of all, the absence of two people who were good listeners and offered advice. But I never felt that he was overreacting. I allowed him to grieve by himself and made my own peace with their loss as I was closer to them than my older brother was.\n\nDo the things you want to do on his birthday. My condolences and I hope you find closure and happiness later in life.", "NTA what is wrong with people", "NTA.\n\nI am sorry for your loss.\n\nThe first rule of grieving is that everyone grieves differently.

Please look after yourself.", "NTA - NO one, and I mean *NO ONE* gets to dictate how you grieve, or for how long you grieve. **_NO ONE_**\n\nYou aren't telling them that you think their idea is wrong, or bad, or that they shouldn't do it. You are respecting how _they_ are choosing to grieve. You are just asking to have that same respect extended to you.", "Of course you're not the AH.

I think it\u2019s selfish for them not to understand how you feel. It\u2019s still so new for you and you can\u2019t celebrate him that way.

You are fine not to go.", "Ive celebrated my passed grandparents bdays by having a family dinner with their favorite food (miller lite, prime rib, and cheesecake for my grandma for example lol) and I can see why they decided to throw this party, I don\u2019t see it as creepy.

I just wanted to give the perspective that even though OP of course has every right to grieve in her own way, there are very different ways of dealing with grief and death and it is not necessarily disrespectful to celebrate rather than mourn the dead.", "NTA.\n\nI think it's great that his friends and family want to celebrate him like this, but that doesn't mean you have to.", "As a grieving step-dad, I can tell you, you are NOT the a-hole. Everyone processes grief differently and, barring extreme examples, you're entitled to grieve in the manner that works for you, as long as you're moving forward through it. A year is way too soon for this kind of fun event. I'm surprised the parents are joining in. \n\nMy wife and I joined Griefshare and it helped us immensely to meet weekly with people who had experienced similar trauma to talk and cry together. Good luck to you.", "NTA! My deepest condolences. Everyone deals with loss and grief differently. You need to do what you feel is right for you and your emotions.

Just keep on looking after yourself.", "NTA:  I got an email recently from a museum I have a membership with, saying that they know Father's Day can be a hard time for people who have lost their fathers, and offering me the option to opt out of all Father's Day promotional emails.  I thought it was such a thoughtful gesture.\n\nBirthdays of deceased loved ones can be very hard for the people left behind - especially those closest to them and very much so for the first few birthdays.  Having a celebration party for a recently passed friend might be a way for some people to cope, but regardless of what anyone tells OP, it is really just an unorthodox 'wake' and while some people like to have a celebration of their loved one's life and reconnect with family at a wake, there are also plenty of people who much prefer a somber and quiet reflection and rememberance ceremony.\n\nIf someone is thinking of planning a 'heavenly birthday party', they'd better be damn certain which kind of wake the departed's closest relatives are comfortable with.  If they were in anyway uncertain they should have talked to OP about it beforehand!", "NTA. Your bf knew your social habits, so being shamed into attending something that makes you uncomfortable and for which you're not ready to go to, is not something he'd want for you. What you planned sounds as if it is perfect. Places you loved together, sights you both cherished, remembering him in his quiet moments with you. That sounds like a lovely birthday idea, especially if you bake him a cake that you could feed to birds, ducks. I am so sorry for your loss.", "NAH \n\nN T A for how you choose to grieve. No one has the right to dictate someone else\u2019s grieving process. However, you are YTA for being a hypocrite. You cannot \u201callow\u201d your boyfriend\u2019s friends and family to have their party in his honour. They do not need your permission here. \n\nYou are getting mad at his family for judging how you grieve, while judging them for how they choose to grieve.

They want you to ignore YOUR grief for them.   \nIt tells you exactly what you mean to them, NOTHING!", "Grief is a deeply personal and individual experience, and it is important to recognize that everyone copes with it differently. Your desire to spend the day alone, engaging in personal rituals to honor your boyfriend's memory, is completely valid. It is essential for friends and family to respect your feelings and provide you with the space and understanding you need to grieve in your own way. It is unfair for them to label you as selfish or disrespectful for choosing not to attend the party. Remember that grieving takes time, and there is no right or wrong way to navigate through it. Take the time you need and allow yourself to process your emotions at your own pace.", "You are absolutely not an asshole. You grieve however and for however long you need to. Grief is not cookie cutter or one size fits all. Anyone saying otherwise is delusional. In my experience it comes in waves. The first few months can feel absolutely brutal and it will get easier eventually. But no one can snap their fingers and say \u201cok be over it now!\u201d That\u2019s simply unrealistic. I\u2019m terribly sorry for your loss OP. But don\u2019t worry what anyone else has to say. Let them have their birthday kegger.

Its nice that they gave you an invite, but its completely up to you to attend.   \n\n\nI had something similar occur when I was a teen. Its left a lasting mark even 20+ years later.

Telling somebody who is grieving that they are selfish because they don't want to grieve the same way you do or they can't, is absolutely disrespectful no matter what culture you come from, no matter what religion you practice, no matter who your family is or what your family traditions are, or even how you personally feel that people should grieve. \n\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong with having a different grieving process than somebody else, but to shame them for it is absolutely disrespectful, absolutely unnecessary, and no matter where you are from should not be tolerated.", "Yes and unfortunately you are still responsible and need to take the consequences of the things you say and do while you're grieving. People will be understanding, but it is not an excuse to get to stay or do whatever you want. Calling somebody's selfish because they grieve differently than you, is something that is very hard to forgive. Especially if you're grieving the same person.\nGrief does not justify or excuse words or actions. It can explain them, but you still have to own up to them and take responsibility for them. And if that means that the person you said something to no longer wants anything to do with you, then you need to accept that. If that means that the person you said something to wants to maintain distance for a while and go low contact, then you need to accept that. Because what you said hurt them. You don't get away with saying whatever you want just because you are grieving somebody who is dead. You still have to be somewhat tactful and mindful of how you treat others, especially those who are grieving as well.", "You know what I meant by that.", "While the parents response might be motivated by their own grief, it does not justify or excuse what they said. Calling somebody selfish because they're grieving process is differently than yours, is disrespectful no matter how you're feeling or what motivated you to say it.
