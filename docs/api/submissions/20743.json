He was in a coma for several weeks before he passed away from the injuries. He was my first love and soulmate and I'm still grieving and finding it hard to get through each day.  \n\n\nHis birthday is next Friday and his friends and family are planning to give him a heavenly birthday party. My boyfriend was a happy and cheerful guy who loved to have fun and was very social with everyone, and so his friends want to throw a real college type party with loud music and drinks and dancing. I don't feel like I'm ready for that just yet, it's only been a month since his passing and it still feels like I haven't woken up from the nightmare. I\u2019m still not sure what\u2019s better, to be distracted or let myself sit in the sadness. All I know is that I want to spend the day alone. I want to keep things simple and revisit some of our favorite places or do something we used to do together. I want to bake him his favorite cake, maybe look at some photos and light him a candle. I want to visit his grave and tell him how much I still love him and miss him.  \n\n\nI've told his friends and family that I don't feel comfortable with the idea of having a party like that, that it's way too soon for me. I' told them that they can have a party if they want, but that I won't be there. They argued that my boyfriend wouldn't want me to be sad all the time, that he\u2019d want me to have fun and throw him a big and noisy party, and that I'm just selfish and disrespectful.  \n\n\nWIBTA for not going?", "created_utc": 1687886155, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kjkdq/wibta_if_i_dont_want_to_attend_to_my_boyfriends/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am very sorry for your loss", "NTA at all!!!\n\nGrief is so personal, and yours is obviously very raw. \nI can't believe they called you selfish... AFTER A MONTH! I am so angry for you. \nA friend of mine lost her partner 10 years ago. She's since married and has a little girl, but every year on the anniversary of his death, she takes the day off and leaves her family and does exactly what you're planning to do. \nHer grief has eased but she still needs that time.\nI'm sorry for your loss.", "Very much NTA. I am so sorry for your loss and after only a month you are still likely in shock and clearly in the throws of grief, which is totally normal. Grief is hard and milestones like birthdays or anniversaries make the loss that much harder. His friends are total assholes (yes I'm spelling it out because they suck) if they are giving you any kind of pushback for not going. You said you don't mind that they do it, just that you're not ready to party, which is totally valid. The fact that they call you selfish because you don't want to party is unbelievably callous, horrible and gross. Do what you need to do to survive this hard time and fuck those jerks.", "NTA. Aside from the idea that a \u201cheavenly birthday party\u201d just sounds creepy, you are still grieving and having a party isn\u2019t something you want to do. Don\u2019t do it. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss", "NTA.  I'm so sorry for your loss.  It's only been a month.  Do what you feel is best for you.", "In traditional Jewish mourning rituals the mourner abstains from things like parties for 30 days; and in the cases of grieving a parent or similar it extends to a full year. I don't think ours is the only tradition with these long periods of grieving either\n\nObviously, that's not how everyone prefers to mourn and it's totally valid for his friends and loved ones to want to celebrate in a way they think is in alignment with his values... But it's just as valid for you to not want to partake\n\nAbsolutely YWNBTA. I'd say N A H here but them calling you selfish and trying to guilt you into going is pretty awful\n\nMay his memory be a blessing, it sounds like his life touched many", "You are definitely not the asshole. Sorry for your lost.\n\nEveryone has their own ways and timelines to deal with grief. Given you say it\u2019s only a month, it just so recent and it\u2019s understandable that all of this is so soon for you.\n\nWhat you had plans for his bday is perfect and you should stick to it.", "Not at all! Everyone grieves differently and you have the right to do what feels best for you just like they have the right to do what feels best for them. 4 weeks is not a lot of time and I don\u2019t blame you at all for not being up for a big rager.

If your boyfriend's friends and family want to celebrate his life with a party on his birthday, fine and fair. If you're not ready to partake in the celebration, that's fine as well.", "\n\nAbsolutely not. You have every right to grieve in a way that honors the life of your loved one, and that looks different for everyone. You should not feel obligated to take part in activities that do not feel right to you. You should also not be judged or feel pressure from others to express grief in a certain way. It's understandable that his family and friends view this as a way to lift his spirits and to come together in celebration, but there are many other ways to express grief and honor his memory, and if you don't want to attend the party, that is your prerogative.", "NTA\n\n\nWhat a situation... the cake idea sounds amazing.\nAnd visiting yalls hangout spots sounds great too.\n\nGet yourself some closure and peace.", "NTA. Do reconsider, though - this is an opportunity for the people who loved him to get together and share memories, not just to drink and dance and party, If you aren\u2019t at that stage, though, there is nothing wrong with that. Everyone grieves differently", "NTA. You need to take care of you. Arguing about what your BF would want is kind of cheap and pointless because (1) since he isn\u2019t here, anyone can claim anything they want about what he would say/want/do, and (2) you\u2019re the one that makes the decisions for your self care, and even if your BF were still around, that would not change.", "NTA. We all Handel grief differently and you clearly want to honor him in your own special way on his bday. Your family and friends are being A-holes for pressuring into something you\u2019re not ready for.", "First of all, so sorry for your loss.  NTA, everyone grieves differently, how you want to spend the day is your choice and you should do what you want to do, they can grieve how they want.  It always boggles my mind that people think you can get over a heavy loss like this in a matter of weeks or months and expect you to \"move on\" just like that.  Take time for yourself to heal and don't feel ashamed to go to counseling to help you through this.", "NTA. *NTA* \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your devastating loss. Much love. \n\nYou aren\u2019t at the stage of grieving where you can put on a party face yet.

This might be an unpopular opinion, but i think that funerals are for the living and not for the dead, and this birthday party is no different.

I don't think your family are consciously trying to manipulate you, but it's still a shitty thing to say even if it's common and (somehow) socially accepted.\n\nThem wanting to celebrate your bf by having a party in his memory is valid, and you preferring to grieve privately is also valid.\n\nNTA, would be NAH if not for the manipulation above.", "NTA. You simply respond \"Everyone grieves at different speeds and I'm just not ready for this type of celebration yet. Hopefully by next year I will be right there with you. I'm glad you guys are celebrating his birthday this way, because he would have loved it. I'm just not emotionally ready for it right now, so I'm going to remember him in a more quiet and personal way this year.\" And that's it. Don't engage further. You don't need to explain your grief to anyone. Just because his family may be ready to put away the sadness and celebrate his life, it is not fair for them to assume or expect you to be on the same timeline, and it's also not fair of them to try and guilt you into it by saying he wouldn't want you to be sad. You know yourself. If you're not ready for a big celebration, don't put yourself through that. Hugs xx", "That's become a trend. Both my parents have threatened to come back and haunt me if I ever do anything like that when they pass.

My mom at least made that threat/promise shortly after my grandma died, so death was already kinda on her mind. \n\nMy dad just looked over at me WHILE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES TOGETHER and was like \"hey, just so you know, if you ever post 'happy heavenly birthday' or anything like that on Facebook or whatever the heck it is by then, I'll come back and haunt you.\" Like ok dad, thanks for the warning?
