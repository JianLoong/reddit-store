Because if so, maybe he should try a little something called therapy. \n\nEither way, you two should definitely have a conversation about your boundaries. I don't necessarily think your bf is the AH, as being insecure is no fun. Still, relationships need trust to function. If you're trusting him to be your partner, to share your secrets, to care for you when you need it, to potentially spend the rest of your life with, he should at the very least trust you to not cheat on him. \n\nAlso, his constant paranoia and fear of your infidelity that you're describing is commonly found in cheating partners.

It will only get worse if you do. He has to want help to get over these feelings and do the work required to do so on his own.

Just to add a personal anecdote, I also once dated a man for a few months who was incredibly insecure and wanted to put all sorts of tracking apps on my technology. I was young(ish) and kind of na\u00efve still about healthy relationships and boundaries. Having the tracking apps did not help his insecurities it just gave him extra ammo to scream and throw fits about where I was at any given time. Do not be younger me, tbh I still have some trauma from that relationship despite it being over 10 years ago and one of the shortest relationships of my life.", "YWNBTA.
