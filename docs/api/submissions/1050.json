I'm basically a boring vanilla Christian who likes judging people (but secretly, which is why I'm on this sub in reddit lol). There's no reason the kids or parents would magically intuit that you're on OF or what your glorious jugs look like without going on OF to look at you. It's not like you're advertising your OF while you're there.\n\nI'm sure plenty of them do things in private that are not particularly godly. This is just hypocrisy.", "NAH.", "Being judgmental hypocrites is kind of the defining characteristic of Christianity.  You are NTA for being upset at what they did, but it also can't come as a surprise.", "NTA I'm wondering how these pious a-holes know about your OF? Just kidding. We know how they know.  Unfortunately for you, this is the sort of hypocritical judgement that you will sometimes have to deal with.", "NTA, but your sister is. \n\nThe petty party is here to play. \nI would request the school pays for the paint you\u2019ve already purchased. I would also ask who the person was because they are a sinner as well and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to corrupt the children. I would also make it a point to let them know their god would be ashamed since he kicked it with sex workers.", "NTA - everyone wants to watch porn but then they judge the people who make it!

NTA", "NAH\n\nThey are allowed to have their beliefs and standards.\n\nYou have different beliefs and standards.", "It is within the rights of a private religious school to choose who is around the kids.   That is the primary reason to have the school to begin with - parents have more influence on what is happening with their kids as opposed to a state-run school, and the value system matches their beliefs.\n\nThey don't agree with your lifestyle and so they acted accordingly.   The parents are the customers of the school, and their viewpoints trump yours because it is their kids, and they are paying for what they value (positive influences and role models for their kids).\n\nJust because you think it is fine to have an OF doesn't mean others will agree.   I guess they  think someone with an OF presence could potentially be a bad influence on their kids.   And they would be correct.\n\nIn case you are unaware, there are many employers who object to their employees being involved in anything related to the sex industry.

You obviously don't have to like that, but it is what it is - and your reaction just shows they made the right choice.", "NTA for telling them to fuck off. They asked you to leave an activity and you were offended. Being upset is a natural reaction. Whether they were being AH in deciding they didn\u2019t want someone who works in the sex industry participating in a PTA event is a different issue.

I'm all for all sex work.  Seriously.  However, every choice we make in life disqualifies certain paths.  Just as you have the right to have an OF (go queen) they have the right to no longer want your involvement.

That's your life choice and no one has to accept it.", "YTA, it\u2019s a Christian school, I\u2019m not surprised they don\u2019t want a cam girl helping out with their students. I\u2019d like to hear how exactly they told you that you were off the team, because I\u2019m assuming from what you wrote that they were cordial about it. While you\u2019re free to do what you want, people are free to judge you for your choices. You\u2019re not TA because you\u2019re a cam girl, you\u2019re TA because you cursed out the people that have what they believe to be their children\u2019s best interest at heart.", "NTA.

Sucks you had to use your own money and hopefully you can return the items..if it helps I would have also uninvited you had someone else approached the organizer's about it and they came to me about it. Too much focus on that vs the event at hand after that point. Better to just kick one person out than have the whole place worrying about someone else's business and taking focus off the kids! Which is the point of the event", "what's an OF?", "NTA, but if you are doing face painting, is it possible that they would make an exception if you painted your own face?

The biggest probable with these \"Christians \" is they didn't judge the perv who knew. Your better off staying away from these people.", "Its funny how those christians who talk about morals are the biggest hypocrites.
