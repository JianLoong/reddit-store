I'm basically a boring vanilla Christian who likes judging people (but secretly, which is why I'm on this sub in reddit lol). There's no reason the kids or parents would magically intuit that you're on OF or what your glorious jugs look like without going on OF to look at you. It's not like you're advertising your OF while you're there.\n\nI'm sure plenty of them do things in private that are not particularly godly.

That is the primary reason to have the school to begin with - parents have more influence on what is happening with their kids as opposed to a state-run school, and the value system matches their beliefs.\n\nThey don't agree with your lifestyle and so they acted accordingly.   The parents are the customers of the school, and their viewpoints trump yours because it is their kids, and they are paying for what they value (positive influences and role models for their kids).\n\nJust because you think it is fine to have an OF doesn't mean others will agree.   I guess they  think someone with an OF presence could potentially be a bad influence on their kids.

I'm all for all sex work.  Seriously.  However, every choice we make in life disqualifies certain paths.

You\u2019re not TA because you\u2019re a cam girl, you\u2019re TA because you cursed out the people that have what they believe to be their children\u2019s best interest at heart.", "NTA.

Sucks you had to use your own money and hopefully you can return the items..if it helps I would have also uninvited you had someone else approached the organizer's about it and they came to me about it. Too much focus on that vs the event at hand after that point. Better to just kick one person out than have the whole place worrying about someone else's business and taking focus off the kids! Which is the point of the event", "what's an OF?", "NTA, but if you are doing face painting, is it possible that they would make an exception if you painted your own face?

And the worst kind of Christians!", "So it\u2019s ok for parents to watch OF (or else they wouldn\u2019t know you had one), but not ok for you to help at this event? Yeah, that\u2019s nuts. Unless you were planning on making content there or handing out cards with your OF info on to literal children. Which, I\u2019m guessing you weren\u2019t planning to do, because you don\u2019t seem nuts.\n\nNTA\n\nDo you want to come and help at the pta at my daughter\u2019s school? Got a disco in two weeks and we\u2019re desperate for more help?", "They are ridiculous and way out of line. NTA", "Surprise benefit.", "Only Fans", "But no one seems to be judging the people that pay to view or interact with sex workers...", "Yeah! They are only ok with being associated with sex when it involves kids! What was OP thinking?!", ">\tand the value system matches their beliefs.\n\nUnfortunately neither are christian.\n\n>\tI guess they  think someone with an OF presence could potentially be a bad influence on their kids.   And they would be correct.\n\nThat\u2019s right, their kids could learn how to be selfless, help others with their own money and time, be generous and that\u2019s obviously against their hypocritical and condescending beliefs.\n\nThey\u2019re disgusting and you\u2019re obviously from the same mould. Let me guess: You\u2019re a \u201echristian\u201c.", "Only Fans. Basically like a cam girl", ">\tthat have what they believe to be their children\u2019s best interest at heart.\n\nBy teaching them the opposite of what christianity is about? NTA", "She wasn\u2019t asking people to accept it lmao wtf are you talking about", "I think you\u2019re probably right but somehow your comment rubs me the wrong way in that it pits women against each other all for some middle aged guy\u2019s attention/lust. It could actually just be that the sister let it slip and the rest of the PTA are genuinely morally against it.", "I agree OP was out of line. There is a tasteful way to handle religious and backwards pearl clutching and OP chose to act like she\u2019s sooo surprised Christians don\u2019t want a sex worker around their children. I don\u2019t personally respect OF content creators as I think it is the lowest common denominator of \u201cwork\u201d, but I would not exclude one from an event. Why OP feels they are entitled in any space they choose is beyond me. Particularly in this case they are not a (paying) parent and do not have a child enrolled in the school.", "Many organisations do background [checks.](https://checks.YOu)OP having an onlyfans will come up pretty quickly.", "> I actually don't either but, like OP, get roped into helping at these things by family, friends, and neighbors all the time!\n\nYou clearly have SOMETHING to bring to the table if you get roped into your family, friends and neighbors' OnlyFans things all the time!", "I have kids, and the amount of time I spent selling cake for the school, helping with dish washing at school events, setting up party tables, organising parties, collecting money, even performing magic for kids\nis astounding. \nUnfortunately I think I'm to old for OF \ud83d\ude43", "We have to be fingerprinted and have a way more thorough background check to volunteer at my kids' private Christian school. They take security very seriously, thankfully!", "Your wording sorta highlights the point even further. Is it really pearl-clutching? We have no idea, cuz OP's sister pulled her aside for a private convo. It's clear that OP will present it as persecution for her job status, when it's sorta obvious that she's unpleasant to be around regardless of her job status. I can easily see myself exclude an OF content creator from plenty of things, but not because they are an OF content creator. It's because it attracts a predictable sort of person that I personally don't find to be pleasant company, because their personality is wrapped around only being pleasant company if they are being paid for it.", "theres no proof that the person who said she has it viewed it. For example hte whole PTA now knows she has an only fans bc that person told them. Perhaps the one person was told\n\n Secondly, watching adult content and being in adult content are not the same LOL. listening to gangsta rap isnt the same as being a gangster rapper, etc.", "They looked at your bank statements line by line?", "It isn't. You have no idea what shunning is if you think it's even remotely the same.\n\n>Volunteer events are social events in this kind of community\n\nYour point being? She's still allowed to come and participate as a community member. Just not a team member of the volunteers.\n\n>Second, you can have deeply held personal and or religious convictions that are wrong\n\nHow is it wrong? There's no right or wrong. People are allowed to like or to dislike it.", "had no idea for a while. I even googled \"of\" :/", "Uhm ok... You know dealers are people right?", "I worry about the one yarn shop owner I know who isn't like that. There's something not quite right about someone with a yarn shop who only knits the same garter stitch blanket in the cheap acrylic when there's all the nice wool and mohair and other fibres around.", "But drugs aren\u2019t people but with SW the labor and the product of the labor is still a person.", "If you are really struggling, try loom knitting.\n\nSince my hands have been messed up by arthritis, knitting and it's fine motor movements is too much for me. But, loom knitting is great. Even the weight of the project can be supported on the frame and not the wrists.\n\nETA\nhttps://youtu.be/gOTIAmg0Iow", "Sex work is an action. An action can not be a person. You're drawing weird arbitrary lines but even those lines are failing you.", "You know you\u2019re not allowed to say that someone who posts her butthole and depressing naked bedroom selfies online for $3 each doesn\u2019t deserve as much respect as someone who uses their brain for work lol. Cmon this is Reddit and a \u201csex work\u201d is just as valid employment as a doing something meaningful."]}
