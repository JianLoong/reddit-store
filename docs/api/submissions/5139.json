You saying it this way makes it sound like your brother and fiance are entitled brats, which is what I think you're trying to go for. What I believe is actually happening is that they canceled the fancy wedding you were planning because it cost *too much* money, and now you feel slighted over that and are taking out your aggression over this MoH thing.

You appear to go out of your way to help people, but just step back and be in the wedding party. Clearly, they didn\u2019t understand the costs of a wedding and you brought that home for them. You saved them a lot of issues this early on before it got scary expensive for them. You might have saved their marriage if you see all of the stress posts about marriage on here. \n\nJust say, \u201cwedding planning is a lot of work, but I\u2019ll step back and be a regular bridesmaid at this point\u201d. It\u2019s a lot safer and might keep the peace even though you were disrespected.\n\nAlso, consider being a wedding planner, you have a skill and it\u2019s impressive.", "They asked me to.", "It shows up in the documents they have to sign :x", "She\u2019s literally talking about that a marriage document has only two signature lines for witnesses", "In Germany you can legally only have one maid of honor. And the groom can only have one best man. There was a time when they also had to sign the document. That's not the case anymore. But they're still mentioned in the document.", "She cannot share because its tots obvs illegal to do so... /s", "She\u2019s talking about the number of witnesses on the marriage document lol", "In some countries you need at least two witnesses to the nuptials to co-sign the wedding documents with the bride and groom. This task usually goes to  the best man and MOH. Sometimes those will be the only two members of the wedding party.", "They asked me to. As I have more experience with these things.", "I agree with this take 100%", "Except I'm not in Spain \ud83d\ude05", "As MOH or as witness? I've never heard of that, since having an MOH isn't required where I am in the first place.", "That just means one person signs. It doesn't mean she can't you have you both in the ceremony as a maid of honor.", "Actually it\u2019s two witnesses not one", "Anyone can be sign as a witness. It\u2019s not necessarily the attendants.", "Witnesses are not the same as bridal party honor titles. You can literally have 5 moh and 5 best men if you want. They just obviously wouldn't all sign the certificate.", "That doesn\u2019t mean you can only have one MoH, it just means that only one can be the legal witness. Whatever you want to call people in your wedding party is entirely up to you and not legally dictated.", "So you can be gay married in Germany but you have to go find one man and one woman to file for marriage? That doesn\u2019t sound accurate tbh", "This sounds like bullshit. [I found this saying that witnesses are not required in civil ceremonies in Germany](https://www.howtogermany.com/pages/marriage.html). Care to explain, OP?", "That's not true. The wedding party can be what the couple wants. Maid of honor and best man are honorific titles, not legal titles. It does not matter who signs as witnesses. Anyone can be the legal witnesses.", "When OP says \"maid of honor\" she probably means the German \"Trauzeugin\"  - which is kind of the next best translation but isn't really accurate because this whole \"bridal party\" thing normally isn't practiced in Germany. We typically don't have bridesmaids and stuff, but brides and grooms often choose a Trauzeuge each (though bridal parties probably get more common these days, thanks to the influence of American pop culture and rom coms).\n\nAnyway, you don't legally need a Trauzeugin to witness your marriage, but if you wish, you can have them and sign your marriage certificate (and in that case, here OP is correct, there may only be two per marriage, though it's gender unrelated). If you want a Catholic church wedding, two Trauzeugen are mandatory.\n\nSo, unlike maid of honor, Trauzeugin isn't an entirely honorary title (but still, formally, a meaningless one because you don't need one).", "EHM.. NO.   \nI got married in 2019 and my BIL and one of my best friends were our witnesses. We had \"wedding parties\" but NOBODY's name appears on the document in that regard.......", "Which, if that's the case, makes this statement by OP even more hilarious because the law doesn't specify who those witnesses need to be. It's just customary that it's the best man and maid of honor. You could literally have Uncle Joe and Aunt Sue come in and be witnesses.", "But not enough experience to realize that she can have a non traditional wedding party and it\u2019s not a personal attack?", "Ok, but it's still *her* wedding, and a good planner would know to try and do the thing that the bride wants for her wedding. If she wants two maids of honor, then that's ok. If she wants to have a non-traditional wedding without you as the planner, then that's ok. If she wants to delay the ceremony until later, so be it.\n\nYou're coming off as whiny for not getting what you wanted. I bet you were fantasizing for months on people coming to you on the day of your brother's wedding congratulating you for putting on such a fantastic wedding. And having to share the MoH spotlight with another person probably has you seething that you're getting even less attention now.", "Must've misread. But do tell us where it's illegal to have more than one MoH?", "Depends on the state.", "Correct. I was a witness for my brothers wedding but I was not in the wedding party.", "That's what my best friend and his fiance did. Everyone in both parties were Maids of Honor and Best Men. It's not against the law lol. OP is just very desperately trying to convince everyone that she's not in the wrong.", "Yep", "It\u2019s not. But OP shouldn\u2019t be calling them \u201cMoH\u201d and best man. You need to have witnesses - two - when you get married and they sign the wedding certificate. This is also the case in Sweden and Poland for instance. So yeah, OP is telling the truth. Legally, the bride can only have one witness.", "Not in Germany,\nHere you are only allowed two witnesses, the \"Trauzeuge\" and the \"Trauzeugin\". The translation for those words would be \" best man\" and \"maid of honour\", so I can understand that there might be a problem in different understandings of the words. And they do have an legal function for the wedding, as they are witnessing it. Even though the law isn't as strict anymore, i.e., you don't need them, but can still have them, for the civil part of the wedding, you do need them if you want to get married at certain institutions, like the  catholic church.\n\nNext to the witnesses you can of course have other people in your wedding party, if you wish.\n\nThe tasks of the Trauzeugen are (slightly) different to the tasks of maid of honours/best man in the US/ other parts of the world I guess.", "Oh 100% you can have two folks from the band do it, at least in Canada. I know because I thought there was a good chance my moh and bm would not make it to my destination wedding lol the only person it\u2019s not supposed to be is a parent", "I ended up getting married at the courthouse on new year's eve for tax reasons (real aka fake wedding happened in early January. Tax difference paid for the caterer). My maid of honor and her boyfriend signed as witnesses as the best man lived in another state and wasn't in town yet. They were running a little late and we lined up another NYE couple that we meet while waiting as back up witnesses. Witnesses do not need to be in the wedding party at all.", "It's not about the party. But about the ceremony at city Hall. The one where they have to sign the document that makes them husband and wife.", "It's not. OP is just trying to win reddit to her side by making the other party look guilty.", "I googled and all I could find was articles from several different countries about how it\u2019s easier and better (less work on one person) to have two.", "You must be one of those Americans who believe everyone on the internet lives in the US.", "Love that idea.\n\nOP is pissed because she planned a wedding that didn't happen and it all got changed. She somehow thinks she's entitled to dictate everything and is just making up nonsense. What a sense of importance and entitlement!", "Sweetheart, that does not change the fact of being able to have as many bridesmaids and maids of honors as you want. \n\nThose are not legal titles. Legal witnesses are a different subject. Many countries require 2 witnesses who are present for the ceremony. Mine does, too.", "I think in the US it can be a parent.", "Lol, I got married at the court house and we didn\u2019t have witnesses so two strangers who were in line behind us did it. \ud83d\ude02", "Your logic here doesn\u2019t make sense to me at all. You\u2019re upset that another SIL might sign their documents but so upset that you just may not participate in their wedding at all? That sounds so petty to me. Two people have to sign, yes, but you can\u2019t tell them who signs anyway. It\u2019s not really your business. And importantly, they never said you couldn\u2019t be the one to sign. They just gave two people moh in the ceremony.", "Can you both still be there?   Why do you both have to sign you can\u2019t still be it and not sign the paperwork", "Of course you are able to have as many bridemaids as you want, but you can only have one Trauzeugin", "I\u2019m not sure they would have stopped us from using a parent, but we had already asked the band if they\u2019d be ok with it and they said yeah. The party did end up showing up so it didn\u2019t work out that way, but it would have been cool if it had.", "I got married in the Bahamas and our dads signed so there are some countries where that's fine.", "I got married in the US and our kids were our witnesses.", "That's hilarious. I love that for you guys.", "If your kids were 18+, then yeah.", "After having spent a few years working weddings, every single other vendor I knew either made a wedding they could use to promote their business in or eloped/had tiny destination weddings. We had 7 guests (4 parents, the couple that introduced us and their young daughter - who were nervous travelers, hence the back up plan) far away from home and then a local, larger reception about a month later. Absolutely cannot recommend it enough. It was genuinely so easy and fun.", "I think in some places minors can sign as witnesses as long as there are also adult witnesses."]}
