Your laughing at the situation and implying this woman is 'superior' to your friend implies that you see their relationship in terms of an imbalanced power dynamic where she has the upper hand and will likely try to sabotage him/make his life harder.

A relationship that short is barely a relationship, and if they were able to stay friends afterwards then it's not a big deal. He doesn't have a problem with it, his ex doesn't have a problem with it, so I don't know why OP has a problem with it. It's not any of his business anyway.", "You keep missing the work part. This isn\u2019t about going to have coffee. It\u2019s their livelihood.", "You\u2019d be fine it seems, lots of people would not.

What a silly thing to say.\n\nYou keep missing the bit where the OP said he mocked his friend for his ex being superior to him. Instead you're beating the dead horse of 'is it better to have a personal relationship with your boss or a solely professional one', which is not the actual subject at hand or the question being asked.\n\nYou don't seem to be capable of comprehending the actual discussion underway, or of reading either responses or the original post.\n\nThankfully there's a mute button for the terminally tedious.", "Eh I work in a professional field and know a lot of people including myself that have had office romances. You spend 1/3 of your life with these people. It's quite a common thing.", "Because the only person whose opinion about this matters is the friend, and he's fine with it. So why is OP laughing at him for it? It just sounds like the friend and his ex are more mature than OP. There's no indication that she will treat him any differently than the other employees. Why are you beating the \"it's so unprofessional!?\" dead horse?", "Yeah, with people getting preferential treatment or not so preferential as a result of their outside of work activities.", "It\u2019s humiliating and unprofessional."]}
