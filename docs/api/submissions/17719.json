He\u2019s a typical man and doesn\u2019t go to the doctor. He has had lower back/kidney pain forever and basically has central obesity so there\u2019s probably something wrong but he won\u2019t go to the doctor. \n\nMy immediate family is also very poor. My dad had opportunities to get 6-figure jobs but was too prideful to leave a local business that gave him more autonomy over his own schedule and being his own boss. So for my entire childhood I was extremely impoverished. I was also abused regularly by him as a child probably because I wasn\u2019t \u201chis own blood\u201d. He was my first bully and my mother was the passive parent. I remember being hit so hard I\u2019d be left with handprints on me. From ages 5-13 I never left my room except to go to the bathroom because he would be over my shoulder otherwise to \u201cmake sure I wasn\u2019t being naughty\u201d. Once I could leave the house I was never home. \n\nWhat\u2019s ironic is his blooded children are either disabled or bums who will live with them until my parents die. I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s independent. I got kicked out at 19 so I had to work for myself. \n\nAnyway, my grandmother (step dads mother) made a comment about how I better get ready to take care of him. I laughed at first but she was serious and repeated herself. I told her he can get fucked and die in a ditch for all I care. She was utterly shocked to say the least. She told me I was an AH cause he provided for me for my whole childhood and I owe him that. Then I told her she better leave him some inheritance to retire (cause he doesn\u2019t have a retirement, moms SAHM) since she\u2019s rich and has a really good pension. I left shortly after. \n\nAITAH?", "created_utc": 1684570657, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13mlzff/aitah_for_telling_my_step_dads_mother_she_better/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also you gave her really good advice.", "NTA, a bit brutal, but N T A. You reap what you sow, and he's failed you and by failing to plan for his future, himself. ETA, sorry, I meant brutally honest. She can't expect you to look after someone who has made it painfully obvious that he regarded you as a burden, and abused you physically and mentally. I guess she'd better step up for him instead.", "NTA you\u2019re better off just cutting them out of your life completely.", "NTA but why don't you enlighten her about how well he \"provided\" for you during your childhood? She sounds shocked at your words, so give her the context.", "NTA- Contrary to popular belief, You don't owe your parents a single goddam thing. Biological or otherwise.", "NTA - you \ud83d\udc4fdon\u2019t \ud83d\udc4fown\ud83d\udc4fan\ud83d\udc4fabuser\ud83d\udc4fanything \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "NTA The principle of taking care of your parents when your old, sketchy as it is, is based on them caring for you when your too young to care for yourself, not abusing the child then expecting them to be grateful for it. And a stepparent can't even make the dubious and extortionist claim of holding having brought you into this world over your head.", "I have a question, did this woman know what her son has done at you?", "NTA\n\nHe was an abusive prick and you owe him nothing.  You're not even a blood relative.\n\nIf his mother is so rich, has she always been like that... and if so, was there any reason she left you all in poverty... or was she worried about providing for the non blood relatives in the house ie you... the person she now expects to look after him.  Hahahahahahahahaha.\n\nYou were blunt and to the point.  Good on you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good for you for sticking up for yourself.", "Honestly I know what I said was brutal. But she wouldn\u2019t give it up. She\u2019s incessant on this topic so I\u2019m sure she\u2019s worried about what\u2019s going to happen to him after she dies.", "I know. I\u2019m already very low contact. I plan on moving away after I graduate college. I just rely on them right now for a few things.", "She knows we were poor growing up. That we were on all kinds of government assistance. Plus I don\u2019t think she\u2019d care. When she grew up beating your kids was normal and not a reason to cut off your parents. She knew at the minimum I was a troubled child just not explicit details.", "Thank you. The entire claim for them was that my step dad paid for everything for me growing up. But tbh I think that\u2019s a lame excuse because we were so poor that we had government benefits for everything.", "Not particularly no. But she knows he\u2019s not that great of a husband because for the entirety of my life my mother would vent to her about her marital problems or lack of being a father. But there was no specifics. Plus I\u2019ve heard her talk about corporal punishment before and she doesn\u2019t consider it abuse. So it wouldn\u2019t be worth the conversation. She\u2019s an old school boomer and believes that you should care for your parents no matter what they did to you.", "She was always rich. Had a really good government job her whole life and retired with a huge pension. \n\nMy step dad was far too prideful to ask her for money. If she did loan a large amount of money for an unexpected expense he would always pay her back even if it meant us going without. She still provided for us as kids in other ways like for Christmas or if we needed school clothes or something. But it was never anything substantial to get us out of poverty.", "Ah lol, it's NTA anyway but I wanted to believe that she might just be.. unaware and against these actions", "Yea I know. It\u2019s kind of a too little too late situation in my head. Even if she did know specifics I don\u2019t think her stance would change as my step father is her son and she wants him to be okay after she dies. She\u2019ll gain solace knowing he won\u2019t be homeless."]}
