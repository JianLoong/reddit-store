This stems from her earliest years. I was married to her abusive father, my anxiety manifested as anger, and I yelled at my kids a lot. But after 11 years of therapy and gentle parenting, we all (my kids and myself) have come a long way. All of my kids are now well adjusted and emotionally mature for the most part, because we've all (again, my kids and myself) worked very hard to make their emotional adjustment a priority since the divorce.\n\nMy daughter does still feel things very intensely and when she is tired, hormonal, or frustrated, she tends to get angry and does not always express the anger in a mature way. She *is* neurotypical, if it matters.\n\nFriday she came home from school and I did something that annoyed her. She went into claws out anger mode. In the midst of her \"tantrum\" she still had somewhere to be for a school obligation, so I asked her what time we needed to leave. (This is me ignoring her outburst.) Then I heard a thud from her room. After a couple of minutes she came out saying that she had broken her phone by throwing it on the floor. I fiddled with the phone and confirmed that it is unusable and that she will need a new one, but she would need to wait until I get paid at the end of the week. She agreed, and then told me it's her fault the phone is broken so she understands. (Again, she has a lot of emotional intelligence when she wants to. She is addressing her explosive anger in therapy, at her request.)\n\nShe will be getting her license this week so her not having a phone will be inconvenient but not the end of the world. She will be at her dad's. I texted him that she does not currently have a phone. I told him it was broken without going into details, and that I'd be replacing it after I get paid this week. He started going on about how could I send him to her without any mode of communication, what if he needs to get ahold of her when she's at school or practice, and how very inconsiderate of me it was to not replace it prior to her coming over. I elaborated and told him the reason for the phone breaking and that I consider it a natural consequence to her actions. He told me that I should consult him next time regarding her punishment, and that it is an AH move for me to leave him without any way of communicating with her. I told him that I have her friends' numbers in my phone and that if I need her during the day I can text one of her friends. She tends to forget her phone at home a lot so this is something that is not new and has been going on for years. I also communicate with her through her brother. They go to the same high school and have two classes together so they see each other during the day. He continued going on about how if she misses drum or sports practice this week and gets in trouble, it's on me because I took away her phone. He continues to insist I am the AH.

It means a lot.", "She will be, don\u2019t worry!", "I\u2019m not sure I understand your comment?\n\nIf he wants to replace her phone, he would have to either buy a burner phone (fine by me) or buy her a new phone with a new number and set it up on his account, not mine. Which is also fine because when she comes back next week I\u2019ll have replaced her phone on my account so he would have just wasted money because he is inconvenienced. Which would then be a consequence for him.\n\nShe already understands that her not having a phone is a consequence of her actions. She\u2019s far from a brat, I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that she\u2019s dealing with her anger in therapy and is remorseful over this incident.

I don\u2019t really care if he does or not, but he\u2019d be wasting money bc as soon as I can I will be replacing her phone and she won\u2019t use his anymore.", "I mean he can buy a phone outright and your daughter can put her SIM card in it. No need to buy a second phone, and she stays on your plan. Does that makes sense?", "Yeah I get where you\u2019re going. The likelihood of him doing this is slim to none because he\u2019s a cheapskate."]}
