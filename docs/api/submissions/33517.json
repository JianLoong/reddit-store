They cry poor mouth and everyone goes running to help. Im talking cars , home additions and remodels, mortgage payments, all kids sports, Christmas, school clothes , birthdays, anything you can think of someone else pays for. By my estimates they have swindled a half million dollars plus.\n\nThey both have very good paying jobs ,well into the six figures and one of them even has a company car and the company pays for their wifi and cell phone.  Yet for some reason they never have any money. They don\u2019t drink or gamble or take any fancy vacations.\n\nSo when I found out my brother in law swindled another freebie I got angry, and told my mother in law my family doesn\u2019t need her gifts and clearly the other side of the family needed them more , give our gifts to them. It has been radio silence ever since.\n\nThis is not about the financial aspect. It\u2019s that they continually give to one and not the other.  Making my family feel like no matter what we do it\u2019s never good enough.\n\nOn multiple occasions my mother in law tells us all about all the things she pays for and buys the kids rights in front of my son.

Good riddance to the lot of em.", "NTA but why the hell didn't you cut her off sooner after she was being cruel to your child?", "\nNTA Favoritism and enabling behavior are incredibly frustrating. Understandable that you'd be upset about the unequal treatment and decide to distance yourselves from the situation. Your honesty may have ruffled some feathers, but sometimes a blunt approach is necessary to address ongoing issues.", "NTA. Going no contact with a narc when you are the scapegoat is the best you can do to your mental health and, frankly, a duty when you yourself are a parent, because your kid cannot protect himself and because you have the duty to teach him that what his grandma is doing is wrong and not acceptable. The risk to raise someone who will think that being mistreated in family is ok and normal is too high", "Good idea. NTA", "Let the favorite child have Christmas with Madame Drunkie from now on. You and your family will be much happier once you've escaped the nest of dysfunction. Be sure their numbers are blocked and muted through the middle of January at the least. You don't want them calling to pick a fight during your well-earned peaceful holiday.\n\nNTA.", "I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019d want an alcoholic narcissist around your kid anyway.

I wish I knew the appropriate term and could understand the psychology of it all. (We have a similar situation in my family and it is mind boggling.)

That makes you the A. Be careful about playing in other people's family business or you're likely to discover yourself on the outs with your Husband, which is by far worse than being treated oddly by his mother. Now that you've done the dirty deed, throw your support behind your husband and what *he* feels is the best for *him and his family*.
