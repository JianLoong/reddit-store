Good riddance to the lot of em.", "NTA but why the hell didn't you cut her off sooner after she was being cruel to your child?", "\nNTA Favoritism and enabling behavior are incredibly frustrating. Understandable that you'd be upset about the unequal treatment and decide to distance yourselves from the situation. Your honesty may have ruffled some feathers, but sometimes a blunt approach is necessary to address ongoing issues.", "NTA. Going no contact with a narc when you are the scapegoat is the best you can do to your mental health and, frankly, a duty when you yourself are a parent, because your kid cannot protect himself and because you have the duty to teach him that what his grandma is doing is wrong and not acceptable. The risk to raise someone who will think that being mistreated in family is ok and normal is too high", "Good idea. NTA", "Let the favorite child have Christmas with Madame Drunkie from now on. You and your family will be much happier once you've escaped the nest of dysfunction. Be sure their numbers are blocked and muted through the middle of January at the least.

That makes you the A. Be careful about playing in other people's family business or you're likely to discover yourself on the outs with your Husband, which is by far worse than being treated oddly by his mother. Now that you've done the dirty deed, throw your support behind your husband and what *he* feels is the best for *him and his family*.

I\u2019d also argue that since it involves her child as well it is 100% her business. I would say that OP is NTA. Although from this comment it is pretty clear that you are an AH hahahaha", "Found the Mother in Law! Sounds like her husband is behind his wife and IS supporting what's best for THEIR family.", "NTA, but I have to give you some grief for not protecting your child from them sooner. He was clearly feeling the negative aspects of your mother in laws treatment, but you were so worried about KEEPING THE PEACE that you ignored how that could affect your son. You didn\u2019t keep HIS peace, you kept YOUR OWN. This whole concept of \u201ckeeping the peace\u201d does in fact HURT OTHERS and you shouldn\u2019t cater to ADULTS WHO HAVE GROWN AND LEARNED BETTER over catering to a CHILD, YOUR. CHILD. if you let his grandma treat him that way and say \u201cit\u2019s to keep the peace\u201d you are absolutely telling him that his feelings aren\u2019t important enough for you to EVEN TRY and fix the bad behavior. \nYou have to care about your son MORE than you hate confrontation", "Good for you, your MIL is obviously someone who needs to be needed. She is a people pleaser and the other people have figured it out. Since you can clearly take care of yourself she has no use for you. Send her a cheers to being a women who can take care of her own family. And move on. Make sure you take lots of great pictures and send them around", "At least you don't have to worry about taking care of her in her old age; the favorite family gets that pleasure! Of course, that family will NOT take care of her, but maybe they will visit her sometimes. NTA and good for going NC!", "NTA. You don't need toxic people like that in your life. Your family will probably be a lot happier after going NC. Merry Christmas!", "NTA.", "NTA Good to cut contact now, cus you know they are going to want to lean on you in their old age and there\u2019s no way the moochers are going to help.", "NTA", "NTA. You are doing the right thing.", "NTA. Sounds like this is an addition by subtraction situation. Who would want these kind of people in their lives anyway?", "My former mil favored 1 outta 3 of my daughter's and her other granddaughter..took them places my other 2 girls couldn't go to. She would buy them expensive stuff and not as expensive stuff for the other 2..paid for tennis lessons, they had thier own special room at grandma poppins.( that's what she called herself. She would say \"practically perfect in every way. I would talk my my husband about it and he wouldn't say much. Even now, my favored daughter see's relatives my other 2 don't. Thier grandpa,  grandma's Poppins, lol, ex husband,  favors them too. What's ironic is my husband (at the time) and his sister were left out as kids as Thier cousins were the  favorites.  So WHY, would she do the same thing. I understand what your going through... My girls actually see now how they were all treated. Keep your head up! Love your kids and husband and be happy without all that b.s. rooting for you.", "NTA. And good for you. Leave that toxic stuff in the dust.", "No contact sounds like the way to go. The whole bunch of them sound toxic.\n\nYou can block them on social media and on the phone. You'll need to decide what to do when JNMIL ( /r/JUSTNOMIL ) shows up at your door. And make sure to remove them from the school contact list if they're on that.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nBut, yeah, this needed to happen sooner once your kid noticed. \n\nBlock and don't respond to anything. No explanations. She just wants the reaction so don't give it", "NTA  \nAnd in a few years Granny is going to wonder why your son does care about her. You don't need the aggravation.", "NTA! Glad you and your husband are on the same page about going NC. It sucks and it\u2019s unfair what the in-laws do. They are missing out on a true relationship with your family. \nI am LC with my mother. She does so much for my brother and his family (he was planned and I was an accident/mistake, her words). She\u2019s flown to visit him regularly, helped him move, has paid his rent a year in advance and once bought him a house. Meanwhile the one time she allowed me to borrow money I got to pay it back with interest. My kids are now adults and totally understand the score with their grandmother. When they were kids I shielded them from her antics to the best of my ability. With going NC your kid(s) won\u2019t have to be subjected to the inlaws\u2019 hurtful behavior.", "NTA. Ugh I hate people like that who are constantly getting free shit just because everyone wants to fuck them (or be them or be associated with them, which is tantamount).", "NTA. Should have gone no contact a long time ago. As for your son, tell him the truth, she is a crappy person who you don't want around any more.", "Yes,  nc is the best option here. Block them on everything.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing!! Good riddance to them!", "Block them for all time.", "You nailed it. Mooching, or sponging would be the correct terms."]}
