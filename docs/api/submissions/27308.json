She was crying and embarassed. I also told her this was only going to be between the 2 of us, I wasn't going to tell anybody else in the family. I told her this as I handed her the final payment from the estate and I told her what my grandfather had told me: that he had always hoped she would pay her family debts back: to his son (my father) first but also to him.\n\nBack story info:\nI was the executor for my grandfather's estate, and before he died he made it a point to tell me that he always wanted my aunt to repay her family, but he also wanted her to repay the loan she took from my parents before they paid him (my grandfather) back what they had borrowed many years ago.\n\nIt wasn't a lot of money that they borrowed from my parents, maybe a few thousand dollars but they did borrow more than that from my grandfather. This also would have also been about 30 years ago so it would have been a lot more money at the time. I don't think there is any expectation of interest, just the initial loan would have been expected to be paid. Also it would have been a small fraction of the inheritance that they were about to receive and at the time of the loan it wasn't an insignificant amount for my parents to lend her. \n\n\nFurther backstory of this is:\n\nMy parents had to work a lot and my mom had several jobs when I was younger, but my aunt and uncle were on various government assistance programs for as long as I can remember. They also took advantage of these programs like having some jobs when they shouldn't have been collecting benefits and taking advantage of people.\n\nMy parents aren't poor and can live without being repaid, but they're far from being rich. Their retirement plan will be selling or taking equity from their house, also my mom's job is working at a big box retail store.\n\nI'm also not very close with this aunt. She would have babysat me and my siblings when I was younger, but in the last 20 years I would have only seen her a few times at weddings and funerals (I would have seen my three other aunts from this side of the family many many more times than the sand during that same period). Also, they've never been more than a 20 or 30 minute drive away from my or my parents house.\n\nAlso, I know my grandfather would have had the choice to make a point about these debts in the will and have the payment to my aunt be lower. However, he probably just wanted her to make the right decision during his life time.", "created_utc": 1695260185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16o2vf3/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_to_pay_her_debts_with/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also sounds a bit like she's been ducking your side of the family for some time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill, unless you have evidence of these debts and are willing to take her to court over them, you can't exactly make her.", "NTA.\n\nShe's probably dealing with a lot of emotions and you, as the executor, were passing along the request of the person who empowered you.", "NTA\n\nYou're following your grandfather's wishes", "NTA. Your grandfather felt he needed to pass on the info and you did. What she does with it now is on her and her heart.", "Too bad your grandfather didn't specify that she'd get her portion less the monies owed to her lenders. IOW she gets the remainder of what's left of her portion after her debts are paid.", "Not enough info. What does the will and codicils say? Unless you have something written down, it does not count. She can sue the estate and win. I agree that that was his intention but as executor, you have to go by the law.", "NAH and I'm sorry about your grandad.\n\nMoney makes us all crazy. It sounds like both your aunt, and your parents had owed some money to him before he passed away.\n\nHis wish was that your aunt AND your parents would settle their debts. You're not an asshole for telling her that. \n\nYes, the money is owed to your parents, but they also owed money that can't be payed back now. Perhaps the least asshole-ish thing is to wash your hands of all this money stuff.\n\nIMO, nobody here is an asshole for feeling the way they feel.

Hope she does the right thing but don't count  on it .", "NTA. Sounds like one of my aunts. Debts are meant to be paid, but some people never do. Rather than ableing them, they should be held accountable more. Sounds like you were reasonable about it as well.", "I'm surprised grandfather didn't have it included in the will.*** If, when I die, Marry Sue still owes Betty Jane money the value of it will be taken from her portion of the estate, valued as $XXXXX***\n\nWould have made things right, and given his most troubled child a clean slate.", "Thank you and also just to clarify my aunt borrowed money from my parents and my grandfather.

It was honestly the best thing that ever happened. She knew that we hadn't gotten letters to meet with the lawyer. It was funny as heck. She was so mad and she had to pay it back quickly which made her angrier. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Still makes me laugh 20 years later.", "NTA you were conveying your Grandfather's wishes that's all.", "Grandpa should've put it in his Will.

Mildly insensitive of him that he didn't just make a deduction from his bequest or leave those instructions to her in writing if that's what he really wanted.", "You're NTA, but your grandfather was. Hoping his daughter would \"do the right thing\", instead of paying the debt himself out of his daughter's share would have taken care of it.", "The way it's worded, I don't think OP was trying to say, \"Hey, pay my parents back, or we'll sue you.\"  They were just trying to convey what their grandfather said wanted.  Pretty much \"Hey I can't tell you what to do, but...\"", "I don\u2019t think OP meant they took the money out of her portion. OP just told her when they handed her the check that grandfather wanted her to pay back the debt to OPs parents. So it was her choice if she wanted to pay it back or not. Op was just relaying the message."]}
