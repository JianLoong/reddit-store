NTA", "NTA, people should use headphones. I have never understood this. If you want to listen to something, and the people you share a space with don't-put on headphones, and then you're both happy?? Otherwise you're saying your enjoyment, happiness, and ultimately laziness is more important than others and what they want.\n\nHowever I wouldn't also mention how bad TIKTOK is for her when asking for quiet - it is brain rotting non stop all day, but that's not up to you to decide for her.", "Its just a basic, common courtesy in a shared space. NTA.", "NTA. As much as I dislike TikTok, people are allowed to enjoy them. She's not allowed to force them on you, though.", "Nta.  This is extremely rude behavior.  It's not hard to put in an earbud.", "NTA. That would drive me insane. Yes, it's her home, but it's your home too. You aren't asking her to not watch it, just to use headphones. It's a common courtesy when you're around literally anyone.", "This is even worse than people who play music on their phone on the bus. At least you can just get off a bus, you LIVE in that. \n\nShe can relax just as easily with headphones on, you can't if she doesn't. Not exactly equitable. NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhat barn was she raised in?  Headphones are a totally reasonable accommodation and her response shows she has very little respect or concern for you.  I'm impressed you're satisfied with the 30 minutes of conversation you get.  Does she recount the day's best Tik's?  Re-evaluate if the relationship is two way.", "NTA. Does she not realize that it\u2019s your home, too? If she can\u2019t compromise on this tiny (and totally reasonable) thing, that\u2019s a bad sign.", "INFO\n\n> We're living together\n\nHave you considered not?", "NTA, it is your home to. She can put on headphones to not disturb others.", "NTA - People have been justifiably maimed for less", "Nta, I personally think that social media is extremely unhealthy (as i am browsing reddit).\n\nI think tiktock is really annoying and agree that she should have the respect for you to use headphones.", "NTA\n\n\"If you refuse to use headphones while using tiktok, this living arrangement will no longer work for me and I will have to move out to my own place.\" That's Called a boundary.", "NTA- I know your exact frustration. It literally feels like a surreal dose of insanity listening to someone else watch Tik Tok. The grating robotic voices, the repetitive unfunny sound clips, the constant and abrupt change in sounds. And to boot they're in a dopamine-junkie-trance the entire time and don't realize the time wasted and people disturbed. They need to put in headphones and not subject you to the vacuous abyss that is Tik Tok. Turning the volume down is not a real solution, the only 2 options are they need to stop using the hellish app or to put headphones in.", "I''m the same I can't drown out tiktok noise as it changes so often. \nYou should be able to let your brain wind down too and sounds like this is a constant happening in the house!

It's the considerate thing to do.", "NTA.  I hate that. It\u2019s like nails on a chalkboard to me.  I bought my husband wireless earbuds.  I am usually pretty easy going but when it comes to playing on your phone out loud I just can\u2019t.", "I went out with a lady that did this.  I would be in bed reading stuff on my phone or even trying to sleep and she would watch these mind-numbing TikTok garbage videos out loud.  She would even try to get me to watch and I told her I wasn't interested.  \n\nI stopped dating her.", "NTA but you also sound quite arrogant so swings and roundabouts", "NTA. Tik Tok is especially grating becauae volume levels, type of noise and sound quality fluctuate so much.", "I mean, the logic of I will inflict my viewing content on you doesn't really make sense does it. What if you played death metal at a high volume. It's your home too right? All of a sudden, that doesn't work. \n\nThis somewhat depends if you can be somewhere else though. Do you have to be in the same room when that's what she's doing? Seems like an easy compromise at least. \n\nNTA for asking a question if that's indeed all you've done. Sounds to me like you need to work something out though because from how you've written your post it sounds like you're about to snap.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My hubby games and I ask him to use headphones when I am getting ready for bed.", "NTA. She's being inconsiderate. By playing them out loud, she's forcing you to listen to them.

We have a small apartment and the (unwritten) rule is if the tv or record player is going and you want to hear a video on your personal device you put on the headphones. They live in a special spot next to the sofa for that reason.", "NTA. I think the whole headphone thing is the best compromise. I work night shift and sometimes I\u2019m awake at all hours of the night so I\u2019ll watch Netflix on my phone, while the hubby sleeps, with my headphones in. It\u2019s just a common courtesy for others in the space.

The amount of people who don\u2019t realize that we don\u2019t all want to hear whatever they\u2019re listening to is astonishing.", "NTA - My coworker does this and drives me insane.\n\nA video, sure.
