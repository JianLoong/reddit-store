You don't really CARE whether or not she comes, clearly since you're willing to allow her to stay home, but god forbid she do something enjoyable for a week in the summer instead of doing what you want her to do.  This is a GREAT way to ensure when she turns 18, she doesn't attend ANY family functions.", "Yeah, she's 17.  She's almost a (legal) adult.  \n\nYTA.\n\nAll you are doing - is increasing the liklihood of a reduced/minimal relationship with her after she becomes a legal adult, and can't be controlled by you.  Especially given that your wife is okay with it.", "YTA - for forcing her to go and honestly a week long family reunion sounds dreadful\n\nHell I don't even like going to a 1 day family reunion and I love my family and my wife's family", "INFO\nWhat was your relationship with your parents/guardians at the age of 17?", "Well, you're doing a fine job of making sure your daughter will hate your side of the family - including you.\n\nShe's 17. Not 12. In another year she is a legal adult and then what are you going to do to get compliance - physically force her? Use the time honoured, \"it's my way or get out\"?\n\nYour high-handed \"do it or else\", authoritarian form of parenting is just plain wrong and is going to blow up in your face if you can't figure out a way to gracefully transition into a new, mutually respectful relationship with your daughter.\n\nGood luck with that OP, you'll need it. Stop being a hardhead, apologize and let her go with her boyfriend. Ask you wife to mediate.\n\nYTA.", "I do not understand why her options were to 'come with us or stay home' - that suggests you don't really care whether she comes to the reunion at all, and you'd rather she stay home alone than go do something she actually wants to do. That to me makes YTA. \n\nHonestly I think it's fair for you to want her to come - N T A for that - but if I were you I'd let her go with her BF's family. It will do more for your relationship, whereas forcing her to come with you will harm it.  \n\n\nEDITED: change of judgment", "\"Your family tradition,\" sounds like your daughter will be creating her own traditions. \n\nFrankly, if her choices are be bored and miserable with you, or bored and miserable at home without you, I understand her future choices. \n\nYTA.", "YTA.  You'd rather have a sullen 17 yr old around at this reunion? And if mom is OK with her going with bf and family, why are you saying she either goes to your reunion or stays home?  Do you really dislike your daughter that much?", "YTA. And be honest here. This isn\u2019t about her not wanting to go. It\u2019s about you having to explain to your extended family why she isn\u2019t there. \n\nTeens either want to go to family reunions or they don\u2019t. If they want to, it\u2019s because they feel connected and look forward to seeing those relative that they only get to see on an annual basis. \n\nIf they don\u2019t want to go, it\u2019s because they have either other plans (boyfriend/friends), or they just have outgrown the usual fair of seeing relatives they only see annually who\u2019ll ask them the same questions and they will be bored. \n\nMaking her go will now only add to her not wanting to go in the future because before you know it, she\u2019ll be old enough to decide on her own and you won\u2019t be able to force the issue. \n\nThen you\u2019ll have to explain to your extended family why she never attends\u2026", "Yes YTA.\n\nYou need to cut the cord man. She's gonna resent you if you don't. \n\nShe's been with a committed boyfriend for three years and she's almost a legal adult - the best thing to do for your parent-child relationship right now is to respect her autonomy in this.\n\nIf I'm doing the maths here correctly - you were only a year older when you became a parent.. so surely she's old enough to go on a trip with her partner.", "YTA\n\nIf she was 7 you\u2019d have a case about forcing her. She\u2019s not 7. She\u2019s 17.

You know what she really felt, yet you blatantly disregarded all of that in favor of yourself.\n\nForget \"forcing\". Manipulating is more accurate.", "I have parents like you when I was growing up as a teen.  At your daughter's age, my own parents refused to let me go out on many a good shindig with high school friends because of ridiculous non-reasons like this, usually because they wanted me at my brother's sports tournaments and play happy family/make them look good.  Needless to say I was miserable.  I never had those opportunities again because of a parent like you, and I didn't want to go for the same reasons.  I still resent it.  And if I'm a betting person, I'd wager she will resent you in the same way.\n\nWhat do you stand to benefit from barring her from going on this trip with her boyfriend's family?  Only that she might have a good time doing something new and possibly have someone her own age there.

She\u2019s grown and she doesnt want to go. You\u2019re only making her hate the whole thing. It wont do any good to force her. \n\nI\u2019m curious why you think she NEEDs to go to the reunion?", "YTA. You ARE forcing her to go. This trip with her boyfriend and his family could be one of the most important formative memories of her teenage years, of course she doesn't want to go to the same repeated family reunion that she clearly said she doesn't have fun at.\n\nUnless you have some issues with her boyfriend's parents and their ability to supervise them, why can't she go?", "YTA. Forcing social events onto your 17 year old is a great way to make sure she never attends as an adult, which will be next birthday. She\u2019s telling you that it\u2019s no fun for her, but you\u2019re going to force her anyway.  Is it just about control for you?

Well, actually, we do know. It\u2019s all about your ego and power trip. YTA", "YTA\n\nAt this point, why would want her to come at all after she made it more than clear that she doesnt wanna go to the family reunion. She will be super unhappy and annoyed, and no one gains anything out of her being forced to come it in the end.\n\nYou said its every year, so there will me more years where she could tag along. Meanwhile the holiday with her boyfriend and his family is probably a one time thing.\n\nShe is nearly 18, your wife is okay with it and you just seem controlling.", "She had other plans.\n\nYou are forcing her to go, no quotes needed.\n\nYTA", "Well, you asked so YTA. All you're doing is causing her to associate family trips with punishment. At 17, she's old enough to choose.", "It\u2019s always good to consider other people\u2019s wants and feelings instead of just focusing on your own\u2026\n\nYTA", "YTA. Idk why you put \"forcing\" in quotes, that's what you're doing. You have given her two options, neither of which she wants. If you would be fine with leaving her at home, what is your problem with letting her go with her boyfriend?", "YTA. For every reason stated by everyone else. She\u2019s 17 and she\u2019s been in a relationship for 3 years. This isn\u2019t some guy she only met a few weeks ago. Give her some credit for making good choices.", "I'm going with YTA here.\n\nIt's not fair to her to force her to go to someplace she isn't a big fan of!\n\nShe's old enough to want to do different things and as the only person with the problem with it, I have to say you are being inconsiderate.\n\nI understand family is important but letting your daughter go will make her far happier.", "This is absurd. YTA. She is bored while at the family reunion which makes it clear that you and your wife aren\u2019t paying attention to her and neither are others. She won\u2019t continue to come to family reunions out of want or tradition when she already hates going. But now that you weaponized this trip to keep her from spending time with her BF and his family she definitely won\u2019t. And then you admit to manipulating her by saying she could stay home? That\u2019s gross and terrible parenting. \n\nAre you upset that she wants to spend time with a family other than yours? Are you worried that she will be out of the house soon and will genuinely miss her? Will you just miss the control over her? You haven\u2019t given one actual reason why she can\u2019t go to this trip with the boyfriend", "If you're okay with her staying at home it means you don't even really want her to come and it's not about family time, but about keeping her away from her boyfriend. YTA.", "Info: why doesn\u2019t you wife like your family?", "YTA. She\u2019s a person who should be able to make her own decisions.

Like I bet she\u2019s went to several of these family reunions and honestly being the youngest sometimes doesn\u2019t give you the best time as there\u2019s not much to talk about with older people other than school. Also, she\u2019s basically an adult and I bet you trust her boyfriend and his family if they\u2019ve been together for 3 years and this is a great opportunity for her that won\u2019t really happen any time soon. Like, I understand wanting to have her be part of a family gathering but I honestly doubt she would\u2019ve wanted to go either way and this will just drive a wedge between her and your side of the family.", "Alternative headline 'I have ruined my relationship with my daughter because no one really knows'", "YTA let her go on the trip", "YTA", "Yes, YTA.", "YATA!\nYou said what you said. It seems to me you have a bigger issue about the boyfriend. As it has been said before, you have a controlling issue, or maybe it's a trust issue, either way, it's and inhibition YOU have to deal with and not by taking it out on her. You probably also feel a lot of fear in regards to this situation, your little girl sleeping at a boys house, you knowing how boys are and all of that combined would rather have you alone, unsafe, at your house alone. Instead she could be protected and having fun with people who clearly enjoy her presence as it seems during your family reunion no one's bothered enough to pay her attention. She's viewed as a child and treated as such, clearly her BF family respects her differently. If I were you I'd try to figure out and unpack what's really bothering you and then finding out how you can suck it up and support your daughter in living her life and not restricting it to your boundaries. Children should learn to fly, we don't control where they fly, we make sure they always have a safe space to return to. Good luck on all your future endeavors.", "YTA, she is old enough to make her own choices.

Perfectly reasonable boundaries for parents to set. (Although doing some math with your ages, maybe you aren\u2019t the best person to be setting examples about being too young for adult relationships and lifelong consequences that can come from making choices you weren\u2019t prepared for\u2026)\n\n2) made it a lesson about commitments to obligations and promised her next year she can have full authority to plan her summer, including her choice to attend this reunion or not, provided she made the choice appropriately in advanced, and stuck to her commitment \n\n3) shorten the time spent at the reunion or asked her if there was an activity or area she\u2019d like to explore while you were away that could be incorporated on the trip as a compromise so she enjoys herself\n\n4) if she really absolutely did not want to go, give her an alternative that wasn\u2019t a trip with the BF if that\u2019s the sticking point. Yes, that includes staying home where she may enjoy herself more, not threatening her with staying home as a punishment. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are many other ways to approach this too, but you chose probably then worst way.

But, the fact that you said she could stay home, but she still couldn't go on the trip with her bf and his family, makes YTA. Clearly it's not about tradition, family, or experience.

At one point, one of his friends was asking him about what he would look for in a new girlfriend, and he pointed to her picture where she was holding the pike and said \"That's the girl for me!  Someone who likes to fish!\"  \n\nMy daughter was bartending and heard the conversation, and replied: \"I clean my own fish too!\"  The guys cracked up, but her classmate asked her out right then and there.

OP or his wife (probably moreso his wife) sitting down with their daughter and explaining their concerns as well as the importance of safe sex will likely go much farther than trying to outright prevent it.  It may also create a dialogue where daughter would feel more comfortable coming to them with questions or concerns (like if her boyfriend is pressuring her, or if she\u2019s unsure what is the best method of contraception, etc.)", "The thing is if that's the case and \"she either goes or stays home\" who's to say if she stays home that her boyfriend won't bail on his family and stay with her.

He was the only one who moved away (like an hour away), so all of their kids were best friends, but I was just a lonely outsider when they'd send us kids off to play. They were all very nice and I liked them as people, but I'd come to dread Halloween every year because it'd just be another night of trick-or-treating and then quietly sitting by myself at the outskirts of the other kids playing as I snacked on chips. \n\nI never got to go trick-or-treating with my actual friends from school because we always had this obligation. While I'm sure my dad felt good about showing off his family to his friends, it was at the cost of my own comfort and ability to celebrate Halloween with kids that I was close with. As an adult, I get that my dad wasn't intentionally torturing me, but I know I was a kid that didn't want my dad to feel bad, so I never told him how uncomfortable the yearly parties made me. \n\nSo, at the end of the tale, YTA to you, OP.

A bit of math and you\u2019ll notice OP was 18 when his daughter was born, so he would have been around his daughters age now when he got her mom pregnant. He\u2019s likely worried that his daughter is going to come back from this trip knocked up. I do honestly think it\u2019s valid for a parent to be concerned about their 17 year old going on a week long trip with their partner, but if that really is his concern (which from his comments it kind of seems to be) then he went about this completely wrong. Blanket banning her from the trip might stop her from getting accidentally pregnant that week but all it\u2019s going to do is make her angry and resentful of OP (and also ensure she never goes to a family gathering as soon as she\u2019s 18). OP should have sat down with his daughter and discussed his concerns with her like an actual mature adult. They could have both talked about how they feel about the trip and established some ground rules and compromises that would help both be comfortable (like occasional check in texts, packing condoms, etc). Also the BF\u2019s parents will be on the trip so it would totally have been possible for OP to sit down with them too and discuss his concerns so they can help OP feel more comfortable and make sure everyone\u2019s safe. None of those are necessarily easy conversations to have but they\u2019re important. Instead of doing any of that though, OP decided to throw a hissy fit like a toddler.

They have a reunion that she can go to or not but no trip with her bf and family. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f sucks but she will be 18 and then she can \u201cofficially\u201d do what she wants to", "Or OP resents his daughter for not being a controllable little kid anymore.", "Yea. She\u2019ll be able to cut dad off later", "\nBecause he wants to control her & look good in front of his family. OP is selfish. He will be the parent complaining that his adult daughter never visits him in a few years. He\u2019ll blame her even though he was controlling & disrespectful to her.", "Except he'd let her stay home. If it was all about the importance of the reunion, why would he be ok with her staying home?", "Ikr\n\nBack in the day parents just said NO and that's it, no discussion nor even an explanation and if I did even less than op's daughter I would've got beaten the shit out of me for sure", "Same here.", "It\u2019s right to sometimes not let a parent just get their way because they want to.", "She can get pregnant anywhere it doesn\u2019t take a vacation.  Hopefully by NOW her parents have discussed safe sex.  I mean come on", "Yo!! There's the \"information that may have been left out\" that I was barring in my comment. Figured there's more to this. Everyone always has to have an agenda when they make a point smh", "She\u2019s going to miss every future one anyway, so what\u2019s one more?", "Ehh, it's an excuse to get together.   Atleast at ours it's a chance to see the older relatives and such that honestly might not be around in another year or two", "With a generous helping of \"I was a teenage parent and don't actually trust myself that I've raised you to avoid my mistakes\" considering OP's age.", "Oh yeah good point."]}
