You don't really CARE whether or not she comes, clearly since you're willing to allow her to stay home, but god forbid she do something enjoyable for a week in the summer instead of doing what you want her to do.  This is a GREAT way to ensure when she turns 18, she doesn't attend ANY family functions.", "Yeah, she's 17.  She's almost a (legal) adult.  \n\nYTA.\n\nAll you are doing - is increasing the liklihood of a reduced/minimal relationship with her after she becomes a legal adult, and can't be controlled by you.  Especially given that your wife is okay with it.", "YTA - for forcing her to go and honestly a week long family reunion sounds dreadful\n\nHell I don't even like going to a 1 day family reunion and I love my family and my wife's family", "INFO\nWhat was your relationship with your parents/guardians at the age of 17?", "Well, you're doing a fine job of making sure your daughter will hate your side of the family - including you.\n\nShe's 17. Not 12. In another year she is a legal adult and then what are you going to do to get compliance - physically force her? Use the time honoured, \"it's my way or get out\"?\n\nYour high-handed \"do it or else\", authoritarian form of parenting is just plain wrong and is going to blow up in your face if you can't figure out a way to gracefully transition into a new, mutually respectful relationship with your daughter.\n\nGood luck with that OP, you'll need it. Stop being a hardhead, apologize and let her go with her boyfriend. Ask you wife to mediate.\n\nYTA.", "I do not understand why her options were to 'come with us or stay home' - that suggests you don't really care whether she comes to the reunion at all, and you'd rather she stay home alone than go do something she actually wants to do. That to me makes YTA. \n\nHonestly I think it's fair for you to want her to come - N T A for that - but if I were you I'd let her go with her BF's family. It will do more for your relationship, whereas forcing her to come with you will harm it.  \n\n\nEDITED: change of judgment", "\"Your family tradition,\" sounds like your daughter will be creating her own traditions. \n\nFrankly, if her choices are be bored and miserable with you, or bored and miserable at home without you, I understand her future choices. \n\nYTA.", "YTA.  You'd rather have a sullen 17 yr old around at this reunion? And if mom is OK with her going with bf and family, why are you saying she either goes to your reunion or stays home?  Do you really dislike your daughter that much?", "YTA. And be honest here. This isn\u2019t about her not wanting to go. It\u2019s about you having to explain to your extended family why she isn\u2019t there. \n\nTeens either want to go to family reunions or they don\u2019t. If they want to, it\u2019s because they feel connected and look forward to seeing those relative that they only get to see on an annual basis. \n\nIf they don\u2019t want to go, it\u2019s because they have either other plans (boyfriend/friends), or they just have outgrown the usual fair of seeing relatives they only see annually who\u2019ll ask them the same questions and they will be bored. \n\nMaking her go will now only add to her not wanting to go in the future because before you know it, she\u2019ll be old enough to decide on her own and you won\u2019t be able to force the issue. \n\nThen you\u2019ll have to explain to your extended family why she never attends\u2026", "Yes YTA.\n\nYou need to cut the cord man. She's gonna resent you if you don't. \n\nShe's been with a committed boyfriend for three years and she's almost a legal adult - the best thing to do for your parent-child relationship right now is to respect her autonomy in this.\n\nIf I'm doing the maths here correctly - you were only a year older when you became a parent.. so surely she's old enough to go on a trip with her partner.", "YTA\n\nIf she was 7 you\u2019d have a case about forcing her. She\u2019s not 7. She\u2019s 17.

You know what she really felt, yet you blatantly disregarded all of that in favor of yourself.\n\nForget \"forcing\". Manipulating is more accurate.", "I have parents like you when I was growing up as a teen.  At your daughter's age, my own parents refused to let me go out on many a good shindig with high school friends because of ridiculous non-reasons like this, usually because they wanted me at my brother's sports tournaments and play happy family/make them look good.  Needless to say I was miserable.  I never had those opportunities again because of a parent like you, and I didn't want to go for the same reasons.  I still resent it.  And if I'm a betting person, I'd wager she will resent you in the same way.\n\nWhat do you stand to benefit from barring her from going on this trip with her boyfriend's family?  Only that she might have a good time doing something new and possibly have someone her own age there.

She\u2019s grown and she doesnt want to go. You\u2019re only making her hate the whole thing. It wont do any good to force her. \n\nI\u2019m curious why you think she NEEDs to go to the reunion?", "YTA. You ARE forcing her to go. This trip with her boyfriend and his family could be one of the most important formative memories of her teenage years, of course she doesn't want to go to the same repeated family reunion that she clearly said she doesn't have fun at.\n\nUnless you have some issues with her boyfriend's parents and their ability to supervise them, why can't she go?", "YTA. Forcing social events onto your 17 year old is a great way to make sure she never attends as an adult, which will be next birthday. She\u2019s telling you that it\u2019s no fun for her, but you\u2019re going to force her anyway.  Is it just about control for you?

Well, actually, we do know. It\u2019s all about your ego and power trip. YTA", "YTA\n\nAt this point, why would want her to come at all after she made it more than clear that she doesnt wanna go to the family reunion. She will be super unhappy and annoyed, and no one gains anything out of her being forced to come it in the end.\n\nYou said its every year, so there will me more years where she could tag along. Meanwhile the holiday with her boyfriend and his family is probably a one time thing.\n\nShe is nearly 18, your wife is okay with it and you just seem controlling.", "She had other plans.\n\nYou are forcing her to go, no quotes needed.\n\nYTA", "Well, you asked so YTA. All you're doing is causing her to associate family trips with punishment. At 17, she's old enough to choose.", "It\u2019s always good to consider other people\u2019s wants and feelings instead of just focusing on your own\u2026\n\nYTA", "YTA. Idk why you put \"forcing\" in quotes, that's what you're doing. You have given her two options, neither of which she wants. If you would be fine with leaving her at home, what is your problem with letting her go with her boyfriend?", "YTA. For every reason stated by everyone else. She\u2019s 17 and she\u2019s been in a relationship for 3 years. This isn\u2019t some guy she only met a few weeks ago. Give her some credit for making good choices.", "I'm going with YTA here.\n\nIt's not fair to her to force her to go to someplace she isn't a big fan of!\n\nShe's old enough to want to do different things and as the only person with the problem with it, I have to say you are being inconsiderate.\n\nI understand family is important but letting your daughter go will make her far happier.", "This is absurd. YTA. She is bored while at the family reunion which makes it clear that you and your wife aren\u2019t paying attention to her and neither are others. She won\u2019t continue to come to family reunions out of want or tradition when she already hates going. But now that you weaponized this trip to keep her from spending time with her BF and his family she definitely won\u2019t. And then you admit to manipulating her by saying she could stay home? That\u2019s gross and terrible parenting. \n\nAre you upset that she wants to spend time with a family other than yours? Are you worried that she will be out of the house soon and will genuinely miss her? Will you just miss the control over her? You haven\u2019t given one actual reason why she can\u2019t go to this trip with the boyfriend", "If you're okay with her staying at home it means you don't even really want her to come and it's not about family time, but about keeping her away from her boyfriend. YTA.", "Info: why doesn\u2019t you wife like your family?", "YTA. She\u2019s a person who should be able to make her own decisions.

Like I bet she\u2019s went to several of these family reunions and honestly being the youngest sometimes doesn\u2019t give you the best time as there\u2019s not much to talk about with older people other than school. Also, she\u2019s basically an adult and I bet you trust her boyfriend and his family if they\u2019ve been together for 3 years and this is a great opportunity for her that won\u2019t really happen any time soon. Like, I understand wanting to have her be part of a family gathering but I honestly doubt she would\u2019ve wanted to go either way and this will just drive a wedge between her and your side of the family.", "Alternative headline 'I have ruined my relationship with my daughter because no one really knows'", "YTA let her go on the trip", "YTA", "Yes, YTA.", "YATA!\nYou said what you said. It seems to me you have a bigger issue about the boyfriend. As it has been said before, you have a controlling issue, or maybe it's a trust issue, either way, it's and inhibition YOU have to deal with and not by taking it out on her. You probably also feel a lot of fear in regards to this situation, your little girl sleeping at a boys house, you knowing how boys are and all of that combined would rather have you alone, unsafe, at your house alone. Instead she could be protected and having fun with people who clearly enjoy her presence as it seems during your family reunion no one's bothered enough to pay her attention. She's viewed as a child and treated as such, clearly her BF family respects her differently. If I were you I'd try to figure out and unpack what's really bothering you and then finding out how you can suck it up and support your daughter in living her life and not restricting it to your boundaries. Children should learn to fly, we don't control where they fly, we make sure they always have a safe space to return to. Good luck on all your future endeavors.", "YTA, she is old enough to make her own choices.

Perfectly reasonable boundaries for parents to set. (Although doing some math with your ages, maybe you aren\u2019t the best person to be setting examples about being too young for adult relationships and lifelong consequences that can come from making choices you weren\u2019t prepared for\u2026)\n\n2) made it a lesson about commitments to obligations and promised her next year she can have full authority to plan her summer, including her choice to attend this reunion or not, provided she made the choice appropriately in advanced, and stuck to her commitment \n\n3) shorten the time spent at the reunion or asked her if there was an activity or area she\u2019d like to explore while you were away that could be incorporated on the trip as a compromise so she enjoys herself\n\n4) if she really absolutely did not want to go, give her an alternative that wasn\u2019t a trip with the BF if that\u2019s the sticking point. Yes, that includes staying home where she may enjoy herself more, not threatening her with staying home as a punishment. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are many other ways to approach this too, but you chose probably then worst way.

But, the fact that you said she could stay home, but she still couldn't go on the trip with her bf and his family, makes YTA. Clearly it's not about tradition, family, or experience.

If you\u2019re ok with her missing the reunion to stay home then you should let her go on the trip with her boyfriend. If this is something that happens every year then her missing one won\u2019t be a big deal. From your comments I imagine your wife \u201cnever liked your family\u201d because you force them on her and make them a priority over other equally important things. Stop trying to control everything and let your daughter enjoy her youth.", "It was okay because I was listening to them and I knew they wanted the best for me", "It is understandable for OP to want his daughter to attend but its not understandable that he is forcing her to miss out on the trip. YTA.", "Because i know she'd never stay at home alone", "I'm willing to bet that it has more to do with some outdated notion of \"propriety.\"  He feels that he needs to worry about  his daughter having the opportunity to have sex (whether or not that's even a consideration on her part is irrelevant). He knows HE would be vigilant, but doesn't trust the BF's parents to be as vigilant.", "As someone who was forced to attend countless family gatherings where I was usually one of only three kids (the other two being my younger siblings) I agree 100%. Nobody but my parents cared that we were there, most of them didn\u2019t even talk to us cause they were too busy drinking and arguing about hockey.\n\nYTA", "18 is right around the corner\u2026", "Normally, I would agree, but my personal experience with a daughter and vacation was the opposite experience.\n\nMy daughter was dating a boy who was really bad news (into drugs & drinking).  I \"forced\" her to go on one last family vacation when she was 19, and it was torture!  (By forcing her, I told her she could either come with us or stay with grandma for a week - I was not letting her stay at our house with her boyfriend due to his drug use!).\n\nA bit of background - my kids *LOVE* to go fishing.  Every family vacation HAD to include fishing somewhere.  We had started going to this lake in the middle of nowhere Minnesota a few years earlier, and the kids couldn't get enough of it. \n\nWhen we got to the lake, we met our neighbors - a bunch of guys around her age.  They hit the docks with their fishing poles, and so did she & her dad.  Soon, she pulled a huge pike out plus several nice crappies.  The guys took pictures and adopted her for the week.  \n\nOn the drive home, she told us it was the most fun she ever had.  Plus, the boys next door treated her so well, she realized the boyfriend wasn't and had decided to break up with him.  \n\nA few days later, the girls at her job (waitresstbartebder at a mom & pop bar & grill) posted pictures of what they did on summer vacation and she added pictures of her with her various fish hauls.  That Friday night, a former classmate of hers was at the bar with some friends, celebrating his ending his engagement to a girl who didn't treat him well.  At one point, one of his friends was asking him about what he would look for in a new girlfriend, and he pointed to her picture where she was holding the pike and said \"That's the girl for me!  Someone who likes to fish!\"  \n\nMy daughter was bartending and heard the conversation, and replied: \"I clean my own fish too!\"  The guys cracked up, but her classmate asked her out right then and there.  They've been together ever since (married now for 3 years and have 2 boys of their own). \n\nSo, if I hadn't forced her to go, she might not have met her now husband again, and her life wouldn't be near as happy as it is.  I know this is probably an aberration but there can sometimes be fairytale endings!", "And a double YTA for using \"forcing\" in the title as if that's not exactly what OP is doing.", "\u201cFamily will be there for you and this is a yearly tradition\u201d also means family should be there outside of the ONE week a year they get together.  It means that they should be happy when one of the family is doing something they truly like.  It means they recognize that not everyone is happy/entertained/fulfilled at the family reunions. \n\nFamily above all means that no one in the family is ever really happy within the family.", "Spend enough time around this subreddit and realize that \"family comes first\" only applies to your family, not everybody else's. Even the OP's wife doesn't like his family, and she's been married into it for \\~20 years, presumably.", "I have a teenager and I say OP is TA.", "\u201e I said it didn't matter and that she was either coming with us or staying at home\u201d\n\nOp doesn\u2019t care if she doesn\u2019t go to the reunion and stays at home.", "You listened to them? Really? They told you to become a father at the age of 18?", "So you are saying that the best thing for your daughter is to spend a week being bored and feeling left out?\n\nAnd echoing others, you were listening to them when you became a father at 18?", "Sure you did.  You were a perfect angel and never ever disagreed with your parents.", "Interesting that you view your submission as the primary cause for an \u201cokay\u201d relationship with your parents", "But why was their views/wants actually what was best?", "Your family didn\u2019t care what you wanted so you don\u2019t have to care about what your daughter wants is that it? Break the cycle don\u2019t perpetuate it.", "But you dont want whats best for her. You want whats best for YOU in this case. You have no reason other than YOUR family reunion and you dont care about her feelings at all.", "How is going to a boring family reunion \u201cbest\u201d for her?  Honestly, how?  She\u2019ll resent you, have a crappy time, and mostly, start planning how to leave at 18 and get away from your control and manipulation.", "How is going on a forced family reunion what is best for your daughter?\n\nOr, do you get to decide what's best for a seventeen year old?", "So...manipulation?", "To reiterate in my comment, you're being manipulative and controlling.   Not the best thing to do to maintain ANY relationship, much less the one with your child.", "So you're just making manipulative threats. Got it.", "Bro, you do know that is called manipulation, right? Manipulating your daughter and asking whether you are the asshole?\n\nLolwut", "So you are an AH. Why are you even here other than to try to get support for your shit choices no one, including your wife, agrees with? Kids gonna leave in a year and be free from you forever. I wish her the best and hope she enjoys every moment of her life free from under your heel while you sit around whining \u201cwhy don\u2019t me kids visit me?\u201d \n\nStop the manipulation and controlling BS, or say goodbye to your relationship with your kid. \n\nYTA of course.", "So you came here to find out if YTA. Now that you know you are, will you apologize and allow her the freedom to choose? If not, you are the super A!", "YTA and you're being manipulative. She is almost a legal adult. Why wouldn't you let her do something she actually wants? This is why kids go nc. You're making a big mistake with this.", "You're awful. What have you got against boyfriend and his family? Why doesn't your wife like your family?", "Ick.", "Perhaps. But even the strictest parents come to realize that their kids will do certain things they prefer they don\u2019t do. And chances are they\u2019re already active, or, have been active and probably would behave more so on a trip with his parents, then they have while they\u2019ve been  while dating and unsupervised.", "Yep, and my parents forced me to do shit like this and that was the first things I stopped attending once I hit 18. Dad is on with daughter not going and staying home, but not ok with her going in the other trip. Sounds like it\u2019s all about the control in my opinion", "However this situation is very different OP'S daughter has pointed out on all the other trips she is completely bored, OP has mentioned ZERO problems with HIS daughter's boyfriend and it is basically a family trip. Boyfriend's parents will be there. This is not a final family holiday that has things everyone will enjoy this is an annual reunion where daughter has been extremely bored. And his option is not come with us on holiday or go stay with another family member. It is come to reunion or stay home alone. Knowing that she'll never stay home alone. Do you see the differences?", "also family betrays family and the betrayed person is told to suck it up and not rock the boat and \u201cyou know how they are\u201d etc etc etc", "What that tells me is that OP's wife doesn't share my sense of family values, or OP's, which is a bit messed up.  Just my opinion.", "No, he obviously cares or else he would have just let her go with her BF.  His execution was less than ideal, but he obviously cares.", "Oh I get it now.  OP never really grew up!\n\nRealistically, he probably became a father at 17.", "Ridiculous right? Try forcing her to do the same at 18 and he\u2019s looking at fracturing the relationship with his own daughter simply to make a point by exerting control.", "There are, objectively, shitty families. Not every family is pleasant to be around, not every family stands up for one another. Not everybody is equally close to their family. \n\nFamily values are all well and good, but why should a family reunion necessarily trump every other endeavor?", "So your family values are more important than anyone else's. No one else is allowed to have different opinions on family", ">which is a bit messed up\n\nWTF??!! Is your sense of family values the golden standard?", "For sure, but OP didn't say that, so I wasn't going to guess and assume that is true.  OP's kid is just doing what a teenager would instinctively do - opt for going with her boyfriend instead of a family gathering.  It's not an unusual reaction, but no one is an AH for parenting and keeping the family together for a reunion.", "Yes.  Parents should be on the same page about that kind of stuff.  I would never tell my daughter one thing while my wife told her something else about a decision like this.  OP should have discussed it with Mom and they both should have told their kid what their answer was.", "I think the line \"you either go with me or stay at home\" is what makes OP TA. Like he's okay with her not being there, he just wants to punish her for wanting to go on a trip.", "That is annual. So very well could go next year. And all the following years. Daughter is bored at these reunions. If she goes on trip she will have something to talk about at next one. Basically daughter is basically is bored stiff through these reunions and we'll OP and his family may be having a fantastic time daughter isn't and if he forces her to go this will be even worse because she'll be resentful and it will show.", "That I sorta agree with you on.  I wouldn't phrase it like that to my kid.  I don't think he was trying to punish her, but rather trying to coax her into \"choosing\" to go when there really is no choice.  If it were me, I would have just called the BF's parents and explained so that option would not have been on the table in the first place and the kid wouldn't have a choice to make.  Same result, but better execution, IMHO."]}
