She is married and they just had their first baby 4 weeks ago. Both she and her husband work full time and she will be going back to work after maternity leave. They live in a house owned by her husband's mother. They pay rent to the mother and she lives out of state. There  is no contract or rental agreement for the house. Just verbal agreement. \n\nEarlier this week they got a call from his brother on his mother's behalf saying the mother is selling the house to another relative for a cash deal. They will likely close in August and they are allowing my daughter and her family to stay in the house for 5 months so they can find someplace else.\n\nMy daughter believes they won't be able to find a rental because they have 2 pit bull mix dogs. \"no one takes pit bulls\". \n\nShe has now decided their only option is to buy a house but their credit scores are not good enough to get financing. I have pristine credit (high 700,almost 800). She is begging me to Co sign a mortgage with her. \n\nHere's my deal. I am single, getting ready to retire in 2.5 years and iam comfortable. I do t own a house because I don't want to. I am fully aware that Co signing means I will be responsible if she defaults. \n\nThis has also messed up the plans that she and I had of moving south with her family once I retire. If they (I) buy a house now I doubt I'd be able to sell it in less than three years time. \n\nAITA if I say no?\n\nUPDATE:   They came to talk to me.  Their credit is so bad they can't be on the loan at all. It would be me buying a house for them to live in.  She is convinced she can turn their credit around before I retire and they will assume the loan. I told them no. I feel like shit. They have a newborn. And I don't want to strain our relationship. But I want to retire and be comfortable.\n\nUpdate 2. She called me about an hour after they left and said her father has agreed to buy a house for them, with the same plan of assuming it in a couple years.  Earlier she had told me her father would not help. I assume she told him I wouldn't help and told me he wouldn't help.  I made the right choice to say no.\n\nUPDATE 3:\nI talked to her father. He did not say he would buy her a house. He told her to look for a rental and if they can't help he would help. He also said he would take the dogs if they can't have them in a rental. My daughter heard what she wanted to hear and that was yes honey, daddy will buy you a house.

If you have time for a cautionary tale, see below.\n\nI cosigned for my daughter almost 10 years ago, and my name was on the deed for the property. She had a 5 year mortgage, so when renewal rolled around, I had to do it again. As I was also about to retire, I paid the fees to have my name taken off the deed so that in two months when the mortgage renewal comes up again, I will say no to re-signing. She was made aware of this, and is not happy. Now with the mortgage rates all up substantially, she is trying to guilt me into doing it for another 5 year term. Hell no! In 10 years of paying the mortgage at the slowest lowest amount, when she had a great job and could have been paying down 5-10 K every anniversary of the mortgage, she bought stuff for her loser BF and went on ritzy vacations. She owes only 30K less than what the original mortgage was for, she has a lower paying job now and her loser BF is in jail. So it's likely she will lose the house as she doesn't qualify for the mortgage in her name only.

He could shoulder it if anything ever happened. \nI don't think your daughter has great judgment.  Taking on a huge debt and entangling your mother in that debt because of your dogs is kind of crazy.

For example, if you got a 2 year ARM with the agreement that when it adjusts she'll buy you out by refinancing the mortgage plus your equity or you'll force the sale. \n\nDefinitely NTA.

Someone who works in mortgages here. Not actively licensed or giving you official advice on rates/obtaining a mortgage/qualification, just giving you some insight into how mortgages often work.\n\nJust so you know this is all probably a moot point if their scores are in the 500s. Oftentimes with mortgages the co-signer is used for the income, not the credit score. \n\nLenders will use the lowest median score of the borrowers. That means if all 3 of you are on the mortgage for most QM programs the lender will use the lowest of the three qualifying scores\u2026which would still be in the 500s.\n\nYou may be able to get some Non-QM loans then, but the issue with that can sometimes mean higher rates and therefore higher payments. Either that or hard money loans, but that is usually a much more expensive way to go about it, especially if they\u2019ve had enough credit trouble that they\u2019re in the 500s. \n\nThere may be a lender out there who would take it and I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be able to go more in depth on your situation. They may even be able to find a program you would all qualify for -  but odds are if they\u2019re on the loan they won\u2019t qualify with or without you. \n\nJust some food for thought!\n\nAnd if you do want to understand a bit better or try to go down this road, talk to a local licensed  Loan Originator who can talk you through the process and qualification requirements.

No one else my age has a house or even thinks having a house is a possibility for them in the future anymore.

However I believe they need to be around 600 to 620. Most places a 650 credit score will get you financed.", "family is not worth putting yourself into a hundred thousand dollars worth of debt.", "Yep. Honestly they probably can't even get approved for a apartment to rent.", "NTA. Right move. Not only do they have bad credit, but credit so bad that the lender don\u2019t even want their name on the application.\nYou\u2019re near retirement and guessing so is her dad. Going into a 30 year $100k plus debt is crazy and every time they don\u2019t pay the mortgage on time, it falls on you. I\u2019m betting that it would happen often.", "NTA\n\nyou have absolute right to say no.  Their credit is so bad WHY????  student loans? reckless spending?  Just curious.\n\nShe does sound manipulative.  Hard to tell so far if she's just really good at self-deception and believes what she wants to believe.\n\nWonder if MIL is selling house because they haven't been paying regularly/on time(and or if they are so underpaying market rate that she felt the need to sell).\n\nHowever, if none of my speculation is true, she can buy them a new house, since she'll have cash to buy LOL.  \n\nDon't let yourself get sucked into this.  They won't be there for you in 2.5 years.  \n\nI really really really would like to know MIL's SIDE of all this(and that she was so reluctant to tell them she had son/brother tell them).  If you ever find out the truth--Please provide update.", "I have 100% payment history and low utilization. My bad credit was from medical debt from a miscarriage that I ended up hemorrhaging from and nearly dieing.  Hospital wouldn't work with me on a payment plan that wasn't 2k a month which was everything I was making at the time. \nI just managed to get mine back into the 600s after all that. \nSometimes people just get beat down.", "Literally 'add in' the fact that they have a newborn baby - instant money pit! - the idea that they'll have \\*any\\* extra money to throw against the mortgage (or even interest) is laughable. They would mostly likely claim poormouth/guilttrip bc of all the new baby expenses.", "Not necessarily. Much depends on where you are. There is a large rescue group here that is apparently one of the largest pit and pit-mix rescues in the country. (They take in any dog they can, regardless of breed, but a huge proportion of the strays they pick up are pits and pit mixes.)", "Relative had been very poor for many years and only used cash(money orders for official stuff).\n\nAfter many years like this--got a checking account... fast forward to trying to move into an apartment--got turned down because relative LITERALLY had no credit rating(they had nothing to base it off). \n\nEncouraged relative to get one credit card--they have at least one charge a month(originally ring doorbell subscription).  Paid monthly.  They got up to high 700s relatively quickly and now approx. 6 years later relative has about 802 on their credit score--might get it higher if they actually had one or two more cards.  Having only ONE actually holds relative down a bit according to the metrics used.", "There are many rescue groups that specialize in pits. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that statistically they are the breed most likely to remain in shelters/be euthanized.", "I understand statistics related to dog rescues. I have three big black rescue mutts whom I adopted as adults \u2013 in other words, the dogs least likely to be adopted, and most likely to be euthanized \u2013 and two of them were feral, which made them even less likely to be adopted. (The third wasn't feral because the feral boys needed a more confident dog to follow.) But there are rescue groups which have quite a good track record when it comes to finding homes for pits and pit mixes. And reputable rescues don't euthanize dogs simply because they've been there a while; they euthanize when they have to, but not for convenience.", "Everything you\u2019re saying is true. But none of it changes the fact that pits are statistically more likely to be euthanized.\n\nShelters are in dire straits now because many Covid pups are being returned. All of the shelters and most rescue groups in my area are overflowing and cannot take more dogs", "I understand that shelters are stressed and over-filled. But if they can't keep their dogs, they can't keep their dogs. Surrendering them to a rescue group is better than abandoning them somewhere, as so many people do \u2013 although none of this is actually directly relevant, since OP's ex said he'd take the dogs if they can't keep them.\n\n(Apparently, in Houston, there's a part of town where people commonly go to abandon their dogs. I know that people will abandon pets all over the place, but I find it somehow even more galling that there could be an area that is known for being just the spot to abandon your devoted dog. I just do not understand how any person with a functioning conscience could ever do such a thing.)"]}
