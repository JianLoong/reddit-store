She had a 5 year mortgage, so when renewal rolled around, I had to do it again. As I was also about to retire, I paid the fees to have my name taken off the deed so that in two months when the mortgage renewal comes up again, I will say no to re-signing. She was made aware of this, and is not happy. Now with the mortgage rates all up substantially, she is trying to guilt me into doing it for another 5 year term. Hell no! In 10 years of paying the mortgage at the slowest lowest amount, when she had a great job and could have been paying down 5-10 K every anniversary of the mortgage, she bought stuff for her loser BF and went on ritzy vacations. She owes only 30K less than what the original mortgage was for, she has a lower paying job now and her loser BF is in jail. So it's likely she will lose the house as she doesn't qualify for the mortgage in her name only.

Someone who works in mortgages here. Not actively licensed or giving you official advice on rates/obtaining a mortgage/qualification, just giving you some insight into how mortgages often work.\n\nJust so you know this is all probably a moot point if their scores are in the 500s. Oftentimes with mortgages the co-signer is used for the income, not the credit score. \n\nLenders will use the lowest median score of the borrowers. That means if all 3 of you are on the mortgage for most QM programs the lender will use the lowest of the three qualifying scores\u2026which would still be in the 500s.\n\nYou may be able to get some Non-QM loans then, but the issue with that can sometimes mean higher rates and therefore higher payments. Either that or hard money loans, but that is usually a much more expensive way to go about it, especially if they\u2019ve had enough credit trouble that they\u2019re in the 500s. \n\nThere may be a lender out there who would take it and I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be able to go more in depth on your situation. They may even be able to find a program you would all qualify for -  but odds are if they\u2019re on the loan they won\u2019t qualify with or without you. \n\nJust some food for thought!\n\nAnd if you do want to understand a bit better or try to go down this road, talk to a local licensed  Loan Originator who can talk you through the process and qualification requirements.

No one else my age has a house or even thinks having a house is a possibility for them in the future anymore.
