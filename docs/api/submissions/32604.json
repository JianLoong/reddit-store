You could have taken one that showed you cared about him and not just something your child won\u2019t remember anyway. \u201cHey look. I knew this day would be hard on you and why I mentioned staying at home. This clearly is not a good place for you right now with everyone celebrations and since we have a lot of good people here that puts them in a position of wanting to celebrate while rightfully feeling bad for you. So why don\u2019t you head home and everyone will understand? I will call you later and maybe later we can grab a beer and talk about how hard this is on you.\u201d", "YTA because you could have definitely handled that in a more tactful way. Shit gets complicated, and he probably thought (and wrongly) that maybe your daughter's party would have been a helpful distraction. Or maybe he just couldn't bear the idea of being alone that day and made the best bad choice. We don't really know.\n\nEither way, instead of telling him to go, you could have told him it was okay for him to leave; he didn't have to stay if he didn't want to. You could have invited him to make use of a private room to have a moment. You could have sent one of the relatives to take him aside and sort him out. There's a dozen ways you could have done it without kicking him out.", "I am sure your making him leave and the ensuing loneliness after will comfort him in his wife's passing.  You definitely don't want something like that \"dampening the mood\".  YTA", "uh yeah, YTA.\n\ni get it. you wanted a day to celebrate your daughter and it's really sad his wife passed on the same day. \n\nyou sounded so understanding at first too. he's going through a lot... of course he's going to be grieving. \n\nyou're NTA for feeling conflicting feelings about seeing him so down, but YTA for telling him to leave. for all you know, this might've been good for him. \n\nidk how long his wife has been gone for, but not everyone deals with grief the same. as his brother you should try and support him. it sounds like you did good at first, you even gave him the opportunity to commemorate her. but telling him to leave in such a fragile state?? that's beyond cruel.", "YTA. Throwing your grieving brother out of your daughter\u2019s first birthday party was extremely insensitive and cruel. Sure, he was having a hard time, but a better approach would have been detailing one family member to sit with him to help him through it, quietly explain his situation to any guests who don\u2019t understand, and just going on with the party. Your daughter won\u2019t notice, your brother\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t destroying the party, this kind of thing is just life, the good and the bad happens at the same time! Handling this sort of thing gracefully isa sign of being an adult, especially being emotionally adult. Do better when the next challenge happens.", "YTA - He's grieving and he needed to be around family, not off by himself. It was nice that you asked him beforehand but IDK if you really got what he was saying:\n\n>He mentioned not planning anything special to honor his late wife, expressing concern about \"stealing the spotlight\" from my daughter's celebration. I reassured him that it was important for him to commemorate his own feelings on this significant day. He chose not to, and attended my daughter\u2019s party instead.\n\nI take this as he wanted to plan something special to honor her... with the family, but was afraid of stealing the b-day girls spotlight. You then said that it's important to he do something for him and his feelings, but in no way said it wouldn't take from the bday girl, or that you guys would be there to honor something for his late wife, or offered any suggestion on how the family could do both. So he was kinda forced to choose be alone (and I'm sure he's already feeling lonely enough), or to suck it up and be happy with the family at the birthday party. He may have thought that being at the party would be a distraction and he would be around family and friends so he could power through. Obviously he couldn't. You could have been empathetic of his situation but instead you went to him and told him to leave because the death of his wife was making him a debbie downer.", "ugh... YTA? I think that fits best.\n\nYou were kind to ask him to take stock in his feelings beforehand and tend to his own emotions/needs. He was certain he'd be okay.\n\nBut that's the thing, isn't it? No one really knows until they are in that moment. You are dealing with a day of profound happiness while he is struggling with a day of profound sadness.\n\nAnd even if it was becoming a bit of a buzzkill (for you? It sounds from your post that it wasn't really bothering anyone else), I feel like the last thing your brother needed was to be cast off and alienated during what is obviously a very difficult day for him. I wish he could have seen that he couldn't handle it and showed himself out, but I doubt he wanted to be alone. I also understand you, as a mother, wanting to preserve the happiness of the day for yourself and your family - that is not what makes you the AH.\n\n I think you needed to be more compassionate. Just a sucky situation altogether. You'll definitely need a different plan for next year.", "YTA for how you handled it, that was tactless and insensitive. You could have asked if he was okay or needed some space, outright telling him to leave was a dick move.", "Oh wow yeah YTA\n\nSo, let me see if I have this right: Your brothers wife died a year ago to the day of your daughters birth and because he couldnt put his grief aside to be merry and bright at the party, you kick him out. Got it.\n\nAs others have said, you could have handled it MUCH better. Put yourself in his shoes. I imagine he wanted to be there for your daughter to celebrate her day, and thought he could contain his grief but because there was family and friends there, his feelings got the better of him.\n\nYou said:\n\n>While the kids were playing, and everyone else was having a good time\n\nSo every one else (but him) were having a good time. So clearly he wasnt disrupting the party nor was he 'casting a shadow over the celebration.'", "Wow, YTA.\n\nI don't even know where to start, or if it's even necessary. Dude, your brother's wife died and he's hurting. Your solution was: please leave.\n\nI... got nothing.", "YTA and you two are going to have to figure this the fuck out. Your daughter will be having many more birthdays and - spoiler alert - they all fall on the day your SIL died. \n\nHe probably shouldn't have come. Maybe your mom insisted he try and it was misguided on her part, which is one of the reasons she went after you.\n\nRight now, he probably wants to be around people when he's alone and wants to be alone when he's around people. My guess is you made sure he will choose the latter when it comes to you. Congrats.\n\nBTW, the only 1-year-old's birthday parties I've ever attended are my own children's. What a fucking waste of time.", "YTA, you could have been kinder. Your 1 year old WILL NOT REMEMBER this party. Was not remotely aware of or understood your brother\u2019s grief. He will remember. Geez dude. Go apologize and sit with him. I\u2019m still scratching my head as to why you didn\u2019t just plan the party for a week later\u2026. Nobody would have noticed least of all the 1 year old and it would have meant you could have spent the day with your brother or another family member who actually cares about him could have", "ESH except for your brother.\n\nIt sounds like all these people were at the party and no one thought to be a buffer between your brothers sorrow and your daughter's celebration. No body thought to take brother into a different area of the house, away from the celebration, and let him grieve without bringing the celebration down. \n\nOPs reaction was to kick brother out rather than ask him to take it elsewhere in the house and settle down.", ">According to her, I\u2019m the asshole because he wasn't bothering anyone and was just grieving. \n\n\nIt sounds like he WAS bothering people though.  Having to be comforted by family members, repeatedly bringing up his wife's death (including details of it)?\n\nHe really should have left on his own accord since it was too much for him to handle.\n\nESH.", "The guy loses his wife a year ago, doesn't ruin the party for your kid and you still kick him out?  And you're asking if you're an AH?  I hope you never have to go through that kind of heartbreak.  YTA.", "Eh .. I have to go with NTA. \n\nYou specifically asked him if he wanted to do something to remember his wife and if he was okay with your daughter's bd party. Then he gets there and makes a scene, stays around & continues to make a scene, making himself the center of attention at someone else's party for their child's birthday. He should have left or gone to another room when he started to lose it. He made your daughter's birthday party all about him.", "This is a rough one. One the one hand, grief is an ill-mannered SOB that shows up when IT wants to, and often when it's the most inconvenient. That said, as someone VERY familiar with grief, I get that while the griever's world is shattered, others' isn't, and that can be very hard to witness. It's hard to watch others be happy when you feel like the world should be grieving with you--after all, this wonderful person in your life is gone, how can the world not be sad?? That's how it feels on that side. And on the other side, while we want to comfort those we care about, it IS exhausting to try to sympathize when you aren't in that same pain they are in. So that all said, I think I have to go NAH.", "Awww so surprised by the number of Y T A. \nWhile it is a valid point that this is the first anniversary of his wife\u2019s passing, you also gave him the option to opt out of the party. He was free to stay home, he was also free to ask if the family could do something in the am or have a moment to remember his wife. There were 1000 ways your brother could have handled it better.\n\nHowever, I may not have asked him to leave as maybe he wanted to be around people. But I would have pulled him aside and maybe had him go inside for a moment to collect himself.\n\nESH", "I understand you laid the groundwork for him regarding his grief and what this party might do but I think he thought he could handle it. When the time came, he realized he couldn't. While I appreciate you tried to mitigate this very situation with your brother, YTA for throwing him out. The guy is suffering and you weren't there for him. Your kid won't remember this so her experience isn't impacted. Asking your brother if he wanted some privacy to go to a different room to work through it might have been better?", "Kinda crazy how no one offered to help him or support him. Sigh this is sad", "I think I'm a little bit of the opinion of ESH. I believe everyone's approach here was bad. Your approach towards your brother when addressing it to him at the party was wrong or insisted that he skip this one but hindsight is 20/20. I feel that while your brother wanted to be there for his niece, when he realized that it was too much to bare then he should have excused himself before it lead to the word-scuffle between you two. And while your mum had good points to make and it made you reflect, perhaps she should have also spoken with your brother about it too, such as \"Honey, while I know you wanted to support your niece on her birthday, I feel that this may be too much with it still being soon after. Perhaps you should go and rest inside (if it was an outdoor party) or in another room or head home if you feel being social is too much now. And i'll come and remember the goods with her after this finished.\"  But again JMO", "I\u2019m confused on why you couldn\u2019t just plan the party for a different day? For this reason alone YTA majorly. It\u2019s a first bday party. Not a Quincea\u00f1era or a sweet 16. Like wow\u2026 your child won\u2019t remember it in the slightest. Not will your child remember the next like 5 of them or so\u2026.", "YTA here.  \n\n\nYou should never set a celebration on the first anniversary of any important death in the family.   \n\n\nGods - it's just occurring to me that his niece was being born while his wife was dying. That is heartbreaking!   \n\n\nYou might research the phenomenon of death anniversaries. They are really potent. And here's what's interesting to me: It happens even with people who don't feel the anniversary is important. It's like our bodies know that the anniversary is here, and we tend to go into a grief state, even if we don't have a calendar telling us that this is the anniversary.   \n\n\nAnyways, it doesn't matter to your child. A caring thing to do would have been to start a tradition of celebrating your child's birth on a different day. Just pick a day! Any day. Just not the anniversary of your brother's wife's death.   \n\n\nI get that you didn't mean to be cruel, but you are. Start thinking about other people. Educate yourself about normal grieving. And if you are thinking that your child should trump every thing else in life, it's time to get over that idea. It's not good for your kid to be raised like that - thinking that their birthday is so important that everything else should just stop for them.", "NTA\n\nThe problem wasn't that he was sad. The problem was that he insisted on being publicly sad at a time and place set aside to happily celebrate your child, and insisted on sharing the details of why he was sad with folks there to happily celebrate your child - including children at a children's party. \n\nI am sad for him that his wife died. \n\nIt is challenging for the entire family that she died on your child's birthday. \n\nIt does not preclude you from celebrating her birthday. Nor for making it clear that this happy event should be separate from active mourning. \n\nBetter you as a family set up a time and place set aside annually to mark passing. And let your daughter's birthday be about her.", "YTA. Grief doesn't have an off switch. It happens when it happens. Your brother might've been trying to hold it together but he can only do so much. So apologize!", "Yes, YTA. You checked with him before hand and that was very kind, but you can\u2019t control someone else\u2019s emotions. You asked him if there would be conflicts with a memorial he was planning, not if he could fake happiness and not express sadness at the party.", "NTA. You did not expect your brother to be able to be in the present on this day, so you gave him an out that he chose not to take. Once he realized he was overcome by sadness, he needed to leave rather than \"steal the spotlight\" as he put it, with his grief. What you can do, though, is ask to go sit with him and listen. He does need to grieve, and sometimes grief feels so heavy that people just shut down when they face it alone\u2014they need the presence of people who care about them to get it out. The attention he was looking for is deserved, just not at someone else's birthday party.", "NTA \n\nLife goes on, you deserve to celebrate your daughter\u2019s birthday.\n\nGrief is real and different for everyone. He knew his emotional state and chose to show up. \n\nIf he didn\u2019t want to be alone he could have called someone. Instead he chose to ruin the time, energy and money you put into the party.", "NTA.  He was trauma dumping on a bunch of kids no less.", "YTA, but I don't want to chide you super hard. Death of a spouse is listed as the most stressful event in a person's life for a reason, and I imagine the anniversary of which is a painful reminder. There's no great solution to a grieving family member at what's supposed to be a happy day, but asking him to leave is one of the worst options.\n\n\nYour cross to bear here was letting your brother stay, even though he was dampening the mood. A year isn't that long an amount of time to be able to cope with such a monumental loss. Apologize sincerely, and try to be a better source of emotional support for your brother in the future.", "NTA. That was a child's birthday, not a commemoration of your brother's wife's passing. If it was too hard for him, he should have left instead of making this happy event about his grief and dumping his pain on your friends. I understand he is grieving but that was not the time nor place to offload.", "How did you ask him to leave, what exactly did you tell him? I think you were right in asking him to leave but maybe you could have been less harsh about your approach (assuming you said it like how you wrote it). Maybe you could have addressed his feelings first, like hey, I know you\u2019re grieving, but it seems like the kids and guests are feeling awkward around you. Would you like to get inside the house (assuming it was held at home outdoors) and maybe try to collect yourself? Something like that. That way maybe he\u2019d realize that his grief is affecting the party. Because if I was in his shoes I\u2019d hate to be that person. I hate inconveniencing/imposing on others. If I can\u2019t do it I\u2019d rather not attend the party. He has all the right to grieve, but a kid\u2019s birthday party is not the best place for that. Maybe you could apologize and try to explain yourself while stressing the fact that you\u2019re very sad for him and are not denying his grief, and that you\u2019re just a phone call away if he needs someone to talk to.", "As you should. YTA", "So you organised all the familial support away from him on this super vulnerable day, then gave him the choice between sucking it up alone or coming.\n\nAnd when he choose to come, couldn't keep it in and got the emotional help of his family, you tried taking it away again ?\n\nYeah, YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One year is too early to ask him to 'not be sad' or 'cheer up' at your daughter's party. The good thing is that babies and young children never remenber their birthdays from 1-4.

Do not envolve brother on birthdays of daughter anymore.", "YTA for asking him to leave and not supporting him. I suspect your brother felt incredibly overwhelmed and wanted to be there to celebrate your daughter but when the reality hit him he couldn\u2019t.

Your approach was insensitive but an adult openly grieving around kids who do not know him, is inappropriate IMO. They don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening and thinking of the kids in my life they would be freaked out. \n\nHe clearly couldn\u2019t handle it like he thought and someone should have quietly taken him away to cry and perhaps gently say this isn\u2019t the best place for him, in the head space he is in.", "ESH he was behaving inappropriately and so were you.", "YTA.

You tried to discuss it before the party. Instead he showed up, and spent most of the party either crying, talking about his dead wife at a child's birthday or generally, maybe unintentionally, stealing attention at someone else's event. He didn't want to do his own memorial event so he turned a 1 year olds birthday party into one. That's not even including how guests and the host had to stop and take time during a celebration to provide emotional support.", "Unfortunately, YTA. \n\nHe shouldn't have come. But once he did and broke down, asking him to leave is cruel. \n\nI'm not sure there's a good response. The only one that comes to mind is you taking him elsewhere - go get coffee.

This is your brother dude, I get not wanting to dampen the party, but there are better ways to deal with this.", "YTA... can you play this back to yourself! Your response to your brother being desperately sad was to tell him to leave because he was ruining the mood. I mean, come on!!!!", "I dont need to read the content. Title suffice for YTA", "And the asshole award goes to..... YOU. I hope you never experience such a profound loss and have the ones you love most cast you away. \n\nYou couldve taken a moment with him aside, acknowledged his pain and perhaps mentioned you'd like to take a moment of silence in his late wifes memory. Perhaps even lit an extra candle on the littles birthday cake in her honor.\n\nInstead, you show no empathy whatsoever and tell him to leave. You can never undo that moment for him, you can never make that right. Even if he accepts an apology from you; it will always be in his mind that his brother showed him no empathy for such a profound loss he sadly has to endure. Shame on you!", "Did you give him a hug first? Before you said that because that\u2019s what he needed. People in early stages of grief can be suicidal. Think about that before you knock him down again. How about you be a good brother find a grief support group and take your brother to it .", "NAH. It was just a bad situation. He clearly didn\u2019t realize how hard it would be for him to celebrate with you on this day that is so sad for him, and then wanted some sympathy and attention for himself in his grief. However, you weren\u2019t in the wrong to ask him to leave if he was going to keep sharing such unpleasant thoughts and feelings at a kid\u2019s birthday party. \n\nMaybe schedule a time to just talk it out with him? You\u2019re always going to have to deal with the fact that your daughter was born on the same day his wife died. No one wants it to be like this, but it is, so see how you can move forward without creating a rift in your family.", "YTA. A first birthday party is never about the child and always about the parents. Stop using your baby who doesn't know wtf is going on as an excuse to be a selfish git.", "YTA. Your daughter won't remember, but your brother will. How could you be so cruel??!!", "Going against the grain here but ESH\n\nBrother - understandably he is going through a very tough time. Especially with it only being a short time since she died. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t on purpose but he did make your daughter\u2019s first birthday about him and his grief. That\u2019s not fair at all.\n\nYou - the way you dealt with this was terrible. This wasn\u2019t the right approach and to fling him out of the party was uncalled for. You could\u2019ve had a conversation with him and explain how you felt.\n\nMom and other relatives - if he cried as much as you said why didn\u2019t any of the adults intervene? If I saw someone that upset I\u2019d have nipped it in the bud. They can\u2019t be angry with you over your outburst!\n\nOverall this all could\u2019ve been avoided. From the beginning the birthday party wouldn\u2019t have happened or been on a different day. Everyone in this situation needed some tact and understanding! Hopefully you can all move past this.", "YTA\n\nYou handled this in about the least empathetic way possible. He\u2019s grieving and almost certainly wanted/needed to be around family that day. It doesn\u2019t sound like he was actively bothering anyone - least of all the birthday girl.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s a birthday party for a freaking 1 yo who couldn\u2019t care less about the party. If she was 12 and actively complained to you about her uncle, that\u2019s one thing. But she\u2019s 1. \n\nAnd you treated your brother like crap because he was a downer at your back yard family bbq (as the birthday was more of an excuse to have a party). I would note that seeing everyone celebrate while you\u2019re grieving does feel like everyone else has just moved on so it\u2019s much harder. Especially the first anniversary. You are a very cold brother indeed.\n\nIt would\u2019ve been far more decent if you respected your brother\u2019s mourning and maybe have a family dinner in remembrance on the anniversary of his wife\u2019s death and hold your celebration the next day. No one would\u2019ve cared and it wouldn\u2019t have come across as so fuck your grief, my daughter is 1 yo today!", "YTA. He\u2019s grieving his wife and you\u2019re more concerned about the picture perfect birthday party your child won\u2019t even remember. Compassion is free", "INFO: How long ago did his wife die?", "YTA Being around someone grieving isn\u2019t fun, but it\u2019s something you do for people you care about.", "YTA - Allow people to grieve safely. You threw him out on a day he needed to be around people. \n\nLife is not one dimensional. Grief and a celebration can occur at the same time. He now knows you don't have the empathy nor capacity to grasp this.  I feel incredibly sad for him; you literally showed him the door during his darkest times.....it's quite unbelievable.", "A child's 1st birthday party is NOT the place to grieve and any fully functioning adult would know that (I'm looking at your mother here too...). When you asked your brother if he would be ok to attend and that you'd understand if he wasn't up to it, I'm very much willing to bet that he thought you all had planned a co-birthday party / remembrance party and your daughter and his wife would be equally celebrated. \n\nPerhaps the family should approach your brother about getting into grief counseling. There's nothing wrong with grieving a loss of that magnitude. The grief becomes disordered if/when the person believes it should take center stage over all happenings in life (not just bday celebrations).\n\nNTA", "YTA your poor brother", "YTA.  Wtf is wrong with you?", "YTA. The baby turned one. The baby didn\u2019t know the date. You should have picked a different day to celebrate and has a small gathering to talk about the wife\u2019s memory. It\u2019s not too late to do that. Apologize to your brother for your insensitivity.", "Yta\n\nBecome more empathetic and learn to deal with someone else grief rather then expecting them to hide or act happy", "INFO \n\nWere the kids in another room or were they in the same place? \n\nIf it was just adults then I think YTA.  If it was the kids as well then NAH.", "Where was your wife in all this? Did you get feedback from her about throwing your brother out of the party? Sometimes other people can save us before we make a mistake.", "This would have been great. Just showing some compassion for his loss and grief.", "I don't need to post my own comment because this one is perfect. 100%", "Agreed.  I understand where OP was coming from, but wow,  tact needed. I was also thinking about the \"hey maybe come inside here and lie down for a few minutes and I'll come check on you\".", "Beautifully stated.", "This is the kid's first birthday, so it's only been a year. Brother hasn't even experienced this anniversary before.", "I'll probably be downvoted. But here goes anyway. \n\nI get that the brother was grieving. \nAnd throwing the birthday party a day later. Or the weekend after would have been the right thing to do. To let him grieve and have support. Proper support from his family. \nI agree all the way there.\n\nBut it wasn't just family present at the birthday.\nBut OP's friends, too? Which got to hear the details about her death as well, while children was running around too. \nHopefully, it wasn't too gruesome details. Not many attend a birthday, and expects to hear how someone died. And it's not stated how well these friends know the brother either. \n\nThat. Is just a bit too much to put on, possibly strangers or people he isn't close to, who was not prepared for that. \nSomeone should have offered if he needed a moment way earlier, possibly their mom, OP, or someone should have taken him inside or something and let him have a moment. \nOr he asked, \"I need a moment. X person, can you come with me for a second?\" \n\nSo there's honestly a bit on both sides here.", "This reply made me change my mind. Good analysis", "Sounds like the brother's wife died the same day OP's child was born, not just the day of the birthday party.", "> Having to be comforted by family members, repeatedly bringing up his wife's death (including details of it)?\n\nsometimes family members care about each other and WANT to comfort each other through their bad times. someone isn't an AH for needing comfort.\n\nit sounds like OP's brother had no one to spend this difficult anniversary with because his loved ones were all attending the birthday party, and he didn't want to be alone.", "Right? Even just saying, \"hey, why don't we sit in the bedroom a minute and see if we can recenter a little\" might have been enough to refocus him, but op went straight to kicking out. Yikes.", "I agree that he was an asshole this time but it is also DEEPLY messed up to set the expectation that a child never celebrate their birthday on their actual birthday because of something else tragic that happened that same day. It wouldn't matter in the early years because the kid doesn't know any better but it is NOT a good precedent to set long-term.", ">Nor for making it clear that this happy event should be separate from active mourning.\n\n\"Hey brother, can you put your grief on hold; no water works today--okay.\" \n\nHumans aren't wired this way.", "I totally agree.", "These 'friends' are adults at a 1 yr old's bday party.  If they had an ounce of empathy they were not bothered.\n\nStop perpetuating people should be removed to suck up profound grief and loss alone. If you cannot be safe with sadness in your siblings home then the world is a cold and cruel place. May you never experience the profound depth of loss and be shunned by someone you though would be there for you.", "And OP didn\u2019t think maybe this day wasn\u2019t the best day for a birthday party ?", "Have we grown so callous as people that basic empathy is not in-action? You addressed catering to adults at the party. Did guests say anything or is this an assumption (or a potential impact)?\n\nHumans will experience the spectrum of life: birth, death, grief, happiness. We do not live in made up worlds like Disney World. Life is multi-dimensional. Grieving historically occurs around and within a community of people. People don't need to 'know' him to relate to sadness. Also, at any gathering people can be sad, depressed, numb from grief, happy, etc. Life throws a lot at us. In this case family knew his heavy deep loos.\n\nIt would have been great if someone engaged him, \"What would help you the most right now?\" Offer suggestions (walk in the neighborhood with me, help me out with 'x' task in 10 minutes) but instead, his sister showed him the door. This is one of the worst things to do: Isolating him from a support group and conveying, 'you're not wanted here in the condition you are in' is appalling. If family cannot support a grieving brother in their home, what else is a home for?    u/throwawayFar-Toe7787 \\- I respect you wanted the day to go in one direction (happiness surrounding the bday) but nothing can control nor erase his loss which occurred on this day. Celebrating and his sorrow is what life dealt to your family and community on this day.", "Agreed!! Well said", "Thank you :)", "People do that all the time. I have a february birthday. I often celebrate my 1/2 birthday in the summer because it's so often snowing when I have my real birthday. Kids in my family have a christmas birthday (twins.) They celebrate earlier so their birthday doesn't become engulfed in christmas.   \n\n\nAll sorts of reasons to celebrate on a day that isn't your literal birthday. And we're all OK. No massive birthday tantrums because we feel entitled to it, either. It's a good thing in a child's life. They need to be seen and acknowledged, but they don't really need a certain day that is \"their's.\" That's projection on your part.", "Yeah. It's not like the 1 year old knows or cares if the party is the next day.", "I second this.", "Me personally I would've pushed it back at least a week", "Every family is different but when we went through something similar we planned for the 1 year because we knew my parents would struggle. Not throw a child\u2019s bday on the same exact day."]}
