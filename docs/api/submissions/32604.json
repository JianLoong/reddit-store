You could have taken one that showed you cared about him and not just something your child won\u2019t remember anyway. \u201cHey look. I knew this day would be hard on you and why I mentioned staying at home. This clearly is not a good place for you right now with everyone celebrating and since we have a lot of good people here that puts them in a position of wanting to celebrate while rightfully feeling bad for you. So why don\u2019t you head home and everyone will understand? I will call you later and maybe later we can grab a beer and talk about how hard this is on you.\u201d", "YTA because you could have definitely handled that in a more tactful way. Shit gets complicated, and he probably thought (and wrongly) that maybe your daughter's party would have been a helpful distraction. Or maybe he just couldn't bear the idea of being alone that day and made the best bad choice. We don't really know.\n\nEither way, instead of telling him to go, you could have told him it was okay for him to leave; he didn't have to stay if he didn't want to. You could have invited him to make use of a private room to have a moment. You could have sent one of the relatives to take him aside and sort him out. There's a dozen ways you could have done it without kicking him out.", "I am sure your making him leave and the ensuing loneliness after will comfort him in his wife's passing.  You definitely don't want something like that \"dampening the mood\".  YTA", "uh yeah, YTA.\n\ni get it. you wanted a day to celebrate your daughter and it's really sad his wife passed on the same day. \n\nyou sounded so understanding at first too. he's going through a lot... of course he's going to be grieving. \n\nyou're NTA for feeling conflicting feelings about seeing him so down, but YTA for telling him to leave. for all you know, this might've been good for him. \n\nidk how long his wife has been gone for, but not everyone deals with grief the same. as his brother you should try and support him. it sounds like you did good at first, you even gave him the opportunity to commemorate her. but telling him to leave in such a fragile state?? that's beyond cruel.", "YTA. Throwing your grieving brother out of your daughter\u2019s first birthday party was extremely insensitive and cruel. Sure, he was having a hard time, but a better approach would have been detailing one family member to sit with him to help him through it, quietly explain his situation to any guests who don\u2019t understand, and just going on with the party. Your daughter won\u2019t notice, your brother\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t destroying the party, this kind of thing is just life, the good and the bad happens at the same time! Handling this sort of thing gracefully isa sign of being an adult, especially being emotionally adult. Do better when the next challenge happens.", "YTA - He's grieving and he needed to be around family, not off by himself. It was nice that you asked him beforehand but IDK if you really got what he was saying:\n\n>He mentioned not planning anything special to honor his late wife, expressing concern about \"stealing the spotlight\" from my daughter's celebration. I reassured him that it was important for him to commemorate his own feelings on this significant day. He chose not to, and attended my daughter\u2019s party instead.\n\nI take this as he wanted to plan something special to honor her... with the family, but was afraid of stealing the b-day girls spotlight. You then said that it's important to he do something for him and his feelings, but in no way said it wouldn't take from the bday girl, or that you guys would be there to honor something for his late wife, or offered any suggestion on how the family could do both. So he was kinda forced to choose be alone (and I'm sure he's already feeling lonely enough), or to suck it up and be happy with the family at the birthday party. He may have thought that being at the party would be a distraction and he would be around family and friends so he could power through. Obviously he couldn't. You could have been empathetic of his situation but instead you went to him and told him to leave because the death of his wife was making him a debbie downer.", "ugh... YTA? I think that fits best.\n\nYou were kind to ask him to take stock in his feelings beforehand and tend to his own emotions/needs. He was certain he'd be okay.\n\nBut that's the thing, isn't it? No one really knows until they are in that moment. You are dealing with a day of profound happiness while he is struggling with a day of profound sadness.\n\nAnd even if it was becoming a bit of a buzzkill (for you? It sounds from your post that it wasn't really bothering anyone else), I feel like the last thing your brother needed was to be cast off and alienated during what is obviously a very difficult day for him. I wish he could have seen that he couldn't handle it and showed himself out, but I doubt he wanted to be alone. I also understand you, as a mother, wanting to preserve the happiness of the day for yourself and your family - that is not what makes you the AH.\n\n I think you needed to be more compassionate. Just a sucky situation altogether. You'll definitely need a different plan for next year.", "YTA for how you handled it, that was tactless and insensitive. You could have asked if he was okay or needed some space, outright telling him to leave was a dick move.", "Oh wow yeah YTA\n\nSo, let me see if I have this right: Your brothers wife died a year ago to the day of your daughters birth and because he couldnt put his grief aside to be merry and bright at the party, you kick him out. Got it.\n\nAs others have said, you could have handled it MUCH better. Put yourself in his shoes. I imagine he wanted to be there for your daughter to celebrate her day, and thought he could contain his grief but because there was family and friends there, his feelings got the better of him.\n\nYou said:\n\n>While the kids were playing, and everyone else was having a good time\n\nSo every one else (but him) were having a good time. So clearly he wasnt disrupting the party nor was he 'casting a shadow over the celebration.'", "Wow, YTA.\n\nI don't even know where to start, or if it's even necessary. Dude, your brother's wife died and he's hurting. Your solution was: please leave.\n\nI... got nothing.", "YTA and you two are going to have to figure this the fuck out. Your daughter will be having many more birthdays and - spoiler alert - they all fall on the day your SIL died. \n\nHe probably shouldn't have come. Maybe your mom insisted he try and it was misguided on her part, which is one of the reasons she went after you.\n\nRight now, he probably wants to be around people when he's alone and wants to be alone when he's around people. My guess is you made sure he will choose the latter when it comes to you. Congrats.\n\nBTW, the only 1-year-old's birthday parties I've ever attended are my own children's. What a fucking waste of time.", "YTA, you could have been kinder. Your 1 year old WILL NOT REMEMBER this party. Was not remotely aware of or understood your brother\u2019s grief. He will remember. Geez dude. Go apologize and sit with him. I\u2019m still scratching my head as to why you didn\u2019t just plan the party for a week later\u2026. Nobody would have noticed least of all the 1 year old and it would have meant you could have spent the day with your brother or another family member who actually cares about him could have", "ESH except for your brother.\n\nIt sounds like all these people were at the party and no one thought to be a buffer between your brothers sorrow and your daughter's celebration. No body thought to take brother into a different area of the house, away from the celebration, and let him grieve without bringing the celebration down. \n\nOPs reaction was to kick brother out rather than ask him to take it elsewhere in the house and settle down.", ">According to her, I\u2019m the asshole because he wasn't bothering anyone and was just grieving. \n\n\nIt sounds like he WAS bothering people though.  Having to be comforted by family members, repeatedly bringing up his wife's death (including details of it)?\n\nHe really should have left on his own accord since it was too much for him to handle.\n\nESH.", "The guy loses his wife a year ago, doesn't ruin the party for your kid and you still kick him out?  And you're asking if you're an AH?  I hope you never have to go through that kind of heartbreak.  YTA.", "Eh .. I have to go with NTA. \n\nYou specifically asked him if he wanted to do something to remember his wife and if he was okay with your daughter's bd party. Then he gets there and makes a scene, stays around & continues to make a scene, making himself the center of attention at someone else's party for their child's birthday. He should have left or gone to another room when he started to lose it. He made your daughter's birthday party all about him.", "This is a rough one. One the one hand, grief is an ill-mannered SOB that shows up when IT wants to, and often when it's the most inconvenient. That said, as someone VERY familiar with grief, I get that while the griever's world is shattered, others' isn't, and that can be very hard to witness. It's hard to watch others be happy when you feel like the world should be grieving with you--after all, this wonderful person in your life is gone, how can the world not be sad?? That's how it feels on that side. And on the other side, while we want to comfort those we care about, it IS exhausting to try to sympathize when you aren't in that same pain they are in. So that all said, I think I have to go NAH.", "Awww so surprised by the number of Y T A. \nWhile it is a valid point that this is the first anniversary of his wife\u2019s passing, you also gave him the option to opt out of the party. He was free to stay home, he was also free to ask if the family could do something in the am or have a moment to remember his wife. There were 1000 ways your brother could have handled it better.\n\nHowever, I may not have asked him to leave as maybe he wanted to be around people. But I would have pulled him aside and maybe had him go inside for a moment to collect himself.\n\nESH", "I understand you laid the groundwork for him regarding his grief and what this party might do but I think he thought he could handle it. When the time came, he realized he couldn't. While I appreciate you tried to mitigate this very situation with your brother, YTA for throwing him out. The guy is suffering and you weren't there for him. Your kid won't remember this so her experience isn't impacted. Asking your brother if he wanted some privacy to go to a different room to work through it might have been better?", "Kinda crazy how no one offered to help him or support him. Sigh this is sad", "I think I'm a little bit of the opinion of ESH. I believe everyone's approach here was bad. Your approach towards your brother when addressing it to him at the party was wrong or insisted that he skip this one but hindsight is 20/20. I feel that while your brother wanted to be there for his niece, when he realized that it was too much to bare then he should have excused himself before it lead to the word-scuffle between you two. And while your mum had good points to make and it made you reflect, perhaps she should have also spoken with your brother about it too, such as \"Honey, while I know you wanted to support your niece on her birthday, I feel that this may be too much with it still being soon after. Perhaps you should go and rest inside (if it was an outdoor party) or in another room or head home if you feel being social is too much now. And i'll come and remember the goods with her after this finished.\"  But again JMO", "I\u2019m confused on why you couldn\u2019t just plan the party for a different day? For this reason alone YTA majorly. It\u2019s a first bday party. Not a Quincea\u00f1era or a sweet 16. Like wow\u2026 your child won\u2019t remember it in the slightest. Not will your child remember the next like 5 of them or so\u2026.", "YTA here.  \n\n\nYou should never set a celebration on the first anniversary of any important death in the family.   \n\n\nGods - it's just occurring to me that his niece was being born while his wife was dying. That is heartbreaking!   \n\n\nYou might research the phenomenon of death anniversaries. They are really potent. And here's what's interesting to me: It happens even with people who don't feel the anniversary is important. It's like our bodies know that the anniversary is here, and we tend to go into a grief state, even if we don't have a calendar telling us that this is the anniversary.   \n\n\nAnyways, it doesn't matter to your child. A caring thing to do would have been to start a tradition of celebrating your child's birth on a different day. Just pick a day! Any day. Just not the anniversary of your brother's wife's death.   \n\n\nI get that you didn't mean to be cruel, but you are. Start thinking about other people. Educate yourself about normal grieving. And if you are thinking that your child should trump every thing else in life, it's time to get over that idea. It's not good for your kid to be raised like that - thinking that their birthday is so important that everything else should just stop for them.", "NTA\n\nThe problem wasn't that he was sad. The problem was that he insisted on being publicly sad at a time and place set aside to happily celebrate your child, and insisted on sharing the details of why he was sad with folks there to happily celebrate your child - including children at a children's party. \n\nI am sad for him that his wife died. \n\nIt is challenging for the entire family that she died on your child's birthday. \n\nIt does not preclude you from celebrating her birthday. Nor for making it clear that this happy event should be separate from active mourning. \n\nBetter you as a family set up a time and place set aside annually to mark passing. And let your daughter's birthday be about her.", "YTA. Grief doesn't have an off switch. It happens when it happens. Your brother might've been trying to hold it together but he can only do so much. So apologize!", "Yes, YTA. You checked with him before hand and that was very kind, but you can\u2019t control someone else\u2019s emotions. You asked him if there would be conflicts with a memorial he was planning, not if he could fake happiness and not express sadness at the party.", "NTA. You did not expect your brother to be able to be in the present on this day, so you gave him an out that he chose not to take. Once he realized he was overcome by sadness, he needed to leave rather than \"steal the spotlight\" as he put it, with his grief. What you can do, though, is ask to go sit with him and listen. He does need to grieve, and sometimes grief feels so heavy that people just shut down when they face it alone\u2014they need the presence of people who care about them to get it out. The attention he was looking for is deserved, just not at someone else's birthday party.", "NTA \n\nLife goes on, you deserve to celebrate your daughter\u2019s birthday.\n\nGrief is real and different for everyone. He knew his emotional state and chose to show up. \n\nIf he didn\u2019t want to be alone he could have called someone. Instead he chose to ruin the time, energy and money you put into the party.", "NTA.  He was trauma dumping on a bunch of kids no less.", "YTA, but I don't want to chide you super hard. Death of a spouse is listed as the most stressful event in a person's life for a reason, and I imagine the anniversary of which is a painful reminder. There's no great solution to a grieving family member at what's supposed to be a happy day, but asking him to leave is one of the worst options.\n\n\nYour cross to bear here was letting your brother stay, even though he was dampening the mood. A year isn't that long an amount of time to be able to cope with such a monumental loss. Apologize sincerely, and try to be a better source of emotional support for your brother in the future.", "NTA. That was a child's birthday, not a commemoration of your brother's wife's passing. If it was too hard for him, he should have left instead of making this happy event about his grief and dumping his pain on your friends. I understand he is grieving but that was not the time nor place to offload.", "How did you ask him to leave, what exactly did you tell him? I think you were right in asking him to leave but maybe you could have been less harsh about your approach (assuming you said it like how you wrote it). Maybe you could have addressed his feelings first, like hey, I know you\u2019re grieving, but it seems like the kids and guests are feeling awkward around you. Would you like to get inside the house (assuming it was held at home outdoors) and maybe try to collect yourself? Something like that. That way maybe he\u2019d realize that his grief is affecting the party. Because if I was in his shoes I\u2019d hate to be that person. I hate inconveniencing/imposing on others. If I can\u2019t do it I\u2019d rather not attend the party. He has all the right to grieve, but a kid\u2019s birthday party is not the best place for that. Maybe you could apologize and try to explain yourself while stressing the fact that you\u2019re very sad for him and are not denying his grief, and that you\u2019re just a phone call away if he needs someone to talk to.", "As you should. YTA", "So you organised all the familial support away from him on this super vulnerable day, then gave him the choice between sucking it up alone or coming.\n\nAnd when he choose to come, couldn't keep it in and got the emotional help of his family, you tried taking it away again ?\n\nYeah, YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One year is too early to ask him to 'not be sad' or 'cheer up' at your daughter's party. The good thing is that babies and young children never remenber their birthdays from 1-4.

Do not envolve brother on birthdays of daughter anymore.", "YTA for asking him to leave and not supporting him.

Your approach was insensitive but an adult openly grieving around kids who do not know him, is inappropriate IMO. They don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening and thinking of the kids in my life they would be freaked out. \n\nHe clearly couldn\u2019t handle it like he thought and someone should have quietly taken him away to cry and perhaps gently say this isn\u2019t the best place for him, in the head space he is in.", "ESH he was behaving inappropriately and so were you.", "YTA.

You tried to discuss it before the party. Instead he showed up, and spent most of the party either crying, talking about his dead wife at a child's birthday or generally, maybe unintentionally, stealing attention at someone else's event. He didn't want to do his own memorial event so he turned a 1 year olds birthday party into one. That's not even including how guests and the host had to stop and take time during a celebration to provide emotional support.", "Unfortunately, YTA. \n\nHe shouldn't have come. But once he did and broke down, asking him to leave is cruel. \n\nI'm not sure there's a good response. The only one that comes to mind is you taking him elsewhere - go get coffee.

It's really not appropriate to be doing what he was doing (talking to strangers at a party about his wife's death when it was clear they were uncomfortable) and perhaps grief was the reason for his lack of insight (but is he usually like this?).  But surely someone else could've taken him for a chat (supportive) even if that person was a stranger to them (one of the OP's friends).  \n\nIn this situation it really wasn't the OP's responsibility because that was to her child (even if the kid won't remember) but there were plenty of other people there that could've helped.\n\nThe kicking him out with no support is where the OP falls into TA category too.

Your child is a year old. Will have zero memory of this birthday or anything that happened at it. You *knew* your brother was going to have a hard time, otherwise you wouldn't have checked in with him prior to the party. \n\n*So, why did you hold the party on this specific day?*\n\nYes, it was the actual birthday. And that's an unfortunate overlap. But this wasn't a child who would be upset or disappointed about not celebrating on THE day. At this age, parties aren't even for the kid. It's for the parents. You could have chosen the day before, the day after, the following weekend or any other day. You KNEW the first anniversary was going to be emotionally difficult for him. \n\nSo you threw a birthday party on the first anniversary of the death. A birthday party that everyone was going to attend because it's the first grand child. So who was home to lend a shoulder for your brother? \n\nYour party meant your brother had 2 options. \n1. Stay home, alone, and deal with this terrible day on his own. \n\n2. Attend the party and try to hold it together so you can be around your loved ones. \n\nHe obviously didn't want to be alone on this day. Many people in his shoes would want comfort and support from loved ones in this situation. \n\nHe tried to hold it together. It's not like he was intentionally trying to steal the thunder of a toddler. He likely didn't realize just how hard not having his wife there was going to actually be. He was likely surprised and upset at just how hard he was actually taking things. He was torn between being alone or trying to stick this out.\n\nObviously, he was going to talk about his wife. It's a real dick move to try and police that. He was at a party with people who either already knew and likely approached to ask how he was doing, and with people who didn't know and were likely approaching to ask what happened/if he was okay/or brought up the topic of spouses (because that's a normal topic of conversation among adults getting to know each other) and he had to clarify that his spouse wasn't here. \n\nPeople could obviously tell something wad wrong. Of course they are going to ask. \n\nSo because of that, you essentially told your brother \"get out, you're making everyone sad. Go be sad by yourself.\"\n\nI get that his wife was not an important person to you. Maybe you didn't know her well or weren't close. That's fine. But she was his wife. His life partner. He came home every night to her. Shared every part of his life with her. And then one day, he came home to a house she would *never* be in again. \n\nYou told your brother that a birthday party for a kid that wont even remember it or understand what it was, was more important than the death of his wife. \n\nWhen you saw him upset, you could have pulled him aside and asked how he was doing. Asked if he wanted a private moment or wanted to talk for a few minutes. You could have asked if he felt okay being there or if there was anything you could do to make the situation better because you were worried about *him.*\n\nBut you didn't do that. Because it wasn't about your brothers feelings. You wanted attention at a toddlers birthday party. You wanted the people there to ohh and ahh over your kid and the idea that they were giving their attention to a more serious matter bothered you.\n\nIf your kid was older, was actually excited about her party, I could understand not moving the party date. But you didn't do this for your kid. You did it for *you*. \n\nIf your kid was upset and worried about uncle because she saw him crying, i could understand asking him to step out *with* you for a sec, give him a moment to collect himself before returning. \n\nWhat you did was shitty, from the top down. It's common knowledge that the first anniversary of a death is a pretty emotionally devastating situation. I imagine you would expect grace and understanding if it was your wife or your daughter that had died. But because it wasn't your loss, and that loss was taking attention away from the \"celebrate me, I gave you the first grand kid\" party you threw yourself, you didn't really care or extend that same grace and understanding. \n\nYou could have made a lot of different choices in the course of this situation. Instead of making choices that supported others, you made choices to support yourself. \n\nYou made a difficult day even more difficult. This wasn't just another Sunday. You marked an important day that already had negative feelings attached, with even more negativity. Your brother will always remember how you made him feel. \n\nRemember that, if you ever find yourself in a similar situation.", "YTA don\u2019t ever talk to someone grieving again.

Honestly 1st birthday parties are for the adults not the baby!

You kicked him out, removed him from family, removed him from what could of been his only source of happiness that day, removed him away from a support circle on a already horrid day. Yeah you asked him if he could handle and bad news he couldn't, but the actions you showed him are that you care more about a birthday party that is about adults not a kid.

I don't know if you have ever been in this situation yourself, grief is inpredictable and it can hit you pretty hard in such moments. \n\nEveryone is different in such situations - many people would have preferred to be on their own but maybe the thought of being alone that day was unbearable to him and he needed you.\n\nI don't think your brother ruined  your one year olds birthday party - he ruined your expectation of it.\n\nCouldn't have there been room for the good and the bad emotions that day?

How scary that might be for them. \n\nGranted, still ok to talk about grief and feelings, but maybe in front of toddlers isn\u2019t the time or place.", "The brother probably also didn\u2019t want to be alone. His family was at the party. It\u2019s messed up to take all that support and expect him to be alone in his grief for a 1 year olds birthday party.", "Yeah that\u2019s a big one for me, its usually days later when I realize \u201coh yeah that\u2019s why I was disproportionately sad\u201d, his death day, his bday, Father\u2019s Day specifically", "Agree fully. That also was her sister in law, I would not be wanting to do a party on the first anniversary of my relatives tragic death. They should have had that day just for him to grieve.", "Yeah, like there are photos of early birthdays of me and my sibling and it\u2019s just our immediate family and grandparents.  I mean it was still a party, with cake and presents and everything, so I\u2019m sure it was fun at the time, but we don\u2019t remember it.  Weird to throw a big party for a kid so young.  Like make sure they have fun, but no need to go crazy like that.  It\u2019s like taking a one year old to Disney - why?  Wait until they are older and can have a really good experience that they will treasure.\n\nAnd under the circumstances it is so much worse.  All their friends and family there and no one to support the brother on the first anniversary of his wife\u2019s death.  And besides not moving the day, which would not matter a fig to a one year old who will just be thrilled something exciting is going on, they didn\u2019t even plan to spend time with him or anything before/after\u2026.  And then they kicked him out for crying and ruining the mood.  Wow.  YTA OP.  YTA.", "The 1 year old doesn\u2019t give a shit, what are you talking about?\n\nBirthday parties are often not on the exact birthday just for scheduling reasons. They didn\u2019t even need to have the party that day.", "A healthy coping mechanism is to surround  yourself with loved ones who will be supportive. Guess the brother learned they aren\u2019t loving supportive people though.\n\nOP shouldn\u2019t have even had the party that day. No one cares if birthdays aren\u2019t on the exact birthday. They usually aren\u2019t just because of scheduling consideration.\n\nOP put all the brothers family support at their place and made the brother choose between trying to suck it up at the party or be alone. That\u2019s not any real consideration.", "Stay home alone, while OP had all the family support at the party. Real nice.", "If he didn\u2019t come he would have no support and be alone in his grief, that\u2019s the other option OP gave him.

Important anniversaries are particularly hard for grieving people, let alone the first anniversary of the loved one's passing.  Rallying around a grieving loved one is far more important than a 1 year old's birthday party.  I just don't understand why OP didn't prioritize their brother over a birthday party that could have easily been postponed by a couple of days.\n\nFor that reason, I am going with YTA.", "Hosting it on a different day may not have helped much. He'd likely be pretty emotionally raw for a few days on either side of the anniversary too.", "Yep. That's what struck me the most. Why wouldn't they just plan the party to be a few weeks late?", "Eh, I think it\u2019s a bad idea to set that precedent.  The brother and OP\u2019s mother might start to expect it.", "He said in the post that he did say pretty much this to his brother ahead of the party.", "Brother may not have wanted to be alone that day and the entire family was at the birthday party.

So, one of the toughest for the brother, and one that the birthday girl won't even remember.", "I'm not saying the brother is fully in the clear... he clearly wasn't ready to be there. But I also think he wasn't ready to be alone. Can only really guess at his headspace. Grief really can put people into a headspin, and it's worse when it's a man grieving, because of the toxic culture put upon men's mental health and expecting them to just suck things up.\n\nIf the kid's birthday party was planned, and he didn't want to be a killjoy, but also felt like he couldn't ask for help or someone to keep him from being alone with his own thought or something, you could very much get this sort of result. \n\nAnd while I see OP's point of view... there's a part of me that wonders, man, what if his brother's actually feeling suicidal and/or super depressed right now? Depression makes people feel terrible for being a burden and asking for help. How could I say brother is an AH for trying to form a link to family when he needs it?", "I mean, I agree. The kid wouldn't care, but the rest of the family would be uncomfortable. This is a sad, kind of \"it sucks\" thing all the way around. I don't think he was wrong in wanting to address the grieving brother... ignoring him having a breakdown completely would also have likely been the wrong way to do it. \n\nIdeally, this is when a family needs to rally together to support one another in taking care of something, sharing the burden of grief and caregiving. Our culture has just gotten so self-centered and selfish, and everybody sort of withdraws when stuff gets awkward instead of pushing in to strengthen the foundation.", "It sounds like everyone at the party had sympathy for him except his own damn brother.", "Exactly. The kid won't even remember the birthday party, but the brother will always remember the pain of losing his wife as well as how poorly he was treated on the first anniversary of her death.", "Seriously, they could have at least raised a glass to her memory.", "we don't know that though. just because someone is breaking down doesn't mean it's a bad thing. we cry to release emotions. him letting it out and finally getting the chance to grieve could be what he needed, yknow?\n\nand if he got MAD about being asked to leave, he probably felt the same.", "They are his family, it\u2019s the first anniversary, and a birthday for a 1 year old who will not remember. \n\nWith family like this who needs enemies.", "First I'm so sorry for your loss. I couldn't imagine how hard that has to be for you.\n\nSecond, I have to agree that I think his whole family kinda dropped the ball on what to do. Like you said someone could have asked him to take a walk around the block, offered somewhere to go and talk, gave him a few minutes to compose, pulled him to the side and given him some hugs, IDK something other than kicking him out.", "I totally agree with you. Like I mentioned before I lost my mom when she was in her 50's super randomly. I was 28, my dad and I were devastated. But we don't go around acting like crazy people. We both had our moments the first year, during the holidays, but we excused ourselves, had a moment and came back. We weren't going around sobbing on people and expecting strangers to hear about how she died.   \n\n\nWe both talked before going to my husbands mother day party for his mom and other ladies. We agreed we'd go and if one of us felt off, we'd leave. Same with all holidays. Just cause I'm grieving doesn't give me an excuse to ruin everyone's day.", "> But OP's friends, too?

OP did NOT handle it well at all.  And I really think OP could have scheduled the party for a different day since the loss was so fresh AND the one year old wouldn\u2019t notice.  \n\nThat said, I wonder if the brother was still an AH for hijacking the party with his own grief.  I get wanting support from family but perhaps the party was not the appropriate time and place. \n\nIt\u2019s a heartbreaking situation all around and I really feel for them.", "Thats not the problem.  The problem is \u201cMultiple times HE managed to bring up his wifes passing to my friends\u201d.     Key word being HE.   The brother isnt just sitting around sad and people are asking whats wrong.

Honestly, the kid's just there as like a guest of honour. The party is actually to celebrate the parents getting through what is one of the hardest adjustments and experiences in your adult life. They probably haven't slept for a year, have been covered in shit several times over, have had to deal with a bunch of their friends being dicks about them being less fun now, not to mention all the expenses and and stresses of trying to go back to work. The party is to say \"Hey, every day of parenthood is a thankless struggle but you did really well and your kid is healthy. Well done.\"\n\nIf you're not going to cope with that, you don't show up, and you especially don't regale the other guests with your tales of grief. But.

Yes, everyone should have been understanding, including the brother to recognize his grief was too great and raw to be at a party celebrating life, not death.  His pain is great, it has been recognized. But the birth of this child should not be recognized for his grief.

Planning the party on that day was something OP should have had the foresight to know would be a bad idea.", "I\u2019m so sick of this \u201cthe kid won\u2019t remember\u201d BS \n\nSure. But they\u2019ll feel the tension. The parents will remember (and remember the first bday is absolutely also about celebrating the parents who made it unscathed lol). \n\nProcessing grief and loss is important. But a child\u2019s birthday party isn\u2019t the place to do it when you were already offered an out.", "Right\u2026why does that make this any less valid? He needed to remove himself and ask someone to be with him", "Because there's no possibility you can even contemplate that you're wrong?\n\nI would have hoped that _you_ are kidding with that comment, but unfortunately I see no such hope.", "You don't see how the brother is in the wrong at all? I OP sucked too but the brother was being lame too.", "No, I don't imagine that the other adult guests were enjoying it, either, especially if some of them didn't even know him.  If he knew somebody there, he might have asked them to keep him company in the house.", "Yes? Grieving in inappropriate places is inappropriate after all", "Thank you. I never expected anyone else but the other person to read that, lol. \n\nYou're words mean a lot to me. There are so many little things that one could never think of without experiencing it. So many questions that can plague the mind, existential shit that goes so far deeper than my brain ever expected to take me, and even though it's been 15 years, there are still times I realize the impact it had on me in a different way.\n\nI'm so sorry for the loss of your sister. It must have been very hard for you to deal with things while also watching what your parents had to go through, big virtual hug right back, thank you for being kind to me today.", "The man can't lean on his family when his grief hits him on the first anniversary of his wife's death? What the hell is family for then?", "Exactly. In 2021 I had a baby girl who passed away at two months old on my nieces birthday. I don't go to my nieces birthday parties and start talking about my daughter who passed away. That would be so selfish and inconsiderate of people who are trying to have a celebration.", "hahaha ya so worried about appropriate. so all these showings of love for family with parties is just some show. because if you dont get the picture perfect party you want because someone died, then its ruined.\n\nwtf. seriously.", "Thank you and that is the least I can do. I know it\u2019s hard but I\u2019m so glad that through it all you have kept your compassion for others. You\u2019ll never stop missing them of course but it does get better. My parents were distraught for a solid ten years and then every year after got better and better. My mom worked on being grateful and she\u2019s a completely different person for the better even prior to our loss. She\u2019s a real inspiration and found a lot of joy in life. My dad passed about ten years ago but he did the same. He was one funny mofo and found joy in making others laugh. I can tell by this short encounter you are similar to them and it\u2019s really nice to see."]}
