It's generally not ok to yell obscenities at someone, but NTA. She is an adult attacking a child. I'm sorry you have to deal with that kind BS. And as one of your caregivers, she is supposed to offer you CARE, not destroy your sense of self. I hope you protect yourself from her and go wake your dad up because he's sleeping on the job.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds rough to be with. Why does she think it is a fake diagnosis? She\u2019s been in your life for at least 10 years. She would have gone through the medical hoops to get a diagnosis, right?", "NTA.", "NTA. I mean yeah, try not to blow up at people, but a 41-year-old parent should be able to demonstrate greater self-control, patience, and understanding than their 16-year-old child.", "absolutely NTA. I grew up pretty similarly. I hear that living with and understanding a neurodivergent teen, whether your own or someone else's, is often challenging. It sounds like you've heard about that as well, and I hope you also understand that that your brain chemistry in no way gives her or anyone else the right to treat you with such disregard or baseline skepticism or speak to you so abusively. Please do not let those words or others like them define your self image.", "NTA because she is the adult and said rude things just to hurt you, she should know and behave better.  Although you responded in kind, it sounds like an accurate description of how she was acting.\n\nFrom whom have you been getting backlash?  Her?  Your father?  What does your mother think? What was your fight about? She has been critical and unsupportive of you for 5 years now.  Sounds like some family counseling is long overdue.", "NTA\n\nPerhaps her school principal needs to know what she thinks of the kids that she's working with.  She shouldn't be working with disabilities in the education system.\n\nYour stepmom is not very nice.  \n\nWhat does your dad think? I suspect he let's his wife decide seeing as she's the one driving the outings with just the three of them and excluding you.  That's him enabling her.\n\nCan you go live with your mom or grandmother?", "NTA! Talk to an adult who might help you with this situation. She should not be allowed to treat you that way. Your dad should be standing up for you and I\u2019m sorry that he clearly hasn\u2019t been.", "NTA. Can you go stay with your grandma", "ESH. Excluding you from vacations and making you feel like your caregiver is interested in forming memories that do not include you is not ok. Cant speak to the accusation of faking medical stuff. Assuming you are in the US or Canada, our medical systems regularly misdiagnose teenagers and can directly cause manifestations of mental challenges through over medication or counter productive coaching. \n\nBut its also not helpful to blow up at someone, or lean into the confrontation. Generally when someone asks \u201cyou want to know what i think about you?\u201d The answer should be \u201cNo\u201d. \n\nAnd ultimately being 16 is hard. You will learn how to better handle interpersonal issues as you grow. If things get real heated, look to be the bigger person. In two years you\u2019ll have much more agency and will be able to control you interactions with her better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People on this subreddit are nuts when it comes to comments they disagree with.\n\nI understand the point you're making - that it's important to seek the higher path and de-escalate rather than feeding in to an argument. Broadly speaking, this is the right choice. In this case, I think OP needed to stand up for herself and speak her mind in order to prove she's willing to do it. This isn't an argument over whose turn it is to do the dishes or the state of the bathroom. She's getting bullied by her own guardian. She's been gradually marginalized within her own family. Her very credibility is being attacked. What do you think happens if she lets her stepmother claim her diagnosis is a sham and she's just faking it? Do you think it will just end there?

People don't really understand that on AITA you're only supposed to downvote comments that are off topic, contribute nothing or are abusive. when people downvote comments that state an opinion that differs from their own, all they're really doing is discouraging discussion.\n\nIn my teens and early 20s i was counseled in DBT. It's served me well throughout my life, and i was eventually - after fighting for my right to be heard - able to use those tools to repair my relationships with the family members who bullied and abused me. Still, I have had to learn on my own that nobody who demonstrates a genuine lack of trust or respect for me - such as by insinuating that i'm faking a documented mental illness - is going to listen to an \"I\" statement. In the face of their own feelings and perspective, my own simply do not matter unless they're faced with a significant inconvenience for not considering them. Verbal intimidation, demeaning and mocking are tools too useful and powerful for some people to put away just because someone else is trying to de-escalate. Stepmom is in a position of power over OP, and she is definitely a bully. She doesn't have to play nice, so she won't even if OP does everything she can to facilitate it. It will never afford her real respect. Every time she fidgets, every time she fails to make eye contact, every time her mere existence is inconvenient to her stepmom, she will be abused for it, because believing that these behaviors invite abuse is easier, more self-righteous and more rewarding for that woman than examining her horrific behavior towards her dependent. Only after OP stands up for herself - repeatedly, consequentially, unequivocally -  or her father stands up for her, will it even enter stepmom's mind that her gameplan of gaslighting and bullying her own teenage stepdaughter into either looking neurotypical or killing herself isn't the optimal form of their relationship."]}
