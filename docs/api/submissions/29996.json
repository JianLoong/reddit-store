You've done the right thing by setting these boundaries. Helping out your family to cover expenses for essentials is one thing but by the sounds of it, they've been using money frivolously. You work hard for your money and yes, you can help out your family. But they can't expect you to be sending them money for expenses on non-essentials...expenses that they could easily curb. This is one of those situations where you have to put your foot down. As a 27 YO, I expect that you're also trying to save money for yourself and your family needs to understand that as well.", "NTA\n\nBut I am not speaking from your culture.  So the people around you, whose opinion matters more than mine, may see this differently.  I would suggest that you need to at least stop being so conservative with your own money.  Saving is great. Please do that and make it something that you never allow anyone else to touch, this is for you and only you.  Then spend more on your own self, pamper yourself a little.  Then, look at your finances and help your family from what is left.  This way your neighbors and family won't look down on you.  Like pay your bills and food, then divide your money out in thirds, what you spend on you, what you save for rainy day, what you give to family.  This way you no longer feel to taken advantage of and you can honestly tell people this is all the money I have to give you.", "I'm an american so NTA. I think this stuff should generally flow down. Your parents chose to have children so it's their obligation to support them up to adulthood and it's nice if they can help with college too. The children should build up their lives, careers and finances so if they decide to have children, they can provide for them. \n\nBut this complicates things:\n\n> Please note that I come from a society where sacrificing your entire life for your family is considered normal.

I would have set the same boundary you did but I hope you're not shunned or something. And if you do help them, maybe buy groceries or pay a utility bill instead of giving them cash.", "NTA\n\nYour family members are using historical cultural expectations to guilt you into paying for the fact that they choose not to work and/or overspend.  Stop funding these demands for cash.\n\nYour brother is old enough to work and budget his own spending money.  And your parents need to live within their means.\n\nIf you wish to meet expectations for financially supporting your family, make that support a set amount of your monthly budget that you can afford.  And then pay that amount directly to one of your parents' bills.  For instance, it might be reasonable to pay $100 per month to your parents' electricity account to help make sure they have heat and lights.\n\nAs your parents become older and infirm, they may need more help.  But they aren't elderly and infirm yet.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nHow could you even post this? HOW COULD YOU EVEN CONSIDER THAT YOU COULD BE THE ASSHOLE? They're upset that you're not a free ATM.

If you want to continue to help them because of the societal expectations, perhaps you could structure your financial assistance in this way- pay whatever utilities and monthly expenses like rent or insurance DIRECTLY to the provider. That way there's no skimming off the top. Once you've established that basic needs will be met, your obligation is fulfilled. If your family pouts or demands extra money for this or for that, you can let them know there is no more available money and you require gratitude, not guilt trips or they can learn to support themselves entirely. \n\nAlso- I would only feel obligated to support my parents. You're making your way in the world like your brother is, so why isn't he contributing to them? Don't take him on as a burden at all.", "NTA Admittedly speaking from another culture: why are you the only one who has this pressure and shame? What would happen if you shamed your other family members for doing nothing for each other or you? What if you did it publicly? Are they just more brash and shameless than you? They seem to sacrifice nothing. But WHY is it a shame for you to not give up everything while they give nothing? If they say, you don't care because you don't pay, what would happen if you repeated the exact same phrase back to them?"]}
