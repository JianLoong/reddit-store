You've done the right thing by setting these boundaries. Helping out your family to cover expenses for essentials is one thing but by the sounds of it, they've been using money frivolously. You work hard for your money and yes, you can help out your family. But they can't expect you to be sending them money for expenses on non-essentials...expenses that they could easily curb. This is one of those situations where you have to put your foot down. As a 27 YO, I expect that you're also trying to save money for yourself and your family needs to understand that as well.", "NTA\n\nBut I am not speaking from your culture.  So the people around you, whose opinion matters more than mine, may see this differently.  I would suggest that you need to at least stop being so conservative with your own money.  Saving is great. Please do that and make it something that you never allow anyone else to touch, this is for you and only you.  Then spend more on your own self, pamper yourself a little.  Then, look at your finances and help your family from what is left.  This way your neighbors and family won't look down on you.  Like pay your bills and food, then divide your money out in thirds, what you spend on you, what you save for rainy day, what you give to family.  This way you no longer feel to taken advantage of and you can honestly tell people this is all the money I have to give you.", "I'm an american so NTA. I think this stuff should generally flow down. Your parents chose to have children so it's their obligation to support them up to adulthood and it's nice if they can help with college too. The children should build up their lives, careers and finances so if they decide to have children, they can provide for them. \n\nBut this complicates things:\n\n> Please note that I come from a society where sacrificing your entire life for your family is considered normal.

I would have set the same boundary you did but I hope you're not shunned or something. And if you do help them, maybe buy groceries or pay a utility bill instead of giving them cash.", "NTA\n\nYour family members are using historical cultural expectations to guilt you into paying for the fact that they choose not to work and/or overspend.  Stop funding these demands for cash.\n\nYour brother is old enough to work and budget his own spending money.  And your parents need to live within their means.\n\nIf you wish to meet expectations for financially supporting your family, make that support a set amount of your monthly budget that you can afford.  And then pay that amount directly to one of your parents' bills.  For instance, it might be reasonable to pay $100 per month to your parents' electricity account to help make sure they have heat and lights.\n\nAs your parents become older and infirm, they may need more help.  But they aren't elderly and infirm yet.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nHow could you even post this? HOW COULD YOU EVEN CONSIDER THAT YOU COULD BE THE ASSHOLE? They're upset that you're not a free ATM.

In my society, your father is the one to be shamed for spending all his money on god knows what and then demanding money from his own daughter. What a scoundrel! Stick to your guns and don't feed these parasites any longer.", "NTA. If you want to continue to help them because of the societal expectations, perhaps you could structure your financial assistance in this way- pay whatever utilities and monthly expenses like rent or insurance DIRECTLY to the provider. That way there's no skimming off the top. Once you've established that basic needs will be met, your obligation is fulfilled. If your family pouts or demands extra money for this or for that, you can let them know there is no more available money and you require gratitude, not guilt trips or they can learn to support themselves entirely. \n\nAlso- I would only feel obligated to support my parents. You're making your way in the world like your brother is, so why isn't he contributing to them? Don't take him on as a burden at all.", "NTA Admittedly speaking from another culture: why are you the only one who has this pressure and shame? What would happen if you shamed your other family members for doing nothing for each other or you? What if you did it publicly? Are they just more brash and shameless than you? They seem to sacrifice nothing. But WHY is it a shame for you to not give up everything while they give nothing?

OP, I have elderly parents. Elderly. They both have part time jobs to add to what they have saved and to keep busy. I have a savings account set aside for them with the small amount of money I know I can dedicate every month and they know it\u2019s there if they need it. They tap it when they have to decide to buy a new hot water heater vs repair the current one, not to go to dinner or buy a purse. Do that instead. Drop it in an account and file it out for legit expenses as needed and when it\u2019s empty? Sorry. If your family is responsible, it works great. And leave it in account in your name, not theirs.", "NTA. OP, your family is out of control with their financial demands on you. They sound like spoiled children demanding unlimited candy. As the one with the money, it\u2019s up to you to set up a system where you can fulfill what you and your family regard as familial responsibilities but not let their unceasing and inconsiderate demands suck you dry.  You may feel you are going against all the conditioning you have received over your life time but there is a corollary to the Golden Rule that you should think about *a lot* :  **He who has the gold makes the rules.**", "NTA\n\n\nGet out!!\nMove!!\n\n\nCut financial ties. You are not responsible for your parents financial situation. And your brother can step up for a change . I would honestly save up. Apply for a job in another city and just leave with just a note telling them bye and to sort themselves out. Do not feel guilty for wanting a life of your own\n\n\nLet me lay it out for you because I understand this vicious cycle that a lot of families do to their kids. You are going to be supporting your parents till they die. At which time you will be much older and have no savings of your own, then it will be your kids turn to support you.. it's the circle of financial burden that won't end unless you make it! Should you ever have kids ,do you really want to be as reliant on them as your parents are on you?? If it was for actual necessities I would say help them, but they are asking for wants, not needs!. And you will never know what the money is really for, when they are so obviously ok with lying to you. Leave and get yourself out of this financial pit of their own making. I wish you luck . Don't be afraid to start new! And anyone who thinks less of you, can help them with their finances. Escape and live your best life \ud83c\udf3b", "NTA look I don't know your culture but I do know a lot about respect and your family have 0 for you which is heartbreaking this ends today do not give them a single cent. It doesn't matter what everyone else thinks of you its only what you think of yourself and everyone here will tell you that you are doing the right thing by stop giving them money. I promise you the only reason they contact you is for money you not an atm  you are a daughter and somebody's sister and I am sorry that they don't treat you that way. I am on your side and so is everyone else here. You work hard for your money you earned it so you should get the rewards for it I am proud that your being careful but its time that you need to put yourself first go on a spa day and treat yourself. You did not work this hard to just hand over money your family will bleed you dry and it will never be enough they are all adults and it's time to figure there lives out please look after yourself and treat yourself even go an amazing vacation there is a beautiful big world out there just waiting for us all to go and see it \ud83d\ude0a\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nThey are not on the streets, they are wasting the money they earn, because they know you'll give them more.  \n\nDon't put yourself in the poor house to give them luxuries.", "NTA any culture that has a social aspect that makes living unbearable for you is a culture to run away from and practice in another country with the parts you can embrace as a part of you.", "Write out a budget for yourself and always remember to pay your savings first. \n\nIf you feel socially or culturally compelled to contribute to your families living situation, only do it by paying specific bills like water and electric directly and don't give them cash to squander on drinking \nor shopping addictions.\n\nIf they complain, just tell them you don't have any extra in your budget right now. When you do feel like you want to give them extra always say you got it from a bonus or you worked extra overtime to get this money so they don't get the idea that you always have room in your budget to give them extra", "Since your brother has relocated to a new city, I assume he has finished college and has moved for a new job. Therefore, any money your parents requests for him is likely a ruse and will probably just be money they keep. He will be making money so should be able to contribute but will most likely refuse since he has been spoiled for years. You will continue to be the easy mark. As others have suggested, you must set up a system of savings for yourself, money to spend on yourself now for necessities and occasional splurges (a new purse) and a strict allowance for them. Give them no access to your accounts. If they scream and yell, tell them to ask their son for money.\n\nIf it becomes unbearable, you CAN break with tradition. Yes, you can. Your father can support his wife. He is still young. You can move out. You can more than support yourself. Find a cousin willing to break with tradition and share an apartment. Yes, your mother will badmouth you. Some of those people will admire you for not caving to your drunkard father. You are not going to pass this tradition on to your children are you? Your children will be proud of you for not letting them browbeat you and having the strength to say, NO! Enough! Be strong and good luck!", "NTA go no contact with them.", "This...and move out.", "This is a good budget plan."]}
