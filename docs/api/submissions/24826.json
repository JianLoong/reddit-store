Recently we adopted a two year old baby girl. Everyone except my husband, 46m, is telling me that I made the wrong choice.\n\nThis all started when one of my close friends, 41f, had a surprise baby a couple years ago. Every other kid in the friend group is much older, and this new baby is just so sweet. She\u2019s so easy too, nothing like my kids as babies. She gave me serious baby fever, and my husband agreed he wanted to have another one. \n\nSince I'm already in my forties, I decided against having one naturally. Adoption was the obvious choice. We brought her home three months ago. My children hate their new sister. They've been acting out a lot and very closed off since she joined our family. They just can\u2019t get along. They would rather hide in their rooms with their cousins and avoid us.\n\nMy daughter even told me I'm abandoning the family \u201cfor something new and shiny\u201d, but she's just being a moody teenager. I haven\u2019t abandoned them at all, they have everything they could ever want. She even threatened to move in with my brother. I told her to go ahead and it shut her up pretty quick, but now she isn\u2019t talking to me. \n\nMy friend who spurred this whole thing told me that I won't be a good mom at this age and just want a baby, not another child. We got into a big argument about it. There\u2019s less of an age gap between my kids and the baby vs her kids and new baby. It\u2019s just hypocritical coming from someone who had kids as a teenager and barely took care of them. And even if she\u2019s right, that's not her call to make. I thought she would be happy her kid has a built in best friend friend now.\n\nI think my friend and daughter are being ridiculous. We have plenty of resources so the baby is taken care of. If anyone is abandoning the family, it\u2019s the one who wants to leave because we opened our hearts to love another child.

Babies don\u2019t stay \u201ceasy\u201d babies forever, they turn into children that form their own thoughts and ideas just like your 13 and 15 year old.

How much are you going to expect your daughter to take care of that baby?  Both of your daughters will resent you for that.", "YTA, but good job on raising a daughter mature enough to candidly spot what you're doing. Hopefully you taught her, without realizing it, that its useless to say that kind of thing to the person you think it about though.", "YTA. You write a lot about your wishes to have another child, but when it comes to adoption the needs of an adopted child should be the number one priority. One of these needs is to be placed in a loving home and environment. Adoption comes with a price for everyone involved. That includes trauma even for very young children or even newborns. If an adopted kid feels rejected by their siblings this can lead to a much deeper hurt then a biological sibling or half-sibling would feel. \n\nYou made a mistake by not including and preparing your kids enough in the process of adoption. You need family therapy to navigate those conflicts in your family.

We went to Court and became his legal guardians.  After two years (when we realized this was not short term) we did the same thing with the then 7F.  I am now a 58 year old widow.  My youngest (the baby boy) is now 16.  I am raising him alone.  However, my oldest two help out so much.  He doesn't like learning to drive with me (that was always Dad's job), so the older kids and their spouses are taking that on.  When I get frustrated or overwhelmed they provide me feedback and support.  They love the younger two and consider them full siblings despite me never being allowed to legally adopt them.
