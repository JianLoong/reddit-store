Recently we adopted a two year old baby girl. Everyone except my husband, 46m, is telling me that I made the wrong choice.\n\nThis all started when one of my close friends, 41f, had a surprise baby a couple years ago. Every other kid in the friend group is much older, and this new baby is just so sweet. She\u2019s so easy too, nothing like my kids as babies. She gave me serious baby fever, and my husband agreed he wanted to have another one. \n\nSince I'm already in my forties, I decided against having one naturally. Adoption was the obvious choice. We brought her home three months ago. My children hate their new sister. They've been acting out a lot and very closed off since she joined our family. They just can\u2019t get along. They would rather hide in their rooms with their cousins and avoid us.\n\nMy daughter even told me I'm abandoning the family \u201cfor something new and shiny\u201d, but she's just being a moody teenager. I haven\u2019t abandoned them at all, they have everything they could ever want. She even threatened to move in with my brother. I told her to go ahead and it shut her up pretty quick, but now she isn\u2019t talking to me. \n\nMy friend who spurred this whole thing told me that I won't be a good mom at this age and just want a baby, not another child. We got into a big argument about it. There\u2019s less of an age gap between my kids and the baby vs her kids and new baby. It\u2019s just hypocritical coming from someone who had kids as a teenager and barely took care of them. And even if she\u2019s right, that's not her call to make. I thought she would be happy her kid has a built in best friend friend now.\n\nI think my friend and daughter are being ridiculous. We have plenty of resources so the baby is taken care of.

Babies don\u2019t stay \u201ceasy\u201d babies forever, they turn into children that form their own thoughts and ideas just like your 13 and 15 year old.

How much are you going to expect your daughter to take care of that baby?  Both of your daughters will resent you for that.", "YTA, but good job on raising a daughter mature enough to candidly spot what you're doing. Hopefully you taught her, without realizing it, that its useless to say that kind of thing to the person you think it about though.", "YTA. You write a lot about your wishes to have another child, but when it comes to adoption the needs of an adopted child should be the number one priority. One of these needs is to be placed in a loving home and environment. Adoption comes with a price for everyone involved. That includes trauma even for very young children or even newborns. If an adopted kid feels rejected by their siblings this can lead to a much deeper hurt then a biological sibling or half-sibling would feel. \n\nYou made a mistake by not including and preparing your kids enough in the process of adoption. You need family therapy to navigate those conflicts in your family.

You don't get to control how they act, and your children's coldness to your toddler is entirely your fault. Go ahead and have your baby, but don't be surprised if they stop speaking to you when they're older. \n\nYou and your husband didn't think of your children when you made this decision. You're extremely selfish and I feel so terrible for your children. They deserve parents who care about their needs and feelings, not ones who essentially replaced them now that they're not adorable little babies.

Are you talking about having/adopting a child or a friend who planned a bad vacation that you didn\u2019t have fun on?", "I mean, the fact that it's also a person who thinks you can just go snag a baby through adoption on a whim also points to it being fake.", "Sounds like it was written by AI.", "It\u2019s definitely fake. NO ONE who has ever had a child would adopt a TODDLER bc of baby fever. Two year olds are absolute menaces.

My parent's were 40 when they adopted us and I wouldn't have traded them for ANY of my friend's parents who were 20 years younger.  I swear it kept my parents younger. They were more patient and established financially.", "There's no need to be ageist asf. My parents were in their early 40s when I was adopted, and are still kicking and I'm in my 30s. Hell, my mom ran a 5k last weekend.\n\nI do think she should have cleared this with her kids before adopting a child, though.", "Yes. My mother died , at 56 when I was 17. Age doesn\u2019t mean anything when it comes to being a mother. Now having kids at that age is entirely different. Either way, she using this baby because her friend had one and abandoned hers because they\u2019re moody teenagers. Poor baby, she\u2019s gonna get dropped too at 14 probably.", "I'd argue that the friend isn't necessarily being toxic and can just see through her bs, that she adopted a baby just because the friend has one. Also not that the kid won't be loved, but she clearly did not adopt it out of concern or love, she just wanted it.", "OP telling them to move out is basically confirming they thoughts of losing something. \nOP should listen to their concerns and tell them they are not losing anything and be kind to them and understanding.

Adoption should always be about the best interest of the child, not you.

It seems like this happened very quickly", "Did you ask them about it or just inform them?", "Ah, I just shared my adoption story. Parents were 40 and back in the 60s normal agencies would not adopt out to parents over 35.  They ended up going private.

You did not involve them at all with this decision, yet you expect them to warm to a random two year old they now have to share a house with.

Your husband is the only one that agrees with you because he was probably fed up with you talking about another baby. \n\nI'm usually easy with people going through that moments of their lifes, but you're actively destroying the self-confidence of your teenagers to fullfill your selfish desires. You're also destroying this baby's life by adopting her for all the wrong reasons. She's not a prop, not your friend's child bestie. It sounds like you were jealous of your friend for being a mom at her age and you wanted the attention. \n\nGo to therapy because you have a lot of work to do.", "Have you ever seen a teenager who loves babies? You kinda act like you got a new puppy not a whole human.
