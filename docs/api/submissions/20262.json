After he told us he didn\u2019t believe in God, we had him come to church for a few months until we could work out a plan for him to have him watched while the rest of our family was at church. He said that he was old enough to be left home alone, but we did not agree with that; he almost accidentally burned down our shed a few months prior. Eventually we came to the agreement that he could be left alone, but we had the neighbor keep watch on the house.

He claimed that forcing him to come to church was \"abusive\" even though it was only temporary\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHis resentment grew more due to our financial situation. The kids always had everything they needed and could join any club they wanted, but we did not have the same luxuries others had. We never went on big trips and Christmas and birthday gifts were usually small \\~$75. We would give a smaller religious gift to the other children every Christmas and Easter, but he would refuse it. He would argue that we should give him cash instead, and my wife would sometimes because she didn\u2019t like arguing. We also couldn't afford college funds.

Speaking as an atheist, you\u2019re uninviting your asshole son, not your atheist son. He obviously doesn\u2019t agree with the trip and would ruin it for everyone else, so it\u2019s fair to exclude him.", "NTA. He's 26 and not entitled to a trip, and certainly not a trip where he's going to belittle you the entire time. I hope he enjoys Japan with his own money.", "NTA, but not because he's an atheist, but because he's an asshole. \n\nIt's okay to not believe but he's being a total shit about it. There's nothing stopping him from being respectful. \n\nI'm not a believer but free trip to Israel? I'll traipse through any church/temple/crypt ya got.", "NtA. Regardless him being an atheist. He seems to show he won\u2019t be enjoying the trip. You don\u2019t have to be a Christian to enjoy the trip , just being in a different country with different culture is enough to be excited even without the religion side of it. I\u2019m a. Christian but I enjoy visiting temples and mosques and enjoy their beauty and history and being respectful of the culture and beliefs. Imagine if he\u2019s in Israel and make insulting remarks on the holy sites during the trip with other tourists. You all might get into trouble with other tourists or even officials . Leave him be and enjoy the trip. Don\u2019t let him ruin a beautiful trip.", "NTA, it didn\u2019t sound like he had any interest in going to Israel and it seems like he would just drag everyone down the whole trip anyways. I\u2019m atheist and respect anyone\u2019s beliefs, doesn\u2019t seem like your son does. At least not yours.", "NTA\n\nIf you are invited to the trip that was payed for by your parents (if I got it right) and this trip is important to them you either accept it but keep your mouth shut or you simply refuse it.\n\nYou can't just go and be so mean and nasty all the time.\n\nYou did the right thing", "NTA - I\u2019m an atheist too but would never try to discredit/criticize someone else\u2019s beliefs. You deserve to enjoy your trip and if at 26 he hasn\u2019t learned that religion is a deeply personal thing and you should keep your opinions to yourself then he\u2019s the AH.", "NTA\n\nNot wanting to leave a 13 year old who recently burned down a shed at home alone is valid. It sounds like you were open to him not coming to church pretty quickly.\n\nAlso although he is 26, you were willing to pay for a trip for him. He is being very disrespectful and seems determined to ruin a long-awaited and long saved for family holiday.\n\nI know it is hard to have different religious convictions than one's family. (Been there, done that. My fatheris quite religious.)  But it can be handled with respect.  Your son sounds very rude.", "NTA\n\nIt's a religious trip about religion and all he has to do is keep his opinions to himself. Being so opposed that you cant drop the topic but not so opposed you wont turn down a free trip is smarmy as heck.\n\nOn a much smaller scale, if everyone was planning a trip to see their favorite band and someone in the party refuses to stop talking about how much that band sucks, I would uninvite them as well", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t believe, so why would he go?  It sounds like he would just ruin everyone else\u2019s trip.", "Atheist here and NTA.  He would ruin the trip. And you didn't abuse him by taking him to church for 2 months because he had previously burned the shed.....", "Not the Asshole.\n\nHe *WAS* invited, but he chose to express his extreme disinterest in the trip and then mocked what would be a very special trip for the rest of the family. He disinvited himself. He is also a 26 year old grown man, it's not like you have an obligation to bring him along and ensure his well-being at this stage in his life.\n\nDon't let him ruin the trip for the rest of the family.", "NTA - considering he was being so negative and critical about trip.  He would have likely ruined it.", "NTA - I am not overly religious. I believe everyone had the right to follow any religion they want\u2026or in your son\u2019s case not. But this trip is about visiting sites that are important to your religion. Your  son will not enjoy it and he should not go. I don\u2019t even know why he want to go on this trip-unless he wants to belittle your faith.", "NTA for this specific situation.\n\nIt sounds like this is going to be a very religious trip and he most likely wouldn\u2019t enjoy it, or at least spend the time lecturing you all, so it makes sense to me that you wouldn\u2019t bring him.\n\nBut I can\u2019t help but think that you may have been an AH in other ways and I\u2019d be really interested to hear Jake\u2019s views on the family dynamic. For example, giving the kids extra religious gifts and making Jake either accept that gift or be left out strikes me as an issue.", "NTA,  he clearly doesn't want to go", "NTA.  There is plenty of historical value in the places you are planning to visit, aside from their importance in your religion.  It doesn't sound like you disinvited him because he is an atheist - you disinvited him because he is dismissive of your beliefs and he obviously doesn't want to go.", "NTA,\n\nBruh\u2026he was upset the neighbor kept tabs on him? You burned a shed, I\u2019m honestly surprised you still left him alone . But I get the situation and not wanting to force things on him.\n\nCanceling his ticket was the best thing you could\u2019ve done. He wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed it, he would\u2019ve criticized things and make the trip worse for everyone. He\u2019s an adult, he chose this and can\u2019t be upset that his toxic behavior as led for his outcome. Sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "NTA, you are right to cancel his ticket. He would make the rest of the family unhappy with his comments. You get to choose who goes on the trip that you are paying for. He is learning there are consequences for his actions. \nThat being said, offering a religious gift to him at Christmas and Easter is disrespectful of his beliefs. Why couldn\u2019t you get him a gift the same price that was not religious? It is like you are punishing him for his choice and beliefs. No wonder he is resentful. Don\u2019t be surprised if he goes NC or LC with you in the future.", ">I can\u2019t see how to have an enjoyable trip with him there\n\nHe sounds like he has issues and there's no need to bring an AH on a trip he doesn't want to go on anyway. Leave him with a sitter, enjoy your trip.", "NTA - I was surprised when I read that you actually had bought him a plane ticket to begin with since it was a religious trip. I mean obviously there are other things to do there and he could have done those, and he could have been doing those thing if he wasn't such an AH. Basically I feel like this was a don't bite the hand that feeds you situation. You didn't exclude him from this family trip but at the same time you don't want to be miserable. He could have went if he just left his repeated comments about your religion to himself.", "NTA. I don\u2019t see why someone who consistently criticises the religion and has also made offensive comments about the pilgrimage, should even want to come? Maybe it\u2019s FOMO from his side. Whatever it is, I wouldn\u2019t want him there either. You mentioned saving up over the decade so I will assume he\u2019s at least 20yrs old by this stage so therefore, leaving him behind isn\u2019t a bad option in my book. He said he doesn\u2019t enjoy church or the religion and that\u2019s fine, no need to come on the trip!", "Nta. You didn't uninvite him because he is an atheist - if that had been the case you never would have invited him in the first place. You aren't taking him because he's behaving like a jackass. Why would he even want to go on a trip to places important to a religion that he ridicules?", "NTA.  He has no interest in the trip as planned.  So he shouldn't go.  My father and my stepmother asked if I was interested in perhaps accompanying them on a pilgrimage trip in Spain and Portugal.  It was obvious from the question that they'd pay.  I told them no, no thanks, have a great time because I am not interested in a Catholic pilgrimage to multiple holy sites.  Simple.  Done. \n\nHe wants to go to Japan?  Great!  He can start saving for that.", "NTA I was in your sons shoes, I became agnostic at 15 while my parents are both catholic. I still go church with them on special occasions, like Christmas, Easter, and certain holidays because I know it makes my parents happy. They are of course disappointed but, let me live my life. Your son seems like a butthole", "Just from the perspective of an extremely ardent atheist... NTA\n\nYour son has some serious issues and needs to get a grip. Respect works both ways, and he appears to have none.\n\nP.s. I've been to Israel, and it's beautiful.", "NTA. He would be resentful whether you brought him on the trip or not. It's an unfortunate situation. It sounds like you managed it the best you could given how strongly he disagrees with you while being a minor.", "NTA he can go to Japan on his own dollar! Go enjoy your pilgrimage!", "Do you pay into the church at all? Asking since if they can give children scholarships they must have the money from somewhere some presuming regular donations from the community", "I need more INFO. I'm worried you're leaving out some reasons that he might be so angry. Did something happen at the church? Are you guys homophobic or transphobic or something? How does the church talk about atheists? What exactly is he so mad about?", "NTA. For what it's worth, this is from someone who finds Christians to be among the most harmful and dangerous people in America. Your trip is religious in nature. He is not religious. And he will just bring everyone down with his criticisms on the trip.", "NTA.\n\nJake wasn\u2019t uninvited because he\u2019s an atheist. Jake was uninvited because he\u2019s an AH who would make the trip absolutely *miserable* for you and the rest of your family.\n\n>> Our extended family has urged us to re-invite him\n\nCool, how much are they paying towards his flight and lodging? If they\u2019re so adamant that you bring Jake along so he can terrorize you, your family, and likely anyone & everyone he encounters in Israel, *surely* they\u2019re fine with footing the bill. If not, they can keep their opinions to themselves\n\nEdit: a word", "Nope NTA.\n\nHe was fully invited until he was actively ruining the fun.\nHis attitude is the problem, and religion is a small factor  in this story imho.", "You\u2019re not excluding him because he\u2019s an atheist, you\u2019re excluding him because he\u2019s being a belligerent asshole NTA", "Nope NTA. Hopefully he will uninvite himself to future gatherings.", "NTA. I\u2019m an atheist and honestly, your son sounds like the worst kind of atheist, who uses his lack of belief to belittle others. I can see why he\u2019d be salty about not getting a scholarship, but them\u2019s the breaks, frankly. And your explanation for why you kept taking him to church for a while seems reasonable. Constantly sniping and sledging the trip you\u2019re going on is pretty pathetic on his part and getting left behind is an entirely reasonable response.\n\nBasically, he f*cked around and found out. He\u2019s only got himself to blame.", "Yta for going to Israel and supporting an apartheid state. I don't understand how you see yourself as a Christian and support the murder of innocent people. Perhaps you should listen to what your son is saying", "NTA, but honestly, why would he want to go with you?  It sounds miserable. If you\u2019re not religious, why would you want to join a religious group making a religious pilgrimage to see religious sites?\n\nI mean, I think everything he said is right. But he also just sounds like a brat. You did raise him, though, so I guess some of that is on you.", "ESH. People act like teens who ask to do their own thing don\u2019t know any better or whatever, but 13 is old enough to decide if he believes in something or not. You still forced your religion on your son by making him go to church when he didn\u2019t want to and treating him like he was a baby while still growing up in a religious house. And if you\u2019ve been saving for a trip for so many years, how come you chose a trip over your son\u2019s education? If you can\u2019t see how that treatment helped shape who he was, then that\u2019s on you. I do think his mocking was 100% wrong, and he should have been grateful for a trip to another country. He didn\u2019t have to participate in the religious aspects but could have done something on his own. Still, it\u2019s no wonder he acted the way he did. \n\nI also don\u2019t believe that anyone should be entitled to other peoples money, but to makes promises of a trip only to have him be the only one uninvited was mean. Instead of talking to him about it or sit down and have a heart to heart, you probably made your son feel that you once again put religion over family.", "ESH. Neither of you are respecting the others' right to believe differently, though I understand him wanting to push back against a religion that tells him that he is not allowed to believe differently and \"go to Heaven.\" Jake is a second class citizen in your home due to his beliefs, and he hates that and pushes back against it, understandably. \n\n\\*You should definitely have given him a cash equivalent of the religious gifts you gave the other children. \n\n\\*He needs to stop tearing down your vacation if he wants to go.", "YTA. Religious fanatics are hateful people, you can't see past your own self interest to support your child. He will hold this against you for the rest of his life, you will not be invited to his major life events because you clearly do not hold him in your heart.\n\nNothing could be more important to me than what my daughter finds valuable. All the things my dead parents left me I would sooner throw in the trash if it wasn't important to her and I would find something new to share with her and make it worth the memory just to keep her close. Religion is a thought, an idea, a preference. If it became important to her when she's older I wouldn't care if I did or didn't believe in it I would support her. I couldn't imagine planning a family trip and **uninvite** her from it how fucked is that.\n\nMy point is whatever god you ascribe to thinks YTA for sidelining your kid who is clearly rebelling because you're not listening to what he has to say.", "He wasn\u2019t old enough to be home alone at age 13? \n\nWhat?", "YTA. I dont even give a crap about your question.\n\nYou couldn't \"afford\" to give him gifts or help with college but you were able to save up enough to pay for everyone in your family to go on your religious trip. Apparently this overlaps with the time you started saving for it. He was 16 when you started to save, yet you couldn't help your son? \ud83e\udd14", "YTA because Isreal is participating in a mass genocide against the moslim people.

I get his a pain in the ass but he\u2019s exploring his own spirituality. He does not approve of the religion you practice and that\u2019s ok. If you want to avoid further resentments in the future, you\u2019re going to have to figure out how to accept someone in your family that has their own personal beliefs different to yours.", "Yta. Not bc of the trip. But just like. How you've treated him and how y'all are as people and a family. Gross.", "Esh", "YTA", "ESH, your son is being disrespectful towards your beliefs and sounds extremely immature, but excluding him from something like a family trip isn\u2019t going to help either, maybe you could have asked him if there was anywhere during your trip he\u2019d like to go that isn\u2019t related to religion knowing he\u2019s atheist?", "Ugh.\n\nI appreciated that you only made him go to church while you figured out other options.  He wasn\u2019t ready (hence shed burning) to be home alone.\n\nYou kinda sucked for fighting the religious gift bit when you did.\n\nWhile you view the pilgrimage as just that, I bet you did some non-religious stuff while you were there. Kid feels salty about missing those bits.\n\nKid shouldn\u2019t have been surprised he didn\u2019t get a scholarship and probably should have kept his atheism to himself to get the benefit.\n\nESH, but weighing more towards Y-T-A because I know y\u2019all did or are going to sight see.", "NTA.

You basically decided he is only worthy of gifts if he is christian, or at least that's the way he took it.

The distribution of funds is determined by a scholarship committee that consists of the church's elders and other members", "Yeah, that hit me as a lot of money for a church to be giving out. I think my church growing up has one but it was like\u2026100 bucks?", "I have deaf family members who belong to a deaf church. They get all kinds of outside money from foundations and lots of scholarships from both religious schools and deaf schools make their way through for the church \n\nIm not saying thats the case with OP but some churches got the hook up", "They curved him to attend when they didn't trust him home alone after nearly burning down a shed. Once they trusted him (2 months I think) he was allowed to stay at home alone while the rest of the family attended church.\n\nWould would OP pay for his son to attend a family vacation if the intention is the son won't participate in the plans the family has made and will instead mock them?", ">making him go to church when he didn\u2019t want to and treating him like he was a baby\n\nNot trusting him to stay home alone may have been a mistake in hindsight, but he almost killed himself and burned down the shed just a few months prior. He was very irresponsible and we did what we thought was right at the time  \n\n\n>And if you\u2019ve been saving for a trip for so many years, how come you chose a trip over your son\u2019s education\n\nOur older son was more successful getting scholarships and went to community college before continuing at university. His work ethic helped him graduate without debt. It was wrong for us to assume that that would hold for the rest of the kids. These funds started as an emergency fund, but we were able to contribute more and more after more kids started to move out. The first few years, very little was actually added to this fund. It was something my wife and I could look forward and dream of, we expected it to take much longer to actually have enough to go on this trip.", "> You still forced your religion on your son by making him go to church when he didn\u2019t want to \n\nPretty clear from OP it was just the logistical hurdle of making sure he had someone to watch him (since he wasn't responsible enough to be home alone) while the rest of the family was away.", "They made him attend until they could find someone to watch him. He had shown he wasn\u2019t responsible enough to be left there alone. \n\nAnd if they were going to put the money towards education it should have been divided evenly between all of their kids. Him being an atheist doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t have found other scholarships to earn.", "Did you skip the part where he burnt the family\u2019s shed down a couple months prior?", "It isn't as much his age as it was his maturity. He nearly burnt down the shed a few months prior and was generally reckless--which I do not blame him for, he was a kid growing up. At the time, it felt like my wife and I couldn't trust him alone so we did the best we could", "They didn\u2019t help any of their kids, so that\u2019s irrelevant. It wouldn\u2019t have been fair for them to help their son but not their other kids. Why should he get special treatment?", "the other children in the home earned their tuition. why does Jake get to spend his teen years doing nothing while the other kids were volunteering their time and earning a scholarship.\n\nhow is it fair that Jake gets a free ride while all the other kids had to work for it", "Honestly, the son sounds like a dick so why should they pay his way for anything if that's how he acts?", "Per OP\u2019s comments it started as an emergency fund and they started contributing more after the older kids moved out. There wouldn\u2019t have been much when he went to college and why should he get their money for college when his siblings didn\u2019t?", "Hi, have you heard of the crusades?", "You should read the Bible probably...", "He doesn't get to regularly criticise their religion and then join them on a pilgrimage.", "He is 26 by now, he is an adult so the spirituality exploration argument is a bit late (like 13 years late)\n\nThe argument of acceptance is working both ways. At least Jake may have shown some respect. And if he wants to keep a fine relationship he may be at least more polite in topics important for the family", "If he's not interested in the planned trip, then he has no reason to go.", "It sounded like the family did accept his decision to become an atheist. The only time he was forced to attend church was when they didn't trust him home alone due to his behavior. He wasn't forced to volunteer with the rest of his siblings.", "I don\u2019t think there is any problem in him exploring his spirituality. You do not criticise and offend others while \u201cexploring your spirituality, period. It\u2019s rude and unnecessary. Especially with family, he should find a way to coexist without being an AH. If he doubts aspects of the religion that they are going to visit, he can stay his ass at home. So far away from the religion he so clearly despises.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like they have a problem with accepting his (lack of) belief. It sounds like he\u2019s the one who won\u2019t accept their beliefs and wants to make everyone miserable on the trip to show how \u201cenlightened\u201d he is.", "YTA for this comment. \"Your Saviour\" is not mine. Your beliefs are not fact that apply to everyone. Your religious beliefs are something you were raised to believe, not an unalienable truth. Christians who act like they are the ultimate authority on religion are what turn a lot of people like OP's son away from churches in the first place.", "I think it\u2019s less about rejecting and more about not being convinced, they are entirely different things", "He doesn\u2019t believe why should he get a gift on religious holiday.", "They're celebrating Christmas and Easter as religious holidays....why would he want to participate is he's athiest.", "This was 13 years ago????", "Their son is 26 now. It sounded like OP was talking about when all the kids were still minors that they had that financial difficulty. The same thing happened with my parents; when I was younger, there were way more financial constraints, but over years of tending their finances they have been gradually able to afford nicer and nicer things as I've gotten older. OP and his wife likely saved for this trip for several years - i.e. all while this son was already an adult.", "And maybe he was acting out because of how you were treating him. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m inclined to disagree because the whole thing seems sketchy to me. But what do I know?", "Get thee behind me Satan.", "Love this comment.", "Lmaoooo isn't judging other people going against what God said \ud83d\ude02"]}
