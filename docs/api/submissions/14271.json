My stepsister (9f) was 2 at the time. My mom died and her dad bailed on her mom when she was pregnant with her and was never in her life and never paid child support or anything. When my dad and his wife married, they wanted to do a family unity ceremony which meant me and my stepsister would be standing there while vows were made to us and then (as the kid who could speak) would make a vow to always be there for her, to love her and be her big sister. I passed on that. My dad was upset. His wife was even more upset because she wanted the video to show her daughter one day, of me making those vows to her and holding her. The ceremony happened. They made the vows to us while I was sitting and she was being held by her mom. But I didn't make any vows.\n\nThere has been an expectation set that even though I didn't say the vows, that I would be the big sister my dad's wife wanted for her daughter. The vows she wrote for me say things like \"I'll always do your hair when you ask, have makeovers whenever possible, take you to the park, play dolls and climb trees with you, snuggle on the couch and always make space for you in my bed\" and that's not even the whole list of what she promised from me. But she did expect that stuff and was disappointed when I didn't. Dad pushed sometimes, but not all of the time, which I get, since he probably did want more cohesion from us and for me to make an effort to try and love her and be a sister for her.\n\nAround the age of 5 my stepsister started to get a bit more demanding with that stuff thanks to her mom and my dad a bit. She'd always want me to take her places, or always want to tag along with me, was always coming into my room, etc. It got annoying. And when I would play with her or watch a movie with her she never wanted it to end. She'd cry and whine and her mom would try to make me keep going when I would say I needed to do my own stuff now. Dad sometimes intervened but not always.\n\nA few nights ago she came into my room when I was Facetiming my aunt and said I needed to do her hair the way I did mine at night. She got into my laptop screen and tried to end the call. I had to do it myself and then when I told her I wasn't doing it for her after that she said I made vows to be her sister and was being mean by not. I told her I made no vows. She said I did and her mom showed me them. I said her mom wrote those and I never said them. She told me that wasn't true. I called her mom in and told her she needed to stop lying and tell her the truth. Dad came in and told my stepsister the three of them needed to talk. My stepsister was so upset by what I said and when it was confirmed she ran off crying to her room saying I don't love her.\n\nDad asked me if I could console her and assure her I do love her and I said I couldn't do that. So he went to comfort her. But his wife said I was an ass and should have played along to spare her daughters feelings.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680947659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fhazb/aita_for_telling_my_little_stepsister_i_didnt/", "score": 1196, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly I should have figured it would hurt her feelings to have me say that when she was so attached to the idea. By saying I didn't make them and making such a big deal out if it I really crushed her and she's young and has known me practically her whole life and wants me to be that sister she thought I promised to be.

I think it would be normal with that big age gap that the bigger sibling doesn't want play with the younger sibling all the time. And your stepmother and father have been in the wrong when they tried to force the big sister - small sister -relationship to happen. These things happen naturally if you give time and space.", "NTA - The step mother and your father have forced you into a relationship and didn't give you a choice. Your SM lied to her daughter about the vows and expects you to do all the things she wrote in those vows and now the daughter expects it too.\n\nYour dad is a AH for not bothering to defend you.", "NTA - you have been forced into a situation you don\u2019t want to be in and that\u2019s not OK. I would gently suggest you speak to someone professionally about this and also have your stepsister talk to someone separately too. At the end of the day, she\u2019s 9 years old and these interactions are going to be damaging for you both in the long run.", "NTA - I can't imagine how frustrating it must be to constantly have \"we're a family\" rammed down your throat, and forced interactions with a much, much younger unrelated person. Your Dad married your step-mum, she came with a daughter, so yes, you're technically step-sisters; however that doesn't mean you need to play into your step-mothers weird fantasy of you semi-worshipping her child. I'd stick with enforcing your own boundries, you're entitled to decide who you interact with and how that interaction looks.   \nPlus it's really not fair on you to insist a 9 year old tags along with a 16 year old. You're both at quite different stages of life and development. Your Dad continuing to allow this to happen is really just going to breed resentment the longer it goes on.", "NTA, it sounds like a tough situation to navigate and you did the best you could", "NTA. even biological sisters don't hold so many expectations for each other", "NTA. Your stepmother tried, and continues to try, to force you to be view your step sister as your sister. In doing so, she probably pushed you two apart. Your father went along with it more than he should have, but seems to have a good feel for the emotional delicacy involved. It\u2019s almost like the mother of a two year old really thought emotions stayed as simple as a two-year-old\u2019s forever. \n\nFor lying to your stepsister, and not even briefing you on the lie, your stepmother was an AH and foolish. She\u2019s TA here.", "NTA. Your stepsister is only 9 but you are only 16. You are not an adult and it\u2019s not your responsibility to build a cohesive and blended family. It was your parent\u2019s responsibility to nurture an environment that yours and your sister\u2019s relationship could grow and instead of doing that they tried to force YOU to be a certain figure for your little sister. \n\nI\u2019m from a large family and this perfect idea image of a big sister doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019m the baby in the family and my older sister wasn\u2019t expected to be any sort of figure in my life. Sometimes she would let me in her room, watch cartoons, fix my hair ect, and sometimes she wouldn\u2019t.My parents didn\u2019t teach me that I was entitled to do anything with her so I understood my sister\u2019s boundaries. There is a 9 year age gap between me and my sister.", "Your stepmom sounds selfish and annoying", "NTA.\n\nBy trying to make you commit to this list of vows that she wrote, your father's wife has done you a huge disservice.\n\nIt sounds an awful lot like she was pressuring a 9 year old child into agreeing to sign a legal document. Now I know its not a legally binding contract, but this lady was attempting to hold it over you as if it was. That is very toxic behaviour from an adult towards a child, especially a child that has lost their mother.\n\nYour father is also to blame for not ever really standing up for you. That's literally his number one job.\n\nBlended families are hard. They can be very challenging to make work successfully. But your father and his wife seem to have done a remarkably poor job at doing this. It's like they don't  understand that you're your own person, and not just someone that lives to do the whims of your younger stepsister.\n\nThey have failed you both massively.", "NTA. I\u2018d judge differently if this were an isolated incident but your stepmother is to blame most for creating the situation and your father is also an AH for letting it come this far. Sure, you could\u2019ve been less blunt but you\u2019re a teenager yourself and didn\u2019t create the issue.", "NTA. The sad thing is that maybe you\u2019d really have been sisters, but there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell with the way your stepmother pushed this.", "NTA. \n\nI cannot, cannot stress how much I hate stepparents who try to force their way (and their children\u2019s way) into relationships with their step kids. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to experience all of that for 7 years. I\u2019m sorry your dad and stepmom were so selfish they put their own desires and needs above yours.", "NTA\n\nYour  dad and stepmom are a case study in how to fuck up a blended family. They should never have lied to your stepsister or tried to force a relationship even biological sisters wouldn't conform to.", "NTA -- can you go away to college?", "You are not obliged to consider anyone's feeling who don't care for your feelings. It is incredible that her mum expected you to love her daughter and wrote so demanding vows. Good that you didn't play along. It is really mean to make a child promise anything, actually, but to be a real sister even meaner. Real sisters have boundaries, by the way...\n\nShe is responsible her child's mental balance, not you. \n\nNTA", "It kinda sounds like your stepmom has been eyeing you off as a free nanny since you were 9?

Your dad should be protecting you from this insane, coercive shit.\n\nI'd try and get your dad on his own, a day out somewhere, and confess how your feeling but get those waterworks going and really lay it on thick. He sounds weak as fuck letting this woman steamroll everything for some weird emotional powers trip over children.\n\nThis has made me really angry. Some people are not fit to parent.", "NTA, your parents are forcing a relationship that didn\u2019t come naturally. While it\u2019s not nice to take things out on kids, (they don\u2019t know any better) it\u2019s understandable you have conflicting feelings on the situation and are not being heard, just forced to preform \u201cthe perfect family\u201d \n\nWhile your parents are jerks for that, try to be nice to your younger step sibling. they\u2019re annoying, but ultimately this situation is not her fault and she doesn\u2019t understand the punishment you\u2019re giving her. You\u2019re very sweet for giving her some of your time, and smart for putting up boundaries and saying no to protect your alone time. Fuck those \u201cfamily meetings\u201d where everyone seems to get a say except you!", "NTA.  They\u2019ve spent years trying to force you into a relationship you\u2019re not comfortable with.  They don\u2019t respect your personal boundaries and allow her to be bratty to you over some bullshit fantasy they have.  \n\nWhile you should always be kind to her, I don\u2019t like how they made it sound like you should drop everything to cater to her whims.  Always making room for her in your bed??? I have two children (full siblings) and would never expect the older one to do that.", "NTA. When will step parents finally accept that they can't force a bond between children? As harsh as it is, but your step sister hears the truth now before you can grow resentful of her. I don't blame her, she's just a kid, but I blame your step mother and father. Thumbs down for them.", "Guarantee the step mom never had a sister of her own and had an idealized idea of how her own older sister would have been so devoted to her.   \nNTA.  But both your dad and stepmother are AHs for sure.", "NYA. This whole thing could have easily been avoided had your step mom not lied. This boils down to literally just being her fault. You have no blame as you don\u2019t need to form a relationship if you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA - When you were age 9, your stepmother wanted you to make these vows, saying you'll do your step sisters hair whenever she asks,etc. You didn't say vows and I  commend you for that. It would have been difficult at 9 years old. A lot of the vows sound like things your stepmother should have been required to do, not a 9 year old child. \n\nNow that your step sister is 9 years old, go to your stepmother and tell her she has to make her daughter vow the same things to you. I mean, she's the same age now as you were then. \n\nYou were supposed to be available on demand anytime your stepsister wanted her hair done at age 9.  Your stepsister should be able to your hair now, plus her own, she is 9 years old after all.", "NTA. Your dad and stepmom set your stepsister up for failure by giving her these unrealistic expectations of what your relationship will be. There are plenty of biological sibilings who are not close so I do not understand why people try to force the bond between step sibilings. Forcing bonds or relationships never work. Emotionally manipulating/guilty people into having relationships never work. Taking a way someone's choice of whom they want to care about is never going to get people what they want. Yet this patterns continue to happen in a lot of blended families. Your dad chose to marry your stepmom and be a stepfather to your stepsister. You didn't make that choice but because you are a minor you have to live with these people. Don't let anyone guilt you about a relationship you never agreed to have with your stepsister. Remind your father you are only two years away from being an adult. Does he really think he can force you to have a relationship with your stepsister than. Ask your dad what type of relationship he hopes to have with you as an adult if he doesn't respect your feelings now.", "NTA\n\nAs a general rule, you are never responsible for maintaining other people's lies.", "NTA - The step mom and step sister missed the part where that's op's problem.", "NTA and your stepmother sounds completely deranged. I mean what was the plan there? Did she really think she could bully a 9 year old into some legally or morally binding contract to be her daughters plaything forever?", "NTA. Your dad and stepmother are...unbelievable. I'm stunned that they a) tried to force a child to make a vow and b) are now lying and trying to force a relationship that you don't feel. You absolutely do not have to play their game. Your stepsister interrupted your call and tried to hang up on your aunt - that's something she needs to learn not to do.", "Listen OP, I don\u2019t think you should have come to Reddit for advice. I\u2019m losing my mind here because YOU are a kid too. Really consider asking your parents to see a therapist.

Your father and your stepmother clearly didn't think this through.", "NTA\nShe wanted you to be a parent at 9. She is upset that you won't and created an entitled brat. She can cry all she wants but your dad needs to man up.", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't your fault at all. Its on the parents.\n\nThe posts that say otherwise are just blaming a child for the adults actions.\n\nYes op is 16. But they are still learning too. They are not an adult yet. A teenager that still has a lot to learn but is being forced by parents into a no choice situation.", "NTA and all of this could have been avoided if her mother hadn\u2019t lied to her and set unrealistic expectations.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that you had the strength of character even as a small child to say no to an adult.  Well done you.", "NTA. I hate it when adults pressure a child to do these kind of things. It seems to backfire all the time. Whether it is for them to accept a step parent or step sibling instead of letting a relationship to form naturally they add pressure and expectation and then are surprised when it fails. \nOP do you think you and your step siblings relationship would be better without this interference?", "NTA\n\nSounds like someone thought she was marrying into a free babysitting service.", "NTA it's hard to naturally bond with someone when the relationship is being forced on you. All this vow shit is ridiculous and is making your step sister entitled. You were on a call with a family member and she tried to end it just because she wanted you to do her hair? She couldn't wait till after the call either, it had to be right then because you owed it to her. That's just ridiculous and they're going to raise her to be an absolute brat if they don't change how they're going about this soon", "NTA You are not that child\u2019s emotional support animal. That child needed direct vows from your mom and dad. This is wildly inappropriate from your dad & step mom needs HELP", "NTA - Oh god I remember when a friend was all up in my business all the time. We had grown up together and he just couldn\u2019t take the damn hint. I had to cut him off all together. I couldn\u2019t imagine living with that 24/7, 365. Especially as a kid. Everyone needs their alone time and freedom. Your step mom sucks, really bad.", "NTA that kid need to learn some boundaries cause they are sounding exhaustingly entitled.", "NTA, that vow thing is not something most step siblings do, do not resent your step sister though shes acting like a nine year old, it's your father and stepmother who are to blame they're trying to use you as a babysitter to keep her out their hair.", "NTA", ">The vows she wrote for me say things like \"I'll always do your hair when you ask, have makeovers whenever possible, take you to the park, play dolls and climb trees with you, snuggle on the couch and always make space for you in my bed\" and that's not even the whole list of what she promised from me. \n\n\nThis is bizarre and controlling behavior on the part of your stepmother, trying to force you into the big sister role.\n\nSo my question- did your stepmother recite any vows to you about what she was going to do for you? Be there, help you, be a mother figure while still respecting the memory of your mother?\n\nYou're NTA.

That pain of never feeling good enough to be worthy of my sister\u2019s love carried into every relationship I\u2019ve had since, including my marriage. I\u2019ve had to do so much work to even see that, let alone heal from it. And I don\u2019t hold my sister responsible, she was just a kid. She\u2019s not a monster or an evil person. But sometimes I think about how different things would have been for me if she had loved me back then, if we could have been close like other sisters. I carry so much sadness and insecurity to this day because I had to live with her constant rejection every day of my childhood. \n\nYou are not an AH for this, but my heart breaks for your sister who didn\u2019t choose any of this either.

You made vows to that child designed to include him in the ceremony in a fun way and to show that you cared about his happiness. What the OP\u2019s stepmother was demanding of the OP was nothing like that. \n\nImagine if, instead of you freely choosing to promise to make your stepson\u2019s favorite meals and buy a chocolate milk fountain, you had instead demanded that he make vows to bring you breakfast in bed every weekend, give you footrubs on demand, and tell you how wonderful you are and how much he loves you on a daily basis. Imagine if he rightly declined to make these vows and you still expected him to abide by them. Don\u2019t you think that demanding those vows would make you an entitled asshole, and that expecting him to live up to vows he never actually made would make you an idiot? Do you think that he would ever be able to love you if you treated him like that?\n\nIf the OP\u2019s father and stepmother ever want the OP to have any kind of positive relationship with her stepsister, they need to drop their ridiculous demands, and train her stepsister not to demand attention. She should be disciplined for making demands and kicking up a bratty fuss when the OP doesn\u2019t indulge her every whim, not taught to think that she is entitled to be the center of the OP\u2019s universe. \n\nThe adults are doing the OP\u2019s stepsister a great injustice by encouraging her to think of herself as entitled to other people\u2019s time and service.

That is not the case. Being kind doesn't mean you have to do what she wants. Being kind is saying no without yelling or being harsh when you say no. Being kind does not mean you have to hang out with her if you don't want to. There is a 7 year age gap between you two. Most 16 and 9 year olds don't have anything in common. Most 16 years old would not want to spend time with a 9 year old even if they actually considered them to be a sibiling. The point I want to make is there are alot of comments saying that you should be kind or it isn't your stepsister's fault. Those are also emotionally manipulative tacts to make you feel responsible for manging someone else expectations that they have unfairly placed on you. Your stepsister has learned if she she cries and whines she it gets her what she wants which is a reaction out of people. She gets comforted and babied by your dad and stepmom or out of guilt you give in to her sometimes.

Your younger step sibling has been taught to treat you like a toy to play with instead of a person to love and if you don't do what she says she complains to her mom that her toy doesn't work. \n\nI really hope you can get support from your family who can treat you as a person (your aunt & uncle) instead of the people you love with who sound like they only want you to be a sister for their youngest child. \n\nYou need help from people who care about you and aren't biased towards your step siblings as your parents have become by trying to force an unhealthy relationship here.\n\nIdeally you need to talk about all of this with a therapist, or counselor - hopefully your aunt & uncle could help you with that, if not a doctor or teacher but it has to be an adult you can trust (unless you can just refer yourself at 16 - depends on the country & if doing so would be alerted to parents)\n\nYou're NTA here, anyone who says anything else is ignoring how much the people involved are using OP as a means to entertain/be at every whim of the younger child.\n\nEdit: for context & clarity I have two older sisters, & have a similar age gap to OP & step-sibling myself.", "She can pretend she actually likes her sister.", "Still doesn't make it okay to take it out on a child.

She is 16, not a tiny child. And her position sucks ass. But 16 is not too young to learn diplomacy, how to handle other people's feelings with compassion, and being empathetic. OP has not caused these events, but someone else (shitty stepmum), has made her an intricate part.\n\nI'm not saying it is fair, but OPs reality is this situation. She can choose how to handle it. It is her life, and her family dynamic. \n\nIt's not fair when drug addict parents force the eldest to raise the youngest. It's not fair for emotionally abusive parents to force the kids to rely on eachother. A lot of things aren't fair.\n\nAll I'm saying, is yes, its not fair on OP to be responsible, but she has a choice, and the ability to understand that a 9yo does not have the same emotional maturity, or the ability to make the same choices.

NTA.", "NTA, and once again we have a parent/s who INSIST that their blended family look like something from a Norman Rockwell painting, or an Instagram photo. And in this case it's especially sad, as reading your comments it's pretty clear you WOULD have been happy to fill the very \"big sister role\" that almost any bit sister would have filled for a 6-years-younger sibling, namely, play and do things on a fairly regular but time-limited basis, because the age gap is just too big for many common interests. THIS is why newly blended families need the services of competent family therapists as soon as (or even before) the families merge - so the expectations are reasonable and realistic all around.  \n\n\nOP, you're 16, so I assume you will have the option to move out, either to work or go to college in less than two years. So the situation will be at least partly solved by time.

It's only a couple more years (which can be a very long time to a teenager - I was one once and I do remember). And while you're still home, don't initiate ANY recreational time with your stepsister before dinner if you can avoid it - make sure you're always busy, if you can. After-dinner movies are time-limited (by bedtime). And please remember, although your stepsister has become an entitled annoyance, this is entirely the fault of your father and stepmother, who have allowed her to become this way by trying to force you into a role you didn't choose.

Your father should not be allowing this.", "Where is your father in all this? Your actual parent.

Sister's shouldn't be rude to eachother either, but stepmum seems to have fucked that relationship up.\n\nI'm confused on why you think I was saying this dynamic is ok, it isn't. But it is what OP is stuck in. And at 16, she can choose the nice way to deal with it. She also has to deal with 2 more years there minimum, so getting advice saying 'be blunt!' will make her life hell.

It would be very easy for OP to be kind, while simultaneously telling stepsister to back off. 9 is not a moron. 9 will understand.", "This.\n\nYour stepmother is entitled.
