My stepsister (9f) was 2 at the time. My mom died and her dad bailed on her mom when she was pregnant with her and was never in her life and never paid child support or anything. When my dad and his wife married, they wanted to do a family unity ceremony which meant me and my stepsister would be standing there while vows were made to us and then (as the kid who could speak) would make a vow to always be there for her, to love her and be her big sister. I passed on that. My dad was upset. His wife was even more upset because she wanted the video to show her daughter one day, of me making those vows to her and holding her. The ceremony happened. They made the vows to us while I was sitting and she was being held by her mom. But I didn't make any vows.\n\nThere has been an expectation set that even though I didn't say the vows, that I would be the big sister my dad's wife wanted for her daughter. The vows she wrote for me say things like \"I'll always do your hair when you ask, have makeovers whenever possible, take you to the park, play dolls and climb trees with you, snuggle on the couch and always make space for you in my bed\" and that's not even the whole list of what she promised from me. But she did expect that stuff and was disappointed when I didn't. Dad pushed sometimes, but not all of the time, which I get, since he probably did want more cohesion from us and for me to make an effort to try and love her and be a sister for her.\n\nAround the age of 5 my stepsister started to get a bit more demanding with that stuff thanks to her mom and my dad a bit. She'd always want me to take her places, or always want to tag along with me, was always coming into my room, etc. It got annoying. And when I would play with her or watch a movie with her she never wanted it to end. She'd cry and whine and her mom would try to make me keep going when I would say I needed to do my own stuff now. Dad sometimes intervened but not always.\n\nA few nights ago she came into my room when I was Facetiming my aunt and said I needed to do her hair the way I did mine at night. She got into my laptop screen and tried to end the call. I had to do it myself and then when I told her I wasn't doing it for her after that she said I made vows to be her sister and was being mean by not. I told her I made no vows. She said I did and her mom showed me them. I said her mom wrote those and I never said them. She told me that wasn't true. I called her mom in and told her she needed to stop lying and tell her the truth. Dad came in and told my stepsister the three of them needed to talk. My stepsister was so upset by what I said and when it was confirmed she ran off crying to her room saying I don't love her.\n\nDad asked me if I could console her and assure her I do love her and I said I couldn't do that. So he went to comfort her. But his wife said I was an ass and should have played along to spare her daughters feelings.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680947659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fhazb/aita_for_telling_my_little_stepsister_i_didnt/", "score": 9582, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly I should have figured it would hurt her feelings to have me say that when she was so attached to the idea. By saying I didn't make them and making such a big deal out if it I really crushed her and she's young and has known me practically her whole life and wants me to be that sister she thought I promised to be.

I think it would be normal with that big age gap that the bigger sibling doesn't want play with the younger sibling all the time. And your stepmother and father have been in the wrong when they tried to force the big sister - small sister -relationship to happen. These things happen naturally if you give time and space.", "NTA - The step mother and your father have forced you into a relationship and didn't give you a choice. Your SM lied to her daughter about the vows and expects you to do all the things she wrote in those vows and now the daughter expects it too.\n\nYour dad is a AH for not bothering to defend you.", "NTA - you have been forced into a situation you don\u2019t want to be in and that\u2019s not OK. I would gently suggest you speak to someone professionally about this and also have your stepsister talk to someone separately too. At the end of the day, she\u2019s 9 years old and these interactions are going to be damaging for you both in the long run.", "NTA - I can't imagine how frustrating it must be to constantly have \"we're a family\" rammed down your throat, and forced interactions with a much, much younger unrelated person. Your Dad married your step-mum, she came with a daughter, so yes, you're technically step-sisters; however that doesn't mean you need to play into your step-mothers weird fantasy of you semi-worshipping her child. I'd stick with enforcing your own boundries, you're entitled to decide who you interact with and how that interaction looks.   \nPlus it's really not fair on you to insist a 9 year old tags along with a 16 year old. You're both at quite different stages of life and development. Your Dad continuing to allow this to happen is really just going to breed resentment the longer it goes on.", "NTA, it sounds like a tough situation to navigate and you did the best you could", "NTA. even biological sisters don't hold so many expectations for each other", "NTA. Your stepmother tried, and continues to try, to force you to be view your step sister as your sister. In doing so, she probably pushed you two apart. Your father went along with it more than he should have, but seems to have a good feel for the emotional delicacy involved. It\u2019s almost like the mother of a two year old really thought emotions stayed as simple as a two-year-old\u2019s forever. \n\nFor lying to your stepsister, and not even briefing you on the lie, your stepmother was an AH and foolish. She\u2019s TA here.", "NTA. Your stepsister is only 9 but you are only 16. You are not an adult and it\u2019s not your responsibility to build a cohesive and blended family. It was your parent\u2019s responsibility to nurture an environment that yours and your sister\u2019s relationship could grow and instead of doing that they tried to force YOU to be a certain figure for your little sister. \n\nI\u2019m from a large family and this perfect idea image of a big sister doesn\u2019t exist. I\u2019m the baby in the family and my older sister wasn\u2019t expected to be any sort of figure in my life. Sometimes she would let me in her room, watch cartoons, fix my hair ect, and sometimes she wouldn\u2019t.My parents didn\u2019t teach me that I was entitled to do anything with her so I understood my sister\u2019s boundaries. There is a 9 year age gap between me and my sister.", "Your stepmom sounds selfish and annoying", "NTA.\n\nBy trying to make you commit to this list of vows that she wrote, your father's wife has done you a huge disservice.\n\nIt sounds an awful lot like she was pressuring a 9 year old child into agreeing to sign a legal document. Now I know its not a legally binding contract, but this lady was attempting to hold it over you as if it was. That is very toxic behaviour from an adult towards a child, especially a child that has lost their mother.\n\nYour father is also to blame for not ever really standing up for you. That's literally his number one job.\n\nBlended families are hard. They can be very challenging to make work successfully. But your father and his wife seem to have done a remarkably poor job at doing this. It's like they don't  understand that you're your own person, and not just someone that lives to do the whims of your younger stepsister.\n\nThey have failed you both massively.", "NTA. I\u2018d judge differently if this were an isolated incident but your stepmother is to blame most for creating the situation and your father is also an AH for letting it come this far. Sure, you could\u2019ve been less blunt but you\u2019re a teenager yourself and didn\u2019t create the issue.", "NTA. The sad thing is that maybe you\u2019d really have been sisters, but there wasn\u2019t a chance in hell with the way your stepmother pushed this.", "NTA. \n\nI cannot, cannot stress how much I hate stepparents who try to force their way (and their children\u2019s way) into relationships with their step kids. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to experience all of that for 7 years. I\u2019m sorry your dad and stepmom were so selfish they put their own desires and needs above yours.", "NTA\n\nYour  dad and stepmom are a case study in how to fuck up a blended family. They should never have lied to your stepsister or tried to force a relationship even biological sisters wouldn't conform to.", "NTA -- can you go away to college?", "You are not obliged to consider anyone's feeling who don't care for your feelings. It is incredible that her mum expected you to love her daughter and wrote so demanding vows. Good that you didn't play along. It is really mean to make a child promise anything, actually, but to be a real sister even meaner. Real sisters have boundaries, by the way...\n\nShe is responsible her child's mental balance, not you. \n\nNTA", "It kinda sounds like your stepmom has been eyeing you off as a free nanny since you were 9?

Your dad should be protecting you from this insane, coercive shit.\n\nI'd try and get your dad on his own, a day out somewhere, and confess how your feeling but get those waterworks going and really lay it on thick. He sounds weak as fuck letting this woman steamroll everything for some weird emotional powers trip over children.\n\nThis has made me really angry. Some people are not fit to parent.", "NTA, your parents are forcing a relationship that didn\u2019t come naturally. While it\u2019s not nice to take things out on kids, (they don\u2019t know any better) it\u2019s understandable you have conflicting feelings on the situation and are not being heard, just forced to preform \u201cthe perfect family\u201d \n\nWhile your parents are jerks for that, try to be nice to your younger step sibling. they\u2019re annoying, but ultimately this situation is not her fault and she doesn\u2019t understand the punishment you\u2019re giving her. You\u2019re very sweet for giving her some of your time, and smart for putting up boundaries and saying no to protect your alone time. Fuck those \u201cfamily meetings\u201d where everyone seems to get a say except you!", "NTA.  They\u2019ve spent years trying to force you into a relationship you\u2019re not comfortable with.  They don\u2019t respect your personal boundaries and allow her to be bratty to you over some bullshit fantasy they have.  \n\nWhile you should always be kind to her, I don\u2019t like how they made it sound like you should drop everything to cater to her whims.  Always making room for her in your bed??? I have two children (full siblings) and would never expect the older one to do that.", "NTA. When will step parents finally accept that they can't force a bond between children? As harsh as it is, but your step sister hears the truth now before you can grow resentful of her. I don't blame her, she's just a kid, but I blame your step mother and father. Thumbs down for them.", "Guarantee the step mom never had a sister of her own and had an idealized idea of how her own older sister would have been so devoted to her.   \nNTA.  But both your dad and stepmother are AHs for sure.", "NYA. This whole thing could have easily been avoided had your step mom not lied. This boils down to literally just being her fault. You have no blame as you don\u2019t need to form a relationship if you don\u2019t want to.", "NTA - When you were age 9, your stepmother wanted you to make these vows, saying you'll do your step sisters hair whenever she asks,etc. You didn't say vows and I  commend you for that. It would have been difficult at 9 years old. A lot of the vows sound like things your stepmother should have been required to do, not a 9 year old child. \n\nNow that your step sister is 9 years old, go to your stepmother and tell her she has to make her daughter vow the same things to you. I mean, she's the same age now as you were then. \n\nYou were supposed to be available on demand anytime your stepsister wanted her hair done at age 9.  Your stepsister should be able to your hair now, plus her own, she is 9 years old after all.", "NTA. Your dad and stepmom set your stepsister up for failure by giving her these unrealistic expectations of what your relationship will be. There are plenty of biological sibilings who are not close so I do not understand why people try to force the bond between step sibilings. Forcing bonds or relationships never work. Emotionally manipulating/guilty people into having relationships never work. Taking a way someone's choice of whom they want to care about is never going to get people what they want. Yet this patterns continue to happen in a lot of blended families. Your dad chose to marry your stepmom and be a stepfather to your stepsister. You didn't make that choice but because you are a minor you have to live with these people. Don't let anyone guilt you about a relationship you never agreed to have with your stepsister. Remind your father you are only two years away from being an adult. Does he really think he can force you to have a relationship with your stepsister than. Ask your dad what type of relationship he hopes to have with you as an adult if he doesn't respect your feelings now.", "NTA\n\nAs a general rule, you are never responsible for maintaining other people's lies.", "NTA - The step mom and step sister missed the part where that's op's problem.", "NTA and your stepmother sounds completely deranged. I mean what was the plan there? Did she really think she could bully a 9 year old into some legally or morally binding contract to be her daughters plaything forever?", "NTA. Your dad and stepmother are...unbelievable. I'm stunned that they a) tried to force a child to make a vow and b) are now lying and trying to force a relationship that you don't feel. You absolutely do not have to play their game. Your stepsister interrupted your call and tried to hang up on your aunt - that's something she needs to learn not to do.", "Listen OP, I don\u2019t think you should have come to Reddit for advice. I\u2019m losing my mind here because YOU are a kid too. Really consider asking your parents to see a therapist.

Your father and your stepmother clearly didn't think this through.", "NTA\nShe wanted you to be a parent at 9. She is upset that you won't and created an entitled brat. She can cry all she wants but your dad needs to man up.", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't your fault at all. Its on the parents.\n\nThe posts that say otherwise are just blaming a child for the adults actions.\n\nYes op is 16. But they are still learning too. They are not an adult yet. A teenager that still has a lot to learn but is being forced by parents into a no choice situation.", "NTA and all of this could have been avoided if her mother hadn\u2019t lied to her and set unrealistic expectations.\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that you had the strength of character even as a small child to say no to an adult.  Well done you.", "NTA. I hate it when adults pressure a child to do these kind of things. It seems to backfire all the time. Whether it is for them to accept a step parent or step sibling instead of letting a relationship to form naturally they add pressure and expectation and then are surprised when it fails. \nOP do you think you and your step siblings relationship would be better without this interference?", "NTA\n\nSounds like someone thought she was marrying into a free babysitting service.", "NTA it's hard to naturally bond with someone when the relationship is being forced on you. All this vow shit is ridiculous and is making your step sister entitled. You were on a call with a family member and she tried to end it just because she wanted you to do her hair? She couldn't wait till after the call either, it had to be right then because you owed it to her. That's just ridiculous and they're going to raise her to be an absolute brat if they don't change how they're going about this soon", "NTA You are not that child\u2019s emotional support animal. That child needed direct vows from your mom and dad. This is wildly inappropriate from your dad & step mom needs HELP", "NTA - Oh god I remember when a friend was all up in my business all the time. We had grown up together and he just couldn\u2019t take the damn hint. I had to cut him off all together. I couldn\u2019t imagine living with that 24/7, 365. Especially as a kid. Everyone needs their alone time and freedom. Your step mom sucks, really bad.", "NTA that kid need to learn some boundaries cause they are sounding exhaustingly entitled.", "NTA, that vow thing is not something most step siblings do, do not resent your step sister though shes acting like a nine year old, it's your father and stepmother who are to blame they're trying to use you as a babysitter to keep her out their hair.", "NTA", ">The vows she wrote for me say things like \"I'll always do your hair when you ask, have makeovers whenever possible, take you to the park, play dolls and climb trees with you, snuggle on the couch and always make space for you in my bed\" and that's not even the whole list of what she promised from me. \n\n\nThis is bizarre and controlling behavior on the part of your stepmother, trying to force you into the big sister role.\n\nSo my question- did your stepmother recite any vows to you about what she was going to do for you? Be there, help you, be a mother figure while still respecting the memory of your mother?\n\nYou're NTA.

That pain of never feeling good enough to be worthy of my sister\u2019s love carried into every relationship I\u2019ve had since, including my marriage. I\u2019ve had to do so much work to even see that, let alone heal from it. And I don\u2019t hold my sister responsible, she was just a kid. She\u2019s not a monster or an evil person. But sometimes I think about how different things would have been for me if she had loved me back then, if we could have been close like other sisters. I carry so much sadness and insecurity to this day because I had to live with her constant rejection every day of my childhood. \n\nYou are not an AH for this, but my heart breaks for your sister who didn\u2019t choose any of this either.

You made vows to that child designed to include him in the ceremony in a fun way and to show that you cared about his happiness. What the OP\u2019s stepmother was demanding of the OP was nothing like that. \n\nImagine if, instead of you freely choosing to promise to make your stepson\u2019s favorite meals and buy a chocolate milk fountain, you had instead demanded that he make vows to bring you breakfast in bed every weekend, give you footrubs on demand, and tell you how wonderful you are and how much he loves you on a daily basis. Imagine if he rightly declined to make these vows and you still expected him to abide by them. Don\u2019t you think that demanding those vows would make you an entitled asshole, and that expecting him to live up to vows he never actually made would make you an idiot? Do you think that he would ever be able to love you if you treated him like that?\n\nIf the OP\u2019s father and stepmother ever want the OP to have any kind of positive relationship with her stepsister, they need to drop their ridiculous demands, and train her stepsister not to demand attention. She should be disciplined for making demands and kicking up a bratty fuss when the OP doesn\u2019t indulge her every whim, not taught to think that she is entitled to be the center of the OP\u2019s universe. \n\nThe adults are doing the OP\u2019s stepsister a great injustice by encouraging her to think of herself as entitled to other people\u2019s time and service.

That is not the case. Being kind doesn't mean you have to do what she wants. Being kind is saying no without yelling or being harsh when you say no. Being kind does not mean you have to hang out with her if you don't want to. There is a 7 year age gap between you two. Most 16 and 9 year olds don't have anything in common. Most 16 years old would not want to spend time with a 9 year old even if they actually considered them to be a sibiling. The point I want to make is there are alot of comments saying that you should be kind or it isn't your stepsister's fault. Those are also emotionally manipulative tacts to make you feel responsible for manging someone else expectations that they have unfairly placed on you. Your stepsister has learned if she she cries and whines she it gets her what she wants which is a reaction out of people. She gets comforted and babied by your dad and stepmom or out of guilt you give in to her sometimes.

From there you can flip the script on your dad and step mother and explain you want a normal relationship that is based on mutual respect rather than obligation.\n\nLet me be clear you are of no personal obligation to do any of that, it is a decision for you to make, I say that with the intent of giving an example of how you can balance your autonomy while mitigating damage to your relationship with the rest of your household.", "NTA, and I suggest family therapy for this situation. It's hardest for you and your younger step-sister. At some point, you may find a way to express some empathy for how difficult the experience has been for her, which may help.\n\nIf your family won't get therapy where the therapist will listen to you without your step-mother cutting you off, I'm going to make a suggestion that, unfortunately, has you being the one mature adult in the room. Point out, if you agree with me, that the whole ceremony and vows tried to dictate the nature of your relationship with your stepsister, one that you refused to accept. Your stepsister has been given these vows as an expectation of the relationship that you are supposed to have with her, and sees the gap between that and reality. The pressure to fulfill these \"vows\" that you've never accepted likely interferes with you naturally developing a voluntary relationship with your stepsister, because the expectations and your will to resist them loom too large. I also wonder what sort of relationship your stepmother has with you? Does she see you as a person, notice and honor your interests outside your role in the family? Or is her focus overwhelmed by how you fulfill this \"big sister\" expectation she has for you? \n\nWhen things have cooled down emotionally, I think it would be good to think about your step sister's feelings and a way to speak to and/or spend time with her that would feel authentic to you, but also set some boundaries. One things that is really bizarre about the vows is the \"always\" in so many of them. That's not a healthy expectation to have at all. Did your stepmom vow to \"always\" do her daughter's hair?", "NTA\n\n>his wife said I was an ass and should have played along to spare her daughters feelings.\n\nYou wouldn't have to \"spare her daughter's feelings\" if she hadn't lied to her daughter in the first place.    \nIt's not like kids making step-sibling vows is a common expected thing that little step-sis would have even thought of if her lying mother hadn't brought it up. \n\nEven if she was your bio-sibling those \"vows\" aren't things that should be expected.", "NTA, but you could use some empathy.", "NTA\n\nWhat stepmom wanted is for you to be lil mommy or lil babysitter. \n\nRegular siblings have the type of relationship you guys have already, older one playing but doesn\u2019t want to all the time, younger one always wanting to play. That\u2019s normal. What\u2019s not normal is your stepmother forcing it which backfired.", "It's entirely possible that all of those things they wanted from you would have happened on their own, but by forcing it as an obligation, they made you resent the very idea of it.\n\nThey tried to make you, a child, swear to a lifelong commitment of being responsible for another person's whims.\n\nOf course you would push back against it, and of course she would develop a sense of entitlement about it.\n\nAs the adults in the situation, they have chosen and acted poorly and have more or less guaranteed that you two likely won't ever have a sisterly relationship.\n\nIt's 100% on them.\n\nNTA\n\nI would ask you to understand that it's not the kid's fault that she was lied to and given a false sense of things. Also, even though you both are short one parent, she never knew her dad, so she doesn't have the same sense of loss that you do. For her, your dad is the father she never had, for you, this woman is just someone that showed up wanting you do be something you're not while dealing with the loss of your mother.\n\nIt might be good for you to write out your complete feelings on all of this when you're not in the immediate frustration of it all and give it to them so thwy can understand better. I don't think anyone here wants you to be miserable, but they're trying to force what they think is best in a foolish way.", "I hate to hear things like this because even though I know OP is NTA, I can't help feel bad for the trauma inflicted on a child because the mother attempted to force and created expectations that OP did not signup to. \n\nStepsister is going to be scarred for life. Op sounds like she's got it together enough to get through this without too much scarring. \n\nInstead of allowing a relationship to form naturally between the two girls, if any, she forced it down their throats and it's her own daughter paying for it.\n\nDad's a dud BTW.", "NTA\n\nThis story makes me angry,  so I'm going to vent a little. I grew up with a biological sister, and my mom made me the parent. I was guilt tripped into playing with her and reminded constantly that she is my only sister, that I'm older and should take care of her. Which on the surface is nice, but it turned her into a very entitled person. If i don't feel like spending time with her,  I'm selfish,  I hate her,  I'm a narcissist, etc.(her words). She started being extremely rude to my friends, kicking boyfriends in the shins, encouraging my mom to spank me, arguing about everything. All while at the same time we were \"best friends\". She's not all bad. She has a good sense of humor and is fun to hang out with sometimes. But It's been exhausting. My default is guilty. I never got the chance to have boundaries. It's been a lot better now that we're in our 30s, but it took a few years of therapy.  And I could probably use more.\n\n I'm glad you stood up for yourself, OP. You are not responsible for other people's feelings, especially not at 8 or 9 years old.  What your SM is doing is manipulative and wrong. It's not your responsibility to raise your stepsister; to make sure she is loved, mentally healthy, and contributing to society.  That's the adult's job.", "Nta.\n\nMay I add, what the actual fuck. This can't be normal.  Vows, between step siblings? What in Alabama is this.", "NTA. Kudos for sticking up for yourself and not being manipulated. I feel bad for your stepsister though. Her mother is creating a monster.", "NTA but i think that maybe you could try and explain to your sister a  little bit. 9 years old isnt an unreasonable age. so if you think it could be worth it explain boundaries, like 'you dont always like to do whatever someone wants you to do and thats okay. but the same goes for me. you can ask if i will do something for you and maybe i will and maybe i wont. but that doesnt mean i hate you. and i didnt make any vows when you were a baby because i barely knew you and your mom. regular sisters dont make vows or do things for each other all the time but they still love each other' \nobviously i'm assuming things about your relationship here but i think that 16 and 9 are both hard ages and creating a rift now will deprive you of the one person who really understands your family experiences one day. but i also know sometimes that kind of relationship isnt possible. i dont think you should decide that now though. you both are going to grow up a lot in the next decade.", "NTA.\n\nTell them you want a divorce.", "NTA. This is incredibly unhealthy, and honestly, I would shoot for emancipation or potentially moving in with your aunt and uncle early. Things are not going to get better from here. Your step mom and dad are going to double down and try to force a lasting bond because they know that in 2 years, they have no control over you anymore. So they've gotta make whatever they want happen now. If you have a counselor or teacher at school that you trust, please confide in them and see if they can give you any information on any options. I would contact a lawyer or someone about seeing if you could get custody of you transferred to your aunt and uncle.", "NTA\n\nIf her mom never fed her lies in the first place there wouldn't be anything to \"play along\" with. \n\nThis is entirely on her mother and your father.", "Kudos to you at 9 years old standing your ground. Any in the vows your dad and SM made to you, you can use? I'm sorry your dad got such a SM for you and her own daughter. Maybe you can bond over that. Help her stand up to her mother. SM can't complain since she wsnts you to bond, right?", "NTA.\n\nThis whole situation sounds so foreign to me. Vows for a step sibling? It does sound a bit creepy.\n\nThere's such an age gap between you, you shouldn't be expected to include her at all.\n\nBe civil and friendly? Of course.\n\nBut not to be forced to be a parent for some 1950s ideal your step mother has about being a girl.", "NTA\n\nDamn, are you suppose to be Cinderella?", "ESH.

Parents will learn one day that you can\u2019t force children to be something they aren\u2019t or to participate in activities, sports, arts, music, etc that they don\u2019t have any interest in. I can\u2019t stand a parent forcing a child to participate in something they hate. I saw it too many times growing up. I loved sports but would always have that one kid on my team that hated it but their parent/s were forcing them to play because that was the parents dream.", "Wow everyone\u2019s putting so much on you when you never wanted nor asked for it. \n\nNTA.

It's her way showing affection for real like following and mimicking is basic affection and bond building\n4) You can't force yourself to have an emotional bond for her but you are being raised as siblings and that's not her fault. From her perspective you are her sister. You might want to think on that. Family is not blood alone. Is there a reason you pull away from her so?", "I mean N T A but Jesus I don\u2019t understand how people can be so cold.

I think you will regret that when you\u2019re older. I don\u2019t have step-siblings, but just considering the ages involved here\u2026 I think family therapy would be a good idea. \n\nJust because you didn\u2019t say the vows doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not an asshole for rejecting your sister who has looked up to you her whole life.", "Hi OP. Obviously you're NTA. I'm turning 16 this year and I have older siblings so I can imagine your situation. My older siblings never had to do all those things your manipulative stepmother wants you to do with your stepsister, and our bond is extremely strong and we love each other deeply. You don't force a sibling relationship, it happens if it happens. You're a teen, and you're in a time where you need to discover life, explore things, learn more about yourself and spend time with people on the same vibration as you. So you need your own space. The fact that your stepsister can just call her mom when you want to gain back that freedom could probably turn her into a spoiled brat that cries when she doesn't get what she wants in the future. I think you really need to talk alone with your dad and explain to him how you feel about that whole situation, even if he tries to be dismissive saying that things could get worse, don't let him escape just like your stepmother doesn't let you escape. Talk with your whole heart. And maybe you should also try to speak with your stepmother and explain to her that she needs to stop living into her fantasy world where you have to dedicate your life to someone else than you. She may have trauma left from her daughter's father leaving her, but that's not a reason to force people into accomplishing her dreams while holding back their freedom and their dreams. Anyway, you're really strong and really mature. And from your comments, really smart too. Keep pushing. And never forget that in order to love others and to live freely, you need to think about yourself first. Because I'm sure that when you're gonna be 22y.o or whatever, your stepsister won't be able to force you into all that stuff. And at the end of the day, you never promised anything. Your stepmother did, so she can do all those things herself.", "Soft ESH, yes the expectations of you are high from your stepmother and step sister, however she is only 9.\n\nYou need to have a conversation with your father on boundary\u2019s you\u2019d like to have in place to protect you from your stepmothers expectations but also keep in mind 9 year olds are annoying and she probably just looks up to you and wants your attention/approval", "Funny thing is you\u2019re behaving just like normal sisters. Older sisters don\u2019t want to do ever for their baby sister and resent younger siblings getting special treatment. (and even if you had made those vows, you\u2019re a kid so contracts aren\u2019t binding!) NTA", "ESH. You didn't make any vows to her, but you also don't need to treat a girl 7 years younger than you like this. Many blended families try to create bonds between the two sides. Sometimes, it works, and sometimes it doesn't.  It doesn't mean that the parents shouldn't have tried. You have the right and choice not to make vows, and you have the right and choice not to want a relationship with your step sister, but that doesn't make you a N-T-A. Every one get some family counseling", "Esh. This is why I refuse to be a step mom. If the step mom doesn't act like a mother they are called hateful things and told to step up coz they married a package deal. But if the step children for any reason decide that they don't want a step mom,  they can act as mean as they like and it's accepted coz \"the parents shouldn't have forced the marriage on the kids\". Step parents can't win for losing.  The OP's mom passed away so there's zero reason she shouldn't have been happy to get a little sister. Most kids like playing with other kids. But instead like so many step kid stories on Reddit, she refused to.  \n\nI've even read Reddit stories were there is no 2nd step siblings or stupid vow and the kid still acts like a brat. There was one where the parents later had kids and she told them they weren't her family.  They were here half family. The parents never tried to force the other kids on her. They went to counseling and the kid just refused to want to be part of a family.  \n\nIt's like they just want their parent to be single for the next 18 years and be unhappy. A lot of step kids are very selfish.  They have a bio parent who loves them. A step parent who loves them and step siblings who love them and they just spit in all their faces. \n\nI hope once she turns 18, she moves out and the parents and sibling go straight non-contact.", "NTA - please don't take the stance of not doing anything for the stepsister if you do love her.

If not - this is manipulation.  If so, she was trying to connect with you and show you valuable interaction skills.    \n\nRemember - if you want more than one child yourself, how would you like them to interact with each other? Model that behavior.", "YTA.

All because of a stupid vow that her ridiculous mother came up with. She (and your dad) could have let nature take its course (without forcing your stepsister) on you and maybe you would have developed a relationship a relationship naturally.

But let\u2019s not skip over the part where the stepsister was **2 years old** when she gained an older stepsister and she was nowhere near old enough to understand the difference between being blood related and not. She clearly loves her stepsister, and nobody in here seems to give a shit about this poor little girl\u2019s feelings? She\u2019s only 9 ffs. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that this is entirely on OP. OP was forced into an awkward situation and I don\u2019t think she should necessarily be forced to bond with her stepsister on a super deep level or keep these promises that the mother made on her behalf. But at the same time, she didn\u2019t have to make a little girl cry & feel unloved and then refuse to comfort her! That\u2019s just cruel tbh.

We needed to define our relationship on our terms, not hers. Made for some very bad years in our 20s.", "You sound very mature and self aware. You are seeing all these lines of connection.

All that would build resentment towards stepsister. I feel others are too harsh on OP. She was a child when this started and spent her adolescent years like this, and she had no chance to build her OWN relationship with her stepsister. She was TOLD what the relationship would be, and no one likes being told what kind kind of connectiontheyll have with someone. The 2 adults are to blame. The step mom is forcing something to happen because in her head, it's how it should be, but she's not taking into consideration that OP is her own person, not a TV character. OPs dad is not respecting OPs boundaries and isn't there for her, defending her. OP has been left on her own to deal with this. As for the stepsister, I'm not sure if she idolizes OP or if she just expects her to do these things because of stepmother, but how she acted in that one scenario where she told OP what to do and was trying to turn off the video call was just rude, and makes me think she feels entitled to OPs time.

I tried so hard to spend time with him and hang out, but he wasn't interested. We were never close, and many times his resentment would come out. Everyone told me that's just how bug brothers are. I was angry at him for years for being such a crap big brother. If I had been born into the family he never would have treated me that way, right?\n\nBut that was part of the problem. I wasn't a baby.  I was already a fully assembled 9 year old. He was a teenager. I'm ashamed to say, I never thought about how his life completely changed, and he never got a say. He should have been in therapy to adjust, but nope. He had every right to be resentful of the situation. \n\nNow I'm mad at everyone who led me to believe he wanted a sister. That the way he acted was normal big brother behavior. All that did was give me anxiety and depression over what I could have done wrong to make him hate me when he wanted a sister. What was wrong with me that he wanted a sister, just not me?? \n\nYour parents should never have lied to your sister. Her feelings might be hurt right now, I promise it's better than growing up confused and resentful. Her hurt feelings are the fault of her parents for lying to her and setting this situation up.", "Going to go against the grain and say you sound pretty awful. ESH, they tried to force a relationship, but you sound extremely selfish.", "NTA. If you're feeling petty, make a list of vows for your stepmom. It's only fair.\n\n1. I will drive you anywhere you need. \n2. I will buy you a car.\n3. I will pay for your college, etc.", "NTA. If you don't feel close to her, you don't feel close to her. Your step-mom pushing this nonsense is no help.\n\n         \nI'm also not convinced it has anything to do with the fact she's not your sister. You might have been just as uninterested in a sibling seven years your junior if you were full siblings or half-siblings.   \n          \nIt's unfortunate your dad and your step-mom fed her a lot of lies and created this situation.", "Biological sisters with an age gap of 7 years struggle to bond and usually the older one finds the younger one annoying. Your step mom had very unrealistic expectations from the beginning \n\nThat said, you are now 16, you two did grow up together for the past 7 years, which to a 9 year old are her entire life and almost half of yours. There should be some affection there. \n\nWhat do you have to gain by making a 9 year old feel unloved and rejected by someone who to her is her actual sister (memories begin at around age of 2, you were in her life from the beginning)? Be the bigger person and show more maturity than your step mom. Explain to your sister that you did not take those vows, it would have been unfair to you and unrealistic, but you do love her. However, your love doesn't mean she can take you for granted or cross your boundaries, be demanding and annoy you in purpose. That is what being sister means, love and respect.\n\nIf you don't feel love towards her, don't see her as a sister, tell her you care about her + the above about  crossing personal boundaries and respect. \n\nWhatever you choose, don't choose to spite your stepmom.", "Agreed", "Say those things.

Maybe run that by Dad first, alone. Stay strong, it\u2019s what, only 2 more years?  Before you could move across country if you wanted and they couldn\u2019t make you do a thing including come home for holidays.

If not, you might point that out the next time she's haranguing you about you attending her daughter's whims and fancies.", "NTA. Curious if you've ever expressed that to your Dad and what he's said if so.", "That's a really messed up way of looking at a willing and loving stepfather who chose this. \n\nLike yeah she's expecting way too much and trying to take advantage of OP but damn", "Yeah I'm surprised \"climb trees\" was on there and not \"go shopping\" or \"giggle over boys\" or \"catch you when you faint\"", "All of this. My sister and I were raised this way. My mom and her sister were very close and she kept throwing that in my face as a kid everytime I would refuse to play with my sister etc. Now that we're adults my sister is still very spoiled and I'm *still* expected to bow to her every whim unless I put my foot down. We aren't close at all and every interaction is forced now. Even now my mom tries to force something that just isn't there, and it might have been if she had just left well enough alone.", "You need to send this post to your father. He needs to read all these comments regarding the damage his wife is doing to both you girls. My husband passed away when my son was 12. I can\u2019t fathom marrying a man who tried to force a brotherly relationship with a significantly younger stepbrother. I\u2019m guessing, if left alone, you would be closer to your stepsister than you are now.", "> there are worse things\n\nThat's textbook invalidation. Starving children in Africa doesn't make what's on your plate taste any better to your tongue.", "NTA. Your step mother created this issue. There is no expectation on step siblings to make vows to each other when their parents marry and it's unrealistic to expect them to, so if she had never said anything your step sister would never have tried to hold it over you. The fact that she even showed her the \"vows\" is delusional and really worrying. If she wants you to act like her daughters big sister I (mum of 3 girls and boy, and a big sister to 4 myself) can reassure her - you ARE. Real life big sisters aren't all sweetness and light, braiding their kid sister's hair and wanting to spend all their time with them - that's TV stuff, not the real world. Sisters fight. They get on each others nerves. They tattle on each other and steal each other's stuff and do each others heads in. Then one day something big will happen. Maybe big sis will hear that someone is giving their little sister a hard time at school, and suddenly there is a shift as they think \"oh hell no, that's not on\" and realise they feel protective. That doesn't mean they don't still get pissed off with them though - little kids are annoying lol! But here's the big secret... the more that little pain the ass wants to be near you, that's how cool she thinks you are. She looks up to you and since she was so little when they got married, you are all she has ever known. To her you ARE her big sister. The fact that she is hurt that you never said those vows? Not your fault. That is on her mother - she didn't even need to know that kids making vows was a thing (hell, this is the first I have heard of it). It wasn't OK for her mum to make promises on your behalf. But if you can, remember right now she is a little kid who has been lied to by someone she trusts and feels hurt as a result, while that's not even slightly on you, it doesn't hurt to be kind, even to annoying little kids. Take care :)", "NTA. I have had multiple step-siblings in my life and fortunately, none of my step-parents has ever tried to pull some crap like this. I also have two half sisters and two half brothers, and if anything I constantly got reminded that they're \"only half\" siblings, whatever the fuck that is supposed to mean. The point is that I choose to see them all the same way. My step-siblings, on the other hand, I have zero relationship with. Don't like them, trust them, or want anything to do with them. \n\nYour stepmom and dad trying to force you into a relationship like that was never going to work. They tried to manipulate you and it backfired. You're not obligated to be in love with being a big sister, whether it's a stepsister or a DNA linked sibling. I'm sorry they're trying to guilt you into being something you don't want to be. The sad thing is that if they had backed off, over time, things might have developed organically but you'll never know because they tried to pull this nonsense. I hope it gets better.", "This can happen in a bio family too. At 16 nobody wants to hang out with a 9 year old unless they\u2019re getting paid to babysit. Little sisters can be pretty demanding. Good for you for setting boundaries and sticking to them. My sis and I were constantly fighting in our teen years bc I wanted to be my own person and she wanted to match. But now as adults we depend on each other a lot. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s a way to verbalize your boundaries to your sister so she gets that you don\u2019t hate her you\u2019re just sticking up for yourself. That\u2019s an awesome lesson for a big sister to pass on. Don\u2019t write off your potential future with your sister out of spite for your step mom.  Sounds like you might be the only one in the family who can teach her about respect and healthy boundaries. \n\nAND mini-mothering her is NOT your job. If you are willing to compromise - maybe agree to babysit one evening a month (perhaps with one girly activity). Parents need to see that it\u2019s a job, and give you some form of compensation or reward in exchange for your added responsibilities. (If not money, then a higher level of trust, or an experience you\u2019ve been wanting). The rest of the time they need to give you space to be a teenager.\n\nEDIT: the video/vow thing is SO strange. Never heard of anything like that before.", "Ugh, your stepmother! NTA. She has her fantasies. And she\u2019s manipulative.

We'd all love them to know what we all think, which is pretty much what most people would think. I'm sure your stepmother would be upset. But what about your Dad? Honestly he should be ashamed that he took the easy way out by enabling his entitled wife to treat you like this. You said that sometimes he takes your side. What would happen if he actually knew the depths of your feelings here? That you might leave and never come back, that everyone thinks he's a crappy father, that he's lazy and his wife is selfish? He seriously can't love his stepdaughter more than he loves you, he just doesn't want to deal with his wife's tantrums.", "I have to say that my parents and my aunt and uncle, didn't **intentionally** do that to me. The mistake they made was not talking to me about what was going on, and pretending the early parts of it never happened, on the assumption I wouldn't remember, because I was too young. \n\nThe fact that everything was well-intentioned didn't change the fact that being separated from my parents at six months, and then meeting them at 3 years and being returned to them after living all that time with my aunt and uncle--both parts separations were traumatic to a young child. The fact that I couldn't talk about it clearly and ask questions didn't change the fact that I remembered meeting my parents when I was 3. I *knew* I hadn't been with my aunt and uncle just a short time, but everyone pretended I had.\n\nThe additional back-and-forths after that had more context, but still contributed to me not being sure I belonged anywhere.\n\nNow, or, heck, in the 80s, when I finally got independent confirmation from a great-aunt who didn't know I wasn't supposed to know, a child psychologist would have told them to handle it very differently.
