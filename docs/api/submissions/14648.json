Amy (fake name), have been arguing for a week with our families on different sides so i want to ask what you guys think.\n\nAmy has seven kids (2f,3m,5m,8f,13m,13f,14f) from seven different men and she has recently gotten pregnant again. As my family including amy is prolife-im not- she will not get an abortion. She heavily relies of her baby daddies and me and my family for money for her kids because she wont get a job. \n\nI am often left babysitting at least 3 of them for weeks at a time while she goes on fancy vacations her onlyfans pays for. My mom (46f) gets stuck with the kids i dont have, also for weeks. \n\nThe argument happened last night when she announced the pregnancy, and i called her a whore because i dont want to waste anymore of my money and watch more kids when i\u2019m trying for a baby myself with my wife. AITA?\n\nEdit: Ive asked for money to babysit, but she keeps saying she will but never sends me any. Keep in mind these aren\u2019t my kids, and im watching them for weeks on end. I love my nieces and nephews to death, so thats why i don\u2019t complain, and they will have nowhere to go to because my widowed mom cant watch all 7 at the same time. I cant leave them alone in a house unattended even the older ones.\n\nSECOND EDIT: I really dont want to cut her off, because id be cutting all my favourite kids off, i love them all so much. We have tried to talking to her before, but she is still so stubborn. We are completely fine with her being a sex worker, but she does it riskily by not wearing condoms and in that way of work, protection of any kind is important to not get STDS. The two 13 year olds are irish twins for the people asking.\n\nUPDATE: Ive called my mom, and shes decided she wants the kids. If amy cant look after them, my mom will and the money will come from amy. We will sit her down tomorrow hopefully, and tell her my mom wants the kids AND CHILD SUPPORT. Me and my mom are finding evidence shes a neglectful parent, and we will show her and this will (if all goes well), go to court and we will get amy agreeing in writing to give parental rights and monthly payments of hopefully at least $2,000 considering how much she makes a month. I will update again after the talk.", "created_utc": 1681346167, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12k5p3z/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_a_whore/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Seven pregnancies by 32 and an at least somewhat successful OF. \n\nBut seriously, NTA. Calling names isn\u2019t nice but she\u2019s incredibly irresponsible and reckless and has put a lot of people in a bad position out of her selfishness.", "My friend was asking what her onlyfans @ is....J/K \n\nNTA.... how come she can't pay for her kids with the onlyfans money? Also, you and your family are kinda enabling her by helping pay for her kids and watching them for her, just say no. Maybe y'all should start there.", "Stop babysitting. Eventually your mum will stop babysitting them when she gets overwhelmed. Don\u2019t give her money. It\u2019s really a no-brainer and simple as that. \n\nJust cut contact with her. You know what to do you\u2019re just choosing not to help yourself. Take some personal responsibility and tell her \u201cNO\u201d.\n\nTell her no. No. \n\nNo.", "NTA. I mean it\u2019s rough language towards your sister, but 7 kids by 7 different men?  She should\u2019ve heard this word enough that her skin is thick enough to handle it.  Why yes, I am judgmental this way.", "Sounds like she may be getting pregnant to live off these baby daddies?\nI mean, not totally, but maybe a small part?\nYour sister needs condoms and common sense.\nNTA", "How does she have two 13 year old children with different fathers?", "ESH. You should call child protective services.", "NTA. Yes, it's not good to call names, but If this is the most extreme thing you've said about her abhorrent behavior, I don't see how you could be TA in this situation. \n\nYou and your mom should get a babysitting agreement with money in writing. Then after more years of her not paying you at least you'll have some leverage in this situation.", "I don't understand the money aspect. Why is she not using her onylfans money to care for her kids? Is this some odd thing where only fans itself is paying for the vacations directly vs paying her money? Because if she's having income from OF that money should be spent on her kids not vacations. You are enabling your sisters neglect of her kids. So, as kindly as possible, I'll say Y T A for not standing up for yourself and your mom but NTA for now because there's still a chance for you to improve this situation. You and your mom need to put a total stop to the babysitting for weeks thing. Set a time limit I. E. 1 week, and call the police if she doesn't pick them up by then. Or ideally, don't even baby sit overnight in the first place, during the day only. Make sure your mom follows this too. If your sister can't stick to this then her kids should be taken from her, due to her neglect.\n\nI know you probably don't want to insist on less /no baby sitting in case it impacts the kids badly, but in this situation you have to do the shitty thing short term in order for them to have a better long term. Yes, initially it'll be harder for them but long term it'll be better for them. Every time you babysit you're just side stepping round the problem, and delaying the process that could improve their lives. And if your mom can't stand up for herself against your sister, you need to step up and help both of you, and stop yourselves being utterly taken advantage of", "NTA - She owes you.", "NTA with the edit. While it's terrible of you considering the timing, with the help you've given freely over years I find it fair.\n\n>I am often left babysitting at least 3 of them for weeks at a time while she goes on fancy vacations\n\nCompletly unacceptable", "ESH\n\nYou need to draw a boundary about giving her money and looking after her kids. Live your own life. \n\nBut calling her a whore didn't help anyone or anything, and is not the right way to go about setting those boundaries. Your boundaries are about your life, not hers.", "NTA. But she's not going to stop. I'd suggest moving out of town so you can control how much and when you see the kids.", "This is definitely fake lol the mention of onlyfans is clear try to get \u201cnice guys\u201d all stirred up about sex workers", "NTA she needs to put the D down and take care of her children and evaluate her life style.", "ESH. Stop babysitting and separate yourself if you have such a problem with it.\n\n46-32= 14? Apple doesn't fall far from the tree?", "ESH. That sounds awful, calling her a whore is just you being exhausted and cruel. Stop giving her money and providing child care. If you care about the kids talk to your mother about a plan to set boundaries that help the kids while stopping the enabling of your sis\u2019s terrible life choices.", "ESH. Calling her a whore when she announced her pregnancy was unnecessary. But I can see why you're frustrated with her, and it's probably past time that you set some hard boundaries around providing her with childcare.", "ESH, she should be held responsible for her children, but you also don't have to shame her for her lifestyle choice regarding procreation.\n\nThere are more constructive ways to remedy the situation. Don't take care of her kids, and don't give her money. If she's choosing to have them, then let her be accountable. \n\nIt may not be kind, but what you've been doing hasn't worked.", "ESH\n\nYou can't control her behavior, but you can control yours. Blaming her for your failure to say \"no\" to babysitting is silly.", "ESH. If you are not willing to cut her off, don't call her names. You are helping enable her.", "NTA. Put your foot down. Stop babysitting. Stop giving her money. She'll keep doing this cause you and your mom keep helping her out. Stop it", "ESH - Just don't watch her kids for her anymore. Problem solved.", "ESH - Is she an AH for having kids that she doesn\u2019t seem willing to care and provide for? Yeah. Is she an AH for having kids with seven different men and not taking responsibility for contraception and choosing to bring more kids into the world that she, again, is choosing not to care of provide for? Again, yeah. So maybe you should\u2019ve made the issue about feeling worried for the welfare for her kids instead of commenting on her sex life? Insulting her won\u2019t lead to anything productive.\n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t want to babysit the kids for *weeks at a time* (unpaid, I\u2019m guessing), then\u2026don\u2019t? Set your boundaries. You are not obligated to look after her kids when she\u2019s unwilling to. And stop giving her money! You are an adult! You can choose who you give money to and how you spend your time. So stop choosing to enable her and making yourself miserable.\n\nEDIT: OP, if you are concerned about your niblings, if they will be unattended if you aren\u2019t forced to watch them, then your sister is not able to be a parent to them and you may need to contact authorities.", "ESH\n\nYou can stop babysitting, but throwing out insults make you also TA.", "NTA - you called her exactly what she is. Also, stop being so nice and watching her kids. Tell her no. Have her baby daddies watch the kids.", "To your 2nd edit, can't have it both ways sweetie (calling your sister a whole and then wanting to play favorite aunt to your nieces and nephews). So you both still suck.", "ESh. If you don\u2019t want to babysit, then don\u2019t baby. But calling her a whore is uncalled for especially since it is unprompted.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s honestly offensive to sex workers to compare your sister to them.\n\nMost sex workers have much better judgment than your sister.", "ESH - Not cool of her to expect others to take care of her and her kids; she generally sounds horrible. \n\nAlso not cool of you to call her a whore. I didn't read anywhere that she charges. There are so many other things you could have reasonably gone after her for, but instead you just went for low hanging fruit.", "ESH - Your sister for her irresponsible and downright neglectful and probably abusive behavior around procreation and child care and you for continuing to enable this behavior and thereby encouraging it.  And while I'm sure I'll get downvoted to perdition, I swear that when I read that list, all I could think was \"a freaking clumsy one\" so I'm just not even going to give a judgement either way on what you said.", "ESH Your sister for her irresponsible behavior, and for making you promises she then doesn't keep (money for babysitting).\n\nYOU for the name calling.  That's your sister, ffs.", "YTA. However, stop giving her money and babysitting her kids. She needs to start adulting your your enabling her. If she leaves the kids with you, call cps.", "NTA\n\nYou can cut her off without cutting off her kids. No one is doing anyone here any favors by enabling her irresponsible behavior.", "YTA. If you think so negatively of her then remove yourself from her life and stop watching her kids.", "Yta that was extreme.  You should just say no to watching her kids.", "YTA, just stop letting yourself be pushed around. If you don't want to babysit,  nobody is making you.\n\nYou don't get to just call people names because you're upset.", "YTA  First of all, if you're pro-choice that means you should support her right to choose if she keeps the child or not. There are ways to set boundaries and explain you aren't able to devote more time and money to her children without calling her a whore. I understand where your frustration but slut shaming her during a pregnancy announcement is super shitty.", "ESH. Why do you baby sit?", "YTA - No reason to call her a whore just either get her to pay you to babysit with her OF money or remove her out of your life. I would suggest removing her out of your life as she sounds super toxic and entitled.", "YTA. For name calling. As for you and a future family nothing wrong with putting yourself first.  Start saving and don't be guilted into something you don't want to do. Money/Babysitting She's not going to change or care if the help is there.", "YTA since it's her body and her life. I think you're really pissed at yourself for being part and parcel of enabling her to behave the way she does. Just. Stop. That's it. Move, out.... away..... live your best life and let her (and your mom) deal with the consequences of her actions. Done.", "ESH", "Girl, you could have set boundaries and voiced your concerns without calling your sister a whore. Using that kind of language will automatically put her on the defense and you won\u2019t be heard.\n\nYTA", "YTA- that was really mean.
