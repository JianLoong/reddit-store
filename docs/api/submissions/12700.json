At least you got to spend time with the one family member that seems to care", "NTA.   Enjoy your sister though because you won't see her much in the future.", "Nta but doing it once in a while would be nice, but they should have asked you before you went. Now you know , and will be less likely to go home. But if I had kids 14-15 years apart I would certainly never expect the older one to be obligated to babysit.", "NTA -- you're a sibling who's there in a limited time capacity, they should have hired a babysitter.\n\nThere's also a *huge* difference between asking  you to babysit and TELLING you that you're going to babysit -- one involves respect, free will & autonomy, and the other is simply demanding, controlling & bulldozing. \n\nWhere did your parents go that they needed you to babysit?  \nIf you weren't home, what would they have done with your sister?", "INFO: did something unexpected come up (i.e. was this out of the ordinary)? What were their plans for your sister if you hadn\u2019t come back for three days? And was there any discussion about this expectation prior?", "NTA.  They have made it clear you are not a priority.   If they are paying for college, not much you can do, other than accept the situation and cut down on visits.", "NTA!!!!\n\nAs an older sibling and someone who\u2019s treated like a maid every time they visit home from college, your feelings are completely valid. Ignore the person who asked \u201cwho\u2019s paying your college tuition\u201d because you could be on drugs somewhere and being a low life, but instead you chose to further your education and work towards a career and that shouldn\u2019t be held against you or bargained for. Definitely enjoy time with your sister and while you can because they grow up really fast, but remember she\u2019s your sister and not your daughter. And if necessary, set this boundary with your parents as respectfully as possible", "Might be interesting to unexpectedly go the other way.  One day your folks will be old and tired and in need of some kind of support.  Your sister will be grown up and probably much more interesting to you than your parents will be.\n\nSo use the rest of your time on this visit taking her to the zoo, or ice skating for her first lesson, etc.  your parents have decided they aren\u2019t interested in spending time with you or her. Embrace it.  Make sure they don\u2019t see much of either of you.  \n\nThen decide not to come home again unless it is to see your sis.  Just write your parents off.  \n\nThey could have made you visit memorable for all concerned but decided not to bother.", "More information is needed.\n\nWhy did they ask you to babysit? Is it because they had to work? Got to a casino? Deal with a medical issue?\n\nAlso, who paid for you to come home? Did they pay for you to come home or did you use your own money? Who is paying for university?\n\nDid you spend all three days just caring for your younger sibling or only a few hours? Did you see your parents at other times? Are their cultural expectations regarding caring for your sibling that you are aware of?", "NTA. If you came to visit your parents and they ditched you to babysit that\u2019s not cool.

That's ridiculous.", "Nta", "NTA!!!!!", "It depends..... are they asking you to babysit because they are going to work, to pay (in part) your college bills?  In that case then you should see it as pitching in to help cover your own expenses to your parents.\n\nBut if it's babysitting so they can get away from you both for some fun times alone, then wow, def not TA.", "NTA.  They are going to be so \"disappointed\" when you stop coming home for breaks and being their free babysitter.  Make your own plans and have fun.", "NTA. Both your parents are TA for passing the buck on to you and guilt tripping you into babysitting. Parents can\u2019t handle kids why have them.", "NTA the spelling is B-r-o-t-h-e-r. Brother.\n\nNot p-a-r-e-n-t.

Definitely feels like babysitting when they ditch you into babysitting vs it being your idea.", "NTA.\n\nIf they don't care to spend time with you, you have to grieve and accept it.
