It is not constructive communication, but it was a very real frustration you have lingering you and your mom should sit and talk through things when not in the heat of the moment. Some family counseling may be good too. While what you said wasn't constructive, her comparing you to your siblings is completely unnecessary. It is a horrible family dynamic that will only serve to breed resentment between family members.\n\nGood luck", "NTA and I feel for you!!!  My brother was the oldest and the absolute golden child.   We were referred to as \"Dave and the girls.\"  I kid you not.  Constant comparisons to my brother led me to feel that I was the failure because I simply was not him.  Your family needs to understand that every time they compare you to someone else as a measure of success, they are essentially saying that you should be someone other than yourself.\n\nedit  - typo", "NTA\n\nThat is, I don't know the *exact* words of the argument, but since she played the \"why can't you be more like your brother?\" card, your response seems perfectly appropriate.", "Not sure how old you are, but I agree Mom needs a reality check.  Funny thing about parents like this is they like to tell the world they love all their children the same.... I know you know differently.  I wouldn't apologize.  Bottom line is if she wants respect then she also needs to give it.  Congrats on your SATs sounds like that was really good for you and you should be proud of that accomplishment.  \n\n\nNTA... edited to give the judgement.", "NTA\n\nWhilst your reaction was maybe not the most mature and productive, I completely understand how you were in the kind of emotional state to make an outburst like that.  It\u2019s one thing for parents to be proud of a high-achieving child, but openly using that comparison to belittle their other kids, especially when those other kids aren\u2019t actually doing badly at all, is tone-deaf at best and outright cruel at worst.  \n\nMaybe in your mother\u2019s mind, she is simply pushing you to do better by encouraging some healthy competition, but that\u2019s clearly not the effect she\u2019s actually having and for good reason.  Hopefully she can be made to realise that she is going about this the wrong way entirely, though after all these years I will sadly say don\u2019t hold your breath on that one.", "NTA, It sounds like you have a parent that is never going to be happy with what you do.  Your brother may have done some great things, but your mother comparing their accomplishments with yours is not constructive and hurtful.  My best advice is to support your sister the best you can and be there for each other.  Found family can be more supportive and healthy to you in the future and I hope that you find that soon.\n\nAlso, 1450 is a ridiculously good score, congratulations to you for that.  Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise doesn't have a firm grasp on percentages and statistics.", "NTA. Your brother IS the favourite child, so you were simply speaking the truth. It seems that it is ok for her to put you and your sister down and to treat you as second best, but you are not allowed to acknowledge this out loud. And I am disappointed in your dad for not having your back after you spoke the truth to your mother. Your mother owes you and your sister a massive, massive apology for the way she has treated you both all of your lives.", "NTA congrats on the sat score but your parents especially your mother is disgusting it pisses me off when people have favorites", "Clear favoritism right here NTA", "NTA.  Agreed Mom obv considers son the ruler by which everyone else is measured.  Could this partly be cultural, where the boy is automatically shown favoritism?", "NTA. Don\u2019t have any advice for you but congrats on your score, that is an amazing achievement! Sending hugs and hope that you will meet people who tell you how proud they are of you!", "NTA. Blatant favouritism is always awful.", "Y T A for making your post so hard to read\u2026\n\nNTA for reacting in such a manner. It is like a pressure cooker that explodes after 10hrs of simmering.", "NTA.  Because that's not how you should talk to your child either so I guess you're even", "NTA no apology is warranted", "All families have favorites they all deny it but research has proven they have. My mother did too I stopped caring about it and don\u2019t show or talked about things with her I think that hurt her more than me but it is what it is", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was definitely less than in your case, but it still was awful. Years later I realized that gave me self-esteem issues, feelings of not being enough for her, for her expectations, and society expectations. And I didn't feel like I was good enough. \nBut then I realized I was perfect just the way I was, that I was enough. That I was more than good enough for myself, and that's what is important.

My best advice is to go far away and make sure to get as many internships you can so your parents can\u2019t force you home. Once you graduate and have a job go no contact. \n\nUse your time at university to make your own family. I worked at a private university for over a decade. You can make your own family.

Dad had hoped he did better, and brother said something like \"I bet you don't even have your SAT scores anymore.\"\n\nDad went upstairs and pulled out his scores. Iirc he did better than my brother. Don't throw out the \"well, let's see how you scored\" unless you're prepared for it, lol.", "That\u2019s awful to hear. I was my mom\u2019s favorite because I was \u201cthe smartest\u201d (had the best grades) and most obedient. I stopped being her favorite when I pushed back and refused to be a trophy for her to show off. My siblings were smart, but didn\u2019t do well in school and couldn\u2019t be shown off. She started saying I was a snob who thought she was better than everyone else. Most of my siblings copied her (they\u2019re all younger).\n\nI don\u2019t think I have a favorite, but perhaps my kids have a different perspective. They both have some incredible positive traits, and some areas that could use some self-reflection. We all do. I have always tried to make them feel loved equally and independent of their accomplishments. One kid struggled with grades while the other excelled. However, the one with higher academic success struggles with empathy and the other is incredibly caring. I have more common interests with one, but I spend time listening to the other talk about TikTok and drama to find common ground. Relationships are about effort and listening. I don\u2019t under parents like your mom and mine."]}
