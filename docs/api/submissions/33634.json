It is not constructive communication, but it was a very real frustration you have lingering you and your mom should sit and talk through things when not in the heat of the moment. Some family counseling may be good too. While what you said wasn't constructive, her comparing you to your siblings is completely unnecessary. It is a horrible family dynamic that will only serve to breed resentment between family members.\n\nGood luck", "NTA and I feel for you!!!  My brother was the oldest and the absolute golden child.   We were referred to as \"Dave and the girls.\"  I kid you not.  Constant comparisons to my brother led me to feel that I was the failure because I simply was not him.  Your family needs to understand that every time they compare you to someone else as a measure of success, they are essentially saying that you should be someone other than yourself.\n\nedit  - typo", "NTA\n\nThat is, I don't know the *exact* words of the argument, but since she played the \"why can't you be more like your brother?\" card, your response seems perfectly appropriate.", "Not sure how old you are, but I agree Mom needs a reality check.  Funny thing about parents like this is they like to tell the world they love all their children the same.... I know you know differently.  I wouldn't apologize.  Bottom line is if she wants respect then she also needs to give it.  Congrats on your SATs sounds like that was really good for you and you should be proud of that accomplishment.  \n\n\nNTA... edited to give the judgement.", "NTA\n\nWhilst your reaction was maybe not the most mature and productive, I completely understand how you were in the kind of emotional state to make an outburst like that.  It\u2019s one thing for parents to be proud of a high-achieving child, but openly using that comparison to belittle their other kids, especially when those other kids aren\u2019t actually doing badly at all, is tone-deaf at best and outright cruel at worst.  \n\nMaybe in your mother\u2019s mind, she is simply pushing you to do better by encouraging some healthy competition, but that\u2019s clearly not the effect she\u2019s actually having and for good reason.  Hopefully she can be made to realise that she is going about this the wrong way entirely, though after all these years I will sadly say don\u2019t hold your breath on that one.", "NTA, It sounds like you have a parent that is never going to be happy with what you do.  Your brother may have done some great things, but your mother comparing their accomplishments with yours is not constructive and hurtful.  My best advice is to support your sister the best you can and be there for each other.  Found family can be more supportive and healthy to you in the future and I hope that you find that soon.\n\nAlso, 1450 is a ridiculously good score, congratulations to you for that.  Anyone who tries to tell you otherwise doesn't have a firm grasp on percentages and statistics.", "NTA. Your brother IS the favourite child, so you were simply speaking the truth. It seems that it is ok for her to put you and your sister down and to treat you as second best, but you are not allowed to acknowledge this out loud. And I am disappointed in your dad for not having your back after you spoke the truth to your mother. Your mother owes you and your sister a massive, massive apology for the way she has treated you both all of your lives.", "NTA congrats on the sat score but your parents especially your mother is disgusting it pisses me off when people have favorites", "Clear favoritism right here NTA", "NTA.  Agreed Mom obv considers son the ruler by which everyone else is measured.  Could this partly be cultural, where the boy is automatically shown favoritism?", "NTA. Don\u2019t have any advice for you but congrats on your score, that is an amazing achievement! Sending hugs and hope that you will meet people who tell you how proud they are of you!", "NTA. Blatant favouritism is always awful.", "Y T A for making your post so hard to read\u2026\n\nNTA for reacting in such a manner. It is like a pressure cooker that explodes after 10hrs of simmering.", "NTA.  Because that's not how you should talk to your child either so I guess you're even", "NTA no apology is warranted", "All families have favorites they all deny it but research has proven they have.

It was definitely less than in your case, but it still was awful. Years later I realized that gave me self-esteem issues, feelings of not being enough for her, for her expectations, and society expectations. And I didn't feel like I was good enough. \nBut then I realized I was perfect just the way I was, that I was enough. That I was more than good enough for myself, and that's what is important.

My best advice is to go far away and make sure to get as many internships you can so your parents can\u2019t force you home. Once you graduate and have a job go no contact. \n\nUse your time at university to make your own family. I worked at a private university for over a decade. You can make your own family.

It's absolutely devastating and hurtful to hear things like that constantly. I won't apologize.", "NTA. If people want to talk about 'no way to talk to your family' they should start with how your mother speaks to you.", "Good one asking about mom\u2019s SAT score. And you might add what Ivy League college did she attend? None? Oh you\u2019re not my favorite parent.", "My older brother did okay his first round of SATs. Dad had hoped he did better, and brother said something like \"I bet you don't even have your SAT scores anymore.\"\n\nDad went upstairs and pulled out his scores. Iirc he did better than my brother. Don't throw out the \"well, let's see how you scored\" unless you're prepared for it, lol.", "That\u2019s awful to hear. I was my mom\u2019s favorite because I was \u201cthe smartest\u201d (had the best grades) and most obedient. I stopped being her favorite when I pushed back and refused to be a trophy for her to show off. My siblings were smart, but didn\u2019t do well in school and couldn\u2019t be shown off. She started saying I was a snob who thought she was better than everyone else. Most of my siblings copied her (they\u2019re all younger).\n\nI don\u2019t think I have a favorite, but perhaps my kids have a different perspective. They both have some incredible positive traits, and some areas that could use some self-reflection. We all do. I have always tried to make them feel loved equally and independent of their accomplishments. One kid struggled with grades while the other excelled. However, the one with higher academic success struggles with empathy and the other is incredibly caring. I have more common interests with one, but I spend time listening to the other talk about TikTok and drama to find common ground. Relationships are about effort and listening. I don\u2019t under parents like your mom and mine.", "Fun fact, 11 years ago the SAT had a totally different point scale. 1590 would have been a horrible score.", "NTA hold to your guns, favoritism sucks. Also they're really not doing your Golden Child brother any favors in the long run. When he gets to Harvard or whatever he's going to be a small fish in a big pond and things aren't going to come as easy for him. He will probably have maturity issues or other psychological problems, I guarantee you the GC in a family is damaged too.", "Apologise for the way you acted, but use it as an opening to tell her how her favouritism is so obvious and damaging. ESH- also it\u2019s not about your brother just having everything naturally, it diminishes the amount of work he definitely had to put in to become valedictorian", "NTA your mom constantly reminds you how much you failed her by not being nearly as successful or worthy of praise as your brother. Having put up with the same exact situations growing up as you are going through now, she needs someone to open her eyes. I was 19 when I bitched my mom out for over an hour and now we are best friends. She apologized and everything saying she didn\u2019t realize what she was doing at the time. Y\u2019all just need to talk it out, if she can\u2019t apologize for downplaying your successes and the constant comparing of two completely different people then she deserved the outburst IMO.", "Parents shouldn\u2019t be playing favourites. NTA", "My friend had a mother like that.  My friend got tired of being compared to her older cousin all the time, so when her mother once again brought up the whole \"Well, your cousin did so much better....\" routine, my friend fought back with how much more supportive her Aunt Becky was and how it's no wonder that her cousin does so well because her Aunt never degrads her own child's efforts.  It was a real eye opener for the woman!", "NTA. What about her comparing you to your brother rather than supporting you for getting a high score? You called her out on the favoritism. If they insist let them know why you said it.", "Truth hurts.\n\nNTA\n\nWell done on your result.", "NTA you don't compare you kids like that. It is wrong.", "NTA. Wow 1450 is amazingly good! I'm sorry your mom has no frontal lobe.", "NTA.  And while they--your father and brother--might say that's no way to talk to your mother, having an obvious favorite is no way to parent your child.", "Even ignoring the fact that she favors her other child, it\u2019s so sad when parents do not support their children.", "No it\u2019s no way to talk to her. But how she treats you and sister is no way to act either. I have been in your shoes and I\u2019ll tell you it won\u2019t change. I always felt tremendous guilt if my mom and I had a disagreement but I was also conditioned to feel that all my life. No matter bc I still felt it and it wasn\u2019t pleasant. I decided I was done with that and I let it go. She wasn\u2019t going to change and I am who I am. I began avoiding topics that would cause an argument and concentrated on just having a meaningless but pleasant visit. I suggest this approach. It\u2019s much more pleasant.", "NTA. It\u2019s so hurtful when a parent clearly favors one child over the others, and kinda ridiculous that everyone\u2019s just supposed to pretend it\u2019s not happening.   \nMy mom has never even tried to hide that my youngest brother is her fave, but would still be really upset if anyone pointed it out. (Hasn\u2019t always worked out great for him, he\u2019s also the one our dad resents the most.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSide note though, from a high-achieving oldest child- please don\u2019t assume their constantly striving for perfection is due to things being naturally easy for them, it could be from their own desperate attempts to be seen as good enough, & finally meet the parents\u2019 unrealistic expectations.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n<<A 1450 SAT score places you in the 97th percentile of all test-takers. >> just to put your score into perspective--You did better than 96% and \"worse\" than 3%(ish).", "NTA!!  Not at all.  \nFirst of all, as the favorite child your brother really, really needs to stay out of this. He has absolutely no idea what you've been dealing with living in his shadow.  \nYour father should be told that you will not apologize for telling her the truth. If she can't bear hearing the truth she needs to adjust her behavior.   \nSeriously, 1450 is damned good, certainly a score to be proud of.  \nYour mother should be ashamed of herself. She's the AH.", "Along the same lines\n\nWhen I was 15, my aunt gave me a Christmas present at big family Christmas, and it was my dad\u2019s high school report cards, and that was one seriously average student in the early 1960s. \n\nThey were both right-the effort he put in wasn\u2019t enough. Honestly, I found the effort my parents thought was mildly excessive wasn\u2019t enough. But, I wasn\u2019t just my grades either and that was a good reminder."]}
