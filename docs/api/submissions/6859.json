I have had health problems for the last 8 months so this is the one I chose.\n\nI have my mom we\u2019ll call t and my sister (24f) we will call j. My sister is a drug addict with 3 kids. All under the age 8. Her first kid (k) who will be 8 in February was when she started using drugs. I was 14 at the time and in school and I spent most of my time taking care of this kid. I raised her for 3 years and when I hit 17 the courts found out I was raising her and gave her to my mother. \n\nMy mother has always been money hungry and the only reason she is keeping k is because she gets more food stamps and extra money from the state. She was like my daughter. I was the one who potty trained her and taught her her first words. I did her first three birthdays. I was devastated considering my mother and I don\u2019t have a relationship.  \n\nI still see k and talk to her I help her with school clothes and make sure she always had food. I send her $150 a month to get anything she needs that my mom doesn\u2019t get her. I\u2019m the one who does Christmas presents and everything. \n\nIn my will I put she gets $500 a year from the time I pass to the time she is 18 to get items she needs for school. And incase of emergencies up to $10000 (hospital bills are anything like that. She also will get $3,000 a month after she turns 18 to use on housing. If she decides to go to school she gets $8,000 a month. After she hits 21 she can use the money to buy a house. After she hits 30 whatever is remaining she will get to keep. Receipts are also to be brought to the lawyer or bills if anyone except k takes the money out. \n\nI set it up this way so she still has to work for some stuff in life and also so my sister couldn\u2019t use it all on drugs or my mother waste it all. There is a section that also says she can use it for drivers training and a car before she turns 18 and get extra money to cover car insurance if needed IF she is the full owner and the only one allowed on insurance so my sister and mother can not drive it. \n\nMy lawyer was talking to my mom and sister about this so they would know what\u2019s going to happen. And to say the least they were not happy at all. \n\nMy sister is furious I kept her other two children out and my mother is furious I\u2019m making her out to be a money hungry b \n\nI did leave 10,000 to each of the other kids to have after they reach 18 but only $2500 to my mom and sister. \n\nI can not have kids of my own and I do not plan on getting married knowing how my health is.  K was like a daughter to me and I just want to make sure she is always taken care of. \n\nSo Reddit aita for mainly only including my niece in my will and wording it to make sure it lasts.", "created_utc": 1673219311, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106xevy/aita_for_how_i_made_my_will/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You owe none of your relatives a thing.

Everyone feels entitled to a piece of your pie even though they did nothing to deserve it. It's the little red hen story, and nobody helped you make the bread, so nobody deserves to eat the bread. Also, it shows their true colours in case you hadn't already seen them, and makes it an even easier choice to keep the will that way and not go out of your way to help them.", "NTA.

Get an executor for the trust to deal with any of this until she hits 30. Also don't tell them specifics of how it works, that just gives them a chance to find ways to work around what you have in place. Tell all of them you changed your mind and everything is in a trust for niece that can only be accessed by the executor who is restricted to a set of rules you will not discuss.
