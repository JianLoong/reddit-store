This would be using our own car which is quite an expensive luxury car and the driver is quite well paid for what the job is.\n\nMy niece (26F) heard about the position and really wanted the job. My wife and daughters loved the idea but I was not so sure. My niece is not a professional driver, and she has a full time wfh job, but lives next to us and said the schedule worked for her as her work is flexible as long as she does her job. My niece is a well educated woman and makes a lot of money already. She knew the salary I would be paying but said she would not mind doing it for less as she loves my daughters (she lives alone and has no partner or kids). She has a car of her own but I wanted the driver to use our car.\n\nI was not keen on the idea as my car is expensive and I wanted to hire an older driver with more driving experience. I insisted and hired someone else who is an older man in his late 60s and a retired taxi driver.\n\nMy niece has been giving me the cold shoulder since and my daughters are also upset with me. My wife did want to hire my niece but accepted my decision now which I am glad about since she contributed a lot towards buying this car.\n\nThe thing is, my niece used to babysit our kids a lot when they were younger for as as she lived near us and still does things for our kids sometimes and now I feel like it might be hard to ask her for any favors again. But at the same time I had to assess who I wanted to hire and feel like nepotism hires are wrong.\n\nEDIT: I guess I have some reconsidering to do. The taxi driver seemed appealing as some of these events have other people going to them who have chauffeurs, not that I agree that appearance should matter but I thought it would be nice to have someone who dressed like a chauffeur. We gave him a trial period so we do have room to reconsider. I would pay my niece the same amount if she took the job. But my main line of thinking was that she already had a job so he could use the money more as he is a retiree and a little more money would not really change her life.", "created_utc": 1676052021, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yye9e/aita_for_not_hiring_my_niece_to_drive_my/", "score": 750, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you have any reason to suspect that she might be an unsafe option to drive your kids? I am guessing that you didn't even think to ask.

This person may have been a taxi driver, but based on my experience in taxis, that doesn\u2019t necessarily make him a safe driver or someone I would want around my teenage daughters.

This would be using our own car which is quite an expensive luxury car and the driver is quite well paid for what the job is.\n\nMy niece (26F) heard about the position and really wanted the job. My wife and daughters loved the idea but I was not so sure. My niece is not a professional driver, and she has a full time wfh job, but lives next to us and said the schedule worked for her as her work is flexible as long as she does her job. My niece is a well educated woman and makes a lot of money already. She knew the salary I would be paying but said she would not mind doing it for less as she loves my daughters (she lives alone and has no partner or kids). She has a car of her own but I wanted the driver to use our car.\n\nI was not keen on the idea as my car is expensive and I wanted to hire an older driver with more driving experience. I insisted and hired someone else who is an older man in his late 60s and a retired taxi driver.\n\nMy niece has been giving me the cold shoulder since and my daughters are also upset with me. My wife did want to hire my niece but accepted my decision now which I am glad about since she contributed a lot towards buying this car.\n\nThe thing is, my niece used to babysit our kids a lot when they were younger for as as she lived near us and still does things for our kids sometimes and now I feel like it might be hard to ask her for any favors again. But at the same time I had to assess who I wanted to hire and feel like nepotism hires are wrong.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You keep using the excuse that you didn't think she could benefit from the income which is a very weak excuse imo. Did it ever cross your mind that your niece offered to drive your daughters not for the money but for the chance to spend more time with them? You mentioned she loves them and that she used to babysit them a lot. Maybe she doesn't get to spend as much time as she'd like with them anymore because of their schedules now. Maybe she saw this as a chance to do just that. More so because she offered to do it at a cheaper rate so money wasn't her main motivation.
