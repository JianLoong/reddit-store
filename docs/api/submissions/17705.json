Husband and I share the master which includes our own bathroom. After the rent and included fees we pay around $2000+ a month just for our room. Friend has her own room with a separate bathroom which is her own. We all pay our equal portions of the rent and on time as we agreed on.\n\nLately my friend has decided to enter the dating scene. Totally cool and supportive of that, she\u2019s a great person who deserves all of the happiness in the world. Most of these dates end in booty calls which hey, it ain\u2019t my thing but more power to her. The first few times she wanted the whole apartment to herself. Being that she just started dating again I was cool with it. It was summer break and I was out of school and only working part time and I let her know that it was fine until I resumed my full time schedule. Husband wasn\u2019t so stoked about it but I nudged him to be more understanding. He used to be a ladies man himself so \ud83d\ude02 plus he was hardly home while this was going on . This would go on once or twice a week throughout my break.\n\nThe problem is this: I am now working full time and have returned to school part time to become a nurse. Husband recently got a promotion at his job as well. We both work full time and I go to school and we are both very tired at the end of the day. Plus, during the week it\u2019s our only time together. Despite warning my roommate, she is now wanting me to still leave the house so she can do her mattress workouts. I pay a butt ton of money for this apartment and I just want to come home and relax when I get home from work. I\u2019m also disabled and have health issues on top of all this. \n\nI\u2019ve offered to put her up in a nice hotel once a week but she\u2019s adamant about having these men in her room. I\u2019m not critical of her lifestyle at all. It\u2019s her choice to date around as much as she wants. However, I shouldn\u2019t have to leave last minute every time she wants to get it on. I don\u2019t feel particularly great about having a revolving door of strangers coming in our place but I\u2019m not freaked out by sex noises or anything.\n\nWe discussed this arrangement already. I was fine with it since I was on summer break from school and not working as much. She knew when I was going back to life stuff full time. Now she\u2019s mad and calling me a cock-blocker. AITA?\n\nEdit: I have a security camera in my room and lock my room whenever I leave the house since I have important things in there. Thankfully she\u2019s not using my bed \ud83d\ude02 also we\u2019ve never asked her to leave whenever we have our couple time.

It seems to me that you\u2019re not at all bothered by the fact that your roommate is having fun without her pants on. The thing that seems to bother you is the fact that you\u2019re being kicked out so she can go to pound town. If you and your husband are not bothered by that then there really shouldn\u2019t be any reason that your roommate needs to have the whole apartment to herself. Like if you\u2019re completely okay with her getting it on with people in the apartment, there really shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Your roommate just needs to accept that she can have her fun, but you\u2019re not going anywhere.

Do her dates think she lives alone? They are using her bedroom.

I'm not an 18 year old kid in a sharehouse and don't need that in my life. If it was my wife's friend that was living with us and inviting those men in, it wouldn't be long until our own relationship was strained and I'd be asking her to tell her friend to move out. If that friend was pressuring me to not even be in my own home so she can have men over? HELL NO. She needs to leave immediately.\n\nYou created this monster against your husband's reservations, now you have to fix it.", "NTA. As long as all the doors are closed and you don't make it weird in the morning, she should leave you alone. I assume the thought of you and your husband getting on doesn't phase her, and she doesn't have to leave when the two of you want to get busy between the sheets? So why would it be different the other way around?", "NTA You made your (totally reasonable) feelings known. It was nice of you folks to give her so much privacy earlier on, but you made it clear that it wasn't a forever situation. You all live there, you all have a right to be there. Maybe if she is so concerned about being alone with someone she should find someone with their own place?", "NTA\n\nShe doesn\u2019t need the whole house to have sex. It was too far to offer a hotel room once a week, if she wants that she can fund it herself.

She needs to find dudes who have their own place.", "NTA. Something tells me this isn't reciprocal. I suspect when you and your husband want to be alone, she stays in the apartment. In part, you instigated this situation. By being reasonable to her request, you planted the thought in her mind that every time she wanted the place, you need to leave it for her. This must stop. Tell her it this stops or you will find a new roommate.", "NTA\n\nYou are paying for the living situation so I think you have good ground to stand on. It's odd that she is so adamant you can't be there while she boards the beef bus. Do you and your husband just never do the tube snake boogie then while she is there? Maybe I'm reaching here, but is it possible she uses your bed to jam the clam? Maybe questions worth asking ESPECIALLY after you offered to get her a hotel which was above and beyond an unnecessary nice gesture.", "NTA \n\nBut also not to be that guy but I would shift your language from master to primary bedroom :)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
