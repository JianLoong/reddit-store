It's small, but we work really hard to keep it clean and well maintained. I do enjoy entertaining friends when we can. \n        I met an acquaintance when our kids did sports together last summer, I really like her and her family. We had them over a couple of times for a BBQ and to swim, it was really nice.  We haven't really hung out out since last summer, but I usually see her and her/our friend at the gym in the mornings, and we say hello and make casual chat. We are all in a situation where our husbands are gone a lot, so we sort of bond over that. I really do like them both and mind you, I have absolutely put myself out there to bond more with them on a personal level. Like, when they say something about going to lunch or for walks, I always say I'm available and would love to join, just to let me know. They usually don't, and that's okay. I get it, we are all busy and have crazy lives, and I'm more of an afterthought friend. But I was thrown off a bit when she asked if I could host a party for her. She is hitting a milestone in her life and I am so proud of her...BUT, I have extended myself to her/them over and over and they basically don't reach out back... And now you want to use my backyard to host a bunch of people that I don't know?  We all have kids and I work full time out of the house, and it takes me HOURS to cook and clean, nevermind the cost of food, drinks and alcohol. It makes me feel like I'm being used for my house.  My house is the way it is, because I work my ass off to keep it clean. I put the time, money and effort in to make it a nice place for my family. I'm the one out there mowing the lawn and cleaning the pool, and making sure it's taken care of. My husband and I just spent the weekend re-mulching, putting new rock and flowers in and power washing everything to get it ready for the summer, and I posted it on social media. Minutes after that, she messaged me asking to hang out soon, as in the next day.  So, you suddenly want to hang out and have me host a party for you, right after I posted pictures of the work we put into cleaning the pool and getting the backyard ready for summer.... Where was my invite when you guys went out for lunch a couple weeks ago, or when you take your evening walks??\n\nI feel like I'm being used, and it hurt.  I don't think she intended it to be that way, but it did hurt my feelings. I work very hard to keep a nice, calm, warm space, and it's expensive and time consuming to keep it that way.  I wrote and back told her I wouldn't be able to host her party, it would just be too much for me to do on my own.", "created_utc": 1683303651, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138tm5x/aita_for_not_hosting_a_pool_party/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cut her off!\u201d I read your post one more time carefully and I can see your dilemma because there is something good about this friendship (when you actually get to spend time with them, it\u2019s nice time. This person or her family or friends are not rude or spiteful when you get together. And you have things in common - kids play sports, going to same gym, so you don\u2019t want to cut them off but you want more fair and reciprocated friendship.)\nAnd I can also read between lines you are a person who goes out of way for friends (you make sure house is very clean, you giveaway wine glass kit for moms party, you ended up watching kids whole everyone is enjoying inside - although I totally get that kids around pool is a liability not just your kindness. I\u2019m sure you do a lot more (than you wrote) when you plan brunches/dinners/parties to make sure to satisfy everyone), and also you tell them that you are available to join while you are not self inviting yourself. You are very considerate person. That\u2019s great characteristic of you for sure, but I think that also makes you disappointed when other people don\u2019t reciprocate. I totally think you feeling used is reasonable here, and I don\u2019t change my initial response (her request to be party host at your pool is too much). But since you learned this friend is not most considerate friend to you, try to do less to go out of your way to make them happy. People who don\u2019t go out of their way won\u2019t change just because you do, indeed they would get used to your hospitality, so at least you can save yourself from disappointment (and resentment worst).
