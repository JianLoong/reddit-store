Different dads. M was an addict so A grew up living with her paternal grandparents (well off, VERY religious). I grew up in and out of foster care depending on if Mom was on or off the wagon.\n\nMom finally got clean for good when I was 14, got into NA & AA, got custody of me again and was overall good. Held down a job etc. damage was pretty done though so I spent free time working my ass off, doing household chores and lawn work/shoveling for neighbors to save cash till I could get a real job.\n\nThen Mom met F in NA, they were married by the time I was 16, and things were still great though I still had trust issues and worked near full time in highschool saving every penny, in case of emergency \nMom & F got pregnant, within a year after the wedding, to twins. C & D (both f7) were born when I was 17/18 ish. Things kept going well, until F got into a car accident on the way home after work. The beans weren\u2019t quite 2, I was 19. Mom got depressed and very rarely had the energy to care for the beans after work so I kept living at home, and Mom and I cared for and raised the beans together, and I kept saving. \n\nThis went on for about 4 more years. In this time I got in a serious relationship with K (f25), who I love an insane amount. Things were pretty good. Until mom got sick (liver damage) and neither I nor A (who was LARGELY uninvolved in our lives anyway) were a match. And the beans were too young. \nMom passed last year. Before passing we did some legal work to make sure I could be the Beans legal guardian. K was and is FULLY on board. I decided to use almost all of my savings from the past 10 years (nearly 30G) as a deposit on a small house, but K suggested we go in on it together, she had a decent chunk saved and so together instead of me buying a 2 bed house, we bought a four bed, 2 bath house. Mom lived with us till she passed.\n\nAt Mom\u2019s wake, A met K, for the first time, made a comment about not realizing that I had made certain lifestyle choices, and left.\n\nA week later I received a call basically saying that A is planning on filing for guardianship of the beans (who have met her on maybe 5 occasions, including the wake) under the idea that I do not have the means to care for them and that I promote an unhealthy lifestyle and that it would be an inappropriate household to raise children in. And that it would be easier if I just gave her custody. I work in warehousing, K works as a nurse, we aren\u2019t as well off as A but we provide a stable home, healthy foods, even a bit of spoiling now and again, so I can only assume that A only dislikes K and I\u2019s relationship. I know A wanted me to hand over custody because she alone makes the same as K & I combined, and she has a well off husband, so they could provide the girls with a lot. And almost every one in my life other than K is saying I should give the Beans to her because she can provide them with more. But K and I are refusing to hand over the beans.", "created_utc": 1669590268, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z6fn8i/aita_for_refusing_to_give_custody_of_my_younger/", "score": 566, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell her she can go back to pretending she doesn't have siblings and the 3 of you will do the same. You were the one who helped raise the twins and you have an established bond with them while your older sister is a stranger to them. That usually trumps money in the court's eyes as long as the kids are well cared for. As long as you aren't residing in a country where there are outdated morality laws, I'd say A doesn't stand a chance since your mom and you took the legal steps to give you full custody. Please know that you're doing the right thing and your bond with the twins and the fact you've been the one to always stick by them and care for them matters more than A's money.
