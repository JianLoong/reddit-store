My husband is Matt, 25m. He has a  sister, Elizabeth, who is 19f. \n\nElizabeth mostly keeps to herself and spends a lot of time in her room.  She says that she suffers from \u201cDID\u201d, but she\u2019s only brought this up to my husband and I  once. She doesn\u2019t have an official DX and isnt in treatment, and my husband said that the illness only seems to present itself when she\u2019s on her TT, where she has a pretty large following and her entire family blocked. \n\nThis weekend she traveled to a party that was for other people with DID. Elizabeth doesn\u2019t travel often, and it was clear she was really excited. \n\nOn the lead up to the event she seemed to want me to be involved in her packing and getting ready. She asked me to help her pack, she told me all about the other \u201csystems\u201d who were going to be there. I don\u2019t follow any of that but I was really happy that she was happy and excited. \n\nThe day after she left I noticed i couldn\u2019t find my necklace or perfume. I figured they got mixed up with someone else\u2019s things since we had stayed the night. I told my MIL to keep an eye out. \n\nThen Elizabeth posted a picture (which was quickly deleted) of her wearing my necklace at the party-with a name tag that had MY name on it. \n\nShe went to this party wearing my necklace, as me. The next day when she finally returned our calls she was defensive off the bat. She said that she did not take the necklace but rather her \u201calter\u201d did, and that alters is an \u201cintroject\u201d of me. She apologized and said she\u2019d give the necklace back, she also confirmed she had taken my perfume as well. \n\nI told her how hurt and betrayed i felt that she had stolen from me, I told her I forgave her but it was going to take time to trust her again. \n\nLater that night we decided to check out her TT. I had to make an alt since she had all of her family blocked. at first I didn\u2019t think it was odd , i figured she wanted to keep her circles separate.  Now I realize it\u2019s because the stories she tells are completely fabricated. On top of blatantly stealing my name, personality, and sharing private things about me on her page, she has said things have happened to her by the hands of family members that don\u2019t exist. She claims med issues and allergies she doesn\u2019t have. Her comments are an echo chamber supporting this. \n\nMy husband took screenshots of her TT and sent it to his mother to prove that she had stolen my necklace and pretending to be me, as well as coming up with complete lies about their family. \n\nThe next morning she called us up freaking out, saying we outed her as a system and risked her safety and mental health, my husband told her that if she hadn\u2019t stolen my things and identity we wouldn\u2019t have had to but she had to take accountability for what she did. \n\nAITA in this situation?", "created_utc": 1681738209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pg1ln/aita_for_outing_my_sister_in_law_as_a_system/", "score": 319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I could be wrong but there are enough red flags here to make her self diagnosis very suspect.\n\nThere is a reason I don't do Tik Tok and such because who is real and who is faking it is hard to detect.  Who is doing things for themselves and who is being forced into it?  Her taking parts of your identity can be very problematic for you in the future especially if your name gets associated with issues she has caused.

It\u2019s a much broader term now.", "have you done ANY research on the verifiable links between DID, the satanic panic and the fact that most DID larpers claim to be brainwashed by Satanist\u2019s?\n\nEDIT: for the downvoters, I provided ELEVEN sources to back these claims up. Feel free to take a look :)", "Correct. There are not multiple personalities in one persons body. There is not a character of supernatural or homestuck in ANYONES body.\nDissociation and regression due to trauma are ABSOLUTELY real.\nOPs sister claiming she has an interject of her is a ducking joke.", "Extensive. and the fact that you not only continue to invalidate a verified medical diagnosis, but you are now generalizing an entire religion based on nothing more than christian propaganda and purposeful misinformation is just proof that you are just don't understand the situation. \n\nthe only branch of satanism that believes in satan is Crowley's branch, which hasn't ever had more than 300 members at one time. all other flavors are spicy atheism", "This is some bs extensive research if you can\u2019t defend any of your points. The Crowley thing is killing me dude lmao", "absolute straw man argument. I mentioned the satanic panic, which is a cultural event you fucking walnut, not religion or the intricacies of which branches of santanism actually believe in satan, which I\u2019m well aware of, thanks.\nit\u2019s YOU who doesn\u2019t understand the situation and I would bet dollars to donuts you\u2019re also under 25, with \u201cdid\u201d", "lol right? Crowley was not a satanist \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f himself and his wife, Helena Blavatsky were occultists. Crowley was sort of a dick but I\u2019m obsessed with Blavatsky. What a BAMF.", "except it's not. the Salem witch trials are not a \"cultural event\" this is documented mass hysteria, and the satanic panic is literally just the name that the media called it to further terrorize the public. im neither of those by the way and you literally claimed that satanists are the cause of the extremely small number of ritualistic violent crimes in the 90s, through brainwashing. I lived through this period of time. I am very aware of how nonsensical it was. From D&D to Vampire the Masquerade and from Meatloaf to Dio to everything in between. it's straight up malice against outsiders to the old christian way of life being demonized.\n\n\n  It has only ever been associated with DID when demonic possession was mentioned and it's always been straight up lies. the two ideas are not linked. possession is not real. exorcisms are not real. for someone who claims to be old and knowledgeable, you need to reevaluate what is going on. do you know what a straw man is? because if you did, you would also know that you are attacking me, not the argument,  calling me young and uneducated is a sign that you are losing, not me", "not what I\u2019m referring to.\n\n\nnot what I said. \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7960286/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8135697/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21248420/\n\nhttps://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/154415NCJRS.pdf\n\nhttps://digscholarship.unco.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1056&context=honors\n\n\n\nHere are five sources to prove you have absolutely no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I mentioned nothing about exorcisms and demonic possession, you are literally pulling words out of your ass and calling it a logical argument. Where are your sources, bud?\n\n\nALSO: Crowley was a chaos magician and his religion was Thelema, which he founded. You are incorrect on all counts.", "not gonna lie, i appreciate you having your sources ready to drop, especially on something more niche as this. i don't have mine thumnailed on my phone but i will edit eventually. but i have to take the humbling of you being ready to back up your claims,  when im not. i don't trust pubmed as they are funded by extremist christians, and i think that the university of Illinois has updated their stance, especially since Stockholm syndrome has been thoroughly thrown out of the latest dsm. but again, i do have to concede defeat until at least i can find my own sources. im a big girl and im not afraid to say that you have beaten me at this time"]}
