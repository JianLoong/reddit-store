IDK if it would ever come to that, but it sure does show a solid lack of parenting.  NTA.", "And I sure hope the daughter wasn't privy to this conversation!

Kids shouldn\u2019t be put in the middle of disagreements between their parents. OP is definitely NTA though", "Yeah, HARD STOP.  Don't try to emotionally pit children against the other parent.   This never has intended consequences and will eventually be discovered by the child, and it will be a sore point forever.

My Mom buried her Mom on her birthday, and I know how much that affected her.
