Then he got therapy and he changed dramatically. Turns out it was the root cause of alot of his anger.", "She's pushing her own insecurities onto you. NTA", "Of course NTA. She obviously doesn't understand. Adults don't want to recognize when their child has a problem because they think it reflects badly on them and their parenting. Anybody can be depressed for a lot of reasons even a child or teen. It doesn't need to be the death of a parent. It's great you're taking care of your mental health. Ignoring the problem won't make it magically go away. I hope the school counselor will be able to help you. Take care OP!", "NTA. She has some issues she needs to deal with herself.\n\nYou are clinically depressed. That in and of itself is a reason to be in counseling.", "NTA good for you for self advocating your mental health needs. \n\nShe may be projecting that you having mental health issues is a reflection as her as a mother. It's a weird protective ego thing that makes zero sense to anyone who knows about mental health.", "\"I never needed counseling when my parents died.\"\n\nWell clearly she did need it. If she had therapy at the time, maybe she would be a better mother now and not deny her daughter's needs. NTA.", "NTA. You have a depression diagnosis and counseling/therapy are a treatment for that condition. The counseling could potentially seriously help you, and it's free. Your mother is absolutely TA for trying to stop you from getting free counseling. She's being unreasonable- you seeking help for your depression is not attention seeking, it's life affirming. Also, a parent should never call their child an asshole. NTA.", "NTA counseling is healthy and helps provide coping mechanisms. Don\u2019t let her belittle or downplay what you feel, the only person who has to live in your body and deal with your brain is you, so don\u2019t ever let others tell you that because they \u2018don\u2019t need\u2019 something, you don\u2019t need it.", "NTA. My family said similar things with calling me a drama queen and that I was attention seeking when I was experiencing severe suicidal thoughts during middle school due to bullying and being overwhelmed with grades, even almost having gone through with it one night. It\u2019s different for everyone, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t still deserve help if they need or want it. If anything your mom is acting like TA in this situation.", "NTA. You needed help, you realised you needed help and you got help. That's amazing, especially for someone your age. I applaud you!\n\nYour mother unfortunately is the AH here. You want help and you got it for free. Especially since you got diagnosed with depression, it's important for you to maintain your (mental) health. Your mother shouldn't have a problem with it since it doesn't hurt her in any way (she doesn't have to pay for it, she doesn't have to make time for it, all she has to do is sign a paper).\n\nThe fact that she \"never needed it herself\" means she needed it herself, just couldn't or wouldn't get it, and doesn't want to sound weak. If she asks\"If you're like this now what will happen when I die?\", the reply would be \"thanks to those sessions, I'll be able to deal with it in a healthy way\". Even people not diagnosed with mental health problems benefit from therapy. Especially in this day and age.\n\nStay strong OP.", "Of course NTA!!!\nShe sounds TERRIBLE. I'm sorry but she doesn't take care of your health, and yeah, mental health is health. PERIOD.", "NTA\n\nHer treatment of you is not ok. Push through and get the counseling you need. It's actually very mature of you to fight for that for yourself and knowing that you need that (although personally I think everyone could benefit from going to counseling). \n\nKeep your head up and keep fighting for yourself. You are not in the wrong and she should not have shamed you like that.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nI'm sorry your mom hasn't been more supportive. Good for you for recognizing what you need, and fighting for it. Mom was probably hoping you'd drop it, but you persisted. You are a strong young woman who understands the importance of self-care. Be proud of yourself for your strength and perseverance! Looks like you have a lot of people in your corner, cheering you on!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Assuming she signed the paper, the subject is closed.   It might be best to avoid discussing it with her until another signature is needed.", "If you were diagnosed with strep throat, would you be attention-seeking for picking up your antibiotics at the pharmacy?  \n\nYour mother is preventing you from receiving medical attention for a diagnosed with a medical issue.  She is absolutely in the wrong here. \n\nSome people are uncomfortable with the thought of therapy for themselves or their close family members. I don\u2019t know why, I believe it\u2019s often because of an historical stigma associated with psychological issues and their treatment. You know better, so don\u2019t let your mother\u2018s fears keep you from being the best person you can be. \n\nTherapy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re weak. Therapy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re broken. Going to therapy means you\u2019re smart enough to recognize that someone can teach you how to handle your challenges in a better way.\n\nI wonder if your mother has the wrong picture of the therapy you were asking for. You are not asking for counseling because of things that you have experienced. You are asking to have somebody who has been professionally trained, to teach you how to handle the thoughts that happen in your brain due to your depression. The lessons that you can be taught in therapy help you to think about things in a more positive way, and consequently, help to minimize your depression. \n\nDon\u2019t take no for an answer. Ask your mother to sign the form one more time. You are wise to go for therapy. \n\nI wish you all the best. \n\nSending you internet grandma hugs \ud83d\udc75", "NTA. My mom would also balk at any attempt I made for my health, mental or otherwise.

Hopefully, they can help to navigate the appropriate conversations.\n\nGood luck to you", "NTA. But point out to your mom that there are two types of people. Ones who suffer, and then think you should suffer because they had to. Ones who suffer, and are so glad to know you don't have to, because they know what it's like. She's not the second kind. Go get your counseling and props for recognizing there is a problem and BIG props for being proactive...which is impossibly hard with depression!!!!!", "NTA your mother is an AH. Really good for you seeking help so young! I hope you feel better soon\u2764\ufe0f", "Nta & well done you on being so active in getting help, that motivation can be so hard with depression. Your mum unfortunately doesn't & may never understand & while it's not great it's OK. There is support out there from friends or maybe groups online. You might be surprised at how people can build amazing bonds when they are working at healing & towards the same goal.", "God kids are soft now.", "ESH"]}
