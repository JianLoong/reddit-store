Not once have you considered what's best for your stepdaughter.

You were fine with the arrangement until your son started throwing tantrums. Now you want to destroy your step daughters relationship with her family members to avoid these tantrums instead of teaching your son that he doenst get his way by acting like this. Yes, it sucks for him, but its not an unusual situation. Load of families today are mixed, with children having different sets of aunt/uncles/grand parents etc. This situation is no different than those. Instead of taking gifts away from your stepdaughter, teach your son that his sister has different family than he does (I know not biological but for all intent and purposes they are not family) and that he can try to be nice to his sister and help her out with stuff and she will maybe let him play with her stuff when she isn't using it. Forcing her to share will just create resentment and further reluctance to share.\n\nIt would be great if all things in life were fair and equal, but they are not. Your stepdaughter gets a TV, and your son gets to be raised by both of his parents, what can you do?", "YTA.

Everybody here is vindictive and immature.  To buy your daughter a tv to isolate her ps5 from your son is sleazy and manipulative.  Obviously your daughter told them the sitch and they reacted to it.  I would not allow them to buy anything for your daughter without approval from you.\n\nMy opinion is that this situation, if left unchecked, will get VERY bad for you as your daughter sees her aunts/uncles as an oasis.  They've been parenting without any of the responsibility.  That they call her their \"child\" is disturbing.\n\nFor the future of your relationship with your daughter and harmony in your family, the time to get all the players, sans children, in a room and hash this out is nigh.

You cannot punish the stepdaughter for having family members in her life and she doesn\u2019t need to share, you need to parent better. Let her have the things her family buys her and stop forcing her to share things she doesn\u2019t want to share. You are breeding resentment by how you are handling things and it\u2019s not ok for either kid.

It sounds like you (and your husband) have made the wrong decision every step of the way.

Clearly he thought they were reasonable enough to be allowed unsupervised access to a young child. A 4yo would adjust to a change in family circumstances much better than a 14yo. There\u2019s no way to unring that bell now. You can stop her from visiting but if they\u2019re willing to take her in, she will move in with them within a few years. If your other child is living in near poverty like you seem to be trying to claim, you need to take responsibility for that as well.  Explain that there\u2019s no Santa to your kid if that\u2019s what\u2019s causing most of his distress; 6 isn\u2019t a terrible age to find out.", "YTA. First off at least they still love your stepdaughter after how you treated them. You and your husband chose to cut ties with them instead of working things out so your son in the end did lose out but that was your choice. Now that you see how much they are involved in getting her nice things you whined and complained using your son as an excuse now your trying to force your stepdaughter not to have a relationship with them. Guess what she is 14 and in a few years will cut ties herself with you and her dad have fun.", "YTA. \n\nAll you\u2019re doing is souring and probably in the long term ending the relationship with your stepdaughter.

In four years, she\u2019ll be 18, and they\u2019ll probably be able to afford her college tuition.

First, you did a very bad job in the post stating that this is the Uncle and Aunt and not the grandparents. Most people think you are trying to separate grandkids from grandparents for these issues. In reality, it's an aunt and uncle with too much free money on hand, and honeslty not as important. Second, why did you allow your Step-Daughter to stay in contact with such people. You inadvertently have created a situation where she is being influenced by an outside force who isn't parenting but promoting behavioral issues through a blank check.  She is getting items that are not only expensive but hard to get. Meaning that in many ways, they are undermining your parenting style but also bribing her. They may not mean it (or they do and they relish in it), but they are creating issues in your family by doing what they are doing. You do realize that the TV things mean your daughter ran to them knowing she would get/solve the issue? You messed up letting it get this far, (don't tell me that this is the first time they bought expensive gifts because if it they are definitely bribing/manipulating your daughter) but you also messed up not realizing the consequences. Your daughter may be a pawn in a game that you may have just lost because of your inability to pull the issue by the root. Your husband has been spineless in this also by not stepping up against his own brother and stopping this from the beginning. The stepdaughter should have been removed from the situation once you knew they were snobby. Clearly, your husband agrees, so why continue? Because of a sense of family?

I know people do have young kids that game, but like what is your specific reason? Can you buy your son his own controller so nothing breaks? Can\u2019t you just state video games are for when you are older like 10/11? \n\n3) Yes you helped create this dynamic. All adults helped create this dynamic. It seems like your son doesn\u2019t care to know the in-laws and only upset about the material things. Also material gifts should differ between a 14 year old and a 6 year old.  More expensive items do go to those that are older.  Honestly it\u2019s that simple, but I understand why the son is upset because of the age he\u2019s at\u2026..however you need to make it clear she has independent relationships.  If he\u2019s crying extensively due to gifts then yes that\u2019s a tantrum, and that\u2019s on you and your husband to figure out a way to explain why.  If he\u2019s stuck on Santa, then make it a big deal to do Family gifts at one time and Santa gifts another- separate it. Also,Just like he has friends that would give him presents but not his sister, it\u2019s the same.  But unfortunately you and your husband will need to actually communicate the truth to your son eventually.  Not now but eventually. How you acted (the good, bad, and ugly) along with everyone else.  Don\u2019t try to make yourself appear better than you were, because your son WILL want to know about why the in laws don\u2019t care about him.  He will ask.  And your SD will probably tell the truth as she knows it too.  \n\n4) Yes you could say it\u2019s unfair for the in laws not to give gifts (which seems to be the only thing you care about) but they don\u2019t know your son.  Honestly what you should be sad about is how your SD has a relationship with your husband\u2019s side of the family that your son doesn\u2019t have.  You should want your son to know and have connections with your husband\u2019s side of the family\u2026\u2026but alas you are focused on gifts. By focusing on material gifts and putting that ultimatum in place (either both kids get expensive gifts or no one does)\u2026.you did portray yourself as a gold digger for lack of a better word.  You focused on the material wealth and for your son to have it, and so I can see that painting you in a continuing unflattering light that will continue to impact your son with that side of the family.  The reason for the expensive gifts is due to the SD age but mainly that connection.  If you focused on the connection and relationship for your son and the in-laws, from the beginning it may have been different.  Or not who knows? But time travel isn\u2019t a thing yet.  However, the flip side of this argument could be you were happy and condoning this whole dynamic for 5/6 years. Only once your son wanted more expensive gifts did all of a sudden you have a problem with it.

I was going to try to be more delicate about this, but after reading your comments, I see that delicate isn't going to be enough. Follow me through how you made this happen. \n\n1. You admit you were rude to them. You've now changed your story, saying they were rude to you first, but based on what you said, you went in with a chip on your shoulder because they were wealthy. You weren't friendly and they wondered what the hell was going on and if you were just there for money, because you surely weren't there to be a part of their family since you yourself admit you couldn't even be bothered to try being friendly. \n\n2. You've behaved so delightfully that they don't want anything to do with you and your husband, the man who has enabled you. \n\n3. Because of this, they don't want to be around or meet your son because that would involve inviting you back into their lives. They will not cut off your stepdaughter because they have an established bond with her, but you have behaved so nicely that they won't have your son in their lives because that would mean putting up with you and your husband.\n\n4. Rather than accept this as a consequence of YOUR actions, you're now here moaning that your son doesn't get presents from them. Not once in the 6 years of his life have you tried to mend the relationship, but you want them to send him gifts. You wonder why they wondered if you were after money, but you're making it clear that you don't care about fixing things with them, you just want your son to be given fancy gifts. They apparently aren't good enough for you to deign to get on with, but they should still be spending their money giving your son the things you can. That is both delusional and grasping.\n\n\n5. Rather than explain to your son that your step-daughter has family he doesn't and that he won't always get as many presents as her, you allow him to have a tantrum. It's fascinating that when she is rightly upset at you taking her family away from her, she's having a tantrum, but when he's whining because he doesn't have enough presents, that isn't a tantrum at all. I don't expect you to understand why that is hypocritical and a problem, as you are here having your own tantrum about presents, but it is an issue. \n\n6. You demand she shares everything. Yes, children should be taught to share, but that's not what you're doing. What you're doing is saying, \"You have to give your things to your brother in order to compensate for the mess I've made.\" No, she shouldn't be forced to share her food, her console, or her TV. They are gifts for her. If she chooses to share, great, but if not, you leave it alone. She doesn't have to sacrifice because your attitude and behaviour have deprived your son of his family. That's for you to either fix or deal with. \n\n7. Because you haven't shown you're selfish and entitled enough, you've decided that your step-daughter now has to be deprived of her family as well. If your son is hurting, so must she. These people love her and she loves them, and you want to cut them out of her life out of spite. You think if you take them away from her, they'll knuckle under; you are weaponising your step-daughter. You also likely think she'll blame them or make your case to them because she'll miss them, but guess what? The only people she'll blame are you and your husband, and why shouldn't she?\n\nYou created this situation. If this is a window into have you've behaved in general, you are selfish, thoughtless, and you seem not to give a damn about anyone else's feelings but those of your biological child and yourself. You are now punishing a child for your actions. \n\nLet me tell you how this will go if you don't stop being so damn selfish: your step-daughter will resent the three of you. She'll resent you and your husband for taking away the people she loves, and your son because you've made it clear that you're doing it because of him. \n\nOnce she's old enough, she'll move away, and you won't hear from her. She'll reunite with her uncles and aunts, and you'll be lucky if you get to watch her life from afar. She may not want you around any kids she has because you may try to pull this same crap with them, complaining about them getting presents from those aunts and uncles and trying to make her pick a side. \n\nAnd it will all be yours and your husband's fault. It won't be that they twisted her against you, it will be that you hurt her so terribly that she could not forgive you. You started poisoning your relationship with her when you started resenting her for having a bond with her aunts and uncles and demanded she share her gifts (the food is included as a gift as it was bought specially for her). Now you may well have killed that relationship even if you back down, because she's seen that you will hurt her to get at them. \n\nStop blaming other people. You caused this mess. Stop punishing her for your actions. Explain to your 6 year old that he doesn't get everything that he wants, that sometimes people will have things he doesn't and he just has to deal with it.

Thinking everything should always be equal breeds entitled adults who cry when they don't get what they want. Forcing children to be equal (especially when they are almost 10 years apart) teaches the child who is forced to do the sharing (the SD here) that they don't get to have boundaries and don't get to have autonomy over  their own gifts and belongings. The step daughter has a second family. Usually it would be the birth mother's family, but it is the aunt and uncle here (she doesn't have contact with birth mothers family). If OP wanted to help her son understand, she could just explain that she get gifts from her other family. If it was the birth mother buying these gifts, it would be crazy to demand she have a relationship with the son and buy gifts for him. The son has no relationship with the in laws. He hasn't met them, he doesn't know who they are. He is six, lie to him about who they are if it makes it easier. But the world isn't equal, it isn't fair, and teaching kids that it should be is a bad choice. \n\nA teenager is likely to get more expensive gifts, even in the same household because they can properly maintain expensive items, little kids tend to break things.

My first thought is to let her continue to see them but lay down rules on gifts. The three options that I think are reasonable are to say: 1) no extravagant gifts (maybe a dollar threshold like $100-$200 or something?) OR 2) they need to start including the son OR 3) the daughter needs to share gifts with the son. \n\nThere is a lot going on here that will be hard to fix, but I think the piece that OP and her husband need to deal with most directly is the relationship between the siblings. I feel like 14 is too old to throw a tantrum over having to share.

I'm saying this as someone who thought her (dating) in-laws were stone cold assholes who didn't give a crap about me or the fact I'm an important part of their sons life, turns out I just hadn't spent enough time with them, his grandparents even call me mija (endearing Spanish term meaning \"my daughter\" for those that may not know) so I just think ESH, and should do what this parent comment here says", "I don't see how them saying they want nothing to do with their own young nephew out of spite and spoiling their niece could result in us thinking they're NTA.", "Abusers lie and the fact that the \"clarifications\" are total 180s from the initial claims is just more evidence for them being bullshit.  If the claims in the comments were true they'd have been in the main post because they would've given her the sympathy angle she's trying to claw back after getting called out based on her original post.", "No, it\u2019s normal to encourage sharing. It\u2019s terrible when you force someone to share their personal gifts. It teaches them that they don\u2019t truly own their possessions and that they aren\u2019t entitled to say no.", "> Then why make the agreement that it\u2019s ok for them to have NC with any other child besides the SD\n\nThey didn't. \n\n>I didn't stop my in laws from having a relationship with my son, it was THEIR choice. We tried to invite them to meet our son but they refused.\n\n>My husband has even been trying to fix things with them, he loves his family and is hurting a lot by not seeing them but they don't want to fix things\n\nThe in-laws are the ones causing the problem, and after six years, it has gotten bad enough to reach an impasse.\n\nIt's an untenable situation to continue to allow a child to be treated with neglect and disdain after so long of trying to reach a solution, to the point where the child is actively aware and hurt by it, with the divide of the treatments only becoming more exacerbated. \n\nThe uncle and aunt are the ones who suck for treating their nephew like a non-person who doesn't matter.", "I'm more concerned that the post I replied to got so much support...", "Yeah exactly, that's treating him like dirt. You don't reject a child and spoil his sister just for the sin of existing.", "Yep. It never should have been allowed. She was raised to be this way, and now OP is realizing her permissiveness also harmed her son.", "That may be true but let's be real once she's 18 and out of the house I doubt the IL are going to continue with the lavish gifts since there are no little kids to hurt in the process. They are doing all this to create issues in their brother's home. Once she's of age the fun will be gone and now this girl will have a strained relationship with her immediate family and have to contend with the fact, she was used as a pawn by her aunts and uncles.", "> Does \"snob\" mean they don't put up with her trash behavior?\n\nIt pretty clearly does and it's good on them for it.  People like OP are not worth the effort to keep in your life.  Honestly it's damned good on them that they've tried to hard to retain their relationship with OP's stepdaughter.  Hopefully they'll be a refuge for her when she turns 18 and gets out of that shitty household.", "It's not just her son it's also their biological nephew. They are shit stirrers and you all are taking the bait cause you hate stepmother. \n\nThey are 100% related to her son. They don't want to recognize a relationship with their biological nephew because of their beef with their mom is bullshit. this is favoritism and they are TRYING to create discord in that household.", "It's not OPs position to say anything in regards to the daughter.  It's on her husband. He fucked up by allowing OP to combative w/ his siblings, because quite honestly it sounds like she started this shit in the first place.", "Out of spite.", "AITA is misandrist as hell, this is a classic reverse the genders and watch the judgments change moment.", "She *did* say both sides were to blame for the feud.\n\nThe idea that everything is OP's fault because she was not nice on their first meeting is bonkers.", "Owning and using are different things. Someone can own something and still allow others to use it.\n\nYou can say no to strangers, but refusing to share toys with your siblings makes you, in my opinion, selfish.", "I know. People in the comments are being insane.", "Lmao going over her parents head? At the most she probably complained she\u2019s sharing her present for her, with a first grade or kindergarten sibling, so they decided next holiday to get her a tv so she can enjoy her gift months later alone.", ">It's not OPs position to say anything in regards to the daughter.\n\nThat's her daughter though. Or are stepchildren suddenly not real family?", ">They refused to meet the son after years of poor behavior and judgement on the mother's part.\n\nSource on the \"years of poor behavior and judgement\"?\n\nAlso (can't believe I actually have to say this), but just because you dislike someone's parents doesn't give you carte blanche to treat their kids like shit.", "Well, the family rule can be that the PS stays in the living room to be shared. They don't have to give in to manipulation. They can also make the TV shared in another room. The daughter will be upset, but it's the only way to be fair. She needs to understand what's going on. NTA", "Oh, I think the TV was more than that. I think the siblings-in-law are trying to distance the stepdaughter from OP and win stepdaughter over to their side of the dispute. They're also undermining the OP's authority. \"What? Mommy says you have to share with your monster of a half-brother\\*? We'll show Mommy! Have a TV! Now, who do you like best, mean ol' Mommy or generous, cool Aunts and Uncles?\"\n\n\\*They'll always emphasize that he isn't her full brother.\n\nI'll round up and designate OP as NTA. Obviously the husband's siblings are, and hub sounds like he needs to grow a spine.", "Source: the mother admitted it, while trying to couch in in terms of both sides fighting but admitting she repeatedly instigated it.", ">The in laws are literally playing games with the kids. They couldn't even let the nephew they refuse to meet play with the ps5 they got the step daughter?", "You're right, the time to deal with this was ten years ago. If OP and father had thought it through then they should have seen something like this coming. Now it's all fucked because it's not fair the son gets nothing and it's also not fair to make the daughter share and it's not fair to cut the daughter's contact with her family. They were supposed to come to a solution long before it got to this point.", "I'm not saying she's a bad person, I'm saying this isn't great. Just because something (not wanting to share something with your sibling) can be normal and common doesn't make it right. The problem here is made worse by the fact that her brother is being treated unfairly.\n\nEdit because you edited : My younger brother is way younger than I am and I absolutely shared things with him.", ">But OP showed no need to fix things until she realized a 6 year old is throwing tantrums. \n\nYou call *throwing tantrums* a 6-year old child crying because he thinks Santa hates him ?", "The thing is she never says they don\u2019t get him gifts, just upset they helped her not share one of hers which I think is under stable with the age difference.", "So when a 14 year old shares her concern that her brother might break her PS5 it is a tantrum?", "I know exactly what it's like, I have a blended family that at this point needs flow charts to follow.  OP is 100% the sole problem here (well, her hubby's total spinelessness in letter her run roughshod I suppose is a 2nd one) since she herself admits that she's been hostile to her inlaws since literally day one.  Her inlaws have every right to refuse to put up with her shit and the fact her response to having her games shut down was to get even more hostile just reinforces that OP's the entire problem.", ">It is now a problem for us because my son has started to notice that he is being treated unfairly. He hasn't even met my in laws. All he knows is that his sister gets a lot of good gifts for christmas birthdays and other occasions and he doesn't.\n\nBased on that it's pretty clear they're not offering him anything.", "It's got nothing to do with what I just wrote.\n\nBut yeah, actually, it could, depending on the way she went about it."]}
