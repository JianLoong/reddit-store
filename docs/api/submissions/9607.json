Because your stepdaughter already has an existing, good relationship with her grandparents and you just cut that off completely because stepdaughter didn't want to share her PS5 with her 6 year old brother, who she correctly said, would end up breaking it. You also tried to force her by \"It's MY TV you'll be using\", creating an \"US vs stepdaughter\" situation, which will also backfire on you. So, SD got her own TV as a gift.

Not once have you considered what's best for your stepdaughter.

You were fine with the arrangement until your son started throwing tantrums. Now you want to destroy your step daughters relationship with her family members to avoid these tantrums instead of teaching your son that he doenst get his way by acting like this. Yes, it sucks for him, but its not an unusual situation. Load of families today are mixed, with children having different sets of aunt/uncles/grand parents etc. This situation is no different than those. Instead of taking gifts away from your stepdaughter, teach your son that his sister has different family than he does (I know not biological but for all intent and purposes they are not family) and that he can try to be nice to his sister and help her out with stuff and she will maybe let him play with her stuff when she isn't using it. Forcing her to share will just create resentment and further reluctance to share.\n\nIt would be great if all things in life were fair and equal, but they are not. Your stepdaughter gets a TV, and your son gets to be raised by both of his parents, what can you do?", "YTA.

This is, of course, absurd and a group of adults should have been able to work out something more, well, adult.\n\nSo, now that this situation is out of hand, it's time to have that long overdue tete-a-tete.  Everybody here is vindictive and immature.  To buy your daughter a tv to isolate her ps5 from your son is sleazy and manipulative.  Obviously your daughter told them the sitch and they reacted to it.  I would not allow them to buy anything for your daughter without approval from you.\n\nMy opinion is that this situation, if left unchecked, will get VERY bad for you as your daughter sees her aunts/uncles as an oasis.  They've been parenting without any of the responsibility.  That they call her their \"child\" is disturbing.\n\nFor the future of your relationship with your daughter and harmony in your family, the time to get all the players, sans children, in a room and hash this out is nigh.

Let her have the things her family buys her and stop forcing her to share things she doesn\u2019t want to share. You are breeding resentment by how you are handling things and it\u2019s not ok for either kid.

It sounds like you (and your husband) have made the wrong decision every step of the way.

Clearly he thought they were reasonable enough to be allowed unsupervised access to a young child. A 4yo would adjust to a change in family circumstances much better than a 14yo. There\u2019s no way to unring that bell now. You can stop her from visiting but if they\u2019re willing to take her in, she will move in with them within a few years. If your other child is living in near poverty like you seem to be trying to claim, you need to take responsibility for that as well.  Explain that there\u2019s no Santa to your kid if that\u2019s what\u2019s causing most of his distress; 6 isn\u2019t a terrible age to find out.", "YTA. First off at least they still love your stepdaughter after how you treated them. You and your husband chose to cut ties with them instead of working things out so your son in the end did lose out but that was your choice. Now that you see how much they are involved in getting her nice things you whined and complained using your son as an excuse now your trying to force your stepdaughter not to have a relationship with them.

In four years, she\u2019ll be 18, and they\u2019ll probably be able to afford her college tuition.

You have shown that you can tear a family apart through your actions. I wonder if you are able to show your ability to do better. You should all have a conversation like adults and resolve to do better. You blame the in-laws for treating the children differently. You played a major role in creating the context for this.

But you could be making less of a big deal about the gifts so that your son doesn't notice the disparity.\n\nAlso: YTA because your son probably wouldn't be in this situation if you handled it more maturely, You should have introduced your son to his father's side of the family by now, regardless of whatever comments they made long ago.

First, you did a very bad job in the post stating that this is the Uncle and Aunt and not the grandparents. Most people think you are trying to separate grandkids from grandparents for these issues. In reality, it's an aunt and uncle with too much free money on hand, and honeslty not as important. Second, why did you allow your Step-Daughter to stay in contact with such people. You inadvertently have created a situation where she is being influenced by an outside force who isn't parenting but promoting behavioral issues through a blank check.  She is getting items that are not only expensive but hard to get. Meaning that in many ways, they are undermining your parenting style but also bribing her. They may not mean it (or they do and they relish in it), but they are creating issues in your family by doing what they are doing. You do realize that the TV things mean your daughter ran to them knowing she would get/solve the issue? You messed up letting it get this far, (don't tell me that this is the first time they bought expensive gifts because if it they are definitely bribing/manipulating your daughter) but you also messed up not realizing the consequences. Your daughter may be a pawn in a game that you may have just lost because of your inability to pull the issue by the root. Your husband has been spineless in this also by not stepping up against his own brother and stopping this from the beginning. The stepdaughter should have been removed from the situation once you knew they were snobby. Clearly, your husband agrees, so why continue? Because of a sense of family?

I mean heck, there were cereal boxes with names on them in our pantry. Yes, there was some inequality because among my siblings there were different parents.
