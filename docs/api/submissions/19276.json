They\u2019re not missing anything by waiting till Sat.", "NTA And hold your ground, good job for putting your foot down. \n\nYou are making the correct decision, ask your husband if he would respect anyone else\u2019s wish to wait to see the baby, and would he feel insulted or anything if they asked for space? No\u2026. This is your family and you need to do what\u2019s right, and putting up boundaries now is great\u2026 I wish I could have.. enjoy this time with the little one and all the best to you guys\u2026 you need to be relaxing and not worrying about unnecessary drama rn!", "So very super much NTA.  It's your health and your baby's.  Your husband shouldn't feel he's in the middle... he should be solidly behind you.", "NTA. You have been through the mill and your sweet baby has as well. This time is for both of you to heal and settle into your new life together. She will still be super cute this weekend or next weekend or in a month. They can hold their horses.", "NTA your husband needs to tell them to back off once and for all.", "NTA.  In fact, every time they make a fuss, I would move it out a week.", "NTA. You are trying to find your new normal and pushy grandparents are not a part of that process. Husband needs to put you and baby first, as you are the ones who have been through serious medical complications.", "NTA and of course the MIL is making this about her. Classic narcissist. You and your baby have been through a lot together in such a short period of time. This is your first baby, you are healing yourself, having a baby does a number on our bodies, and thr MIL isn\u2019t respecting your boundaries at all and she should. Your husband should establish boundaries with his mother. As a narcissist she\u2019s going to take that personal, oh well. If she keeps it up, I would go NC with her ass. You baby, and you are the most important right now. No one asked how YOU were doing and feeling. So I\u2019m going to ask, how are you doing, OP? I see you mentioned postpartum? Please make an appt ASAP, PP can be very dangerous and damaging to your well being.", "NTA at all - that sounds horrible and if they can\u2019t understand why you\u2019d want to take a few days to yourself then they need to be made to understand.  Graphic detail of blood loss and tearing if it gets through to them! I would definitely recommend making sure you and your husband get on the same page, rather than having his family driving a wedge between you. My MIL was rabid about grandbabies and it caused drama, because we didn\u2019t have good boundaries at first - better to nip it in the bud now.

There\u2019s a really good reason why some cultures have a tradition of a period of time after a birth before visiting or bringing the baby out in public is allowed.\n\nPersonally I would make them all wait 40 days or more!", "NTA.  Simple as that.", "NTA 100%. This irks me so much. My oldest daughter had this problem with her first baby. He in-laws showed up at the hospital daily, staying for hours and just being really inappropriate. My daughter called me crying, exhausted and in pain. I went to the hospital and cleared everybody out and let everybody they would be able to see the baby at home when my daughter and her husband invited them.", "I didn't really bother reading because no matter what u say the answer will be the same, NTA you have every right to delay visits\n\nI did it with my 28wk preemie tho ppl did visit her in the NICU but that is a very different controlled environment. Once she was discharged we went no contact with family for weeks i don't remember how long but I know it was for awhile they understood we were very anxious and protective atm and the most they wanted to at least buy what we needed and had it mailed to us.\n\nI just had my second and m a Lil lax about it since she is full term no issues I'm still protective just less so, only her mil has visited mostly to pick up our son for her weekend with him and to give us a break ND my husband has only once brought our daughter over so his FIL can see her", "NTA and I don't even need to read your post.

He needs to tell them to stop.", "NTA. You had a baby that was in NICU for respiratory issues, have they had their shots you don\u2019t want that baby to catch anything.

Two days of rest and privacy will go a long way", "2 days won\u2019t really help anything.  Nothing will be healed, nothing will be figured out.  I\u2019m just wondering after so much trauma, and seeing how oP is so specific about days in the post,  how OP thinks less than 2 days is going to make a difference.", "So what do you suggest? Just suck it up now? I think come over in a two days once I've had a moment to breathe is a decent compromise.
