Which of the family members judging you is offering a house for her to live in for free?", "NTA\n\nYou made the expectations clear. She did not follow the rules. If you 5 brothers are so mad about it, where were they to help your mom pay the rent then?", "NTA\n\nDumb for letting her move in to begin with though.\n\nIt's always risky to do business with relatives.\n\nShe has 5 other sons to house her along with siblings.  they could have helped her with the rent so you did not have to cover it alone.

The family can be upset all they want - are they paying the mortgage?", "NTA - she broke lease.", "NTA. You told her you expected her to pay rent like normal. She didn't pay rent.

Thats not your job. (One more time for the people in the back..) it was her job to take care of you. Regardless of the circumstances of how you came into money, its your money!

She ignored that, and I got legal authorities involved and had her escorted out.\n\nSounds like you were professional about it.

I can't stand double standards, they make me sick.", "wow I don't know. this one is a tough one but looking at it objectively, your mom brought this on herself for not being responsible with money.

She is irresponsible, and she and the rest of the family expected you to let her stay for free. \n\nHowever, while you are not the AH, did you ever screw the pooch on this one! First, never rent to family or friends, unless you know they have a great track record. And even then, people do lose jobs/become sick, etc. Evicting a stranger is a hell of a lot easier that evicting your *mother* \n\nYou knew, knew, knew she was crap with money, and you let her move in anyway. Maybe she shouldn't have to live with 3 other people, but she doesn't need an entire HOUSE to herself. \n\nYou could have: not told her about the rental, or told her you already had tenants moving in. Definitely stop sharing your financial info with your idiot family. \n\nCongrats on owning 2 houses! You need to have a written lease for the next tenant(s), do a walk through at move in and move out, take photos of the state of the house before and after, and do credit checks! Your mother certainly wouldn't have passed if she were a stranger.\n\nAs to your horrid family, ignore them. They all know the score: she is a nightmare with money.

Mom needs financial counseling and possibly even someone else to handle her bills and give her spending money.  Your five brothers and all your aunts and uncles are welcome to let her freeload off them.  Your rental property is an investment.

I'm guessing you even just kicked her out and aren't going after her for the 3 months of back rent.  You don't love money.  You just realize that your investment needs to be generating money so you don't go into debt.  Did it ever occur to your family that without rent money coming in, you wouldn't be able to pay taxes on the property, pay for insurance on the property, or do maintenance on the property?
