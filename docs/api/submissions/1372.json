I do think it is important to add that my dad does spend a decent amount of money on alcohol and/or cigarettes, I would say he is addicted to the latter. The amounts he usually borrows are not that high (I think) for 10% interest to be a lot, the typical amount is anywhere between 40-120 I would say. His job can depend on the weather heavily and his boss is inconsistent with pay. \n\nMe and my dad do have a pretty good relationship outside of the money lending.

He's trying to keep a roof over your 14 yo head and his boss isn't consistent in paying him. If he abuses the lending and doesn't pay you back, then start charging interest, maybe after a set time, like a week. I get you don't want him spending your money on alcohol or cigarettes because you want him healthy, so maybe ask him to please only put it to household needs. All that said, you, my friend, should go into banking, finance or sales when you're figuring out what to do with your life!", "INFO - How old are you?  Are you a student or are your working? Do you live with your Dad?", "YTA- if your dad is asking for money bc he\u2019s struggling financially to pay bills and keep a roof over your head, by making him pay 10% extra / double, your putting all of you in less financial security.  \n\nBy all means refuse to lend him money if he\u2019s not paying you back but be a bit mindful of your situation. You\u2019re 14 and your money is your money, but you\u2019re not a child anymore & whilst the house finances are not your issue, you are old enough to be in tune with what\u2019s going on- I\u2019d be more concerned why he has to keep borrowing money\u2026 perhaps he needs to be connected to local services and provisions rather than your babysitting money.", "Info - how old are you and does the $$ he borrow provide for you life ie- bills for the house you live in, groceries for your belly etc.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not a bank. Nobody should be borrowing money from you to begin with. If someone wants money and you\u2019re not comfortable giving them that amount as a gift, tell them no.\n\nHOWEVER. If it\u2019s someone you really can\u2019t just drop contact with completely, like a close family member, and they won\u2019t take \u201cno\u201d for an answer, yeah charge them all the interest you want. If you can\u2019t spare the money as a gift and someone continues to ask you for it, they\u2019re showing you zero respect", "I would say YTA but you're 14?? Your Dad should not be borrowing money from a 14 year old. So, NTA I guess?", "If the point of the interest is to discourage him from borrowing from you at all, NTA, although it would be better if you just stopped loaning him money completely.  Let him go beg from someone else.\n\nIf your intent is to take advantage of someone who obviously can't keep their shit straight, YTA.\n\nPlus depending on what country you're in you might be running afoul of usury laws if he wanted to make an issue of it - in most US states for example, 5% annually is the cutoff.\n\nInterest on between-family loans is for large one-time \"I'm helping you with debt\" type of stuff, typically where the loaner would be getting some sort of return on the money if they hadn't loaned it to someone.  It's not for spotting someone a $20 until payday.\n\nEdit:  You're 14.  Stop loaning him money.  Period.", "YTA\nIf the only thing you can think about when your dad asks for money to buy food is Interest you need therapy.", "YTA. If you don't want to give your dad money for whatever reason say no. Don't charge him for it. By charging him interest all you are doing is making him more likely to need to borrow more money sooner.", "Does he provide you with a home? Food? Clothes? Warm bed? TV? \n\nIt is disrespectful when you are living at home and depending on him for so much.

I was biased at first because my dad \"borrowed\" money from me a lot and never paid it back, but it was always for horse racing bets. I didn't have much choice at the time as I was a minor.\n\nDoes your dad pay you back when he borrows? If it's for things like food and electric, I think you should be more understanding. Do you guys have a bad relationship?", "NTA. Those are your terms. If he doesn\u2019t like it, he can stop mooching off his child. You didn\u2019t mention your age, but if your dad is only 38, you can\u2019t be very old.", "Well, if you\u2019re going to do that, you might as well tell your dad to go get a loan.\n\nThey\u2019ll screw your dad over the same way you are doing, except there\u2019s a contract involved and they\u2019ll probably be much nicer to him unless he falls seriously delinquent and ends up with a shiny new Judgment on his credit file.\n\nCharging your dad interest is honestly a stupid idea. You aren\u2019t a loan company and you don\u2019t have any business need to make a profit off of his payments. If you see your relationship with your dad purely as a business transaction then you have bigger problems than your dad probably does.\n\nAnd\u2026 oh yeah. You\u2019re a huge AH.", "YTA. 10% interest is ridiculously high where I live. And doubling it if he doesn't pay back on time? Do you also send a couple guys with baseball bats to \"have a word\" with him?? \n\nEither loan him money or don't, but what you're doing is exploitation.", "NTA BUT I think you should stop loaning him money and maybe ask if there\u2019s a smaller bill you can help out with in a year or two, you still should have some time to be a kid, and He shouldn\u2019t be asking his child for money for his wants (drinking and smoking).", "I am 14, I go to school with that age obviously and with work its sort of baby or pet sitting for neighbours.", "90% of the time he does pay back, with food and electric I get where you're coming from for sure and do on some occasions not have the interest, typically if his boss hasn't paid him on time. I'm kind of under the impression that he should not spend as much money on alcohol and cigarettes and manage his money better if he doesn't want to pay my terms.", "Now I get it, you\u2019re a kid.\n\nI\u2019m even more confused why the heck your dad is borrowing from his 14 year old kid. Does this dude have a job?", "NTA - Dad needs to to take responsibility for his own finances and should not be dependent on his 14-year-old child to make ends meet - Especially if he\u2019s spending the money on alcohol and cigarettes.  I might feel a little differently if this was about being able to feed the family.", "Can I ask if you giving him this money puts you in a bad financial position? Are you left short when he borrows and can you support yourself? You didn't put your age in the post, are you an adult or minor?", "Yeah, but his job and boss can be a bit inconsistent with pay at times and he buys alcohol and cigarettes which are both expensive obviously.", "OP is 14", "Well, he needs to get a better paying job like any other adult so you can keep your money. You don\u2019t need to be giving your dad your money so he can go throw it all away on a bunch of crap he doesn\u2019t need.", "OH. That changes my perspective a little. I don't think a parent should be relying on their 14 year old for money IMHO. I've been in that position and it's not a nice one."]}
