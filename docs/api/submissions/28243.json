I'll share *my own* story to bolster your strength in keeping the watch.\n\nTL;DR, my family had issues. My mom hated my dad which extended to my dad's side of the family. She never wanted to see my dad happy and trying to keep me away from my uncles, his brothers, seemed like a good game for her to play for her sick jollies.\n\nIt didn't work as well as she would've liked, but it was hard. I couldn't spend time with them like I wanted, but I connected with my 2 uncles the best I could before the age of the internet.\n\nI was especially fond of uncle Bill. In my dad's side of the family, (we're from Texas), the men had all attended Texas A&M, a famous Southern US university, and they were *very proud of this fact*. When anyone graduates from any US university, you have a chance to buy a \"class ring\" to show you had attended and graduated school there. Texas A&M students, known as \"Aggies\", are very serious about their \"Aggie rings\", their class ring showing they attended Texas A&M. My dad was so serious about his that when he got married, he got a thin gold wedding band and welded it to his Aggie ring so he never had to take it off to make room for his wedding band.\n\nI wanted to go to A&M but my mom knew it would make my dad happy and proud, and since she offered to cover my university fees, she forbade me to go, out of spite for my dad, and made me attend the state university in our hometown. I was heartbroken but my mother was a force to be reckoned with, so I had to do as I was told.\n\nWhen uncle Bill passed away, he left me just two things, his relatively new laptop (a marvelous thing for its time!) and his Aggie ring. I was humbled! I now had an Aggie ring of my own, in honour of my lovely uncle Bill! It was given to me at his funeral by my dad, actually. It was too big for any of my fingers so I took a gold necklace I had and I hung it from that, wearing it proudly around my neck.\n\nAwhile later, a woman and her teenage daughter came up to me. I'd never seen her before in my *life* but apparently she was \"family\". She saw uncle Bill's ring on my necklace and gave me a squinty look. \"So *that's* where it went.\" she said snidely. She must've looked his hands over in the casket to see that he wasn't being buried with the ring.\n\nI asked, \"Where *what* went?\" She continued snidely, \"Bill's Aggie ring.\" I got a *very* smug look on my face and said, \"Oh yes. Uncle Bill *expressly* told *his brother*, *my father*, to give me this ring. He knew I would cherish it and wear it with pride for him.\" She gave a snooty, \"Hmph!\" and wandered away, never to be seen again.\n\n*DO NOT GIVE UP YOUR WATCH!* See it as a duty to ensure it's kept by someone who will love and cherish it for the memories of who it came from and as you say, not become a pawn shop treasure meant to help keep the lights on. I'll be buried with uncle Bill's ring, dammit! I have no family to pass it onto so I'll keep it with me for the love and respect of Billy Joe Ross. :D", "Because she wouldn\u2019t have given it to him.

For all I know, my grandfather told my grandmother to give it to me before he died. \n\nEither way, your assumption is wrong.

My dad was the executor and told her no and to not ask me.  She went to the probate lawyer who also told her no and explained that those items were gifts to me while grandpa was still alive and were therefore, exempt from the estate.  She tried to take the jewelry back but was stopped by my dogs (one dog was in my bedroom between the door and the jewelry box and the other dog was behind my aunt in the hall).  When the dogs started losing their minds my dad and I went to check and saw my aunt still trying to get into my room while one dog was blocking the door and the other was growling behind her.
