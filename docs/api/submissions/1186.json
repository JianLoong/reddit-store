You chose to engage and reply with a personal insult. \n\nThe teacher should not have commented on drama between parents or taken sides. You should not have responded by insulting her grammar (which was irrelevant to what she had said). \n\nI understand the impulse to snap back when you feel insulted but you are not being the bigger person by always responding with a meaner personal insult in tuner.", "YTA.

You need to dial up your empathy and consider what you are teaching your children.  YTA.", "YTA, sort of. I always had to refrain from wanting to correct spelling, grammar, and syntax errors on school memos and messages. But recognize that people who teach elementary school need a different skill set than people whose jobs require a higher level of literacy. I agree with you that raising children is best done as a team sport. I admire people who do it well on their own, but you are not even half way through it, so you might want to keep your confidence on the safe side of smugness.", "\"I asked her if she's being helpful with her grammar and spelling errors in her class emails.

I fucking hate people who correct grammar.\n\nIf you understand what's being said, the grammar doesn't matter in an email. (to an extent of course).\n\nI always find people who correct grammar usually don't have a leg to stand on, and are just so dimwitted that they think pointing out the difference between \"their\" and \"there\" makes them win the argument.\n\nYTA.", "ESH this is a stupid contest. It's hard being a single parent, leave it at that and help each other out.", "YTA. That comment to the single mom was rude and unnecessary. Then you doubled down and was rude and petty with the teacher.", "NTA.\n\nParents cant go running to their child's teacher because of another adult. Also if she took that as you telling her she's lazy then that is on her. She obviously knows it's true and got offended by it.\n\nAlso no reason for a teacher to mingle in parent stuff that has nothing to do with the child or education. I'd be petty too if she didn't have correct grammar teaching MY CHILD. ATP move schools lol", "ESH. The other mom\u2019s comment evidently struck a nerve with you and understandably so. Being a single parent is hard in general so there\u2019s no need to have a d*ck measuring contest over it. But just as she shouldn\u2019t have judged your parenting situation, you shouldn\u2019t have judged hers by assuming that she\u2019s lazy - you don\u2019t know everything about her situation just as she doesn\u2019t know everything about yours. I can see the teacher was just trying to moderate any issues that could lead to an uncomfortable environment but yes it could\u2019ve been said in a less condescending way (if she truly said it in a \u201cdo you think\u2026\u201d kind of way). But, it\u2019s also not fair to her that you\u2019re taking your frustration about the mom\u2019s comment out on her.

Your teacher took it upon herself to weigh in on a conversation that she was not a part of; it was none of her business.  \n\nYou prolly need to dial it back when talking to other \"single parents.\"  Everyone's experience is different.  Judging this other mom was not a good move on your part, but hey, not everyone gets along all the time.\n\nIMO, that single-mom is the A H  for not taking her lumps and leaving it alone.  If she's told the school teacher, you can bet she's told several other parents at the school.  \n\nOkay, you come off as snarky when you're criticizing the teacher's grammar/spelling errors.  Yet, those errors are there, and I would question the qualifications of a teacher with errors in a simple email - and whether I would want my child taught by such a person.\n\nI've read other comments calling you the A H and criticizing your \"social skills.\"  I don't understand where they're coming from.", "Teacher could have minded her own business. If she cannot, then she'll have accept that people will not lie down for her to just so she can bully them.

There are double standards for everyone.", "I\u2019m confused why the single mom went to tattle to the teacher, as if the teacher has any sort of real authority over the parents.
