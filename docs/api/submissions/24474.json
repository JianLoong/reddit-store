Look, I\u2019m a fat guy, I know going up in size can feel embarrassing. But part of maturity is confronting uncomfortable facts and adjusting to them. A person needs clothes that fit. It doesn\u2019t sound like anyone\u2019s forcing him to throw out his old clothes; if he wants to keep them around as motivation to lose weight, fine. But even if he goes on a strict diet and workout plan, losing weight takes time. During that period of time, he needs fitting clothing.", "NTA. Not only doing laundry everyday is a pain, but washing the same clothes everyday will wear them and they'll look old in no time. He needs more clothes to rotate so they last and he won't end up having nothing at all to wear.", "He earns enough money that he can buy a couple of outfits \"for now\" to make things more comfortable and professional, even if he intends to fit into his old clothes again in a few months. \n\n(I don't believe he will, but you don't have to tell him that part)", "NTA - only do the usual number of washes a week. If he refuses to buy more clothes, he can wash his own clothes on the remaining days.", "I understand his reasoning. If he buys new workwear in a larger size it's like admitting he's not able to lose the weight and makes him feel like a failure.\n\nBut he needs new clothes now and can afford them.\n\nHe can get clothes that fit now and donate them when he fits back into his normal clothes. He could think of it as an act of charity. For the money he spends he will get a certain length of time of use and you will get less stress trying to keep his workwear clean. Then when he's finished with them he can donate them which is a great thing to do since larger sizes are sought after in thrift stores.\n\nIt's like a sort of rental fee with the feelgood factor of helping someone else out afterwards.", "He doesn't want to buy more clothes because he isn't willing to admit he's gained weight. While we can all sympathize, his actions affect you, not just him. It's unreasonable to do laundry every day. Besides that,  his co-workers may think he only has one pair of pants and a shirt and they won't think he's washing them every day.  It's time for him to put on his big boy pants and buy more big boy pants. NTA", "NTA - he needs to buy more clothes that fit.  Having only one pair that fits is nonsense.", "Nta.

Doing laundry every single day is not a reasonable expectation. He obviously feels insecure about the weight gain but that's not an excuse to expect you to set aside time every day to wash his clothes. If he keeps refusing to be reasonable, it's time to revisit the laundry agreement.", "NTA, he definitely needs to buy more clothes. It will put some wear on your washer machine.", "NTA. That's a completely reasonable request to make. He should have at least five work outfits, so you're doing laundry no more often than weekly. If he has less, he should resign himself to smelling at work.", "He likely doesn\u2019t want to buy more work clothes that fit him because it will feel like he\u2019s admitting defeat that he is that size now.\n\nNTA. Your request is perfectly reasonable and he\u2019s not thinking logically about it.

You don't have five kids stashed away that you haven't told us about?\n\nIt's completely unreasonable to do laundry every day - you can't possibly generate enough to fill a washing machine every day. In my household, everyone typically does laundry once a week. Your partner needs to arrange his wardrobe to match a reasonable laundry schedule. \n\nPick a day of the week. Tell him you'll do his laundry on that day of the week, and then it's up to him to arrange buying additional clothes or choosing to re-wear things in order to fit in with this.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I would go back to my original laundry schedule.  He can either buy more work clothes, or wear them dirty until laundry day.", "NTA sensitive subject but he\u2019s being unreasonable. Agree with him and say he will the lose weight. You believe that he will and you love him this way and any way. What you cannot do, is laundry every day. Unless he is open to buying more clothes, the current agreement has to change. You are no longer willing to do his laundry in exchange for paying lesser rate.", "NTA. I have started a newish job and have two pairs of chef pants and two chef coats. I will eventually get more, but for now, two sets it is. My wife handles all of the laundry at home. At first, I was bringing home my uniform daily and she was throwing them in, so I would have both sets daily, in case of emergency. (We have laundry at work, but since other chefs have more coats, they don\u2019t do it daily and you can\u2019t count on it being done at any specific time.) My wife mentioned that it wasn\u2019t great for her to have to do a load of laundry every night after I get home. Totally understandable. I started doing them myself. Then, I volunteered to take over laundry at work. Now I can throw the clothes in before I leave and dry them first thing the next day. I know this is a unique situation, but my point is that my uniforms are my responsibility. So, either your husband starts being responsible for washing his own stuff or he gets more. I mean, he is making 100k. Get more!", "More importantly than doing laundry every day, what happens if he rips his work clothes on his way home and can't get to the store before his next shift starts?\n\nThis would cause him to miss work, may have work consequences, he won't have money to replace them when they go, and it could get him fired.\n\nIf he argues that he will have money to replace and won't listen to Murphey's Law use the \"What if the store is out of stock in your size\" argument.", "NTA. Tell him that you can't do the laundry for 1 shirt and 1 pair of pants. You will do the laundry X times a week when you feel you will have enough clothes to wash. He can either: 1) go to work with dirty clothes, 2) buy more clothes.", "NTA. Stop cleaning his work clothes and let him go dirty. Otherwise, he has to buy new clothes. Besides if you wash some clothes everyday it will certainly be ruined soon or later.", "NTA. You're very sweet to do the laundry. If he is completely in denial and you want to help (you're not obligated to but seem like the kind of nice person who would), see if you can order the shirt and pants he already has in a larger size? I'm sure if they are there he will wear them.... especially if you forgot about laundry day.", "NTA. You said you'd do laundry assuming normal laundry schedule, but daily is extraordinary. It wastes your time and it's inefficient using extra water, electricity and detergent compared to larger loads. Also, his shirt must be starting to wear out. He risks it suddenly tearing and then gr had nothing to wear. Eg 5 months x ,4 weeks x 5 washing days=  100 washes in 5 months instead of 20 washes.\n\nYou could be relaxing, exercising, or  \nstudying something extra to earn even more money in that time \n\nHe doesn't want to discuss it. Perhaps buy 4 identical shirts, wash them together, hang the spares somewhere hidden and give him 1 each day. Would be interesting to see if he notices you're not doing daily laundry.", "NTA. Remind him that the more his clothes get washed, the sooner they get worn out. Soon he won't have anything that fits him. Then take him shopping.\n\nIf it's because he has to try the clothes on, tell him that you can take them home to try on and return what doesn't fit. That's the beauty of brick and mortar stores.\n\nIf it is because he doesn't want to invest in the clothes because he's convinced that he's going to lose the weight, take him to the thrift stores. Go a couple of sizes bigger because you don't know if they were donated because they shrunk in the laundry.", "NTA - He can wash his own clothes like a grown adult if he's unwilling to be reasonable about it.", "Nta\n\nBust the zip on his trousers, then he'll have to go buy another pair. He can get some shirts while he's at it.", "NTA - if you wash those clothes every single day, they're not gonna last. The wear and tear of them being worn and washed daily, they might make it a few months before they shred off of his body and he has to buy new ones anyway. Tell him to buy a couple more outfits and that you'll do laundry 2-3 times a week.", "NTA.  When he comes home, take him clothes shopping.  If he won't do this by himself, do it together.  Either that or buy him clothing that he may or may not like.  Let him decide.", "NTA. It wastes a ton of water and electricity and is bad for the environment to run a full load for a single outfit. Only wash when you have a full load. He can deal with whatever needs to happen in the meantime.", "NTA, \n\nIf he isn\u2019t willing to buy more work clothes then I\u2019d personally make him responsible for washing his own work gear. I\u2019d see how long it lasts before he realises it isn\u2019t sustainable.", "NTA \nHaving one outfit for work is wild. Does this man know the meaning of the word hygiene?

Keep the receipts.", "NTA. \"Dress for the body you have, not the body you want.\"\n\nMaybe you can approach the guy with kindness, and suggest you'll take him clothes shopping for nice, cheap work clothes? It's pretty clear that he's struggling with the situation and a little out of touch.", "NTA, doing laundry daily is unsustainable for the environment, your bills as well as your own energy. Do resume your original frequency of doing laundry. He can hand-wash his one outfit if he so wishes. \n\nHis resistance to purchasing more clothes may be born from someplace deeper. Sounds like he does not accept his current weight, even though (most) weight fluctuations are a normal biological occurrence that could happen to anyone. A shopping trip plus a confidence-boosting pep talk combi could work. All the best.", "NTA and also wearing and washing the same pair of clothes every day is going to cause it to wear out faster and he will have to replace them sooner anyway.", "Well you agreed to do laundry- so tell him laundry day is Saturday (or whatever day), not every day and it\u2019s up to him on days that are not laundry day. there is a big difference between saying \u201cI\u2019ll do the laundry\u201d and I\u2019ll wash the same set of clothes for you every day. Those two are not the same thing and you clearly did not agree to that. He\u2019s a grown-up, treat him like one and he can figure it out.", "NTA\n\nDo the laundry once per week (or whatever your normal schedule is). This is his problem to solve, whether my washing this outfit himself, or buying new clothes. \n\nAnd as someone who *does not* fit into her own prepandemic work attire, I get why this is hard for him. But that doesn't mean you do daily laundry to soften the blow to his ego.", "NTA, but I think the practical thing I would do if I were you would be to buy him a couple more work items. You love this man, and he clearly feels bad about his weight gain. You have the opportunity to be a supportive partner by getting him a couple items and preventing him from having to be sad while shopping. He can face the reality of his weight gain some other time.", "NTA. Having only one outfit is insufficient for a professional wardrobe. At this point if he won't buy them, you buy them and take it out of your $800 in rent. Otherwise, just don't wash his clothes and he will have to buy more.", "NTA \n\nHe needs more than one just because something could happen to one.  He needs a backup.  And you shouldn't have to do laundry everyday.\n\nI understand his reluctance.  I'm the same way.  But buying clothes that fit and make him feel good will go a long way towards helping him be less self conscious about his weight.", "NTA\u2026..just go buy more, in the right size & be done with this\u2026..not the hill to die on\u2026. solve the problem, save your sanity\u2026", "NTA.  Just tell him that since he won\u2019t buy more stuff there are 2 choices. 1) you do laundry twice a week.  If he only has 1 set of clothes he will need to wash that outfit on your off days.  2) you buy him two more outfits and take the money from your portion of the rent. \n\nAnd tell him at the same time you will help with him losing weight if he wants you too.  Make sure that there are few snacks in the house and that you steer the groceries to healthy choices.  Idk if it is in the budget but places like hello fresh have low cal meals but even the non low call options are lower calorie already.", "NTA\nDo you have a joint account?\nJust get a few more sets in the same size as the one he has now. Bonus points for same brand and color. He might not even notice, ha!", "NAH if I\u2019m right but either way you\u2019re definitely not an AH. \n\nIt\u2019s a completely reasonable request but you might need to try a different approach. There\u2019s a chance the reason he isn\u2019t buying more clothes is because he\u2019s beating himself up about the weight gain. Buying more is accepting his shape the way it is and it sounds like he\u2019s fighting against that and might need emotional support with it. Maybe in not seeing weight gain as a \u201cpersonal failing\u201d but just something that everyone experiences at one point or another, maybe in understanding that he is allowed to have clothes that fit even if he does plan on trying to lose weight again. \n\nI\u2019ve been in his place, I spent a full 12 months wearing jeans every day because they were the only trousers that fit and I wouldn\u2019t buy more cause \u201cI was going to lose the weight\u201d. To the point I actually lost friends during that time because I had to cancel plans with friends on weekends regularly so I could wash them ready for work on Monday.\n\n10 years and a lot of therapy later and I can see now I was doing it as a way of punishing myself. I was so angry at myself for gaining weight because I saw it as a failing on my part that I wasn\u2019t \u201cthin enough\u201d and tied me whole self worth to it. I was miserable every single time I put on those jeans or I would sometimes have to force myself into clothes that were too small which was even worse.\n\nIt took a drunken conversation where I blurted out the truth and a forced trip to the shops as a result of it for me to allow myself to have clothes that made me feel good about how I looked. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have been able to show myself that kindness cause I believed that I deserved to feel bad about myself until I \u201cfixed things\u201d by loosing weight. \n\nI\u2019m not saying this is exactly what\u2019s going on for your partner, but it might be worth considering and making sure he knows that he deserves to feel good about himself regardless of what he weighs. I\u2019d also take a guess that a reassurance that you are attracted to him would probably be appreciated as well in whatever way you guys communicate that.\n\nHowever if it is just that he can\u2019t be bothered to go shopping and thinks it\u2019s not a problem because you always get it washed in time then I take it all back. He either buys more clothes or does his own laundry until he has more than one work outfit.", "NAH. I\u2019m kinda shocked a grown ass man wears the same outfit everyday. His coworkers probably think he\u2019s weird.", "He can't lose weight overnight. Eventually, he can fit into those clothes again, sure. But right now, he needs more. Maybe try a thrift store so he's not paying too much for \"temporary\" clothing.", "NTA\n\nDo laundry on a normal schedule. \n\nLet him know in advance that starting whichever day you will only be doing laundry every however often.

I do all my households laundry and I only do it once a week on Saturday or Sunday. Between then you can do it. \n\nI would tell him that your not telling him he needs to get rid of his old clothes however he needs a few more outfits to wear during the in between time while he loses the weight. Losing weight takes time. I would also mention to him that depending on the occupation wearing the same outfit every day can be seen as unprofessional.", "Quit washing his laundry. He will go shopping when he figures out what a pain daily laundry is. His coworkers must be talking about his 1 outfit by now. You might remind him of that.", "NTA. Maybe it would help if you bring up what clothes he will wear when there's a hole in one of the pieces of clothing. Sure, he could or could not lose weight, but there should always be a back-up, especially because of the laundry issue.", "Suggestion: next b-day/anniversary/etc. buy him some clothes as part of his gift. Make it a thing. That's what we do in my family. You never have to buy socks, underwear, pj's, etc because someone got some for you earlier in the year for Christmas or mother's day or your birthday, etc. Start small so he doesn't catch on to why you're doing it. Get him some t-shirts or something, next get him pants, and so on.", "NTA, though I doubt the real issue is the clothes for him. His ego is probably bruised by the weight gain and by not buying new clothes, he is refusing to accept his newfound weight. Which would be fine... If he were doing something about it.\n\nIf he won't go shopping or acknowledge the base issue, you can either stop doing his laundry or buy him new clothes.\n\nAs with most things, an open line of communication will get you the furthest. You don't want it to be about weight gain, but for him, it's about weight gain.", "NTA,  but my husband went through the same thing and didn't want to buy any new clothes. It took me some time to realize that he was uncomfortable in his one body and felt to insecure to go shopping and was afraid that fitting clothes would make him feel comfortable and therefore keep him from losing weight. I finally went and just bought him some clothes.  He was just so happy to have them and finally started to feel like himself again which on the other hand gave him the motivation to start working out again. I think sometimes when we are at a down point we just need some help and a small kick in the butt", "Buy him two more sets of the size that fits. A total of three means doing laundry on Wednesdays and on one weekend day.", "Doing laundry every day is going to cost more than buying a few more pairs of work clothes.\n\nNTA - give him a heads up that you will only be doing laundry on laundry day.", "NTA. Even if they appeared clean and neat everyday, I would notice if a coworker literally wore the same shirt every single day and think odd of that. So even if you loved doing laundry so much that you did it every single day of the week, he should still own more clothing anyway.", "Apart from the laundry issue, which is valid, I would worry that he is not presenting himself professionally by wearing the same outfit everyday.", "NTA. Washing the same outfit every day will make it wear out super-fast. It\u2019ll start looking unprofessional and if something gets a hole or rips, BF is screwed. \n\nHe needs to do some self-care and get stuff he feels comfortable in *now*, or the weight loss aspirations will be shame-based. And that\u2019s terrible motivation. \n\nIf he loses the weight quickly and has a bunch of work clothes that are now too big? Donate \u2018em or relegate them for dirty chores, go spelunking, whatever.", "NTA, but stop pushing him to buy more clothes. Just tell him that you can't keep doing laundry every day, so you're going to do laundry twice a week (or whatever) and any extra laundry that needs doing he needs to do himself.", "Hahahahahah I thought the same thing quite a few years back. came down to 1 pair of work clothes because I can't fit into my other ones.  What my wife said to me is that I should put the ones that are still nice away for now and get some clothes that fit properly. This way I was presentable during work.  It looks bad if buttons are stretched to their max and how are you going to explain why a button flew across the room during a meeting?  What will I do if the button on my pants breaks? I got 2 new pairs of pants and shirts for work. To this day I still don't fit in my old clothes but now I am working on fitting back into them.", "NTA. But this is about more than laundry, your partner is going through something if he has gained weight to the extent his clothes don\u2019t fit him. So maybe check in and ask how he is and if he is OK.

It sounds like he\u2019s a bit depressed.", "Hello everyone and thank you for the replies! A few things I want to clarify:\n\n1. We are not married and do not share finances (this is mutually agreed upon)\n\n2. I always offer to workout and cook meals with him and understand when he doesn\u2019t want to- I am not pushy about it, I just want him to be happy and healthy. \n\n3.

This started in the dark ages before we had a dryer, so doing laundry daily just wasn't an option.

But when interviewing for part time roles I needed a few office outfits I could fit into and had to accept buying some interim clothes, whilst I work towards looking after myself better. Buying clothes that fit felt like I was accepting I wouldn't loose weight, it felt like a failure and maybe that's what your husband is struggling with. Pick up a few shirts and trousers at the right size and put them in his wardrobe, keep on reassuring him you love him. Doing laundry every day is not reasonable, but he needs to come to the conclusion he's going to have to accept updating his wardrobe to his current size.

If, for instance, I offer to cook for everyone at home, and somebody wants to eat six or seven times a day, I cannot be expected to cook seven times.

Perhaps try thrift shopping for stuff in his current size, take the current clothes on his day off so you can reference. That way he\u2019s got more work clothes, you won\u2019t have to do laundry every day, and it didn\u2019t cost so much to buy new clothes. (Maybe he\u2019s frugal and doesn\u2019t see the point of dropping a lot of money on new clothes, when he thinks he\u2019s just going to lose the weight soon?) I would just put them in his clothes rotation and if he asks, explain that you had already said you\u2019re not doing laundry every single day anymore.

I haven't gotten rid of the others - hopefully this will be figured out and resolved.

He makes an effort to dress nice and buy clothes in the right size, even if he\u2019s not very fond of what that size is.

Thanks for the input and advice!", "Yeah I work in an office and if someone came in every day wearing the same thing I would probably assume they're going through hard times.

Yes, no human children. We have a cat, but she doesn\u2019t require much in the way of laundry haha.

New clothes or one day a week is needed as suggested by others.", "I\u2019m not sure I agree with that. You\u2019ve got to wash bedding, towels and blankets so that\u2019s 3 washes to start with. Even with only 2 people we can easily do 2-3 washes per week just on clothes once you factor in gym kit and DIY clothes. That means 5-6 washes a week as standard so I can easily see how someone would end up doing laundry almost every day if they didn\u2019t save some of it up for the weekend.\n\nI completely agree that OP shouldn\u2019t HAVE to do it every day and expecting them to wash a shirt each day to be reworn is crazy but just pushing back against the idea that doing laundry multiple times a week is out of the ordinary.", "If he goes to work every day surely he needs clean work clothes every day and if he only has one set of clothes... laundry every day. Hence another need for more work clothes XD.", "This is good advice. If my other approaches don\u2019t work, I may try this.", "This. Buy the bigger clothes and if/when he loses the weight bring them to a consignment shop.

Would be hard to find the same of what he already has I think, but I love the idea haha!", "He's a grown man... why does she have to do this for him? He needs to be responsible and buy himself clothes, rather than expecting OP to do laundry for him daily, or to be secretly going out and buying him clothes that look like his existing clothes, then stashing them somewhere so he doesn't realise he's not wearing the exact same thing over and over again.", "Thank you so much for the in-depth reply! I believe this is pretty much exactly how he feels. He\u2019s struggled with his weight before, and all I can do is be supportive because I can\u2019t really relate.

That way she would have known what was actually going on, she wouldn\u2019t have tried to support me losing weight when it was unhealthy and therefore accidentally enabled it, and we both might have realised earlier that I had a very warped body image for most of my life. \n\nHe might need time to prepare, you might need to agree rules or boundaries for times where emotions get high, but it could be worth starting from there.

It sounds like he's having a hard time accepting the weight gain is sticking around. Maybe push him into it and set up a shopping date at the mall for some clothes that fit. It helps to have someone there to help pick out outfits and tell him what looks good on him. Also having clothes that fit feels awesome.\n\nDoesn't he get self conscious from wearing the same thing every day to work? I'm not putting anyone down for wearing the same thing a few times a week but I'd definitely worry about the perception my coworkers would have of me.

If he refuses to buy more, then he's stuck in incredibly uncomfortable clothes, which act as a reminder not to eat as much. It's a form of mental gymnastics to deny the weight gain is an issue. It's a pain for you, but I think you should just let him alone to deal with it on his own.\n\nIf it were me, I would say \"This isn't about your weight, it's about me doing laundry. I'm willing to wash maybe 2x per week, but I'm not going to do laundry every day.

Unless something is really out of whack, on a $70k annual salary, you should still be taking home at least $4k a month after taxes, health insurance, 401k contributions, etc.  You are paying $800 a month in rent.  Figure another $300 for your share of groceries, maybe $250 for utilities, $200 for gas, $400 for car payment, $150 for car insurance, and $80 for cell.  These are all higher numbers than I pay for these things, so I don\u2019t think they are unreasonable.  This comes to $2,080 and leaves you with almost $2k a month for whatever.
