By the time I was finished it was very late and everyone already left the party and everything seemed to be going OK.\n\nTwo days after the party, my sister called me, upset, asking me what things I put in my curry. As it turned out, my BIL\u2019s brother Tim stopped by toward the end of the party. He hadn\u2019t eaten so my sister and BIL invited him in for a bite. Tim had my curry and said he liked it so much that my sister packed him some to take back home. Then his girlfriend (not living together but has a key to his place) went through his fridge, heated some curry for herself, and unknowingly fed the curry to her dog, resulting in vomiting. They took the dog to the vet and the dog is fine now.\n\nWhen my sister learned that I put chocolate in my curry, she said I should have let her know such a fact. I told her everyone at the party could have chocolate just fine, and anybody with allergies or planning to feed a pet needed to check for ingredients in unknown food before eating/feeding their pet said food.

The dog probably vomited from the curry itself, there\u2019s probably not enough chocolate in there to make a dog that sick.", "NTA there was probably onion and garlic and other things dogs can't eat.\n\nWhat a waste of curry it sounds great", "NTA the dog shouldn't have been fed the curry anyway as it's not good for them. Also the amount of chocolate the dog ended up eating is likely not enough to poison a dog (depending on the size of the dog and the dog's own tolerance) so I imagine the curry regardless of chocolate content had a fair amount to do with the vomiting. Even if curry was fine for dogs to eat, what person feeds their dog cooked food from an unknown source? You have no idea what could be in it and dogs can get sick from a variety of human safe foods. It's just irresponsible on the dog owners part and has nothing to do with you or how you prepare your curry.", "Who the hell gives their dog curry!", "Not only curry. Dogs should not be given any human food. It has way too much salt.\n\nAnd I think curry would have onions and garlic, even if it did not have chocolate. Onions and garlic are straight up poison to dogs and cats. What an irresponsible dog owner.\n\nAnd to blame OP for her secret ingredient when other obvious ingredients were just as, if not more, dangerous.", "Exactly! I know dogs shouldn\u2019t even have paprika because of how it effects them!", "Plus so many spiced food include garlic, which is highly toxic to digs", "Spices, garlic and onions generally go in a curry. The girlfriend is a fool for feeding that to her dog. Its not the chocolate its feeding a dog a curry that's the issues.\n\nNTA op that girlfriend is", "Exactly this. Why would you give a dog curry?!? Just the spices alone would make them unwell. I have never heard of anyone doing this and as a dog owner, I find it concerning. Hopefully the gf learned something about thinking of unknown ingredients in what she casually gives her dog.

Even for a minute.", "Dogs shouldn\u2019t have a whole bunch of different spices (garlic is definitely bad for them for example.).  The girlfriend in this example is mistreating her dog.", "exactly. it wasnt the chocolate, it was the spices. chocolate in curry isnt new, and ive never seen someone put enough in it to poison a dog.", "Curries usually also contain lots of onion and garlic which is bad for dogs, so even if it had no chocolate, it would still have been unsafe for the dog", "My first thought was... Who would feed a dog curry?!?", "Someone taking food i lovingly prepared for them and feeding a dog with it would never get any food from me again. NTA", "Curries typically have onions too which is a BIG no for dogs. It lowers their white blood cell counts", "My dog is spoiled as hell and gets human food often\u2026.I wouldn\u2019t dream of giving him ANY curry! That\u2019s an absurd thing to feed a dog.", "Yes because onions - at the very least. Very poisonous to dogs.", "'He liked it so much.' It was not a doggy bag meant for a dog..... NTA OP. Wow this is soooooo silly!", "Exactly my thought!", "Honesty, any food that\u2019s seasoned I assume isn\u2019t safe for my dog\u2026because the vast majority of seasoning has onion or garlic or both in it.", "My first thought.

Who should know better than to feed her dog something like curry because it\u2019s just common sense.", "I should read before I post. I just posted the exact same comment.", "Right? I would never in a million years think to tell someone about ingredients in a curry for concern it may be fed to a dog.", "Couldn't have worded it better.\n\nNTA\n\nYou were feeding people at the party, not someone's drop ins GFS dog....", "Not only chocolate, but garlic or onions in the curry are dangerous too! Seriously, the girlfriend is going to get the dog killed if she keeps randomly feeding it.", "My thought exactly", "Right. My guess is it wasn\u2019t even the chocolate that made the dog sick - depending on the size of the dog, it can take a pretty large amount of chocolate to induce vomiting. I\u2019m assuming the amount of chocolate was negligible compared to other spices and ingredients.\n\nNTA.", "Yeah, apart from the chocolate alone the spicyness is probably everything but healthy for a dog.", "Not sure how you make curry either, but garlic and onions are also bad for dogs.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
