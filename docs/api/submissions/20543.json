Tim had my curry and said he liked it so much that my sister packed him some to take back home. Then his girlfriend (not living together but has a key to his place) went through his fridge, heated some curry for herself, and unknowingly fed the curry to her dog, resulting in vomiting. They took the dog to the vet and the dog is fine now.\n\nWhen my sister learned that I put chocolate in my curry, she said I should have let her know such a fact. I told her everyone at the party could have chocolate just fine, and anybody with allergies or planning to feed a pet needed to check for ingredients in unknown food before eating/feeding their pet said food.

A small tidbit of unsauced chicken thigh or peice of potato. \n\nI think by \"human food\" they mean \"fully cooked & seasoned dishes\" - obviously giving a dog a piece of deboned chicken won't harm it (because many breeds of dog eat chickens and other small animals raw), but giving your dog a piece of boneless garlic chicken can make it sick.\n\nIt's the cooking and adding additional seasonings that is dangerous for other animals because most others don't eat the plants that we use for seasoning. Also, it's been found that [cooking food destroys the DNA in it](https://news.stanford.edu/2023/06/12/study-mice-links-heat-damaged-dna-food-possible-genetic-risks/), which in turn causes adverse reactions in other animals who eat it.

After that, while I don't actively give dogs chocolate, I don't lose my mind over it if one gets into a dove bar or steals someone's smore by a campfire.
