Stop telling her ANYTHING. She doesn\u2019t even need to know who your vendors are at this point. Make sure the vendors all have passwords and know the situation in case she tries to call and meddle again. You\u2019re going to have to start getting harsh with her. \n\nLet her cry and pout. Let her daughter get pissy. Who gives a fuck? She\u2019s being psychotic.", "**NTA**\n\nYou've been much too gentle and accommodating.   Start with the seamstress.   Tell her that you'll not be wearing anything that you did not request.   Do not worry about money that someone else threw away.   Then tell her and her daughter to butt out.  \n\nYou and your partner really need to work on how to set boundaries.   A good start would be for the two of you to read Anne Katherine's two books about boundaries.   The first explains what they are and why they are important to us as individuals.   The second, *Where to Draw the Line*, helps you do just that.\nBe firm with both you", "You might as well give her the dress and the flowers and tell her 'there you go , go marry your son'", "NTA cut all contact with that phycho", "NTA!! Wow!! Sounds like your mil is my mil\u2019s sister. On our wedding day she went behind our backs and had a second florist come in and change out our pew bows that were just white and greenery for big blobs of plastic flowers that were not even in our color scheme. Thankfully, the pastor\u2019s wife knew of my mother-in-law\u2019s scheming history. I strongly suggest as you set up your vendors that you have passwords so that your mother-in-law can\u2019t go behind and change anything. Mine even try to change the cake from chocolate and white to carrot cake.\nBack when I got married, there wasn\u2019t a term of red flags. But you obviously are seeing red flags now prior to your wedding. Thankfully your other half has your back because I promise you this is nothing compared to what it\u2019s going to be like when you have kids. When you have kids you need to have passwords and boundaries with the school so that your mother-in-law doesn\u2019t come in and try and take the kids. Oh I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll say that they need a break or they need to have an ice cream afternoon with Grammy, but still trying to take them out of school without your permission is going to be a nightmare.  stick to your boundaries what else can happen, she get pissed at you and go no contact? Wow like that would really hurt your feelings. Lol!!", "NTA. That lady needs to find a new hobby.", "NTA and I\u2019m really proud of you for continuing to set  boundaries. I\u2019m a therapist myself and I know how challenging it is to learn to assert yourself. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing though - *setting* boundaries is only part of the equation. The other part is enforcing those boundaries via consequences. When we teach children about boundaries, we enforce them by saying \u201cif you do X, then Y will happen\u201d. In other words, there needs to be consequences for disregarding boundaries, otherwise boundaries *cannot* work. It doesn\u2019t sound like consequences have been established or enacted on MIL, so I think you and your partner need to discuss what steps you will take when she crosses your boundaries again (because she most likely will). Make sure that you are willing and able to go through with the consequences and communicate them to MIL. Then, the next time she crosses a boundary, tell her something like: \u201cwe asked you not to do X, otherwise we would enforce consequence Y. You have chosen to do X, so Y will now be enacted\u201c. Keep doing that, again and again. Either she will choose to respect your boundaries or not - but that will be her choice and don\u2019t let her sulking convince you otherwise. \n\nYou got this! Congrats on the wedding :)", "NTA. Your day your choice. Invest in a good pair of ear buds and tune her suggestions out. Give your wedding vendors a code so she can't add or change something. Just in case.", "NTA, but you both need to work HARD on your boundaries from now on, unfortunally probably you'll have to use rudeness sometimes, endure and/or ignore the cries, the sulk everything, stop telling her stuff so she understands that this is your life not hers, because if you don't you're probably right OP, it is going to get worst. What she is doing is a kind of abuse, isn't it? So, it will get worse especially with kids envolved, she's already a mother.. wanna bet  she \"will always knows best?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck, OP. Hope your wedding goes according YOUR wishes!", "NTA\n\nI only ncluded my MIL in the bridal shower and day of wedding. \n\n\nCut. Her. Out. Stop telling her anything. Her opinions don't even matter. If she calls, don't answer. If she texts, gray-rock her, if you see her in person, learn how to put her in her place. \n\nCall all of your vendors and PW protect your choices/decisions.

(She has since passed) She overstepped more boundaries than a little, and I'm not the type that's backward in going forward! Honestly I came home fro. Work a few times and she was doing my garden.
