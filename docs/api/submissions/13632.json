Tell her that you'll not be wearing anything that you did not request.   Do not worry about money that someone else threw away.   Then tell her and her daughter to butt out.  \n\nYou and your partner really need to work on how to set boundaries.   A good start would be for the two of you to read Anne Katherine's two books about boundaries.   The first explains what they are and why they are important to us as individuals.

Wow!! Sounds like your mil is my mil\u2019s sister.

Thankfully, the pastor\u2019s wife knew of my mother-in-law\u2019s scheming history. I strongly suggest as you set up your vendors that you have passwords so that your mother-in-law can\u2019t go behind and change anything.

I\u2019m a therapist myself and I know how challenging it is to learn to assert yourself. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing though - *setting* boundaries is only part of the equation. The other part is enforcing those boundaries via consequences. When we teach children about boundaries, we enforce them by saying \u201cif you do X, then Y will happen\u201d. In other words, there needs to be consequences for disregarding boundaries, otherwise boundaries *cannot* work. It doesn\u2019t sound like consequences have been established or enacted on MIL, so I think you and your partner need to discuss what steps you will take when she crosses your boundaries again (because she most likely will). Make sure that you are willing and able to go through with the consequences and communicate them to MIL. Then, the next time she crosses a boundary, tell her something like: \u201cwe asked you not to do X, otherwise we would enforce consequence Y. You have chosen to do X, so Y will now be enacted\u201c. Keep doing that, again and again. Either she will choose to respect your boundaries or not - but that will be her choice and don\u2019t let her sulking convince you otherwise. \n\nYou got this!

From the least harmful MIL to the most harmful MIL, almost every one causes some kind of issue.\n\nMILs can change things because they think they know better and her son's/DILS opinions don't matter. You need to set up the password protection and tell MIL that you want 0 help beyond what you ask of her. Otherwise, she'll keep on doing what she wants.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like he has your back if she still doing her crap\u2026 tell her the next thing she does something unasked for - she is disinvited. Maybe that will work.", "Reminds me of that classic post about the MIL and the wedding cake.", "Edit- uninvited", "Fwiw, I think most people don\u2019t react well to explicit \u201cconsequences\u201d. Instead, be explicit about what the natural consequence is (easier too). So \u201cMom, when you do that, we ended up resenting you and wanting you less involved.\u201d \u201cWhen you cry when I tell you No, I end up wanting just to avoid telling you when you\u2019re doigg no something I don\u2019t like and just avoiding you instead.\u201d  Also be sure to tell them what the _positive_ consequence of doing what you want them to do would be. If you would stop doing XYZ, we\u2019d actually be more likely to want to include you.", "You're not being rude. She is being rude and you are responding firmly. Being firm isn't being rude. Just keep reminding yourself that. She started it you're just ending it.  And tell her that too when she sulks and pouts. She can plan her own wedding if she wants to have that much say but this is your and husband's day not hers.", "Enforcing boundaries is not intrinsically rude.\n\nI mean, I don't know exactly what you've said, but you really don't seem like a rude person. Just new to setting and enforcing boundaries.\n\nIt will help you commit to this much healthier level of contact if you get yourself out of that mindset.\n\nBe kind to you.\n\nETA NTA", "Congratulations on your wedding and good luck. You need to learn how to \"grey rock\" and read books on dealing with narcissists.", "I think this is a really emotionally intelligent reply to a somewhat smart but also harsh comment. Think of your personal boundaries as fences; if you build a fence made of cloth around your yard, it won't last long. If you build it out of rocks, it'll last a long time. \n\nIt's time to change your entire mindset; you are trying to be nice but that doesn't work, clearly. She keeps running over your boundaries. You are now entitled to cut her off or be harsh until she learns to listen. Oh, and feel free to block your SIL indefinitely. She is not entitled to your time because your MIL cannot behave like an adult. \n\nFinally, I would like to recommend you consider moving somewhere far away from interfering family members. When family members don't know what is happening in your life and can't drive across town to see you, it is so much easier. It will also make having kids easier because MIL won't show up at the hospital demanding to be in the delivery room. Best wishes to you and your partner.", "This!", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I think ********* is better"]}
