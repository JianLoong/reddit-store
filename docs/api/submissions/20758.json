{"id": 20758, "submission_id": "14koae0", "title": "WIBTA if I did not attend my friend's party because of her twin sister?", "selftext": "(Note: Legal age of drinking is 18 here)\nI (19f) have a friend 'Jess' (about to be 19f) who is having a birthday party this coming weekend. I would consider her one of my very best friends. I've known her for six years, but as a result I have also known her twin sister 'Maddison' (same age) for just as long. \n\nMaddison and I don't get along. She is in the habit of messing with me and ignoring my social and physical boundaries because I'm 'fun to rile up'. For the most part I just do my best to ignore her, and I can tolerate it on a normal day.\n\nThat being said, Maddison becomes a hundred times worse the minute she has had anything to drink. I have only been at two events with her and alcohol. Both were sleepovers at her and Jess's house and both were hell. \n\nThe first one was Jess's 18th. Maddison got incredibly drunk and followed me around all night, poking and jabbing at me 'playfully', and talking very loudly over me any time I tried to speak. I talked to Jess about it and she said it wouldn't happen again.\n\nDespite that, the second party was even worse. Maddison poured half a glass of Sprite over my white shirt (which made it see-through) 'accidentally' then proceeded to make a number of gross comments about my body which I'll leave out to keep this pg-13. When I asked her to leave me alone she just doubled down with the creepy talk and in the end I had to lock myself in a bathroom and call my mum to pick me up at 2am because I was so uncomfortable.\n\nTo the surprise of no one, Jess is having another sleepover for her birthday, there will be drink, and Maddison will be there. I told Jess outright that I wasn't going to come because of Maddison. Jess said she'd make sure that I wasn't bothered again but since I expressed the same issues with her before and it didn't stop Maddison last time, I was adamant with my decision. Jess said she was sad but understood why I wasn't coming.\n\nA few hours ago, a mutual friend contacted me and called me an asshole, saying that Jess was crying on the phone about how I wouldn't be there for her special day. A few of my other friends shared her sentiment and told me I was overly sensitive, saying I was trying to make someone else's birthday all about me.\n\nSo WIBTA if I still refused to go, knowing how upset it's made Jess?\n\nedit: misspelt 'rile' as 'file'", "created_utc": 1687897179, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14koae0/wibta_if_i_did_not_attend_my_friends_party/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No clue, other than that I'm apparently an easy teasing target", "Bear spray and tasers are most definitely illegal here, but even if they were I wouldn't really want to make her cry. The rubber snake is a good idea though", "I found it funny. \n\n\nMost twins I've known are super close and share most things especially birthdays and often friend groups, which often seems to result in jealous behaviour if one twin suddenly gets a \"best\" friend.

Why do you want to upset me? Do I threatened you in some way? Are you jealous of my friendship with jess? Do you wish we were better friends? Do you fancy me?

Sounds like Maddison has a crush on you.", "NTA and I\u2019d try communicating your feelings to your friend privately. Check out the DEAR MAN letter writing model. It\u2019s basically just a guide for laying out the issue clearly and calmly. If her twin is this shitty, I would bet your friend has just become numb to the same wretched treatment over the years.", "Nta and I\u2019m sure you probably clocked this but Maddison has a crush on you and is a fucking weirdo about it", "NTA and why are they doing sleepovers? That\u2019s very childish, but anyway, if Jess truly understood, she would\u2019ve made Maddison stop the minute you were uncomfortable. Also why is she crying to everyone else but you.

Don't go and your friend will see that her twin sister's behavior has consequences.", "Purely coming at this from a rules lawyer/curiosity perspective: Don't you think this violates sub rule #5? I've seen AITA commenters refer to a mild raising of ones voice as falling into this category.\n\nPartly asking because I don't think the \"mild annoyance\" of a water gun is the sort of thing that deters this type of person. IMO she at best needs put on the spot, loudly, and shamed in front of her friends and family, and you'll be lucky if that has any impact.
