{"id": 20758, "submission_id": "14koae0", "title": "WIBTA if I did not attend my friend's party because of her twin sister?", "selftext": "(Note: Legal age of drinking is 18 here)\nI (19f) have a friend 'Jess' (about to be 19f) who is having a birthday party this coming weekend. I would consider her one of my very best friends. I've known her for six years, but as a result I have also known her twin sister 'Maddison' (same age) for just as long. \n\nMaddison and I don't get along. She is in the habit of messing with me and ignoring my social and physical boundaries because I'm 'fun to rile up'. For the most part I just do my best to ignore her, and I can tolerate it on a normal day.\n\nThat being said, Maddison becomes a hundred times worse the minute she has had anything to drink. I have only been at two events with her and alcohol. Both were sleepovers at her and Jess's house and both were hell. \n\nThe first one was Jess's 18th. Maddison got incredibly drunk and followed me around all night, poking and jabbing at me 'playfully', and talking very loudly over me any time I tried to speak. I talked to Jess about it and she said it wouldn't happen again.\n\nDespite that, the second party was even worse. Maddison poured half a glass of Sprite over my white shirt (which made it see-through) 'accidentally' then proceeded to make a number of gross comments about my body which I'll leave out to keep this pg-13. When I asked her to leave me alone she just doubled down with the creepy talk and in the end I had to lock myself in a bathroom and call my mum to pick me up at 2am because I was so uncomfortable.\n\nTo the surprise of no one, Jess is having another sleepover for her birthday, there will be drink, and Maddison will be there. I told Jess outright that I wasn't going to come because of Maddison. Jess said she'd make sure that I wasn't bothered again but since I expressed the same issues with her before and it didn't stop Maddison last time, I was adamant with my decision. Jess said she was sad but understood why I wasn't coming.\n\nA few hours ago, a mutual friend contacted me and called me an asshole, saying that Jess was crying on the phone about how I wouldn't be there for her special day. A few of my other friends shared her sentiment and told me I was overly sensitive, saying I was trying to make someone else's birthday all about me.\n\nSo WIBTA if I still refused to go, knowing how upset it's made Jess?\n\nedit: misspelt 'rile' as 'file'", "created_utc": 1687897179, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14koae0/wibta_if_i_did_not_attend_my_friends_party/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good for you in standing up for yourself.", "NTA - You\u2019ve set boundaries that have repeatedly been crossed.

Are you sure Maddison doesn\u2019t have a crush on you?", "Is it wrong that this idea actually made me laugh? I mean, you're not potty-training a puppy or teaching a kitten not to scratch the furniture, but that seems like a very amusing way to get someone to stop bullying you.\n\n~~Also, why is Jess not defending you? I get that Maddison is her sister, but seriously!~~", "Plus maybe a warning that Maddison would lose a hand if she tries poking OP again.", "I definitely don't have the room to host our entire friendgroup of eleven girls at my house for a sleepover, unfortunately", "To be honest I just put the same age thing because I thought it would be funny lol\n\nBoth of them turn 19 this Friday, and as long as I've known them they've always had separate parties but attended each other's because they're family.

The rubber snake is a good idea though", "I found it funny. \n\n\nMost twins I've known are super close and share most things especially birthdays and often friend groups, which often seems to result in jealous behaviour if one twin suddenly gets a \"best\" friend.

Does Jess try to help the situation at all?", "She is cunning in that she will never do anything overtly mean to me directly in front of Jess, but some of my other friends definitely have been witness to it. Usually though no one will intervene unless I appear visibly upset, at which point she'll stop badgering me temporarily then start again maybe twenty minutes later", "Have you ever just attempted calling her out .... the moment she starts picking on you just ask... why don't you like me? Why do you want to upset me? Do I threatened you in some way? Are you jealous of my friendship with jess? Do you wish we were better friends? Do you fancy me? Or are you just a mean person????", "And think about if Jess is worth you setting these boundaries, especially when no one has your back. It\u2019s a lot of work to get someone like this to back off", "I'll be honest and say I'm pretty bad with direct confrontation, but on the rare occasions I do stand up to her she makes it out like I'm being overdramatic and then I just feel embarrassed, so I've gotten into the habit of just trying to avoid or ignore her whenever possible,  hence me not wanting to go to the party"]}
