He is but this girl is a party girl while my friend is... less party oriented. She's constantly talking about the dudes she's having \"fun\" with while at the same time lamenting that she can't get a guy to marry. She acknowledges that the guys she's having fun with are not marriage material.\n\nShe's had some dates with guys that are apparently looking for a serious relationship and she's a completely different person with them, she pretends to be a home girl and straight up lies about having ONS pretty frequently.\n\nSo my friend group was out when we suddenly bumped into her and just said hi, did some small talk and introduced her to my group of 4 and then went on our separate ways. Later at work, she asked me about John (not real name) if he was single and if I could hook them up. I told her that he wasn't single and she starts asking about their relationship, how long it's been, is it solid, etc. I told her I don't have many details as we don't hang out that frequently (another lie) and I deflect by telling her that I had to go.\n\nNow I'm worried that the lie is going to eventually blow up on me but I feel that she's a horrible match for John. I have no doubt that she'd be able to weasle into his life if given the chance as she's pretty attractive.\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for lying to my coworker about my friend?", "created_utc": 1681702196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12p0bji/aita_for_lying_to_a_coworker_that_a_friend_of/", "score": 889, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I personally don't like to mix my work and personal life. Little to gain, much to strain.\n\nYou can't truly know if your coworker would be a good match for your friend, but you probably should discuss it with him to get his thoughts as for the most part it really isn't your duty or anything to prevent a romantic kindling. On the flip side you have no obligation to set them up either. You're not getting in the way of anything because there isn't anything there right now.\n\nFinally, your coworker sounds like a manipulator. On top of all the other info you gave us, you tell her he's in a relationship and that should have been the end of it. Wrong.

Therefore, I find your lie acceptable. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re a very good liar though! Work on that. Just keep it simple with her.

If this coworker has honest intentions, even if her intentions are just a hookup as long as she\u2019s being honest, she won\u2019t mind you making him aware of her interest, if she\u2019s not honourable then she\u2019ll want you to keep her asking secret or lie about her intentions.
