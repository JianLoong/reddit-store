He is but this girl is a party girl while my friend is... less party oriented. She's constantly talking about the dudes she's having \"fun\" with while at the same time lamenting that she can't get a guy to marry. She acknowledges that the guys she's having fun with are not marriage material.\n\nShe's had some dates with guys that are apparently looking for a serious relationship and she's a completely different person with them, she pretends to be a home girl and straight up lies about having ONS pretty frequently.\n\nSo my friend group was out when we suddenly bumped into her and just said hi, did some small talk and introduced her to my group of 4 and then went on our separate ways. Later at work, she asked me about John (not real name) if he was single and if I could hook them up. I told her that he wasn't single and she starts asking about their relationship, how long it's been, is it solid, etc. I told her I don't have many details as we don't hang out that frequently (another lie) and I deflect by telling her that I had to go.\n\nNow I'm worried that the lie is going to eventually blow up on me but I feel that she's a horrible match for John. I have no doubt that she'd be able to weasle into his life if given the chance as she's pretty attractive.\n\nSo, Am I The Asshole for lying to my coworker about my friend?", "created_utc": 1681702196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12p0bji/aita_for_lying_to_a_coworker_that_a_friend_of/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You know your friend pretty well and know that this girl isn't going to be good for him in the long run. I think you're a good friend for doing that, but it would be good as well to tell him the truth if you think he can handle \"resisting\" her lool.", "NTA, but next time just be straight with her and say you don\u2019t want to mix work and relationships. Don\u2019t shit where you eat and all that.", "NTA\nYou told her he\u2019s in a relationship and she immediately asks how solid it is. Even tho you lied she did tell you something about her boundaries for relationships.", "NTA\n\nMaybe people will think I'm crazy but here's my logic. \n\nFor starters, you have friends and coworkers, and it's probably super beneficial to keep those things separated, or at least many would feel that way. I personally don't like to mix my work and personal life. Little to gain, much to strain.\n\nYou can't truly know if your coworker would be a good match for your friend, but you probably should discuss it with him to get his thoughts as for the most part it really isn't your duty or anything to prevent a romantic kindling. On the flip side you have no obligation to set them up either. You're not getting in the way of anything because there isn't anything there right now.\n\nFinally, your coworker sounds like a manipulator. On top of all the other info you gave us, you tell her he's in a relationship and that should have been the end of it. Wrong. She starts trying to get details that might lead to him ending his current relationship in favor of being with her. I cant speak for everyone else but that rubs me the wrong way.\n\nIf I thought I was protecting a friend by doing what you are doing then I think that's probably fair.", "I'm going with NTA. Lying is bad Op next time she asked just tell her you'd rather not say about someone else's relationship. \n\nI know you're just looking out for your friend and it is true that you have no right to interfere on judge who your friends decided to be with but you should not play in any part of a relationshi that you know is potentially leaning on the negative toxic ones. \n\nWe all have intuitions and judgement that sometimes we have to evaluate and follow because it's there for a reason. \n\nJust don't lie and find ways not to tell the truth either. Or just straight out tell her that you don't want to play matchmaker. \n\nGood friends look out for each other,  it's one of the fundamental things for a friendship", "Nta.

Because it\u2019s work, however, I\u2019d recommend against telling her that you\u2019re not comfortable fixing her up with your friend. You don\u2019t need static from her. Therefore, I find your lie acceptable. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re a very good liar though! Work on that. Just keep it simple with her. He is in a serious relationship and has been for years. If she presses you for details?

I will ask them about your questions and if they\u2019d like me to answer you.\u201d Sometimes if I think it\u2019s necessary I\u2019ll add in \u201cis there anything you\u2019d specifically like me to tell them about you?\u201d\n\nIt truthfully applies to most people (nobody likes being gossiped about) and brings the whole situation aboveboard. If this coworker has honest intentions, even if her intentions are just a hookup as long as she\u2019s being honest, she won\u2019t mind you making him aware of her interest, if she\u2019s not honourable then she\u2019ll want you to keep her asking secret or lie about her intentions. From there you can decide who you wish to be loyal to and who you can tell to go to go fly a kite.\n\nYour friend will also respect that you\u2019ve given him the information and let him decide for himself.\n\nSo tell your coworker that you\u2019re going to be speaking to this friend soon and bring it all aboveboard.

If you like a person, you are going to be interested in their life and be happy for them if it's good.", "Just because you're open to the possibility of someone breaking up with their girlfriend doesn't mean you'd actively facilitate it. Maybe the relationship is on the rocks and they're going to break up soon anyway, and she wants to be ready just in case, but she wouldn't want to ruin the relationship if it were stable.\n\nOr maybe she was just disappointed to hear her crush was already taken and she was just curious what sort of girl he liked. If someone I was interested in was already taken, I might dejectedly ask for details about the relationship out of disappointment, not because I'm actively trying to break it up."]}
