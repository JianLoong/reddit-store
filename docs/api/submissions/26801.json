{"id": 26801, "submission_id": "16hxxht", "title": "AITA for not going to my sister's wedding?", "selftext": "I (31 M) have been married to my wonderful wife (33 F) for a year. My sister (33 F) is getting married October 1st. I'm happy for her, but I'm not attending the wedding. \n\nSister is one of the angriest people I've ever met. Mom brushes it off because Sister's a tiny blonde who weighs 105 lbs soaking wet, but she has rages that can last for days. If you do something she disapproves of, she'll scream and sob and break things. It's been this way our whole lives, and she's never once faced consequences or admitted to wrong-doing.\n\nWell, if you can\u2019t guess from the fact that I'm posting here, I did something she didn't like, and her response led me to block her on everything. If I'm the asshole for doing this, I'm ready to accept my judgment. But I think I made the right decision.\n\nI'm the only boy in my family. When I married Wife, I took her last name. I did it for practical reasons: my last name was hard to pronounce/spell, and hers is a word. Think \"Jessica Rabbit\" or \"Grace Slick.\" That's my wife. She never has to spell it out or help pronounce it, and ever since I took her name, I've been significantly happier. I work on a construction site, and even the meat-heads there said, \"Wow, that's much easier. Good call.\"\n\nSister--who didn't attend my wedding, ftr--was absolutely furious when I told her. Screamed at me, called my wife an \"emasculating abusive bitch,\" said she was going to start calling me \"Mrs.\", and that Wife's not invited to the wedding. I said if Wife isn't invited then I'm not invited--we're a package deal. Sister told us both to fuck off, and I thought that was the end of it. We didn't speak for months, but then a wedding invitation arrived in the mail. \n\nIt was addressed to me. Just me, using my old name. No acknowledgment of my new name or my wife. I swear, if Sister had simply addressed the invitation to \"Mr. and Mrs. New Name,\" I would've taken it as a sign that she felt remorse. Wife agrees that the gesture would have gone a long way. But instead Sister decided to toss in what felt like a final petty dig.\n\nI told Sister we would only attend if she apologized for calling my wife a bitch. She refused, accused us of giving her an ultimatum, and said we were \"punishing her for having an opinion.\" I no longer care that it's my sister's wedding--I refuse to subject my wife to what will surely be an abusive trainwreck. Now that the wedding is only a few weeks away, my family's been hounding me nonstop. They don't understand how I could miss my sister's big day, and they think she can't be held accountable for her actions because planning a wedding is stressful.

The family lineage was going to end one way or another.\n* Husband sounds very resolute in the post, but we went back and forth on this for weeks. Sister involved his mom, and Mom begged him not to make her go alone. He was going to do it for her, but then Mom asked him if he really wanted to go, and he couldn't lie.

You could delete all of your post except the question, and that would still be true. Your sister's wedding is about her and her marriage, full stop. As a wedding guest, you're simply an interested bystander. If you don't wish to attend, for ANY reason, then that's just all there is to it. If your sister doesn't like your decision, that's a her problem, not a you problem. Several people who I wanted at my wedding declined to attend, and I was sad they weren't there, but that's just the way life goes.\n\nSame goes for your surname, really. It's YOUR name, and you can change it to whatever you want, whenever you want. No need to explain or justify it to anybody. Doesn't matter if she takes your name, or you take hers, if you both want to hyphenate, if nobody changes, if you want to choose a new shared last name... you aren't ever obligated to explain. You two could decide you want to be known as Mr. and Mrs. GroundBeef, and you don't have to explain it to anyone other than the judge who signs off on it.\n\nAs an aside, it sounds like your sister might feel that, in order to feel like a special and important bride, she needs lots of people fawning over her all day, or something. I concede that it's probably harder to feel like \"queen for a day\" with fewer attendees, but managing your sister's feelings is still not your job.\n\nEdited because I forgot that composing in my notes app and doing copy/paste would turn my paragraphs into the dreaded wall of text", "Wow , what the hell is wrong with the rest of your family by enabling her.", "NTA- I would have sent it returned to sender, no one here at with that name.", "NTA  \n\n\nyou told her the boundary and she crossed it thus telling you, non verbaly that she does not want you at the wedding, and she doubled down on this by using the wrong name.  \n\n\ndo no go let her finally have consequences for her behavior", "very obvious nta", "NTA\u2014 you weren\u2019t invited, why would you go?

My sister (33 F) is getting married October 1st. I'm happy for her, but I'm not attending the wedding. \n\nSister is one of the angriest people I've ever met.

I did it for practical reasons: my last name was hard to pronounce/spell, and hers is a word. Think \"Jessica Rabbit\" or \"Grace Slick.\" That's my wife.

(No 'surprise' she's here!; no asking you to do anything for her; no explaining away anything about her.) But that if they cannot do that, then you will limit them in your life, too. That is such a hard thing to think or say, much less do; but your family is not a healthy family. You need to get better at protecting yourself and your wife (and your future kids). That means cutting out the toxic people.\n\nI'm sorry about your family. You are doing the right thing!", "NTA avoid anyone that's calling and texting u....\nSister didn't  attend your wedding no reason for u to attend hers especially since she doesn't respect you or your wife...", "NTA...sorry your sister is so evil. Best thing is to go no contact and enjoy the quiet. Instead of going to the wedding go for a great weekend getaway.", "NTA Send her your regrets and a bottle of CBD with a note telling her to chill.", "NTAH\n\nYour sister is psycho. Why she hasn't been dumped by her fiance is a mystery. I just hope to Christ they don't have children because I guarantee she will be horrifically abusive. Maybe not physically, but definitely emotionally.", "NTA. But the problem here is that your family are enablers. Block everyone and unblock them when the wedding comes. And please cut your sister off.", "Why would she care if you change your last name. Does it affect her in any way?", "To all the people saying \u201cHow could you miss your sister\u2019s wedding?\u201d Remind them about how she missed yours!", "NTA - the audacity of your sister to think she has any say in what you do. If she likes the family name so much she can keep it and pass it along, no one is stopping her except her outdated way of thinking. \n\nI LOLed at the invitation - she thinks she\u2019s smooth. Don\u2019t give her the satisfaction of interacting further. Her play was probably to be something like I sent him an invitation and he\u2019s still mad at me! Honestly, I\u2019d stamp it \u201creturn to sender -  no one with that name at this address\u201d and call it a day in this one.", "NTA You were never invited. Sister invited Mr. Old Name. That's not you. If she wants you to go, she needs to at least invite You.", "NTA. And I know this isn\u2019t at all the point but I love that you took your wife\u2019s name! The more people who do it, the more normalized it will become, and the less tolerant we\u2019ll all learn to be with the misogyny exuding out of people like your sister.", "Just because you have history, doesn\u2019t mean you need to have a future. If she\u2019s not adding to your life now and only causing drama let her go. Your name is your name. Your life is your life. She can live her own. Be at peace, whatever that takes.", "OP's wife here, and no joke, this is exactly what I told him to do. I even asked our mail carrier if she'd help us fake that it couldn't be delivered because the name was wrong. \ud83d\ude02 Unfortunately, it didn't work out, but great idea.", "This is exactly what should have been done.  Period", "I remember seeing your engagement post in the Stardew Valley sub! It very much made/makes me smile!\n\nSorry to hear y'all are dealing with your SIL's drama.", "I looked at the post and I just wanted to say wow to the ring!!! It\u2019s absolutely gorgeous!!", "His sister\u2019s behavior is simply not normal. I have a feeling it falls under some psychological label if a qualified person can assess her.\n\nIt\u2019s shocking that her behavior is being given a pass by your husband\u2019s extended family. Maybe they simply want her to get off their backs and so are hounding him to attend the wedding for the sake of their peace of mind.\n\nYour MIL agreeing to his wish not to attend the wedding and the other siblings dropping out of the wedding- those actions say it all.", "Everyone is bailing on the wedding because the sister is a psycho.   Maybe she finally learns.  But she won\u2019t.", "That engagement post is adorable!", "Might want to link the post directly, scrolling past pages and pages of cats (while very cute!) And stardew valley posts got boring when looking for the hot gossip. But your SIL sounds unhinged.", "I got my bf, soon to be fiancee, that SAME sdv necklace. Good omens!", "Who did mom go with to your wedding?", "Ma'am, I hope someone provides a video feed of the wedding for you two.  Because it sounds like Sister Dearest is going to pop like a cork at that shindig, and it would be a shame to miss such a prime-time pay-per-view event.", "I wonder who the groom is and what he\u2019s thinking.  There\u2019s still time for him to run.", "And being stressed is not an excuse to be mean and hurtful\nI'd have just said, let me decrease your stress by removing me and my family away from your vicinity. Less people, less stress", "Hope sister's finance is making note of how many of her siblings are bailing from the wedding. He should consider doing that himself!", "My sister invited my grandmother who my mother has gone NC with for 14 years. she is just as bad as my sister", "I like your way of thinking.", "That\u2019s his wife bro\u2026no", "I really wish it had worked. I'm not above being petty.", "Oh, that made my night!  The part about remembering our post, not the drama, ha ha. Thank you so much! I had that Mermaid's Pendant on under my dress when we got married. :D", "That's odd, because for me on both desktop and the app, my pinned posts show up right at the top. The engagement post is one of them. Huh, maybe it only does that for me.", "This is like the Trinity test from Oppenheimer.  It's fascinating horror, but you better have welding goggles on...\n\nSo, what, the groom took one look at her and sighed \"ah, no safewords...\"", "My mom put no such person at this address when her brother addressed a Christmas card with her maiden name after dad died.  Mailman took it.", "I\u2019d cut it up into little pieces, shove it into another envelope, and send it back.", "\ud83e\udd23 you pinned them, we didn't \ud83e\udd23\n\nAlso, very cute cat, and I LOVE the name!", "Good for your mom. Sorry she had to go through that", "Oooooh, thank you. I've been on reddit all this time and somehow never knew that. I added a link!"]}
