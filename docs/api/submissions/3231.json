I have been waiting for this for years and have been over the moon these past couple months. \n\nLast week his little sister(F20) got engaged so I planned a celebration dinner for their family to see them and express their happiness for them. When no one on his side even blinked when we got engaged or said congratulations I wanted to do something so she felt special. \n\nAt dinner it came up they are planning a destination wedding 1 month after our wedding.  \n\nOf course my fianc\u00e9 wants to be there for his sister but financially that's a lot right after our wedding that we are already budgeting for. \nWe're looking at solutions to this but my fianc\u00e9 suggested we post pone our wedding until after theirs so we can resave. His reasoning for this is that he doesn't want me to give up aspects for our wedding so that we can afford to go to theirs. While this has good intentions I selfishly don't want to wait any longer to be his wife. I also don't want be over 30 by the time we get married. I already have my dress, our decor and our venue.\n\nHe suggested we could elope and have a reception later but it feels like I'm getting the short end of the stick.\n\nWould jt be incredibly rude to ask that they wait a few months as it's mostly a trip anyways? Who wouldn't want to go to Cuba in the winter?!\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is very upset saying that we can't afford both, I don't want him to miss his sisters wedding or feel like I'm asking him to pick me over her but I don't want to wait 3+ years fie our wedding to accommodate theirs.

I mean you booked your venue. \n\nIf it was me, I would not ask your fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister to wait a few months. I would just say that unfortunately we cannot afford to go to a destination wedding right after our own wedding and let her make the choice. \n\nIf she\u2019s still sticking to the date then it means that the date matters more than your presence. And why waste money to go somewhere where your presence doesn\u2019t matter.", "NTA, your future SIL is being really awful to her family too because most people probably can't afford to attend two weddings, and one of them being a destination wedding, within a month of each other.\n\nBut I highly doubt asking them to postpone will end well, it would be better to mention that you can't afford to attend so soon after your own wedding and hope they understand but honestly they're not going to care either way. If they cared they wouldn't have made their date so soon after yours in the first place.\n\nLike some other people said, your biggest issue here is your fiance. He priority should be your wedding together, but I do also feel for him because I'm betting he's been catering to his baby sister's whims his whole life so this feels normal for him.\n\nYou're getting a sneak peak of the rest of your life with him, unless he does some serious introspection he won't change and he will always put his sister's wants above your needs.", "Info: have you asked your fianc\u00e9 why his sister\u2019s wedding is more important than his own?", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 is putting his sister\u2019s wedding above his own. You need to have a long conversation with him. Sadly, you might have to make an ultimatum. I\u2019m not a fan of them but you clearly don\u2019t wanna wait any longer and you\u2019re gonna have to let him decide.

Why move yours when it  was booked first, partially paid for and you\u2019ve been engaged several years\u2026 something seems off here. Does he defo want to get married? Because this makes zero sense. \n\nThe sister is being rude booking hers a month after yours.

So at least yall will have kids soon", "NTA. \nOn what planet is his sister\u2019s wedding more important than his own ?", "NTA.

Maybe your fiance is worried people will save to attend his sister's destination wedding not come to yours to save money.", "His response and reactions would give me \ud83d\udcaf pause on making our relationship legal. Look up sunken cost fallacy. This is what your life could look like. Always coming in second to sister's needs, wants, desires... Reexamine the last 6 years as if you were a neutral 3rd party. What do you see?", "NTA, HOWEVER if you ask them to change the date you would be verging on AH territory. That said you absolutely need to sit down with your fiance and ask him to explain to you in full technicolor why his sister's wedding is more important than yours. Because like it or not that is exactly what he's saying by asking you to postpone or drastically change all plans like this.\n\nAlso its extremely shitty on his sister's part to do this. Destination weddings are already hit or miss on attendance(more so when the guests have to pay for themselves) so by picking the month after your planned wedding she's putting her and her brother's entire family in a tight spot as well, especially out of town family already traveling to your wedding.", "100% NTA. She is however the ah. Why would she have planned a destination wedding so close to your wedding? That's really not ok. Your fiance is also being a jerk for not standing with you. Stand your ground and don't move your wedding", "NTA\n\nHowever, how expensive is his sister's wedding?? You compare the expenses for your wedding (where you pay for food, venue, band, photos, flower arrangements etc etc), with being guests at another wedding. \n\nIt's a trip: airplane & hotel room. It's expensive, but surely not comparable to planning an entire wedding.\n\nCan't your family help? With a temporary loan? \n\nIf it's truthy impossible for you to afford both events, be honest with the sister. Ask for her advice. Maybe (if she's much better financially, since she can afford a destination wedding), she'll offer to pay for her brother's (and your) accomodations!", "NTA - why is her wedding more or a priority to him then yours/his own???", "NTA. A similar thing happened to a friend of mine and the family was pretty annoyed at the second wedding being booked for a few weeks later. Understandably. \n\nI'm most concerned your future husband is so dismissive of your feelings and the fact you've already booked and moved towards organising things and announced your date.", "NTA, ask your fianc\u00e9 why he is prioritising his sisters wedding over his own.\n\nI *am* a fianc\u00e9, if my younger sibling tried to do this there's no way in hell I'd disappoint my fianc\u00e9e and scale down our wedding, I'd just say \"sorry, you knew when my wedding was first, I can't come\"\n\nI cannot WAIT to get married to my fianc\u00e9e, I couldn't imagine hurting her like this.

You and your fianc\u00e9 already have your dress, the venue, and the decoration and have been planning your wedding since July. Your wedding should take priority over the SIL\u2019s wedding. The SIL is risking losing a lot of guests by planning a destination wedding that will occur so soon after when yours is scheduled. \n\nHowever, that\u2019s not the issue. The issue is that your fianc\u00e9, who should care about the wedding and be looking forward to the marriage, is willing to postpone it for his sister\u2019s wedding. My fear is that he only proposed because he knew he\u2019d lose you if he didn\u2019t, and is only going through the motions. He might even be looking for an excuse to end it and have it not be his fault.

If you planned your wedding first, chose the day first and lil' sis knew it, have your wedding, to hell with her, let the chips fall where they may.

And from your reply to whether she knew when your wedding was scheduled, it sounds like she is a bit of an A-H for scheduling a destination wedding so soon after your wedding.

If you & your needs/wants were a priority, you would have been married years ago. My guess is, he\u2019s only proposed to \u201cshut you up\u201d & is wanting to postpone for as long as possible. He knew offering to elope was a nonstarter for you & that you\u2019d never take him up on it. And if you had, he would have found some way to weasel out of it. You\u2019ve wasted 6 years with this man. It\u2019s time to wake up & realize he doesn\u2019t really want to get married. Cut your losses & move on. You will always be a low priority to him.

I am super close to my sister and would never miss her wedding. But she would never be so selfish and plan it 1 month after mine. Who does that?

Perhaps you should rethink your relationship with him?", "NTA Why are you even making concessions for this? You were engaged first. You've waited years for your big moment. Now you are being asked to sacrifice that for his sister? No. That's just wrong. I also think it's not right to ask your SIL to postpone.

If he truly wants to go, I think he needs to find another way instead of expecting you to get the short end of the stick in this.\n\nEdit to add that I've read some of the other comments and those posts are also spot on.

I have been waiting for this for years and have been over the moon these past couple months. \n\nLast week his little sister(F20) got engaged so I planned a celebration dinner for their family to see them and express their happiness for them. When no one on his side even blinked when we got engaged or said congratulations I wanted to do something so she felt special. \n\nAt dinner it came up they are planning a destination wedding 1 month after our wedding.  \n\nOf course my fianc\u00e9 wants to be there for his sister but financially that's a lot right after our wedding that we are already budgeting for. \nWe're looking at solutions to this but my fianc\u00e9 suggested we post pone our wedding until after theirs so we can resave. His reasoning for this is that he doesn't want me to give up aspects for our wedding so that we can afford to go to theirs. While this has good intentions I selfishly don't want to wait any longer to be his wife. I also don't want be over 30 by the time we get married. I already have my dress, our decor and our venue.\n\nHe suggested we could elope and have a reception later but it feels like I'm getting the short end of the stick.\n\nWould jt be incredibly rude to ask that they wait a few months as it's mostly a trip anyways? Who wouldn't want to go to Cuba in the winter?!\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is very upset saying that we can't afford both, I don't want him to miss his sisters wedding or feel like I'm asking him to pick me over her but I don't want to wait 3+ years fie our wedding to accommodate theirs.
