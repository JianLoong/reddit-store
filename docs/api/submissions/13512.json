I won't wait more than 20 mins for a Dr. If it is constant, I will just find a new Dr. and review them. NTA and this sort of practice needs to stop with Dr's. Sure as heck they would charge YOU for being late or not showing up.", "Send a bill for your time. Use her rate. NTA.", "Exactly.

The office pushed me to reschedule again and had an attitude when I told them I would only schedule after work. I hung up and never went back, then found the provider I've been seeing for over 2yrs now. He's missed a couple appointments, but also has let me go over, or seen me when I wasn't on the schedule way more than he's been late. Also saw me for almost an entire year for free when I lost my job and insurance. There are amazing providers out there, it can just be hard to find them unfortunately.", "So I asked her today if there was a better time available for her but I ask every time when scheduling as I only need the specific day, not a specific time and this is what she chooses. I asked about the lengthy wait time and she is stating that it is because my case is more complex so it takes more time to review before seeing me. I can understand that however, again, she wasn\u2019t even in the office until an hour of waiting had passed. And that\u2019s not including the 30 minutes later that I arrived. I\u2019m not sure, I try to give people the benefit of doubt and that some things take time.

One day I so fed up because I waited for 2 hours, I told them I was never coming back again, and I was going to bill them for my time. Lol! I sent them a bill!

An average appointment takes X minutes, but you have enough patients and walk-ins that suddenly it's X+Y. That's not to say they don't do a shitty job planning ahead, but  economically, they're encouraged to fit in as many patients in a day as possible, and emergencies mean more money.\n\nTherapists have a set time. 50 minutes with a patient typically, with a 10 minute break between. Sure emergencies happen, but it's a lot easier to time manage there.", "Many over schedule patients for more $ neither is acceptable.", "It's not usually the doctors who over schedule, but the management companies for the medical facilities only allowing short appointment times on schedules", "Yes, but half the population would also complain about the doctor sitting around doing nothing and not seeing them if they scheduled big gaps between patients to ensure that they would always be seen at their exact appointment time. \n\n>Many over schedule patients for more $ neither is acceptable.\n\nAnd honestly, I don't truly buy this excuse.\n\nThey schedule appointments on what they hope is an appropriate schedule.\n\nThe ultimate result of oversheduling is simply being open later, working longer hours, and unhappy patients. \n\nBut if they deliberately opened later, you'd have the same hours, same expenses, but happy patients. \n\nPeople would be Queueing up to use them so they don't have to take time off work to see the Doctor or pay a hefty ER bill"]}
