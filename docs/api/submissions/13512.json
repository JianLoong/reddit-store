He's missed a couple appointments, but also has let me go over, or seen me when I wasn't on the schedule way more than he's been late.

There are amazing providers out there, it can just be hard to find them unfortunately.", "So I asked her today if there was a better time available for her but I ask every time when scheduling as I only need the specific day, not a specific time and this is what she chooses. I asked about the lengthy wait time and she is stating that it is because my case is more complex so it takes more time to review before seeing me. I can understand that however, again, she wasn\u2019t even in the office until an hour of waiting had passed. And that\u2019s not including the 30 minutes later that I arrived.

That's clearly just a lie though. Taking a third of the working day to 'review notes' is just absolute bullshit."]}
