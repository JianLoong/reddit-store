It's just a simple evening with snacks booze and movies and some random talks. \n\nSo past weekend my friend 'Alex' hosted the movie night. Alex's sister decided to join us and we had no problem in that as she had joined us before. We were talking about movie to watch and she suddenly out of  owhere told me that there is no need to wear so much of makeup it's a night in. So I replied I am not wearing makeup. But she started calling me a liar and told me that last time when we met my sink was more darker, either I have too much keep on or have done cosmetic procedure to lighten my skin. And then wen on a Rant about how it's raisit of me to lighten my skin as many people suffer due to their skin being of darker colour.\n\nAfter she had done talking I explained to her that I have translucent skin, so depending on the weather and on my energy levels my skin may look brighter or dull, I sometimes 9ut light makeup so redness of my face doesn't show when I am too hot or tired, but his wasn't one of those times. And told her I was not wearing makeup. She didn't belive me and told my bf, do you really want to stay with such a lying b*tch. This was uncalled for so I asked her to mind her own business and not poke her nose where it's not needed. \n\nShe got silent went to her room and I thought that was it, but I guess she told her mom what happend and she came down and told me to not talk to her daughter like that in her house or I could leave. \n\nAlex was very apologetic and told me to ignore them, so we enjoyed the night. But now I feel I could have just ignored her and not put damper on our night.
