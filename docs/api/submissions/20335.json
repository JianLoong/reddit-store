I would even say it's a stupid move to do it without the offer if you otherwise don't have a way to cover the expense. The is a \"sure thing\" is not a sure thing until it is actually done.

However, if you want to placate your spouse, you could suggest making the an offer CONTINGENT on your spouse receiving an acceptable offer of employment within a specified period of time. Otherwise you\u2019ll be out your earnest money if you have an accepted offer and the job doesn\u2019t come through. \n\nFurthermore your mortgage application will likely be declined without proof of income in this new location, so spouse is putting the cart ahead of the horse here.", "NTA \n\nYour spouse is being ridiculous.

Who does this?", "Tell your son to follow up. Same thing happened to my old coworker. Turned out the recruiter left the company right when our manager sent over the request to hire her. She thought she'd been ghosted; he thought she ghosted them. Once she reached out to our manager for an update, he realized what happened and the offer was sent out.", "I don\u2019t gather by the post that this is the problem you think it is. Get a pre-approval and put the offer down. It still takes some days for offers to be reviewed by the seller and for them to make a decision. It\u2019s not a contract, it\u2019s not earnest money, it\u2019s not a guarantee of purchase. It\u2019s just an offer to make sure your name is in the pot if the time comes to put your money where your mouth is.", "NTA.  The last thing you want is a house payment where you don't live.", "NTA.  It isn't that you do not trust your spouse, it is that there is no reason to believe an offer will be made when one has not been made yet.  Employers are unpredictable and job position openings change.", "NTA. It\u2019s likely that your loan wouldn\u2019t be able to close without the job offer letter anyway if their employment is needed to qualify. I work for a mortgage company and we require a firm start date and confirmation that contingencies to employment have been cleared. If your income would cover what\u2019s needed for the loan, that could work for closing the loan, but it\u2019s fair to not want to move without an offer.", "NTA - there\u2019s no job there right now, it\u2019s just an expectation or desire.  If you move now and the job offer isn\u2019t forthcoming what happens then?", "Good point!"]}
