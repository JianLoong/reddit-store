I can't imagine asking my husband to not leave a room in his own home or not be around his kid when others are over, mine was always around for play dates.", "NTA This is wild. You are in your own home. You don\u2019t look like a creeper for picking up a cat. That doesn\u2019t even make sense. Have you asked her WHY you should stay out of sight? Have these women or children never seen a male or a dad before? Of course they have. I don\u2019t get what the big deal is.", "Nta. This is very weird to me, especially in this current culture where a lot of people WFH. Your wife seems oblivious to today\u2019s world.", "NTA\n\nWhat's up with your wife? SERIOUSLY, what's up with your wife?   \nThis is all very strange.", "Thank you for the support.  I was really beginning to question myself here.", "NTA that\u2019s weird AF, why would you hide from playdates? TF is that\u2026", "NTA.  \n\nNot going to lie, based on the title I was assuming that you'd have an issue relating to your daughter's playdates disrupting your work.\n\nThe only scenario I can think of is that your wife thinks WFH \"doesn't count\" and has told her friends that you work outside the home to make it seem like you're not \"a failure\".  Which is a real asshole move.", "NTA. That is some weird shit.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur wife is an abusive AH. Demand couple's therapy - and if that does not help, go for a divorce.", "Today I was wearing pajama bottoms and a tshirt, but they are loos fitting.  Not like anything being shown.", "NTA. In your wife's mind, it's all about her image. She sounds really insecure about the fact that you WFH instead of going to a traditional workplace every day. As long as you're hidden away, she can pretend you're not there at all.", "NTA - your home, you should be able to move around your home whenever you want.", "NTA. I have a similar work/family situation to you and have never been told I have to stay out of sight.", "Put some shorts or pants on - maybe its the pajamas but still NTA", "NTA\n\nsurely it would be more creepy for them to never see you and start rumours about the phantom lurker in the closed room!", "C'mon dude.  Put your foot down.  Tell your wife NO.  It is your house too.  How does getting a cup of coffee make you look \"like a creeper\"?   Inform your wife that you will be leaving your office AS NEEDED, and if she has a problem with it, then SHE can either no host play dates or host them elsewhere.  You are NTA.  Btw, if my wife thought I was a creep, I would re-examine my marriage.", "NTA.\n\nI actually think the solution might be the opposite, i.e. when your wife has anyone over, you (where possible) take 2 minutes out of your day to introduce yourself soon after they arrive.\n\nThat way, if they see you about the house later, they know who you are and it's not weird.", "NTA It's also your home. If she doesn't want you to move out of the room, then suggest that you turn the master bedroom with ensuite into your new home office complete with bar fridge, microwave and kettle set up and that way you'll be able to stay in your office and not come out when she's hosting a play date.\n\nThis will mean she'll have to give up the master bedroom, and if she doesn't like it too bad, after all a smaller room should be acceptable to her, because after all she's more interested in the wellbeing of her guests rather than you her husband who also ha-pens to be able to work from home too.", "Info: are you wearing pants?", "NTA", "Hmmm.

This is your home, and your office, how does it make you look like a creeper to come out of your office and walk around your own home?  I would say she has some issues here.", "NTA. That is a horribly controlling thing to do, not normal whatsoever. Unless your WFH job is nude model, the only reason your wife is giving you the stink eye is that she's a controlling....unkind word for a woman.", "Whatever your wife is smoking she needs to share. NTA.", "NTA - I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s no modesty issue (like, hijabs) or else you would have mentioned it. \n\nThis is strange behavior.  Is she ashamed of you?", "This is very weird.  I assume that you are fully dressed in business casual, shaved, recent haircut.  Why this, what does your wife say is the rationale, is she uncomfortable that you are working from home, are all the other fathers working at the office?\n\n***My wife wants me to not leave my office at all.

You live there and I'm pretty sure you contribute to the household.  Do not allow her to treat you this way.  It is so wrong.", "NTA. Your wife sounds incredibly weird and unpleasant. Strangest shit I\u2019ve ever heard.", "Agreed. As a mom who has been to houses of other moms I was just getting to know for playdates I'd be really creeped out by someone hiding away and not even bothering to say hi, its manners to introduce yourself at least.\n\nI get wanting space and not to be crowded but this is over the top.", "She thinks moms will be uncomfortable with having a man in the house.", "I\u2019d be questioning why you are in a relationship with someone who things you are so dangerous / disgusting. One of the weirdest things I\u2019ve ever seen on here and that\u2019s saying something. Wife needs serious therapy.", "I\u2019m a single dad divorced with my 2 daughters 50% of the time. The kids always want sleepovers. The friends are great, all grown now mostly in to high school but when they were younger, I\u2019ve made em all choccy chip pancakes in the morning, played board games with them, it\u2019s fun and not cringe. We are human beings, and dads, and dads are pretty special. When we are allowed to be.\n\nI\u2019ve seen my share of \u201cdad discrimination\u201d, but you can\u2019t change peoples minds often, and I respect them for having their own opinions, but I refuse to not be who I am. A loving dad with a few corny jokes up his sleeve. \n\nYour wife is behaving very oddly. Definitely get that checked out. Therapy is a great place with the third party and all. Do it because you love her, and your kids. Just advice from a dad since 2007.", "Okay. Yes. I would be clothes on (you don\u2019t have to put on a suit and tie but at least shorts and a t-shirt) I mean, I WFH in my PJs all the time (favorite part of WFH along with the commute \ud83d\ude01) but if I know someone is coming over, I shower and dress. I do think it\u2019s a little weird to have people in your house while you\u2019re wearing pajamas.", "I'm going to chime in here and say that it's your house, if you're more comfortable in pajama bottoms then that's fine. Not like your shirtless or wandering around in just your underwear.", "Put on actual pants when people are coming to your house, buddy. That would be my basic expectation as a mother coming over for a play date. Everyone in the house over age 2 should be wearing clothes, not pajamas.", "Wandering around your house in pyjamas or in a state of partial undress while guests are present is not great. Put proper clothes on.\n\nBut if that's her problem, she should say that instead of making you hide in your office.", "Seriously! It would be a cold day in Hades before my spouse grounded me to a room.  That\u2019s just not even a realistic ask for a (presumably) 8 hour work day. Definitely NTA!", "Exactly, we are Christian there is nothing untoward going on.  I know she is insecure and jealous and that stems from me being socially awkward.  Especially when we first were married, but it has been 17 years.", "If she\u2019s uncomfortable with her HUSBAND being in the house because he works FROM HOME, this is entirely her issue. Don\u2019t shut yourself away, don\u2019t avoid making drinks and using the bathroom. Your wife is being controlling and weird", "I mean, it\u2019d be weird to have a strange man in the house, but you\u2019re the dad! Normal interaction would be, \u201cthis is my hubs!\u201d I was gonna add \u201che works from home\u201d but honestly, that\u2019s kind of irrelevant. \n\nNTA.", "I mean ... most of the other moms have men in their houses, right? Men who are called things like \"husbands\" and \"fathers?\" Why doesn't that apply to you?", "That is absurd. She needs to let the other moms know that her husband is there and working instead of trying to be deceptive towards them. She\u2019s TA for doing this. I would understand if one of the kids or mom\u2019s have been abused in the past, but surely not all of them if there\u2019s multiples and even if that\u2019s so- that should be explained to you and to them that you\u2019re there in the house. Your wife is carrying around preconceived notions that they won\u2019t like a guy there and they\u2019re just not true.", "If a mom is uncomfortable with the child's father working in his office while the mother and kids have a play date in the living room, that's on her.\n\nSuch a mother should get therapy to help her understand that men are people, not monsters. Lord.", "but... you live there. and work there. tbh i think it would be weird if they found out you were always there but they never saw you, even for a second.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your wife is really insecure about you being around the other moms.", "Then she has a problem, not you.", "I\u2019d be weirded out by a husband HIDING OUT. That\u2019s WAY more creepy.", "The only time I could even sympathize is if this was a baby playgroup and the moms openly breastfed. But that doesn\u2019t sound at all to be the case. \n\nI hate to imply this, but maybe wife and friends trash talk?", "Pay the bills and you can tell me what pants I have to wear. Pajama pants are pants gtfo", "Yes, this would be even stranger. Much better to come out, say a quick hello, then head back to work. Otherwise I'd bet money that the other mums will be talking about the strange father who doesn't look at them or speak to them. It would come across as quite anti social and rude.", "NTA, you have a right to leave your office as needed when working from home. Is your wife dealing with some unresolved trauma? Are the kids at an age where maybe your wife was molested by a friend's dad when she was a kid? Does your wife feel like you have been sexually coercive towards her and she now considers you a danger? Sounds like your family may need therapy to figure out why she wants to hide you in a room.", "NTA. Very weird.  Your wife should actually be telling these women: my husband works from home so you may see him getting a cup of coffee and we do our best not to disturb him while he's working.", "NTA... your wife is unhinged. You are a person, you live and work in your home. I cant even imagine what her problem is.\n\nI have 2 close friends with WFH  husbands. They even stop and have coffee with us sometimes.", "It\u2019s weirder to keep that info from parents who\u2019s kids are coming for playdates. Makes it seem like she\u2019s got something to hide. That\u2019s super odd - NTA", "She\u2019s the AH. Why wouldn\u2019t you be able to walk through? Sounds so weird", "My husband WFH and will say hi to my clients if he's making coffee etc when they pass by the kitchen.  It would be weird if he hid out!  And for playdates, he is the dad and it's completely normal for him to expect to meet his kids' friends!  Doesn't your wife meet the friends' husbands/dads at other playdates?\n\nNTA.  I get that maybe the other moms would feel awkward being alone with you, but that's not happening here!", "That's ridiculous. And sexist.", "How does she think the other mums became mums?", "No. They are decent and cover the parts that need to be covered. Who cares what they look like if you are at home?", "NTA but I don't see what being Christian has to do with anything", "It actually is relevant because the kids there for the play date should learn he isn't to be disturbed because he's working.", "Point. I was thinking it wasn\u2019t necessary to explain why the dad would be in the house he lives.", "NTA. Very weird.", "This is super not cool. NTA. You need to sit down with your wife and talk this out.", "NTA.  You live there.  It's your house too.  You don't vanish just because she has people over.", "NTA. As a mom, I think it is completely normal to tell people \"My husband is working in that room XYZ\" and going on with life.  Of course a husband emerges into the house to do normal life-things, like catching a cat or a bathroom visit.\n\nYour wife seems oddly weird about all of this.", "YES!!! Exactly this!", "Mate, this is abusive.", "Do these women know your wife is married? Good gravy. It's only weird because she makes it weird.", "Haha right!? And sounds like mom doesn\u2019t work. So basically she wants dad locked in a room all day while she has fun?", "Usually if we have guest I do wear pants, but today they weren't coming in."]}
