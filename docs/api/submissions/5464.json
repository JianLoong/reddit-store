I understand why your wife wants her gifts wrapped - I\u2019m the same way.

I also understand why you struggle with wrapping gifts (my boyfriend struggles with it and sometimes get stressed that it doesn\u2019t look perfect), and that it may be triggering for you based on your childhood experiences. I think there are several good compromises here. 1) There are lots of little stores that offer gift wrapping services - for example, there is a little post \u2018n ship store down the street from me that offers it. It\u2019s relatively cheap and looks professional. 2) Pay a nearby teenager/student to do it for you, especially if you know someone who is \u2018crafty\u2019.

Sometimes what we try to do isn't enough. Trauma or not. And it sucks to hear it but it's true. Sometimes we let people down by not getting past our own shit. She's allowed to be hurt by that too. \n\nHaving your partner wrap their own presents after they told you it's important to them is being a bad partner (in this action, not a bad partner in the scope of things, but in this action)", "The fact that you're focusing on the couple of gift bags instead of the 90% of her presents that are wrapped makes me think you're just trying to do anything to justify the wife being an asshole.", "Of the gifts that I purchased for her.", "Ah I read shipping box as shopping bag somehow.", "Fine, I'll do the work for you \ud83d\ude44\n\n\"I literally get like a panic attack thinking about wrapping a gift. Yes I know it's stupid.\".\n\nThat sounds a lot like hating to wrapping gifts and being currently incapable to do so.", "I suppose I could do it. It doesn't seem like a difficult task.  But I also have zero interest in doing it.  But how hard could it be. You wrap a box in wrapping paper and tape it. Seems simple enough. But I've never done it.", "She\u2019s trying to invalidate the effort he\u2019s putting in by micromanaging her presents. He\u2019s definitely not the asshole for not wrapping with gift wrap but she definitely is for this behavior. She cares so much about what others think that she is rewrapping? She needs serious therapy if this is something that is so important. She should be caring about the gift not the wrapping. She is absolutely the asshole", "Fair on the alternative arrangements to wrap and totally agree on your hopes for them.\n\nHappy christmas!", "This is the first time it's been an issue because it is the first time I didn't get all her gifts professionally wrapped.", "The other gifts are wrapped because the company where he got it from offer gift wrapping. So he\u2019s not opposed to paying for gift wrapping when it\u2019s an option. And he also said it was two gifts left that wasn\u2019t wrapped. Her reasoning for not wanting to wrap her own gifts, is not because she wants to be surprised. She just wants to post pictures. It\u2019s not that the effort isn\u2019t good enough for her. The effort isn\u2019t good enough to post pictures. \n\nEdit: \nWhat\u2019s depression is her telling him to \u201cman up\u201d when she knows there is an emotional cause for why he doesn\u2019t like wrapping gifts.", "He's hiding that detail but that's definitely what flips it to YTA for me. Like at least check you got what you ordered and nothing is broken or damaged. Then put the stuff in nice gift bags or even those gift boxes you can reuse but not the whole darn brown cardboard box just tossed in there!", "[deleted]", "She cares what *she* thinks. She can like them looking nice just for herself you know? \n\nThat's not micromanaging to ask for more effort. She's allowed to prefer things a certain way. \n\nShe's not an asshole for wanting things to look nice and cohesive. \n\nShe's an asshole for how she spoke to them for sure. \n\nIt feels like you're projecting your own feelings of people invalidating your efforts onto this woman, and I get it. Being told your effort isn't enough sucks but that doesn't mean it'll always be enough. And again there is middle ground, and compromise. However this compromise obviously isn't working. \n\nI'm sure they can resolve it together if they actually both listened to each other. And she should also probably consider some therapy for her behavior regarding this issue.", "How big are the gifts in the bag?", "Ah. Thanks for the extra context! In which case I feel like she's allowed to be disappointed but she absolutely should not have spoken to you like that. \n\nI do think there are other solutions as I've stated a few times now but this is your first time with the issue so it's fair they weren't your first thought and you did what you thought was best. \n\nI'm sure it won't be a big deal in the long run. But please do talk to her about the way she spoke to you.", "That's my whole point though. He can get someone else to wrap if it's that important to her. \n\nAnd I'm assuming the rest of their relationship is well and this is just a point of contention. \n\nI have 0 disagreement that her communication regarding the issue and their baggage surrounding was fucked and not okay. \n\nThose things can both be true, ya know? He could find an alternative like he has with the companies that wrap. It shouldn't be her responsibility. And also she was an asshole for talking to him like that and it isn't excusable.", "I added an edit to be clear that I did not change the box.", "Ohhh you just don't respect mental health and understand that it can manifest in the weirdest smallest ways. Got ya", "Dude why are you getting personal. I don\u2019t have these issues and if I did, I wouldn\u2019t be married to someone who would shit on my efforts like this woman is. This isn\u2019t a compromise because she\u2019s being an asshole and talking down to him. He put in the effort and she is acting like a crazy person. Rewrapping your own presents is absolutely micromanaging", "The two gifts are each about the size of a toaster oven.", "He did find an alternative, he put the gift in the bag. Nine other gifts are wrapped. There\u2019s no way to say that he didn\u2019t put in the effort. Any person who complains about TWO gifts out of ELEVEN being in the bag is ungrateful.  82% of her gifts are wrapped. The other 18% are in bags, still you in the box, but in a bag. Therefore 100% of her gifts are in some form of wrapping.", "I'd still recommend opening them and checking the boxes and using gift boxes instead. Tie a ribbon around it and she still gets to undo something. But she also sounds chronically online.", "Okay. I was thinking the gifts were small and  putting them in a bag would probably make the most sense but either way anything can go in the bag. And those would probably cost a pretty penny to wrap professionally.", "I think that's fair. And i personally would think that should be more than enough, however. \n\nWhat matters is them. Both of them. (Because they are in a relationship and hopefully love each other and want to make each other happy)\n\nShe's being nitpicky for sure and an asshole to her partner. \n\nBut at the end of the day it's about a small thing to make your partner happy. It's a weird hill to die on when there are alternatives that could make them both happy is all I'm saying. (I'm in no way trying to say OP should force themselves  through a panic attack to wrap it themself)\n\nHowever OP said it's the first time it's been an issue, so it seems like it threw them both for a loop and while he did nothing wrong she reacted very poorly and should be held accountable for her actions. I don't think she should have had to wrap her own presents but it is what it is. \n\nShe's allowed to be bummed it wasn't what she wanted but she's not allowed to be an ass to her spouse about it.\n\nShe's not evil for not liking bags and feeling like they don't show effort. She's an asshole for treating her partner poorly."]}
