I also understand why you struggle with wrapping gifts (my boyfriend struggles with it and sometimes get stressed that it doesn\u2019t look perfect), and that it may be triggering for you based on your childhood experiences. I think there are several good compromises here. 1) There are lots of little stores that offer gift wrapping services - for example, there is a little post \u2018n ship store down the street from me that offers it. It\u2019s relatively cheap and looks professional. 2) Pay a nearby teenager/student to do it for you, especially if you know someone who is \u2018crafty\u2019.

So I'm somewhat bemused that anyone would be panicked by the thought. I'm not sure if there are any AHs here but you are obviously not in harmony with each other. This is something that has frustrated her for many years, and I completely understand - she wants you to make a fuss of her in a way that presumably has personal importance for her, and you don't understand why that's a thing.

Maybe she doesn't understand why it is such a problem for you. Anyway.

The people saying it's \"about the effort\" should ask her to make an effort to understand trauma and put her spouse before her need to post things online.", "I duck tape my gifts. Some times add zip ties. I\u2019ve cuz up wrapping paper and pieces them together so there are multiple different papers. If she\u2019s going to complain about how it\u2019s wrapped.  I would start getting creative. Wrapped doesn\u2019t mean with wrapping paper.", "NTA \n\nAt first I was like \u201cmy dude, just pay a neighbour\u2019s kid/relative to do it or stand your ground with your bag\u201d then I read she wants it to be able to take photos to post and I was like nahhhh she needs to get a grip and appreciate that you\u2019re even in a position that you can buy gifts RN. Gift bags are absolutely wrapping and it sounds a bit like she doesn\u2019t care what you get her, only that it gets her likes. Ew", "Lol. I did gift bags this year. They sell drawstring gift bags on Amazon. Easy Peazy. Add an extra bow and voila - they look beautiful.", "NTA. What kind of gatekeeping bs is this? Gift bags aren\u2019t enough anymore? Apparently getting a thoughtful gift isn\u2019t enough, you now need to put more effort and stress into what\u2019s supposed to be a lovely time of year. Oh right she needs to post her wrapped gifts on social media so she can brag about how much you spoil her or something. \n\nIf you love her and it means so much to her, I would just get it over with so she\u2019s happy, but this is an absurd thing for her to be upset by.", "I only used gift bags this year. I also hate wrapping gifts, so bags for everyone! NTA. Your wife\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s also ridiculous she only does this to \u201cpost\u201d so she can get social media attention. Is the thought not what counts anymore??", "I love wrapping gifts, would totally take this job if someone in my neighborhood asked.", "This is exactly my thinking.", "Yeah. Sometimes in marriage ya gotta pick ya battles. I've learned that something minor to me could be something that means a lot to my wife. So if it isn't something ridiculously time consuming or more difficult, and the alternative is just do it a different way, then I just do it for her. I get he has trauma over wrapping gifts, but I mean... C'mon it's wrapping a present.", "We have 2 bags in my parents house that are 20 years old. 1 still has the original tag on it. I use them every damn year when I wrap my moms presents that dad buys. Bags are so useful! Hell, my grandma would painstakingly unwrap gifts so she could save the wrapping paper! My grandpa still paper she saved from over 50 years ago!", "My friends and I used to splurge on really nice, pretty gift bags for each other\u2019s kids birthdays specifically so we could all reuse them\ud83d\ude01", "Also, no need to faff about trying to find sellotape and scissors to cut the wrapping paper then having to wonder if you have enough to wrap the whole thing! I need to start using gift bags for adults and only wrapping the kids presents\u2026", "My family has the legendary Victoria secret bag that gets passed around between the men because of my wrapping my brothers present in it 25 years ago\ud83e\udd23", "My grandma had a cloth bag for each of her grand children! They were always so nice to see under the tree.", "It's much easier if you just get those hanging tags so you can cut them off the handles and put a new one on.", "The point is, I\u2019m using an extreme example to showcase the trauma that people can have. People on AITA are always talking about how certain behaviour traumatises kids and now when the kid is an adult (OP), suddenly he just has to get over it.", "I made cloth bags this year for my holiday guests. Dad got cardinals, my sister A got dogs/paw prints, sister M got gnomes, my husband is plaid in green and I am winter fabric. It was a bit of money up front but it all looks very nice under the tree and very little waste. The leftover fabric will be made into a winter table runner.", "I did this about 15 years ago.. it changed my life. In happy ways. Christmas was so much less stressful.", "I keep boxes with lids and glue wrapping paper to them to be reused!", "Nta, I'm sorry you have trauma connected to someone that's meant to be happy\n\nEdit: something* my bad", "NTA, and frankly anyone who responds to trauma by saying \u201cman up\u201d is an AH.\n\nBut if I may give one piece of advice? (I know this is not an advice sub...) Gift *boxes*. Reusable, unwrappable, and you can put different (reusable fabric) ribbon on them each year, and they\u2019re *extremely* Instagrammable if that\u2019s what your wife is into. We still wrap a few things in paper each year, if they\u2019re too big for boxes, but for the most part we do shiny reusable boxes in a variety of colours and Christmas prints, tied with silk and organza and velvet ribbons.\n\nStoring them is the only pain, but we have a pretty big attic, luckily, and some are stackable.", "NTA. If this is the basis for a relationship, my partner and I will be separating on Xmas Day. I'm lucky to get a box, let alone wrapping paper. It doesn't matter.", "There is such a thing as reusable wrapping paper\u2026 \n\nWrap because it\u2019s what she needs to feel loved by you, gifts if service is obviously one of her love languages.", "NTA. OP, I use gift bags for everyone because I can\u2019t wrap for shit. I\u2019ve tried throughout the years and I was just never able to get the hang of it. So I tell everyone every Christmas they\u2019re getting bags instead to remind them, because I have gotten shit in the past about gifts not being wrapped. As long as the gift is covered accordingly, that\u2019s all that matters", "Wait, you buy your wife presents?  She doesn\u2019t have to buy them herself and surprise you with what \u201cyou\u201d got her?  \ud83e\udd14. NTA IMO", "NTA. With a gigantic bow on top. \n\nNot only is it perfectly acceptable to use gift bags (Team Giftbag FTW), but considering your trauma, it's EVEN more acceptable. \n\nYour wife is being a jerk.", "YTA. Make an effort. It doesn't take much effort to learn how to wrap things and it's your wife not worth it?", "I\u2019ve paid someone the last two years to come in and wrap all my presents.   Like OP, I truly hate wrapping gifts.   I actually gives me anxiety.    Having them all done nicely for me change my holiday stress level so much.", "She doesn't care about \"magic and joy\" unless those are two new social media sites she can post the presents to for those sweet clicks. Plus if someone told me to \"man up and get over it\" about my trauma the only effort I'd make is an effort to divorce them.", "He has childhood trauma over it. Hes not comfortable wrapping. \n\nIts not like hes giving them to her unwrapped or something, ones he couldn't get wrapped by the merchant are in a gift bag.", ">  I'm sorry, but I don't believe OP gets a panic attack when he wraps presents\n\nIt's kind of shitty to accuse someone of lying about their trauma. It's completely believable to me that reenacting a traumatic childhood scenario would cause him to panic. It's not **extraordinarily easy** to undo psychological damage from your formative years and he says he's working on it.\n\nWife just wants pretty pictures for Instagram. If she cares more about that than her husband's mental health, yikes.", "No, he said a few of them didn\u2019t offer gift wrapping with the order. So that implies he did get her at least one thing on something like Amazon where you can get it wrapped", "Gift bags and tissue paper are communally owned, like tupperware. Whichever ones you have right now are the ones you own. They rotate out every year, so you always have the same amount.", "Ok?  Did you mean to reply to me?  I was just saying that his wife told him to \"man up\"."]}
