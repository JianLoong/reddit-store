Our friend groups include several people who have moved to different parts of the country, so our wedding was a mini-reunion of our friends in a way. \n\nMy wife and I had a large suite in the same hotel that held our reception. Our reception was a blast and ended at 10. We decided to invite a handful of friends to our suite for a quick (or so we thought) nightcap, for a final toast and to say some goodbyes (we were set to leave for our honeymoon on a very early flight the next morning).\n\nWell, most of our friends were quite tipsy, and started to overstay their welcome. My wife and I dropped some hints that it was time to end the party, that they should head to the hotel bar or whatever so we could have our \u201calone time.\u201d Still, they weren\u2019t taking the hint. \n\nThis is where my wife took things into her own hands. She disappeared for about 15 minutes and popped out of the bedroom all done up in her bridal lingerie outfit, strutted out and sat on my lap. They got the hint then! \n\nThey were out of there within 3 minutes - but not before one of my friends (unbeknownst to me) got a photo of my wife in her outfit. \n\nHe sent it to me this week, saying he thought I\u2019d like to have it, she looked great, etc. I told my wife and she is PISSED. Pissed that he took the photo, pissed that he kept it, pissed that he felt he could send it. \n\nI let him know today I thought he was out of line, and he isn\u2019t engaging. Before I take this another step I\u2019m wondering what people think - AITA?", "created_utc": 1667687441, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yn8hxy/aita_after_wedding_night_drama/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friend sounds like an absolute creep\u2026not only for taking the picture, but keeping it, and then seemingly trying to almost\u2026brag to you that he has it? Good on your for having your wife\u2019s back. Sounds like you\u2019re going to be a great husband.", "NTA - that\u2019s beyond creepy! He had no right to take that picture without her consent. That\u2019s mad disrespectful!", "Your friend crossed a line big time. NTA.", "He sucks the most for taking the picture but I think it's weird to invite any friends to your honeymoon suite especially when you have to get up early and then give gentle hints for people to leave. You're both weird for first inviting them being unable to disinvite.", "You should have skipped the \"dropping hints\" and just outright told them it was time to leave.", "How are you not pissed at your friend? How many people has he shared it with? This is your wife. Did you two handle the situation properly by not just kicking them out....no. What your wife did was a lighthearted get the point now kind of thing. She wasn't expecting it to go any further. What your friend did was a violation in many levels and there is no excuse for it. If I was your wife I would be pissed and have no desire to ever be around him again. Even if he says he deleted how will you ever know. How will you know who else has it. Holy hell man.", "NTA - it\u2019s beyond creepy that he thought it was okay to take a picture of anyone in lingerie without there permission. Not only would I be pissed, I\u2019d be seriously rethinking the friendship", "Whoah. That's like really not cool of him to take her picture. They weren't leaving and yeah she came out in it and they saw her like that but didn't have a right to take a picture of her. It's really obvious that a person wouldn't want to be photographed dressed all sexy WITHOUT their consent, so he totally crossed a boundary. \nI dont know what you mean by \"next step\" but basically the guy needs to apologize for this breach of trust and delete the photo. And your wife may never want to hang out with this person anymore and I wouldn't blame her.", "NTA. Who in their right mind takes a photo of someone in an outfit like that without their permission?? He\u2019s a major AH.", "I\u2019d have to be extraordinarily drunk to not realize a just-married couple would want alone time on their wedding night.", "ESH kinda... the next step after hints not taken would be to say \"it's our wedding night and we have an early flight tomorrow. Why don\u2019t you take it to the hotel bar if you want to keep the party going?\" like you said in the post.\n\nThat being said the major AH move was the picture etc. Absolutely NO right to do that no matter what. Honestly seems like a fun silly tipsy decision on your wife's part which should absolutely never be punished with this weird blackmail type picture.", "NTA- it was your hotel room, your bride is welcome to walk around in or out of whatever she wants, that is not an invitation for other people, not even you, to take pictures of her without her permission. This is creepy that, not only did he feel the need to take it (I\u2019ll blame drunk brain, not as an excuse just for lack of common sense), but that he kept it for 3 weeks before finally sending it to you. If that was seriously his intention, why did it take so long, and who knows who else he is sharing that picture with. If it ends up out on the internet, it will be out there forever. \n\nYou should be pissed!!!!", "NTA. Your friend is so out of line for taking a photo in the first place (although in his drunk mind he probably thought he was being funny). I would ask him to apologise to your wife big time for being a pervert.", "This could have been avoided if you straight up told them it is time to leave. So ESH?", "NTA. Taking the photo, keeping and sending it without consent was a nasty thing to do, particularly in the context of your friends, a wedding and as your guest. Unpleasant sexual undertone to it, as though he thinks he got to your wife first", "NTA he had no right to take that picture", "NTA - this man can't be trusted .  How clueless do they have to be not to have an idea that newlyweds might have 'plans'", "if you are able to, make sure your friend actually deleted that picture. either you or someone trusted watch him delete it and delete it from the delete file/album if his phone has it and probably should make sure he didn't back it up anywhere else. if he's that comfortable taking that picture, intoxicated or not, he's probably not above trying to keep it.", "NTA - holy shit pls tell your wife I am so sorry someone violated her like that. and I am so sorry your friend thought that was okay to do and show you. please cut him out of your life", "ESH because you should have just used your words. She chose to wear that in front of your friends instead of just telling people to leave. Your friend was an asshole for taking a picture", "ESH. You and your wife for not communicating clearly (what were you scared of?) that it was time for your friends to leave. Your wife for parading around in her lingerie, I'm sure that made people uncomfortable. Your friend for taking a photo w/o consent, and sharing it with you and god knows who else.", "NTA and your friend is not your friend and is a complete AH. He had absolutely no right to take that picture and everything after that is just AH sauce.", "NTA\n\nYour friend was totally out of line taking that photo and keeping it.", "Why didn\u2019t the after party happen at the hotel bar to start with?\n\nThat\u2019s what we did. It\u2019s was great \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAlso - congrats on the marriage!\nNTA", "Men can be assertive, but a woman gets called a bitch when she is. She was gone for fifteen minutes and you didn't have the room cleared out in that time?! An inappropriate picture was taken and has been passed around. I can see why your wife is pissed. You are your friend are definitely the assholes here.", "Esh.\n\nInstead of subtle hints you should have opened the door to the hallway and said Goodnight.\n\nWife should not have come out in the nightgown and put on a show.\n\nFriend shouldn't have taken that picture.\n\n\nI won't defend him but he doesn't suck worse than you guys do.", "NTA. He\u2019s out of line. Taking the photo was not cool, but forgivable IMO if he just deletes it. If he tries to be a right fighter and refuses to get rid of it\u2026 well that would say a lot about his true character.", "Yta.  People have phones and cameras it\u2019s reality deal with it.   You and your wife would have been better to take control of the situation and move people out of the room.   or accepting reality., not invite them there.  Obviously, they weren\u2019t gonna leave.", "NTA. Smart phones have given us the ability to capture every moment as it happens but unfortunately many Woolley have figured out that every moment shouldn\u2019t be captured. Your friend is obviously one of those people. You were justified in telling him he crossed a line. \n\nI might get downvoted for saying this but here it  goes: I think what your wife did to get your friends to leave was inappropriate and immature. You guys are adults. If you wanted your friends to leave, you directly ask them to leave. You don\u2019t \u201cdrop hints\u201d. When you blur boundary lines like that, you make people like your friend think that all social etiquette has gone out the window. I\u2019m not saying that your wife is to blame for what your friend did. I\u2019m just saying that this could have been avoided had one of you just asked your friends to leave.", "NTA\n\nYour now former friend is a creeper and needs to be compelled to delete that photo. Depending on what state you're in, it could be considered revenge porn and he could face charges.", "NTA", "ESH it was a bad call inviting anyone up to your suite on your wedding night if you couldn't assert yourself when it was time to leave", "What the actual fuck?! This is a crime, I believe- if not everywhere then some places. He is NOT a friend and should be dropped immediately. He violated your wife. How you treat this will stay with her forever. \n\nNTA if you drop him.", "Under a certain light, could this be considered revenge porn? Sure, the friend is not spreading something for being dumped, but it sounds like he may have done it to get back at your wife for kicking him out. Even if not in anger, as a way of saying, \"Haha, this is why you don't show up in your underwear to make a point.\" Either way, NTA, although the fact that you weren't pissed until your wife got pissed almost pushed me to say E-S-H (except for your wife, obviously).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do think it depends on intent and on how the friend group interacts.", "Uh... no, he is a creep for taking the picture too.", "Yes, we realize that we brought on the situation.", "Thanks, wise words.", "Thanks! Yes at the time it was fun.

I don\u2019t think a court would find a woman just standing in lingerie to be sexually explicit. If that were the case prime time tv shows wouldn\u2019t be allowed to show female characters in lingerie. I do agree with you that this incident stems from the same idea that revenge porn comes form.", "Huh?", "They...said he was a creep for taking the picture", "He had fifteen minutes to get the guests out. That is a lot of time to get guests out of a hotel room. I didn't fault him for the picture, but it wouldn't have been taken if had told the guests to leave when the wife went to the bathroom."]}
