If you're a PA, your job is answering emails and organising his calendar, not weighing in on his creative decisions, moving equipment from where he wants it or telling the actors how to perform", "This has to be a joke. Of course YTA. Stay in your lane.", "YTA. Your job is to assist the director to execute his vision. Your job is not to make your own creative decisions or to give him advice. Your job is *certainly* not to give the actors direction. You are literally the least important person on the set and your opinion carries no weight. That\u2019s what a PA job is. \n\nYou acted like an ass and delayed production so a natural consequence of that is the director yelling at you. You are the one who owes him an apology, not the other way around. He\u2019s already being kinder than he needs to be by giving you the opportunity to apologize and come back to work; a lot of people wouldn\u2019t bother.

You\u2019re there to run errands, follow directions, and help out in any way that the director needs. Hopefully you use that time to learn about filmmaking from someone who\u2019s been doing it for a much longer time than you. You\u2019re also TA for damaging your mom\u2019s reputation by coming off as entitled and actively disrupting this production.", "YTA, and if you have any actual interest in working in this field you need to immediately pull your head out of your ass.

You don\u2019t move equipment without being told to, you\u2019re wasting their time and money interfering with the setup. \n\nYou REALLY don\u2019t give notes unrequested to an actor. That\u2019s incredibly disrespectful even from their peers. Notes come from the director, because they\u2019re the boss. You\u2019re not their boss. You\u2019re not their peer. As a PA, you are at most their flunky. \n\nAnd as a final touch, you\u2019re a major asshole for trying to weaponize \u201cI feel UNSAFE\u201d because the person whose shoot you fucked told you you fucked up his shoot. He doesn\u2019t owe you an apology for your fucking up, and you\u2019re not a delicate flower who is imperilled by naughty language. You\u2019re a presumptuous employee who just tantrumed your way out of a job, probably did your mom professional harm, and apparently have learned nothing since you keep interjecting about how they were just making you run errands, so obviously you had to assert your authority.

Clearly you\u2019re an inexperienced or completely shit PA if you don\u2019t know/care that kind of behaviour will get you fired immediately from any set. On top of that, you think you have the right to tell the director how to do their job!? YTA, not only for your astonishing entitlement, but for complete lack of understanding of what your job actually is. You\u2019re lucky you were only sworn at by the director, if any real camera guy ever caught you touching their equipment I can\u2019t even imagine what they would do.  Source\u2014have worked in film for 14 years, some of that as an actual PA both on set and in office.  My mind is BLOWN that you moved a camera holy shit. Do not fuck with transport, and do NOT FUCK WITH CAMERA.", "YTA. You definitely overstepped. Does being a PA include advising, criticizing, or giving an opinion on your boss\u2019s commercial? Obviously not, so you should apologize and keep your criticisms to yourself. If his commercial flops, it flops \u2014 and that\u2019ll be on him, not you.", "YTA. How old are you that you're going back and crying to your mommy?", "A PA giving a director unsolicited creative advice is a massive faux pas. YTA.", "YTA - Writing the script is not your job. Positioning the cameras differently than the director wants them is not your job. And the director knows what the client wants better than you do.", "YTA\n\nYour job is to assist the director, not to interfere with his work. If he makes a mistake, so be it, but it not your job to fix it for him. \n\nYou don\u2019t know everything yet.

Let him make mistakes, collect your pay cheque and move on. \n\nThis is what the industry is like and unless it\u2019s your production, it\u2019s not your call.", "Yta you're the PA, not his boss.  It literally isn't your job to tell the producer that you *personally*  don't like his film.", "You weren't trying to do your job. You were trying to push your ideas onto someone who 1 didn't ask and 2 said no. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. You weren\u2019t trying to do your job. Your job was to go to Costco. You were trying to do HIS job. You arrogantly overstepped in an industry where people bend over backwards to get the position you had. His movie, his commercial, his career on the line, his rules. I doubt you\u2019ll be allowed back at this point, with or without an apology, but you should apologize to both the director and your mother. To him for being an arrogant know-nothing and to your mom for wasting the favor she called in to get you hired. That\u2019s really embarrassing in a professional setting.", "Yta", "He's 'like 60' and someone who gets hired to shoot a commercial for a national audience, but because *you're young* you have more expertise than he does?

He's been doing this longer than you've been alive. Old does not mean out of touch, and young does not mean clued in. YTA. Wow. Apologize. To everyone. Including the actors.", "YTA. If it was  ethics, it would be different. Observe since this is likely your first job, you basically have no credibility, particularly since you got the job from your mother's referral. You also don't know this director that well. Nothing is wrong with having an opinion but hold it in.\n\nAnd from his perspective, a new hire with no real experience just told him how to do his job and he doesn't even have anything to back him up, just gut feel. More than that, he is interfering with the work being done and is bow more of a liability than asset, making his life harder.\n\nApologize and let him do it his way. Perhaps he is wrong, it is not you who is taking responsibility for the project. It is him with his reputation on the line.", "YTA, you're the PA he's the director. Your job is not to move the cameras or direct the actors and if you keep doing it you'll be out and you won't get another shot elsewhere (word travels fast with filmmakers).\n\nIf you don't like what he's doing you're free to start making your own films/ads that are more to your taste outside of your working hours but as the PA you zip it, get on with your job, and silently roll your eyes where you can't be seen doing so if you really must judge.\n\nBetter yet, stop judging and watch/learn everything you can. It's valuable experience!", "You are a PA. Personal Assistant. As in you assist him in whatever he needs. He needs coffee? You go get it. He needs a donut? You go get it. He needs his agenda checked?

Sure not cool on his part, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to just make changes.\n\nYou probably don\u2019t have a career in film production after this.", "As someone who has been working in the industry since I was 17 YTA and you\u2019re never getting hired again by ANYONE on that crew. You CANNOT move cameras without permission, if it\u2019s union it\u2019s \u201cillegal\u201d to interfere with their work. And if you\u2019re a PA - I doubt you\u2019re in the room with creative when they discuss what they\u2019re doing. If they had asked you for your opinion that\u2019s valid, but you got hired to do a job and you just made everyone\u2019s life harder, wasted time and money and sound like a nightmare to work with. If someone contacted me about what it was like to work with you after experiencing that I would flat out tell them all this and they wouldn\u2019t hire you.
