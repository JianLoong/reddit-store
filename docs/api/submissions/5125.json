On film sets, time is money to the nth degree. It is eye-wateringly expensive to have all of those people and their equipment in one place at one time, it's the priciest part of the whole process, especially on indies.\n\nFurthermore, the director, DOP etc have likely spent many hours planning the shoot to within an inch of its life, where the cameras will be, tweaking dialogue, rehearsing actors and the rest. A live set is the worst place for unsolicited creative notes or unplanned changes, least of all from the most junior person there (in this case, OP). It does happen, but it's the prerogative of director or producer, and any changes are carefully weighed against time and budget.\n\nAll this to say, there would have been no appropriate time on set for OP to do/say as they did, it was way of out line. \n\nIf OP wanted to give input via a hypothetical discussion in the office before the shoot? MAYBE, but even then you've got a green AF assistant criticising and offering notes on the work of a team of experienced professionals, so OP would have to be very tactful for that to go over without, at best being laughed at, or at worst getting chewed out. And judging by the original post I don't think tact is their strong suit. \n\nIt takes years of fundraising, writing, planning and careful logistics management to get any film made. OP clearly has no understanding or respect for that fact because they thought they could just swan into the director's shoots and claim they know better than all of the industry professionals who have put time and money behind his creative vision for them. \n\nNot your money, not your creation, not your business.

There is simply no way you can tell anything about this movie based on how some B-roll was shot; it's such a small part of the movie, and it's going to look so different after it's been edited and music has been added, you see it in context, etc. And even though you're seeing more of the commercial, it's also going to look radically different by the time it goes up on Youtube.

Chain of command sucks but it\u2019s there for a reason. \n\nWhat you did to the set was disrespectful and fireable on many, many sets. There\u2019s more money at stake than some of us will ever see on these national projects. If you want to be invited back, I would fall in line. When I worked in post, I saw every tape from an $80k shoot be thrown out because a makeup artist felt ambitious and added a color which no one noticed until way too late, and then we had to call writers in, then add two new sequences to replace the ruined one, since there was no way we could afford to reshoot but it still cost us another three days of smaller shoots. Other shoots have been ruined similarly with the SMALLEST things\u2014 it takes one person to flush a budget.

You\u2019re too young to know what you don\u2019t know, and you don\u2019t have the kind of financial responsibilities that make you get serious about your career. The next 15 years will give you a bunch of reality checks, and you will settle down too. \n\nThis is the way of the world. Writers were talking about the younger generation destroying everything 1,000 years ago. It\u2019s just the age. And it\u2019s all part of a healthy ecosystem. The older generations have the wisdom that comes from seeing many ideas fail over the years. It\u2019s a good thing: they can say, \u201cWe already tried this, and this is why it didn\u2019t work.\u201d But they can also get set in their ways and be resistant to any change at all. Younger generations have spark and energy to change things. They confront the problems the rest of us long ago accepted and try to change them. It\u2019s a good thing: it clears prejudice and makes way for innovation. But young people can also be totally blind to their own ignorance and not see the whole picture. The tension between these groups isn\u2019t comfortable, but it\u2019s healthy. \n\nAnd you are right that it\u2019s not all Gen Z. A lot of younger people strike the right balance between pushing boundaries and seeing the value of the status quo. It\u2019s the more pigheaded of your set who go too far and make the rest of you look bad. Just like it\u2019s not all boomers: my retired boomer parents are far more progressive than they were as 30 year olds. \n\nBut despite the way people talk, it\u2019s not a critical failing of your generation.

The problem it's twofold. First, she clearly approached this wrong. Second, right or wrong nobody was gonna listen to her because she hasn't \"paid her dues.\" I get the annoyance, but the correct move for the director was to ask get why she thinks what she does, and then if she doesn't know what she's talking about to help educate her.

One thing the US military does better than just about anyone is always training the next guy for the job, add that's what this director should have done.
