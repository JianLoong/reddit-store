Your job was to run errands without complaint, but you couldn\u2019t help but interfere with what the professionals were doing.  You\u2019ve got two eyes and two ears, but only one mouth - this should tell you something about which you should be using.", "Omg NO no you literally cannot comment. Your job is to do as you\u2019re told, not let producers catch you sitting around, ONLY speak on the walkie when YOU are spoken to, make sure you have hot bricks for the crew and go stand on lock up when you\u2019re told to. You should NOT be speaking to the actors or really director at all and you should NEVER touch another departments equipment. Im so confused as to what your expectation was? Why would you think it\u2019s OK to tell veterans of the industry what to do when you have zero experience? \n\nI was a PA for all my early 20s and I\u2019m mortified for you.", "You already made your suggestion at the beginning, and he wasn't interested. That's it. He's the boss. Case closed.\n\nThat was already a risky move for you, and based on your post I worry you lack the tact to have done that effectively and not insultingly. But that part was, *maybe* okay, if you made a suggestion ONCE in a completely nonjudgmental noninsulting way where you made clear you respected and admired their skill and authority and were honored to share your idea with them.\n\nBut now they said no. So you . . . started undermining your boss? Moving cameras and giving direction to actors? That's literally sabtoging your boss's job. Stop sabtoging your bosses's job.\n\nIs this real? Can you be this oblivious? YTA if you're real.", "What do you think a PA does?", "No. Your job is to be helpful and watch and learn. You\u2019re way out of bounds here. Go grovel or you\u2019ll never work again. Do you know how many people want to break into film? Watch and learn. Don\u2019t ever correct peoples artistic choices. You have a long way to go. Check your ego.", "In the short term, that's your job. Not anything else. You don't need to assert yourself to try and take other people's jobs. Do yours instead.\n\nIn the long term, PAing when you want to do more means being effective and likable to help make connections for more PA jobs and for later in your career. And watching how other professsionals work on set. Which asserting yourself will do the opposite of helping with.", "PA is absolutely getting coffee and Costco trips. That is literally the job. I\u2019ve worked as a PA on many types of projects - sometimes I\u2019ve spent hours pulling stickers off of items to go in grab bags and sometimes I\u2019ve been doing coffee runs. I\u2019ve spent 8 hour days going from green center to garden center searching for the \u201cright\u201d plant. It\u2019s not that serious.

Jesus.", "Holy fuck you are not going to make it in that industry...", "No you can\u2019t. I am a director. And absolutely no you can\u2019t. It is his shoot, realising his vision. If you want to direct set up your own shoot. You are also more than likely wrong about his shot choices. Because he\u2019s a professional with years of experience and skill and you are not. You can\u2019t see his vision because you are not the director. You have no idea what the final outcome will be like after editing, grading etc etc. Noting an actor is bad enough. That\u2019s a huge skill and should be done with care. Bad notes destabilise actors, their performance and their choices within that role and across the shoot as a whole. They have to trust the director. That relationship is delicate and you undermined the director on the set. And by the way saying \u2018slowing down might have more impact\u2019 is a bad note: why does slowing down have impact? Which part of the line? How does that reflect the overall character? What impact is the director trying to achieve? How does this section fit in the overall story? Perhaps pace is needed here to earn a payoff in the next scene? Who knows. But then actually moving a set up?! Presumably with the DOP/ LX department all there. Hell no. You undermined the whole crews\u2019 positions. Directing isn\u2019t just saying \u2018film that\u2019 it\u2019s also running a shoot, creating faith within the team and having a vision of the final outcome. It sounds like he knows how to create a team because he banned you from it.", "It means exactly that. \n\nYou aren\u2019t someone that gets to argue with the director about creative. Those jobs exist. That\u2019s not you.", "\"Personal Assistant\" means doing the personal errands of the person you work for. It's a nicely phrased way to say \"gofer\" or \"you're being paid to do the annoying boring tasks\" \n\nIt sucks, but that's the job and if you can't stand being the errand person and keeping your head down then that's not the position for you. \n\nIf you want your creative opinions to be valued you can't do it on someone else's dime. Love or hate his decisions, the director earned his position and earned the right to say \"I'm gonna do it this way\" \n\nYou haven't yet, you will with time possibly (depending), but right now what do you have to show your decisions are the right ones? What portfolio do you have that you understand saying \"it will be more impactful this way\" will actually come out that way on screen? \n\nIt's not just you and your opinions, it's a crew of people with their own specific jobs, and the people paying already have the guy they decided they like his portfolio. They trust when he says \"I think it will look like this\", and to get it to look the way he said it would look means doing things according to the director, not the untested young adult on their first set.", "Who does that stuff if not the PA? You\u2019re low rung on the totem pole bud. \n\nIt sounds like you didn\u2019t have a clear idea of what your role actually was - it\u2019s not creative, you don\u2019t get to have a voice on content (unless specifically asked and that never really happens), and it IS mostly the boring stuff. You just blew a great networking opportunity and the chance to have great references.", "Yes, it does. Your job title is personal assistant. That means you assist in menial tasks that your boss doesn\u2019t want or have time to do. You will not be in this industry for long if you don\u2019t pull your head out of your ass and have some humility.", "You run errands and frankly sound entitled.", "You are being paid to be a minion.

And no, you have absolutely NO WEIGHT behind yourself to assert anything.", "No. You stay quiet, learn, and do your job.", "Yeah it absolutely does. PA is personal assistant right? As in helping them with their errands and other small tasks? That is literally what you were hired for. What on earth makes you think that gives you the authority to change how their commercial is being produced?? \nThe gall of some people jfc", "If they want your input, they\u2019ll ask. They didn\u2019t ask. Mind your business and do your job, if you still have one.", "You're a PA. you don't GET to \"Assert Yourself\" unless someone is doing something inappropriate or you're being abused somehow. You do what you're *told*, or you quit.", "OP I hate to break it to you but that's all a personal assistant does. You made an incorrect assumption on what the job entailed, you overstepped it, you apologise or walk away from this line of work if you don't want to be doing menial tasks. You don't have production experience, you are starting at the absolute bottom and it'll take time to earn experience.", "And how did that go for you? Grow up.", "PA does in fact mean trips to various stores and coffee shops. PA stands for personal assistant, you're job is to assist the person who is your boss, however they define assistance. If he ASKS for advice then of course you give it, if he doesn't though you keep quiet and let him fail", "A PA goes to Costco, get coffee, schedules Dr appointments, picks up dry cleaning, and does what ever menial task you are asked to do. There is asserting yourself (asking to do extra tasks like clean something or organize something so they can see you care and want to do more) and there is sticking your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong and creating a headache for everyone else. You are the person who gets coffee not a creative director. Do excellent at what you are tasked to do and eventually someone may ask your opinion. YTA", "No, you didn't have to assert yourself.\n\nYour job was going to Costco and getting his coffee.  You over stepped your duties, and frankly come across as someone who thinks they are more important to the project than you are.  I get you are wanting to move forward in this industry, but they way you are going about it is likely to backfire spectacularly.", "That's EXACTLY what being a PA means. You do what will make his job easier. \nDid you really think you were going to come on set and win an award for your groundbreaking perspective?!?! \nYou won't have a future in this industry if you can't do the job you were hired for. \nOnce you've built up a reputation then you may be asked for more input and given more tasks. \nBe thankful for the experience you are getting, listen and learn from those around you. \n\nYTA, apologize and do better. \nIt doesn't matter if the commercial and indie film tank, it's not on you.", "It actually does. You\u2019re basically a personal assistant, that is the job. Don\u2019t overestimate your importance, especially since you only got the job because your mommy got it for you.", "Yes it absolutely DOES mean that...That's the literal definition - you assist on basic tasks as requested, and in return get to observe and learn a little, meet some people, make a good impression. Did you somehow think it was code for 'I'm now the main character of this production'? YTA.", "Dude that is EXACTLY what a PA's job is...lolol. Wow. You really need to learn the hierarchy and roles required for an on-set production if you think you're capable of working on one.", "You \u201casserted yourself\u201d right out of a job.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t think that word means what you think it means.\n\nYTA", "Being his PA means getting him food and his coffee, yes. Wtf.\n\nYTA. Not an assitant director.", "That\u2019s what it feels like. Make yourself the victim. It\u2019s funny because it\u2019s almost like a reflex to say that whilst at no time saying what it was that made her so feel unsafe it\u2019s just thrown in there with no context. Lol", "The job she describes by her tasks sounds more like a personal assistant position", "Then that needs to be clarified since the main usage of PA is personal assitant.", "Shit. I missed that. Yeah her career in entertainment is over before it started.", "You just never know what the directors vision is and have to trust the process.  It is all a learning process, especially if you want to be a director.  People are always bold and think they know it all when it isn't their money or paycheck on the line.  \n\nYes, the OP can save up or raise the money needed for his own projects and see how well it all turns out.", "I wasn't sure if they were a personal assistant or a general production assistant. I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt about why they thought they could be in charge. Apologies.", "I run into this problem all the time at work. Im in shipping and logistics for our company. I have been doing this job for 13 years and with the company 20 total. I also am not college educated. I kind of am but stopped going with about a year left to go. \n\nEverytime we get new people especially college graduates in comes all the suggestions and recommendations. I actually don't mind people saying giving ideas to make things better. What I have the issue with is the attitude you get after you decline said idea. I kind of know what I'm doing. I regularly am getting offers by competitors and I have a strong reputation in the industry.  They actually nicknamed me jesus since I make miracles happen. \n\nId recommend if your in Op situation keep your suggestions to yourself unless its something you feel super strongly in. Also do not get bummed if they don't go with your idea. Also read the room and don't over advise. Knowledge is useless without the wisdom to apply it.", "That\u2019s my thing. I totally don\u2019t want to sound like a boomer. I\u2019m technically a Millennial by some metrics. But advocating for yourself and self promotion can easily turn into annoying and counterproductive to your future growth if you don\u2019t strike the right balance. It\u2019s a skill you have to grow into, too. At this stage it\u2019s more about hiding all the things you *dont* know and asking questions. No one expect you to know shit, but they don\u2019t want you to make their job harder by cleaning up your messes. \n\nAnd it is by no means a new phenomenon - I have had coworkers my age fail early for the exact same reason - but this is my second anecdotal experience in less than 1 week, so it strikes a chord with me. Because the junior in question is very good for his experience level, but he\u2019s not experienced. And I kindda felt bad that he had already started off on the wrong foot with his boss. I felt compelled to keep him quiet so he wouldn\u2019t be on thinner ice.", "Yeah I was too broadly sweeping there. But generally I think y\u2019all are bad ass and have more energy and desire to good than some previously generations combined. But y\u2019all still work with boomers and people who came up under them, so there are gonna be some growing pains as you get dealt to take over :)", "Right? Has OP never looked up what a PA is??? I'm baffled that they think that's okay behavior.", "\u201cPA\u201d in the context of film generally means \u201cproduction assistant\u201d not \u201cpersonal assistant\u201d but the responsibilities are mostly the same, you just are working for the general production rather than a specific person", "Yeah, OP is going to fail at every job with that attitude.", ">Having said that, I don't think is fair from him to yell at you, that's not way of treating an employee.\n\nI hear you, that's absolutely true.

All these people attached to their phone can't bother to Google what a PA does.", "I figured it meant project assistant since PM is often project manager.", "Ah, my bad. thanks.   \nStill that sounds like \"gofer, but for everyone on set instead of one person\"", "her sense of entitlement is out of this universe.", "The instances she described sounded like it happened on different days too so she got chance after chance to redeem herself after being told no, and to knock it off but she refused.
