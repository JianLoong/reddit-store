I\u2019ve bought them every year but this year I can\u2019t. My hours got cut from 40 to 15 and I\u2019m struggling a lot while job searching.\n\nOn my way to an interview this afternoon, I opened the door right before they knocked. If this was last year then that would\u2019ve been perfect timing because I love shortbread. Turns out they were selling Yankee candles for a school fundraiser and the girl was just still in uniform. I declined bc I can\u2019t spare $10 on a candle. \n\nThe mom made some weird comments about this being an affluent neighborhood (it\u2019s not, and I\u2019m renting) so surely I could spare 10 bucks. I didn\u2019t do the best job of hiding my face but I said no thanks again and wished them well with my neighbors. It was awkward so I closed the door even though I needed to leave. I never participated in school fundraisers but we weren\u2019t allowed to do door to door. Anyway- She put her foot in the door and basically demanded I buy something. \n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to go to jail today so it took everything in me to keep calm. She pushed the whole \u201cIt\u2019s just $15\u201d thing and I asked her to move her foot. After some back and forth she did, but they stayed outside. I grabbed something from my room and came back expecting them to be gone but when I looked through my peephole she was still there talking about how sales benefit XYZ school. I asked through the door for her to leave. She didn\u2019t like that and just started knocking like crazy as if I weren\u2019t already standing there. \n\nI felt bad but after about 2 minutes I called the cops for harassment because I have a bad temper and knew I would make it worse. You\u2019d think she would\u2019ve left but nope. I felt super Karen-ish but it was ridiculous and I had somewhere to be. I was scared I\u2019d be late bc I needed to stop for gas (and could only spare $10, funny enough). \n\nI waited about 10 mins for the cop and when he arrived I opened the door. The mom went off on me and complained that I was going too far on someone just trying to fundraise. I, calmly as I could, told her she was harassing me atp. She argued with the cop but did what he said while calling me all kinds of names for \u201cgoing too far.\u201d I felt bad but what was I supposed to do \n\nI\u2019ve been living off Campbell\u2019s soup and beans lately so $10 on a candle wasn\u2019t gonna happen. I\u2019ve got $13 left. Either way, I said no. I\u2019ve got a crazy UTI right now so not only am I hungry but I can\u2019t afford my copay, the meds, and am running low on dog food. She was so entitled in my opinion and I feel like maybe the cops was a stretch but what else could I have done knowing I\u2019ve got a temper? \n\nGood news tho- I got the job.

I just have a hard time imagining that quick police response, even in my own fairly upscale neighborhood.", "I mean, police response is so variable. I live in a big city, with generally bad police response times and we don't live in a great neighborhood (not bad, but not posh either). BUT we're 2 minutes from the local police substation, and on a regular patrol route. Our response time here has been under 5 minutes for me and my neighbors on several occasions for minor things.", "In my area, ten minutes would have been over estimating. You can go from the police headquarters to anywhere in town within 4 minutes with normal traffic. Yes, we are big enough to have a Walmart nearby. We also have state police on constant patrol around the county. They have always shown up within minutes of any emergency in my neighborhood. So, it's probably a timeline relative to each area."]}
