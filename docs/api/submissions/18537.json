Because frankly, I, too, find it extremely creepy that as the only male in the class, you sit silently in the back and keep your face covered. At best it seems stalkerish.\n\nIn today's society, it is unusual for an individual to prefer to keep his face hidden without some ulterior motive for doing so.  It's your choice: continue wearing the hoodies and frightening your classmates; come clean with them about your motives; or stop with the hoodies and let your face be seen.", "NTA. Oh the irony of being policed on what you wear. I\u2019m sure you can find a fun argument.", "NAH. I do highly recommend you seek therapy. Try a face mask and/or a baseball cap. It covers as much of your face if not more and doesn\u2019t give off ominous vibes as much as the hoodie does. If you continue to wear the hoodie, it\u2019s within your rights, but honestly it\u2019ll just keep drawing more attention to yourself which seems to be what you\u2019re trying to avoid. Good luck with everything man.", "I'm going to have to settle on NAH.\n\nThe other commentors are right, you are absolutely within your rights to dress any way you want as long as you're not breaking the law or say, campus rules.\nYou're not an asshole for that.\n\nHowever, as unfair as it feels, people will judge us based on our demeanor and appearance, and something in your presence in the class reads as \"threatening\" to others. If you're neurodivergent, you're probably especially aware of how quickly and unfairly people judge you based on any ND traits (like stimming/twitchiness, monotone voice, flat expressions etc). It's unfair that the burden is placed on us, but masking is a survival tactic for a reason.\nSometimes adjusting your behavior is the path of least resistance.\n\nAlso assuming you're based in USA, I can't help but make conclusions about fears around school shooters. Gender studies are looked down upon by the incel type who have been responsible for multiple spree shootings in the past decade.\n\nThose fears are misplaced, but there's no doubt an atmosphere of hypervigilance currently. I don't live in the US so worrying about shootings has never been something I'm aware of. When I go to school or a nightclub, I don't have to worry about someone shooting the place up.\nI can't even imagine existing in that kind of reality.\n\nAs an outsider looking in, there is collective trauma in society when mass shootings are somewhat of a norm and that will have effects on the people living in that society. That will breed paranoia and fear.\n\nYou are not to blame for that, but I think it's reasonable to consider whether you can have a proper discussion with your teacher again, or if there are any compromises you can make to benefit your own situation if the hoodie issue keeps coming up.", "NTA BUT \u2026what\u2019s ironic is that I\u2019m juxtaposing how women feel when they dress casually, nicely, comfortably etc. in a science or engineering class and someone asks her to please dress in a hoodie and sweatpants because she\u2019s distracting the guys because something-something cleavage.  \n\nHowever, if you are a guy, covering your face and being antisocial in the back of a gender studies class is a huge red flag.  At this point you are living the discrepancy between how women often find safety in a group by making eye contact and watching other\u2019s body language and how you want a right to disengage and remain private.  Sadly, it is a stereotype that the guy not making connections with others and keeping to himself alone in the back is taking the class to find a victim or maybe one day do something awful to the class in a burst of incel rage.  You\u2019ve made no attempt to clarify you\u2019re an ally.  It seems you\u2019ve learned nothing from the gender studies class if this is a surprise to you.", "It feels like you\u2019re leaving something out. Like you\u2019re wearing a hoodie in a way that obscures your identity so you look like you\u2019re about to rob a convenience store. \n\nInfo: Are you wearing a hoodie up over your head? Is there an inappropriate or controversial image on the hoodie?", "NTA, fuck \u2018em and report that shit", "Okay so you're not an asshole for wearing your hoodie and being quiet in the back of the class. As an introvert with self-image struggles, I completely get that desire to be as invisible as possible, and unless there's a dress code at your college about hoods in class, then you're completely within your rights to attend your classes just as you've described.\n\nHowever, there are several factors that will be contributing to your classmates discomfort. These factors are not your fault, but they are unfortunate realities of the world we live in. I think it's great that you are taking a gender studies class, and I think more men should, but unfortunately, it really isn't common for men to take those types of courses currently, so if there's one guy in the whole class and he avoids interaction and hides his face, there are going to be questions raised in your classmates' minds about his intentions. Is he stalking someone in the class? Is he an incel who might harass us? Is he a radical misogynist who hates women and is planning to hurt one or more of us? Is he choosing someone to follow home? Is he planning a mass shooting and he thinks this class of women will be a soft target? \n\nTo reiterate, none of these thought processes are your fault, and based on your post I don't believe that your intentions are anything other than getting your credits to graduate. But women are hyper-aware of the types of threats that I described above. Pretty much every woman has either experienced that type of behaviour or personally knows one who has. It's the stuff that's in the news all the time (at least in America where I'm assuming this is taking place due to the language you use in the post), not just for women but for everyone, with school shootings happening every day. \n\nSo no, you're NTA, but unfortunately the world we live in can be dangerous for women and we are used to being on high alert for potential threats, so a solo guy who hides his face and avoids interaction in a room full of women is going to be ringing alarm bells in many of your classmates' minds. By all means keep wearing your hoodie and going to class in the way you currently do - it's your choice and that shouldn't be taken away from you. But just be aware of what that unintentionally signals to the women around you and that they may continue to be nervous and raise this with the lecturer again.", "NTA just be honest about why you wear it that way. It\u2019s your body and it isn\u2019t offence or inappropriate", "NTA Tell them \"I am who I am, please stop harassing me because you don't like my outfit.\"", "Wearing a hoodie in and of itself isn't creepy, if you are wearing it with the hood up it can give the impression that you are trying to hide your identity. Hiding your identity gives off stalker-type vibes.", "NTA but a med mask would be more incognito", "So from reading the comments and based on the votes: \n\nHoodie bad, many downvotes\n\nFace mask good, many upvotes \n\nI am not sure how so many people would be more comfortable with him wearing a hat and face mask rather than his hoodie.", "NTA - I feel like this a perfect dialogue for a gender studies class, and I would write an email to the professor asking how one dresses and the perceptions that dressing certain ways in social situations affect others and how and when it is appropriate to tell people how to dress based on gender. See what the profs response is. And maybe say it would be an interesting conversation for class or an essay topic.", "It feels pretty unfair to you. NTA. I'd be questioning if the other students would feel threatened by a person wearing a burka. Or a face mask. Why are they so afraid of a person wearing a hoodie? Just because you're a man? If there's nothing offensive or violent printed on it, and all you are doing is attending a university course you've paid for, I'd be pretty offended by the way they are treating you. It's a gender-studies course, for goodness sake, why isn't the teacher using this as a topic for discussion if it's so obviously causing issues in class? Why are other students so afraid of a male person wearing a very common item of clothing to class? What assumptions are they making and why, etc. Would they be treating a female wearing a hoodie the same way? Is a fellow student being a little shy or quiet a reason for fear and confrontation? Sounds like a pretty hostile environment towards you.", "Gonna go out on a limb and say YTA. I'm picking up on some potential neurodivergence here, so I'm trying to be understanding, but try to see it from their perspective. Have you heard the song \"Sunglasses at Night\"? That's kind of like what you're doing. You can see them, but they can't see your expression. It makes them feel like you're spying on them.\n\nI'm curious. Why are you in this class, if it makes you uncomfortable? Are you genuinely interested in the material, or is it a requirement? I think if you open up more and engage with the other students, you'll get more out of it.", "NTA. You are a student in the class and have the right to dress how you feel comfortable. Though it is curious why you feel the need to cover yourself the teacher should have told the complainers you are in the class and have the right to be there.", "NTA because no one has the right to police your attire and a gender studies class dominated by female presenting individuals should understand that more than anyone. \n\nHowever, would you feel comfortable explaining yourself in a class chat? I think you\u2019ll get some sympathy and empathy if you just explain that you struggle to feel comfortable with your face on display, especially when you\u2019re the only person who looks like you in a situation. Say something like \u201cI thought a gender study course of all populations would be the ones to understand this the most and I hope that you will still accept me in class with grace without ostracizing me for being the minority.\u201d", "NTA", "Being shy and having low self esteem doesn't make him a stalker, nor does wearing a hoodie. If they felt something was odd, they should have spoken to him politely, at which point he could have explained, actually I don't like my face which is why I hide it. I lived in hoodies for years due to severe body dysmorphia and low self esteem, which is why I understand his behaviour. But harassing someone for being quiet and wearing a hoodie is wrong. I agree his comfort is not more important than others, but he didn't do anything to make them uncomfortable, they just judged him and then instead of voicing concern politely she aggressively tells him off. Discomfort doesn't give someone excuse to be a bully.", "NTA.  This a perfect teachable moment.  Your classmates and professor are trying to make you fit into their idea of gender norms and that is wrong.  They need to change their focus on trying to change you and work on changing their outlook and gender expectations.  Ask to address this issue at your next class and explain why you wear a hoodie and how it makes you feel more comfortable.  Best of luck!", "NTA\n\nI can kind of understand being unsettled by someone silently sitting in the back of the room with the hood pulled down over their face - at first. But at this point they know who you are and that you belong in this class just as much as they do.  So they've decided that your clothes are threatening? Or they're acting in reaction to a stereotype about people who wear hoodies? \n\nHonestly, you should write an email to your professor outlining how this is impacting your comfort with participating in class. It seems like a very appropriate conversation for a gender studies classroom.", "The expression comes to mind \"if you see something, say something\"\nIt sounds like that's what the ladies are doing.

Go to the department head.  You are being treated in a manner that is making you uncomfortable.  the student shouldn\u2019t have approached you.

A male professor in an engineering class telling the only woman what to wear and that the men were not comfortable around her.

Everyone would say \u201cdon\u2019t you dare tell her what to wear\u201d, etc.\nAsk what is the dress code for the class, check the policies and if you\u2019re within the policies (which I\u2019m guessing you are, can\u2019t imagining it saying anything about hoodies) then you\u2019re fine. Tell your professor or any person who asks that you\u2019re dressed according to code and if they have a complaint to take it up to the university to change the code. Pfff how dare they? Seriously.", "NTA and you would think in a gender studies class, they'd somehow know better than to police someone's attire. If they don't like what you are wearing, they can look away.

You should do online classes so no one has to feel uncomfortable in a class they paid a lot to go to.", "NTA, wear what you're comfortable in if they feel unsafe that's on them.

NTA easily. and it feels like people on here are fishing for a reason to hate. you based off what OP tells you and make ur judgement.", "Well that's fuckin creepy. The professor telling you what to wear, not you wearing *incredibly normal clothes* to class.\n\nAlso the irony? Gender studies professor thinks it's acceptable to police people's clothing based on their sex? Tells them the people of the opposite sex feel uncomfortable? How gross. You're there to learn, and unless it's a fashion school, criticizing student's clothing is unacceptable.\n\nNTA, but it sounds like you're going to keep getting shit for it. Try to talk to the professor and get her to see the hypocrisy in telling people what to wear based on their sex and the opinions of the opposite sex. (Edit: don't attack her! Tell her you feel like you're being singled out as one of the only men in the class and make it clear you feel you're being unjustly treated!) And honestly if she keeps it up? I'd escalate.

The fact of the matter is criminals , especially crimes against women, the perpetrator covers their face. Women have been conditioned for centuries to be hypervigilint. Is this your problem or fault? No. However you're now presented with choices going forward. Continue wearing the hoodie, and the attention will be constantly on you which you say you want to avoid. Stop wearing them and they will hopefully just ignore you, and you'll have to be uncomfortable.  Or drop the class in protest and lay a complaint with the college. \n\nIs any of it fair? No. You are not in the wrong for wearing a hoodie. It's not right that you're being profiled but this has become a situation of \"not all men\" for the girls in the class. You know you're not a predator but conditioning and past bad experiences have now put the girls in the position of they don't know if you are a predator or not, but the behaviour they've been presented with has flagged you as a potential one.\n\nI hope you update us with your choice.

Then conflict could be avoided. \n\nNo, one is telling anyone what to wear. OP just thinks he's entitled to his own comfort, over everyone else's. OP didn't even try to accommodate others. AH", "Weird people have the right to exist in this world. Full stop.", "He\u2019s literally just trying to participate in class. If this were a class full of men and a woman wore short skirts and extreme cleavage everyday, the same argument could be made that the men were getting unintentionally aroused and thus made to be uncomfortable. Everyone would be up in arms even though we know that erections can happen without intent. The response would be don\u2019t look at her, so they don\u2019t have to look at him. The professor and school knows who this person is. This is a BS take especially for gender studies. Young black men are told wearing a hoodie makes them dangerous too. This is dumb.", "You have to be trolling, surely? 'Worth more'? Both groups are trying to learn, neither are inherently worth more than the other ffs.\n\nIt's on the teacher to address the issue with the class and point out that everyone is there to learn, and that we need to be understanding of others. He can then address the individuals if needed, and make it clear that he's spoken to everyone and no one needs to feel self-conscious *or* worried.", "Op shouldn't have to.  You don't get to tell people what to wear, esp if he's not violating any rules. If they have an issue with what he's wearing, they can leave.\n\nI googled \"Muslim head gear\" and hijab came up.  If it was the wrong word, then blame google or me for not doing enough research while trying to make a point.  My bad."]}
