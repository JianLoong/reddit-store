She interrupts, conversation over, go away.\n\nIf you want to continue in this relationship, find a couples therapist who specializes in communication skills.", "The short answer is NTA; chronic interrupters are rude. Longer answer is that you two are fundamentally incompatible and should end things.", "NTA, but don't shush her.  Just end the conversation.  People who constantly interrupt are being selfish and rude, it doesn't matter what justification they use.  If she just figures she's excused and isn't even trying to get better about it, she's got work to do.", "Nta.\n\n I get sick and tired of people  interrupting me.  Especially  when they have asked a question  and im trying to give them the answer. \n\n Ive gotten to the point when people do this to me, I walk away.", "NAH  but,... You are doomed as a couple. Her idea of the pace  and give and take of conversation is a bit annoying. You shushing her is rude. Nether quite hit my bar for AH behavior,  though.   \n\nYou'll do each other a favor of you help each other find ways to break the annoying habits as both will make people avoid talking to you. Try \"sweety, you just interrupted me again\" instead of shushing. Give her permission to say \"darlin', that was rude\" to shushing or any other rude responses\". In public,  just say \"sweety\", or \"darlin'\" as code words.", "NTA- I have very severe ADHD and constantly interrupt people without realizing what I\u2019m doing, I have told people to shush me. I whole heartedly do not mean to interrupt, so when I do I tell my boyfriend to shush me or tell me I interrupted. If I think it\u2019s that important I will write it down so I can say it later. Interrupting is rude, and although I understand her side of \u201cit\u2019s how she was raised\u201d she needs to at least make an effort to stop.", "NTA. It doesn't matter she was raised that way; it's her responsibility to break bad habits rather than using it as an excuse to keep being rude. I'd tell her exactly that, too, and that you will no longer shush her but will simply end any conversation immediately when she does it and will not resume the conversation until she pauses to think and then apologizes without making any excuses... On the phone? Hang up immediately she does it. In person? Walk away immediately. In the car? That gets a very sharp  \"No!\" and then silence. If it happens more than another few times without any attempt at change then there's no point continuing because she doesn't care enough about you to put in any effort.", "Nta but if you otherwise love your girlfriend. Help her break the habit instead of punishing her like a child. \n\nIf she sees her flaw but still has trouble correcting herself, be patient. Old habits die hard.\n\nMy suggestion is pick a random word like \"Pinapple\"\n\nWhen she inturrupts you, use this word, then continue.\n\nIt will give her the opportunity to correct herself without feeling chided and getting defensive. \n\nIf she is interested in being better. Be patient and support that. \n\nIf she isnt even interested and wants to continue interuppting. thats the hard one.", "NTA. I wouldn't shush her though (that can come across as very patronizing and maybe it's why she gets defensive). I'd simply stop talking when she interrupted, wait for her to finish, and then carry on with what I was saying. Eventually she will get the hint.", "NTA. Also know though that your relationship is failing the most basic requirement for success: effective communication.", "NTA. Both of my parents were raised as the middle kids out of 8/10. About 10 years ago, I got into the habit of stopping completely if I was interrupted out of protest - if what I was saying meant so little that they would interrupt, they clearly didn\u2019t care enough to hear. It\u2019s a work in progress because they had ~40-50 years of trying to sneak a word in edgewise before I tried helping correct their behavior, but it does help. Cutting her off to tell her to stop interrupting while she\u2019s interrupting someone else should work wonders as well. It\u2019s definitely a rude way to try and adjust the behavior, but constantly interrupting is equally if not more so rude. Everyone has work to do on themselves, and clearly this is one of her projects.", "NAH... yet\n\nIt sounds like she comes from an [interrupter / \"cooperative overlap\" culture](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/conversation-style-interruption-cooperative-overlapping.html), where it's normal for everyone to interrupt each other.  It's assumed that if you have something to say, you'll just jump in and say it.  You probably come from more of a \"turn taker\" culture, where it's polite to listen actively to someone and wait until there is a natural lull to speak.  \n\nIf you both work at it to understand the differences of these cultures and come up with healthy ways to respect each others' conversation styles, then it could work out.", "nta she needs to learn some manners and stop interrupting people while they\u2019re talking", "It depends. Do you ever take a breath to let her speak? There are situations where that's the only way to have another voice heard. I'm leaning YTA", "NTA. She should learn that it\u2019s not her place to interrupt you. Doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s used to doing it to you, it\u2019s just disrespectful.", "ESH: it\u2019s rude to sush her. It\u2019s rude to be interrupted. \n\nY\u2019all need to get on the same page.", "NTA chronic interruption is one of my biggest pet peeves and it\u2019s infuriating when people say \u201cthis is just how I am\u201d Interrupting is incredibly rude and if she doesn\u2019t want to change her behavior it means she is a rude person and she doesn\u2019t care to be nice", "NTA I deal with a similar issue and shushing is putting it a lot nicer than I have at times lol", "Nta. She shouldn\u2019t interrupt", "ESH\n\nHer for interrupting and you for shushing.\n\nTbh shushing or just ending the conversation are more ahole moves than interrupting.

It's amazingly effective.", "My issue with the turn taker concept (some people) is a lot never wind up their thought and just keep talking. Then if you interrupt, they are offended.

They asked why im mad.  And im like im trying  to answer  but you are over talking me.  .\n\n I have to say this is one of the way to make me go nice to bitch in .03 seconds", "Yup, that can definitely be an issue.  That's why it's very helpful in personal relationships and professional settings to raise awareness of these cultures and set up some processes that can be acceptable (if not perfect).  I'm more of a turn taker (Asian culture), but I also had years of debate and public speaking training. So I try my best to organize my ideas and be succinct, and I've also worked on constructive interruptions in professional settings.  I still get talked over a lot (even after half a sentence), and often focus my energy on active listening instead.  One thing that really helps is, in online meetings, using a text chat in parallel so there can be a way to contribute ideas without talking over (or if you get talked over but still have things to say).", "It must have been infuriating for her growing up.

She sounds like she's insecure from her family situation, but needs to learn to have conversations with people like an adult now", "I think it depends.

She is interrupting. I am also a bad interrupter and I usually apologize because I realize it almost immediately. This lack of self awareness is concerning.", "ESH. Please don\u2019t shush an adult. I know it\u2019s the absolute WORST when you are being interrupted. I learned to stop the conversation all together. I just won\u2019t continue. It has helped me immensely. She should allow you to finish what you are saying. I hope you guys work it out.", "Another way is to go silent at the interruption, wait till she runs out of steam, then continue the sentence as if the interruption hadn't happened. This does take the effort of remembering exactly what you were saying, but it's very effective if you can pull it off."]}
