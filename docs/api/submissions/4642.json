She said Dr. so and so recommended the group for her daughter, who is autistic. I asked if her daughter was a minor, and she said she was.

We do not allow anyone who isn't autistic into our meetings, ever, so we told her no.\n\nShe said she couldn't leave her daughter alone with us, especially because we already admitted we curse and discuss inappropriate topics.

And the doctor should be more aware of to whom she recommends attend the group.", "NTA - This is a meeting for adult women with autism. It is not geared towards teens with autism or family members of people with autism. There are other groups for those people. \n\nOne of the members who is a member of the doctor in question should say this to the doctor:\n\n\"We appreciate you referring patients to our group. However, we wanted to make it clear that this is a group for adult women with autism only. Please do not refer teens to this group.\"", "All groups have boundaries, it\u2019s a structure that suits your group and that has its limitations that helps the members who know the boundaries of their safe space. \n\nIt was kind of you to vote for the girl to attend and make a change to your group parameters that time even though it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe mother is the AH for expecting a group to accept her daughter without ringing to check beforehand and then expecting them to just allow her into that space as well. \n\nHow would she expect the daughter to share freely with her mother sitting there watching her talk.\n\nAnd NTA DR so and so would probably be mortified to think that somewhere they know is a good resource is being affected in this way", "NTA\n\nIf it really is an adults-only group meeting, then it is totally fine to enforce that rule.  Also, if the meeting is for people with autism only, you are being totally reasonable telling the mother she can't come.\n\nAnd you are right, whoever this doctor is doesn't have any authority to dictate the rules.  My guess is that the doctor wasn't aware that it was an adult-only group when they made the recommendation though, and I would be extremely surprised if they take any issue with what happened... if anything it was a mistake on the doctor's part to send their patient to the meeting and setting this whole thing into motion.", "NTA\n\nYou were doing everything properly - your group is for ADULT, Autistic, Women - it is a group where you all can speak openly and honestly about anything a member thinks and feels.  You shouldn't have to sensor your speech or topics.  Mom is not Autistic so that means she shouldn't be there.  The daughter is a minor (with a mother who seems to think her daughter has never heard a curse word) this isn't the group for her.  \n\nIf Dr SO&So has an issue they should contact you and ask your rules.  You are not beholden to this doctor, and the other member shouldn't worry about this - like you told her; she pays that doctor for help.  \n\nYou women were not unkind to the mother&daughter you simply told them the rules of the group.  \n\nI would think that since you all are adults real talk about topics of sexuality, drinking, past trauma, drugs use, birth control, possible abuse, etc could all come up - those are important things to talk about and you shouldn't have to constrain yourselves because a child is present.

The doctor should be checking with you and the group rather than just sending along anybody they feel might benefit. You tried to accommodate the daughter but the mother wanted to stay and observe, like some sort of helicoptering vulture parent.

You need a safe space to chat and vent, and it\u2019s none of the doctor\u2019s concern.", "NTA\nYou were willing to allow the teen but she could not talk freely with her mother there.\n\nDr so and so should not be recommending the meeting without knowing what goes on", "NTA.

You may have agreed to admit the teen for this meeting, but the mother should not have been permitted to attend a confidential group, especially if it could've led to her daughter feeling she couldn't talk openly in front of her mother. \n\nThe daughter, if she is allowed to attend any more meetings, should feel able to talk without editing herself for her mother's benefit. The mother can wait outside or go elsewhere until the meeting is over. \n\nIf the mother doesn't want to do that, neither she nor the daughter should be admitted, as the mother's presence would be disruptive to the group. This situation has nothing to do with the doctor. The mother is essentially demanding to speak to the manager and doesn't realise or care that she's in the wrong store.", "NTA- it doesn't sound like it was actually the appropriate meeting for her. And it was completely inappropriate for her mother to insist on attending. Hopefully when she goes to complain to the Dr. they will explain some of this.", "NTA", "Nta.

Now the pcp can find them a pediatric therapist where they will fit in better.", "NTA - You held a boundary and gave a reasonable accommodation. It\u2019s their choice on what to do with that information.", "NTA- I agree with not having a minor in a group designated for adult women. The child may be exposed to topics inappropriate for a child, not just curse words. Also a child may not understand how important it is to respect the privacy of the group.\nThe mother was totally out of line. Being that she threatened to call the doctor, whoever leads the group should reach out to this doctor to let them know it\u2019s not a group for children. And that when they refer people, to make sure they know the dr is not associated or leading the group.", "NTA the doctor absolutely is though. If they are going to be referring people to your group they should have touched base with you to make sure who it was suitable for. This is on them. \n\nYou have to put the existing attendees first. Adapting the support group to accommodate a wider group people usually means compromises (such as people not being free to discuss adult topics in this case) and therefore isn't a good idea to put people on the spot.\n\nAnd completely understandable not to allow spectators/family members in.", "NTA I'm in multiple online support groups with similar rules, those rules are needed to create the safe space necessary for those groups to function.  I'm in my early 40s and I don't want teen drama in my autistic groups.\n\n I would reach out to said doctor, to make an introduction as the group facilitator and discuss how it's run and who is welcome.  That was an awkward spot he put you and his patient into.  I feel bad that girl's mom messed it up for her.  I hate to think of what sort of nasty things mom said in the car home, I would have been mortified.  \n\nPotentially if there are more than one or two teens, the group could offer an occasional \"ask your elders\" night every few months?  Where it's centered on the teens, rather than just censoring your own group discussions.  \n\nBut it really isn't fair to ask you to change how your group is run, especially when there are so few autistic services that aren't aimed at young to teen boys.  \n\nSounds like you dodged an Autistic Warrior Moooooommmmmm!(tm) and I don't blame you.", "NTA. Lots of groups have \"closed\" meetings, meaning people not of that population aren't welcome. In this instance, it's perfectly reasonable the non-autistic mother should not be allowed. Of course I understand her not wanting to leave her daughter alone with strangers as well, but that means she needs to find a youth-specific support group for her. Perhaps that Dr. can help initiate one.", "NTA - the girl would be much better off with a group that is addressing topics that actually impact her at her current stage of life.  And the mother sounds like she can't tell the difference between the doctor's mention of a resource and an actual prescription for care, which are two completely separate things.  She has a right to not want to leave her minor child in a discussion with a bunch of strangers, but she has no business at all intruding into your confidential discussions.  She needs to locate a more appropriate support group for her daughter and a message to the doctor that your group is in fact adult-only so please, no recommendations for children going forward as it just leads to issues.  I'm sure the doctor will understand fully.", "NTA- at first I thought YTA but ad I read on I could see that's not the case. Perhaps the DR. Could go out her way and organise a meeting for minors to share experiences and support each other. I would get in touch with the Dr and explain it's for adult women only to avoid any future embarrasment", "Nah (except possibly the dr)\n\nThere was a mishap in communication that all stems from the dr.

At all. The topics a teen group would discuss vs an adult group can be miles apart, and for good reason. Also, a teen group may have parents present but an adult group not. \n\nDr so and so doesn\u2019t have a say here.

However, y'all did the right thing by informing her that the meeting was for adult women with autism, so NTA. \n\nIt might be helpful if you (or someone who works with the doctor) gently gives that doctor some feedback about who is and isn't welcome in the group, and ask if the doctor knows of other autism support groups for kids so that if something similar happens again you can direct the misinformed parents elsewhere.", "How old was the daughter? 16, 17, 13? etc.", "Reminds me of the post where OP was the member of a support group for disabled parents and a perfectly healthy parent of a disabled child was trying to use the group as some free childcare.\n\nObvious nta. The group was even willing to compromise  and let the kid join. They weren't going to compromise on only autistic people joining, which is sort of the entire point of such a support group.", "Yeah, saying that should do it. You have autism and being female in common, but also being ADULTS in common. It should have been obvious to that parent that your group wasn\u2019t going to be for her. There\u2019s a big difference in how a bunch of friendly peer adults want to interact vs an all ages group.", "It may be worthwhile to also determine, as a group, if you would be welcoming of non-binary autists or trans autists (either trans women or trans men). People who were assigned female at birth but have a different gender identity may benefit from your group, but it's up to you about whether you'd welcome them.", "Yup, exactly. Adult topics are fine to discuss but a teen will have little to no contribution. Like you do not join a parenting group if you are not a parent (about to be a parent, or parenting a child in some way even if they are not your own)", "I wondered about that. No mention of anyone in charge? Seems obviously like their responsibility. Unless this group has no such person?", "It's impossible to know whether the doctor actually recommended the group or if the mother was asking for resources and the doctor said \"well, maybe you could try this group, but it might not be suitable for your daughter.\"\n\nThe mother is obviously pushy, and has no issue treading on other people's boundaries to get what she wants, so personally, I'm inclined to take her story that the doctor recommended the group with a grain of salt.", "That\u2019s a good point", "Oh i kinda thought OP was the facilitator  but I guess not", "This was my take too... the doctor might just have heard about the group in passing but not known any details (like that it was adult only).", "Maybe, but OP says \u201cI'm in a support group for autistic women\u201d, so it seemed not.", "Seems weird not to ask so they can refer properly.", "Yeah i saw that too but was confused when OP started asking if they were a minor. Regardless, it should be the leader of the group who talks to this Dr"]}
