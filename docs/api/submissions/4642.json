She said Dr. so and so recommended the group for her daughter, who is autistic. I asked if her daughter was a minor, and she said she was. I said that wasn't a good idea, because the group is for adult women, and her daughter might here curse words or discussions of adult matters.\n\nThe woman said Dr. so and so probably wouldn't be happy to hear that, which was confusing, because we aren't affiliated with Dr. so and so. One of the other women said maybe we could do a teen-friendly meeting just this once. We voted, and everyone said they were okay with that. However, the mom also wanted to attend the meeting. We do not allow anyone who isn't autistic into our meetings, ever, so we told her no.\n\nShe said she couldn't leave her daughter alone with us, especially because we already admitted we curse and discuss inappropriate topics. I said that was fine, they were welcome to leave. We went into the conference room and tried to begin our meeting, but she followed us in. I had to go get the librarian to come tell her the conference room was reserved for a private event, so she couldn't come in.\n\nThe mom said she was going to email Dr. so and so and left. The meeting went fine, but afterwards one of the women who is a patient of Dr. so and so asked me if I thought her doctor would be mad at her. I said I had no idea, but you don't owe anything to Dr. so and so's other patients.

And the doctor should be more aware of to whom she recommends attend the group.", "NTA - This is a meeting for adult women with autism. It is not geared towards teens with autism or family members of people with autism. There are other groups for those people. \n\nOne of the members who is a member of the doctor in question should say this to the doctor:\n\n\"We appreciate you referring patients to our group. However, we wanted to make it clear that this is a group for adult women with autism only. Please do not refer teens to this group.\"", "All groups have boundaries, it\u2019s a structure that suits your group and that has its limitations that helps the members who know the boundaries of their safe space. \n\nIt was kind of you to vote for the girl to attend and make a change to your group parameters that time even though it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe mother is the AH for expecting a group to accept her daughter without ringing to check beforehand and then expecting them to just allow her into that space as well. \n\nHow would she expect the daughter to share freely with her mother sitting there watching her talk.\n\nAnd NTA DR so and so would probably be mortified to think that somewhere they know is a good resource is being affected in this way", "NTA\n\nIf it really is an adults-only group meeting, then it is totally fine to enforce that rule.  Also, if the meeting is for people with autism only, you are being totally reasonable telling the mother she can't come.\n\nAnd you are right, whoever this doctor is doesn't have any authority to dictate the rules.  My guess is that the doctor wasn't aware that it was an adult-only group when they made the recommendation though, and I would be extremely surprised if they take any issue with what happened... if anything it was a mistake on the doctor's part to send their patient to the meeting and setting this whole thing into motion.", "NTA\n\nYou were doing everything properly - your group is for ADULT, Autistic, Women - it is a group where you all can speak openly and honestly about anything a member thinks and feels.  You shouldn't have to sensor your speech or topics.  Mom is not Autistic so that means she shouldn't be there.  The daughter is a minor (with a mother who seems to think her daughter has never heard a curse word) this isn't the group for her.  \n\nIf Dr SO&So has an issue they should contact you and ask your rules.  You are not beholden to this doctor, and the other member shouldn't worry about this - like you told her; she pays that doctor for help.  \n\nYou women were not unkind to the mother&daughter you simply told them the rules of the group.  \n\nI would think that since you all are adults real talk about topics of sexuality, drinking, past trauma, drugs use, birth control, possible abuse, etc could all come up - those are important things to talk about and you shouldn't have to constrain yourselves because a child is present.

The doctor should be checking with you and the group rather than just sending along anybody they feel might benefit. You tried to accommodate the daughter but the mother wanted to stay and observe, like some sort of helicoptering vulture parent.

You need a safe space to chat and vent, and it\u2019s none of the doctor\u2019s concern.", "NTA\nYou were willing to allow the teen but she could not talk freely with her mother there.\n\nDr so and so should not be recommending the meeting without knowing what goes on", "NTA.

You may have agreed to admit the teen for this meeting, but the mother should not have been permitted to attend a confidential group, especially if it could've led to her daughter feeling she couldn't talk openly in front of her mother. \n\nThe daughter, if she is allowed to attend any more meetings, should feel able to talk without editing herself for her mother's benefit. The mother can wait outside or go elsewhere until the meeting is over. \n\nIf the mother doesn't want to do that, neither she nor the daughter should be admitted, as the mother's presence would be disruptive to the group. This situation has nothing to do with the doctor. The mother is essentially demanding to speak to the manager and doesn't realise or care that she's in the wrong store.", "NTA- it doesn't sound like it was actually the appropriate meeting for her. And it was completely inappropriate for her mother to insist on attending. Hopefully when she goes to complain to the Dr. they will explain some of this.", "NTA", "Nta.

Now the pcp can find them a pediatric therapist where they will fit in better.", "NTA - You held a boundary and gave a reasonable accommodation. It\u2019s their choice on what to do with that information.", "NTA- I agree with not having a minor in a group designated for adult women. The child may be exposed to topics inappropriate for a child, not just curse words. Also a child may not understand how important it is to respect the privacy of the group.\nThe mother was totally out of line. Being that she threatened to call the doctor, whoever leads the group should reach out to this doctor to let them know it\u2019s not a group for children. And that when they refer people, to make sure they know the dr is not associated or leading the group.", "NTA the doctor absolutely is though. If they are going to be referring people to your group they should have touched base with you to make sure who it was suitable for. This is on them. \n\nYou have to put the existing attendees first. Adapting the support group to accommodate a wider group people usually means compromises (such as people not being free to discuss adult topics in this case) and therefore isn't a good idea to put people on the spot.\n\nAnd completely understandable not to allow spectators/family members in.", "NTA I'm in multiple online support groups with similar rules, those rules are needed to create the safe space necessary for those groups to function.  I'm in my early 40s and I don't want teen drama in my autistic groups.\n\n I would reach out to said doctor, to make an introduction as the group facilitator and discuss how it's run and who is welcome.  That was an awkward spot he put you and his patient into.  I feel bad that girl's mom messed it up for her.  I hate to think of what sort of nasty things mom said in the car home, I would have been mortified.  \n\nPotentially if there are more than one or two teens, the group could offer an occasional \"ask your elders\" night every few months?  Where it's centered on the teens, rather than just censoring your own group discussions.  \n\nBut it really isn't fair to ask you to change how your group is run, especially when there are so few autistic services that aren't aimed at young to teen boys.  \n\nSounds like you dodged an Autistic Warrior Moooooommmmmm!(tm) and I don't blame you.", "NTA. Lots of groups have \"closed\" meetings, meaning people not of that population aren't welcome. In this instance, it's perfectly reasonable the non-autistic mother should not be allowed. Of course I understand her not wanting to leave her daughter alone with strangers as well, but that means she needs to find a youth-specific support group for her. Perhaps that Dr. can help initiate one.", "NTA - the girl would be much better off with a group that is addressing topics that actually impact her at her current stage of life.  And the mother sounds like she can't tell the difference between the doctor's mention of a resource and an actual prescription for care, which are two completely separate things.  She has a right to not want to leave her minor child in a discussion with a bunch of strangers, but she has no business at all intruding into your confidential discussions.  She needs to locate a more appropriate support group for her daughter and a message to the doctor that your group is in fact adult-only so please, no recommendations for children going forward as it just leads to issues.  I'm sure the doctor will understand fully.", "NTA- at first I thought YTA but ad I read on I could see that's not the case. Perhaps the DR. Could go out her way and organise a meeting for minors to share experiences and support each other. I would get in touch with the Dr and explain it's for adult women only to avoid any future embarrasment", "Nah (except possibly the dr)\n\nThere was a mishap in communication that all stems from the dr.

At all. The topics a teen group would discuss vs an adult group can be miles apart, and for good reason. Also, a teen group may have parents present but an adult group not. \n\nDr so and so doesn\u2019t have a say here.

However, y'all did the right thing by informing her that the meeting was for adult women with autism, so NTA. \n\nIt might be helpful if you (or someone who works with the doctor) gently gives that doctor some feedback about who is and isn't welcome in the group, and ask if the doctor knows of other autism support groups for kids so that if something similar happens again you can direct the misinformed parents elsewhere.", "How old was the daughter? 16, 17, 13? etc.", "Reminds me of the post where OP was the member of a support group for disabled parents and a perfectly healthy parent of a disabled child was trying to use the group as some free childcare.\n\nObvious nta. The group was even willing to compromise  and let the kid join. They weren't going to compromise on only autistic people joining, which is sort of the entire point of such a support group.", "Yeah, saying that should do it. You have autism and being female in common, but also being ADULTS in common. It should have been obvious to that parent that your group wasn\u2019t going to be for her. There\u2019s a big difference in how a bunch of friendly peer adults want to interact vs an all ages group.", "It may be worthwhile to also determine, as a group, if you would be welcoming of non-binary autists or trans autists (either trans women or trans men). People who were assigned female at birth but have a different gender identity may benefit from your group, but it's up to you about whether you'd welcome them.", "Yup, exactly. Adult topics are fine to discuss but a teen will have little to no contribution. Like you do not join a parenting group if you are not a parent (about to be a parent, or parenting a child in some way even if they are not your own)", "I wondered about that. No mention of anyone in charge? Seems obviously like their responsibility. Unless this group has no such person?", "It's impossible to know whether the doctor actually recommended the group or if the mother was asking for resources and the doctor said \"well, maybe you could try this group, but it might not be suitable for your daughter.\"\n\nThe mother is obviously pushy, and has no issue treading on other people's boundaries to get what she wants, so personally, I'm inclined to take her story that the doctor recommended the group with a grain of salt.", "That\u2019s a good point", "Oh i kinda thought OP was the facilitator  but I guess not", "This was my take too... the doctor might just have heard about the group in passing but not known any details (like that it was adult only).", "Maybe, but OP says \u201cI'm in a support group for autistic women\u201d, so it seemed not.", "Seems weird not to ask so they can refer properly.", "Yeah i saw that too but was confused when OP started asking if they were a minor. Regardless, it should be the leader of the group who talks to this Dr", "NTA\n\nYou have formed the group yourselves to sit the situation and needs you have - sticking to an adult membership and not allowing non-members to attend seems completely reasonable. Start making exceptions to those rules and the group will no longer be meeting the needs of the people you specifically created it for.\n\nI do definitely see it as problematic that a doctor is recommending a support group they don't have any affiliation with or specific knowledge of - it seems like it may be worth someone having a word with this doctor to straighten out the situation, and perhaps seeing some more formal ground rules or a system to give you information regarding prospective members before accepting them.  Not only to avoid situations like this where there has been a misunderstanding, but also practical considerations like ensuring you have suitable resources in place to cope with the numbers you have.", "NTA.  Your group is for adults, not minors.  Not only might some of the material be inappropriate for a minor, but the fact that she's there might make some of the group members feel less comfortable sharing about their lives.  \n\nThere is nothing wrong about support groups being limited to a certain group of people.  And how you handled the situation was completely reasonable.  That mother was being pushy.  No one in your group needs to feel bad about this!  Hopefully the teen girl can get connected to a group that is geared towards her own age group.", "NTA. You all handled that very respectfully.\n\nThe mother's antagonistic approach was uncalled for.", "NTA. You voiced concerns but were willing to tone it down and make it appropriate for a younger member. Mom decided to keep trying to take more and tried to push a hard boundary, and got angry when you all refused to let her.\n\nAnd why tf would a doctor care if a group of adult women are swearing and discussing inappropriate topics? So long as no one in the group is being made uncomfortable and there's no true harm being done there's no issue", "NTA the group wasn\u2019t appropriate for her daughter, I can understand wanting to advocate for her child but she went about it the wrong way. She needs to channel that energy into researching the right group for her daughter, not harass you all into letting both of them join", "NTA. I'd be contacting the Dr office myself and explaining this to them. Maybe they're unaware of it being adult women and that non autistic women are not welcome. Period. Either way you did nothing wrong.", "NTA - The mother sounds entitled AF.", "NTA. The meeting is for adults. She was a teenager.", "NTA\n\nWho DOES organize and run the group?\n\nThat person needs to contact Dr X and explain that the group is for 18+ only. This way Dr X can make sure they don\u2019t send along anymore minors.", "N t a if this girl is under 16 \n\nY t a if she was 16 or 17", "This. OP, if you're not the doctor's patient, so you won't be risking backlash, I would be tempted to email her and let her know that it's a group for adult women only. I would be nice about it and just let her know you're informing her so that another teen doesn't have an uncomfortable experience. NTA.", "Or the doctor possibly thought that the young woman was mature enough to benefit from an adult group? Without her mother there of course", "Hey if you don't mind sharing with me. You can dm me, but where can I find autistic support groups online", "Arguably, though, most of the group members are more benefitted by the current format with just autistic adult women. So the moral thing to do would be to exclude them.", "Or from the mother herself.", "Being autistic means you constantly have to be mindful of social rules that are obvious to other people but not you. Worrying you're doing something wrong is a fairly natural response to that. It doesn't have to be the doctor's fault.", "I think calling it a \u201creferral\u201d makes it sound much more official than it is.", "That's probably true. More like \"here's a resource I've heard of, why don't you see what they're about\" could even be on a list of community resources the doctors office hands out.", "NTA", "NAH. You were right to be concerned about a minor attending the meeting and especially for refusing to allow the Mom to attend. However, the Mom wasn\u2019t an AH, either. They were referred by a medical professional they trusted. It\u2019s fair that she was concerned about leaving her minor daughter with a group of people she doesn\u2019t know. She sounds like she might have been a little too judgmental (and possibly jumped to conclusions) about potential cussing and the content of the adult topics discussed but without more information on her, I can say she\u2019s an AH for that. It was a little pushy of her to attempt to push her way in after the conversation but I think (ok hope) that that had more to do with her desire to help her child than to be an AH.", "NTA - but I can understand why someone would worry about pissing off a health care provider! Perhaps you could offer to help this person craft an email to their Dr. clarifying who the group is for to avoid future confusion.", "NTA. Dr. So and so shouldn't be recommending groups without more info too.", ">one of the women who is a patient of Dr. so and so asked me if I thought her doctor would be mad at her\n\nIf they are, Dr so and so has NO right being a doctor", "NTA\n\n1. The doctor needs to be informed that they should not recommend the group to minors and needs to be clear that the group is not affiliated with him/her.\n2. The mother was not willing to understand the facts of the group so that she could continue to expect whatever she wanted.\n3. The group was willing to accommodate the young lady for this one meeting, but that wasn't enough for her. She wanted to run roughshod over yet another (and very key) element of the group. Even after she was offered a clear choice, she tried to insist on getting her way.\n4. The group was kind but not a pushover. Good for the group!", "NTA - I would also type up the foundations of your group (age, female, autistic, inappropriate at time) and pop over to doc such and such. Give it to them and in a polite way say you appreciate the Recs but here are some of the boundaries the group has to avoid issues in the future.", "NTA, and frankly if you got the mothers name and have contact with the doctor I'd email them and politely ask state \"Due to actions by X we would like to remind you that our group meeting is meant to be a safe space for those with autism so please be careful about reccomending it to minors since their parents may attempt to force their way into our meetings.\" but I'm a pretty spiteful person when it comes to this level of entitlement.  That and I'd want the doctor aware the parent can't be trusted to respect boundaries.", "100% NTA, that mother was totally the AH and I would suggest you call Dr X and tell her you do not appreciate how she sent a minor with a confrontational parent to your meeting that is for adults.", "NTA. Asking for special consideration and refusing to abide by your rules are huge narcissism tells. If someone has the time and energy, maybe they can direct that poor girl to some resources for dealing with narcissistic parents while autistic and teenaged...not easy, let me tell ya!", "We do. We vote on stuff like date and time or anything else that comes up. I make the reservations for the activity room, but that doesn't mean I'm in charge or anything. I just happen to have a credit card.", "\"Make your support group about the needs of people outside the group.\"\n\nThat's missing the point of groups like this.", "Yep, autistic therapist of autistic clients here. It sounds like a rules clarification would be good. My guess is that this clinician judged this teen to be a solid fit for the group, but didn't take mom into consideration.  \n\n\n\n\nThis mother's behavior is extremely frustrating to me.\n\n\n She elbowed her way into a group that was not for her, threatened odd vague social consequences (\"Dr.X won't be happy to hear this\" okay? And? Are you going to tell on her? Is OP going to have to stand in the corner with the other naughty children? Like damn lady put away the shamethrower) and helicoptering her daughter smh. If the kid has never heard swearing before she's long overdue.", "Exactly. Dr. Probably didn't realize it was adults only.  I'm sure she'll hear about it soon though lol", "You could argue that yeah. I wouldn\u2019t personally.", "Gonna steal \"shamethrower\" for future use, that's the first time I've seen it.", "NTA", "NTA you made the boundaries clear and gave her the options. \nI do think there is something very fishy about this trend of high functioning \"autistic\" women. There is clearly an issue here of overdiagnosis for a \"disability\" that is really just an excuse for anti-social behavior. So for that ESH.", "Nope. NTA. Someone needs to tell Dr. So and So the ground rules, though.", "NTA", "NTA The woman clearly thought you guys answer to this doctor, and you simply don't. Her daughter was too young for the event -- that's all there is to it. Autistic teens must need different help than adults do. Guarantee if you'd let them stay, the mom would have started \"complaining\" to the doctor that you weren't helping her daughter enough.", "NTA\nThe member that also sees the same doctor and was concerned about the Dr's reaction to hearing about how the group handled the teen may have increased anxiety about it as a result of their autism (Hoepfully that makes sense). The mother should have backed down as soon as the group told her that it isn't meant for teens and maybe asked if anyone in the group knew of a group for teens. The doctor isn't affiliated with the group, but they really should have someone on their staff do a little research to find out more about it before referring people to it. I can imagine a patient coming in raving about this awesome group they found and the doctor just starts telling other patients about it. Support groups are not spectator sports and I doubt an adult facilitator of a teen support group would allow a parent spectator in during the meeting (maybe nearby in another room, but not in the meeting). It would absolutely suck all the trust out of the room.\n\nETA: Since the group not designed for teens, it also means there has been no vetting of anyone in the group. Having the teen in there without the mother could possibly open the group to liability issues, real or perceived. Not saying anyone in the group would do anything out of line, but a teen group would be supervised by multiple adults that have been vetted and trained to handle teen issues for the safety and security of the adults and the teens.", "NTA, this group is inappropriate for a teenager; having her there would make it harder for you to be open in addressing adult topics; and it would be intrusive to have a parent who is not a group member attend.  The teenager would receive far greater benefit in a group specifically for young people.  You did the right thing.", "NTA Some outsider doesn't get to come in and tell you how your meetings go. The mother is double an outsider. Not of your existing group and not of the population that would need it.", "NTA, you had good reasons to set those boundaries and were even willing to accommodate the daughter.

She just had no manager to demand to speak to.", "A woman who can't take No for ana answer like that mom would have ruined their meeting by insisting they do x, y, and z to help her daughter, stop talking about x, y, and z around her daughter, threaten to complain to this doctor that they weren't properly helping her daughter... It's never safe to associate with stubborn, entitled, pushy people.", "How is it illogical for the members of a small group with no leader to make decisions and rules for the group?", "A 16 or 17 year old is going to need a different sort of help than adults do.", "And now is a good time to give the doctor feedback about the group so she can make more appropriate referrals. Maybe someone else wants to start a teen autistic group.", "Even as her patient, she should! That kind of feedback is so helpful. People give that kind of feedback all the time about PTs, nursing facilities, etc. This is just another community resource, the doctor will fully understand if you explain that there is adult content discussed and non autistic people cannot attend", "And she should  be clear to the patients  that she, the doctor  has no influence  nor any connection  to the group.
