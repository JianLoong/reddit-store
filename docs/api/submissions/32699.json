Got started with a financial advisor, who guided me into investing in local businesses and real estate. And that's that. It's been sitting there since, just growing.\n\nFast forward to today. I'm getting ready to start making dinner, and my phone rings. I can't get to it but figure I'll call them back. Then comes a text.

The crux of your decision then, and for her offense now, is that you could not trust her. I repeat it to emphasize the importance of allowing it to resound unadulterated when spoken. Additionally, you took the safest route out for your self, one that involved hiding and avoiding hard and honest discussion.  \n\nNot a good look at all for just about anyone but women are pretty apt to recoil and lose respect when seeing their man behave as a child.

I'd imagine they were engaged at the time, or at the very least in a serious relationship. \n\nDoes being legally married make any difference when it's likely they had a relationship that was in proximity of that when he won?", "This.", "Really?  You don't think she would be this mad about being lied to for all those years if he hadn't been on her ass about spending?", "OP lied to her for *years* (not only lied to, but made to feel as though her husband doesn't trust her), she finds out, understandbly she is distraught, she leaves, she shows up at her sisters (in a state). \n\nIt's reasonable that someone would need to vent to the people she trusts most, is it not?", "wouldn't have been posted previously; sorry, i've read this one before but in the wife won the lotto perspective, almost verbatim", "> She did this to herself with her reckless spending habits.\n\nHere's the problem with this -\n\nEven if we take this to be a legitimate reason of keeping it from her, OP said this -\"I truly didn\u2019t want to continue keeping it from her as **her spending habits have improved a lot but I figured it was too late**\". Here's OP acknowleding that his wife has made an improvement on her spending habits, and not just an improvement but \"a lot\", and yet he STILL didn't tell her.\n\nHow is the OP not an asshole for that?\n\nAnd here's the thing, for me it isn't even about the money, itself. It's about the fact OP thought he was doing the right thing by keeping this information from her, yet once that reason became invalid, he still kept it from her.", "She can't touch it pre- marriage money / account !", "OP was not single.

You think she signed without reading?", "Dont you typically have to disclose all assets in good faith when you draft a prenup?", "I did not say it\u2019s not justified :D", "This is oddly specific. Sounds like projection to me.", "Not necessarily. If it\u2019s true that there finances have been fine. I think he\u2019s leaving out a part \u2026.

It\u2019s his decision. \n\nYou\u2019re making a false assumption saying that \u2018he made her feel as if he didn\u2019t trust her\u2019 as well. While he disclosed to us that he had concerns about her spending habits, which influences his decision not to disclose it, at not point did he say that to her. If he said that outright to her, it would justify her reaction a bit, but it would still be immature. She\u2019s not upset that he didn\u2019t trust her, she\u2019s upset because she feels entitled to it.\n\nOnce again, No. It\u2019s not reasonable to air out personal business business in a fit of anger.

What sage advice is your sister gonna give you? A pat on the back while she says \u2018oh that\u2019s mean, he shouldn\u2019t of said that. He should have told you\u2019 \n\nHe clearly has gone out of his way to keep this under wraps. He accepted it anonymously, and has worked hard to keep it private. And what does she do? Goes and tells everyone his private business? Such a disrespectful move, and for what? That Pat on the back?\n\nThis is all furthered by her letting her family barrage his with calls saying he\u2019s an asshole. For what? What did he do? Do they think they are entitled to know about it too? Is he an asshole because he didn\u2019t share his money with them?

I don't care for whatever mental gymnastics you're trying to insert when keeping this from your life-partner is a breach of the relationship.\n\nThat is the point here.\n\nHe required the money less than a year from when they were legally married, therefore, we can assume they were at least in a serious relationship at the time and likely were engaged. This isn't a court of law, so the only thing that should matter in this context is that they were a couple.\n\n>You\u2019re making a false assumption saying that \u2018he made her feel as if he didn\u2019t trust her\u2019 as well.

If he said that outright to her, it would justify her reaction a bit, but it would still be immature.\n\nThat's not a false assumption. An assumption, yes, but not a false one.\n\nIt stands to reason that because he kept this from her for so long that she'll question whether or not her husband trusts her. She'll be thinking what else has he been keeping from me?\n\nHow do you know what he said and didn't say to her, and how does that make any difference? He won money when they were together, he then kept that a secret whilst they were together, that's a valid enough reason to get upset.\n\n>She\u2019s not upset that he didn\u2019t trust her, she\u2019s upset because she feels entitled to it.\n\nYou have absolutely no idea this is the case. This is nothing more than projection. You have absolutely no grounds to make this claim, which seems to be the problem here where you're pulling shit like this out of thin air.\n\n>Once again, No. It\u2019s not reasonable to air out personal business business in a fit of anger. Act like an adult. This isn\u2019t a situation she needed to share and get opinions on.\n\nWho are you to say what she can and cannot share information with?\n\nIf OP kept a health-related issue from his wife, then yes, that would be more applicable here, because that would be more personal, but she's will within her right to tell her sisters this because she needs to get advice on the matter. She needs to know if she's been made a fool of.\n\n>Even if he did say that he didn\u2019t trust her because of her spending habits.. boooo fuckin hoo, handle it.\n\nI'm going to stop here.\n\nThis is the nail in the coffin of you not being able to provide any real objective insight. You're using conjecture to unnecessarily defend the OP and condemn the wife, for whatever reason I don't care for."]}
