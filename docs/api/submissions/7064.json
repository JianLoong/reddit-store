Ann asked if Al could stay with us and I didn\u2019t see why not. Ann isn\u2019t on speaking terms with her parents and I assumed Al probably also wasn\u2019t and didn\u2019t have another place to go. Plus I really loved Ann and I wanted to show her how important she was to me.\n\nHere is the issue: Ann told me Al had a mild dog allergy. When I initially spoke with both of them I said I would do my best to accommodate but would not, under any circumstances, get rid of Bo. Both understood and Al said his allergy wasn\u2019t too bad.\n\nAl moved in and to be honest he wasn\u2019t a great roommate. He didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to move out, as he spent most of his time sleeping and playing video games instead of looking for work. He didn\u2019t pitch in for chores and let laundry pile up in his room, then acted confused when I told him he had to do his own laundry. He ate the food we cooked but did not help with cooking or buying groceries. Worst, he ordered lots of fast food for himself and left wrappers, bags, and old food in his room which made the whole apartment smell.\u00a0\n\nAfter a month or so, Al said his allergies were getting worse and asked me to consider putting Bo in a shelter. I said absolutely not, but\u00a0 Ann said we should consider getting rid of Bo to accommodate her brother\u2019s needs. I said no and we would not be discussing this further. She called me TA for \u201cchoosing my dog over my family.\u201d  \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s when I snapped. I said Al is not family and he has been nothing but a hassle for the past month, and that if she wants to babysit her older brother she can find her own place. She has no legal right to stay here because my name is on the lease and I pay rent (Ann is in grad school and does not make enough money to afford a decent apartment on her own). She tried again to convince me that I should prioritize Al over Bo, so I gave her an ultimatum. Either Al is gone in twenty-four hours or I kick BOTH of them out. Bo stays no matter what. Both have since moved out, and while Ann and I are not officially broken up, I haven\u2019t heard from her in a few days.\n\nI know this may sound harsh but Bo IS my family. He has been with me through some of my hardest times and he is a rescue, which means he was already abandoned once, and I will NOT let that happen again. I feel nothing for Al and, while I thought I loved Ann, her willingness to get rid of someone I love as much as her, made my feelings change. When I explained this to my parents and sister, however, they said I should have at least considered getting rid of Bo to accommodate Al, and that they could even take care of Bo themselves so he didn\u2019t have to go to a shelter. They said if I saw Ann as family, which I did at one point, I should be able to make sacrifices. But that was a sacrifice I wasn\u2019t willing to make. Does that make me TA?", "created_utc": 1673452626, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10983nf/aita_for_choosing_my_dog_over_my_family_by/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kicking her out was breaking up with her, and good for you! She's clearly heartless to consider putting your dog in a shelter for a lame roommate who could've taken an allergy pill.", "NTA, if she loves you she never would have asked you to get rid of your dog.  She\u2019s prioritizing her brother over you, and your feelings.  You\u2019re probably better off just moving on, and finding someone who wants the same things out of life.  \n\nYour family is also wrong, and I\u2019m honestly not sure why they would take her side.  Some people just don\u2019t care as much about animals, which is very sad.  Animals are better than most people I\u2019ve met.", "NTA\n\n\"He didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to move out, as he spent most of his time sleeping and playing video games instead of looking for work. He didn\u2019t pitch in for chores and let laundry pile up in his room, then acted confused when I told him he had to do his own laundry. He ate the food we cooked but did not help with cooking or buying groceries. \" - so far no difference in behaviour between him and Bo.  Then we get to \"Worst, he ordered lots of fast food for himself and left wrappers, bags, and old food in his room which made the whole apartment smell.\" - Bo is housetrained to not make a mess and is far less hassle!\n\nWise choice - Bo is far more loyal and less demanding!", "NTA. You made your stance known before Al moved in. He's just mooching and taking advantage of you.", "NTA.\n\nThe arrangement was supposed to be temporary. It wouldn\u2019t matter if he was the best roommate on the planet, rehoming a dog for a temporary guest who knew what he was walking I to and agreed to it, makes zero sense and is completely unacceptable. \n\nPets aren\u2019t disposable. I get some people don\u2019t see them as apart of the family, but for a pet, their owner is their family. Their owner is the only family most of them got. \n\nDon\u2019t let your family guilt you about sacrifices. You don\u2019t sacrifice family because someone else is to lazy to take his antihistamines. Again, this was a TEMPORARY thing. Why In the world would you rehome your dog so a temporary guest could further take over your apartment?", "NtA . Bo is your family and he predates both of the other players in this scenario. Ann and Al both knew your dog was not an option that was ever on the table. Ann's willingness to get rid of your companion over what is supposed to be a temporary living arrangement is telling .", "NTA - You made your conditions about Bo clear from the start and Al's stay was always meant to be temporary (at least as far as you were told). It is better you know now that Ann is willing to overlook this type of behavior from her brother and willing to go back on her word if he asks her to. How to deal with family members in these types of situations is a common issue of compatibility in relationships. \n\nYou DID make a sacrifice for your GF - you let him move into your apartment in the first place. Al is not a young child who needed a home. He was an adult who felt entitled to mooch off you with no end in site while expecting you to accommodate his every wish. Putting up with his atrocious behavior was too much to ask. Being willing to make a sacrifice for family is not the same as letting them walk all over you - which is what Al AND Ann were trying to do.", "NTA. If Ann loved you, she wouldn't have asked you to re\u2013home your dog for her ne'er\u2013do\u2013well brother. Congratulations, and it looks like you dodged a bullet!", "NTA, Ann and Al sound exhausting and entitled.  Our fur babies are family.", "NTA, you did the right thing. Whilst I understand your family are trying to be helpful, they don\u2019t seem to have very good boundaries. You don\u2019t move into a family member\u2019s home and then demand that they get rid of their pet. My own sister wouldn\u2019t do that to me. It\u2019s not something you ever ask of someone you love. It\u2019s a shame Ann might have been bullied into supporting her brother, but that\u2019s not your responsibility.", "Wtf is wrong with these people? Pets ARE Family and are not disposable! You were 100% right on this, absolutely NTA \n\nYou were not being unreasonable at all.. if there was one thing I\u2019d have done if it was me is that I\u2019d have talked to Ann previously and told her that Al was being lazy and he should help more with the chores (so that she could speak with him, since she is her sister), but you acted perfectly in regards to Bo", "How long was Ann planning on letting Al stay with you guys? I mean, if you actually had agreed to let the dog go. Rehoming a pet is not something you do for a few weeks, I would think. \n\nSounds to me she / they were planning on him living there forever. Very strange, especially since he was behaving very badly as a roommate.\n\nGood move, OP, I think this girl was not right for you and it was better you found out sooner than later.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You were clear up-front about your boundaries.", "NTA.  Everyone made an agreement from the get go.  Al is just freeloading at this point.", "NTA allergy meds exist", "NTA.  You made a commitment to the dog (and the shelter) when you adopted it.  You made it clear that the dog was staying before the brother moved in.  All you did here was set some specific boundaries and then stuck to them.\n\nPeople who treat pets as simply possessions really piss me off.", "NTA. I have a severe allergy to dogs, and I would never ask someone who is doing me a favor by letting me live with them to put their dog in a shelter. Their house, their rules, I am just a guest.", "NTA\n\nYou were right to put your foot down. If you\u2019re living on the good will of others, you should be careful about demands.\n\nThis was no reason to re-home your dog. Bo is family more than Ann or her brother. \n\nPrioritize family!", "NTA - You did what was right.", "NTA.\n\nThe dog lives there and is part of your family.\n\nIf his allergies are that bad, he needs to move. Clearly, he should live with Ann since she's that CONCERNED about it.\n\nShe and he are both entitled.", "NTA, you gotta do what you gotta do. Obviously Ann was not as important to you as you thought. Nothing like a crisis to clarify that. It sucks for Ann and her brother, but in the end you're both better off without each other probably.", "NTA Al knew what he was moving into, and accepted it. If it's a problem now, he needs to leave. It's that simple.", "NTA Ann showed you who she really was with how lenient she was with her brother, and how she preferred her brother ruining your home over your beloved pet. Bullet dodged imo. Also, PET TAX!", "NTA\n\nBo sounds like an awesome roommate!", "NTA, give Bo some extra snacks for helping to get a clear picture of the people you invited into your home, he saved you a buttload of time in a shitty relationship..", "NTA. It would be different if it was your partner who had the allergy or if someone who already permanently lived with you suddenly developed a severe allergy. However, Al was couch surfing with you and you were doing him a favor, you made it clear that you had a dog from the start and that the dog was not going anywhere. He chose to move in knowing this and agreed. There is no reason he needs to live with you, he\u2019s an adult who is responsible for his own housing. It\u2019s absurd for him to make even suggestions, let alone demands, about anything related to your household because it\u2019s none of his business. You\u2019ve learned the hard way why you should never let someone couch surf as a favor, and it sounds like it\u2019s for the best this relationship ended.", "NTA\n\nAl was a hassle and should have been kicked out anyway. Ann wouldn't like to be kicked out because Bo was alergic to her, so why should Bo be kicked out if Ann's brother was alergic to Bo.\n\nAlso cool dog name", "Yeah, absolutely NTA.  I'll never understand how so many people consider pets \"things\" that can just be disposed of when they are an inconvenience.  I feel like this kind of thing (\"You need to get rid of pet because X reason\") comes up way too often and it's really sad.", "NTA- I would dump my fianc\u00e9 so fast if he even mentioned rehoming our cats.", "Definitely NTA. Never in my life would I rather leave my dog homeless than my partners sibling who has made no effort to get himself out of the situation he\u2019s ended up in. Dogs are like our children, especially when they have gotten us through hard times, they deserve the same unconditional love and loyalty that they give to us. Anyone that would ask their partner to put their dog in a shelter rather than being stern with her brother and help him find a job and new place to live ASAP doesn\u2019t deserve to be accommodated for either. \ud83d\udea9", "Bo would never ask you to throw out someone you love for some freeloader. You chose well.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Like at all.", "NTA. Yeah, they can both fuck off.", "NTA. Your parents and sister are awful for even suggesting you should have considered it.", "NTA. You stated clearly that getting rid of the dog was never an option. Your dog, your house, your rules. \n\nIf you love Amy/Ann, and she loved you back, the respect of boundaries, such as *We Are Keeping the Dog* would be without question. Her regard was toward her brother and his allergies, and not towards you and your love for this dog. \n\nIt might be better to just consider this a hill to die on and move on. You love your pet, and your partner should also love him just as much, and not immediately suggest the shelter instead of asking a friend/family first. \n\nYour parents I think just want to help with some damage control, because they don\u2019t want you to ruin your relationship over a pet. But, if Bo is that worth it, and your feelings towards Ann/Amy have shifted, then don\u2019t worry about their suggestions. Just tell them that it\u2019s a deal breaker and you deserve better.", "Absolutely NTA. stick with Bo", "NTA. You were clear from the beginning that you would not be getting rid of Bo. You did the right thing here. Honestly, I don\u2019t like people that talk about pets like this.. \u201cchoosing a dog over your family\u201d no, your dog IS your family and you are your dog\u2019s family. Anyone who just nonchalantly suggests getting rid of your dog isn\u2019t okay in my book. That\u2019s a huge decision.", "NTA\n\nShe showed you her true colors with this situation. Her brother is a freeloader who seemed to have no intention of finding a job and was content to live off you for free. Hard to believe she could look past how much of a slob he is and be okay with it. Asking you to bring your dog to the shelter is outlandish, pets ARE family too. \n\nSorry it ended up this way as you sounded like you really did love her, but bullet dodged.", "NTA  he was never going to look for a job and move out. Good for you.", "Let me get this straight-\n\nYour family suggested you should re-home Bo to accommodate a deadbeat?\n\nNo offense, but what the heck is wrong with your family?\n\nAnyway, glad someone has their priorities straight.\n\nGet rid of the deadbeat and his entitled sister. Keep the dog.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Giving up your dog (who IS a family member) is not a demand anyone should make. Giving him up for a lazy mooching slob who is neither a friend nor relation? Immediate hard no. And both Ann and Al were sponging off you. Maybe they're not talking to their parents because the parents got tired of funding them.  NTA.", "NTA, it is absolutely ridiculous that he was being a freeloader and expected you to get rid of your dog. I think you\u2019re well rid of both of them.", "NTA. And might I add that if his allergies got worse, maybe cleaning the garbage out of his room might have helped.", "NTA. When you're staying as a guest at someone's home, it's implied you adjust to their living situation not the other way around. Homie isn't even paying rent or chipping in on food so there's even less leverage on his part. \n\nI don't necessarily blame your gf for taking her brothers side, she doesn't seem to be the type of person who really bonds with dogs and it seems she underestimated the importance your dog holds to you. So asking you to part ways with him isn't really fair to you. Throwing out that ultimatum to her to move out seems rash, but if you drew your line in the sand then it is what it is. You two simply have different values and outlooks that may not be compatible in the long run. \n\nMaybe finding this out sooner rather than later is for the best for all parties, imo.", "NTA\n\nBo was there first. You made an accommodation for Ann's leech brother. Allergy meds exist for a reason. If she wants to enable her brother, she can go and do it elsewhere.\n\nSo many animals have their lives upended for crap like this.  I'm glad OP chose the dog.\n\nAlso, I don't think her brother was going to be there temporarily if Ann wanted to get rid of the dog. I guess the brother was meant to be a pet or something since he didn't contribute at all.", "NTA\n\nConsider this the universe's way of telling you that you were wasting your time with this woman\n\nYou can do better OP", "NTA. Pets are family", "Never give up your pet for a woman. I had dogs growing up. The first clue of the relationship was going to end poorly. Is if my dog did not like the girl I was with.", "NTA. Bo should come first, because Ann and her brother are the assholes. I'm rather shocked that your own family doesn't have your back here. I would be horrified if one of my kids gave up their dog to accommodate a freeloader.", "NTA !  You definitely made the right call.  Give Bo a pet for me!", "Nta. Al is a grown man who came into Bo\u2019s house. The audacity to not contribute and ask someone to get rid of their pet.", "NTA -- never give up a beloved pet for a relationship.\n\nBack when I was married to my now exwife, we have 3 cats.  Most of her family is allergic to cats.  The kids and I love the cats.  \n\nBut her mom was getting old and she told me that, \"When the time comes and my mother can no longer live alone, she will be moving in with us.\"  I said, \"She allergic to cats.  So there has to be another solution.\"  My exwife said, \"There are shelters.\"  And I said, \"Wow, you'd put your mom in a shelter?  Well, gotta do what you gotta do.\"  \n\nAnd fast forward a few years later, we got divorce for that and a bunch of other reasons.  Today?  My and the kids love the cats.  And my exwife lives with her mom and takes care of her 24x7.  Everyone wins!", "NTA, but your girlfriend and family are.", "NTA and good man!", "NTA. Al's allergies probably came from his own filthy habits as much as from your dog. And you are right, he is not \"fffaaammmiiilllyyy\". Maybe you dodged a bullet there. Ann should have understood and she should not stand up for her brother, when he doesn't contribute to anything but mess and bad smells.", "You are literally the only good person in this story. Anyone who views dogs as expendable is not worth keeping around. \n\nNTA.", "Nope. NTA. Im not even a dog person and I'd rather live with Bo over Al any day.", "NTA - Wow, talk about a sense of entitlement! The dog lives there, THEY DONT. It's as easy as that.\n\nFrankly anyone that felt the dog should be forced out of his own home I would be low contact with, parents and sister included. They are prioritizing the wrong thing and frankly I wouldn't entirely trust their judgement at all after that.\n\nAt least with the dog you get something in return... love, trust, attention, affection, following the house rule you set for it... You cant say the same for your GF and her spoiled brother.\n\nYou and the dog both dodged a bullet, hopefully your next GF will love you enough to understand you are a package deal :)", "NTA and I don't agree with your parents and sister. It's your home and Al knew the score before he moved in. You are under no obligation to accommodate him, and it sounds like a good move that you got him out of the house.", "NTA\n\nAl needs to get a job and move out. He shouldn\u2019t be in your home for so long without contributing something - time, money, body (hey, whatever you\u2019re into).", "NTA. Aside from the dog issue, which I agree with you 100% on, Al was a sucky \"roommate\". I don't blame you at all. He moved in KNOWING there was a dog, who was there first, and then proceeded to take advantage of your good will.", "NTA - Bo is your boy and you made a commitment to him. You made the boundaries clear, and they were ignored. You made the right call as much as it sucks.", "Nta. It\u2019s hard now that you are in it but whenever someone comes to stay for an indefinite time it\u2019s a nightmare. Always try to set a time limit in advance and also outline the household responsibilities you expect. \n\nIt sounds like you and Ann have broken up. It sucks but at least you know now that she won\u2019t prioritise you which would have caused problems eventually without al in the picture", "You made the right choice..NTA not even one bit!!", "NTA!  Your priorities are in the right place!  Your parents should be supporting you.  Good riddance to gf and her toxic brother!  Stay strong!", "NTA\n\nEven if Bo wasn't in the picture, Als behavior was enough to kick him out.", "NTA. I can't even believe you let this grown man move in with you! I'm glad you stood your ground though. Def not the a hole here", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. You would\u2019ve been it if you did out Bo in the shelter though.Good job standing your ground!", "NTA, they disrespected your boundaries and your connection with your beloved dog, his behavior and her enabling of his behavior are both pretty toxic considering everyone is in their 20's. Best of luck going forward", "NTA. You were being asked to, and being chastised for not, prioritizing a lazy, messy, arrogant, entitled being you are not related to over a loyal friend you are legally related to. Hands down, no contest over who goes.", "NTA it was a condition of him moving in that they would not expect you to give up your dog.\n\nHe contributed nothing positive to your home and gave you more work to do, if anything. For you to be expected to give up your dog for someone like that is ridiculous.\n\nSince they persisted once you said Bo would absolutely not be leaving, you were not an AH in my opinion for asking them to leave.\n\nBut, even though the words may not have been said, your relationship is definitely over.", "NTA   Brother isn't your family and Ann made clear her priority was her brother and not you.  Maintain your boundaries and find someone better :)", "NTA. freeloaders have to go. The dog has a job and that is to be your best friend. Good for you.", "NTA the brother is a brown adult he can find his own way and sorry but getting rid of pets is a hard stop, it\u2019s not going to happen", "NTA\n\nAlways choose the pets over, well pretty much everything. Good job OP!\n\nEdited to add: a girlfriend who loved you would never have asked you to get rid of Bo. If she does contact you, I\u2019d carefully consider weather you want this relationship to continue.", "NTA. It sounds like you dodged a bullet tbh", "NTA and I'm happy you through away the real problems rather your dog! A real partner will never tell you to rid of your dog for a selfish way, you save yourself ! You don't need to speak to officialize the break up so I encourage you to change the lock in case she will do something to Bo or steal anything ,put her stuff on bags and send her a message telling her to come take her things in a specific day! Make sure someone is there with you in case she want to make a scene or she come with her brother and create a fight!", "Nta. Your well done in getting rid of the pair of them", "NTA you did the right thing! Pets are family!", "NTA.\nThat brother is the AH.", "You made a lot of mistakes along the way, esp letting this slacker move in with you.  But you're definitely NTA.  You're surrounded by them, though.\n\nAlso, as a dog lover, I would probably end this relationship.  It's one thing if she \"tolerates\" the dog just because she has to.  But to suggest dumping him in a shelter because a slacker in YOUR home has a  mild allergy is a big character defect imo.", "NTA, this was all discussed prior to his moving in and your gf and her brother need to accept that.  Maybe his allergies are bad because he\u2019s a pig", "I have a severe, severe dander/pet allergy and you are 100% NTA.", "NTA. This shows you that she views Bo as an object. Do with that info what you will. But I\u2019d be very hesitant to let her move back in, \u201coh he ran out the door past me\u201d comes up way too much lately. Sounds like y\u2019all have different values and are just not compatible", "NTA. \n\nListen, if Al was being a productive member of the household, was actively job hunting and was being a good roommate but his allergies were off the hook, I would probably say him and Ann were being reasonable in asking if the dog could stay somewhere else. That would be a case of looking out for family.\n\nBut Al is not being any of those things and suggesting a shelter before temporary housing was the lowest blow. Al is not acting like family, unless he's magically become your surly 12 year old son. \n\nChances are that Al's \"allergies\" are actually from mould growing in his room with all those old food wrappers and dishes.", "NTA - Although I think you went a little overboard instead of being calm but I get it, probably was time to snap. I realize you didnt ask this, but if you love Bo as much as you do, your gf doesnt seem to have the same feelings. Maybe it was time to realize she doesnt respect that relationship.", "NTA it\u2019s your home, and the dog is family. I have dog allergies as well, and Claritin works like a charm for it. Maybe you could suggest it to the brother? I\u2019m sure there is a compromise you can all come to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ann asked if Al could stay with us and I didn\u2019t see why not. Ann isn\u2019t on speaking terms with her parents and I assumed Al probably also wasn\u2019t and didn\u2019t have another place to go. Plus I really loved Ann and I wanted to show her how important she was to me.\n\nHere is the issue: Ann told me Al had a mild dog allergy. When I initially spoke with both of them I said I would do my best to accommodate but would not, under any circumstances, get rid of Bo. Both understood and Al said his allergy wasn\u2019t too bad.\n\nAl moved in and to be honest he wasn\u2019t a great roommate. He didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to move out, as he spent most of his time sleeping and playing video games instead of looking for work. He didn\u2019t pitch in for chores and let laundry pile up in his room, then acted confused when I told him he had to do his own laundry. He ate the food we cooked but did not help with cooking or buying groceries. Worst, he ordered lots of fast food for himself and left wrappers, bags, and old food in his room which made the whole apartment smell.\u00a0\n\nAfter a month or so, Al said his allergies were getting worse and asked me to consider putting Bo in a shelter. I said absolutely not, but\u00a0 Ann said we should consider getting rid of Bo to accommodate her brother\u2019s needs. I said no and we would not be discussing this further. She called me TA for \u201cchoosing my dog over my family.\u201d  \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s when I snapped. I said Al is not family and he has been nothing but a hassle for the past month, and that if she wants to babysit her older brother she can find her own place. She has no legal right to stay here because my name is on the lease and I pay rent (Ann is in grad school and does not make enough money to afford a decent apartment on her own). She tried again to convince me that I should prioritize Al over Bo, so I gave her an ultimatum. Either Al is gone in twenty-four hours or I kick BOTH of them out. Bo stays no matter what. Both have since moved out, and while Ann and I are not officially broken up, I haven\u2019t heard from her in a few days.\n\nI know this may sound harsh but Bo IS my family. He has been with me through some of my hardest times and he is a rescue, which means he was already abandoned once, and I will NOT let that happen again. I feel nothing for Al and, while I thought I loved Ann, her willingness to get rid of someone I love as much as her, made my feelings change. When I explained this to my parents and sister, however, they said I should have at least considered getting rid of Bo to accommodate Al, and that they could even take care of Bo themselves so he didn\u2019t have to go to a shelter. They said if I saw Ann as family, which I did at one point, I should be able to make sacrifices. But that was a sacrifice I wasn\u2019t willing to make. Does that make me TA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You would be one if you keep her around. Get rid of them both and keep the dog", "NTA... Her wanting you to let her brother mooch off you, while contributing nothing, is pure red flag.", "NTA. That is Bo's home and he's family. Kick your girlfriend's loser brother out, and ditch her. Because man, she sucks.\n\nKeep Bo and be happy.", "NTA You did the right thing.", "I was going to say say N T A and you aren't one for not rehoming your dog but you are almost certainly legally wrong as well as an AH for: \n\n\n>She has no legal right to stay here\n\nAlmost everywhere would require a legal eviction for anyone who has stayed more than 30 days at an address and receives mail at that address (which also would include him too unfortunately). Furthermore,  you can say no and stand firm on that no without threatening your partners home stability over it and holding it over her head that you pay rent when presumably that was an agreement you both came too. Though you'd be well within your right to end the relationship with someone that clearly can't set boundaries with their brother and whose values clearly don't align.", "NTA about Bo, but around here, everyone is hiring (yes, not great jobs but min. wage full time jobs). Al has no job and (apparently) no savings, what made you think that Al moving in would end well? I almost judged you TA for being so blindly optimistic.", "NTA. Bo was there first, it's his home and you're his family. Good for you for defending your little doggo.", "NTA\n\nClear, conscise boundaries given..... lazy freeloader..... \n\nDoggo comes 1st", "NTA. I\u2019d do the same thing with my dog. He comes first, no way I\u2019d be getting rid of him to accommodate someone else.\n\nYour parent\u2019s suggestion that they could watch him for you is reasonable\u2026if you knew it was going to be a fixed time. Like if Al was showing any signs of wanting to get a new job and getting out, taking your dog to your parents for a few weeks would be a great solution. But considering his total lack of drive to get out and Ann\u2019s lack of caring, it sounds pretty open ended and you can\u2019t just leave your dog at your parents indefinitely.", "NTA. Everyone has boundaries and things that they refuse to budge on. When I got with my partner I flat out told him, we would likely always have a dog- my pets were my family, and if he wasn't okay have pets we wouldn't work. You made it clear the dog was staying. It's hard for animals to adjust when rehomed especially if they've been with someone for a long time. Al was making no move to do anything but take advantage- so why should you make any moves to make it easier on him? If he was trying to move out, and asked if the dog could be sent to your family's for a few weeks while he saved - he would have been okay at least asking. But even then you would have had every right to say no. Also honestly his allergies were probably acting up partially because the state he was keeping his room.", "NTA. Never will be, kudos for sticking to your boundaries. Reminds me on an old saying. Those that matter, don\u2019t care, those that care, don\u2019t matter.", "NTA - Al is a freeloader and your STBxGF is an enabler.  You did the right thing lightening the load.", "I\u2019m not even a huge fan of dogs but I would definitely pick Bo over the other two. They suck! NTA.", "NTA. You were clear and your ex and her brother thought that once he was living with you, he could get you to get rid of the dog. You are right to be done with both of them.", "NTA.\n\nYou did see her as family. If she saw you as family, she never would have asked you to send your dog to a shelter. Wtf was wrong with her? Seems more like she always wanted your dog gone. \n\nGood riddance I say. Find you someone thats gonna snuggle and play with your dog. Who embraces animals as part of the family.", "She awoke the John Wick in you. NTA.", "NTA I would have done exactly the same. Gf ist heartless and delusional.", "My wife's sister is allergic to cats, as is my Father in Law. Guess who didn't get rid of his cat when he got married.\n\nNTA.\n\nGF should have spoken to her brother about his behavior. Brother then could have continued his bad behavior elsewhere OR gotten his shit together when a stranger started housing him. No clue why the GF bounced if she can't afford a place on her own, and didn't seem to have any other issue besides the freeloading brother.", "I consider anytime anyone asks you to get rid of an animal that isn't physically hurting anyone to be a red flag. (Like if your dog was biting people that's different.) To just ask someone to basically get rid of something they love for some dude they barely know shows a lack of empathy of the gfs part. The brother can mooch off someone else if he's that allergic. NTA", "NTA + dodged a bullet", "NTA.  Al is a moocher, and Ann is his enabler.", "NTA 100%", "NTA. Bo is family and you made yourself clear in the beginning.\n\nBut you may want to consider whether or not you see yourself with this girl long-term if she cannot accept that Bo is family..", "ABSOLUTELY NTA. And you took the right decision. Never betray a dog for anyone else. Specially people like your gf and her brother are not worthy at all. Your gf is entitled and so her brother is. Bo actually rescued from bad people like them who just wanted to mooch you off! Your bio family is jealous of Bo because you value him more than them. So don\u2019t listen to anyone just stick with your decision and never let your gf come back again. She will be acting vengeful against innocent Bo which you will never know!", "NTA. You were compassionate to let him stay. You also communicated your boundaries. They were being choosing beggars and got too choosy.\n\nBtw they actually *do* have legal rights to stay. If someone is a resident, you have to go through an eviction process. But they left already so that was avoided.\n\nI\u2019m curious where they went\u2026 \ud83e\udd14", "ESH\n\nGetting rid of your dog is an unfair ask. However, your girlfriend lives with you. It is her home too even if the arrangement you have together is that she doesn't pay rent or other costs. It's completely unreasonable to hold whose on the lease over her head instead of having a mature conversation about how this situation isn't working. Moreover, while Al isn't your family, he is hers and if this is a serious relationship, you could do with putting some more weight into that.", "Agreed! If someone asked me to get rid of my dog, it would be an automatic dealbreaker. What utter nonsense. Anyone who thinks that is a reasonable request is not a person you want to continue dating.", "Nta. Agreed, I have mild algergies and two cats I adore. Blessings to the good people at Zyrtec.", "This. NTA op", "I think you meant \u201cgrown\u201d instead of \u201cbrown\u201d autocomplete? and yeah , bro is a grown ass adult who is freeloading off OP. A dog is a family member.", "Even if he was all of that, it still wouldn\u2019t be reasonable. It\u2019s *his* place and his dog was there before any of them. It is absolutely unreasonable even if he was an acceptable roommate, because it\u2019s supposed to be temporary AND he knew what he was walking into. Rehoming a dog because a TEMPORARY guest doesnt want to take his antihistamines like he knew he\u2019d have to is not reasonable under any circumstances.", "I mean I don\u2019t see how he wasn\u2019t calm? He calmly told her to get tf out if she had an issue with the dog being there. Honestly there isn\u2019t much else he could do in this situation.", "I have to disagree he went overboard.  At the first sign that some loser in my home wanted me to dump MY dog, I have all sorts of ways of making it clear he's not to mention this again unless he wants his crap on the lawn!", "I agree with you in theory. \n\nBut I think OP is better off without Ann and Al. The only compromise he should even think about is letting Ann apologize and then ask to come back without her millstone of a brother.\n\nThen OP should tell her no. He can find someone who appreciates him and Bo.", "Hell no, she showed her true colours when she picked getting rid of the dog over kicking out her moocher slob of a brother.", "Are... Are you the ex girlfriend?", "Yes , I hate my autocorrect\u2026."]}
