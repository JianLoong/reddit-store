Ann asked if Al could stay with us and I didn\u2019t see why not. Ann isn\u2019t on speaking terms with her parents and I assumed Al probably also wasn\u2019t and didn\u2019t have another place to go. Plus I really loved Ann and I wanted to show her how important she was to me.\n\nHere is the issue: Ann told me Al had a mild dog allergy. When I initially spoke with both of them I said I would do my best to accommodate but would not, under any circumstances, get rid of Bo. Both understood and Al said his allergy wasn\u2019t too bad.\n\nAl moved in and to be honest he wasn\u2019t a great roommate. He didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to move out, as he spent most of his time sleeping and playing video games instead of looking for work. He didn\u2019t pitch in for chores and let laundry pile up in his room, then acted confused when I told him he had to do his own laundry. He ate the food we cooked but did not help with cooking or buying groceries. Worst, he ordered lots of fast food for himself and left wrappers, bags, and old food in his room which made the whole apartment smell.\u00a0\n\nAfter a month or so, Al said his allergies were getting worse and asked me to consider putting Bo in a shelter. I said absolutely not, but\u00a0 Ann said we should consider getting rid of Bo to accommodate her brother\u2019s needs. I said no and we would not be discussing this further. She called me TA for \u201cchoosing my dog over my family.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when I snapped. I said Al is not family and he has been nothing but a hassle for the past month, and that if she wants to babysit her older brother she can find her own place. She has no legal right to stay here because my name is on the lease and I pay rent (Ann is in grad school and does not make enough money to afford a decent apartment on her own). She tried again to convince me that I should prioritize Al over Bo, so I gave her an ultimatum. Either Al is gone in twenty-four hours or I kick BOTH of them out. Bo stays no matter what. Both have since moved out, and while Ann and I are not officially broken up, I haven\u2019t heard from her in a few days.\n\nI know this may sound harsh but Bo IS my family. He has been with me through some of my hardest times and he is a rescue, which means he was already abandoned once, and I will NOT let that happen again. I feel nothing for Al and, while I thought I loved Ann, her willingness to get rid of someone I love as much as her, made my feelings change. When I explained this to my parents and sister, however, they said I should have at least considered getting rid of Bo to accommodate Al, and that they could even take care of Bo themselves so he didn\u2019t have to go to a shelter. They said if I saw Ann as family, which I did at one point, I should be able to make sacrifices. But that was a sacrifice I wasn\u2019t willing to make. Does that make me TA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Lol I realized I used both \"Amy\" and \"Ann\" for my gf's name. (None are her real name.)

Kicking her out was breaking up with her, and good for you! She's clearly heartless to consider putting your dog in a shelter for a lame roommate who could've taken an allergy pill.", "NTA, if she loves you she never would have asked you to get rid of your dog.  She\u2019s prioritizing her brother over you, and your feelings.  You\u2019re probably better off just moving on, and finding someone who wants the same things out of life.  \n\nYour family is also wrong, and I\u2019m honestly not sure why they would take her side.  Some people just don\u2019t care as much about animals, which is very sad.  Animals are better than most people I\u2019ve met.", "NTA\n\n\"He didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to move out, as he spent most of his time sleeping and playing video games instead of looking for work. He didn\u2019t pitch in for chores and let laundry pile up in his room, then acted confused when I told him he had to do his own laundry. He ate the food we cooked but did not help with cooking or buying groceries. \" - so far no difference in behaviour between him and Bo.  Then we get to \"Worst, he ordered lots of fast food for himself and left wrappers, bags, and old food in his room which made the whole apartment smell.\" - Bo is housetrained to not make a mess and is far less hassle!\n\nWise choice - Bo is far more loyal and less demanding!", "NTA. You made your stance known before Al moved in. He's just mooching and taking advantage of you.", "NTA.\n\nThe arrangement was supposed to be temporary. It wouldn\u2019t matter if he was the best roommate on the planet, rehoming a dog for a temporary guest who knew what he was walking I to and agreed to it, makes zero sense and is completely unacceptable. \n\nPets aren\u2019t disposable. I get some people don\u2019t see them as apart of the family, but for a pet, their owner is their family. Their owner is the only family most of them got. \n\nDon\u2019t let your family guilt you about sacrifices. You don\u2019t sacrifice family because someone else is to lazy to take his antihistamines. Again, this was a TEMPORARY thing. Why In the world would you rehome your dog so a temporary guest could further take over your apartment?", "NtA . Bo is your family and he predates both of the other players in this scenario. Ann and Al both knew your dog was not an option that was ever on the table. Ann's willingness to get rid of your companion over what is supposed to be a temporary living arrangement is telling .", "NTA - You made your conditions about Bo clear from the start and Al's stay was always meant to be temporary (at least as far as you were told). It is better you know now that Ann is willing to overlook this type of behavior from her brother and willing to go back on her word if he asks her to. How to deal with family members in these types of situations is a common issue of compatibility in relationships. \n\nYou DID make a sacrifice for your GF - you let him move into your apartment in the first place. Al is not a young child who needed a home. He was an adult who felt entitled to mooch off you with no end in site while expecting you to accommodate his every wish. Putting up with his atrocious behavior was too much to ask. Being willing to make a sacrifice for family is not the same as letting them walk all over you - which is what Al AND Ann were trying to do.", "NTA. If Ann loved you, she wouldn't have asked you to re\u2013home your dog for her ne'er\u2013do\u2013well brother. Congratulations, and it looks like you dodged a bullet!", "NTA, Ann and Al sound exhausting and entitled.  Our fur babies are family.", "NTA, you did the right thing. Whilst I understand your family are trying to be helpful, they don\u2019t seem to have very good boundaries. You don\u2019t move into a family member\u2019s home and then demand that they get rid of their pet. My own sister wouldn\u2019t do that to me. It\u2019s not something you ever ask of someone you love. It\u2019s a shame Ann might have been bullied into supporting her brother, but that\u2019s not your responsibility.", "Wtf is wrong with these people? Pets ARE Family and are not disposable! You were 100% right on this, absolutely NTA \n\nYou were not being unreasonable at all.. if there was one thing I\u2019d have done if it was me is that I\u2019d have talked to Ann previously and told her that Al was being lazy and he should help more with the chores (so that she could speak with him, since she is her sister), but you acted perfectly in regards to Bo", "How long was Ann planning on letting Al stay with you guys? I mean, if you actually had agreed to let the dog go. Rehoming a pet is not something you do for a few weeks, I would think. \n\nSounds to me she / they were planning on him living there forever. Very strange, especially since he was behaving very badly as a roommate.\n\nGood move, OP, I think this girl was not right for you and it was better you found out sooner than later.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You were clear up-front about your boundaries.", "NTA.  Everyone made an agreement from the get go.  Al is just freeloading at this point.", "NTA allergy meds exist", "NTA.  You made a commitment to the dog (and the shelter) when you adopted it.  You made it clear that the dog was staying before the brother moved in.  All you did here was set some specific boundaries and then stuck to them.\n\nPeople who treat pets as simply possessions really piss me off.", "NTA. I have a severe allergy to dogs, and I would never ask someone who is doing me a favor by letting me live with them to put their dog in a shelter. Their house, their rules, I am just a guest.", "NTA\n\nYou were right to put your foot down. If you\u2019re living on the good will of others, you should be careful about demands.\n\nThis was no reason to re-home your dog. Bo is family more than Ann or her brother. \n\nPrioritize family!", "NTA - You did what was right.", "NTA.\n\nThe dog lives there and is part of your family.\n\nIf his allergies are that bad, he needs to move. Clearly, he should live with Ann since she's that CONCERNED about it.\n\nShe and he are both entitled.", "NTA, you gotta do what you gotta do. Obviously Ann was not as important to you as you thought. Nothing like a crisis to clarify that. It sucks for Ann and her brother, but in the end you're both better off without each other probably.", "NTA Al knew what he was moving into, and accepted it. If it's a problem now, he needs to leave. It's that simple.", "NTA Ann showed you who she really was with how lenient she was with her brother, and how she preferred her brother ruining your home over your beloved pet. Bullet dodged imo. Also, PET TAX!", "NTA\n\nBo sounds like an awesome roommate!", "NTA, give Bo some extra snacks for helping to get a clear picture of the people you invited into your home, he saved you a buttload of time in a shitty relationship..", "NTA. It would be different if it was your partner who had the allergy or if someone who already permanently lived with you suddenly developed a severe allergy. However, Al was couch surfing with you and you were doing him a favor, you made it clear that you had a dog from the start and that the dog was not going anywhere. He chose to move in knowing this and agreed. There is no reason he needs to live with you, he\u2019s an adult who is responsible for his own housing. It\u2019s absurd for him to make even suggestions, let alone demands, about anything related to your household because it\u2019s none of his business. You\u2019ve learned the hard way why you should never let someone couch surf as a favor, and it sounds like it\u2019s for the best this relationship ended.", "NTA\n\nAl was a hassle and should have been kicked out anyway. Ann wouldn't like to be kicked out because Bo was alergic to her, so why should Bo be kicked out if Ann's brother was alergic to Bo.\n\nAlso cool dog name", "Yeah, absolutely NTA.  I'll never understand how so many people consider pets \"things\" that can just be disposed of when they are an inconvenience.  I feel like this kind of thing (\"You need to get rid of pet because X reason\") comes up way too often and it's really sad.", "NTA- I would dump my fianc\u00e9 so fast if he even mentioned rehoming our cats.", "Definitely NTA. Never in my life would I rather leave my dog homeless than my partners sibling who has made no effort to get himself out of the situation he\u2019s ended up in. Dogs are like our children, especially when they have gotten us through hard times, they deserve the same unconditional love and loyalty that they give to us. Anyone that would ask their partner to put their dog in a shelter rather than being stern with her brother and help him find a job and new place to live ASAP doesn\u2019t deserve to be accommodated for either. \ud83d\udea9", "Bo would never ask you to throw out someone you love for some freeloader. You chose well.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Like at all.", "NTA. Yeah, they can both fuck off.", "NTA. Your parents and sister are awful for even suggesting you should have considered it.", "NTA. You stated clearly that getting rid of the dog was never an option. Your dog, your house, your rules. \n\nIf you love Amy/Ann, and she loved you back, the respect of boundaries, such as *We Are Keeping the Dog* would be without question. Her regard was toward her brother and his allergies, and not towards you and your love for this dog. \n\nIt might be better to just consider this a hill to die on and move on. You love your pet, and your partner should also love him just as much, and not immediately suggest the shelter instead of asking a friend/family first. \n\nYour parents I think just want to help with some damage control, because they don\u2019t want you to ruin your relationship over a pet. But, if Bo is that worth it, and your feelings towards Ann/Amy have shifted, then don\u2019t worry about their suggestions. Just tell them that it\u2019s a deal breaker and you deserve better.", "Absolutely NTA. stick with Bo", "NTA. You were clear from the beginning that you would not be getting rid of Bo. You did the right thing here. Honestly, I don\u2019t like people that talk about pets like this.. \u201cchoosing a dog over your family\u201d no, your dog IS your family and you are your dog\u2019s family. Anyone who just nonchalantly suggests getting rid of your dog isn\u2019t okay in my book. That\u2019s a huge decision.", "NTA\n\nShe showed you her true colors with this situation. Her brother is a freeloader who seemed to have no intention of finding a job and was content to live off you for free. Hard to believe she could look past how much of a slob he is and be okay with it. Asking you to bring your dog to the shelter is outlandish, pets ARE family too. \n\nSorry it ended up this way as you sounded like you really did love her, but bullet dodged.", "NTA  he was never going to look for a job and move out. Good for you.", "Let me get this straight-\n\nYour family suggested you should re-home Bo to accommodate a deadbeat?\n\nNo offense, but what the heck is wrong with your family?\n\nAnyway, glad someone has their priorities straight.\n\nGet rid of the deadbeat and his entitled sister. Keep the dog.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Giving up your dog (who IS a family member) is not a demand anyone should make. Giving him up for a lazy mooching slob who is neither a friend nor relation? Immediate hard no. And both Ann and Al were sponging off you. Maybe they're not talking to their parents because the parents got tired of funding them.", "NTA, it is absolutely ridiculous that he was being a freeloader and expected you to get rid of your dog. I think you\u2019re well rid of both of them.", "NTA. And might I add that if his allergies got worse, maybe cleaning the garbage out of his room might have helped.", "NTA. When you're staying as a guest at someone's home, it's implied you adjust to their living situation not the other way around. Homie isn't even paying rent or chipping in on food so there's even less leverage on his part. \n\nI don't necessarily blame your gf for taking her brothers side, she doesn't seem to be the type of person who really bonds with dogs and it seems she underestimated the importance your dog holds to you. So asking you to part ways with him isn't really fair to you. Throwing out that ultimatum to her to move out seems rash, but if you drew your line in the sand then it is what it is. You two simply have different values and outlooks that may not be compatible in the long run. \n\nMaybe finding this out sooner rather than later is for the best for all parties, imo.", "NTA\n\nBo was there first. You made an accommodation for Ann's leech brother. Allergy meds exist for a reason. If she wants to enable her brother, she can go and do it elsewhere.\n\nSo many animals have their lives upended for crap like this.  I'm glad OP chose the dog.\n\nAlso, I don't think her brother was going to be there temporarily if Ann wanted to get rid of the dog. I guess the brother was meant to be a pet or something since he didn't contribute at all.", "NTA\n\nConsider this the universe's way of telling you that you were wasting your time with this woman\n\nYou can do better OP", "NTA. Pets are family", "Never give up your pet for a woman. I had dogs growing up. The first clue of the relationship was going to end poorly. Is if my dog did not like the girl I was with.", "NTA. Bo should come first, because Ann and her brother are the assholes. I'm rather shocked that your own family doesn't have your back here. I would be horrified if one of my kids gave up their dog to accommodate a freeloader.", "NTA !  You definitely made the right call.  Give Bo a pet for me!", "Nta. Al is a grown man who came into Bo\u2019s house. The audacity to not contribute and ask someone to get rid of their pet.", "NTA -- never give up a beloved pet for a relationship.\n\nBack when I was married to my now exwife, we have 3 cats.  Most of her family is allergic to cats.  The kids and I love the cats.  \n\nBut her mom was getting old and she told me that, \"When the time comes and my mother can no longer live alone, she will be moving in with us.\"  I said, \"She allergic to cats.  So there has to be another solution.\"  My exwife said, \"There are shelters.\"  And I said, \"Wow, you'd put your mom in a shelter?  Well, gotta do what you gotta do.\"  \n\nAnd fast forward a few years later, we got divorce for that and a bunch of other reasons.  Today?  My and the kids love the cats.  And my exwife lives with her mom and takes care of her 24x7.  Everyone wins!", "NTA, but your girlfriend and family are.", "NTA and good man!", "NTA. Al's allergies probably came from his own filthy habits as much as from your dog. And you are right, he is not \"fffaaammmiiilllyyy\". Maybe you dodged a bullet there. Ann should have understood and she should not stand up for her brother, when he doesn't contribute to anything but mess and bad smells.", "You are literally the only good person in this story. Anyone who views dogs as expendable is not worth keeping around. \n\nNTA.", "Nope. NTA. Im not even a dog person and I'd rather live with Bo over Al any day.", "NTA - Wow, talk about a sense of entitlement! The dog lives there, THEY DONT. It's as easy as that.\n\nFrankly anyone that felt the dog should be forced out of his own home I would be low contact with, parents and sister included. They are prioritizing the wrong thing and frankly I wouldn't entirely trust their judgement at all after that.\n\nAt least with the dog you get something in return... love, trust, attention, affection, following the house rule you set for it... You cant say the same for your GF and her spoiled brother.\n\nYou and the dog both dodged a bullet, hopefully your next GF will love you enough to understand you are a package deal :)", "NTA and I don't agree with your parents and sister. It's your home and Al knew the score before he moved in. You are under no obligation to accommodate him, and it sounds like a good move that you got him out of the house.", "NTA\n\nAl needs to get a job and move out. He shouldn\u2019t be in your home for so long without contributing something - time, money, body (hey, whatever you\u2019re into).", "NTA. Aside from the dog issue, which I agree with you 100% on, Al was a sucky \"roommate\". I don't blame you at all. He moved in KNOWING there was a dog, who was there first, and then proceeded to take advantage of your good will.", "NTA - Bo is your boy and you made a commitment to him. You made the boundaries clear, and they were ignored. You made the right call as much as it sucks.", "Nta. It\u2019s hard now that you are in it but whenever someone comes to stay for an indefinite time it\u2019s a nightmare. Always try to set a time limit in advance and also outline the household responsibilities you expect. \n\nIt sounds like you and Ann have broken up. It sucks but at least you know now that she won\u2019t prioritise you which would have caused problems eventually without al in the picture", "You made the right choice..NTA not even one bit!!", "NTA!  Your priorities are in the right place!  Your parents should be supporting you.  Good riddance to gf and her toxic brother!  Stay strong!", "NTA\n\nEven if Bo wasn't in the picture, Als behavior was enough to kick him out.", "NTA. I can't even believe you let this grown man move in with you! I'm glad you stood your ground though. Def not the a hole here", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. You would\u2019ve been it if you did out Bo in the shelter though.Good job standing your ground!", "NTA, they disrespected your boundaries and your connection with your beloved dog, his behavior and her enabling of his behavior are both pretty toxic considering everyone is in their 20's. Best of luck going forward", "NTA. You were being asked to, and being chastised for not, prioritizing a lazy, messy, arrogant, entitled being you are not related to over a loyal friend you are legally related to. Hands down, no contest over who goes.", "NTA it was a condition of him moving in that they would not expect you to give up your dog.\n\nHe contributed nothing positive to your home and gave you more work to do, if anything. For you to be expected to give up your dog for someone like that is ridiculous.\n\nSince they persisted once you said Bo would absolutely not be leaving, you were not an AH in my opinion for asking them to leave.\n\nBut, even though the words may not have been said, your relationship is definitely over.", "NTA   Brother isn't your family and Ann made clear her priority was her brother and not you.  Maintain your boundaries and find someone better :)", "NTA. freeloaders have to go. The dog has a job and that is to be your best friend. Good for you.", "NTA the brother is a brown adult he can find his own way and sorry but getting rid of pets is a hard stop, it\u2019s not going to happen", "NTA\n\nAlways choose the pets over, well pretty much everything. Good job OP!\n\nEdited to add: a girlfriend who loved you would never have asked you to get rid of Bo. If she does contact you, I\u2019d carefully consider weather you want this relationship to continue.", "NTA. It sounds like you dodged a bullet tbh", "NTA and I'm happy you through away the real problems rather your dog! A real partner will never tell you to rid of your dog for a selfish way, you save yourself ! You don't need to speak to officialize the break up so I encourage you to change the lock in case she will do something to Bo or steal anything ,put her stuff on bags and send her a message telling her to come take her things in a specific day! Make sure someone is there with you in case she want to make a scene or she come with her brother and create a fight!", "Nta. Your well done in getting rid of the pair of them", "NTA you did the right thing! Pets are family!", "NTA.\nThat brother is the AH.", "You made a lot of mistakes along the way, esp letting this slacker move in with you.  But you're definitely NTA.  You're surrounded by them, though.\n\nAlso, as a dog lover, I would probably end this relationship.  It's one thing if she \"tolerates\" the dog just because she has to.  But to suggest dumping him in a shelter because a slacker in YOUR home has a  mild allergy is a big character defect imo.", "NTA, this was all discussed prior to his moving in and your gf and her brother need to accept that.  Maybe his allergies are bad because he\u2019s a pig", "I have a severe, severe dander/pet allergy and you are 100% NTA.", "NTA. This shows you that she views Bo as an object. Do with that info what you will. But I\u2019d be very hesitant to let her move back in, \u201coh he ran out the door past me\u201d comes up way too much lately. Sounds like y\u2019all have different values and are just not compatible", "NTA. \n\nListen, if Al was being a productive member of the household, was actively job hunting and was being a good roommate but his allergies were off the hook, I would probably say him and Ann were being reasonable in asking if the dog could stay somewhere else. That would be a case of looking out for family.\n\nBut Al is not being any of those things and suggesting a shelter before temporary housing was the lowest blow. Al is not acting like family, unless he's magically become your surly 12 year old son. \n\nChances are that Al's \"allergies\" are actually from mould growing in his room with all those old food wrappers and dishes.", "NTA - Although I think you went a little overboard instead of being calm but I get it, probably was time to snap. I realize you didnt ask this, but if you love Bo as much as you do, your gf doesnt seem to have the same feelings. Maybe it was time to realize she doesnt respect that relationship.", "NTA it\u2019s your home, and the dog is family. I have dog allergies as well, and Claritin works like a charm for it. Maybe you could suggest it to the brother? I\u2019m sure there is a compromise you can all come to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ann asked if Al could stay with us and I didn\u2019t see why not. Ann isn\u2019t on speaking terms with her parents and I assumed Al probably also wasn\u2019t and didn\u2019t have another place to go. Plus I really loved Ann and I wanted to show her how important she was to me.\n\nHere is the issue: Ann told me Al had a mild dog allergy. When I initially spoke with both of them I said I would do my best to accommodate but would not, under any circumstances, get rid of Bo. Both understood and Al said his allergy wasn\u2019t too bad.\n\nAl moved in and to be honest he wasn\u2019t a great roommate. He didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to move out, as he spent most of his time sleeping and playing video games instead of looking for work. He didn\u2019t pitch in for chores and let laundry pile up in his room, then acted confused when I told him he had to do his own laundry. He ate the food we cooked but did not help with cooking or buying groceries. Worst, he ordered lots of fast food for himself and left wrappers, bags, and old food in his room which made the whole apartment smell.\u00a0\n\nAfter a month or so, Al said his allergies were getting worse and asked me to consider putting Bo in a shelter. I said absolutely not, but\u00a0 Ann said we should consider getting rid of Bo to accommodate her brother\u2019s needs. I said no and we would not be discussing this further. She called me TA for \u201cchoosing my dog over my family.\u201d  \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That\u2019s when I snapped. I said Al is not family and he has been nothing but a hassle for the past month, and that if she wants to babysit her older brother she can find her own place. She has no legal right to stay here because my name is on the lease and I pay rent (Ann is in grad school and does not make enough money to afford a decent apartment on her own). She tried again to convince me that I should prioritize Al over Bo, so I gave her an ultimatum. Either Al is gone in twenty-four hours or I kick BOTH of them out. Bo stays no matter what. Both have since moved out, and while Ann and I are not officially broken up, I haven\u2019t heard from her in a few days.\n\nI know this may sound harsh but Bo IS my family.

Hopefully you move on from Ann - because it sounds like if you\u2019re dating her you\u2019ll be dating Al too.", "NTA.   \n\nThank you for putting your family over that awful human of a hopefully ex girlfriend and her entitled brother.  \n\nCount your blessings that this happened before it was more difficult to break free from her.", "NTA Al living with you was supposed to be temporary. Bo is your responsibility for the rest of his life. You chose Bo and did not choose Al. GF and her brother have no right to ask you to get rid of your dog. He needs to move on like it was planned for him to do.", "NTA Al was not family, he was a leech who outstayed his welcome. Free loading leeches don't start making ultimatums to the guy on the lease, bringing in the money to pay the bills and feed them. Ann made her choice and that is on her. Your family is wrong, at the end of the day it wasn't just about your dog, it was everything.", "NTA\n\nYou told them when they asked for Al to move in that Bo was going nowhere. Too bad, so sad for them to have found out the hard way that you were dead serious. Good riddance. \n\nI can't belive your parents either. Taking your dog to a shelter (or giving  him away) because Al is too lazy to get a job and get out is not a \"sacrifice\". That's absurd.", "NTA. If you rehomed your dog Al would never have rehomed  himself. \n\nIf your gf truly loved you, she'd understand your love and devotion for Bo and would never have put you in that position (especially after you made it a hard boundary from the start).", "NTA\n\nYou handled this perfectly. Don't you dare take that woman back. She wanted your dog put back in a shelter. Remember that in the upcoming weak and lonely moments.", "NTA, like you said that dog is your family. You're doing him a favor, he doesn't get to decide if you keep your dog or not especially for an allergy that doesn't seem dangerous. My mom is also technically allergic to dogs and has asthma. Guess what, we have four of them and two of them are constantly with her. He could suck it up if he really needed the place to stay, or even get allergy pills or something.

Thos person was living in your home rent free and if Ann wasn't paying rent that means you were supporting them both. Did Ann pat extra for the utilities that her brother used? Did she even offer? It soundsike you got a glimpse of who she really is and  that she and her brother would be sure to take advantage of your kindness at every opportunity. Your family is insane to look at this situation and think it's fine to have a grown man who isn't your family in your home living rent free, making a mess. Nope, you made the right call imo", "Absolutely NTA. Pets ARE family. Would you get rid of a child if you developed an allergy to it? Never abandon a being that trusts you above all that exists, in exchange for no one's approval. And it's really worrying that your gf thinks your dog is disposable.

Go find someone actually worthy of you.", "NTA. \n\nYou can still love someone (Ann) but see that there's something that would make a relationship not work (e.g., her blindness to her brother's behavior, plus not understanding Bo is your family). \n\nDog stays, and I think you on behalf of this dog and a million others.", "I wish everybody treated their pets with the same love and compassion you have for Bo. You're right, OP, dogs are family and they had no right to ask you to \"put him in a shelter\". Al was supposed to be a temporary houseguest, but didn't help with anything, mooched off you and didn't look like he was going anywhere anytime soon.

Pets are part of a family, end of story.", "NTA  \n\n\nAnd change your locks if you haven't already.", "NTA. Not one bit. Thank you for standing by Bo, just as he has stood by you. Honestly, everyone sucks in this story except for you and Bo. Your parents and sister suck for their stance. Ann/Amy sucks for defending her crappy brother, letting him do jack to help out around your apartment, and suggesting you get rid of Bo (even temporarily rehoming him with your family would not have been an acceptable ask imo). Al sucks for being a useless freeloader. Everyone just sucks here, except for you and good boy Bo.\n\nEdit: wording", "NTA - But for the record you are officially broken up.  You kicked her out and she left.

Al was a horrible guest who over stayed his welcome.", "NTA for prioritizing a beloved pet over a human leech.  Your family can take the leech if they want to be helpful.", "NTA. Your ex-gf\u2019s brother sounds like a right piece of work, good riddance.

But asking you to put the dog in a shelter is utter lunacy.", "NTA. Glad you didn\u2019t surrender Bo to a shelter. Your his only family.", "NTA\n\nYou set your boundary before her brother moved in, they both are the AH in both agreeing to then attempting to violate that boundary.\n\nSounds to me like a small price to pay to learn now what kind of person your ex really was.  At least she didn't wait until you were married and/or had kids.", "NTA. When my boyfriend and I started dating, I made it very clear that I will pick my cat over him if there's ever an issue because she'd been in my life longer and was family. Sadly, that cat passed away almost 2 years ago, but now we have 2 new cats together (but they're mine if we ever break up, lol). Luckily, there was never an issue where he would even consider asking me to get rid of the cat(s) and he knows how important they are to me. Though in a situation like yours, I would do the same thing you did. Pets are not temporary, and rehoming them is a major decision that affects their lives massively. At least with people you can tell them why you're ditching them (and in this case, it was her choice. You gave her another option.) \n\nAl could take allergy meds, get a job and move out, get an air purifier, vacuum more so there's less dander; there are so many steps they could (and should) have gone through before even considering asking you to rehome your dog. It's incredibly inconsiderate of your girlfriend and her brother to jump straight to that.", "NTA.  You were clear from the beginning about the dog. Furthermore, he was a guest in your home and his lazy freeloading self was making a mess in the apartment and he was eating your food with no contributions ($$ or doing chores).  To be honest, any allergies he had were probably worsened by his keeping his bedroom filthy.   He was free-loading and his sister was enabling his bad behavior and not helping him to get his life back on track.  You're much better off without them.  His sister will eventually wake up and tell her brother to get his shit together.", "NTA!! You\u2019d only have been the AH if you HAD abandoned Bo! Good on you for standing up for your good boi.", "NTA.  I believe the brother of OP's ex girlfriend was supposed to be a short-term roommate while he looked for a job and another place to live.  If this is correct, why in the world would anyone ask OP to get rid of his dog if the brother was supposed to be moving out soon?  I would feel it's safe to say that the brother liked not working,  and free-loading off OP and his ex-gf.", "NTA\n\nMy husband absolutely treated 2 of my siblings like family when we were still dating.  But that doesn't mean they were.  That doesn't mean he had any obligation beyond civility and basic respect.  \n\nAnd, importantly, they equally treated him as family.  Nobody abused eachother's kindness, nobody took advantage of eachother.  Neither he nor those two were ever uncivil or failing in basic respect.  And I wouldn't have stood for it.  And with the 3rd, I didn't.\n\nThe 3rd sibling who *was* an asshole, I love him very much, but I'm now VLC with him for many reasons and you can bet his crap toward my husband (he told my husband he wasn't a 'real man' for going along with my expressly stated wishes not to have an engagement ring, as 1 example) is a part of it.\n\nThat's not the situation you have here.\n\nThis is too much.  Frankly it's too much even ignoring demanding you rehome your dog, but that pushes it beyond the pale.  And she was okay with all of this.

Both of my dogs are rescues. I would never choose a partner over them. Ann, it seems, didn't see your dog as family and was willing to dump the poor pup. Ann got dumped instead.

WTF is wrong with your parents & sister?

Nope screw that", "NTA. Brother was drowning in his own shit. The allergies that got worse was probably the trash around him. \nIf your girlfriend thinks it was worth getting rid of your dog in favour of a temporary guest, then it was probably gonna be permanent.

Hell no. \nGlad you surrendered the girlfriend too.", "Pets are not disposable! NTA  but... you did not post the dog tax so....", "Def not the AH. He knew what he was getting into and was acting all nice to get a place to stay. Now that he has one, he has done nothing to improve his life.

Just curious since you had two different there.", "NTA... beggars cannot be choosers.", "NTA. Seems like people devalue the love of pets way too much!", "NTA \n\nBut she\u2019s NTA either. Humans are always significantly more important than pets. If she chose to kick her brother out on 24 hours notice to continue living with you and your dog, she\u2019d be TA. I understand and agree her brother was being incredibly immature, a horrible roommate, and had to go (especially under the circumstances), but it\u2019s her brother(family) and not surprising he\u2019s more important to her than you/your dog. Try to consider being in her situation, it would suck more than yours!!\n\nIt\u2019s a bummer her brother couldn\u2019t be more respectful and make an effort to manage his allergies as it could have changed the outcome significantly. With that said, if you only loved her as much as you love your dog I think the end result was meant to be. I hesitate to be this type of person, but assuming you don\u2019t have kids and obviously aren\u2019t married(or 100% committed to a partner), I don\u2019t think you realize how insignificant a pet is compared to a true spouse/child/human family member. I think you played it right for where you\u2019re at in life, which obviously isn\u2019t fully committed to her and that\u2019s okay if it\u2019s okay with you.

If Ann had asked if your family or a friend could take Bo for a while, while Al sorts things out, that would've been one thing. But Ann and Al suggested the frankly nuclear route of completely getting rid of your dog. You don't just get rid of a pet because they're an inconvenience. Pets are family and a commitment for most pet owners (as they should be, imo). Some people don't see it that way, but those sorts of people don't tend to make great partners for those who care about their pets. I'm glad you stuck to your guns. If Ann feels pets are something you can get rid of when they're no longer convenient, she probably would have caused other issues in your pet caretaking. Good job removing the ex and her brother and keeping the dog. I think it was the right move for you.", "NTA. Pretty sure his allergies getting worse were the result of his own lack of hygiene.

You TOLD Ann AND Al the condition of him moving in was you under NO CIRCUMSTANCES would get rid of Bo. This makes me think they never intended to honor that agreement in the first place.\n\n3.) It feels like Ann was manipulating your feelings for her to get a good living situation. She wasn't paying rent, her brother was mooching off you, and she was asking you to get rid of your dog.

I mean that's pretty par for the course at 22 & 23 and outcome would've probably been the same no matter what, and you're NTA, but this isn't about choosing between dog and human.

Since he\u2019s marginally impacted by allergies, I bet he\u2019d choose to leave rather then do all that work.", "NTA. I think too many people forget that humans are also just animals. If she wasn't willing to put her brother in a shelter, she shouldn't be expecting you to put your dog in one. Nobody would even be sticking him in a cage or putting him down and frankly he's in a much better position to understand the situation than the poor puppet. \n\nI don't get people who view pets as playthings. This isn't you being selfish not sacrificing your \"toy\" so he can have a place to live. YOU were willing to make sacrifices (of which you made plenty frankly), but you weren't going to force Bo to and that's fair. Why on Earth would Bo be expected to make sacrifices for his owner's girlfriend's brother? Bo is family, your girlfriend's brother isn't. That expectation only comes from seeing Bo as less than and unimportant. Your family is wrong, you don't want that back. Find somebody who sees him as a living being that doesn't need to give up his home, his family, and, depending on the shelter, even his life over a grown man's temporary discomfort. Which, by the way, was aggravated by him being a SLOB-that's why he couldn't live with a dog. He did nothing to minimize the allergens despite having plenty of time to do so. He made no concessions, no sacrifices, and contributed nothing but still expects you and Bo to make sacrifice after sacrifice after sacrifice all while living on YOUR dime. Anybody who thinks you should put up with that BS can stuff it, including your heartless ex.", "NTA!!!! \nI even fought with my own family because they talked shit about one of my dogs. \n\nand btw I would  100/100 date you after this :D", "There are very few things that could get me to straight up kick someone out of my home, but suggesting I rehome my dog is one of them. My dog is my family, and he takes priority over *anyone* staying in my house. NTA.", "A TEMPORARY thing would be something like the brother staying for a week or 2, asking that they board the dog while he was there, and paying for it.  It's a admittedly large request, but not completely unreasonable.\n\nGet rid of the dog so bro can freeload is beyond the pale though.  OP was 100% right to kick them both out.", "Yeah, exactly this. It's weird that both would agree that Bo wasn't going anywhere, then try to bully OP into reconsidering when Al's stay was supposed to be TEMPORARY. Al is not their child, or even their responsibility. OP was doing him a massive favor by even allowing him to stay with them. I don't understand this level of entitlement.", "Honestly it's just like basic respect. How do you live with someone, ask them to do you a huge favor for your family, and then expect them to give up their dog? Like, what? \n\nThis relationship was sunk as soon as she asked. No way OP could have stayed with her without resenting that question/the way she thinks of him.", "Definitely NTA.  The allergy got worse because he lacks hygiene and is lazy.\n\nI have allergies and a big dog that sheds a lot.  I vacuum every day and then call him to sleep with me.  Still alive and very happy.", "That was my only thought reading this- did OP mention Al\u2019s unacceptable behaviors to him/Ann? He\u2019s still NTA, but it felt like 0-100 in one conversation", "Seriously, OP - we're all getting quite impatient, waiting to see pictures of the star of this thread!", "Makes me want to cry. I just can\u2019t even imagine it. They are living beings\u2026 its not a toy car you got for christmas. Would be an automatic red flag for me for anyone who considers a pet as disposable.", "Absolutely not.  Even if the brother was being a dream guest, re-homing the dog for what was supposed to be a temporary stay isn't an option.", "Yeah I'm blown away that I had to scroll this far down to see this comment.\n\nThreatening to kick your girlfriend out of her home (even if she's not on the lease) with 24 hour notice is an extreme reaction that would often lead to a breakup no matter what.  Especially since it doesn't seem like OP had even talked to his GF yet about his issues with Al.\n\nSure, the brother sucks and the girlfriend is being insensitive, but she's in a tough position and is likely reacting emotionally.  This comes across as financial abuse for sure.", "Should have offered to send Ai there instead lol", "# ALL OF THIS!!!", "Yes, we need the Bo tax!", "Anyone remember the op and the allergic stepson and the allergic daughter  ended up being thrown out", "Honestly if he has fast food wrappers and dirty laundry piling up in his room then his worsening allergies very well could've been mold or dirt build up in his room and him breathing all that crap in.", "That's the solution - GET OUT, freeloader.  Get your own allergy-free place and leave the dog out of it.", "He also took advantage of the situation and did nothing to be a considerate guest.  He moved in and he wouldn't have left on his own.   He just wanted to have someone to take care of him.   \n\nIf both OP and his girlfriend were committed to the relationship,  she wouldn't have allowed her brother to be such a freeloader and jeopardize her relationship with OP.", "This. And also taken on more cleaning chores to make the place more habitable.   We havr guinea pigs and my partner and I are mildly allergic so work goes into keeping the living room (where they live) habitable for us.\n\nIf I moved into a place with cats/dogs/whatever rent free I'd be asking if it's okay for me to vaccuum/rent a wet vac/buy an air purifier to help keep my allergies under control.", "Well, also living in filth can make allergies worse, or can just cause allergy like symptoms. Sounds like the dude was disgusting.", "Honestly, I wonder if his allergies actually got worse or if he was feeling worse by living in filth? Mold can do a number on you. If he had fast food trash all over his room, it could've been that (rather than his allergies all of a sudden being worse).", "(*Drumming my fingers impatiently on my desk*). \n\nWe're *waaaaiting....*", "Yeah, I mean I have a strong feeling but we're going to need some concrete proof to be sure", "Good point", "Depends on whether you're allergic to it or not. But even then, clean a lot, have an airfilter and keep the animal out of your room and it'll be fine for a while.", "I'm so glad Zyrtec works for you.\n\nOne really nice thing about my ex - who was unfortunately allergic to cats and dogs - is that he never once ever said, \"It's me or the cat.\"  First, because he knows that's a battle he would have lost.  And second, he was an animal lover who just had the misfortune of being allergic.  So he'd come to my apartment and stay as long as he was able to (*and truly, some days he'd make it eight hours or so before he'd blotch up)*.  And our sleepovers would be at his house. It was easy, we made do, and getting rid of my cat never once came into it.", "I just wrote this. I became allergic to my dog 5 yrs ago. I'm lucky I only need the store brand Zyrtec 1x/day.", "I could see the possibility of boarding the dog for a week, assuming it was on the brother's dime.  It would be a massive request, but not completely unreasonable IMO.\n\nWhat they're proposing is absolutely insane.  OP 100% made the right decision.", "This is the right comment. He\u2019s a temporary guest who is being helped out, he isn\u2019t a long-term partner or lodger. You don\u2019t even contemplate such a change for a temporary person you\u2019re helping out. If dudes allergies were that bad he could have got off his ass and found a job and moved out within the last month.", "For the win!", "... and was doing his part regarding chores. Even without the dog issue, I would not have a roomate who does not contribute financially and/or by doing chores. Don't forget he was waiting for someone to do his laundry!!! So wanting to rehome the dog, even just for a few weeks, was not just the issue here.", "*(BUNNIES!!!)*\n\nSorry, this whole thread is making me squee over all the truly devoted pet parents!", "I have never owned a cat before and my allergist was shocked I wasn\u2019t allergic to them. Dogs have my heart and I\u2019m willing to suffer for that. I am glad you were never pressured to give up your pets for love.", "Exactly.  He got off lucky.", "I would not be surprised with a plot twist like: he wasn't her brother, was her lover.", "How does he know it is the dog making his allergies worse?  Living in FILTH can exacerbate them as well.  Just sayin'", "Pets are so much better than people, it's not even a competition \ud83d\ude02", "I found out three months after getting my bun that I was allergic to her. I do what was mentioned above, plus an allergy pill I can only get from one manufacturer, with Allegra as backup. My wife and I were committed. I only really feel it anymore during shedding season, and bunny 2 is a Rex so the shedding is different.\n\nWe got a second bun to try and make the first one happy, and she hates him. But they both have bunny mansions, runtime, good treats, ect. Even though I don't think they will work out, we are keeping both.", "Bunnies are the BEST. Mine is scheduled for a $1500 surgery (she has defective teeth) at a vet clinic 3 hours away. I didn\u2019t think twice about it. She\u2019s worth every last penny, even though she\u2019d sell me to the Devil if he let her eat a tortilla.", "When I got my with now husband I told him my pets go no where and I am not kicking the dogs out of the bed they have slept in for years and he was like ok and they all co exist wonderfully.", "Years ago, I was moving out of my then-boyfriend's home, and it was only three more days till I could get into my new place.  On the evening in question, my ex suddenly started acting really weird... And I'll tell you, my spidey-sense kicked in and I thought, \"He's going to let my cat out.  I'm going to come home from work tomorrow, and my baby's going to be gone.\"\n\nSo I quickly found an inexpensive, pet-friendly hotel for my last few days before I could get to my new apartment.  I got a couple of my ex's friends who were sick of him too, and they came over and picked up me, my cat and my bags.  Whatever my ex was planning to do - and I 100% believe he was going to do something to my cat - I got the jump on him before he had a chance to make my cat \"disappear.\"", "Not going to lie that is a place my lifetime movie brain went as well. I tried to steer clear because I know I have a twisted wrapped since of people.", "I guess he was living the same in his previous home so to be fair, it is probably the dog. BUT who would choose a dirty-lazy roomate over a nice dog?", "Mmm hmmmm!  Give those bun-buns a hug from me!", "Awww... I'm sorry they're not  Bunny Buddies, but as long as you have the option to keep them separate, I'm glad you and your wife are keeping them.", "That's so cool!  Yeah, my pets have always slept on the bed with me.  When my 18 year old cat passed away, I cried myself to sleep each night.  The first night was the hardest - that was the first time in 17 1/2  years he wasn't next to me.  After a week and a half, I caved and adopted my nutty little rescue girl *(a* *2 month old feral kitten who had to be socialized, but she's worth it*), and she's changed my life.  She's nine years old now, and is getting into \"cranky old lady land\" - how that time just flew! I don't know what on earth happened to that goofy little ball of fluff that fit into the palm of my hand nine years back.", "I often joke that I learned how to knit/crochet/sew/weave so that I could trade my skills for allergy meds in a post-apocalyptic situation \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m allergic to most pollens, but thankfully not cats or dogs"]}
