My bf and I took a 14 hour trip so he could visit with some of his family and I could see where he grew up. My boyfriend\u2019s 3 sisters absolutely hate me. They hate me because he used to be married and he left his wife to be with me. He got married at 19.\n\n I didn\u2019t want to be with him at first. I told him that he needs to be with his wife and I am not ok with ending a marriage. He ended things with her anyway and it took me awhile to actually accept and be with him. He had been with his wife since middle school, they are from a small, small town and their families were extremely close. He got with her because she was/is best friends with one of his sisters and he\u2019s the only girl he\u2019s ever dated. He\u2019s said he didn\u2019t know what love was until he met me, him and his wife never even had sex either. None of that matters but putting it here for more context. \n\nWe have been together for almost a year now and the sisters still won\u2019t accept the fact. His mom is on the \u201cwhatever makes you happy\u201d side but his sisters will not accept me at all. Having my partners family accept me is a really big deal. I don\u2019t know what to do. He asked them if it\u2019s alright if I come down for the holidays and his older sister sent him a huge paragraph about it, the one who\u2019s best friends with the ex didn\u2019t say anything, and the younger said it was ok along with his mom.  I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\nYes I do know that it\u2019s a terrible thing that he was married but I really did not want him to end things with her. I\u2019ve talked to her before and told her everything I told him about not wanting to be with him and how terrible I felt and how I\u2019m not a woman who goes around sleeping with married men, that\u2019s not me at all. I used to get 5+ hate messages a day from random accounts calling me a home wrecker, whore, slut, and many more things and just about how terrible I am. I\u2019m not the person they think I am.\n\nHis oldest sister is also friends with one of my friends sisters and told her she does not want me coming, I\u2019m not wanted here, it\u2019s disrespectful and she doesn\u2019t care to meet me. So now I am refusing to go to lunch with all of them until his older sister apologizes or something. My bf is telling me to put it aside but I physically can not go feeling this way.

And good on at least some of his sisters who see through this.  You're not wanted there.  As for your actual question, NTA...because they don't want to meet you either.", "ESH\n\nYou're enmeshed in his messy marriage/separation.  You've been sold your own story from him. You may never actually know the real truth.\n\nThe sisters should be upset with him.  He should be taking those shots for you.  He should be talking to them and working through his family drama that HE CREATED. \n\nRegardless of how you approached this, the perception is that YOU are the reason for the marriage failing.  You are the scapegoat or the cause.  You are the target.  It is what it is.  No matter how you sell this your boyfriend chose to end his marriage to be with you, your story proves that he had the option, just because you two didn't sleep together before he \"left\" doesn't mean he didn't leave for you. \n\nI've been in a position somewhat like yours.  Coles notes version:  \n\nMy ex used my trauma to be the hero and make his move.  He sold me on a story that was full of half truths.  He left a 20 year marriage for me.  I was the homewrecker.  No matter what I did.  No matter what my truth was.  Didn't matter.  I spent nearly 7 years with him. In that time, I was able to discern that he had a behaviour pattern that I'm sure he used on his wife.  So he may have believed they were done, but I do not at all believe she thought that. It took a long time for me to figure it out.  The relationship was hard and I was always so sensitive to it.  \n\nLong story short, people say what they want to say to get what they want.  He didn't even have to hold the weight of his choices, I did, my kid did.  I was so dumb for believing him and I'm now so grateful to be away from all that.  Save yourself the heartache girl. It's not easy walking around with a scarlet letter, especially when you feel like you never earned it. \n\nI wouldn't meet up with anyone that doesn't want to meet you and I would tell my boyfriend that if he is upset with that then he should really do the work to fix it.  Ultimately, you will decide if he is worth all of this and if he is, meet the people who are open to getting to know you and if he's not then end this and file it in the \"well that sure was a lesson\" folder.  \n\nHope everything works out in YOUR best interest.", "OP you're now with a guy that's willing to cheat on his current partner to be with the next love of his life.", "You mean to tell me you believe that a married couple has never had sex?  You\u2019re gullible as well as amoral.\n\nThey don\u2019t have to accept you.  They don\u2019t have to like you.  You keep saying that this is not who you are, *but it is.* You wrecked a marriage, and that affected people *other than you.*", "NTA. Your bf needs to put a stop to the harassment of you. If those two sisters cannot be civil with you, then he needs to not be seeing them either. They are disrespecting him by being hateful to you (after all, HE's the one who broke up his marriage, not you).", "ESH, the sisters are being way too hateful towards you when their brother is the one that cheated on his wife with you and he seems to be getting zero blowback from any of them for his actions. But you slept with a married man, you need to accept that a lot of people won\u2019t be a fan of you because that\u2019s a shitty thing to do. You say several times that you didn\u2019t want to be with a married man and yet you were, if you didn\u2019t want to be with him that much you would\u2019ve blocked him and stopped seeing him. \n\nYou need to take far more accountability for your actions because frankly at this point you\u2019re taking none, but his sisters need to grow up and aim more of this anger at their brother who is the worst in this situation and your bf needs to stop trying to force a relationship between you and his family when they\u2019ve all made it abundantly clear they don\u2019t want one with you.", "sorry but yta\n\nyou were a part of wrecking the marriage, so yes, you are a homewrecker. more blame goes on him, but you knew he was married\n\nand you cannot be naive enough to buy that bad sex is not real sex, come on\n\nhis family and friends have no reason to apologize or even talk to you. you entered a relationship with a married man, that is on you.\n\nalso, you know he is gonna cheat on you right? i mean, how you started this relationship is not built on trust.", "NTA for not wanting to go.  I would not let it slide that he is disregarding your feelings  in order to appease his family.  He should flat out tell them that you won\u2019t go to lunch with the sisters who have said you aren\u2019t welcome. Period.  If he can\u2019t stand up to them for you now you will have many more problems ahead of you. \n\nAs for the sisters who are bitter, it\u2019s understandable that they won\u2019t like the person he had an affair with.  He seems far too immature to have gotten married at 19 and it\u2019s up to you to decide if you want to walk with him during his journey to maturity now.  Eventually the ex wife will move on and the sisters will have less to be mad about.  Good luck.", "What? Him and his wife never had sex and his sisters are mad that he ended things? That's some stupid for you right there. Was he supposed to go his entire life never having sex with his wife so his family could be happy? Do they even know that? \n\nI'd honestly end things if I were you. They will never accept you, and you will always be the home wreaker. So the options are, he cuts them out of his life, or you break up. My judgment is NTA cause he's a big boy and ended his marriage even though you told him no. He would have done it no matter what it seemed.", "I think you are downplaying the timeframe of being with him to make it sound better, but it doesn't. I'm going with ESH on this post, assuming there is some fluffed up and missing info.", "YTA suck it up and go.", "Why would you voluntarily go meet people who hate you? Why would your boyfriend *want* you to meet people who hate you? That makes zero sense. \n\nI\u2019m a little confused on how he fell in love with you if you weren\u2019t dating (were you friends/coworkers?), but messy timeline aside, there\u2019s no reason for you to voluntarily expose yourself to abuse, which is what would happen. \n\nI get that he wants you to meet his family, but they don\u2019t want to meet you. He can\u2019t make them be kind to you and expects you to just suck it up? Again, why? \n\nNTA. He can go have brunch/lunch/dinner/whatever with them, but there\u2019s no reason to subject yourself to that.", "NTA - it might be too soon. Your bf needs to work with them on understanding what happened before they will accept you. They need to know you didn\u2019t want to be with him.\n\nAlso, are you sure he\u2019s the one for you? His lack of life experience is worrisome.", "NTA, but OP, I think you need to think about seriously on whether you really want to be with this guy. Your bf's family disrespects and demeans you, and his reasons for leaving his ex-wife really doesn't make much sense. I think you should take a step back and reevaluate your relationship.", "NTA. He cheated on his ex. I would dump his ass because it\u2019s not worth it, it\u2019s been too soon since they ended things (even a year), and you can\u2019t fix him. If you are worried that he\u2019ll cheat on you too, that is a terrible feeling to carry through your relationship. And he is not emotionally mature enough to handle\u2026anything, it seems. Him telling you to set your feelings aside is another big red flag.\n\nHis sisters can\u2019t quite bring themselves to be too upset with him so they have directed their anger to you. You can\u2019t change their minds. Also I wouldn\u2019t believe that he really did tell them the things that he said he did.", "He almost sounds like someone who got bored with first wife and went looking for the next fun thing. I don\u2019t believe that he and first wife never had sex. His family has the right to not want you around but you also have the right to not go where you are not wanted. He is not helping the situation. Think about this situation because if he gets bored he may go looking for another fun thing.", "You don't get to try to act as if you are an innocent babe in the woods who did nothing wrong when you were 50% part of the decision to date this guy. You also don't get to be 'surprised' or 'angry' or act like you are 'better than'. You aren't. They get to have their opinion, you get to have yours. Bottom line is that he cheated, you were the affair partner, the families are upset because they are all friends and you want an apology. Got it.\n\nESH", "Why is he asking you to go knowing all this? And why is he not stopping the bullying from his family? NTA but he is. And so are the sisters, but the real issue is him.", "NTA\n\nYou are willing to meet his family, just not the members who are actively hostile towards you. \n\n>home wrecker, whore, slut, and many more things and just about how terrible I am\n\nThis seems to be the standard when a man leaves his wife for another woman. If the older sister has been told that he left his wife even after you said you weren't going to be with him, that he needed to win you over because you were so against breaking up a marriage, then she has no reason to be hostile.\n\nDo either of you know what the ex-wife has told or is telling the sister? Because if you told the ex about how sorry you were, then you really aren't the bad guy. \n\nJust tell your partner that his sisters need more time to process and that forcing them to be together isn't going to make anything better. It might even make it worse. \n\nThe best process is to have the younger sister and mother get to know you, get to see how happy the two of you make each other, and then they will start defending you more. \n\nAll the best OP!", "Esh, you for saying you didn't want to be with him while he was married yet you were. And then when he broke up with her, because of you, you quickly went with him. And if he was married at 19 and you guys are 23 and you said he never had sex with her. So you're saying he was a virgin when he was with you. Not sure that is a believable situation. And you said it was a small spoon town and his sisters don't want to be with a cheater that's their prerogative. Have the mother and the younger sister come to visit? You guys don't go there. The sisters are a-holes for the simple reason is they will put it behind them but a lot of people won't accept the cheater. And that's what you were and so is he. So either get over it and be awkward or don't visit the family. And if you say it's important to you, then you're going to have to change what you think's important because more than likely they will never accept you.", "I\u2019m going with ESH\n\nYou keep going on about how he was in a loveless marriage and it was sexless etc\u2026\u2026Just remember that\u2019s HIS side of the story\u2026\u2026If he was happy to cheat on her you can\u2019t honestly believe you\u2019re getting 100% the truth\n\nAlso you can\u2019t honestly expect to immediately play happy families when his sisters and mom knew what was going on??  Of course they are most likely upset and probably disgusted by his behaviour as well\n\nYou may never be accepted by this family and that\u2019s the gist of it\u2026..What makes you so sure in years to come that he won\u2019t give some other woman the same sob story about you and start cheating with her?\n\nIf you\u2019re smart you\u2019ll walk away and learn from this experience", "Sorry, I don\u2019t buy your sob story. It\u2019s not that hard to just *not* be with a married man. None of your context about not wanting him to leave her for you matters; you\u2019re with him now. If I were his sisters, I wouldn\u2019t accept you either. \n\nYou sure he won\u2019t divorce you for the next girl that comes along? \n\nESH", "The funny thing about him not having sex is that his ex wife wanted kids but wouldn\u2019t let him actually have sex??  His sister do not know me at all. And yes he would\u2019ve ended things with her anyway because he\u2019s told me he don\u2019t think he ever truly loved her. He cheated on her a lot and apart of me is scared he will do the same to me but idk, I put my foot down a hell of a lot more with him than she did.", "I posted this originally on relationship advice before I came down here, since then we have actually officially been together for a year.", "We were friends before/coworkers as well", "How much life experience do you expect him to have? He is 23.", "I\u2019ve had this thought too, it\u2019s been a very hard relationship. He had to get over that I\u2019ve been with people and he hasn\u2019t. But I do believe in some way I was meant for him. I do really want things to last and workout. But the family aspect has been so hard, his ex is very much merged into their lives. She\u2019s told me that they will never accept me and I\u2019m learning that it is probably true.", "Thank you. But no, I have no idea what the ex-wife had told the sisters or what they tell each other. My boyfriend also told his older sister HIMSELF that I did not want to be with him. And she still is being hostile.", "I said it took me awhile to accept and be with him. We were friends while he was married and admitted his feelings to me one day and I REFUSED. And yes from what he\u2019s told me he was a \u201cvirgin\u201d she didn\u2019t want sex and when they tried it hurt her to bad so they never really did it and he doesn\u2019t count that.", "While I still believe you're not an ah, I now believe you are incredibly naive. I bet you if you straight-up ask his ex-wife if they ever had sex, you will get a very different story. They probably stopped having sex because he was cheating on her left and right. He's gonna cheat on you, too, just so you know. And his sisters probably know all this crap and that's why they don't like you and think you're a lying home wrecker.", "Whoa whoa wait, \"he cheated on her a lot\" and somehow his sisters aren't mad at him? That's some creative logic there. Now it's all on you, too. And good luck with him and that fidelity thing.", "Sis, why are you tolerating ANY of this?\n\nYou are 23 years old. You have the BEST years of your life in front of you. Do not was one more year with a guy who will allow his family to treat you like crap. He should have stepped in already and put his sisters in their place.\n\nI totally get ending a relationship that started in middle school. People grow and change. He should have ended it before getting involved with you. Who knows what the whole story is here but I sincerely doubt that it is exactly as he presented it.\n\nHere is the thing though - you have an AMAZING life in front of you, but it won't be with this guy. This guy is someone who will make your life miserable. He could be the nicest guy in the world but he's not going to be the nicest guy in YOUR world if he is permitting his family to treat you like garbage.\n\nHonestly? break up with him. Move on. Find someone who adores you and whose family adores you. Get your education. Travel - see the world. Do NOT allow yourself to get sucked into small town drama because you will NEVER be able to reverse whatever crap they spin about you. It is 100% NOT worth it.", "I think they mean the crossover with his wife. Were you two having an affair before he left his wife? Sure seems that way. I can\u2019t imagine a married man chasing after a woman and leaving his wife for that woman if she was saying \u201cnope, not interested\u201d.", "Are you prepared for the ex to be invited to all holidays and events? Are you prepared for the meddling from his older sister? This may not be something that will mellow with time. This could be your entire future.\nEdit: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, but I do think you\u2019re being very naive about this situation", "Then that's just how she is going to be for now. \n\nLet him know you understand how important it is that you and his family are engaged, but they aren't changing their minds over a lunch. \n\nYou'll meet with 2, or none.", "How was he a Virgin if he \"cheated on her a lot?\"", "So bad sex doesn't count as sex? And you know it doesn't matter what he says. It wouldn't matters what the sisters perceive. Perception is reality. You won't change the sisters perception and they will probably never accept you. Try to deal with the mom and the little sister but besides that the other two are never going to accept you", "are you the older sister?\n\nbecause it's kind of a jump to assume from the story that we've heard, to 'he's a cheater'.  he got married too young, and when he saw someone he felt he'd rather be with, he *left his wife*.\n\nyou're making assumptions, and probably projecting your own experiences onto this situation.", "He never physically cheated on her, but he would text a lot of girls. And yes I am scared he\u2019s going to cheat on me as well.", "Nope. I'm replying directly to what op has said. For example, op said he cheated on his wife several times.", "So why are you with him?? You\u2019re literally hated by his family and they\u2019re probably not gonna like you for a while, if being liked by the family matters then it\u2019s already doomed. Plus if \u201cthat\u2019s not me at all\u201d you\u2019re letting yourself be this homewrecker character for a guy that\u2019s lying and cheating to someone he says he\u2019s committed to, like if you didn\u2019t want to be with him, then don\u2019t! Sounds like you got wore down or you\u2019re just making excuses and can\u2019t do better", "Yeah, and if I caught my husband cheating on me in any way, shape, or form, I would no longer trust him enough to allow him inside my body. This is the oldest sob story of all time, and it's very rarely true. Idk why he decided to leave his wife for you, but I'm guessing it had something to do with you not wanting to sleep with a married man and his love of conquest. I would break up with him if I were you. You will probably never feel secure and will always wonder when he's gonna pull the same bs line on the next woman. It's not worth the anxiety this will cause you.", "I'm guessing this information comes from him. He's the one that \"reassured\" you that he never physically cheated, right?"]}
