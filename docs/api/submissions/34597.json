She really thought by coming here, everyone would agree with her. The arrogance is appalling.", "She cross posted it herself", "I mean that's exactly what it is.", "There you go.", "I honestly don't know how much our high chair cost, we got it from friends whose kid no longer needs it.\n\nWhich doesn't definitely mean it's cheap, that's also how we got our French oak bassinet and changing table.", "Omg I'm waiting for the update where OP admits they were trying to get the chair.", "As if she's even paying them to watch her kid. She's getting a free ride and is going to toss it away due to her rudeness and disrespect. \n\nWhat a kind gesture for her family to offer to watch her baby and then put out money to make it safe. All OP can see is green. This isn't about the chair. It's about her jealousy. Definitely TA, OP", "Id be making OP provide everything I would need to babysit her child for free.  She'd be buying my house a high chair, a playpen, and a crib.  \n\nOPs getting free childcare and complaining about the furniture quality being TOO GOOD. \n\nOP, it is so sadly obvious that you have a huge hang up about the money disparity.  Be it just your BIL/SIL or your whole husbands family.  Address it.\n\nYTA", "Exactly! OP you are very rude and ungrateful! I can't believe that you have the nerve to come on here asking atia! Yes 100000% YTA! What's wrong with you ? Kmt!", "Same! I was always grateful that my parents stocked their home with grandchild equipment. Now, my partner\u2019s nieces have a bunch of little ones & I love making sure we have everything they need to be comfortable here.

Is it ridiculous?  Sure.  But as a fellow child free person with extra disposable income due to lack of children, sometimes we spend money on ridiculous shit.", "Something tells me $1000 is a huge exaggeration", "I mean, BIL and SIL may have decided to invest in a really good quality one because they could use it for their own future children (if they plan to have any). No matter what their reasoning is, OP is being totally ridiculous.\n\nEdit: grammar", "Lol. My friend and I have a similar relationship.  Money flows between us like water.  If I have it, she has it, and vice versa.  But it is kind of funny when I open my purse which I had left in her presence while I had to leave the room, and I find money she stuck in it.

Hahaha!", "20 years ago I bought a beautiful oak Amish made highchair that fit our kitchen perfectly. Paid a couple hundred for it -  probably double that by now. \n\nEnjoyed looking at it when not using it every single day until it moved into the dining room to act as a high chair at the table and then on into basement where it is awaiting the next generation. For its time in use it was a real piece of furniture that was in its place for years. \n\nI never once thought it was a waste of money - we certainly got our use out of it, it\u2019s still in perfect condition, and I could probably get what I paid for it now if I wanted.  \n\nWe shouldn\u2019t begrudge others for wanting nice things that look good in their house even if we wouldn\u2019t make that choice.

When you\u2019re a parent you grow accustomed to the large amounts of brightly coloured tacky plastic crap in your house (and also realise children will fuck up anything nice you have anyway) but these are a pair of DINKS in their 40s who by the sounds of things have a nicely designed house and didn\u2019t want a piece of baby furniture they couldn\u2019t put away standing out like an eyesore in their house. It\u2019s a lot but as someone who cares how my space looks (although with not remotely this budget to spend on\u2026. Well anything ha) if it wasn\u2019t a big expense to me that\u2019s what I\u2019d do to - plus baby stuff is always available second hand she might not have even paid anywhere near that for it.", "I feel like OP might be exaggerating about the price.

Only the youngest of us has had babies, two of us are step-parents to kids we got at older ages.  However I got a really nice crib, glider/rocker and a high chair when the oldest nephew (now 12) started staying with me on the regular.  Why? They weren\u2019t planning on him being an only child, my friends were also starting to have kids, and I now also have step grandchildren. Also I\u2019d been looking for an excuse to have a glider/rocker/recliner for years and it gave me one.  It\u2019s my favorite chair.", "Yep.  The carting of the playpen is not a pretty sight.", "I have a kid, and preferred snaps for sleepers. Lucky me, she never tried to get into her diaper for art supplies. Just saying,  they may have kids, just not the determined artists type.", "Except my second had to rub his bare belly and nothing realistic could keep him away.  So snaps for him were better.

My mother-of-three sister-in-law bought us baby clothes with snaps.", "I remember my mom safety pinning the zipper pull, into their sleepers, so they wouldn't pull them off. It was the only thing that stopped them, because they were afraid of getting poked by the pin.", "Well, this is wrong. We had no issues, because we were lucky enough to not have children interested in poop-painting.

I have seven nieces and nephews and 13 grandnieces and grandnephews.  I think they're all *mostly* done?  But still - it's good advice, and as a childfree person, I appreciate knowing that!   I normally buy off of registries, and honestly - I never thought to check how the sleepers are fastened!", "Neither of my kids ever touched their own shit, but I still love zippers for their ease of use and hate snaps.  Who wants to do each individual snap every f-ing time they need to change a diaper in the middle of the night?", "I always search for the zipper that has the fabric flap that snaps down over the zipper pull.

I never, ever buy snap up sleepers as gifts. Always zippers!! Because I knnnooowwww. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Oh it\u2019s there lol", "Right? I ended up here entirely because of repost accounts on other social media, got tired of not just getting it at the source \ud83d\ude02", "I preferred snaps too since middle of the night I only needed to snap the legs and a little up the center instead of full on unzipping the whole thing removing the lower half and fighting to get the feet back in, diaper changes were so much easier with snaps", "My son never did it either . I always preferred snaps too. He was an only so I am learning something new for when the grands come.", "I have five kids and preferred snaps too.  The reason is because with the zipper it bowed out and looked uncomfortable plus they could get off easily.  Actually, I disliked both and my first choice was separate foot pants and shirt but those were not as easy to find.", "Ah man. Our 11yo had to rub her belly button when she slept, it was the cutest. We did snap onesies/sleep pants for her because she would cry if she couldn't reach it lol.", "Yeah I've had 4 kids and not one of them ever tried to paint with their own poop. All 4 were similar brands of sensory averse so they also hated finger painting with actual paint, and were spoon feeding themselves quite young because they freaked out if their hands were dirty. \n\nI think the closest I got to poop painting was when we started toilet training one of my kids took off their dirty nappy, and stepped in it accidentally and walked a trail of poop through to the potty. They were more upset about their dirty foot than the poop prints though.", "There's ones with reversible zippers now, so you can unzip from the foot, remove the legs, change the nappy, and do them back up. I always found doing up zippers to be easier than trying to get the snaps to line up with a wiggly baby too.", "Same. Also I accidentally zipped up a little skin one time. Rarely used the zips after that.", "We have some little outfits that can be zipped in either direction", "These were life for us. I would get irrationally disappointed when someone would get us one without the reversible zips.", "Amazing game changer.", "I watched my little brothers foreskin get caught in a jammie zipper when he was like, two, and my entire parenting life, I cringed whenever I had to zip one up.\n\nThat's a horror I only had to witness once."]}
