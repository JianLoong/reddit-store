I purposely didn\u2019t follow my sister\u2019s babysitting rules for my nephew", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been pretty worried about this so I\u2019d love some opinions. Today was my sister\u2019s(f28) birthday and her and her husband(m29) made plans to go out to dinner to a restaurant nearby. Their son is six months old and they\u2019ve only ever left him three times before. I\u2019ve minded him each of those times. They\u2019re very stressed financially and conscientious about raising their child. Her policy has always been for me to text her as soon as he wakes up, and then for me to attempt to soothe him while she rushes home.\n\nOnly one of the times has he woken up before they\u2019ve come back, and that was after maybe two and half or three hours. This time however he woke up about twenty minutes after they\u2019d left the building. I didn\u2019t want to ruin their night so I did my best to make sure he was as comfortable as possible and waited until they were finishing their dessert before I texted her. \n\nHe was screaming a lot of the time and I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ve emotionally traumatized him even though he wasn\u2019t hungry or anything. And I also know that my sister probably wouldn\u2019t be too happy as she never leaves him crying, but my thinking was that she\u2019ll never know, and her nice birthday dinner won\u2019t be ruined. But it may have been morally wrong and also damaging for my nephew. AITA?\n\nINFO I was with him the whole time apart from when I went to the bathroom, and I alternated between singing to him, making weird noises while he was in the cot and rocking him in my arms. He was probably crying for maybe 65% of the time, which was about two hours from when they left and came back.\n\nEdit: Thank you to the people who were kind. I\u2019m not going to do it again(partly because it was extremely unenjoyable I will admit) but it was also not a conscious decision from the beginning to go against her rules. \nI kept hoping he would go back to sleep or stop crying, which he did do for five or ten minutes here and there. Then things would happen like the elevator doors opening, or he would think that my face actually wasn\u2019t funny after all etc.\n\nJust to be clear I of course did not leave him hungry with dirty diaper. I also gave him plenty of cuddles and walked around with him and played some chill Satie which he liked for a little while. I would never ignore him that\u2019s borderline child abuse. I also know that he is healthy and getting on well for his age, my sister likes to discuss his scheduled doctor\u2019s visits with me as well as small everyday details about their lives on a regular basis.\nAlso we are close but she would NOT take any suggestions well from me about anything as I am much younger than her.", "created_utc": 1671060883, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm5um2/aita_i_purposely_didnt_follow_my_sisters/", "score": 579, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you were trying to do the right thing but she does have her rules and you should try to stick to them because they\u2019re what she wants for her child. First time parents are especially nervous about their baby\u2019s needs and if something bad had happened that night you would have been saddled with guilt for not doing what was asked of you. \n\nThey\u2019re her rules, and even if you don\u2019t fully agree with them, even if it\u2019s for her sake, she has her reasons for them and that\u2019s up to her to decide. You have to tell her instead of making the call to omit it completely, even if it seems silly and nothing happened. She has a right to know how her child is doing and if you felt like you had a handle on it, you could have assured her that you were trying to take care of it and that she didn\u2019t have to rush back, and let it be her choice.\n\nI personally think that she is overly worried. I know that this is just part of having a baby, but it is something she\u2019s specified as part of her rules. Going by the parameters of your info and the context of the situation that\u2019s why I think YTA.\n\nEdited to add a little more reasoning for the vote.", "YTA but with good intentions. I understand your thinking and know you were trying to do the right thing. However, I think if the parents leave specific instructions on how they want their child watched it should be abided by unless it is harmful. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to follow those instructions you should just decline to babysit. Again I understand why you did what you did but ultimately the parents have the final say in how they want their child to be handled", "NTA and you are sweet helping your sister this way. \n\nI have a couple of baby soothing suggestions.  Singing - babies will sometimes stop crying to listen to singing or whispers.  Reading books - even at 6 months a baby can get involved with books.  Pushing the baby in the stroller.", "NTA you are a very kind person.\nIf you left him alone to cry the whole time you would potentially be an A H but you held him, rocked him, sang to him.\nDefinitely NTA and gave his parents a much needed break.\nYou don\u2019t confess this until he graduates from high school though", "NTA. Babies cry. It\u2019s ok. You tried to soothe them, it didn\u2019t work, and that\u2019s ok. You made sure they were good and when nothing worked, you let them cry, no harm no foul. \n\nIt\u2019s good you didn\u2019t ruin their night, and I bet they needed the break, but maybe don\u2019t say anything until the kids older.

I\u2019m not trying to be harsh here, but my MIL did this to my son once, and I never let her watch him alone again. I did not let my kids cry. The baby must have been freaked out waking up in a new place with a different person, and no parent. I would have wanted to be called. It\u2019s not about what you can handle; it\u2019s about what the baby can handle, and what his parents want. The parents wanted something else, which they explicitly told you, and the baby was scared. You don\u2019t know what kind of a day the baby had to make that decision. Or what they\u2019re trying to accomplish by not letting him cry. Or wanting to know how long he slept to plan their day. You don\u2019t know these things. Do what the parent asks or text and ask.", "YTA.  Your sister and BIL are the parents in the situation, and your altruism doesn\u2019t get to trump their rights to make decisions for their kid.

(not laughing at what you did to the poor baby, but rather just your innocent cluelessness and messing up by trying to be nice lmao) \n\nI don't know too much about raising babies myself but from what I know parents can learn to distinguish between the different kind of cries and they usually cry for specific reasons.\n\nSo they'll cry because they have a specific need that needs to be fulfilled (food, attention, potty) or they're generally uncomfortable or in danger or whatever the case may be.\n\nSince you seem to have limited experience with babies, you should err on the side of caution and not take matters into your own hands.\n\nIf I were you, I'd tell your sister about what happened. Start by telling her you messed up and and you're really sorry and promise to never do it again and hope that she doesn't lose trust in you etc etc before explaining the incident to maybe soften the blow.", "YTA. Your sister gave you explicit instructions and it wasn't your place to decide you didn't need to follow them. I understand you had good intentions and didn't want to ruin their evening, but if that was your sister's concern, she wouldn't have told you to call her if he woke up.\n\nMAYBE If he had woken up and been fine, this would have been a more acceptable decision, but the fact that he was screaming most of the night until your sister got home and you still didn't call her is completely unacceptable. FWIW, I have a seven month old son, and while I've left him (awake) with family, I would have been furious if you not only disregarded my instructions, but also let my child scream without giving me the opportunity to come home and soothe him\n\nNo, it's probably not going to permanently damage him, and he'll probably be fine, but that doesn't make what you did okay", "YTA.

She asked you to do something. You decided you knew better than she did what she wanted. That makes you the automatic asshole.\n\nAs far as the baby goes, he'll be fine. But I'm going to call you a major AH again, because it sounds like he was screaming, and you were just sitting there. What was your \"best\" to make sure he was comfortable? Did you pick him up and hold him? Walk around carrying him? Sing to him? Give him something to bite against (he's at the right age to be teething)? Determine whether holding him on a position that applied pressure to his lower abdomen would relieve some of his distress?", "YTA - Not your kid, not your rules. If they find out, you'll have definitely broken their trust. Not ok.", "YTA - your sister set the ground rules, you broke them. If you didn\u2019t want to follow them or had concerns, you should have broached it at the beginning. I know you were trying to do a nice thing, but it\u2019s not your place to decide which rules are silly and you don\u2019t have to follow when it comes to their child.", "YTA, you did such a sisterly thing trying to let them have time but as a mother to hear my son was crying for an extended period of time and I wasn\u2019t told I\u2019d be fuming if it was stated as a boundary. \nYou may not traumatise him but you didn\u2019t respect her parenting choices and that\u2019s an AH thing to do", "**YTA**\n\nNot because you didn't call her immediately, which was actually very thoughtful of you, but because you didn't call her even after YOU WERE UNABLE TO SOOTHE HIM YOURSELF in a reasonably short period of time.  Given that he started crying soon after they left, I'd actually have called you a great sister and aunt if you'd ignored her instructions initially and just calmed him by yourself - parents are certainly not the only ones capable of or necessary for dealing with small upsets, and you would have saved her evening out.\n\nBut the fact is that your own judgement of this situation belies your lack of experience and understanding of how serious something like this could be. You're concerned about a 6-month-old's \"emotional distress\", but that should have been the LEAST of your worries when you consider an infant crying and in distress for hours. You mention that you fed him, and I assume changed his diaper, but again, those are only two minor possible issues, and you say that he was still crying and in distress. HE MAY HAVE BEEN IN PAIN, he may have been sick . . . a baby that age cannot tell you when there is something really wrong, and not everything presents with fever or obvious signs other than shrieking baby. Yes, it's possible that it was just gas, or teething, or colic . . . but those things are still VERY PAINFUL, and his parents would at least have been able to do something to relieve his pain.  \n\nWhen you have been told to call the parents under ANY circumstances of their infant's discomfort, and he presents with distress that is bad enough that he cries for HOURS even after changing, feeding, etc., then YOU CALL THEM. This isn't about \"emotional distress\", it's about the fact that you may have left an infant who cannot advocate for himself in actual PAIN for hours because you didn't want to interrupt his parents' date night. Given your inability to judge the seriousness of a situation or prioritise safely, I wouldn't leave you with my kid again if I were your sister.

I understand that OP was trying to be nice and giving her sister a break, but as a mom, my baby's needs are my first priority and just because baby was fed and safe does not mean that I would have been ok with him crying for so long. This would be a hard line for me and my spouse. And if we leave our baby with someone then we expect total honesty and for them to follow our rules or else there's no trust there. Yeah babies cry and some parents are ok with letting their babies cry it out, but there are also some parents who don't agree with that method and it sounds like OP's sister is part of the latter.

It was exhausting, but funny in a way.", "Guess what,all that crying can give them gas...so what I used to do I hold them belly side down over my arm and rock them.or something that smells like mom,like one of her shirts if baby missed her.no you weren't wrong.babies cry.My own daughter could not be put down for 2 months.but I needed to shower and she got over it lol", "NTA.  Babies cry.  It's not traumatizing unless their needs are never met.  Sometimes they cry and you never figure out why.  It's normal.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 emotionally traumatized him? He's a baby, they cry. Wtf.", "NTA. Parents of newborns need some adult time alone.", "Did the mom leave you food for the baby, and do you change the diaper? If she wants to rush right home after he wakes, sounds like she\u2019s breastfeeding but maybe didn\u2019t leave any for you to bottle feed?", "INFO: you say the baby wasn\u2019t hungry, did you feed them? Not sure if the mum is EBF or if you gave the child food etc.\n\nIf you are sure the baby is warm, clean, dry and fed, yeah.. sometimes babies just cry and won\u2019t be settled. If you didn\u2019t feed the baby and just assumed \u2018oh schedule means they shouldn\u2019t be hungry yet\u2019, then that\u2019s different", "NTA because your intentions were good, but OP, I would be LIVID if someone else decided I didn't need to tend to my baby when I'd made it clear I wanted to. This was not your call to make. I probably wouldn't tell your sister (because seriously I would be *incandescently* angry) but don't ever do it again.", "NTA. In fact, you're an awesome sister for putting up with that.\n\nBabies go through developmental stages where they're clingy to their moms. It's not going to kill the kid to fuss for a couple of hours while mom gets a date with dad.\n\nYou're a rockstar, OP.", "NTA - your fine, you did everything you needed to.", "NTA but also why I don\u2019t leave my baby with anyone lol never know what they aren\u2019t telling you.", "NTA I am confused about why she needs to rush home if he is awake..is this because of breastfeeding? That's a weird rule and it's not sustainable long term. I know you said they are stressed financially but maybe she should find some parenting classes for free or online from a reputable source. This is honestly very weird I keep reading why you wrote and I am so confused. I have raised my son, have been in family members close proximity since they are born and have many friends that have kids that I have known since newborns. No one I know has done that, and none of our kids that most are adults now have been traumatized for mommy not being around when they were babies or for crying as babies.", "Maybe you don\u2019t know that that is sooooo far from trauma that you feel bad. Don\u2019t. NTA.", "NTA, you didn't traumatize baby, don't worry\ud83d\ude02 Babies cry sometimes for smallest of reasons. If he was fed, clean and safe, it's really not a big deal. First time parenting is stressful and parents often overthink it. A basic example: I know a woman who went from jumping at every move of her first baby to sometimes simply letting the 4th baby cry saying: \"What can I do? I checked everything he might need, he probably just needs to cry a bit\"", "I\u2019m a first time mom to a 3 month old and do NOT tell your sister he was crying all night. I left my baby with my in-laws once and I came home to them saying \u201che cried the entire time\u201d I honestly wish they would\u2019ve lied to me because now I never want to leave him", "For all we know the baby has colic and there's really nothing you can do about the crying much; I've heard white noise helps though", "Isn't six months also around the time they start cutting teeth? Like, 1 month after sleep regression they start teething?", "> without having rush back home\n\nthey didn't have to rush back home. they wanted to be able to choose to rush back home if they decided it was the right thing to do. OP did not allow them to make that choice.", "It's not her place to \"train\" anyone else's baby", "It's because people see babies as a great way  to have a \"justified\"  power trip over another human (usually the mom). They don't really care about the baby's comfort and ridicule the mom for caring.  \"You don't owe him, I'll decide what's best for him better than you\" seems to be the general approach. If this was a man's dog, the votes would all be YTA, lol", "I have an eighth month old and this whole thread just confirms to me that genpop really doesn't have any respect for moms or pregnant people. Like, we are capable and we'll within our right to do decisions about our children and it is not up to anyone else to decide they're stupid and \"too anxious\" and just do with our baby as they please, ESPECIALLY in the first year. If this was a man and a dog, all the votes would be YTA.", "Plus exposing the baby to emotional distress before they're ready for it is actually harmful for their development, and THIS actually is how you get overly attached and anxious child. The people here don't know even the basics if child psychology", "Completely disagree. If my child was miserable with a babysitter I would want to know about it because I wouldn't be leaving them again until I was confident they were comfortable with it. For an older child that might look like spending more time with that caregiver with me close at hand. For a six-month-old baby it would probably look like waiting until they were a bit older. \n\nObviously the child won't be traumatised, but they were upset at the time, and that is not something I want for my children if it can be avoided. Plenty of people will think it would be extra to miss a birthday dinner to comfort a baby, but it doesnt matter if they think it's the stupidest thing in the world - it should be *my* decision about *my* child and I would be furious if someone presumed to make it for me.", "My nephew had acid reflux. He would cry all day every day. He once cried for for 9 straight hours while I was watching him. He\u2019s 12 now. Thankfully stopped crying lol", "That's for the mum to decide, not the babysitter.", "How patronising. Different people make different parenting choices.", "Clearly you have never spent long bouts of time with children. This is completely normal. Sometimes you do everything you can and they still cry.", "The only thing she's doing wrong is not being the mom of the child, the baby had separation anxiety because it's the age for that and the mom never leaves her kid.", "Thank you for the kind words. So far so good. I'm lucky so far she is a happy little baby full of smiles. For now\ud83d\ude02", "So what you're saying is the mom had a kid babysit but despite all the instructions she left out the fact that the kid was sick in any way shape or form... OP did a solid to the parents. Some parents are just overprotective.", "It sounded better in your head didn't it?", "Yes!!!", "I remember once I was babysitting kids, for two weeks every morning from 9 -12 because their mother was setting up her classroom. So they were I think like 3 and 5 and they were nice kids but a lot of work. I never told their mom anything i just said they were great. One day they were SO BAD and the house was a mess, when their mom got home I laughed and said oh they were a little rowdy today. Well she did not stop talking about it. She felt terrible. She was like I told my husband I can't believe they were rowdy we talked to them. I was like it wasn't a big deal..I regretted saying anything", "YOU MONSTER", "I have always responded to my children crying. My oldest is four now and I function just fine.", "I\u2019m not saying OP didn\u2019t take care of the baby. If you think that\u2019s my point you\u2019re clearly mistaken", "So working parents with kids in daycare are scaring their kids for life and their kids are just surviving not thriving? What an incredibly entitled viewpoint. And what will you do with a second child when the first still needs you for something?", "Got it! I thought you were referring to OP", "Both my kids cried A LOT.  My son was just colicky and my daughter had significant health/developmental issues.  My son is 19 and is amazing.  Daughter is 16 and doing fine.  Neither is scarred for life.", "If you need to work, it's different than wanting to go for a date. It's lesser of two evils kind of situation, where the kid's emotional discomfort is still lesser evil to hunger and eviction. Btw the US and it's culture of working moms of tiny babies if fucked up imo. Yes it's harmful to the babies, definitely. The anxiety epidemic doesn't come from nowhere (not saying this is the only factor, but it IS absolutely a factor).\n\nPlus working parents DECIDE they won't be available to baby for x amount of hours. That is their right. Same as it's another parent right to decide they can and want to actually fulfill their babies need in the first year (being close to parents I'd a vital need for babies and each kid outgrows it at their own pace). Why do you see one decision as worthy of respect, but not the other one?\n\nAddressing older child's need is usually done with the baby strapped to yourself where I live. What entitlement to think the US way is the only way. Many cultures baby carry and fullfil kid's every need during the FIRST year of their life.\n\nRegardless of all this, this is still all up to the PARENTS to decide. Not MIL, not SIL, not the sitter's.", "Oh! Lol I might have been unclear because I was just flabbergasted but trying to be respectful of others' parenting choices.", "Right? I have had to leave my son to go to work - partly necessity and partly choice because of my life experiences. He's a smart, sweet little boy who doesn't seem worse for it.", "Your comments are dripping with judgement, disdain and condescension towards people who parent differently than you. Get off your high horse, stick your head in a bucket of cold water and get over yourself. I'm not even a parent and I already want to shake the smugness out of you.", "Your comments were judgmental and rude - yes obviously different cultures parent differently but reread your post as if someone was saying that to you in person.  \n\nI don't presume that the US is doing it best either - living here I know it sucks. But comments like yours are awful towards women who choose differently than you did for a variety of reasons and I don't think geography makes being rude and dismissive towards others any more polite.", ">Plus working parents DECIDE they won't be available to baby for x amount of hours.\n\nLOL. They decide huh?"]}
