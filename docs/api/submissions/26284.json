I have friends who have been ghosted by their friends after coming out and it seems to be something that still hurts them. I told her that she get over herself and talk to her and not to be one of those people who thought coming out meant she had a crush on her or something like that. \n\nShe did seem take it well for some time but she has been avoiding me ever since and blocked me on all social media which is pretty odd from her tbf.

Why do you expect her to want to engage with you after you immediately lashed out at her over something she was trying to work her feelings out over? It doesn't sound like she'd done anything harmful, she was just processing her thoughts.", "Soft YTA. As a queer person myself, I think you were coming from a good place where you were trying to be an ally and defend the queer community, because there *are* people that make someone else's coming out about themselves.\n\nBut with the close relationship here, and your sister coming to you for advice in the past, I think you should have been more patient in your response to her. It seems like you jumped to the conclusion about what she was feeling fucked up about it, when she would have benefitted from you helping her to examine her feelings more closely. She's not an adult and she shouldn't be held to the same standards; there's so much to figure out about yourself and the world as a teenager! She could have been feeling strange about her friend's coming out for any number of reasons, and even if the reason was that stereotypical/homophobic one, it's more helpful at this age to talk calmly about biases like this, to do some reflection about why she might feel that way and how she can go about challenging such biases, rather than getting called out as harshly as she did.\n\nEdit: for typos", "It's a maybe from me.\n\nI think you projected a lot of your past experience with friend ghosting after someone come out. Did you have a real conversation with your sisters about why she is feeling that way, because it doesn't seem like it in your post.\n\nThere is a lot of reason why your sister could feel upset, some might be bigoted, but now all of them. Maybe you sister had a talk about sexuality with you friend before and was pushed back by that friend who now come out bi and she feel the friend was an hypocrite. Maybe she was one of the last of her friend informed and she feel left out. Maybe she struggle with question about her own sexuality and her friend coming out pushed those question at the surface. Maybe her friend had inappropriate behavior with her sister that now make a lot more sense, but make your sister question their friendship. Maybe she doesn't really know herself why she have those negative feelings.\n\nNot saying your sister can't be upset for a bad reason, I don't know her. But your sister was trying to talk to you about her feeling and you seem to have gone into judging mode rather quickly. Probably a better idea to figure for sure why your sister feel this way before judging her harshly on it.\n\nAnyway, don't be surprised if your sister don't really want to confine in you next time she have strong feelings about something.", "YTA- You projected your life experience onto what your sister was trying to tell you. \n\nYou know how this could have gone?  You could have asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d That\u2019s it. Then let your sister safely vent whatever is making her feel this way. Would her reasons have been valid? We\u2019ll never know. It could be anything from your sister being a raging homophobe to feeling sad that her friend didn\u2019t tell her sooner to your sister questioning her own sexuality in light of this news. But now she\u2019s not talking to her friend OR you.\n\nThis is most likely fixable, but you have to fix it. Tell her you need to talk. Explain - with examples - what you\u2019ve seen people go through and how her comment triggered that in you. Then say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I got angry without listening. Please tell me what\u2019s going on. We need each other and your friend needs you.\u201d\n\nHurry up and go talk to her.", "INFO- did you ever find out why she felt upset about it?", "The only person I ever felt weird about their coming out was a friend who had always acted a little weird around me.  Lots of little things like touching too much and staring too long.  I'd brushed it off as her just being a little awkward and me reading too much into things.\n\nAnd... no.  It was very much her being creepy, knowing I wasn't interested, and trying to find ways to push me into things she knew I wasn't okay with.\n\nSo yeah. She came out. Was aware that I was bi, and was *furious* that I still wasn't interested in her after she came out.  I felt *really* weird about losing a friend that way.\n\nBeing judgemental and shutting your sister down didn't help her learn anything and may have hurt her when she needed support.", "YTA. \n\nAs a bisexual woman myself, I would much rather have a younger teen spoken to about what was upsetting her to help her work through those feelings in a positive way. Now, all your sister has learned is that you're not as close as she thought, and you'll throw her under the bus immediately for whatever imaginary \"ally\" points you think you've just been gifted.\n\nYou have no idea why your sister was upset.\n\nIs she biphobic?\n\nIs she upset that her best friend felt like she couldn't be open and honest about her sexuality with her?\n\nIs she conflicted because she might be questioning her own sexuality?\n\nIf her best friend came out to your sister and her family, was that all at once and an overall awkward experience for her? \n\nDid she and her best friend have a fake-flirty set of jokes between them that your sister is now reevaluating?\n\nYou have no idea, because you would rather be dismissive instead of actually sit down and listen to the sister you're supposed to love and care about.\n\nEven if it boils down to the idea that your sister has biphobic beliefs, if you were actually an ally and actually loved your sister, you would have talked her through them and helped her see the wrong in that biphobia so she could grow and be a better person.\n\nThat'll be the last time she goes to you for advice.", "YTA\n\nThis comes off as you blew up on your sister without even hearing her out. She said she felt fucked up about it and has been depressed. Did you bother finding out what exactly she feels fucked up about or did you just ASSUME that she was being homophobic? Have you ever known your sister to be homophobic? There\u2019s no reason, from anything you\u2019ve said, that your sister would be judging her friend. It\u2019s actually you being the judgmental one.", "YTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t even give her a chance to explain how she was feeling. Not only did you not help your sister, you also definitely didn\u2019t help her friend who just came out", "YTA. I feel like you came off too judgy. And yes you did dismiss her feelings. You could've had a more constructive conversation with her. It's good that you feel that strongly about this subject though, but instead of losing your patience you could've listened more about why she was feeling \"fucked up\" about it.... And if she gave you an irrational answer, THEN you can start to lose your patience \ud83e\udd74 Did she even tell you the real reason?", "YTA at no point do you say that you talked to your sister about why she felt \"fucked up\" about it. You just made assumptions and told her to get over it. Fucked up is not an emotion. She may have felt worried about how it would affect their relationship, it may have caused her to question her own sexuality but you have no idea because you didn't actually talk to her.", "YTA. News is news and we all take information differently. Congrats you have gone through enough things to handle situations (good or bad) about these things. Your sisters hasn't. She's younger than you. Instead of talking through her thoughts and feelings you blew up. That's not healthy and that's not fair to someone who has less experience than you, let alone a family member you claim to be close with.", "YTA - 16 year olds are not perfect at processing new shit. You could have helped her out instead of throwing it back in her face.\n\nIt sounds like you got angry at her before you even found out why she feels upset.", "NTA. Your sister was being a dick to her friend- you never just GHOST someone. That\u2019s such an asshole move. Someone needed to tell her that.", "NTA\n\nYour sister needs a wakeup call and you gave it to her.\n\n\\*Unless the coming out came with a confession of a crush on your sister, but I am sure that you would have included that information if it occurred that way.\n\nHer friend's mental health and need for support during this delicate time is way more important than your sister's weird feelings.", "NTA, your sister needs to grow up and realize that her actions have consequences. One of them is that being homophobic will cost you friends.", "NTA. And i don't get all the Y T A votes lmao.", "NTA, time for your sister to grow up and learn the world is not black and white.", "tbh, the facts that the friend came out and it made the sister feel 'weird' is kinda giving homophobic.", "NTA it doesn't sound like you lost your shit or started screaming or anything, you just explained why ghosting someone right after they come out to you might have a negative impact. I would still reach out to your sister and try to smooth things over though, explain you weren't trying to dismiss what she's feeling but that if shes feeling weird about the situation her bi friend is likely feeling way, way worse about it all", "Soft YTA? Look, teens aren't known for their amazing sense of self and deep introspection, or their nimble ability to process information gracefully. Your instinct is good-protecting people against homophobia and pain is valuable and needed. But yelling at a kid for not handling new information amazingly never works, and generally only makes them ashamed or double down. You have no idea why your sister is feeling weird. Maybe her friend's new info opened up some questions for herself that she's processing, or maybe she a raging homophobe-you don't know because you made it clear you weren't up for any kind of conversation. You could try to reach out and apologize for your initial reaction, and see of she would be willing to try again.", "NTA Making her friend's coming out all about her? I am not surprised.", "NTA. \n\nIf they\u2019re *really* best friends, she would have been supportive of her rather than apparently turning into **that** kind of person; that makes it about them and assumes they must be telling them because they have a romantic interest in them. Honestly, in this day and age I\u2019m surprised your sister was weirded out by it but I guess that partially depends on various factors such as religion, upbringing, etc.", "NTA- There\u2019s simply no reason to be upset about the sexuality of a friend unless you\u2019re insecure with your own sexuality or just don\u2019t like bi people. Maybe I\u2019m biased because i had to mature quickly but i would never do this at 16.", "Well, tbh you are right. I had my best friend from High School ghost me. It\u2019s been 17 years. She cried when she found out I was gay. I guess she liked me BUT things were never the same after that and the world was a different place then than it is today. \n\nWe were 3 years from the country almost passing a Bush II era Amendment to ruin our lives. I hope that she doesn\u2019t be mean to her friend.", "YTA\nAnd the only reason I'm saying this is because you seem to be lacking the gossipy cell in your body. \nYou should've asked why she was feeling like that. Is she biphobic? Does she think her friend likes her and that's why she came out? If not to help her, for the sake of gossip you should be asking the important questions", "NTA. Quite frankly anyone saying you\u2019re in the wrong or trying to justify your sister\u2019s reaction is normalising biphobia and bigotry.", "ESH. Yeah, she shouldn't be acting so weird over her friend's sexuality. Her friend is still the same person, so there's no reason to get so weird about it. But you didn't help by berating her. If anything, you probably just reinforced her beliefs instead of challenging them.", "You gave your sister's opinion precisely the respect it deserved and she didn't like it. NTA.", "Soft YTA. I completely understand your frustration as a queer trans dude. The only reason I didn\u2019t get dumped by my straight friends after coming out was bc I never had any to begin with lmao. I was easily clocked as gay and they generally weren\u2019t interested in hanging out with me. But close straight friends getting weird and distant after you come out has definitely happened to many ppl I know and is a common experience. And yeah, it does hurt them still years later. It\u2019s a hurt you learn to live with and it lessens over time, but you don\u2019t ever forget that emotion. \n\nThat being said, I think this could have been a really good teaching moment. You had an opportunity to guide your sister towards being a more empathetic and understanding person, but she obviously didn\u2019t respond well to you snapping at her. I don\u2019t think this is a lost cause though; you have a longstanding close relationship with each other. My guess is she\u2019s feeling some hurt, embarrassment, shame, and anger right now. She a teenager with big feelings. Once she unblocks you, I\u2019d try having the conversation again and reiterate that you love her while discussing why she feels weird about this and encouraging her to think about how her friend might be feeling after coming out and immediately being avoided by her bff for a week. I believe in you in you op!!", "Honestly, my opinion is NAH. You were wrong with how you talked to your sister though, and you should apologize for that. Next time, just try and talk to her instead of assuming what she's going to do.", "NTA. Her blocking you and avoiding you may not be because of something 'stupid' you did. I have a feeling that she maybe embarrassed or ashamed that she did something bad and had you corrected her in an outburst. Sixteen is a volatile age for many, she maybe very sensitive and take your words badly. \n\nIf you talk to her again, saying sorry for losing your patience maybe a good start for her to know that although her confused thoughts are harmful and bad to her friend, it is a learning moment and she can get over and change those initial feelings, whatever they are.", "Yta your telling your sister she needs to act a certain way what if being around gay or bi people make her uncomfortable. Witch she has a right to . Personally I don\u2019t get this fascination with everyone wanting to tell everybody there business , then they all scream don\u2019t label me then they label themselves smh", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The good news is that the teenaged years are a great time to teach someone to start becoming aware of those internalized biases and challenging them! \n\nAs a queer myself who grew up in a conservative family with more explicit homophobia, I had a lot of internalized biases to overcome. Instead of condemning op's sister before we even know why she's upset, op could have (and still could) used this as a teaching/learning moment to make sister examine her feeling about this critically.\n\nAnd then, as several people in the comments have mentioned, there's a non-zero chance that op's sister feels \"fucked up\" about this because she's struggling with her own sexuality in some way.

You can't just come home with a partner of the same sex the same way people come home with partners of the opposite sex because most of the time the latter doesn't require you to explain anything.", "Objectively, you jumping to \"bi girl is a sexual predator\" is part of long standing homophobic tropes rooted in made up excuses for being homophobic. Anyone else jumping to \"she's a bit homophobic\" is just a statistical probability. You trying to equate the two is trying to put a literal excuse for legal discrimination on equal footing with the experiences of queer people that actually are supported by fact and statistic, and not the frequently used argument in this thread of being just \"anecdata\". They are not equivalent in likelihood or weight.", "Why? Why is it ridiculous to compare racism to homophobia?", "I never said she was a sexual predator, YOU put those words in my mouth.", "WTH are you talking about? Never did they even insinuate that the \u201cbi girl is a sexual predator\u201d. If a straight man tres to pick up a lesbian woman and she informs him she\u2019s lesbian, that\u2019s doesn\u2019t automatically make him a sexual predator. How are you doing these mental gymnastics to put these words in their mouth?", "You know what I just looked at your post history and I completely understand why you behave the way you do.", "Jesus Christ you are ignorant."]}
