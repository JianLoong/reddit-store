That's never okay.  It isn't like they met casually out in public. He just has to understand he cannot flirt with or ask out a client - ever. Not the time or place. I don't care if it's the love of his life, he's needs to understand he can't act on his feelings under those circumstances. Ever. (Did I say ever enough? Can you tell I feel strongly about this? Not sure how else to phrase how inappropriate it would be to flirt or ask her out in her home or use her number.)", "It's still not appropriate to ask out customers.

So shut the fuck up when your aren\u2019t interacting with people who are \u201cin season\u201d or in a socially acceptable place to shoot the shot, like a dating app, or a singles night  at a bar.

Safety first.", "No, you would not be TA, you seriously need to report this, to the police, but also to his place of employment, because he used information obtained through work for \"personal\" stalking. Such actions should have consequences, severe ones at that.

Police, now!  This is creepy, and you have great instincts.  Please make sure you get some excellent security, put two names on your mail box (one of them male), and make sure your outgoing phone message is male.  And maybe learn some self defense. Yikes.  The notion that you don't get to make this horrible guy angry (understandably) makes my head hurt.  Forgive me for fantasizing about weaponry.", "It is certainly creepy and unacceptable behavior.  Like you said, boundary issues at the least.  After blocking him, has he tried to contact you in any way?   If not, calling cops/boss might be unnecessary.

Make sure you have a way to tell who is at your door before you open it and make sure you have some way to make friends aware of danger or to know to come looking for you if you don\u2019t respond after a certain period of time.
