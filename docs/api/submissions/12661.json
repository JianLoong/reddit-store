Calling people that are strangers by their nickname is weird. You don't know them to be addressing them that way. Nicknames are usually for people that are close good friends, not strangers.

Not everything is about you and what you want.", "YTA\n\nUnless they\u2019re a friend or only go by a nickname, call people their actual name until they say otherwise.", "YTA. Some people do have special names that are between them and people they're close to. That's a privilege they've given to their friend/part of the bond they have with them. You swooping in and calling them something you haven't earned from them can be abrasive. If someone is introduced to you as 'Amanda', you call them 'Amanda', unless they say \"Call me Amy/Mandy\". That's the only time you should be allowed to call someone a 'nickname'. \n\nYou might not recognize it, but what you're doing comes off very fake and invasive. You're coming into the middle of someone's relationship/friendship and trying to force it to be more than you've earned through time spent with them by using a petname/nickname. Don't do that. You're really going to piss off more people than not, and I bet more people are mad at you but are nonconfrontational and are just quietly seething and resenting you.", "YTA.

I have a nick name my bully gave me. But my best friend turned it around for me. It is not very good but when he says it, i know he means it in a good way and not trying to be mean. But i don't like when others call me that. Your friends name might have a history like that.", "YTA. The fact that over the years multiple people have not liked you doing this should have clued you in. Call people what they introduce themselves as.

Yes, a lot of people don't like to be called by their nicknames by random people. You are a stranger to them. \nAnd as a woman I'd like to add that calling us by a nickname or a diminutive comes off as condescending. \nRegardless, you call a person by the name THEY TELL YOU, NEVER by the name others call them. \n\nMy school friends call me by my school nickname. I don't particularly like it, but it's like an inside joke so I allow it for the old times' sake. When their partners pick it up I always tell them off.

And most people don't mind at all when I find out what their nickname is and call them using that", "Exactly. I have a name that has a LOT of various nicknames and I usually tell people which they can use after getting to know them a little. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019d like if someone just started using one of them without me saying, \u201cOh you can call me __nickname__.\u201d \n\nYTA, OP.", "And depending on people some nicknames are reserved for different friends/social circles. It's safe to assume you shouldn't call someone a certain thing unless you ask first, even if you actually are friends.", "its very much intentional if people have shown dislike of his usage of nicknames.", "Exactly, that's why I was surprised by her reaction. I told her that something like this is not a big a deal", "heyyyy sweetie", "Or you know, by their name", "What did she introduce herself as? YTA for not calling her whatever name she told you. \n\n\n\nYou knew \"beforehand\" when you never got permission to call her something different beforehand.", "That\u2019s not the issue. The issue is you learning about it and then telling her to essentially lighten up.", "Of course you could have. \u201cHey do you prefer Nory or Noreen?\u201d It\u2019s an easy question to ask.", "You couldn't have known because you didn't know her. Stop calling strangers by nicknames you overhear other people calling them. You're overstepping.", "When she met you did she introduce herself by her name or her nickname?", "Per your own post, you call people by nicknames to \u201cmake the friendship seem closer\u201d\u2026except if you WERE CLOSE FRIENDS you would have known this co-worker did not want you to call them by said nickname. \n\nFriendship requires knowledge about and experiences with someone, along with respect.  You don\u2019t seem to have any of that since you\u2019ve never asked these people if it\u2019s even okay to use nicknames outside of what they introduced themselves as.", "\u201chey i heard x calling you y, what name do you prefer i call you?\u201d", "That is why you ask her before you call her by her nickname.", "of course not, and if you want to take the risk, fine.\n\nBUT, she then informed you she did not like you doing so, and instead of simply listening and amending it, you decided to react dismissively and like a bit of an asshole.\n\nso yes, YTA", "You did know it was exclusive when your colleague told you it was and you told her to lighten up. That\u2019s where you\u2019re the AH.", "You could\u2019ve asked that. It\u2019s not that uncommon for nicknames being exclusively used by people that are close to that person. Just ask the person first", "Hi -insert name- I notice sometimes you get called  (insert nickname) what do you prefer I call you? \nEasy - absolutely no drama necessary", "Unless someone comes up to you and tells you you can call them something, you don't call them something. It's like hearing their s/o call them 'baby' or some cute relationship pet name and calling them that. Or are you aware enough to know that's not going to fly? Because you're trying to force a friendship level that you're clearly not at if someone hasn't said 'hey, call me (nickname)'.", "It's overly familiar and jarring if you're not friends. Address people as the the name they introduce themselves with.", "Unless you KNOW you are allowed to use it, don't.", "They probably do, they just don't think it's worth a fight. Stop snooping on other people's lives in order to create the illusion of closeness you haven't earned. Asshole.", "I mean, generally the name someone uses to introduce themselves to you is the name you should call them until you're invited to do otherwise, or ask their permission to do so. Assuming that you can just use a nickname is a quick way to get yourself known as \"the annoying nickname person\", and if what your coworker says is true, it sounds like you already have and should probably stop. Just because not everyone is as blunt as \"Nory\" about it doesn't mean that they're *actually* okay with it, or why you started doing it even if they're okay with you using it, just that they're not as willing to make a fuss.", "You didn\u2019t know initially, but now you do know it\u2019s exclusive. So if you want to not be an Asshole, stop calling them what they don\u2019t want to be called. That\u2019s the opposite of being friendly. \n\nYTA", "You could ask them if you can call them by their nickname... It aint that hard.", "Uhm\u2026 ask?", "you know by asking *BEFORE* you use it.", "I think you can take an educated guess, William to Will is unlikely to be exclusive. My family call me bear. My name is Elizabeth, as a kid I was called Lizzy Bear and it got shortened at some point to just bear. My husband to he doesn\u2019t call me bear, even though he\u2019s around my family who use it. If it\u2019s not a straight forward name shortening then I wouldn\u2019t risk it", "When people ask you to stop, just stop. It's that simple. What if someone likes to greet people by smacking you in your family jewels and then complain on aita when you said no?", "How people introduce themselves to you... is how they want you to address them.  Period! Has nobody taught you normal social interaction?", "You do have a way to know. Say, \u201cWhat name do you prefer to go by?\u201d Or, \u201cWhat do you like to be called?\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019ve heard people call you [nickname]. Would you prefer I call you that too?\u201d", "Then just use the nickname of people who ARE comfortable with. Just because some people tolerate your shit, doesn't mean others have to bear it too.", "Ask people what they prefer", "It's a person's right to choose how they want to be addressed.

A couple kids picked up on it, and the nickname kid didn\u2019t like it. We had ONE brief conversation as a class and now no one else uses the nickname. If five year olds can understand it, then you can understand it.

If they didn't stop after being told to do so, that's very much intentional.", "No no I mean her reaction isn\u2019t a big deal, you\u2019re really not supposed to tell her that, as long as you correct your behavior and move on there was no point in posting this.", "Boy did you miss the point.", "Respect her boundaries.  She said no. You said the equivalent of \"Oh come on. It's OK that I did it. You know it's fine. Stop being a prude\". \n\nThink about it.
