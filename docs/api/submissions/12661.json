Some people do have special names that are between them and people they're close to. That's a privilege they've given to their friend/part of the bond they have with them. You swooping in and calling them something you haven't earned from them can be abrasive. If someone is introduced to you as 'Amanda', you call them 'Amanda', unless they say \"Call me Amy/Mandy\". That's the only time you should be allowed to call someone a 'nickname'. \n\nYou might not recognize it, but what you're doing comes off very fake and invasive.

For the first 5 years of our marriage, I only heard him called \u201cWill\u201d occasionally, and only ever by his best friend. Then we moved to a new neighborhood and started attending a new church congregation. For some reason, even though he always introduces himself as \u201cWilliam,\u201d everyone at church calls him \u201cWill\u201d - and it drives him up the wall. (My suspicion is that it started because someone mixed him up with another \u201cWilliam\u201d at church who *does* go by \u201cWill,\u201d and then it spread due to exactly the sort of thing OP talked about - people overheard the nickname and assumed they can/should use it too.)", "i know people who use a self-assumed nickname (as in that\u2019s what they introduce themselves to people as)\n\ni also love having nicknames for my friends, the same way I do secret handshakes with my friends, inside lingo, etc., it gives a little extra bond with those friendships.\n\nthis case feels more like someone using someone else\u2019s pet name/nickname in an effort to force familiarity.", "If I heard someone being called something different to what I know them as, I would ask them which they prefer.

I thought the whole reason was to be friendly.", ">multiple co-workers have a problem with your behavior\n\nYeah - OP's getting a negative reaction from some and a neutral reaction from others, and figures he should keep doing it.\n\nI wonder whether OP's ever accidentally used a version of an intimate nickname not realizing it was intimate.  \"My wife calls me that because of this one thing we do in bed, and OP calls me that because he overheard it and he lacks social awareness, politeness, and propriety.\"", "YESSS THISSS. \nI cant put my finger on it but OP comes off a certain way and i cant explain it. If some dude had overheard my best friend call me a nickname and later on he calls me it, id be very creep out and then for him to dismiss her boundary is even more weird.", "Similar to your husband, I have a name like James. In general I go by the short \u201cJim\u201d version of my name, and in my entire life there are 2 people who\u2019ve gotten away with using the \u201cJimmy\u201d version. One was my best friend through high school and the other was a kid I coached who was so excited about something he ran to me with a huge smile shouting \u201cJimmy!\u201d And it stuck. That\u2019s it. No one else.", "My name also has a few different shortened forms. One of them is the one I introduce myself by and my friends and coworkers use. One only my parents and siblings got away with using since they called me that since I was a baby and couldn\u2019t choose", "I call my husband \"Sweetum Doodle.\" \n\nHis coworkers, on the other hand, do not.", "The worse people I've ever met are those who insist on how friendly they are. They have no concept of boundaries or personal space. I've been hugged, got my back slapped, glomped unexpectedly by \"friendly\" people. \n\nAnd whenever you tell them to back off because you're not comfortable with them getting into your personal space, they act all offended and treat it like you're the unreasonable one because they were just being fRIeNdLy!\n\nLike seriously OP, YTA. Back off and stop treating people, especially your colleagues, like they're your BFFs when you only barely know them and it's mostly a professional working relationship. A smile and a \"good day\" is more friendly that whatever it is you're doing right now.", "It\u2019s pretty common for HR to intervene when people are using the wrong name. \n\nThis case might not be harassment but I\u2019m guessing if all the employees who don\u2019t like it went to HR they consider that appropriate to intervene.", "Can I call him that though?", "This is the phrase i've needed to have put together for me for awhile now, thank you. got a couple guys at work that are precisely this, and i've been struggling with feeling like an asshole for not liking them, but you've made sense of the situation for me!\n\ni also vote YTA.", "My brother almost exclusively goes by a nickname bud a whopping two people call him by his full first. I also almost exclusively go by a nickname. But if we introduce ourselves as our full first it\u2019s rude to go straight to our nicknames if we haven\u2019t given consent ya know?", "Only if you mean it. \ud83d\ude04", "OMG the song thing. My name is similiar to a very popular song, often sung at sporting events now for some reason, and I LOATHE it when people sing that at me because, and I can't stress this enough, it isn't actually my name.", "Every person I know who has a name that also has a famous song (Amanda, Brandy, etc) *hates* the song particularly because people constantly sing it at them.  As such my personal policy is to never even mention the name songs as a common sense kind of policy.", ">But yes OP YTA because she told you a boundary and you should have simply said \"I didn't know that I'm sorry \" and moved on\n\nExactly, the real problem is doubling down when a boundary is set. Otherwise, it was just a relatively small transgression.\n\nThere are many reasons people make such mistakes: being neuro-divergent, growing up in a family with poor boundaries, being generally sheltered and naive, cultural differences and so on.\n\nBut OP didn't make a mistake: this is his *chosen* strategy to make \"a friendship *feel* closer\" (to him) and according to his colleague, other people are also bothered by his use of nicknames. His post comes across as very dismissive of others and he openly states that because he \"doesn't mind\" and doesn't \"feel\" these people actually dislike it, the fact that they say themselves they dislike it isn't valid or true. Which is wild.", "This was my thought. Nicknaming conventions were something I grasped in early childhood. The daughter of our new neighbours was named Georgia. Her friends called her Gia and her family Gigi. I remember being excited when she told me I could call her Gia, and understanding implicitly that that didn\u2019t mean I could call her Gigi too.\n\nIt reads like OP identified something friends do and then tried to apply it universally without context.", "Named my son Matthew.  I have *never* called him Matt.  He introduces himself as Matthew.  Most people (unlike OP!) either call him his full name or ask if he minds being called Matt.\n\nMost of the time, he doesn't mind - *because they asked!*", "Yes! The doubling down and defensiveness just makes it worse. Shows the use of the nickname was about OP\u2019s feelings, not the person they supposedly wanted to befriend", "Your remark makes me realize there just might be an element of need-to-control with people who insist and persist with nicknaming. I will call people what they wish to be called. Some genuinely don't care. Others go into porcupine mode. I respect the wishes.", "I have shut people DOWN over trying to call me Sammy. Like, stop the conversation, give them the stink eye, and state \"I am NOT a Sammy\". Mostly due to Days of Our Live's Sami, lol.", "I hate this, too, and it's very California. I was honestly stunned the first time I attended a Mass out here and people HUGGED during the peace offering. Um, that doesn't play in New England, lol.", "Agreed. I have a lot of trouble with social cues and facial expressions so I cannot tell when someone doesn't like something I do or if I come across rude. But when someone tells me when I'm doing something that comes across in anl negative way I'm grateful to be aware and I Stop doing that thing (even if it feels normal or fine to me). OPs problem isn't the social cues or knowing boundaries. His problem is ACCEPTING a boundary as a boundary and being respectful of it instead if dismissing it altogether.\nTherapy, OP. It does wonders.", "I counter with \"and I'm riddled with PTSD!\" while backing away hands up. \n\nSome will look at you funny and walk away, others will check themselves and chill", "awww\n\nbetter to learn earlier than later I guess", "That\u2019s hilarious!"]}
