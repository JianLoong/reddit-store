He said over and over he would at least do the dishes (piled up in the sink, kitchens a mess), laundry (2 piles to be folded and probably 2-3 loads need to go in), and vacuum since his lab sheds like crazy.

He doesn\u2019t come in until a little after 2:00. I asked him wtf he\u2019s been doing, he says he\u2019s had an upset stomach and then got caught up playing some card game on his phone on the porch. Meanwhile I can\u2019t walk to the kitchen so I\u2019m starving too, but whatever. Then once I press him about how absent he\u2019s been, he confessed he was looking for a porn video to masturbate to since we can\u2019t have sex right now and I\u2019m not in the mood to do other sexual things since I\u2019m in pain. \n\nI don\u2019t care if he watches porn.
