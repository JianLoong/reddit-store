I explained that there would be no need for a college girl in a big city to have a car. She then asked if I could help with tuition, I did not pay for trade school either so I declined. Eventually she seemed down so I offered to buy a used car in my name, and she could use it for a while until I decided to sell it but she would have to maintain it. She seemed really happy with that so we got an old 99 BMW for really cheap.

I offered to pay her back for the half of the paintwork.\n\nAITA here?\n\nEDIT: ok seems people think it was wrong, but my son only got the truck after schooling and my daughter has not finished school yet. I have not thought of her graduation gift yet. But the car is only listed and I will think about it and reconsider.\n\nEDIT2: Ok i will let her keep it and de-list it for now.

Or, giving her the money from selling it.\n\nWhen I used bribery on one of mine, I ALWAYS made sure the other got rewarded for accomplishments, since I grew up with asshat parents (like you) that believed that exceptional effort and success were meant to be the default state, so no reward.
