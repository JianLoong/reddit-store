Unmmm he can do that when yours has doubled where it was when he was unemployed and living off you. I find it hard to believe that he couldn\u2019t find some sort of job, unless he lacked desire to be anything more than a bum. Don\u2019t waste time on people that only care about themselves.

Not sure why he thinks he should get a free ride.\n\nEdit to add: You should consider asking him to replenish your savings that you used on him to be put Before his own investment property.

To me, since he is your partner he should be paying a nominal amount of rent and 1/2 utilities. It\u2019s true he won\u2019t gain anything from the mortgage but he would be paying less than standard rent in the area so he can save the additional amount for his own place if he wishes. If he thinks paying rent to you is unfair then he should definitely go pay full rent elsewhere rather than getting a good deal living with you.", "NTA.  He should pay rent.  Just because you own the house doesn't mean he gets a free ride.", "NTA and if he refuses to help with co-living expenses, get a new boyfriend, he sounds like a mooch who is taking advantage of you.", "He's right. Never pay half on property if your name is not on the deed.  \n\n\nPay rent, sure. But that works out to be much, much less.", "NAH while half of the total payment per month is too much, half of the utilities is too less. Either he pays half of all and gets equity in % that he payed, or he pays you rent which should be lower than the half of everything.", "NAH. It's a tricky situation, I admit. Him only contributing to utilities is too little, paying exactly half is also too much (imo). I moved in with a partner who owned the property we lived in, and I paid rent (I wouldn't have been comfortable not doing so), because if I wasn't with him and lived elsewhere, I'd have to pay rent anyway (and more, because what I was paying for rent at my partner's place was like 1/3rd of market value for the type of place it was). That said, without your partner being there, you would also still be legally obligated to pay your full mortgage amount, so you also benefit from having him around paying, despite the fact he gets to claim no legal ownership of the house. \n\nTL;DR: You need to find a happy medium you both agree to that isn't nothing but that also isn't 50%.", "So ESH.\n\nYou should not be expecting him to pay your mortgage. It's YOUR mortgage, and it's YOUR property. Having him contribute to the mortgage payments isn't really a good idea for either of you unless you are willing to draw up legal documents to give him rights in the property equal to the amount he pays of the mortgage. If you just have him pay half of it for years with no written agreement and you split, he could very well sue you. It's better just to have a legal agreement dictating how things are split if you separate, or for you to just pay your mortgage on your own.\n\nIf you foot the mortgage bill on your own, there's zero question about ownership and you legally and morally owe him nothing in that regard should you split down the line.\n\nHowever, if you feel he is not contributing enough you should draw up a full write up of your bills and expenses and have him split more than just utilities. Do you have internet, cable, Netflix, etc.? How are groceries split? A lot of couples who have this same issue have the non-mortgage paying partner contribute to these expenses.\n\nIf you think that what he wants is not reasonable, have him move out or draft an official rental agreement where he pays you an agreed upon sum to reside there. Just be aware that the rental agreement can strain relationships. You're then invoking a landlord/tenant kind of relationship, and that's not usually great for relationships.\n\nEDIT: You're going to be hit with a lot of comments that say that since he would have to pay a landlord somewhere else he might as well pay you. Try to realize this is not a good excuse to make your boyfriend pay your mortgage. You own your property, and have equity from it. It IS unfair to make him pay your mortgage if he has no stake in this property. It might be okay for a landlord to do this, but you are in a relationship and you have to decide whether or not you want to treat your partner like a partner or a tenant. If you go the tenant route, see the above paragraph on getting an official rental agreement.", "ESH.\n\nAssuming you aren't putting down a huge deposit, asking him to pay 50% is unfair.  Asking him to pay some rent, is very legit.  But not half of the mortgage.\n\nNow, here is the problem.  You agreed with him.  You need to STOP doing this.  This does not help anything:\n\n> I agreed at the time because I wanted the whole situation to calm down,\n\nYou've made an agreement for your living situation.  Now you want to reneg on it.  I'm not saying it's not appropriate, but ... yeah, he's going to be pissed off.  \n\nBut he absolutely should be paying something.\n\nBack to why you both suck?  Why didn't you have this conversation, before you bought a house?  If you were already living together - you are in theory, together, paying for that place somehow.  And you buying a place - means he's lost his room mate (if he doesn't automatically move in).  Why didn't you have this conversation?", "Possible ESH, info needed.  \n\nEverybody has to pay to live somewhere whether it\u2019s rent or mortgage.  Your boyfriend is a little naive to think that he won\u2019t have to contribute anything and you would just suck it all up. Unless half the mortgage is well below market rental rate I\u2019d say half is unfair (apply boyfriend discount!). \nThat said, $700/m feels very low\u2026\n\nUnless you\u2019re planning marrying this guy and living there forever, you need to be careful about him being seen to be paying \u2018his share\u2019 of the mortgage and then having rights to the house if you split (sounds like you\u2019re in the states, but I think this is the case in England).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
