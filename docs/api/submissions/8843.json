Nobody appreciate that people strange to you comes 'n goes in your house. Would you? Even if they are no harm, it's not comfy and as resting that you should feel when you're home.\n\nB. Your plan isn't necessarily as good for the dog that you might believe. First you're away from home, which is one thing that dog needs to deal with.

Safe and sound for so far. \nThen we come to the BUT here: in the dogs point of view, the good attentions you have to make sure she/he gets enough activities, isn't necessarily so good or calming. It can be even opposite of that. Dog sees that someone who doesn't live there comes every now and then without you beeing there. Even if that person is wonderfull and all, the situation is new and little unfair for the dog. Normal routines aren't staying anymore and You aren't there, so he must deal for his own. \nThere might not be a problem at this, but I've seeing lots of situations like this that it comes for suprise when dog's reaction isn't all happyhappy. Dog can get anxious,   can't relax and even react hostile. \n\nSo why not take the middle road here? If you're roommate can take care of the dog and (what other) pets, you should take that.

There\u2019s no lease that states you can\u2019t have a pet sitter.\n\nThere's no such thing as having guests when the host isn't at home, and a pet sitter isn't needed if roommate is still in the house while OP is away. \n\n>I would have been on your side if....  \n>  \n>I still say NTA\n\nThis also makes no sense.", "Still doesn't necessitate a social rotation. It's a dog.", "You need both roommates to approve of people who have open access to their home. Like it\u2019s basic common courtesy", "Sure, but if the roommate is willing and able to be the dog walker there's no reason for him to.", "This \"clarification\" doesn't change anything", "How convenient", "YTA and if I was your roommate, I would flat out not allow this. You don\u2019t get to invite strangers into your roommates living space when you\u2019re not there. How dare you.", "Your expectations are completely unacceptable. Board the dog, send it to someone else's house, or let your roommate do it as they've offered. Why on earth would you think it's reasonable to send random people into your *and your roommates'* home when you aren't even there?? YTA", "So what? It\u2019s simpler to not accept a favour. And sometimes, you just not want to have to be obligated to someone else if you can help it. I\u2019d much rather pay a service to come have my dog walked than accept a favour from a roommate unless I am really, really good friends with them. I don\u2019t want to be obligated to my roommate.", "You can legally have someone check on your pets if you don\u2019t trust your roommate to take care of your pet. I dog sit all the time. There\u2019s things on your lease that allows people to come and go. Even to have extra keys to come in and out while away. She can always review her lease. When I left town, my friends came to do the morning and evening walk because I didn\u2019t trust my roommate years ago. I\u2019m glad I did because whenever my friends came over to walk him, the water bowl was empty and she forgot to feed him. Obviously she wants her dog to be taken care of and it\u2019s her right. She pays her rent and is allowed to have someone check on her pet while she is away. If her roommate wants the place to herself then she needs to move out. I\u2019m sure she still expects that rent to be paid for those 2 weeks.", "I think it\u2019s reasonable to not want to accept a favour from someone even if they are willing to do it.", ">You can legally have someone check on your pets **if you don\u2019t trust your roommate to take care of your pet.**\n\nDoesn't apply here, because OP obviously trusts roommate to take care of the dog. \n\n>There\u2019s things on your lease that allows people to come and go. **Even to have extra keys to come in and out while away.**\n\nWth? That is such an invasion of privacy. I'm calling bull. Contractors and landlord maybe. Not random friends of OP. \n\n>If her roommate wants the place to herself then she needs to move out.\n\nRoommate wants the place to herself for the two weeks OP is away. That's not too much to ask. Don't be so dramatic. \n\n>I\u2019m sure she still expects that rent to be paid for those 2 weeks.\n\nWell duh, of course OP still has to pay the rent. They're not moving all their stuff out for two weeks are they?!", "Legally in my lease if I ask a friend to stop by. My leasing will hand her a key and allow her into the building. All I have to do is send an email. As I said, depends on where you live.\n\nObviously she doesn\u2019t trust them enough if they are having someone stop by 2x a day. \n\nIt\u2019s not invasion as long as she\u2019s stays on the roommates side. I have done this before with roommates. I set up a camera in my room and had her checking on my dog. Leasing gave her the spare key and allowed her to enter the apartment. \n\nI meant that since she pays rent she\u2019s allowed to have someone come check in on her dog. Wether her roommate likes it or not. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
