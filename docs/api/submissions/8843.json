Whilst it's wonderful that you want your dog to socialise with more than one person, it's not the onus of your housemate to accept random people who they do not know nor want at their home, to be dropping by daily so your dog can socialise with multiple people. You can make the time up with your dog when you return, or if you're that concerned about the impacts to your dog's development, then you can cancel the trip, stay home, and take the dog out of the house to socialise with multiple people.

Your reasons for having other people walk your dog while one of its owners is readily available to do so, is asinine. The dog will be just as happy being cared for by your roommate as it would be if Jack, Sally, Rita and Fred stopped by. Your dog isn't thinking, \"Oh.

You have a right to have guests, your dog doesn\u2019t.

Believe it or not, lots of people go away and only have one person taking care of their dog and the dog survives quite nicely. Sometimes people put their dogs in kennels run by unfamiliar people and it doesn\u2019t destroy their poor little canine psyche. Your dog will survive quite nicely for 2 weeks only seeing your roommate and not having the full and rich social life you envision.", "YTA. It\u2019s your roommate. You live together. There I\u2019m fairly certain your dog is familiar with them. So your reasoning is false. And since they\u2019re agreeable to take care of the dog while you\u2019re gone (which is awfully nice of them btw) there\u2019s no need for TWO additional to come by. It\u2019s their house to and you won\u2019t be there it would be very inconvenient for them to have random people popping up in the morning and evening. What is they want to hang around the house naked? What if they have something planned? In this plan of yours would you give the other people keys to the place or would you roommate have to be present to open the door? It\u2019s very disrespectful of you.

As an extremely introverted person, I can understand your roomie expecting/looking forward to having the space to themselves, and feeling a little jostled when those plans change. I know I've felt similarly about when I thought I was going to have my house to myself but other people wound up being around. I had to walk around with clothes all of a sudden!!\n\nOn the other hand, I get you wanting your dog to be socialized. Maybe your roommate could take him to the dog park or something?

But maybe you don't really see the full picture here as it is for your roommates or dog. Sounds more like you're trying to deal with your guiltiness for taking long vacation and leaving the dog behind.\n\nA. It's your roommate/mates home. Nobody appreciate that people strange to you comes 'n goes in your house. Would you? Even if they are no harm, it's not comfy and as resting that you should feel when you're home.\n\nB. Your plan isn't necessarily as good for the dog that you might believe. First you're away from home, which is one thing that dog needs to deal with. (And probably the one that is going just fine).\nThe dog is at home with familiar roommate that lives there. Safe and sound for so far. \nThen we come to the BUT here: in the dogs point of view, the good attentions you have to make sure she/he gets enough activities, isn't necessarily so good or calming. It can be even opposite of that. Dog sees that someone who doesn't live there comes every now and then without you beeing there. Even if that person is wonderfull and all, the situation is new and little unfair for the dog. Normal routines aren't staying anymore and You aren't there, so he must deal for his own. \nThere might not be a problem at this, but I've seeing lots of situations like this that it comes for suprise when dog's reaction isn't all happyhappy. Dog can get anxious,   can't relax and even react hostile. \n\nSo why not take the middle road here? If you're roommate can take care of the dog and (what other) pets, you should take that. There really isn't any point for friend to drive an hour(!) way multible times a day, or even every day. Maybe the friend of your's could come for those days that roommate is too busy and make sure the dog enough exercise (if there's such days). Your idea is lovely as a thought but in real life not practical, necessary or even the best for anyone involved.\n\nAt this point, have to vote YTA.
