NTA !\n\nThat was absolutely inappropriate and wildly asinine on Brendas part. I understand that she wants her kids to get along, but the time for insuring that they did was when you two were young, not when you are both grown ass adults!\n\nThe fact that Brenda did that when you had your new baby with you, essentially putting the baby in the middle of an extremely emotional and potentially volatile situation says alot about how little Brenda cares about the emotional well being of others.\n\nI would definitely send Brenda a letter (or email) explaining how that made you feel, and outlining that you will no longer be accepting contact from her unless she stops trying to 'fix' things. If she replies with an argument, you let her know she is now no longer welcome to contact you and you block her and you move on with your life.", "NTA. You were ambushed. You took it about like anybody would take it. It\u2019s interesting that Jane never said anything in your description, and makes me wonder if she knew. \n\nYou can always unblock people after you talk to your therapist, but it\u2019s not okay to just drop this stuff on people and your mother shouldn\u2019t have done it. I don\u2019t blame you for leaving.", "NTA. \n\nI feel your pain. I was forced into an intervention about my sister years ago. I wish I had been as bold as you to get up and leave. I had to deal with years of drama and manipulation due to not going NC. I am finally NC now and things are better for me. \n\nDo what you have to do to protect your peace and protect your family. \n\nYour sister showed what kind of person she is. She isn\u2019t going to change.", "NTA.  If you\u2019re a grown adult, you get to determine who you do and do not have a relationship with.  Your mom was banking on you not being willing to cause a scene.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother is way out of line. Interventions are not for damaged relationships. Interventions are for addicts or those who are otherwise destroying their own lives. But choosing to be no contact with Jane, as far as I can tell, is not harming you in the least.\n\nThis wasn't an intervention. It was your mother trying to impose her will on you and attempting to force a reconciliation.\n\nThat aside, suppose you decided to go along with it. Given what you've shared about Jane's character, I'm sure she would do her level best to make everything seem like it was all your fault. You wouldn't have been heard and you would have been blamed for everything.\n\nHow do I know this? Because Jane was already present and apparently decided to go along with this. She was sitting in the room, apparently wise to what was going on. If I were a gambling man, I'd bet money she's got her little spiel planned.\n\nEven if this were an intervention to get you and Jane to repair your relationship, why are ***you*** the only one being ambushed? Shouldn't both you and Jane be caught off guard, instead of just you?\n\nEveryone involved in this \"intervention\" has already framed you as the bad guy, the one who needs to be to fixed.\n\nProps to your stepdad. Sounds like he knew this was a bad idea going in.", "NTA You walked into an ambush not an \"intervention\". Your mother is a special type of doddle bug if she thought a grown ass adult was going to sit thru a forced reconciliation with a shifty character just because you share DNA.", "NTA \n\nWould you treat anyone like they treated you? If not, why would it be ok for them to treat you this way?\n\nYou have value as a unique human being and also as a spouse and a parent. You have to allow yourself to do what is right for you or you won\u2019t be able to do whatever is right for all of your family. \n\n\nYou have been NC with your sister since 2018. It took years to reach that point and years of being that way. Why shouldn\u2019t it take time for healing too? \n\nFor them to demand that you do what they want when and how they wanted is incredibly disrespectful to you. For them to berate you for not allowing them to disrespect your boundaries is ridiculous. IF you choose to try to work things out with Jane, being surrounded by her verbal hit-men probably isn\u2019t ideal. Perhaps a neutral family mediator with just the two of you might be productive if and when you decide to do that.\n\nAmbushing someone rarely ends well. I repeat NTA", "NTA -\n\nYou expected grandma time for your child and are met by the *Family Inquisition* expecting to force-fix your relationship with your sister via this intervention. And she's sitting there expecting it to work so she can keep gaslighting you.\n\nIf your sister were REALLY wanting to reconnect, she would do it 1-to-1 and start with an apology for the shenanigans about the estate.", "An intervention is to \"intervene\" in someone's risky behaviors, usually drugs or alcohol. Not to interfere in someone's personal relationships or lack thereof. This is more of a \"busy-body-ention\".

I wouldn't talk to any of them again unless it's absolutely necessary.", "NTA it's been 20+ years since I cut ties with my brother. I'd have done the same if I'd been put in this position ......sad thing is you were taking baby to see your mum and she ruined that moment. She's not respectful in the least here.\n\nYour feelings need to be validated whether or not they agree with it, you chose not to have a relationship with your sister. They need to accept that. I'm sorry your trip was ruined op.", "NTA go home and stay off family social media and block all their numbers.  Keep yourself busy until Friday which won't be hard with a baby. The silence will drive them nuts which is an added benefit.", "NTA. Just because you're blood related, it doesn't mean they have a right to treat you however they want to without consequences. You have boundaries and stick to them. If they really cared about you, they wouldn't do those things to you and just expect you to accept it.", "NTA. What, you didn't want to stick around to be lectured at about how your feelings are wrong, after they lied to you?

Weird how \"being the bigger person\" NEVER includes quietly  removing yourself from everyone else's bullshit", "Holy cow! I'm with you on NC with poisonous sisters, I'm hoping the next time I have anything to do with my former sister is driving past her funeral (I won't bother attending, I just want to be sure she's actually died. Hasn't happened yet, but I can wait.)\n\nWho do these people think they are?! Well done on the shiny spine and getting out of there, you absolutely did the right thing, don't question yourself for a millisecond. I'm very impressed that you didn't blow up completely. \n\nNTA", "This goes beyond an \"intervention\". Your Mom not only invalidated your feelings (totally justified BTW) around having a relationship with your sister, she essentially decided that your sister's criminal actions against you are acceptable to her and you are expected to forget it.  She disrespected you, your wife, your baby, wasted your time, money with no remorse, but made it clear that she put your sister above not only you, but her own grandchild.  That's scorched earth actions right there.", "NTA I\u2019m glad they wasted money trying to set that up though.", "NTA.\n\nYour family seems... so... fun. /s", "NTA! \nGo NC and live a better life. Ask your mum to shove it before you block her.", "NTA. Mom needs to respect your boundaries and stop trying to force a relationship with Jane. You did the right thing by leaving, don't let them guilt trip you into feeling bad about it. Stay strong and focus on your own family now.", "NTA. I'm NC with my sister and have told my mother numerous times that I am not interested in contact with her, I do not want her telling my sister my business (even telling her this one specific fact must never be shared with her *and she did it anyway*), I do not want to be involved with her in any way. It's downright disrespectful to try to force *you* to deal with this toxic person in your life for *her* feelings. If Jane wanted to apologize or try to make amends, she can do it privately, not by manipulating you into a position you do not want to be in by making a spectacle of it. That's not okay at all, and I would have done the same in your position. I just had it out with my mother for sharing the details I specifically asked her not to share and I'm still pissed about it. Live your life how you need to live it. If they want you in theirs, they need to respect your choices and your limits.", "NTA\n\nNo apology from your mum? NC!", "NTA and the fact that your family is harassing you and bombarding you with texts is proof enough that you've been right all along.\n\nYour step-dad sounds like the only semi-decent one of the group.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu handled this bullshit well.", "NTA. You were totally ambushed! This is some next level manipulation on Brenda\u2019s part. I\u2019d definitely be considering going low or no contact with her.

At all.\n\nI\u2019m sorry they\u2019re not respecting you.", "Wow NTA.  Your mother took a special moment of bonding with her grandchild and turned it into crap,  she has no say in your relationship with your sister.  Has your sister ever apologized or owned her behavior?  I\u2019m sure your sister is perfectly fine with having everything swept under as they blame you for your behavior.

Good on you for going NC with these people, you;re better off without the bunch of them.", "Nta. Having grown up in that toxic mess had to give you some coping skills.\n\n Sounds like your wife is a-fucking-mazing for being there and being on your side. \n\nIt's really hard to walk into a really messed up situation and see in stark, brutal relief how messed up everyone around you was. Feel your feelings, but celebrate your growth too. Leaving and standing by your boundary is a big moment for you. Congratulations.", "Stop doubting, NTA. You've done a healthy thing in going NC with the sister  now say bye to the rest of the assholes.", "NTA! \n\nToxic is fucking toxic! Doesn't matter if it is siblings, parents, coworkers, job, etc.. Boundaries were in place. Your mother crossed them, repeatedly, with no concern for your feelings, whatsoever. She can now go pound sand. Let her know, that her golden child daughter can have everything when she kicks the bucket, and that both of them are now dead to you. I sure in tf would.. in fact, I did. I am no contact with my entire family, and I am the oldest of 7 children. I mourned the loss of my mother in 2006. She died in 2019. I didn't know most of my siblings, but the couple that I was in contact, I cut contact off completely in 2021.

At least I hope not. If she did, however, I can only hope I would be as composed as you were. You handled it perfectly.   \n\n\nI find it endlessly fascinating (infuriating) that the sane member of the family is always the one pressured to \u201cget over it\u201d while the lying, hurtful, gaslighting member never seems to be encouraged to apologize, make amends or get therapy.   \n\n\nYOU ARE NOT THE ASSHOLE. \n\nYour mother has, at the very least, earned a timeout.

Your boundary is that you do not want to have a relationship with Jane. Your mother tried to force the issue, including springing Jane's presence on you, so you removed yourself to enforce your boundary. Your mother does not get to spend time with you or her grandchild if she cannot respect the boundary you have put up around not having contact with Jane.", "Your sister tried to rob and defraud you.\n\nThem coming together as a group to bully you into pretending to forget you were wronged is nonsense.\n\nIf they want to fix something, it should be your sister's criminal tendencies. Nothing wrong about walking out from nonsense. NTA", ">not actually being physically there when he died in hospice\n\nAs a former hospice worker, it's not reasonable to blame someone for this. It's not reasonable to assume someone can be by a patient's side 24/7, and dying doesn't happen on a schedule. Sometimes people go quickly enough that their family can't get there in time.", "NTA", "Wow NTA this sounds like a nightmare scenario, can\u2019t believe that happened and other people actually joined in!", "NTA, tell you mom to give it all to Jane as whatever she has is not worth being around any of her family.", "NTA. This was exactly the reason I didn't visit my brother when he was dying, his ex was controlling everything including phone access. She lives in a state that allows conversion therapy, and I was frankly afraid of being kidnapped for the sake of Christ the lord. His kids couldn't assure me she didn't have any ulterior motives either. \n\nThis is the same person who physically damaged a house I was getting ready to sell after her and her family literally destroyed it (left 2' of trash throughout including dog, cat, and human feces throughout the house). I had bought the house for them to live in because their SNAP benefits were cut (lied about that too). All they needed to do was keep up with the utilities, and their alcohol addiction made that impossible.", ">My Mom went into this tirade of how I'm a grown adult and this behavior is childish. I need to make up with my sister so we can put all of this behind us.\n\nThe irony here is that an adult has the right to determine their relationships, but your mother is trying to control you like a child and force you to reconcile with your gross ass sister. She's infantilizing you whilst violating actions you took as a mature adult.\n\nYou aren't the asshole for choosing not to be brow beat into reconciling with a sister who manipulated to and lied to you. You have every right to hold her at arms length, and if she can't make amends **on her own** than why does she deserve your forgiveness just because a bunch nosy old people say so.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

I didnt talk to them for nearly 2 years and am thankful every day that I got back in contact when I did and that they got to spend school holidays with my son as less than 6months later he passed away in an accident. My mother has said a few times how she is so thankful that we\u2019d started speaking again before that happened as she got that little bit of time with him at least and how it would have crushed her even worse had this not happened and honestly I felt so much guilt for the time I robbed them of with their grandson that they will never be able to get back now. \nLooking back it wasn\u2019t something I should have gone NC over, it was stuff that yes, probably should have been addressed and wasn\u2019t right, but I had been fine with the way our relationship was until I let someone else dictate their own feelings on the matter and try to push that as the only acceptable/logical way of viewing the whole thing. \nAgain, my case is different from your own and I understand that. But I just wanted to let you know, from someone who has regret they can\u2019t take back over going NC, to make sure you think very clearly on this and if at all you think you would feel the same to at least consider the option of therapy with them. \nIf you give them that option and they won\u2019t take it or try to suggest that you should have to pay for it, well then you know that they don\u2019t really care about resolving the issue for the right reasons, but just want it cause they don\u2019t want to have to DEAL with the issue and it would make THEM feel better for it to go away, regardless of your feelings. \n\nGood luck.", "There\u2019s lots of comments here already but it reminded me of a comment my mother made a few years back.

Whatever, I don\u2019t even like you so I won\u2019t lose sleep. He tells me all this a month before the wedding. Then the day before he asks me what he should wear. \u2026. I sent him a link to the wedding website (that he RSVPd on) and told him he can talk to mom because it\u2019s the day before and I have shit to do. He decided to tell me that there were no reasons anyone should care about our wedding and so I told him fine, don\u2019t come.  During the rehearsal dinner my mom asked if I was sure. Yes. During travel to hair and make up she asked me if I was sure. Yes. I\u2019m in my freaking dress, doing touch ups after pictures and she tells me that they\u2019ve managed to make it on time, are dressed and ready at the place where our transportation was picking people up and was I sure they couldn\u2019t come. Did I stutter once? No, they cannot. Their table has been removed from the reception.  I was thiiiiissss close to telling her if she asked me again, she could leave and spend the day with them.\n\nCut to a few months later and their absence at the wedding came up over the dinner table and she tells me that I got upset with him for no reason, he was just making sure he knew what to wear for \u201cmy pictures\u201d (psh, like I\u2019d have displayed any with him in it anyways \ud83d\ude02), and that I was wrong. So I asked her simply \u201cif what you say is true, why did he tell me there were no reasons to care about the wedding?\u201d She looked a little surprised (hmm I guess he didn\u2019t tell her he said that??) and said \u201cwell I don\u2019t know.\u201d I said \u201cyeah. But I was the one in the wrong. He knew a day ahead to not waste his time driving here. He knew they weren\u2019t invited anymore.
