Is this a common thing for your mom to put herself into these situations? \n\nMaybe that's weighing on her.", "INFO: How did she make things \"about herself?\" Does your mom do things like this often? Does your sister normally have a short temper?", "I'm going to go with NTA, since you were trying to defend your mom. Could you have also stayed calm and not cussed/name called? Probably. But your mom was already upset, and having her daughter yelling about how she made a mistake wasn't going to help. However Im willing to bet your sister is probably just scared of something happening to your mom because she loves her. Sounds like everyone is at least a little stressed. Maybe you could all sit down for a family meal and just enjoy eachother company? It's stressful helping anyone heal from major surgery- my mom just had her hip replaced. It's important to sometimes just take a step back and remember you're all on the same side here. Your moms side. I hope she has a speedy and good recovery, especially after her fall.", "NTA.  But here\u2019s the best advice I\u2019ve ever gotten.  We can\u2019t control how others act but we can control how we react.  Don\u2019t rise to the bait next time.", "NTA.   Your sister is TA.   Even if your mother had been exercising incorrectly, that\u2019s an appalling way to behave.   Screaming at a person like that is not okay.\n\nIf your mother was doing the kind of exercise her doctor had prescribed and happened to slip on ice or something, then your sister is *very* out of line.   Your mother *must* gently exercise her new knee if she wants to be able to use it.   That\u2019s the whole point of physio.   It\u2019s the hardest part of a knee replacement.", "Quick question: is your older sister your mother\u2019s major carer in this family?", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is the AH and she needs therapy!", "NTA - your sister's reaction to this incident is pure bonkers. Blaming someone for having an accident just is not on. Doing exercises after knee surgery is incredibly important else it will soon get stiff and may end up worse than it was pre-surgery, maybe your mum was rejoicing in having increased mobility and pushed herself too far too soon, but that's no reason to kick off at her this way.\n\nGranted snapping back at your sister possibly wasn't the best way to handle it, but unfortunately with some people you have to be abrupt and direct to actually derail their self-absorbed rant because anything less just won't cut through their thought processes and it seems like she was just scooping more stress on the situation with a bucket loader.", "ESH\n\nYour sister did not handle this situation in the best way however, it\u2019s not uncommon for people to get upset & angry when they have no control & can\u2019t help someone who is hurt or injured. Showing fear or concern through anger is not helpful but it\u2019s pretty normal.\n\nYou didn\u2019t need to escalate the situation. She was talking to your brothers not your Mom.\n\ncorrection spelling", "Was this happening downstairs where your mom could\u2019ve, (or did), hear what your sister was saying downstairs?\n\nWas your mom being encouraged to, (or at least told she\u2019d be fine to this soon after surgery), do these exercises? \n\nWas your mom alone when she fell?\n\nI don\u2019t know what horrible stuff your sister was shouting to your brothers, but I can see both perspectives here.\n\nWithout some context it\u2019s hard to say how warranted it was for your sister to be livid. Although it\u2019s not her knee, she obviously knows how much pain your mom is and how difficult this process has been. If your mom by chance shouldn\u2019t of been exercising, I can see her being upset that your mom went against her recovery and ended up injuring herself. If she was encouraged to workout but possibly shouldn\u2019t of been doing workouts outside or alone, I *again* could see your sister being livid that she exercised in an unsafe manner, potentially contributing to injury. If your mom just wants to recover, and your sister also just wants her to recover - she may just be stressed / upset that your mom potentially pushed her recovery further back.\n\nHowever, to your point, accidents happen. Mistakes happen. Making poor decisions happen. Even if your mom shouldn\u2019t of exercised, there\u2019s tons of people who go against doctors wishes because they either feel like they physically can or are tired of feeling physically incapable and want to push themselves a little to recover faster. If she was encouraged, she may of not wanted to burden anyone and just wanted to get outside and exercise. Either way, you can\u2019t reverse time to your mom falling. There\u2019s no point in kicking her while she\u2019s already down! Just need to be there for her and come up with a better plan to avoid another incident in the future.\n\nIf your sister couldn\u2019t calm down, let it go, and was causing fights, I\u2019d eventually tell her to shut the fuck up too. \n\nOP - NTA!", "NTA. I have a new knee and it changed my world. Anyone shaming someone for getting the medical help they need to live without pain and recover their mobility is a BFAH", "ESH\n\nYour sister was well out of line, but you weren't exactly helping the situation.", "ESH but you more. How is she making things about her selfish? I don\u2019t think you know what that word means.", "NTA.\n\nIt seems like your sister blew up for no reason.

She thought she could do it herself as she has the equipment there and ended up cracking her cast, thankfully not her knee! Sometimes they get frustrated with things they can no longer do and feel like they CAN do it themselves. I\u2019m sure it scared the Mother and she felt horrible that she had not only put herself in danger but scared the kids too. Was no need to yell at her! It\u2019s a time to tell her she has support and convince her to call when she needs help! NTA for trying to pull your sister back. Sometimes you just need to yell a few cur words to snap someone out of it", "Yeah, I\u2019ve currently been in that position of main cater post TKR as well as work, housework etc and the mental load is draining. Depending on the patient, she may be having to fetch and carry, help mum wash, cook meals, encourage them to do physio on top of the regular routine. I\u2019ve not behaved like this but I\u2019ve had a mini mental breakdown several weeks in due to exhaustion- no shouting but lots of tears. Plus we don\u2019t know how long mum has needed extra help- during my mum\u2019s recovery in hospital, they thought she might have an infection, and the thought of all the suffering I\u2019d already been through and looking down the barrel of a totally destroyed knee due to infection (or a bad fall in OPs mum\u2019s case) was enough to take me to the edge of the abyss of being a permanent carer.", "Tell me one situaiton where screaming at others ( brothers and sis ) who have nothing to do with it and making the house a warzone is ever justified ? \n\nWhen does YELLING ever solved a situation ? \n\nEven if the sis angry that the mom did what she wasn't suppose to do . Yelling like a maniac doesn't heal her mom . Fighting with everybody doesn't make anything better.", "But that\u2019s not what sister was doing- she was shouting at her for potentially wrecking her new knee by doing something daft and falling.

She\u2019s in pain and she just made her knee even worse than ever!\u201d *insert probably worse language / things said based off OP\u2019s accounts.* My assumption was she was upset and basically projecting to anyone who was within earshot, thus entering into arguments with people who probably were like OP trying to have reason. \n\n\nHowever.. to clarify\u2026nowhere in my reply did I justify yelling / screaming. Half of my response was basically reiterating the last paragraph of your comment. \ud83d\ude05", "ESH. I get that your sister may have anger issues and she shouldnt have done what she did (its not a healthy coping mechanism).\n\nBut I get where she is coming from. She is frustrated and propably very desperate - it hurts seeing someone you love suffer, especially if they could have easily avoided that.\n\nYour way of handling her anger wasnt any better. Especially calling her \"a selfish bitch\". I dont think her actions have to be selfish, it could just be out of desperation. All you did was to make everything worse. Nobody calms down after being insulted like that.", "Info: did your Mom just dump a whole lot more work on your sister?", "More to this than mom fell after surgery at home. Sounds like built up anger this lit the fuse.", "NTA. Your sisters reaction was obnoxious. But this one\u2019s tough for me. When my mom was going through chemo core her breast cancer she refused to rest. Like, still going to work every day and being there for 11 hours and cleaning the house etc etc. and not because no one else would do it, btw. My brother and my father both lived there and tried to do things for her but she wouldn\u2019t let them do things she felt she should be able to do. And I get that, it\u2019s hard to feel fragile and weak. But it was sincerely affecting her health and that was frustrating to watch. She\u2019d call me sometimes in tears about being so tired and feeling so weak and when I would ask her what she did that day she would tell me all the things she\u2019d done and it was all I could do to not scream at her and tell her to lie down and fucking rest because I felt like if she kept doing all the things, she would stress herself into deadness. Like Christ mom, you have cancer! It\u2019s ok for you to not do everything. I dunno. I empathize with your sister, but in the end she flew off the handle and you calling her out for her behavior doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.", "Exactly! My mom had hip replacement last year, and i can't tell you the number of times she would tell me she was wore because she did something she shouldn't have. Oh I hurt because while you were at work I went out to to woodshed to bring in wood for the spare woodpile. I used may walker to carry the wood but it's not good going through snow. Meanwhile, the indoor wood pile is full, with enough for at least one day. The spare pile is on the porch so if we were both sick we'd have another couple days without having to go out to the woodshed, and dudnt need refilling. No need to go but stubbornness. I lost my mind more than once. If she pulls the same trucks after her knee replacement on two weeks i swear we will have a come to Jesus moment.", "No, she was complaining to her brothers, not Mom, about Mom's stupidity", "I'm wondering if the brothers were supposed to be watching or helping Mom exercise."]}
