I\u2019ve taken care of dogs that have had me pretty uncomfortable but that unfortunately is just apart of the job. \n\nToday I was taking two large sized kiddos out for a walk and everything was going great, they pulled a little but most dogs do being in a 4x16 kennel all day. \n\nThese dogs didn\u2019t have any behavioral issues as far as I knew and as we turned around we met a coworker of mine taking out two other large dogs. One of them started barking, I went to the other side of our dirt road path as to not cause conflict. The kiddos  unfortunately decided otherwise and I am a small person but I normally can deal with pulling or reactive dogs well. Not these dogs though, they pulled so hard that I fell down onto my back and ended up being dragged through a dirt and gravel parking lot while my other coworker tried to keep these dogs from attacking each other. Finally after about a minute or two of this my coworker stopped them and I could get up. \n\nI put the dogs up and went to the bathroom to inevitably cry and clean up a bit. The \u201cinjuries\u201d were minimal. A scratched up knee, a ruined outfit, bruised back, and of course my hands were pretty messed up. Afterwards I went to tell my manager and he said since nothing was that bad I should go back to work while he filled out the info on their report cards and got a dr to make sure the four dogs involved were okay so I did.\n \nHere\u2019s where I might be the asshole: I got back in time for \u201cplay time\u201d where we all get groups of dogs to watch in one of the play yards and my group had those two dogs. I told them I wasn\u2019t going to take out the dogs. While the incident happened when they were leashed I didn\u2019t feel very good about having them in my group. I got into an argument with my coworker about it and eventually she traded our groups. I ended up having to speak to the supervisor about everything and she got onto me telling me to get over the altercation because it\u2019s just how it goes and we\u2019re to short staffed to have people afraid of dogs. but that was a pretty big incident especially after only working there for a few months.\n\nalso just to clarify we don\u2019t walk dogs in twos unless they are being boarded together so I had a pair of siblings and coworker had siblings too.", "created_utc": 1667537562, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylp84k/aita_after_refusing_to_walk_a_dog_after_being/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your supervisor should be reported, because it seems like you weren't even told to get checked out for your cuts or bruises. Very little empathy going on here.", "NTA  \nYour supervisor was literally more concerned about the dog's condition than yours.  \nYou need to have boundaries and protect yourself. It doesn't matter how short staffed they are, that is not your concern.", "Did file an incident report for your injuries?! You need to make sure a report is filed ASAP! If any of your injuries become infected or you have unexpected permanent damage it needs to be documented or you are stuck with ALL these medical bills.\nDon't let any employer, supervisor or manager just push you back to work without making sure your injuries are documented and an incident report is filled out.\n\nNTA! But your bosses and company is.", "They're about to get a hell of a lot more short staffed. Tell them you won't take that pair out again together, file a workmen's comp claim if you need massage or chiropractic and don't let them pressure you into taking dogs you aren't comfortable with. I'd also start looking for a better kinder practice- they're all hiring. NTA", "Not the asshole, you should be entitled to workers compensation for your injuries if you e in the United States. You should file a report as soon as you can with a description of your injuries and go to the doctor to get everything documented. You are entitled to get paid while staying home!", "NTA in the short term, they should allow you time to recover from the incident, it\u2019s fair and reasonable you don\u2019t want to risk being injured again while you are already hurt. \n\nBut really as an employer they should be thinking about who is a good fit to care for which animals, 1) because of the best interests of the animal, you want to be able to keep an animal under control when being exercised for their own safety 2) because if the employee continues getting injured they will have time off work or may even leave and get another job. So really them being already short staffed should be motivation to accommodate you rather than the other way round. \n\nAfter your recovery they need to train you with appropriate strategies etc on how to deal with these situations and help you to build your confidence back up, if they are good employers.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
