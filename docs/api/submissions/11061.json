This is pretty common for older people. The phone is already logged in to Netflix, he doesn't have to do anything to make it work. \n\nMaybe he needs help getting other apps installed on his phone. Or maybe he was in the middle of watching a series. It's understandable for him to be irritated if he's out on a job and can't watch the TV he planned to fall asleep to.\n\nI'm going with NAH (no @$$ here) because you're trying to cut out some reoccurring fees and he's just trying to watch his shows after working. \n\nThe real solution here is to help your dad get set up to be entertained on the road. And if all else fails get him Netflix gift cards for father's day and set up his account on his phone for him.", "Info were you pushing cancelling the Netflix after they said they didn't want to? I don't really get why it came up.", "NTA, I understand how frustrating it can be to fall back into the same old toxic pattern with your parents.\n\nTo prevent future guilt trips, you need to untangle yourself from them financially. They want Netflix and you don't - great! Change the email on the account to theirs or your brother's. If their names are on any account you use, get your own separate account - car insurance, the car title itself, bank accounts, medical insurance. You're an adult and they don't need to be all up in your business.\n\nMaybe it's not possible in the short term, but make it a goal over the next year to separate yourself from their oversight. Make it so that they can't come to you and order you to continue Netflix - that's just not your business, you have no control over it, they'll have to figure it out themselves.", "NTA, but what do you mean your dad is a truck driver and watches Netflix on the road ? This sounds pretty dangerous. It\u2019s definitely better to cut off Netflix then. You\u2019re making the right call either way.", "It\u2019s mine, I pay for it.", "They don\u2019t have any shame announcing that it\u2019s exactly what they have planned. It\u2019s been brought up a few times as to \u201cwho\u2019s taking care of who\u201d and guess what- I\u2019m the oldest. I\u2019ve argued that it\u2019s definitely not happening that way.", "He\u2019s pretty phone-savvy. He\u2019s all on TikTok lol. The gift card thing is a good idea. I think I\u2019ll look into that.", "hmmm no, it seems like the family is being extremely rude to her, why should she help? They kicked her out.", "When the whole Netflix password sharing issue came up a few weeks ago, we talked about it at dinner and they agreed. Then they brought it up again last night. I\u2019m not sure why they did though, we weren\u2019t even talking about Netflix at first.", "Thank you. Yes, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing over the past year. I\u2019m independent from them besides car insurance- everything else is under my name. It just goes back to me wanting to be respectful of my parents, but now I\u2019m seeing they don\u2019t respect me.", "He watches Netflix when he\u2019s done with his shift/resting.", "Yeah, I edited my comment after I read it was yours and you canceled it. Hell with them. They're not entitled to your stuff unless you feel like sharing.", "My parents already made different arrangements because not me or my sister want an unpaid career in elderly care. I also moved as far as I could, to make a point.", "I bet they aren't mad over the actual $20. It's that they don't want to go through all the steps to set up their own account and log in on all devices. It is a pain in the butt. You can soften the experience for them by making the account for them. I don't think this has to be a big issue.", "But why do you care what subscription service they have?", "This is a question about what respect looks like. Are you required to follow everything your elders say without question? I mean, even soldiers are allowed to say, \"I'm not going to follow that order.\"\n\nI would argue that it's a lot kinder for you to show your parents how they can earn/keep your respect. Make it easy for them to stop guilt-tripping you ... by not leaving them opportunities to guilt-trip you.\n\nYou parents think there are two options: 1) you obey them or 2) they pressure you until you do option 1.\n\nIn fact, YOU know that the two options are: 1) they respect you and your choices, or 2) they GTFO out of your life. It's very kind to make it easier for them to remain in your life, right?\n\n(edit: Good job being financially independent! Just to be clear, I also meant that you should stop sharing all streaming services and any other subscriptions/accounts with your parents; if they can make demands about how you spend your money, that's a way to guilt-trip you!)", "I did offer this as a solution before the argument got bad, but they refuse to pay for it on their own.", "I\u2019m paying for it. It\u2019s my account. I just share it with them.", "Sounds like you're offering a good solution already. I re read your post, you were discussing it with them before you made the change and being very fair about the whole thing. That's all someone getting a free ride can ask for.\n\nSharing accounts should be a simple thing. Some people make it stressful \ud83d\ude2c", "Ah, so it's a control issue. I hope you have had very clear and frank conversations about who will (not) be caring for them in the future. Leave them no wiggle room bc they seem like the type to just show up on your porch with their shit and say \"well now you HAVE to take care of us!\"", "Ohhhh. Okay NTA", "Do you have access to other streaming services that your parents pay for?", "No. They don\u2019t pay for any services. My brother and I split the costs.", "NTA - give your dad the account. Downgrade it to the version that includes ads, and move on!   \nyou and I have the same dad!", "NTA well since they don't have to support you living with them rent free they have the free income to pay their own Netflix account. Win!", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey can get their own netflix.", "NTAA. There's 100% some cultural components at play here (not that I agree with those, but they are there and not everyone is going to relate) but that's not your problem", "OK, so it is *YOUR* Netflix account. Your dad (who doesn't live with you) likes to use it on his phone. Given that the new \"password sharing rule\" requires mobile devices on your account to \"authenticate\" by logging into *YOUR* home WiFi every month, I don't see what difference it makes if you pay or not... He won't be able to connect.", "NTA. Jut cancel the Netflix. When they complain tell the \"I wasn't asking your opinion, just wanted to let you know that I did cancel it and it will end at the end of the month.", "I love how parents say you didn't pay for this or that, or all the things I did for you growing up....guess what?  That's what parenting is, you do for your kids as much as you can to make sure they are going to make it in this life.  When your berating & blaming your children all you're doing is hurting them & making it harder for them to get on in life.  You don't OWE your parents a thing.  Don't let them guilt you into believing you do.", "not that i disagree about them being the AH in this case, but cmon, she was \u201cthrown out\u201d at 25yo. Not paying for anything until you\u2019re 25yo is a huge help to start your life.", "They kicked OP out last year. She is 26 years old. She lived rent free during the years from 18 to 25.", "Exactly, they don\u2019t get that?? It\u2019s frustrating", "Wouldn\u2019t the password sharing policy do the dirty work of kicking them off for you?", "So they keep upsetting you over and over again when you're their retirement plan. I wonder how that will work out for them.\n\nWhat really hurts? Do you miss them or does it hurt because your parents aren't what you need or want them to be?", "Yeah. Kicking you out at 18 does not equal you caretaking for them. NTA.", "OP info needed. Do your parents pay your car insurance?", "I pay my own car insurance. I Zelle them the full amount every month.", "Get your own, you need to break free!", "Drop the rope!!", "NTA \n\nI was raised to be respectful of my elders too, but to my parents, that meant having good manners rather than being a door mat. Apparently, your parents belong more to the latter group unfortunately. I've seen a really good meme about this and wish I had to saved to post the words. \n\nYou did nothing wrong and it is OK to stand up for yourself. If your dad wants Netflix he can pay for his own account.", "NTA no one owes their parents anything for raising them", "NTA. Absolutely not. But as someone who can relate. It's about you doing something nice for them. Something selfless. That's how, I think, they see it. For my mom this is what she sees as love and respect. I disagree with it.  But, I have learned to choose my battles. A therapist gave me some of the best advice for dealing with family. 'You do what the least damaging thing is to you.' The thing that is easier to live with. My mom is 86. I choose my battles carefully and honestly now they are few and far between. So the question is, do you cancel YOUR account and fight with them and not talk? Or do you bite the 20 and basically make that a gift for your father? Only you know which will be more soothing to you and your peace of mind. Which do i have a higher chance of wishing I had done differently, is generally how I think about it.", "I'm latino so believe me when is ay they don't care about you... So why do you care about them? It doesn't matter if that hurt.. You need to go NC with them or you can suffer the rest of your life. Your call.  NTA.", "Cancel it, they can buy their own", "It said she was thrown out twice.", "Taking care of your children is not living rent free. Not in every culture there's the urge to leave as soon as you turn 18.", "yeah, my point is that, at 25yo, you\u2019re old enough to be living by yourself. It\u2019s normal adulthood, you can\u2019t live with your parents while being an adult, not paying for anything and still want to live by your own rules in their house.\nFind a roommate and go live by yourself, it\u2019s what most of us do.", "NTA\nIf it actually is that important they can spend their own money on it.", "NTA. Good God, I hate when parents say, \"all that I did for my *minor* child.\" It's their choice to bring in a child into the world, it is their *responsibility* to give that child the best life possible. Don't throw it into the child's face or act like the child owes the parent a damn thing.", "If youve moved out and dont want to be bothered then cancel it and count your bleszings", "Oh yikes, yeah this is grounds for disowning your parents completely.  I can understand going NC is hard and hurts because they are family, but yeah no.  This is not how people that love you behave.  It will suck, but I recommend ditching this circus now and don\u2019t give in.", "Don't argue. Just tell. You are NTA. You are an adult now. Set boundaries and enforce them and never argue. Just state your position and if they object, shrug and walk away.", "Honestly, a lot of younger people are struggling to make it on their own with the way the world is going and a huge amount of people are staying home for longer to save the money to be able to live on their own or even with roommates as opposed to family. This has been the case for quite a while and I don\u2019t see the point in shaming people for not being able to afford to make it on their own. \nIt\u2019s one thing to say someone should be able to just move out and another being able to actually do it.. \nLike.. my father was able to job hop from PE teacher to fisherman to archaeologist. Back then. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d be able to do it now and there would be no point telling me I could, because I can\u2019t. \nMeh. Plus they are actually not in fact living with their parents and have in fact already moved out. They were 25 when they got kicked out. They are now 26 and do not in fact live with these assholes. They pay for themselves, live by themselves and have their own rules. So. Yeah. There\u2019s that. Daddy dearest just wants access to their account because sperm I guess", "NTA but now you know what to give your dad for his birthday and Christmas.  Six month gift card for Netflix (or maybe 2 or 3 months).  (Assuming you give them gifts)\n\nI do that all the time with my ex-brother in law (I get along with him we are still friends).  He wants to watch all kinds of shows on streaming platforms but does not want to pay.  So I get him a three month gift card for whatever platform he talks about lately.  He binges the shows he wants to watch and then cancels it when the card runs out.", "NTA Kick them off any other subscriptions while your at it. Sounds like you shouldn't bother trying to have a relationship with them.", "NTA", "NTA but this is advice I feel you should take from other immigrant parent-having children, or first gen kids, because this whole \"stick up for yourself against your whole family\" isn't something we do and leave unscathed from. Community is IMPORTANT, and family is GOD. \"Parents sacrificed their personal wellbeing and even happiness to raise you in a better place than they were raised in\" type of deal. What parents fail to realize that they stop us from having the \"better life\" they talked about when they perpetuate conservative views on family structure like this.\n\nMaybe you can help create a new account for your parents and use their card to start the account? They might be too proud to say they don't know how to make an account.", "NTA. They can afford their own subscription!", "NTA but for real you need to go no contact. Least for a few years. Let them learn that behaviors have consiquences.", "NTA. It may hurt but the abuse is appalling and id never talk to them again. They are not worth the mental struggle.", "But she said she doesn't even watch Netflix anymore so it's just for their benefit. Might as well save the money."]}
