{"id": 7426, "submission_id": "10cr1c8", "title": "AITA for leaving my family on Christmas after they gave me a Switch?", "selftext": "So I (26M) try to go to my parents' house on holidays, even though we have a strained relationship as some background, just years of abandonment issues and feeling discarded as some context.\n\nSo at the start of this last December, my Switch got stolen (this is important to the story), it had literal thousands of hours logged on Pokemon games along with many rare Pokemon called shinys. I had been super hyped up for competitive play to start back up and had been grinding hard for it so I was super devasted when it got stolen, to the point where I contemplated giving up competing in games entirely. I'm still not fully over how all my hardwork was snatched away from me.\n\nSo snap forward to Christmas Eve and I'm working a double (I'm a GM at a small store and never want my employees to feel forced to work holidays) and I get off exhausted. My mother forgot that she was supposed to give me a ride and sent my brother instead, we get to their house and they're wrapping presents. They hardly acknowledge I'm there, so I just took a nap, when my brother gets back he wakes me up and we celebrate in the way anyone in their mid-20s would and pass out. So my little sister (8) wakes us up excited to open presents and obviously my brother and I are a little groggy after drinking so much. \nWell my sister hands my brother a present and its a box of chocolate and then hands me one and its a PS controller (note I don't own any consoles), and my mother says, \"OH A PLAYSTATION CONTROLLER FOR THE FAMILY!\" and I kinda just blow it off. Next my brother gets a blanket and my little sister hands me a box and I open it and it's a Switch, and my mom says, \"OH A SWITCH FOR THE FAMILY!!!\" (which I knew they had gotten themselves ahead of time, I just didn't expect them to hand it to me to open 2 weeks after mine got stolen with it fresh in my mind). I then told my brother I had to leave after telling my parents off for not considering how I'd feel when they had given my sister the present to have me open and we left.\n\nLater my mother and I talked and she apologized for not considering my feelings but I still can't help but feel like I overreacted when they were just trying to include me in their family event, but I still feel like they spit in my face. So am I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit: When I say they got it for the family, that only really means for their household, I haven't lived with my parents in nearly 10 years and rarely get to visit. That's why I make it a point to attend holidays. A lot of the comments have pointed out that it sounds like they gave me the gift or were replacing it, but they had effectively gotten themselves a switch and had me open it. That's why it felt malicious at the time, just to further elaborate on that. \n\nAnd again, it wasn't a malicious thing they did by having me open it, but they didn't elaborate on that until later on, but with our history I took it maliciously at the time because it's what I've grown up expecting.", "created_utc": 1673807529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cr1c8/aita_for_leaving_my_family_on_christmas_after/", "score": 286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's ways to increase the odds but those themselves have more pre-requisites you to meet. It on average takes around 6 hours 1 particular Pokemon doing it the way I did it, not counting the shinies which have their own particular odds they follow and charts for obtaining them throughout various games or actual gameplay that has to be done to obtain items for competitive play. Just cause I like talking about Pokemon this clarification gave me a way to provide more context with how much time I lost lol.\n\nAnd I agree, I should've stuck around longer to find out if it was malicious or not, but it seemed like something they'd do maliciously since they've done worse intentionally and with me being hungover, I didn't wanna stay there if that was gonna be how they started the day.", "If they are \u2018everyone\u2019 presents, who opens them?

Like if your sibling has one already I would've thought it nice if they had gotten you one then or maybe some money to get there. And yes I understand why it sucks. I am actually an avid gamer myself and played for competitive world ranks so I am not saying it's \"just a game\". But I just felt when you talked about them putting that in your face too soon after yours got stolen it sounded similiar to how people talk when tetraumatized and if it is that bad then your attachment to it was likely somewhat unhealthy. Anyway I am sorry this happened, both your hard work being taken from you as the christmas situation.", "No, that can't be it because OP says in a comment that he bought the sister her own switch.", "Correct me if I'm wrong but, it seems like your upset that they bought something for themselves then acted like it was a gift to you. It's not the gift, or pack thereof, that you're upset about. It's the way they went about it. I don't even know what to call how they acted.

I can't imagine many people or parents that would expect someone that age to be so cut up by losing a gaming console. Let alone plot to upset him by buying something quite expensive and then deliberately adding to this devious plot by having his sister give it to him. The family may be toxic, but OP hasn't given any further context. So from this post alone, OP seems extremely sensitive, almost paranoid and imo, massively overreacted to the situation.", "I still don't get it, so they gave you a switch that wasn't yours to have then? Apart from their terrible taste in gift giving, I still don't get why you get that upset about it...? To them a switch is just for gameplaying, you take it much more serious. Too serious perhaps?", "So did they not get him any Christmas presents at all?\nBut I\u2019m really confused about why these people should have known that a 26-year-old man would have a temper tantrum over not getting a Nintendo switch for Christmas. This is so bizarre to me. Are they $1000? If it\u2019s that vital for OP survival can he not go purchase one for himself?\nI\u2019m sorry this whole thing doesn\u2019t feel real at all if someone trolling", "OK so he can go buy one he has a job how much do they cost are they $5000? I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m even reading here. A grown man had a temper tantrum and left Christmas because he didn\u2019t get a video game player from his mommy?", "I thought the sister just handed it to them", "They gave it to him to open, it's his! They might not have intended that... They might have had some psychotic little game planned here, But when you give somebody their Christmas gift to open you don't get to say Oh I'm keeping that. You gave it to them, it's theirs now! No matter what you try to say afterwards", "So now that they bought one for the family maybe your little sister will give you back the one you gave her if you\u2019re really that heartbroken you lost yours and you can\u2019t buy another one. Would that fix the problem?", "Then he can buy his own Switch.", "I\u2019m sorry, but playing Pok\u00e9mon and drinking too much are possibly things you should reconsider.", "No. But she gave me 20$ later (which I tried to turn down).

Now I\u2019m wondering if my family is weird because I opened my presents and my brother would open his presents. And back when we were little enough to believe in Santa if there was a household gift from Santa we would open it together or we would take turns opening household gifts or whatever but it was very clear that it was a household gift before it got opened", "I did see that further down in a comment. I think I misread the original post but he also said the bought the switch for themselves (mom and dad). Point still stands they bought a switch that OP cannot really use as they don\u2019t live there and had them open it then announce it\u2019s for the family.", "To clarify this thread, the Switch was basically for my parents because I had gotten my little sister one. They gave the Switch to my little sister to have me open it.", "I mean, it's a mix of that and the item in particular, if they had opened the same gift themselves, I doubt I would've even batted an eye, or if they had given me another random gift (like the Playstation controller). I don't expect anything when I go over there, regardless of circumstances.", "My life doesn't really revolve around video games tbh, it's a hobby.

I had told her that I had booked flights and hotel rooms back when they announced events were restarting, so she knew it was more than gameplay.", "but they didn\u2019t..remember? the mom said it was for the FAMILY \u2018s household not OP\ud83d\udc80", "I don\u2019t know about any other gifts, but I don\u2019t think they were expecting a personal switch as a present - just not opening someone else\u2019s. I mean, they\u2019re like \u00a3200 (second hand) and about \u00a3250-300 (new) here in the UK which is a chunk of money that plenty of people can\u2019t afford to dish out without time to save.", "I didn't expect a gift, I know my family struggles financially, the part I was insulted by was them knowing how hurt I was over losing literal years of hard work and grinding and then having me open the same thing I had just lost that they had bought for themselves. As for why I don't buy another Switch, I can do it far easier than family could, and plan on it when the next model comes out, the issue wasn't that I can't or that they should've gotten me one.", "How do you not grasp that many many people don\u2019t have \u00a3200-300 ($300ish) to drop on something without a lot of saving up time? \nIt\u2019s a LOT of money for a huge part of the population. \nIt\u2019s also clear in the post that OP didn\u2019t expect to be bought a new switch, they just didn\u2019t feel particularly thrilled about opening one they\u2019ll likely never use.", "Yes, 300 dollars is a big investment for someone working retail.\n\nWhat world do you live in?\n\nAnd is it normal in that world to have someone else unwrap presents you're giving yourself??", "nope.", "I'm actually buying the next model expected to come out later this year/next year and would never ask my little sister to give me her switch, she actually offered to give it to me when she found out mine was stolen but I told her it'd be fine and we couldn't play if she did that.\n\nThe thing that really breaks my heart about the switch is just the time and invested into getting perfect stat'd Pokemon and shinys, and unfortunately, Pokemon doesn't support cloud saves so short of putting all that work and time in again, nothing really fixes that lol", "He says he plans to.\n\nBut it's still fucking weird to have someone else unwrap a present you're giving yourself.", "I actually only drink sociably (whether with family or friends) and this was the first time I had drunken in 6 months and I only had a couple shots of Whisky and a glass of eggnog (thank you for your concern on that front though, it was something I had to work on previously) as for the Pokemon, it's really just a hobby in my free time, it just consumes a lot of free time. I still held active relationships, watched popular shows, went out and socialized outside of it, honestly, unless I told you, you'd never know I played. In reality, Pokemon only took up maybe 10-15 hours of my life a week unless I was sick or didn't have any social obligations to attend to. But it also did use to be a big problem til I forced myself to slowdown, that's why I had thousands of hours logged lol.", "OP, gifts are gestures of affection. There are other kinds, but gifts are one. A lot of people try to diminish that, call them greedy or materialistic or performative, and sure, they can be - but so can any gesture. Gifts don't have to be expensive, they just have to say that the other person was thinking about you and wanted to please you in some way.\n\nWhat I'm getting here is that not only were you the only one of their children who didn't get that gesture of affection, no matter how tokenish (they could get multiple electronics but couldn't go 2for1 on that box of chocolates?), they got another child to perform fake gift giving to you and made a big deal out of you leaving a gift-giving holiday with empty hands. After forgetting to pick you up for Christmas. I actually believe you that the Switch thing wasn't malicious. Your parents appear genuinely incapable of understanding their own actions.\n\nI worry that you're 26 and think being treated this way is fine, because you deserve better.", "i completely get that! good luck!", "Yeah I also found it weird but thought maybe it's a kind of letting them have something to open even if it's not for them? But like with my family when we grew older and wouldn't get as many boxes as the little ones and instead one pricy thing like a phone we would get some boxes with inexpensive stuff like chocolate just to make up for one box against a pile. And because we would have like the routine of opening one gift each in a row then second gift in a row and otherwise it would just be always the same people opening gifts and everyone else watching. Never once did I get a gift to open that was meant for someone else.", "So you're saying that your parents got themselves a gift, and then had you open it? So that you could just like, hand it back to them? Because if so that's super weird and I'll change my judgement lol", "Simple, they gave it to you to open so it's yours! They don't get to buy themselves a gift and give it to you to open but not be able to keep! It's yours", "So this is weird, at Christmas you guys just open everybody else\u2019s Christmas presents? Is that how you guys have always done it? I don\u2019t even know what to say here because in my house growing up we would just open our own Christmas presents.", "So you visit your family for Christmas, everyone gets gifts they can themselves use and they gave you \"family\" gifts that stay there? Either they're trying to passive aggressively get you to come over more or they don't care enough about you to give you thoughtful gifts. \n\nMy ex-MIL used to give my girls gifts that had to stay at her house. Two hours away. They were very young. Ex sided with her (always did). It was a very tearful ride home. They asked for those toys for days. This smacks of her BS.", "I don't know your parents, but I think they had no clue! To me it also sounds like a fun hobby, nothing to get upset over. She apologized for being inconsiderate and so you're all good. Water under the bridge and all.", "Basically this, I didn't expect anything tbh. I can go out and buy a new Switch and Scarlet and Violet right now and all it'd mean is I can't order delivery til next check. But to them, buying a new Switch means they can't go see my aunts and uncles for a month, there's a massive difference and in our situations and I'd never expect them to spend money like that on something I could very easily do.", "Honestly, it does hurt sometimes but it's always been this way. My S/O and I have actually talked about it many times because of reasons exactly like this one. This one wasn't malicious, my mother would've said something like, \"just grow up,' or something along that lines if it was, but so many others have been. I love my little sister so I tolerate it for the most part lol but yea, it's really not fine. I do appreciate your concern random redditor <3", "Thanks amazing random redditor <3", "Basically yea, I don't think they're assholes or anything for it after talking to them, I just don't know if I'm in the wrong for storming out the way I did.", "Yeah it sounds like this family just opens presents and it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s present it is? Does anybody else do Christmas like that I\u2019ve never heard of this?", "As funny as that woulda been, I don't think in good consciousness I could even make that joke lol", "Basically yea, this one wasn't malicious though. It was just her not thinking about it at the time, which I didn't find out about til a week later.", "Yea, I don't think they're assholes for this in particular, I just wanted to know if at the time I was justified in feeling insulted and leaving or not. Like do I need to apologize or is it understandable? Like we talked and made up but I still can't help but feeling bad for putting a somber note on their Christmas you know?", "Usually we each receive our own individual gifts and then my sister opens the remaining ones. I have no idea why they switched it up this year.", "Not a joke. When they try to say it was actually for them make them explain. Say stuff like \"No, it couldn't have been for you or you wouldn't have had me open it\" \"Why would you do that?\" When they say it's funny or whatever excuse, you say \"explain the joke to me\" \"how was it funny?\" \"We're you purposely trying to hurt me?\" Keep going with it! Just keep digging in with why would they do that and are they trying to hurt you? And you don't understand if you opened it, it should be yours! And then just take it home with you! They wanted to fuck around, they can find out! Just don't let them walk all over you!", "I would just let bygones be bygones. If it really bothers you, then by all means apologize. But if you think it's the right thing to do, I wouldn't worry about it. You already talked it out with your mom, so it probably is just water under the bridge. Hopefully they learned from it and come up with a decent present next Xmas \ud83d\ude0a", "To me buying a new Switch is 1/7 of a paycheck, to them buying a new switch is 1 month without going to see my elderly grandpa or my family on the otherside of the state. It's a lot more to them than it is to me. I could never seriously take such a big purchase from them even if it was to maliciously comply. But it woulda been funny to see the look on their face if I did lmao", "ESH. I see how they bruised your feelings, but your reaction is more for someone half your age.", "Based on your edits and the comments you've made, I'd say NTA.  Not because you assumed the Switch was a \"malicious\" gift, but because they basically invited you over and had you open \"family presents\" with nothing for you.  What was the point of that?  So your sister would feel like you are included?  She's already got a Switch (that you gave her), and your parents got one for themselves (\"for the family!\"), and they can't even give you a box of chocolate like your brother got?  Even if they are having money troubles, if they can afford a second Switch for their household, they can afford to give you a paperback book or some candy or something.  That, and it sounds like there's a lot of history there that you haven't really gone into that led to your stronger reaction.", "NTA. Hope you continue competing.", "NTA Giving you a gift that you are expected to leave with them and hardly ever use\u2026 sucks\u2026 They should have given you a bottle of alcohol and called it a day.", "NTA I'd of taken the switch with me.", "NAH - they weren\u2019t malicious and you were upset. But can\u2019t help but think you\u2019re too old to be putting this much stock in video games. Maybe it\u2019s a sign", "Kinda gross opinion really. Some people like video games, some people like sports. Nobody blinks an eye when a group of sports fans burn down some cars because their team won or lost. But a 30 year old plays video games and its all \u201cthats just for kids\u201d. Why don\u2019t you tell us your hobby and we can point out how you shouldn\u2019t take it so seriously.", "If it\u2019s for you, teach them a lesson. Take it home with you. They can\u2019t do anything about it. It\u2019s your gift.", "Honestly, you missed your chance to be malicious back and just \u201cmisunderstand\u201d and take it with you. \n\nNTA and I\u2019m sorry your parents are crap.", "Gifts with strings are not gifts, they're obligations", "Sorry, that sounds really sucky", "NTA and I think it was malicious IMHO they are acting on : you moved out? Here is what your missing", "You should have just taken it home\u2026.see what they say then. It was addressed to you in the first place.", "Bro I had a seizure trying to understand this shit. Also if you have a job save like a dollar a day for a year and get a switch or something", "YTA, man why are even crying in the first place about them buying a switch for the house and making you open it? You are a grown man, act like it and buy yourself a new one", "It might not be universal, but we get family gifts every Christmas. These are usually board games or similar, things that we would all use together. When we were younger, and if we were getting a big family gift (like a console), we would all open it together if the box was big enough.\n\nNowadays we just take turns opening family gifts. It's known ahead of time and separate from the individual gifts.", "If OP was simply complaining about his family's seriously weird custom, that would be one thing. The fact that he is a 26yo man moaning about his Gameboy will color some people's opinions.", "I would be totally mean and give him back the $20 while saying \"here, you forgot about this one and it's clearly something for the family\" and then cut off contact.", "To rub your face in it.", "So let me straight, they got a switch for themselves (that you won't be even able to use), made you open it, then announced its for the family (so you won't confused or something)? \n\nYeah, NTA. \nWhat present did you actually get?", "YTA. Grow up.", "I get it.. I get that your family sucks a bit here, and if you were 14, I'd totally be on your side, but... you're 26.\n\nYou're an adult living outside of the home, GM of a store, and devastated about game saves?\n\nThis just doesn't sound healthy to me.\n\nI'm going ESH because I think there is a lot of weird and unhealthy things going on here, but I think more importantly I think maybe you should talk to someone, your actions and behaviours just don't seem like those of a man your age.", "Yeah I got it after the edit, but for half the post I though the problem was that the new switch reminded him of all the progress he lost", "If you don't mind my asking, have you not cut contact because of your little sister? \n\nAlso, I get how important games can be, and how crushing it would be to lose so much progress. I don't play Pok\u00e9mon, but I still know a \"shiny\" is a big deal. \n\nMy husband and I played a ridiculous amount of Borderlands 2, and we spent countless hours farming for the best gear. I then spent even more hours making copies, and creating characters as \"banks.\" If I'd lost all that effort during our peak playing time, I'd be upset too. \n\nHow you feel is valid. It's no different than people putting time into their own different hobbies. I really hope you'll be able to enjoy it again soon."]}
