This is an update to my previous post, which you can find on my profile. First, I just want to thank everyone again for how kind and supportive you have all been but also how honest. I took everything to heart and everyone's advice was great! Now onto the update.\n\nI met my friend at around 9am yesterday at a local coffee shop, she looked really bad, her hair was super greasy and unkempt, she had really bad eye bags, and she seemed totally exhausted. When I asked her what was wrong she just apologized. I kept prodding and it turns out that her in laws are real pieces of work. Apparently they've been harassing her for nearly 3 years about having SIL as the MOH at the wedding and when my friend chose me they went ballistic. My friend said she thought she'd be able to handle it until the wedding day but then MIL threatened to ruin her wedding unless SIL was the MOH. My friend panicked and that's when she told me I would no longer be MOH. She apologized for the money hungry comment and said that she was just in such an awful place mentally that hearing me mention the money made her really upset.\n\nThe reason all our friends were attacking me is because they knew about the MIL situation, as my friend never mentioned it to me because she didn't want me to step down because of MIL, and they thought I also knew the whole story. And as for the fiance, he was completely in the dark. He doesn't have a good relationship with his mother already and my friend didn't want to be what destroyed that relationship.\n\nWhen my friend told me all this I felt awful, I didn't know she was enduring three years of harassment because of me. I immediately apologized and she apologized and we both cried a lot. When the tears stopped she pulled out an envelope with $200 and gave it to me, I originally refused but she insisted so I took it. I encouraged her to tell her fiance because keeping this from him wasn't helping anyone and if he decided to cut off MIL then that was his decision, not hers. \n\nAfter talking a lot more about future boundaries, our friendship, and the wedding, I decided I would go to the wedding and we'd still be friends. I know my friend didn't handle this in the best way but I've know her for over 2 decades and she's practically my platonic soulmate. That's not something you should throw away because if this.\n\nOriginally that was how my update ended, but as I was typing this I recieved a text from my friend saying that fiance disinvited his mom and practically half the family, including SIL, because of their treatment of my friend and me. She asked if I would be willing to be the MOH again and I said yes.\n\nI just want to give a final thank you to reddit for helping me through this and I hope all of you have a nice night.", "created_utc": 1700243878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xkvig/update_aita_for_not_attending_my_best_friends/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Original post located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17svnv8/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_best_friends/)", "Wow, what an emotional rollercoaster! It's amazing to see how your friendship has stood the test of time and endured through this difficult situation. It takes a lot of strength to forgive and move forward, and I truly admire that. Wishing you all the best for the wedding, and kudos to the fiance for taking a stand against the toxic behavior. Reddit really came through with some solid advice, as always. Stay strong!", "Kudos to your friend *and* her fianc\u00e9 for open communication (even at this late date) and for fianc\u00e9 standing up to his entire family. That isn\u2019t easy to do, but I bet it\u2019s a weight off their shoulders. Congratulations to them and best wishes for the future. I hope you all have a blast at the wedding!!", "Great ending to the story. \n\nI'm happy everything worked out for you and your friend.", "A happy ending \u2764\ufe0f. I hope your friend has a beautiful wedding.", "Love this update. I\u2019m so glad your friendship survived this craziness. Also, her fianc\u00e9 is a keeper, clearly!", "Have things been clarified with the other friends, and did they apologize to OP?", "That was a wild ride. One of the nices updates to read, especially with that new part!", "NTA if true....just can't quite believe you were her bestie and didn't know at all what the deal was? For THREE years? And everyone else knew?", "Thank you so much! \ud83d\udc95", ">He doesn't have a good relationship with his mother already and my friend didn't want to be what destroyed that relationship.\n\nTell her \"Yes you do!\""]}
