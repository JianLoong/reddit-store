This is an update to my previous post, which you can find on my profile. First, I just want to thank everyone again for how kind and supportive you have all been but also how honest. I took everything to heart and everyone's advice was great! Now onto the update.\n\nI met my friend at around 9am yesterday at a local coffee shop, she looked really bad, her hair was super greasy and unkempt, she had really bad eye bags, and she seemed totally exhausted. When I asked her what was wrong she just apologized. I kept prodding and it turns out that her in laws are real pieces of work. Apparently they've been harassing her for nearly 3 years about having SIL as the MOH at the wedding and when my friend chose me they went ballistic. My friend said she thought she'd be able to handle it until the wedding day but then MIL threatened to ruin her wedding unless SIL was the MOH. My friend panicked and that's when she told me I would no longer be MOH. She apologized for the money hungry comment and said that she was just in such an awful place mentally that hearing me mention the money made her really upset.\n\nThe reason all our friends were attacking me is because they knew about the MIL situation, as my friend never mentioned it to me because she didn't want me to step down because of MIL, and they thought I also knew the whole story. And as for the fiance, he was completely in the dark. He doesn't have a good relationship with his mother already and my friend didn't want to be what destroyed that relationship.\n\nWhen my friend told me all this I felt awful, I didn't know she was enduring three years of harassment because of me. I immediately apologized and she apologized and we both cried a lot. When the tears stopped she pulled out an envelope with $200 and gave it to me, I originally refused but she insisted so I took it. I encouraged her to tell her fiance because keeping this from him wasn't helping anyone and if he decided to cut off MIL then that was his decision, not hers. \n\nAfter talking a lot more about future boundaries, our friendship, and the wedding, I decided I would go to the wedding and we'd still be friends. I know my friend didn't handle this in the best way but I've know her for over 2 decades and she's practically my platonic soulmate. That's not something you should throw away because if this.\n\nOriginally that was how my update ended, but as I was typing this I recieved a text from my friend saying that fiance disinvited his mom and practically half the family, including SIL, because of their treatment of my friend and me. She asked if I would be willing to be the MOH again and I said yes.\n\nI just want to give a final thank you to reddit for helping me through this and I hope all of you have a nice night.", "created_utc": 1700243878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xkvig/update_aita_for_not_attending_my_best_friends/", "score": 1855, "replies": ["Original post located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17svnv8/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_best_friends/)", "Wow, what an emotional rollercoaster! It's amazing to see how your friendship has stood the test of time and endured through this difficult situation. It takes a lot of strength to forgive and move forward, and I truly admire that. Wishing you all the best for the wedding, and kudos to the fiance for taking a stand against the toxic behavior. Reddit really came through with some solid advice, as always. Stay strong!", "Kudos to your friend *and* her fianc\u00e9 for open communication (even at this late date) and for fianc\u00e9 standing up to his entire family. That isn\u2019t easy to do, but I bet it\u2019s a weight off their shoulders. Congratulations to them and best wishes for the future. I hope you all have a blast at the wedding!!", "Great ending to the story. \n\nI'm happy everything worked out for you and your friend.", "A happy ending \u2764\ufe0f. I hope your friend has a beautiful wedding.", "Love this update. I\u2019m so glad your friendship survived this craziness. Also, her fianc\u00e9 is a keeper, clearly!", "Have things been clarified with the other friends, and did they apologize to OP?", "That was a wild ride. One of the nices updates to read, especially with that new part!", "NTA if true....just can't quite believe you were her bestie and didn't know at all what the deal was? For THREE years? And everyone else knew?", "Thank you so much! \ud83d\udc95", ">He doesn't have a good relationship with his mother already and my friend didn't want to be what destroyed that relationship.\n\nTell her \"Yes you do!\"", "Poor thing ,this is why you really need to be able to talk to your partner. She underwent three years of harassment for no good reason because she was too afraid to speak up.", "3 years of you not knowing how her MIL was treating her but everyone else knew? Like even before the wedding she never told you MIL is a peace of work but she found time to tell everyone else?\n\nI\u2019m glad it\u2019s resolved but huh????", "I'm glad y'all made up but your friend needs to set things straight with her family and the other friends that were talking bad to you.  They owe you an apology also.\n\nThey need to set passwords with vendors so mil cannot sabotage anything and hire security to keep them out of the wedding because they will probably try to crash it", "If you guys are \u201cplatonic souls mates\u201d why didn\u2019t she tell you any of this for the past three years? I feel like a best friends advice would\u2019ve been really helpful. It\u2019s takes a lot of effort to purposely not tell someone about a situation this stressful.\n\nAlso, if her friends thought you knew about the MIL situation, how have they never talked about it with you for three years? It feels like they were all keeping secrets from you and then getting mad at you for your understandable reaction. Have those friends apologized to you?", "Hm... OP, you are better then me. I would go LC with this friends and the others for awhile.\n\nThis person was being threatened by her MIL and SIL, merely guests at the wedding knowing that her fianc\u00e9 didn't have the best relationship with his mom instead of tell him the truth.\n\nAnd she told to all your friends abour MIL's behavior but not you? And they all defended her without even knowing with you knew the full story\n\nSounds BS, but glad you two talked.", "So glad everything turned out better in the end. I hope your friend is doing okay and that the in-laws don\u2019t give you any more trouble.", "Have your friends who ganged up on you apologized at all?", "This was a really nice update. Life is tough and sometimes people don't handle things the way they should. I'm really glad your friend apologized and you guys are remaining such close friends!", "We love a happy ending! I hope her wedding goes smoothly, and all the best to you, OP!", "Omg. Thanks for sharing a wonderful and successful conclusion for you, your friend and her fianc\u00e9.  Made my day.", "This is a good outcome OP, not just for you but for your friend and her future husband.  Best to have everything aired out.", "It\u2019s amazing how quickly the fianc\u00e9 reacted once she finally told him how his fat had been treating her. Nice things were resolved hopefully the wedding itself goes off without anymore trouble", "Wow... thanks for the updates. Your poor friend has been abused by her in laws.  You got caught in the crossfire.  I hope she continues to be honest with you and your friendship survives.\n\nPlease know that you standing up for yourself led her to do the same eventually.", "She needed a mil babysitter/behavior monitor.", "Idk I feel like you didnt owe her no apology. Why was it so hard for her to just tell you what was going on if she told the rest of her friends?", "Wow, your poor friend. She sounds like she's been tortured, and while it was ugly for you, at least people didn't have bad intentions. Well, except the wicked MIL. I'm glad your friend came clean to you and to her SO and that they will now have a happy wedding with people around them who wish them joy. I'm sorry you went through this, but I'm happy the situation and friendship was salvageable.", "YES!!So good of the fianc\u00e9!", "Some of these do have happy endings. I\u2019m glad your friends fianc\u00e9 stood up for her.", "Glad friend isn't going to have to deal with MIL her whole married life.", "I am so glad that her fiance found out about how his Mom and Sis were treating his wife.\n\nNot everyone has a hallmark perfect family.   And trying to pretend a dysfunctional family is a hallmark perfect family hurts everyone involved.", "OMG that is awesome and I'm so happy for your and your friend!", "Good to see a hopeful ending, but *JESUS CHRIST* why do good people have such cancerous family?", "Yea it was clear that there was some kind of emotional abuse happening behind the scenes and the in-laws were pressuring your friend.  I\u2019m really glad you could continue to be her support.", "All's Well That Ends Well", "Omgoodness! I wish everyone the best.", "What a mess! Just want to say you're a wonderful friend.", "Amazing have a fantastic day", "Oh wow. Well, I'm glad that your friend isn't an asshole, she was just under enormous pressure, so you're not going to lose the friendship. And it sucks that a huge portion of the family has to be blocked from the wedding, but hopefully it means it will be a much, much better time and your friend will actually enjoy her wedding. I hope you guys have a fabulous time!", "Here's hoping you have a great wedding! You now have a very good chance of that.", "> fiance disinvited his mom and practically half the family, including SIL, because of their treatment of my friend and me.\n\nAww, he got his bride the **_best_ wedding present of all**!", "Your \"best friend\" would have been an miserable fool for going through with this marriage without resolving this issue. Luckily She and her fiance finally implemented hard boundaries on the fiance's family after she communicated with her partner what was going on. So there is hope in this relationship.", "Love fiance. Good for him", "Shit that took a turn.\n\nI actually read the original post and I thought your friend was being a total jerk. Turns out I was wrong. She was being pressured by toxic family members. She was fucking borderline threatened by her \u201cMIL.\u201d I guess you truly don\u2019t know what goes on behind closed doors.\n\nYou handled this perfectly, and frankly, so did your friend. I\u2019m so glad you guys were able to mend your friendship, and I\u2019m glad you were able to help her out. Also, props to your friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9 for taking initiative and cutting off his toxic family members. \n\n\nI hope everything goes well, and I hope you have a wonderful time at the wedding!", "Omg I\u2019m so glad I read to the end \ud83e\udd79 Congratulations to you and your bestie, this is wonderful.", "All of this! It is nice that the bride apologized, but it is also on her to clear the air with the other friends and help make amends between them and OP.\n\nI can sympathize with the stress Bride was under, but it does not negate the hurt done to OP by their other friends because of her actions.", "Yeah somehow everyone knew except her and groom??? Somehow her friends knew but never brought it up? Either they somehow never brought it up or the bride would've had to say not to tell her, but then the friends wouldn't be mad at her because they would've known she didn't know.", "I\u2019m so happy this worked out but my heart goes out to your friend too for having to deal with MIL. I hope they have a beautiful wedding and that you enjoy yourself.", "Exactly! OP is supposed to be a doormat and accept what she rightfully perceived as rude behavior *and* be incredibly understanding of a situation *she didn't know about*?? Because what even were these messages?\n\n\"You asshole, you don't know what Bride is going thru!!!\"\n\nErgh, *no*, she did not, because no one told *her*, the person who *should* know the most (after the groom), since *she was the fucking MOH*.\n\nI don't even comprehend how a) this secret stayed hidden for literal years b) how, even fully knowing she didn't know, it seemed like a fantastic idea to harass her as if she *did* know, except *obviously she did not*, because it was actively hidden from her.\n\nI don't know, man, but if OP was not asked to be MOH, she was just a guest, *maybe* I would understand the secret (I mean, not really but for this argument), but she was the one who would be forced out if the bride caved to pressure, and also, OP is the one who was potentially going to suffer the consequences *at the wedding* if the SIL or MIL wanted to say or do something on the day.\n\nSo OP could well have happily been a MOH just to have *whatever* be done or said to her during the reception, and she'd stand there like ????", "> The reason all our friends were attacking me is because they knew about the MIL situation, as my friend never mentioned it to me because she didn't want me to step down because of MIL, and they thought I also knew the whole story.\n\nI think this explains that away pretty well enough", "Didn't think of that - good point!  But then her phone wouldn't have blown up! lol", ">Originally that was how my update ended, but as I was typing this I recieved a text from my friend saying that fiance disinvited his mom and practically half the family, including SIL, because of their treatment of my friend and me. She asked if I would be willing to be the MOH again and I said yes.\n\n\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc\n\nShe owed you that. Awful in-laws are one thing, but there is no excusing her deliberate refusal to *communicate* with you. The fact that her situation had to be dragged out of her at gunpoint after the way she treated you is something I would have a serious conversation with her about *after* the wedding. If you two are \u201cplatonic soulmates,\u201d then she needs to know that it\u2019s extremely uncool to hide her struggles and then blow up on you out of nowhere. \n\nThe fact that she also withheld all this from her fianc\u00e9 is a *problem*. I don\u2019t know when your friend became convinced that it\u2019s better to keep secrets than to communicate with the people closest to her, but she needs to fix that. She nearly blew up a friendship because of this - she doesn\u2019t want to blow up a marriage by repeating that mistake.", "I\u2019d disinvite the fianc\u00e9 if I were her.", "This is such a great update to read! I hope you have fun and enjoy the wedding and I'm glad to hear you're the MOH again and her fiance cut out his mom and sister. Good for him!", "Your bestie is marrying a great guy!", "I believe this until the update.  Oh well.", "I'm so glad for you - it all worked out well in the end and your friend is better off too. Thank goodness! Hope the wedding is incredible! X", "I don\u2019t understand why the MIL was so invested on having her daughter as the MOH.", "Such a fantastic update! I'm so happy for you and your Bestie!   \nThis will be so much better for her future with her Soon to Be!  \nCongratulations on MOH duties and restored friendship strengthened! I hope you all have an AMAZING day!", "WOW \ud83e\udd2f!", "I remember thinking during your last post how sad it was that your friendship wouldn't survive this, I'm glad I was wrong", "Wow! What a turn of events. the truth comes out and thankfully for you, your friend, and her fiance. Happy wedding!!!", "Oh, I'm so glad your friend told her fiance, and so happy you two maintained your friendship.", "Hey OP so thrilled you and your friend talked through this. I commented on the original post and it def seemed to me like your friend bowed to in law pressure (rather than treating you like an ATM). Weddings bring out the worst in people, sometimes.\n\nThe one thing I initially struggled with a bit was this: \"And as for the fiance, he was completely in the dark.\" I found it hard to believe that an adult man wouldn't know that his mother was this controlling or that his fiancee was being bullied (especially when all the fiancee's friends knew). However, the final update about him disinviting his own mother to the wedding demonstrates that clearly, he was sincere in his surprise and his desire to stand up to his mom. I just hope he and fiancee can communicate better about stuff like this in the future, and also that she communicates better with you! \n\nI'm sorry your friend went through this hell with controlling in laws and I'm really glad she and her husband put their collective foot down over it. This type of thing never stops, and if they give in, all that'll show MIL is she can get away with it forever.\n\nI am also a little boggled that the MOH duties couldn't be shared between two people, but what do I know.", "Found it strange as well :-). I would guess that her friend vented to others AFTER the fight, and maybe neglected to tell them that OP didn't knew it.", "Adults have lives, some best friends see each orher every other month", "There\u2019s one more thing the bride needs to do that you didn\u2019t mention \u2014 she needs to tell all the mutual friends that she had deliberately kept you in the dark about MIL\u2019s pressure.", "Stay strong and my goodness what a rollercoaster you endured", "That seems the most likely option tbh", "I believed it until then.", "If you thought your friend was being wildly selfish, you wouldn't say something like \"You know how bad Family in law are to bride, right? Why would you make this harder?!?\"", "It explains from their mutual friends' point of view. But OP's friend is, if not an A H, definitely strange. She withheld important information for years from the two most important people in her life for .... reasons, yet others are aware of her problems? To the extent that they harass OP over this? And friend never came clean about not telling OP or at least tell her friends to leave OP alone? How long did she let their friends harass OP before she stepped up and explained her actions?\n\nFriend did not handle the situation well with OP at all. First by keeping OP in the dark about her role in the wedding being threatened, springing it all of a sudden and then throwing OP under the bus with their friends. I'm not saying that she is lying about her MIL situation, but when she presented her full story, she seems to have deliberately done it in a manner that portrays herself in the most sympathetic light so her screwing over OP can be soon forgotten or forgiven.\n\nOP had nothing to apologize for. Friend has been saving for their wedding for years, she can more than understand that money was a concern for OP too. There was no need to blow up over it and blame OP.\n\nI'm also wondering what fiance's reaction would have been if he knew OP was helping to plan for the wedding for years and suddenly his narcissistic sister shows up to be the MoH? Yeah, friend definitely did not think this through. She hurt her two favorite people in an attempt to please abusive relatives.\n\nI just hope she learns from this experience and understand her priorities and boundaries.", "I too find this bizarre af and honestly the bride sounds a little like someone who tries to please everyone and ends up pleasing none. (She's also 25, and this kind of family pressure is a LOT at any age, but esp when you're young). For OP's peace of mind and her future relationships, I do hope the bride gets a bit better at standing up for herself and her friends."]}
