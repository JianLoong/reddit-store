But there also isn\u2019t anything wrong with having boundaries, or having things that are \u201cjust yours\u201d that you\u2019re not comfortable sharing. Most kids have one special toy that they don\u2019t want to share, and that\u2019s okay. Adults also have things they don\u2019t like to share, in this case it\u2019s OP\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s hoodie. That\u2019s valid.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to have boundaries with family, and if family oversteps boundaries to the point of disrespect, it\u2019s natural to feel upset about it. Family should share with each other and family should love each other, but family should also respect each other.", "People are entitled to boundaries over their person, and their property. It's actually the healthy way to maintain interpersonal relationships. \n\nJust because you choose not to have the same boundaries with your family, doesn't make someone an AH for having different boundaries than you, with theirs.", "I get where you are coming from, but there is a big difference between borrowing everyday items and personal items. It's like the boyfriend sending her flowers, and then the mom taking them and putting them in her room. It's weird.", "Where did op says she scream at her mom?", "It\u2019s not really weird on OP\u2019s end, imo. A guy will usually give or lend one of his hoodies to his girlfriend. It\u2019s something personal between couples. It\u2019s odd for OP\u2019s mom to wear something that basically signifies her daughter\u2019s romantic/intimate relationship.", "Its weird for she wearing it in her own home where all her clothes are she could wear from. She doesn\u2019t have to wear that hoodie if she cold. She has her own clothes to wear. If she ran out of clean hoodies then thats on her for not being responsible enough to have clean clothes. \n\nYou just dont wear your children partner clothes unless it is absolutely necessary. \n\nPlus the mom doesn\u2019t have permission to even borrow the hoodie. Only op did from her bf.", "You mean when people were calmly and respectfully countering your points\u2026? No one villainized you, I\u2019m not sure why you took it that way. Sorry if you felt dogpiled on, but you are the one who actively chose to be the \u201cvillain\u201d by making this second comment meant to target and deride OP.", "Spotted a Brit", "Yeah this whole thing is just really weird, and honestly it seems like your mom is into your boyfriend.", "Setting the boundary after the fact makes it somewhat silly to blame the mother for not respecting the boundary.  \n\n\nYou don't get to act like someone should have known better when there was no communication beforehand to make sure she knows better.  The fact that she did not tell her mother this until after her mother \"did the thing\" means that it's kind of silly to fault the mother for failing to adhere to this boundary that didn't exist until after the event in question.  \n\n\nIf she wears it again, she's an asshole.  Refusing to take it off was... just kind of rude.  Being wrong or out of line does not automatically mean you're a prick, that you're a bad person or disrespectful.  I don't think this is severe enough to warrant such a ruling, I see your point, up until that last sentence anyways, condescending nonsense that assumes a far greater degree of ignorance on my part than is remotely reasonable, thanks for that, it's just that I think a lot of what people are upset at here is... small potatoes.  Irrelevant in the scheme of things.  Not worth the concern or any action, drastic or otherwise.  \n\n\nYes, I think the mom is wrong, but I don't think she's \"so wrong\" as to be an asshole, not given the circumstances (her house, kid wasn't home, it's a fucking shirt) nor the consequences (Fucking nothing, literally nothing, no bad things happened.)", "She didn't say she had an issue with her mom going into her room. And the mom obviously didn't realize the hoodie would be a trigger. So now she's made her point and it was never that serious", "yeah. I was just hoping for a bit more info as it feels like something is missing from in here. the mom is being weird and is more so on doubling down.   \n\n\njust was hoping for more info.", "The reason I question that is because my mum can be quite inappropriate even before I met my bf.", "Nope. Not silly at all. She set the boundary. Period. \n\nSo once again, you don't get to decide if someone else's boundaries are valid, or dictate how they have to express them in order to be taken seriously. The moment she said she wasn't okay with it, and her mom refused to respect that, she was deliberately, and knowingly violating her daughter's boundaries.\n\nYou respect people's boundaries. Period. No one ever has any excuse to do otherwise, and if they do ignore or violate other people's boundaries knowingly, then they are the AH. That's not debatable. \n\nHonestly it's really starting to sound like the reason you're arguing against this simple fact so hard, is because you yourself have been guilty of violating other people's boundaries, and don't want to have to acknowledge to yourself that, that is what you were actually doing.", "would you feel the same way if it was a father insisting on wearing something that belonged to his teenaged son's girlfriend?\n\nwearing the clothes of your child's spouse is a boundary i would HOPE that nobody would have to set. that's weird and nasty.\n\nalso, fun fact, parents can be predatory and creep on their children's SO's and/or attempt to seduce them. it's disgusting. is that a boundary you think needs to be set beforehand as well?", "Did you miss the part where the daughter addressed the issue, and set a clear boundary, and the mom completely ignored her? \n\nYou don't get to pretend that other people's boundaries aren't valid, just because it's not something that would bother you. Period.", "Inappropriate in what way? Sorry, I\u2019m so curious now!", "All other circumstances being equal, sure.  It's still weird, it's still kind of rude, but... like... it's not a war crime.  It's just not that big a deal one way or the other.  If this is your biggest issue, it's probably gonna be alright.", "It was never that serious. Why are you so upset the whole of this sub is to debate and give our opinions. Go take a Xanax, period.", "it doesn't have to be a war crime ?? things can still be weird and wildly inappropriate without being a \"war crime\". this would be a big deal to most.\n\nif OPs mom is genuinely socially incompetent, out of touch, and needs these basic things explained to her, that's one thing.\n\nbut doubling down and behaving indignantly the way she did is unacceptable", "They calmly refuted your position with correct information and you tell them to take a Xanax? lol gaslight much?", "I mean, how is it wildly inappropriate?  People keep saying it is, but there's no indication it's sexual or predatory or that mom is \"creeping\" any other way, so what we have is a mother overstepping and borrowing a shirt without permission, not the greatest thing in the world, by any means, but... like... also kind of within the authority \"sphere\" that is generally considered to belong to parents?  \n\n\nReddit is so hard one way or the other, you're either some kind of wonderful hero or basically-Hitler, and everyone complains about it all of the time here, but no one... likes... tries to be moderate ever.  \n\n\nLook at some of the subject matter that comes through this sub, all manner of abuse and generally shitty behavior, massive legal conflicts, horrible divorces, heartless and hurtful pranks, destruction of property, just... actual violence... all manner of triggering awfulness and terrible malice.  \n\n\nThis is just someone being... kinda rude?  A bottom-rung shirt-tyrant?  You can say they're TA and I'm not going to jump down your throat or call you crazy or make out like you're in any way unreasonable, I just... like... life is nuanced and we shouldn't treat it as if it's a strict black and white, awful or great...  This is so minor league that we should at least take the time to acknowledge that.  \n\n\nWe don't need to rage about boundaries or make absurd claims that they should always be respected, that's silly.  Any time you deal in absolutes you're being silly.  \"Don't take that shirt without asking\" is a boundary, and you can even argue that it should be unspoken, but when the person that wiped your ass for the first two years of your life does it, if that's their biggest bit of bad parenting, I dunno man, count your blessings and take one on the chin, get your shirt back and have an adult conversation about how it bothered you, fine, great, see if you can get an apology, fair, deserved, but... I dunno, I'm trying to practice what I preach a bit and dial it back a little, maintain a little perspective.  People saying this is a \"big deal\" see this WAY differently than I do, this couldn't be a smaller deal, no one's life is ruined, this shouldn't even ruin a day, compared to the heavy-hitting stuff that comes through here?  This is a blip, c'mon.", "Because this AITA is really not that serious to keep @ing me more than once over. I said my piece. Make an original reply instead of riding my ass bc there's way more interesting situations on this sub to get up in arms over tbh", "it's the context. a shirt is one thing, but the reasons that people in a *relationship* share clothing are largely romantic ... usually has something to do w/ it smelling like ur partner\n\nso when your own mother decides to wear your BF's clothes, and then doubles down on it, with a \"what are you gonna do about it?\" attitude, that's where it gets inappropriate. flat out bizarre, honestly. the creepiness comes mainly from how young OP and her bf are. like, it's already weird to wear someone else's boyfriends clothes, but the fact that it's specifically your *daughters* boyfriend and he's around your daughters age makes it even worse. because again, wearing your partners' clothes is largely a romantic thing. so there's rude and then there's inappropriate.\n\nmight be a blip 2 u but everyone is different, me personally if my mom did this it'd make my skin crawl\n\nofc there are other ppl who treat their children worse but that shouldn't be a metric for how anyone should feel about it. also, parents are required to wipe their kids' asses, LOL. nobody owes their parents anything for simply existing, it's not like they asked to be born and need care?\n\n\"you took care of me like you were legally required to so ig i'll be lenient w/ the fact that you're wearing my boyfriend's clothes\" would be an odd sentiment. nobody has to be grateful for not being abused by their parents. that's the bare minimum.\n\nit's just bad logic. ex. do people in a relationship need to be grateful that their partner isn't, like, beating them? i'd hope not lmao", "Wow, man. You are getting angry. It's not that serious."]}
