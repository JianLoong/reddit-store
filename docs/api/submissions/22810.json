My stepmother couldn't have kids so she agreed to let my dad be with someone else to have children. Hence me and my sister.\n\nFast forward to now. My mom passed when I was 15 though she was never in our life as my stepmother let's call her Ari. Ari (F73) has been married to my dad for 50 years. Everything was great for years. Up until my dad passed in March of 2023. Along comes my dads brother, my uncle (M70). He came to visit after the funeral and all other preparations. We thought it would have just been a one time thing. Then he started showing up more frequently and Eventually just doesn't want to leave. My sister moved out to be with her bf because she can't stand him he's always stealing our stuff (Money,jewelry etc).\n\nMy stepmother said she doesn't want to have anything to do with him until one night we caught them in bed together. Keep in mind it hasn't even been 4 months my dad died. This happened on Friday and I told them both they have until Sunday to move out as the house was in mine and my siblings name as joint tenants. They haven't moved out yet but She's preparing too move. I didn't me to say it but I was hurt. I mean 50 years with my dad and she could replace him after only 3 months. BTW my father and his brother look nothing alike. So AITA for kicking her out? Should I apologize and just accept the situation for what is? And if I do should i go LC? I'm still really mad and upset about the whole situation", "created_utc": 1689926573, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155hdv1/aita_for_kicking_my_stepmother_out/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was with his brother for a while. Her using your dads death as an excuse to have his brother over more often is her essentially spitting on your dads grave. This is disgusting behavior on your mothers part.", "NTA,\n\nYou're a little na\u00efve if you think that its the first time, they've probably been doing it since your dad was still alive.", "NTA I mean, are you really sure this is their first time? seems a little naive", "NTA- start whatever legal proceeding you need to do to get her evicted.  I read on a different post. It took them 8 months to evict their brother.  \n\nStart now.  Get everything on paper.  Go through the legal channels.", "NTA.\n\nDon't think it's necessarily that bad that your stepmother is having a new \"friend\" already. What exactly is the appropriate \"grieving period\", and who should decide that? she is 73, lives too short to be miserable, when you can be happy and enjoy it. On the other hand, she is moving on, its you and your siblings place, and you want to move on too, perfectly okay to ask her to move out.", "NTA I think LC until you calm down but not permanently.", "Not the asshole. Uncle needs to go. The stepmother I'm torn on, people do different things in time of grief that isn't healthy, but sleeping with someone and moving on are too different things. If you think it's best for you and your siblings, yes kick them out.", "NTA!! \n\nYou are definitely not the Asshole the uncle 100% is though he needs to go no questions asked. \n \nPlaying devil's advocate here I know but before the step mum/mum goes maybe just sit down one on one with her and talk about her reasons behind it grief can do terrible things to people and although what she did was wrong sometimes people can and do take advantage of people's grief (uncle) don't leave yourself with regrets. If \n\nYou are grieving enough after losing your father just make sure you, you get a chance to say your thoughts and try and get some closure but in the end whether she stays or goes you need to do what's best for you in times like these you have to be selfish and think of your own mental state.  Sending love \u2764", "I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your father. Losing parents is never easy, and especially not when you're so young (and harder again still when it's the second parent you have lost).\n\nBy the sounds of it, your step mom was a good partner to your father and has been a good parent to you and your siblings. Certainly she sounds like someone you can talk to.\n\nYour feelings of betrayal and anger are valid, but that doesn't mean she has to grieve on your timetable. It's possible that what is between her and your uncle is just a temporary thing indulged in for comfort in the grief. Or it could be that although he's been a bad uncle to you, he may always have made her feel special. She is probably extremely lonely and bereft at the moment and he might feel safe. In any case, her sex life is her business.\n\nI recommend trying to mend this bridge with her and rescind your demand that she moves out. Having parental support from someone who has been a good parent to you, makes it easier to be an adult, especially while you learn who you are. You are allowed to change your mind AND you are allowed to state boundaries. For example, you can say that you don't want him (in particular) to visit.\n\nIn any case, grief is hard and makes us make bad decisions sometimes. Best of luck.\n\nNAH", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
