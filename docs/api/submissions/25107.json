My mom is very possessive and controlling over all her relationships. Mine, especially. Over the years, I\u2019ve just kind of let her walk all over me and let her get her way in some fashion and move on. She has controlled where we live, what schools we sent our kids to, what vacations we have taken, etc\u2026 the most recent blow up we had was over what church she wanted to go to. She\u2019s a church hopper, I\u2019m not. She wanted to start going to church with us but wanted us to uproot where we were established. I refused. Then, we recently went on a vacation with my in laws (the first time we have ever gone on vacation with them in 15 years\u2026 we\u2019ve gone on vacation every year with my parents for the last 11) and she\u2019s been making snide comments about that since. So, going into this issue, she was already mad at me. \n\nWell, 1.5 years ago, she moved all my sister\u2019s stuff into our house without asking us. My sister was in between homes and she did this while we were at work. She told my sister we could store it in our garage for free since we weren\u2019t really using it. We literally came home one day and couldn\u2019t park in the garage. My husband was irritated but he didn\u2019t want the drama with my mom\u2026 well he didn\u2019t want me to deal with her drama so he let it go. Well, my sister has since moved twice and hasn\u2019t taken any of her stuff. So, my husband told her he wanted it out so he could use his garage. He gave her 90 days and said if it\u2019s not gone by then, he will get rid of it.  Needless to say, it started a huge argument with my mother. She called me and demanded to know why my sister had to get her stuff. I explained my husband has been wanting to use the garage to park the car so he get out the basketball goal for our kids and they can use the driveway. She felt that was unnecessary and we could just take the kids to the park. In the midst of this argument, she told him he could go and eat shit for being a selfish human being. She thinks that he should just keep all my sister\u2019s stuff because she doesn\u2019t want to pay for storage. She thinks that he is being petty for wanting to us his garage. \n\nWhen she did this, I confronted her. I told her it was disrespectful to not only him but to me, his wife. I told her that she is my mother, but he is my husband first and I won\u2019t tolerate her being so vile about him moving forward. She disagrees and is now accusing me of being disrespectful for not agreeing with her and taking my husband\u2019s side.

I get it and won\u2019t disagree. Unfortunately, years of abuse went unrecognized by me. I\u2019m doing my best to fix it now. My sister isn\u2019t the issue\u2026 she got dragged into it without knowing my mom hadn\u2019t consulted with us first. And my husband is who said to give her 90 days (this was in early July) because he knows she is broke and wouldn\u2019t have the money to get it out right away and didn\u2019t think it was fair given the circumstances. He and I both talked to her about it and she was fine with it and has most everything gone, now. The only reason this blew up with my mom was because now that my sister has the money to move everything to a storage unit, she asked to borrow my parents truck to take it to the storage place. My mom then asked my sister why she couldn\u2019t just keep it at our place and that\u2019s when she told her she made a deal with me and my husband to have it out in 90 days. That is when she contacted me about it and wanting to know why we needed our garage. In hindsight, from other comments, I can see where I went wrong in telling her it was because my husband is wanting to use it. It\u2019s his workspace so that\u2019s why I addressed it in that manner, not realizing it makes it look like it\u2019s not also me who wants it emptied\u2026 because it is.

My husband also knew that anytime I would stand up to her, I would then endure being harassed by her for days\u2026 weeks\u2026 sometimes even months. So, if he thought something may piss her off, he just wouldn\u2019t do it/bring it up because he didn\u2019t want me to deal with her. For years, he didn\u2019t vocalize his own concerns. He says he thought it was because he was protecting me from my mom\u2019s wrath. It wasn\u2019t until I was getting help that he finally started speaking up about things because I would bring up my own frustrations as I was learning more and more about how enmeshed I was with several abusive people.

She\u2019s gets her crap or you send it to the dump. Her choice.", "Thank you :) I hope to continue to less contact with her so I can prioritize my family.", "You\u2019re not a dumbass. You are being introspective, and you\u2019re trying to figure out what to do. That\u2019s smart. \n\nNow cut those assholes out of your life.", "Talking isn\u2019t the only form of disrespect. Showing up at your home and just putting your sisters shit in the garage? Have you lost your mind? \n\nThere are WAY more ways to disrespect someone by not speaking.", "Why didn\u2019t you throw out your sister\u2019s crap as soon as it showed up? Why didn\u2019t you change the locks then?", "I don\u2019t disagree on that. But, I changed the locks the next day and made our boundaries clear on that front. But he is who stopped me from making my sister get everything out immediately because she (my sister) didn\u2019t know we didn\u2019t agree until after it had happened and he didn\u2019t think it was fair to her\u2026 so I didn\u2019t pursue it until he vocalized to me he was ready for her to move it out."]}
