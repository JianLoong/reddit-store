My mom is very possessive and controlling over all her relationships. Mine, especially. Over the years, I\u2019ve just kind of let her walk all over me and let her get her way in some fashion and move on. She has controlled where we live, what schools we sent our kids to, what vacations we have taken, etc\u2026 the most recent blow up we had was over what church she wanted to go to. She\u2019s a church hopper, I\u2019m not. She wanted to start going to church with us but wanted us to uproot where we were established. I refused. Then, we recently went on a vacation with my in laws (the first time we have ever gone on vacation with them in 15 years\u2026 we\u2019ve gone on vacation every year with my parents for the last 11) and she\u2019s been making snide comments about that since. So, going into this issue, she was already mad at me. \n\nWell, 1.5 years ago, she moved all my sister\u2019s stuff into our house without asking us. My sister was in between homes and she did this while we were at work. She told my sister we could store it in our garage for free since we weren\u2019t really using it. We literally came home one day and couldn\u2019t park in the garage. My husband was irritated but he didn\u2019t want the drama with my mom\u2026 well he didn\u2019t want me to deal with her drama so he let it go. Well, my sister has since moved twice and hasn\u2019t taken any of her stuff. So, my husband told her he wanted it out so he could use his garage. He gave her 90 days and said if it\u2019s not gone by then, he will get rid of it.  Needless to say, it started a huge argument with my mother. She called me and demanded to know why my sister had to get her stuff. I explained my husband has been wanting to use the garage to park the car so he get out the basketball goal for our kids and they can use the driveway. She felt that was unnecessary and we could just take the kids to the park. In the midst of this argument, she told him he could go and eat shit for being a selfish human being. She thinks that he should just keep all my sister\u2019s stuff because she doesn\u2019t want to pay for storage. She thinks that he is being petty for wanting to us his garage. \n\nWhen she did this, I confronted her. I told her it was disrespectful to not only him but to me, his wife. I told her that she is my mother, but he is my husband first and I won\u2019t tolerate her being so vile about him moving forward. She disagrees and is now accusing me of being disrespectful for not agreeing with her and taking my husband\u2019s side.
