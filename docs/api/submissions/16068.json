You\u2019re not religious and are not raising your child religious.  Why would you get her baptized?  Frankly, putting your child through a religious ritual when you dont sincerely believe it strikes me as wrong.", "You cannot get the child baptized in the Catholic Church because neither of the child\u2019s parents intend to raise her in the Catholic faith, and that intention is one of the core requirements. \n\nGranted, some people will be all, \u201cIt\u2019s a harmless lie!\u201d but if religion is THAT IMPORTANT to someone, respecting the tenets of that creed ought to be equally important. If anyone pushes, simply say that even if one tables the \u201cdo it to make Grandma happy\u201d argument, it\u2019s morally unsavory to lie about one\u2019s intentions and you would feel as if you\u2019re making a mockery of someone else\u2019s deeply held tenets of faith.\n\nNTA.", "Lol absolutely NTA. Take it from a lapsed Catholic and veteran of 14 years of faith schooling.", "Definitely NTA. I could imagine some parents - the saints at least - letting this happen to appease the in-laws but I don't think you should...I think it only sets a precedent that she can get her way by just forcing it on you, guilting you, publicly shaming you, etc. and it might not matter RIGHT NOW but as the child grows, if your MIL doesn't respect your boundaries with respect to religion this could get really problematic. \n\nIt's your child; she can join a religion when she is an adult if she so wishes, but for as long as she's a minor it is only logical for you to raise her according to your own religious beliefs which are 'nothing'. I encourage you to keep firm with the inlaws.", "NTA\n\nSounds like MIL needs a little LC time out.\n\nYou've been clear and now you don't need to ever discuss this personal decision again.\n\nSame goes with any other family members that reach out regarding this issue.\n\nThe topic is not up for discussion. \n\n(And consider this, if you cave this time, it will get repeated for any other children, first communion, etc. . .)", "I have a hippy friend who named his son John-Paul.  His catholic mom thought it was for the pope, but it was for two Beatles.  They quarreled over baptism for a long time, until she finally splashed water in the baby and said a quick prayer.  He said he didn\u2019t think it counted.  She said she was desperate.  Sorry there isn\u2019t more of a point to this story, but NTA.", "NTA.  Maybe the best would be to let your kid find out about their own religion when they grow enough of a brain to comprehend them.  But then again, I am not the parent.", "NTA.  Go get the child baptized as a wiccan.  MIL needs to stfu, she is exhibiting the bullying, judgemental, guilting crud behavior that allows the Catholic church to be a bunch of dbags.", "NTA your child, your choice.\n\nMy DH was raised Episcopalian, and I was raised Baptist. After we married,  DH joined the Baptist church and was baptized. \nWhen our eldest son was born, my MIL was unrelenting about having our son baptized as an infant. I told her I  had no problem letting her organize and pay for this at her church. However, our son was going to be raised in the Baptist church.  The priest refused to do it because they considered it as baptism into the Episcopal church. (She ended up doing a self baptism at her home behind my back, but whatever.)\n\nIf her priest becomes aware that you have no intention of raising the child in the church, he may also refuse.", "NTA.  This your child and you are now the parent\u2026how she feels is irrelevant.  Time to go low contact and let people, including your mom, take in the fact that the only power they have is what you allow them to have.", "NTA\n\nBut this truly baffles me, particularly for Catholics.  Baptism welcomes a child into the family of God. It also subjects them to all the rules being in that family requires. And for Catholics there are a lot of rules. The most important one for this discussion is: if you d9nt obey the rules, or sincerely repent breaking them you go to hell. That's it no wiggle room. If you in the family, you obey the rules, or you are cut out.\n\nNow the rules are different if you aren't baptized or raised in the faith. If you aren't a part of the family, weren't taught the rules and are a good and kind person, then you still have a shot of at least not going to hell.\n\nSo why in the world would you insist on baptizing a kid that certainly won't be raised in the faith? You would be condemning them to hell, not saving them.\n\nRef- Catholic Catechism sections on what happens to people uneducated or unexposed to Christ.", "NTA.\n\nMy husband and I were both raised religious, and we are no longer religious. My mother was very adamant about getting my daughter baptized, and I said no. She constantly pushes other religious topics as well. My in-laws are also still somewhat religious (not nearly as much as my parents) and never push any of that on us. I\u2019ll give you one guess which side of the family gets regular phone calls and visits. It\u2019s not my side of the family. \n\nYou get to make decisions on what is best for your child, and if family doesn\u2019t like it, that\u2019s on them. You may also decide that if MIL doesn\u2019t cool it on the religious guilt-trips, she may not get phone calls and visits bc that behavior is abusive. It\u2019s honestly up to her.", "You know the first time she is alone with your daughter she will get her baptised, right? This exact issue has been posted here many times. \n\nNTA. She can practice her religion, but she can't practice it on anybody else.", "NTA. I also grew up Catholic and no longer believe. I found that a lot of the church ceremonies were an opportunity for the congregants to show off more than actually pray on the religious purpose of said ceremony. In this case your MIL is obviously more focused on the baptismal party than the salvation of her grandchild\u2019s soul. If you\u2019re anything like me in my lapsed Catholicism, you probably have mixed feelings about the church; you might find baptism offensive, especially if it\u2019s not done in the spirit of salvation but for the benefit of MIL social status. Don\u2019t do it to appease her, remind her that a show baptism is actually blasphemy.", "NTA. \nMy grandma gave me shit about not getting kiddo baptized. I said someone raised me to not lie and if I stand in church going through a baptism I am essentially lying to God and I have a soul to worry about too. She never said another word--and yes she was very Catholic.", "MIL gets no alone time with your LO. I wouldn't put it past her to take your LO to a church and have her baptized. While the Catholic Church requires parents to be there and give approval for the baptism, MIL would likely lie and say LO is hers, as an adoptee if questioned. Not to mention the unscrupulous priests who would simply go along with it.", "NTA\n\nAsk your MIL if she really wants you and her son to stand in a church and LIE to everyone there, including God and the priest. \n\nThat\u2019s what she\u2019s asking you to do. Baptism is promising to raise the child in the faith so you would be straight up lying. \n\nI would love to hear her answer to that.", "You do know your MIL will try to baptize your daughter if you leave her alone with her, right?\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nYou told her you weren't doing it.\n\nIf she refuses to take no for an answer just stop taking her calls.\n\nWhy hasn't your husband told her to wind her neck in?", "NTA. Offer to get your child baptised at the church of Satan.", "NTA - parents and grandparents need to back off", "NTA. However, don't be surprised if at some point she arranges to get the kid baptized behind your back.", "NTA this is your kid and your decision only. You don't owe grandparents anything when it comes to religious ceremonies.", "no NO a complete sentence", "NTA Your mom is only saying such because she's an enabler who'd rather shut up the sane person (you) as opposed to the more difficult job of putting an asshole in their place. And IMO, it's time to go no contact with her before she baptizes your kid behind your back.", "Oh no you're NTA,  I had this exact same issue with my Catholic mother and stopped her nagging by telling her \"I don't believe in that stuff but if you want an old guy to trickle water on your grandkids face do it yourself\".  I have no idea if she ever did and don't care.", "NTA - during a baptism parents are promising to raise the child in the church. if you and your spouse do not want to baptize your child, everyone else can go kick rocks.", "SHE WAS  BAPTIZED IN THE CHURCH IF SATAN ONE OF THE ORIGINAL SAINTS", "NTA\n\nFrom a religious point of view, I can understand MiL. But it is still totally transgressive. If you seek compromise, there are indigenous communities that baptise children with Catholic ceremonies without them automatically becoming members of the church. In California, for example.\nBut in the end, your child has to find her own way with the faith that seems appropriate to her when she is ready,", "NTA\n\nIf you're looking at having your child be educated in Catholic schools then baptism as a baby is easier than just before enrolment cut off (parish priests will decline as they know that's the only reason). But honestly, if you're both lapsed, I wouldn't do it to appease family.\n\nI'd be going NC with the family and unfollow or deleting them off social media.", "MIL's usually are a pain in the ass, you have no obligation to invite your in-laws to your childs baptism.  Why invite someone you know is only going to criticize you and the entire event?", "YTA - Bucking the trend a bit here but hear me out before downvoting. \n\nFor starters, I am an atheist and this argument has nothing to do with my imaginary friend Jesus and his father who is also himself or something dumb like that.\n\nNow imagine you had a FIL who was super into model trains. I\u2019m talking this guy spends hours at a time building the model train world in his basement, he goes to weekly meetups with other model train enthusiasts and sometimes goes away to model train conventions. You could say the guy is obsessed.\n\nNow say you think model trains are dumb and since they take up so much space they amount to clutter. You don\u2019t like them and you don\u2019t want them in your house. Problem is FIL wants to gift his grandchild a (small) model train set and spend a weekend with them teaching them all about model trains because that is his hobby and he wants to share it with his grandchild. \n\nMIL is being a pain in the ass about it but Catholicism is her hobby. She wants to share that hobby with your kid. Who cares? It\u2019s not like she is demanding you get up early every Sunday and suffer through church services or ordering the kid to undergo a ritual circumcision or get a tribal face tattoo. You got lucky, as imaginary friend in the sky related hobbies go, Catholicism is pretty light weight.\n\nThe woman wants to spend a boring Sunday morning in a church watching a man in a silly looking white robe splash some water on your kid\u2019s forehead and then go back to her house to eat pasta, salad, garlic bread, maybe a meat and cheese board if they have the $$$s to spend and perhaps some meatballs or something if grandma can cook. Who cares? Let grandpa teach the kid about his stupid model trains. If you truly \u201cbelieve in nothing\u201d then you shouldn\u2019t care.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
