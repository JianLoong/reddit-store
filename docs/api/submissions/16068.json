If MIL is that religious it's the thin end of the wedge.\n\nFirst she'll try a baptism, then MIL will be at you for the next step in her cult. (whatever that is, I was raised in some prodestant BS before I walked away) \n\nWould she try a \"secret baptism\"?", "NTA - Apparently your in laws are not Catholic enough to know the rules of the institution they hold so dear. \n\nEvery diocese/archdiocese has their own rules, but these are several rules they generally all agree on that would prevent your child from being baptized. 1) Infant baptism must take place in the parent/guardians\u2019 home parish and if not, then a letter of support from the priest of your home parish should be provided. You do not have a home parish to complete these requirements. 2) the parents/guardians usually have to complete some baptismal prep things - again, you need a home parish for this! 3) the parents/guardians must intend to raise the child in the Catholic faith and you do not. \n\nTell your in-laws that you intend to respect their faith by following the rules that the Roman Catholic Church has very clearly laid out.", "Ummmmmm\n\nOn paper, that is absolutely true. In practice... It kinda depends on the priest, the parish and the family. \n\nClose enough parish, old enough family, good enough connections... Things get 'bent' a bit. Pull the right strings, and away we go.\n\nSo... For instance, let's say there's a really Catholic family, and the head of the family has been involved with the Church for a long time and knows all sorts of folks. His youngest daughter and her husband, after years of trying, adopt a beautiful baby. When the paperwork is finally done, they want to christen the child and they want her eldest sister and her husband to be the godparents. This won't be the first time they're godparents -they've got two other godchildren, all done correctly and in church, even though her sister's husband is Jewish. \n\nTHIS time, the Parish priest will NOT allow a Jewish Godfather, even one who will happily commit to raising the child Catholic, including Catholic schools and going to mass every week if necessary. Nope, not going to happen, go away and don't come back. \n\nPatriarch picks up the phone. He calls HIS parish priest, and then he calls his friend the Monseigneur downtown .Then he calls his old pal the Bishop, but he's out of town, but so sorry about that Mr. M, let me see if the Archbishop is available for you. Archbishop agrees that it is a little unusual, but there is precedent, but he's not going to overrule a priest in his own parish... So why doesn't the family just wander down to the Basilica in, say six weeks? and the Archbishop will be happy to have a priest there do it. \n\nWhich is how my youngest cousin got christened by the Archbishop himself, with a bishop and a flipping Cardinal in attendance, all of whom signed off on a Jewish godfather (turns out the Cardinal grew up down the bloody street from my grandfather, heard his name and thought he'd swing by the service to see if it was the same guy, and say hello). \n\nThere's 'the rules' and then there's the 'rules'.", "NTA. Your in laws may secretly baptize your child the next time they are with her. (Any ordinary person is allowed to baptize another in the Church.) Just pretend you don\u2019t know it happened. It will give them some peace and then you won\u2019t ever have to hear them nagging you (until 2grade when First Holy Communion comes around \ud83d\ude1c).", "NTA. It's you're child and just because she's religious doesn't mean you or your child has to be, and she has no say in whether you baptise your child or not. That's up to you or someday your child.", "NTA.\n\nMy MIL had the same damn arguments, and my husband didn't care but she made it sound like he was on board, so I went with it.\n\nBig mistake! She said it would be a small event, it was her whole side of the family. Which is not small. She acted like we're all part of that religion, her side of the family were welcoming us back to the church, and I had to tell people repeatedly that NO, that's not what was happening. She was proudly telling everyone that we were letting her take the baby to church. Which we also had to correct.\n\nEvery time she got an inch, she'd take a mile and then have a pouty tantrum if there was pushback. \n\nThankfully my husband and I got on the same page (same with the BILs and SILs) and we learned to coordinate around her. But it was still unnecessarily painful.", "I\u2019m an atheist (Baptized Presbyterian) and my wife is a baptized Catholic. She believes, but doesn\u2019t practice. \n\nSince her parents were paying for the wedding and the reception, we took the classes, did the counseling and signed the contract. \n\nThe contract that said that in order to get married in the Catholic Church, we had to raise any of our children as Catholics. \n\nOur daughter\u2019s eleven and is unbaptized and un-communioned.", "As an atheist I fully endorse this - it would be the height of hypocrisy to those of faith to get a child christened for non-religious reasons.", "Actually, baptizing their child Catholic IS committing to mass every Sunday, as well as every holy day of obligation, and ensuring that the child gets all of their religious education and participates in all the sacraments through Confirmation, when the child is responsible from there forward.", "love that, it's cute of your mum to bring the bottle and ask that way.    \n\n\nI was asked to be the godmother to my cousin's baby and I accepted and told them FYI I have to get christened first (our culture everyone is the same religion). And they were like omg no we didn't know you weren't christened, we would never ask that! And I said I didn't mind as it would make my mum happy anyway and I personally don't have beef with the way the religion is generally practised, it's pretty open minded for an old religion, even things they're not supportive of the rhetoric of the priests etc isn't to rant on about it and sermons are always about love thy neighbour and shit.   \nBut the big diff there is NOONE pressured me and I decided to do it just out of the nice connection with my nephew. The priest even basically commented something a bit sarcastic on the day like \"I don't expect to see you for communion next week\" lol", "NTA.\n\nI am Christian. But we aren\u2019t paedobaptists. Because dipping babies in water is strange.\n\nYour MIL needs to learn to respect your boundaries otherwise don\u2019t let her around your kids.", "Absolutely NTA I am not a practicing Jew and my hubs is agnostic though was a Christian. We had our third child a boy after two girls. Even though my parents were not practicing Jews either my dad wanted us to do a Bris. I said absolutely not as my hubs isn\u2019t either and I didn\u2019t want my son to say \u201cwhy do I look different to my dad\u201d. So I told him to mind his business. My dad was very into himself anyway and didn\u2019t really have a relationship with my kids. He only wanted to associate with people that could spend money on him. You do you girl and tell them to fuck off. And go live your best life.", "NTA\n\nThreaten to have the baby baptized/christened/whatevered from a different sect of Christianity if she doesn't stop asking", "NTA\n\nDo not allow your parents/ILs ANY alone overnights with your daughter. \n\nThey WILL take her to be baptized against your wishes. \n\nThis is your daughter.   YOUR decisions are the important ones at this age.  \n\nWhen she is older, she can make that decision for herself.  But now, she is YOUR BABY.\n\nThey are not respectful of your decisions for your child.", "NTA. Tell her that her bizarro belief that babies are born marinated in and stained by sin and that God would send an innocent baby to hell or limbo or whatever because its parents didn\u2019t choose to go through some religious ritual is her problem, not yours, and that the God you don\u2019t believe in would never be so cruel, capricious and unreasonable.\n\nLet her chew on that for a while.\n\nThen block her until she gets a grip.", "NTA. Sounds like it\u2019s time to block someone on social media.", "Also, be aware that if she ever has the kid with her unsupervised, she 100% *will* find a dodgy priest somewhere who will baptize your kid even without parental approval. To her it's a matter of (eternal) life or death, so she will probably stop at nothing to get this to happen.", "I made all my sacraments, but am a non practicing Christian. My husband was only baptized, also non practicing. We had our daughter baptized two years ago and were not required to take any baptism classes.\n\nETA: unsure if we will raise her religiously, we are going to leave the choice up to her, idk why that felt important to add lol", "Seriously. Because I was divorced, and we weren\u2019t willing to wait 18+ months to see if the Catholic church would annul my first marriage (no one involved was Catholic!), we knew we couldn\u2019t have a Catholic wedding. MIL suggest we not tell the priest about my first marriage.\n\nIf the Catholic Church is so important you want us to be married in it, how do you square that to lying to a priest? I\u2019m not Catholic, but I respect organized religion enough to not lie to a priest.", "My dad's very Catholic family was good friends with a priest. He officiated my grandparents' wedding, all of my dad's siblings' weddings, and would eventually go on to officiate several of my cousins' weddings before he passed. My dad was the youngest sibling in his family, and the first since the family came over from Ireland in the 19th century to want to marry a non-Catholic. It's the 1980s, btw. \n\nHis parents don't have an issue, his extended family does have an issue but his mom told them to STFU, but the real issue is: in what kind of church are they going to get married, and who is going to do it. They decide on the priest my dad's family is friends with, in my mom's family's (Protestant) church. The priest is going through the counseling and the contract and gets to that exact clause. My mom says she's sorry, but she can't agree to do that. \n\nThe priest sits and thinks for a moment, and then leans forward and says, \"Well, all right. What if we say-- in the small 'c' catholic church? The universal church?\" and she's like, \"All right, yes, I can agree to that.\" \n\nAnd then he married them in a Lutheran church, and not one of the four of us was raised Catholic.", "No they won't. \n\nThey'll be trying to get the kid baptized behind OP's back for 18 yrs.", "I mean, to be fair to Kavanaugh and Alito, it's *very* possible that their wives just don't want to have sex with them.", "The Catholic Church has zero qualms about having a baby baptized without its parents\u2019 consent and will go so far as to kidnap the child after the so-called baptism. Google Edgardo Mortara.", "Sigh. OK, since I\u2019m guessing my master\u2019s degree in theology and years of tribunal work won\u2019t cut it any more than the Paulists, how about Our Sunday Visitor? \n\nhttps://www.oursundayvisitor.com/are-secret-baptisms-valid/\n\nThere is a difference between validity and liceity\u2014something can be valid without having been licit according to Church law."]}
