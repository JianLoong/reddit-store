He sounds like he was quite obnoxious about it so I feel like you were in your right to correct him.", "NTA. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of Americans just point blank refuse to accept they are American and simply having ancestors from somewhere in Europe doesn\u2019t make them German, Irish, Italian, Scottish etc. \n\nI\u2019m likely going to get downvotes but the amount of American\u2019s I\u2019ve met who have told me that they are also Scottish (I\u2019m Scottish) or Irish (I live in Northern Ireland) is genuinely shocking. They aren\u2019t either. They had ancestors who were but they would have no claim to citizenship, no passport etc. \n\nUnfortunately?

I'm not German but apparently, I can speak better german than this wanna-be.", "NTA \n\nMy great-grandparents were from Spain and I\u2019m as Spanish as Rion Seacrest. You won\u2019t see me claiming as Spanish.\n\nHe\u2019s almost a classic case of the Hillary Baldwin syndrome.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m Italian, born and living in Italy and boy, i lost track of how many Americans i have had to give that speech too in multiple gaming groups.\nLike fr everytime i join one and it comes up i\u2019m Italian there\u2019s always one that gets up doing exactly that kind of things that dude did on your trip.\nIdk why they do it, i can\u2019t understand, but it\u2019s annoying afaik.", "NTA. That guy was a bit too much, comparing himself to someone who actually is from Germany as they are the same thing. Although I will say as someone from the U.S. , I think forming an identity from many meshed backgrounds is really difficult and if you have parents or grandparents that still practice traditions and you were very exposed to that growing up then you may feel as if that is who you are also. I'm definitely not saying having passed down traditions makes someone german but I do think it can be important to empathize with the situation.", "NTA\n\nAmerican here.  It's more common than it should be for Americans, even 4+ generations born in the USA, with a lot of ancestors from a particular country to say they're Irish, German, French, etc instead of saying they are of \\_\\_\\_\\_ descent.  Among the more particularly annoying are 10% or less Irish on St. Patrick's day that get absolutely hammered at the bar or parade.", "NTA. We Americans do have a bad habit of letting our ancestry go to our heads, especially when the culture is not something you actually grew up with. Reminding him that he is an American of German descent is not an AH move, especially when he was being so obnoxious about it.", "NTA Americans need a reality check on this topic.  No, you're not Irish, or German, or whatever other nationality your ancestors came from.  \n\nWhy not just be proud of being a whole new thing, bred of people who took chances and built lives from scratch on a new continent?", "NTA\n\nHe could just say he's an American who's proud of his German heritage. It's common here for Americans to retain loose associations with our ancestors' country of origin while not really being culturally a part of that heritage any longer. My family has awareness of where some German and Norwegian ancestors came from and we have some food traditions but I wouldn't say \"I am German\" even though I took 4 years of German language because I liked education about my ancestors.\n\nYou didn't really need to put him through a test. That was mildly unkind, but he was being annoying. His comment about WWII was wildly inappropriate.", "NTA.\n\nAmericans say \"I'm German/Italian/Irish\" or whatever *in America* to establish a kind of cultural heritage. Outside of the US, though, to say \"I'm German\" usually means that it's your nationality. Fine, he didn't know that you start with, but he should have picked it up and refusing to learn even when it's spelled out makes him TA.", "NTA.\n\nI dream of the day Americans accept themselves as what they are... Americans.", "NTA\n\nThis is something that really annoys a lot of non-American people. Dyeing beer bright green and saying 'Begorrah! Top o'the morning to you!' on the the 17th of March does not make someone Irish any more than someone with a couple of German ancestors way back and drinking beer in September makes you German. \n\nOn the other hand Americans tend to be friendly and try and make connections wherever they go but often manage to stomp all over any cultural sensitivities and are genuinely hurt that people resent Disneyfication.", "Personally, I don't blame you.  Americans are welcome to call themselves German, or Scottish, or Italian, or whatever, while they are in America.  When they are actually in Germany, Scotland, Italy etc, they should dial it back.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong. NTA.  But good luck convincing Americans.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m an American here and this annoys the shit out of me.

Your Irish ancestor immigrated here 150 years and you\u2019ve never even visited Ireland. That doesn\u2019t make you Irish. You\u2019re an American with Irish ancestry.", "NTA and I always find it hilarious when Americans say they are a different nationality when they\u2019re 3rd generation American. It\u2019s right up there with taking a 23andMe and creating your new personality around it. Pure, unadulterated cringe.", "Hahaha realistically ESH, but I sympathise, based on my experience\n\nIn Ireland, thousands of these annoyances land every summer claiming they're Irish because of a great grandparent. \n\nTaking public transport, you get no peace from them telling you this \ud83d\ude02", "NTA-My ancestors that were white were predominantly German. I don\u2019t claim to be German. I\u2019m an American.

Nothing more. But FYI that's a common trait in America as compared to much of the world our history is very short. Also, he was right that America did open a can of whoop-ass on Germany in WW2.", "NTA...no passport, or you don't speak the language? You're not from there. I get where he's coming from because I didn't understand your perspective until I moved to Germany and someone had this exact conversation with me. It was really embarrassing at the time but did sink in. \n\nThis is a really pervasive (and imo toxic) American belief, and although it's also really hard to break someone of that belief if they still live in the American system, I think it's important more people talk about it.", "NTA what a weirdo that guy was", "NTA! Not necessary to crush a strangers dreams especially because you will never see him again..but not TA", "NTA. \n\nI can't stand when my fellow Americans do this. Most of my ancestors were Italians, I enjoy Italian food, but I'm an American. We've been here for well over a century and you have to go back 4 generations before you find someone who wasn't born somewhere in America. I don't get why so many Americans claim things like this guy did", "NAH, I've seen this, too, in many places, and this is the catch. Even though technically he's not a German, his family will have loads and loads of cultural connections to Germany, which have been passed down from his great-grandparents. European people don't understand this, but it's a part of American culture.  Next time something like this happens, say cool, you have German heritage. Because this is really what he's talking about, He knows he's American.", "NAH\n\nHe was trying to be friendly and bond and find a connection to you.\n\nSadly he did it in an annoying way. He is annoying\u2026 but not an asshole.", "I don\u2019t know what to think here. I\u2019m Canadian but can speak English French and Ukrainian and some German Greek Romanian and Polish. I\u2019ve never claimed to be anything than an ethnic Canadian as all my ancestors are immigrants, some married Ukrainian some married Filipino. It doesn\u2019t make me Ukrainian or Filipino. We are all still Canadian. I\u2019m so confused why this would be an issue for him", "NTA.\n\nI dream of the day Americans accept themselves as what they are... Americans.\n\nIt's cool to have heritage but they're Americans.\n\nPeople go out their way to make their distant heritage part of their identity... Well i truly think on some level this is a minor personality disorder. \n\nGoing straight to the war thing as a retort is also an eye roll cringe from me.", "Maybe it\u2019s cos America doesn\u2019t really have any history so they cling to an ancestral nationality to have that sense of heritage and tradition", "NAH\n\nI'm ethnically German, and I think the dude sounds funny. I don't see the issue here, and I think you're being a *little* uptight. Dude likes his German descent and German culture (as much as he's been exposed to). As far as this goes, it seems fine. It he was a wehreboo I would have a completely different position. \n\nI think this is the question around cultural appropriation--lots of cultures take \"using\" their culture differently--Japanese people love it when other cultures take part in Japanese culture, or wear Japanese clothing. Similar for many Indians and South/Latin Americans. If its done in good faith, and without looking down on the culture, I don't see the problem. \n\nAlso all the Europeans I'm sure would laugh at that American dude--let him be a joke.", "NTA\n\nIt's totally an american thing.  \nThey'll have parents, or grandparents from X country, and they'll make it their entire personnality. \n\nLike they have people born in the US not speaking a word of spanish call themselves \"latinas\", they'll make a whole deal about racism and stereotypes but will absolutely assume foreign heritage based on skin color.  \n\n\nIdk I guess just being american is not enough, you have to be exotic and quirky.", "As an American, I can sympathize with him. This country is a ton of different cultures all packed into one, so one's race and identity is really important to us. I'm speaking as someone who was adopted as a baby and raised in the states. I am American, but I am also Vietnamese. I may not know everything about the culture, nor do I even know the language, but it's a sensitive topic because it's who I am.\n\nNow, it sounds to me like this guy took German culture and ran with it without really knowing or studying up on what goes on in Germany. I wouldn't say YTA, you're just annoyed by some American trying to act like he knows all about your culture when he doesn't.", "I think what you may be dealing with is a difference in culture. I\u2019m American and I say that I\u2019m French, Polish, Portuguese, Mexican, Italian, and a bunch of other things I can\u2019t name off the top of my head. I don\u2019t, however, necessarily spout all this information out in casual conversation but I do loosely connect myself due to familial connections from the past and the present. It\u2019s incredible learning about past ancestors and when we do we, at the very least I, feel a connection to the place of my ancestry. \nWe may not have stepped foot in these countries but they hold meaning to us.\n\nHere\u2019s an example, a relative of mine lived in Poland when the Nazi\u2019s invaded the country. While walking around not far outside the city/ town limits he came across an abandoned cattle car filled with Jewish people. He observed the scene for awhile to check if any one was coming before attempting to free them. He was unable to because of the lock mechanism in place but promised to come back later that night with tools to free them.\n\nThat night my relative made the mistake of telling a friend his plans. The Gestapo invaded his home while my relative was making preparations. He was sent to Dachau and lived to see liberation. It\u2019s believed that he died shortly after when some of the liberators unknowingly gave him food his body was unable to handle during malnutrition.\n\nI feel connected to my Polish roots partially due to the bravery of this relative I know that I am not from Poland but I identify as Polish because of the ancestral history.", "You\u2019re an understandable AH haha - there aren\u2019t many Germans who live in America so he was probably really happy to meet some Germans and tried to connect with you guys. Dude might have been a little too happy to share his identity with you though lol", "I was thinking I would go with Y-T-A, because it sounded like you were overreacting and didn't understand.\n\nI was born in the U.S., but I say I'm Italian. It's simply how we would say we're Italian by descent. Any American speaking to me would understand that me saying \"I'm Italian\" means I'm Italian by descent.\n\nBut on the other hand, this guy was being annoying.\n\nComparing him to my situation again, I wouldn't go on and on about Italian culture, because I know very little about it. I don't know Italian cuisine or other aspects of Italian culture and I don't speak the language.\n\nBut on the other hand, I wouldn't pretend to be an authority on Italian culture, unlike this friend of yours, who seems to want to pass himself off as an authority on all there is to know about Germany.\n\nYou put him in his place. You were polite, but firm. And he, on the other hand, was rude in his response.\n\nNTA", "NTA - and what a rude fuck he was. Also Hitler go a lot of advice on how to genocide from how the US militia murderd native Americans inc are he goes that route", "YTA\n\nThere's no singular definition of what German is. And he is, apparently, ethnically German. \n\nHe's been raised with traditions that WERE German. They are decidedly not the standard WASP American ones. So it's reductive to just declare him American if he wasn't raised as such. \n\nIt's a big part of his identity bc he was taught to value it. \n\nWhen you value something, you don't necessarily know everything about it. And maybe you laugh at what you thought it was at the outset. \n\nAnyhow. Yeah he was annoying but you were an A.", "He\u2019s not living in a delusion. He is German. He\u2019s just not from Germany. His grandparents taught him things that he considered German (which was mostly Americanized German). So they may have said \u201chere have a hot dog with sauerkraut just like Germans.\u201d His passport says American but his heritage is German. And yeah the grandparents probably didn\u2019t encourage German in the home when they had kids bc they were coming off of WW2 and probably wanted to hide that as they would have been seen in a negative light just bc of their heritage at that time frame. (Wrong but probably) You could have taken that moment to teach him a few things about his heritage that you feel are important. Instead you want to bash him.", "ESH American guy isn\u2019t wrong that he is German, but he is wrong about the extent he is German next to someone from Germany, who can speak German and knows German culture. I feel like checking him a little isn\u2019t wrong, but I think he was trying to socialize and take pride in his heritage. Maybe he has some things wrong, but in my view it\u2019s pretty understandable he wants to cling to something German.", "That guy sounds annoying, but soft YTA.

This is *especially* true of white Americans and, I would venture to say, seems to get more extreme with white cishet male Americans. Which is not to imply it always works that way. Nevertheless, I think what a European sometimes has is something Americans sometimes don't: an almost subconscious sense of their roots and ancestry tied to the region where their family is from. In America it's much more common to move to another state. Families end up thousands of miles apart from each other. You often miss out on seeing each generation through all stages of life in your family. Your town or city may lack a sense of history, or it's history is only going to go back 75 -100 years. All this adds up to someone who looks around as they mature and doesn't see much to tell them who they are. Some will choose to define themselves with other identity categories; that's why I think it's less prevalent among women, LGBTQIA people, people of color, and so on. A cishet white dude has to keep looking. Some go MAGA. Some get into a sports team like their life depends on it. And some look at their ancestry. Being German (or another nationality) becomes a huge part of their identity, because there's an incredible richness to being German that they may not see in their surroundings (I'm thinking of areas where all the old buildings have been destroyed and replaced with strip malls, for example). Is it delusional? I don't know. They aren't German the way OP is German, certainly. But I don't see anything all that bad about an American embracing the identity of their ancestors in order to create a sense of identity and richness in a life that may be lacking it. I'm half French living in rural France after several decades in California and Hawaii, though, so my perspective is colored by that. I'd certainly rather an American be super into the idea of their French ancestry and make that their whole identity rather than that they go MAGA or Qanon or something else that's going to end up harming people if taken too far.

You may be descended from germans, but you are not German. \n\nI'm 33. I come from a more liberal area of the country. I was taught all growing up that it's important to know that we are from different places, we have different languages that we spoke, different skin colors, different ways of behaving in such things, but we are all Americans. We were taught to celebrate the differences that we had, and to embrace them. America was the 'melting pot' where all of the different cultures and such things of the world came together, we are different and that is okay. \n\nThen there are other places in the country where they teach that slavery was to the benefit of the Africans that were brought here.\n\nThe standards of education for the United States are kind of terrible.", "The real problem is these people refuse to acknowledge they experienced the Americanized version of whatever (in this case German) culture.

Also, it's usually like their great great grandparent that came here and they know nothing of what happened before. \n\nHalf of my family is of German heritage coming here just before WWII, and they bestowed some German slang on us. Of course, it's slang from pre WWII. So when I joked with my German exchange student friend about it, she had a great laugh hearing me speak like her grandma.

We note our ancestory, and are told that\u2019s not our culture because we\u2019re American, but then we\u2019re told Americans have no culture since it\u2019s just a mishmash of other cultures, so you say \u201coh well I\u2019m Irish\u201d but no, you\u2019re not Irish, you\u2019re American, but Americans have no culture and on and on.", "I can definitely see how that gets annoying.

Some people belong to families whose ancestors immigrated in pretty devastating circumstances, and those circumstances and the cultural heritage associated with it becomes a significant part of their family identity. The Irish in America are a good example of this. Also quite a few German Americans. Or Scottish Americans whose ancestors were impacted by the Highland clearances. So I don't think Americans who cling to the cultural heritage associated with their ancestors are trying to be disrespectful. That heritage has just become ingrained in their family identity over generations.", "I am an American and I agree. It is cazy here.

My paternal grandmother moved to America when she was 17, she met and married my Austrian Jewish grandfather who forbade her to teach my dad and his brother any Italian. All I have left is her recipes and her life story.\n\nThere is trauma related to immigration, especially to America since most people who came here were looking for a better life. If you have the chance then I\u2019d take a glance at The Oath immigrants are required to take in order to legally immigrate to the United States- it all, but forced people to leave behind everything they\u2019ve ever known.

I have my grandmother\u2019s sauce recipe, I can make pasta from scratch\u2026 food is often the only daily reminder most Americans have that their family came from immigrants. This country is so young that most people can trace back their heritage to someone they knew who immigrated.\n\nThe size of this country also influences a lot.

Just say you're German American if you feel that connected to your ancestry.", "Absolutely, I'm Scottish and of Danish decent, I am going to Denmark for the first time in October and I won't be telling them I am Danish \ud83d\ude48 amd I am proud of my viking heritage and I will be hunting down a frikadella nom nom", "You'd best be perfect when you visit other countries", "That depends\u2026 were my parents shunned from the community in Florida and treated differently, denied jobs etc and forced to all live in one run down area of the city when they moved to Florida?", "It's not a matter of misinterpretation. OP knew what the guy meant. We all know what Americans mean when you say stuff like that. What you don't get is how idiotic that sounds to us. You're not Italian or German or whatever, you're American. And it's hell annoying.", "I read it all. It's irrelevant to what happened here. Why should we be so understanding of the American perspective rather than the guy be understanding of how insulting it is to us, when he was literally in Spain.\n\nWhen in Rome.", "I can put it into words easily, they are dumb, thats it , was easy .", "That's the cognitive dissonance taking hold in the American.", "yes the cultural context of where they are and who they are saying it to.  The context they are completely missing.", "Maybe you should head to the corner and think about why it's not actually relevant", "I\u2019m from the US and I try to avoid that.", "Yeah, I come across so much hostility about this. Like, trust me people of Europe: You guys have cultural misunderstandings when you come here, too.", "Yes it does when you were explain how things works in a place and you keep instisting on something, thats not misunderstanding anymore", "Also when they are told, when not in North America, that they are not, then the standard thing to do would be to say sorry, explain what you meant and move on - not double down", "Others have already said it. It is the difference between being self-centred or open minded. He was almost insisting he was more German than the Germans.\n\nI am Dutch and we had the misfortune of having Pete Hoekstra as the US Ambassador to the Netherlands. He was born in the Netherlands to Dutch parents, but culturally he couldn\u2019t be further apart. He is a Republican, conservative and Reformed Michigander and made that all too clear in the public appearances in which he tried to lecture us into being better people. He probably felt that need because the Dutch are the most atheistic nation of Western Europe. \n\nDutch and German culture have moved on, time for the Dutch/German-Americans/Canadians to do the same. I don\u2019t care what \u2018dialect\u2019 Northern Americans speak with one another, we don\u2019t understand and we don\u2019t appreciate you waltzing in and thinking you are one of us without proper introductions.", "In other words, he was insensitive to the fact that he is not the same as a native German. Stop being an apologist for this guy. He was wrong and acted embarassingly.", "> Also seems worth pointing out that it's ironic in a thread where many people are saying it's weird for white Americans to specify what country their ancestors came from to then say it's racist to not differentiate black Americans by country of origin.\n\nI say the entire system is racist and wrong, just point out how ridiculous the US system especially when pointing out African Americans as a mono-culture heritage.", "I disagree with you in that regard that I am not in a position to talk about this issue.\n\nThe US rethoric regarding ethnicity and race mirrors the unscientific race theory of the 19th century, which was the foundation for the ideology of the Nazi Party and the third Reich and was the reasoning behind all the horrible acts that was committed by them.\n\nThe reason why I have very strong opinions on this sociatal approach and why I am so strongly against the notion \"that is who we are\" is because that was literally who WE were and we know how it can end because of the ideology it supports.", "as I've said in another comment, I actually think US fascination with their heritage is understandable. where it becomes a problem is in situations like this, where for some reason the person of German heritage decided to get in a pissing match with an actual German person about who is the most German.\n\nGerman no longer looks like a real word, I've typed it too many times.", "People claiming to be something they're not are the ones being weird about it. More so when they claim to do it better.", "Ahahha what?! I dont think so. Lol.", " You just wanted to take this piss out of him, because you were tipsy. \n\nFor the record Saurkraut on hotdogs is a German influence; no one said it's a German dish. A German immigrant in NYC created it in the 1800's.\n\nThere is such a thing as German American culture. Because there is also Irish American culture and Italian American culture. \n\n So that makes you ignorant of American culture, just as he was ignorant of German culture.", ">Although I loved your entire comment, \n\nThank you!\n\n>I'm just here to point out that London is not the city/town that founded many British-Indian dishes or tikka masala - it is said to have been invented in Glasgow, but definitely at least the north of England for many British-Indian dishes.\n\nOh my! oops!\n\nI'll go back and fix it.\n\n>I don't wanna be here giving London credit when it's undue.\r\n\nCompletely understandable. I apologize for my mistake.", "I mean going to another country and lecturing someone from another country about how you're totally from the same country despite the fact they're not and don't even speak the language is a low low bar my friend.\n\nIn the post the guy claimed to be German, know the culture and food despite everything he mentioned being nonsense to the actual German.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with tracing family roots, being proud of what that member taught you and passing their traditions down but that doesn't make it a part of that country or that culture. It's a family tradition at that point.", "we tend not to claim to live in the country when we are visiting it for a short while.", "Stop being so dense. If someone's entire family history is Italian but they were born in the United States, their background (ethnicity) is Italian. To deny they are ethnically Italian is just ignorant.\n\nPlease learn the distinction between ethnicity and nationality. It only sounds idiotic to ignorant people like you who don't understand that ethnicity is what matters to the majority of people.", "So, you know what it's actually intended to mean, but you find it annoying because of anther meaning which isn't intended? I feel like you're looking for a reason to be annoyed.", "American here, it sounds idiotic to me too. People constantly act like they\u2019re italian or German or Greek but know nothing about the language or culture or actual people living there", "I'm not asking you to be understanding, I'm explaining to you that you misunderstand a very common speaking pattern in a different dialect of the English language while admitting that the American does not have a good grasp of why he does the things he does.", "Yeah, I agree, but most Americans are rude, pigheaded, don't know how to explain themselves, and rarely consider how others may approach or understand a situation, also this was at a bar.", "You are wrong. As an Italian person, Spanish is very easy to understand. I won't get all of it but most, because the languages are very similar. Don't preach about stuff you know nothing about.", "As I've said from the start: I'm 100% aware of german-american culture.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that this man's idea of GERMAN culture made it very clear that even his \"german-american\" was severely lacking. Especially because his only actual connection to germany was ONE great grandfather. That is 4 generations away from him.\n\nYes yes i've already said Sauerkraut is a very german thing, but the point is that hot dogs are not. I cannot take guacamole and dumb it into a bowl of rice noodles and say I invented a new mexican dish or expect any mexican to suddenly know this.\n\nHe was not presenting his culture as german american but as fully german", "The reason is simple: it's called being self centered. If you adopt a way of speaking that will likely bring confusion or even disrespect when outside of your country, and you still fail to understand why you shouldn't, is because you have come to the very wrong assumption that \"your way\" should just be common knowledge.", "I'm explaining to you that we don't misunderstand. We find it insulting and while we might have to adapt to the fact that it's a cultural norm if we were there it is not acceptable to keep doing it when you are not.", "Amo sono italiana anch\u2019io ma non credo che sarei in grado di comprendere un\u2019intera conversazione in spagnolo se non lo avessi studiato, ti pare?", "The same reason the German guy thought the American, the American guy thought the German would understand him.\n\nThe whole point of a misunderstanding is that neither people understand what the other is saying. \n\nWe didn't \"adopt\" this way of speaking, this is how it's always been in North America. It's been hundreds of years of this, most people can't explain why they do it. \n\nI'm not saying it should be common knowledge, I'm explaining it to you know so you know where it's coming from."]}
