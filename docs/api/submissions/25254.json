He sounds like he was quite obnoxious about it so I feel like you were in your right to correct him.", "NTA. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of Americans just point blank refuse to accept they are American and simply having ancestors from somewhere in Europe doesn\u2019t make them German, Irish, Italian, Scottish etc. \n\nI\u2019m likely going to get downvotes but the amount of American\u2019s I\u2019ve met who have told me that they are also Scottish (I\u2019m Scottish) or Irish (I live in Northern Ireland) is genuinely shocking. They aren\u2019t either. They had ancestors who were but they would have no claim to citizenship, no passport etc. \n\nUnfortunately?

I'm not German but apparently, I can speak better german than this wanna-be.", "NTA \n\nMy great-grandparents were from Spain and I\u2019m as Spanish as Rion Seacrest. You won\u2019t see me claiming as Spanish.\n\nHe\u2019s almost a classic case of the Hillary Baldwin syndrome.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m Italian, born and living in Italy and boy, i lost track of how many Americans i have had to give that speech too in multiple gaming groups.\nLike fr everytime i join one and it comes up i\u2019m Italian there\u2019s always one that gets up doing exactly that kind of things that dude did on your trip.\nIdk why they do it, i can\u2019t understand, but it\u2019s annoying afaik.", "NTA. That guy was a bit too much, comparing himself to someone who actually is from Germany as they are the same thing. Although I will say as someone from the U.S. , I think forming an identity from many meshed backgrounds is really difficult and if you have parents or grandparents that still practice traditions and you were very exposed to that growing up then you may feel as if that is who you are also. I'm definitely not saying having passed down traditions makes someone german but I do think it can be important to empathize with the situation.", "NTA\n\nAmerican here.  It's more common than it should be for Americans, even 4+ generations born in the USA, with a lot of ancestors from a particular country to say they're Irish, German, French, etc instead of saying they are of \\_\\_\\_\\_ descent.  Among the more particularly annoying are 10% or less Irish on St. Patrick's day that get absolutely hammered at the bar or parade.", "NTA. We Americans do have a bad habit of letting our ancestry go to our heads, especially when the culture is not something you actually grew up with. Reminding him that he is an American of German descent is not an AH move, especially when he was being so obnoxious about it.", "NTA Americans need a reality check on this topic.  No, you're not Irish, or German, or whatever other nationality your ancestors came from.  \n\nWhy not just be proud of being a whole new thing, bred of people who took chances and built lives from scratch on a new continent?", "NTA\n\nHe could just say he's an American who's proud of his German heritage. It's common here for Americans to retain loose associations with our ancestors' country of origin while not really being culturally a part of that heritage any longer. My family has awareness of where some German and Norwegian ancestors came from and we have some food traditions but I wouldn't say \"I am German\" even though I took 4 years of German language because I liked education about my ancestors.\n\nYou didn't really need to put him through a test. That was mildly unkind, but he was being annoying. His comment about WWII was wildly inappropriate.", "NTA.\n\nAmericans say \"I'm German/Italian/Irish\" or whatever *in America* to establish a kind of cultural heritage. Outside of the US, though, to say \"I'm German\" usually means that it's your nationality. Fine, he didn't know that you start with, but he should have picked it up and refusing to learn even when it's spelled out makes him TA.", "NTA.\n\nI dream of the day Americans accept themselves as what they are... Americans.", "NTA\n\nThis is something that really annoys a lot of non-American people. Dyeing beer bright green and saying 'Begorrah! Top o'the morning to you!' on the the 17th of March does not make someone Irish any more than someone with a couple of German ancestors way back and drinking beer in September makes you German. \n\nOn the other hand Americans tend to be friendly and try and make connections wherever they go but often manage to stomp all over any cultural sensitivities and are genuinely hurt that people resent Disneyfication.", "Personally, I don't blame you.  Americans are welcome to call themselves German, or Scottish, or Italian, or whatever, while they are in America.  When they are actually in Germany, Scotland, Italy etc, they should dial it back.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong. NTA.  But good luck convincing Americans.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m an American here and this annoys the shit out of me.

Your Irish ancestor immigrated here 150 years and you\u2019ve never even visited Ireland. That doesn\u2019t make you Irish. You\u2019re an American with Irish ancestry.", "NTA and I always find it hilarious when Americans say they are a different nationality when they\u2019re 3rd generation American. It\u2019s right up there with taking a 23andMe and creating your new personality around it. Pure, unadulterated cringe.", "Hahaha realistically ESH, but I sympathise, based on my experience\n\nIn Ireland, thousands of these annoyances land every summer claiming they're Irish because of a great grandparent. \n\nTaking public transport, you get no peace from them telling you this \ud83d\ude02", "NTA-My ancestors that were white were predominantly German. I don\u2019t claim to be German. I\u2019m an American.

Nothing more. But FYI that's a common trait in America as compared to much of the world our history is very short. Also, he was right that America did open a can of whoop-ass on Germany in WW2.", "NTA...no passport, or you don't speak the language? You're not from there. I get where he's coming from because I didn't understand your perspective until I moved to Germany and someone had this exact conversation with me. It was really embarrassing at the time but did sink in. \n\nThis is a really pervasive (and imo toxic) American belief, and although it's also really hard to break someone of that belief if they still live in the American system, I think it's important more people talk about it.", "NTA what a weirdo that guy was", "NTA! Not necessary to crush a strangers dreams especially because you will never see him again..but not TA", "NTA. \n\nI can't stand when my fellow Americans do this. Most of my ancestors were Italians, I enjoy Italian food, but I'm an American. We've been here for well over a century and you have to go back 4 generations before you find someone who wasn't born somewhere in America. I don't get why so many Americans claim things like this guy did", "NAH, I've seen this, too, in many places, and this is the catch. Even though technically he's not a German, his family will have loads and loads of cultural connections to Germany, which have been passed down from his great-grandparents. European people don't understand this, but it's a part of American culture.  Next time something like this happens, say cool, you have German heritage. Because this is really what he's talking about, He knows he's American.", "NAH\n\nHe was trying to be friendly and bond and find a connection to you.\n\nSadly he did it in an annoying way. He is annoying\u2026 but not an asshole.", "I don\u2019t know what to think here. I\u2019m Canadian but can speak English French and Ukrainian and some German Greek Romanian and Polish. I\u2019ve never claimed to be anything than an ethnic Canadian as all my ancestors are immigrants, some married Ukrainian some married Filipino. It doesn\u2019t make me Ukrainian or Filipino. We are all still Canadian. I\u2019m so confused why this would be an issue for him", "NTA.\n\nI dream of the day Americans accept themselves as what they are... Americans.\n\nIt's cool to have heritage but they're Americans.\n\nPeople go out their way to make their distant heritage part of their identity... Well i truly think on some level this is a minor personality disorder. \n\nGoing straight to the war thing as a retort is also an eye roll cringe from me.", "Maybe it\u2019s cos America doesn\u2019t really have any history so they cling to an ancestral nationality to have that sense of heritage and tradition", "NAH\n\nI'm ethnically German, and I think the dude sounds funny. I don't see the issue here, and I think you're being a *little* uptight. Dude likes his German descent and German culture (as much as he's been exposed to). As far as this goes, it seems fine. It he was a wehreboo I would have a completely different position. \n\nI think this is the question around cultural appropriation--lots of cultures take \"using\" their culture differently--Japanese people love it when other cultures take part in Japanese culture, or wear Japanese clothing. Similar for many Indians and South/Latin Americans. If its done in good faith, and without looking down on the culture, I don't see the problem. \n\nAlso all the Europeans I'm sure would laugh at that American dude--let him be a joke.", "NTA\n\nIt's totally an american thing.  \nThey'll have parents, or grandparents from X country, and they'll make it their entire personnality. \n\nLike they have people born in the US not speaking a word of spanish call themselves \"latinas\", they'll make a whole deal about racism and stereotypes but will absolutely assume foreign heritage based on skin color.  \n\n\nIdk I guess just being american is not enough, you have to be exotic and quirky.", "As an American, I can sympathize with him. This country is a ton of different cultures all packed into one, so one's race and identity is really important to us. I'm speaking as someone who was adopted as a baby and raised in the states. I am American, but I am also Vietnamese. I may not know everything about the culture, nor do I even know the language, but it's a sensitive topic because it's who I am.\n\nNow, it sounds to me like this guy took German culture and ran with it without really knowing or studying up on what goes on in Germany. I wouldn't say YTA, you're just annoyed by some American trying to act like he knows all about your culture when he doesn't.", "I think what you may be dealing with is a difference in culture. I\u2019m American and I say that I\u2019m French, Polish, Portuguese, Mexican, Italian, and a bunch of other things I can\u2019t name off the top of my head. I don\u2019t, however, necessarily spout all this information out in casual conversation but I do loosely connect myself due to familial connections from the past and the present. It\u2019s incredible learning about past ancestors and when we do we, at the very least I, feel a connection to the place of my ancestry. \nWe may not have stepped foot in these countries but they hold meaning to us.\n\nHere\u2019s an example, a relative of mine lived in Poland when the Nazi\u2019s invaded the country. While walking around not far outside the city/ town limits he came across an abandoned cattle car filled with Jewish people. He observed the scene for awhile to check if any one was coming before attempting to free them. He was unable to because of the lock mechanism in place but promised to come back later that night with tools to free them.\n\nThat night my relative made the mistake of telling a friend his plans. The Gestapo invaded his home while my relative was making preparations. He was sent to Dachau and lived to see liberation. It\u2019s believed that he died shortly after when some of the liberators unknowingly gave him food his body was unable to handle during malnutrition.\n\nI feel connected to my Polish roots partially due to the bravery of this relative I know that I am not from Poland but I identify as Polish because of the ancestral history.", "You\u2019re an understandable AH haha - there aren\u2019t many Germans who live in America so he was probably really happy to meet some Germans and tried to connect with you guys. Dude might have been a little too happy to share his identity with you though lol", "I was thinking I would go with Y-T-A, because it sounded like you were overreacting and didn't understand.\n\nI was born in the U.S., but I say I'm Italian. It's simply how we would say we're Italian by descent. Any American speaking to me would understand that me saying \"I'm Italian\" means I'm Italian by descent.\n\nBut on the other hand, this guy was being annoying.\n\nComparing him to my situation again, I wouldn't go on and on about Italian culture, because I know very little about it. I don't know Italian cuisine or other aspects of Italian culture and I don't speak the language.\n\nBut on the other hand, I wouldn't pretend to be an authority on Italian culture, unlike this friend of yours, who seems to want to pass himself off as an authority on all there is to know about Germany.\n\nYou put him in his place. You were polite, but firm. And he, on the other hand, was rude in his response.\n\nNTA", "NTA - and what a rude fuck he was. Also Hitler go a lot of advice on how to genocide from how the US militia murderd native Americans inc are he goes that route", "YTA\n\nThere's no singular definition of what German is. And he is, apparently, ethnically German. \n\nHe's been raised with traditions that WERE German. They are decidedly not the standard WASP American ones. So it's reductive to just declare him American if he wasn't raised as such. \n\nIt's a big part of his identity bc he was taught to value it. \n\nWhen you value something, you don't necessarily know everything about it. And maybe you laugh at what you thought it was at the outset. \n\nAnyhow. Yeah he was annoying but you were an A.", "He\u2019s not living in a delusion. He is German. He\u2019s just not from Germany. His grandparents taught him things that he considered German (which was mostly Americanized German). So they may have said \u201chere have a hot dog with sauerkraut just like Germans.\u201d His passport says American but his heritage is German. And yeah the grandparents probably didn\u2019t encourage German in the home when they had kids bc they were coming off of WW2 and probably wanted to hide that as they would have been seen in a negative light just bc of their heritage at that time frame. (Wrong but probably) You could have taken that moment to teach him a few things about his heritage that you feel are important. Instead you want to bash him.", "ESH American guy isn\u2019t wrong that he is German, but he is wrong about the extent he is German next to someone from Germany, who can speak German and knows German culture. I feel like checking him a little isn\u2019t wrong, but I think he was trying to socialize and take pride in his heritage. Maybe he has some things wrong, but in my view it\u2019s pretty understandable he wants to cling to something German.", "That guy sounds annoying, but soft YTA.

But being multi-racial has a lot of issues that get downplayed by people who pretend to have some ethnic upbringing when they don't.\n\nIt makes talking about social issues really difficult, because they supposedly \"experience it\" too, but their experience is limited to like their 1% Irish where they go drinking once a year or maybe have 1 ginger person in the family.
