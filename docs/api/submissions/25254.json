He sounds like he was quite obnoxious about it so I feel like you were in your right to correct him.", "NTA. I\u2019ve noticed a lot of Americans just point blank refuse to accept they are American and simply having ancestors from somewhere in Europe doesn\u2019t make them German, Irish, Italian, Scottish etc. \n\nI\u2019m likely going to get downvotes but the amount of American\u2019s I\u2019ve met who have told me that they are also Scottish (I\u2019m Scottish) or Irish (I live in Northern Ireland) is genuinely shocking. They aren\u2019t either. They had ancestors who were but they would have no claim to citizenship, no passport etc. \n\nUnfortunately? The people who say these types of things generally don\u2019t realise what they are saying and how they are being disrespectful.", "NTA at all\n\nAmericans can be so annoying with their \"I'm 1% irish/german/whatever\". No one cares, you're American. Period. Stop trying to pretend to be something other than what you are.\n\nYou lasted longer than I would have. I'm not German but apparently, I can speak better german than this wanna-be.", "NTA \n\nMy great-grandparents were from Spain and I\u2019m as Spanish as Rion Seacrest. You won\u2019t see me claiming as Spanish.\n\nHe\u2019s almost a classic case of the Hillary Baldwin syndrome.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m Italian, born and living in Italy and boy, i lost track of how many Americans i have had to give that speech too in multiple gaming groups.\nLike fr everytime i join one and it comes up i\u2019m Italian there\u2019s always one that gets up doing exactly that kind of things that dude did on your trip.\nIdk why they do it, i can\u2019t understand, but it\u2019s annoying afaik.", "NTA. That guy was a bit too much, comparing himself to someone who actually is from Germany as they are the same thing. Although I will say as someone from the U.S. , I think forming an identity from many meshed backgrounds is really difficult and if you have parents or grandparents that still practice traditions and you were very exposed to that growing up then you may feel as if that is who you are also. I'm definitely not saying having passed down traditions makes someone german but I do think it can be important to empathize with the situation.", "NTA\n\nAmerican here.  It's more common than it should be for Americans, even 4+ generations born in the USA, with a lot of ancestors from a particular country to say they're Irish, German, French, etc instead of saying they are of \\_\\_\\_\\_ descent.  Among the more particularly annoying are 10% or less Irish on St. Patrick's day that get absolutely hammered at the bar or parade.", "NTA. We Americans do have a bad habit of letting our ancestry go to our heads, especially when the culture is not something you actually grew up with. Reminding him that he is an American of German descent is not an AH move, especially when he was being so obnoxious about it.", "NTA Americans need a reality check on this topic.  No, you're not Irish, or German, or whatever other nationality your ancestors came from.  \n\nWhy not just be proud of being a whole new thing, bred of people who took chances and built lives from scratch on a new continent?", "NTA\n\nHe could just say he's an American who's proud of his German heritage. It's common here for Americans to retain loose associations with our ancestors' country of origin while not really being culturally a part of that heritage any longer. My family has awareness of where some German and Norwegian ancestors came from and we have some food traditions but I wouldn't say \"I am German\" even though I took 4 years of German language because I liked education about my ancestors.\n\nYou didn't really need to put him through a test. That was mildly unkind, but he was being annoying. His comment about WWII was wildly inappropriate.", "NTA.\n\nAmericans say \"I'm German/Italian/Irish\" or whatever *in America* to establish a kind of cultural heritage. Outside of the US, though, to say \"I'm German\" usually means that it's your nationality. Fine, he didn't know that you start with, but he should have picked it up and refusing to learn even when it's spelled out makes him TA.", "NTA.\n\nI dream of the day Americans accept themselves as what they are... Americans.", "NTA\n\nThis is something that really annoys a lot of non-American people. Dyeing beer bright green and saying 'Begorrah! Top o'the morning to you!' on the the 17th of March does not make someone Irish any more than someone with a couple of German ancestors way back and drinking beer in September makes you German. \n\nOn the other hand Americans tend to be friendly and try and make connections wherever they go but often manage to stomp all over any cultural sensitivities and are genuinely hurt that people resent Disneyfication.", "Personally, I don't blame you.  Americans are welcome to call themselves German, or Scottish, or Italian, or whatever, while they are in America.  When they are actually in Germany, Scotland, Italy etc, they should dial it back.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong. NTA.  But good luck convincing Americans.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m an American here and this annoys the shit out of me.

Your Irish ancestor immigrated here 150 years and you\u2019ve never even visited Ireland. That doesn\u2019t make you Irish. You\u2019re an American with Irish ancestry.", "NTA and I always find it hilarious when Americans say they are a different nationality when they\u2019re 3rd generation American. It\u2019s right up there with taking a 23andMe and creating your new personality around it. Pure, unadulterated cringe.", "Hahaha realistically ESH, but I sympathise, based on my experience\n\nIn Ireland, thousands of these annoyances land every summer claiming they're Irish because of a great grandparent. \n\nTaking public transport, you get no peace from them telling you this \ud83d\ude02", "NTA-My ancestors that were white were predominantly German. I don\u2019t claim to be German. I\u2019m an American. I\u2019ll tell you my ancestors were German and my brother in law is German but me I\u2019d never claim it as my own background because it isn\u2019t.", "NTA he is an american of German decent. Nothing more. But FYI that's a common trait in America as compared to much of the world our history is very short. Also, he was right that America did open a can of whoop-ass on Germany in WW2.", "NTA...no passport, or you don't speak the language? You're not from there. I get where he's coming from because I didn't understand your perspective until I moved to Germany and someone had this exact conversation with me. It was really embarrassing at the time but did sink in. \n\nThis is a really pervasive (and imo toxic) American belief, and although it's also really hard to break someone of that belief if they still live in the American system, I think it's important more people talk about it.", "NTA what a weirdo that guy was", "NTA! Not necessary to crush a strangers dreams especially because you will never see him again..but not TA", "NTA. \n\nI can't stand when my fellow Americans do this. Most of my ancestors were Italians, I enjoy Italian food, but I'm an American. We've been here for well over a century and you have to go back 4 generations before you find someone who wasn't born somewhere in America. I don't get why so many Americans claim things like this guy did", "NAH, I've seen this, too, in many places, and this is the catch. Even though technically he's not a German, his family will have loads and loads of cultural connections to Germany, which have been passed down from his great-grandparents. European people don't understand this, but it's a part of American culture.  Next time something like this happens, say cool, you have German heritage. Because this is really what he's talking about, He knows he's American.", "NAH\n\nHe was trying to be friendly and bond and find a connection to you.\n\nSadly he did it in an annoying way. He is annoying\u2026 but not an asshole.", "I don\u2019t know what to think here. I\u2019m Canadian but can speak English French and Ukrainian and some German Greek Romanian and Polish. I\u2019ve never claimed to be anything than an ethnic Canadian as all my ancestors are immigrants, some married Ukrainian some married Filipino. It doesn\u2019t make me Ukrainian or Filipino. We are all still Canadian. I\u2019m so confused why this would be an issue for him", "NTA.\n\nI dream of the day Americans accept themselves as what they are... Americans.\n\nIt's cool to have heritage but they're Americans.\n\nPeople go out their way to make their distant heritage part of their identity... Well i truly think on some level this is a minor personality disorder. \n\nGoing straight to the war thing as a retort is also an eye roll cringe from me.", "Maybe it\u2019s cos America doesn\u2019t really have any history so they cling to an ancestral nationality to have that sense of heritage and tradition", "NAH\n\nI'm ethnically German, and I think the dude sounds funny. I don't see the issue here, and I think you're being a *little* uptight. Dude likes his German descent and German culture (as much as he's been exposed to). As far as this goes, it seems fine. It he was a wehreboo I would have a completely different position. \n\nI think this is the question around cultural appropriation--lots of cultures take \"using\" their culture differently--Japanese people love it when other cultures take part in Japanese culture, or wear Japanese clothing. Similar for many Indians and South/Latin Americans. If its done in good faith, and without looking down on the culture, I don't see the problem. \n\nAlso all the Europeans I'm sure would laugh at that American dude--let him be a joke.", "NTA\n\nIt's totally an american thing.  \nThey'll have parents, or grandparents from X country, and they'll make it their entire personnality. \n\nLike they have people born in the US not speaking a word of spanish call themselves \"latinas\", they'll make a whole deal about racism and stereotypes but will absolutely assume foreign heritage based on skin color.  \n\n\nIdk I guess just being american is not enough, you have to be exotic and quirky.", "[deleted]", "I think what you may be dealing with is a difference in culture. I\u2019m American and I say that I\u2019m French, Polish, Portuguese, Mexican, Italian, and a bunch of other things I can\u2019t name off the top of my head. I don\u2019t, however, necessarily spout all this information out in casual conversation but I do loosely connect myself due to familial connections from the past and the present. It\u2019s incredible learning about past ancestors and when we do we, at the very least I, feel a connection to the place of my ancestry. \nWe may not have stepped foot in these countries but they hold meaning to us.\n\nHere\u2019s an example, a relative of mine lived in Poland when the Nazi\u2019s invaded the country. While walking around not far outside the city/ town limits he came across an abandoned cattle car filled with Jewish people. He observed the scene for awhile to check if any one was coming before attempting to free them. He was unable to because of the lock mechanism in place but promised to come back later that night with tools to free them.\n\nThat night my relative made the mistake of telling a friend his plans. The Gestapo invaded his home while my relative was making preparations. He was sent to Dachau and lived to see liberation. It\u2019s believed that he died shortly after when some of the liberators unknowingly gave him food his body was unable to handle during malnutrition.\n\nI feel connected to my Polish roots partially due to the bravery of this relative I know that I am not from Poland but I identify as Polish because of the ancestral history.", "You\u2019re an understandable AH haha - there aren\u2019t many Germans who live in America so he was probably really happy to meet some Germans and tried to connect with you guys. Dude might have been a little too happy to share his identity with you though lol", "I was thinking I would go with Y-T-A, because it sounded like you were overreacting and didn't understand.\n\nI was born in the U.S., but I say I'm Italian. It's simply how we would say we're Italian by descent. Any American speaking to me would understand that me saying \"I'm Italian\" means I'm Italian by descent.\n\nBut on the other hand, this guy was being annoying.\n\nComparing him to my situation again, I wouldn't go on and on about Italian culture, because I know very little about it. I don't know Italian cuisine or other aspects of Italian culture and I don't speak the language.\n\nBut on the other hand, I wouldn't pretend to be an authority on Italian culture, unlike this friend of yours, who seems to want to pass himself off as an authority on all there is to know about Germany.\n\nYou put him in his place. You were polite, but firm. And he, on the other hand, was rude in his response.\n\nNTA", "NTA - and what a rude fuck he was. Also Hitler go a lot of advice on how to genocide from how the US militia murderd native Americans inc are he goes that route", "YTA\n\nThere's no singular definition of what German is. And he is, apparently, ethnically German. \n\nHe's been raised with traditions that WERE German. They are decidedly not the standard WASP American ones. So it's reductive to just declare him American if he wasn't raised as such. \n\nIt's a big part of his identity bc he was taught to value it. \n\nWhen you value something, you don't necessarily know everything about it. And maybe you laugh at what you thought it was at the outset. \n\nAnyhow. Yeah he was annoying but you were an A.", "He\u2019s not living in a delusion. He is German. He\u2019s just not from Germany. His grandparents taught him things that he considered German (which was mostly Americanized German). So they may have said \u201chere have a hot dog with sauerkraut just like Germans.\u201d His passport says American but his heritage is German. And yeah the grandparents probably didn\u2019t encourage German in the home when they had kids bc they were coming off of WW2 and probably wanted to hide that as they would have been seen in a negative light just bc of their heritage at that time frame. (Wrong but probably) You could have taken that moment to teach him a few things about his heritage that you feel are important. Instead you want to bash him.", "ESH American guy isn\u2019t wrong that he is German, but he is wrong about the extent he is German next to someone from Germany, who can speak German and knows German culture. I feel like checking him a little isn\u2019t wrong, but I think he was trying to socialize and take pride in his heritage. Maybe he has some things wrong, but in my view it\u2019s pretty understandable he wants to cling to something German.", "That guy sounds annoying, but soft YTA.

This is *especially* true of white Americans and, I would venture to say, seems to get more extreme with white cishet male Americans. Which is not to imply it always works that way. Nevertheless, I think what a European sometimes has is something Americans sometimes don't: an almost subconscious sense of their roots and ancestry tied to the region where their family is from. In America it's much more common to move to another state. Families end up thousands of miles apart from each other. You often miss out on seeing each generation through all stages of life in your family. Your town or city may lack a sense of history, or it's history is only going to go back 75 -100 years. All this adds up to someone who looks around as they mature and doesn't see much to tell them who they are. Some will choose to define themselves with other identity categories; that's why I think it's less prevalent among women, LGBTQIA people, people of color, and so on. A cishet white dude has to keep looking. Some go MAGA. Some get into a sports team like their life depends on it. And some look at their ancestry. Being German (or another nationality) becomes a huge part of their identity, because there's an incredible richness to being German that they may not see in their surroundings (I'm thinking of areas where all the old buildings have been destroyed and replaced with strip malls, for example). Is it delusional? I don't know. They aren't German the way OP is German, certainly. But I don't see anything all that bad about an American embracing the identity of their ancestors in order to create a sense of identity and richness in a life that may be lacking it. I'm half French living in rural France after several decades in California and Hawaii, though, so my perspective is colored by that. I'd certainly rather an American be super into the idea of their French ancestry and make that their whole identity rather than that they go MAGA or Qanon or something else that's going to end up harming people if taken too far.

It\u2019s wild.", "Tentatively NTA, but only because I think it\u2019s hard for Europeans to understand what white Americans mean when they say that they\u2019re German, Italian, Irish, Polish, Scandinavian. Because yes, their ethnic descent is usually two or three generations removed, and the culture they\u2019ve inherited is completely different from a person that actually lives in one of these countries. So when you pick up that he celebrates Oktoberfest despite his only german ancestors being from the opposite part of Germany that actually celebrates Oktoberfest, you roll your eyes. But there\u2019s more than meets the eye. \n\nSo in America, the dominant cultural identity is what you would describe as \u201cwhite culture\u201d: It consists of the broad fusion of English, German, and Scottish cultures, the largest European ethnic groups that have lived in the USA for 200+ years and have since largely integrated into one supergroup. These guys are hotdogs, corn on the cob, and melted cheese on everything. The American interpretations of Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas come from the traditions these people brought from Europe, which evolved as they settled and spread among the whole of the new country. They smile all the damn time for some reason. These guys are responsible for why there are a billion different kinds of Protestant Churches: Two hundred years ago, these people were the most involved, experimental, and diverse group of religious people on the planet. \n\nFor a variety of sociological and political reasons, this European fusion \u2014 that you could comfortably describe half of Americans with \u2014 is often seen as boring or lame. Most of what originated in White American culture has been adapted by all other Americans as well, and given how touchy the subject of race/ethnicity is in America, people sort of just subconsciously accept that the White American culture is the default American culture, by which all minorities/foreigners must be understood through how they contrast against it. A common phrase among American minorities, especially Black Americans with their equally rich culture that grew parallel to White Americans, goes something like \u201cWhite people have no culture\u201d \u2014 academically speaking, that\u2019s a very silly and disrespectful thing to say, but this is a common sentiment. So, younger people often cling to whatever genuine cultural distinctions they can. \n\nThat isn\u2019t to say your American friend is bullshitting about his connections to Germany, not really. He probably does celebrate Oktoberfest every year, since lots of German-Americans have come to claim the holiday as a broader celebration of German culture, despite German immigrants having come from every part of Europe. It\u2019s likely that he did eat lots of sausages and sauerkraut. His grandparents may even speak German, though most German-Americans stopped passing down the language when America joined WWI and anti-German sentiment spread across the nation, so he might even be too far removed from even that. So none of this is going to get him a jus sanguinis citizenship, but it is regardless a part of his life. One which is a bit special to him. \n\nSo on one hand, I think telling him that he\u2019s not a real German had upset him deeply. I feel bad for him. But you\u2019re not an asshole for it, because he sounds reeeeeaaally obnoxious. He\u2019s got a really desperate need to have some kinship with you, and if it wasn\u2019t you, sooner or later another German was gonna wake him up. Now, if he had approached you with an awareness that he was German-American, the more reasonable/polite thing would be to try and learn more about what Germany is actually like through you, instead of believing you guys have so much in common. But most Americans don\u2019t think like that, and most Europeans don\u2019t even understand any of this nonsense, and just get creeped out by 4th generation American immigrants with a stronger nationalism for a country they\u2019ve never visited than 90% of that countries actual citizenry.

Just because most jazz players are African American doesn't mean that it's less American. Because African American are still American.\n\nAlso, African American have very different traditions from Senegalese, Kenyans, Congolese... in other words, actual African people. If an African American come in any African country, he will be seen as an American, absolutely not an African. Just because Jazz or Funk has some kind of ancient roots doesn't make it fully African.\n\nAs I said in my example, no cultural things come 100% from a country. Following your logic, Japan doesn't have a culture because most of that culture come from China. But it's wrong, because Chinese culture in Japan evolved and became something unique, totally Japanese.\n\nI'm French, and I don't see French Canadians as \"honorary French people\" just because they have French ancestry and speak my language. Their culture might have some French influences, but it's still theirs, not mine. Qu\u00e9bec is very different from France despite having obvious similarities.\n\nPretty sure people in Africa think the same about African American, for them Beyonc\u00e9 is 100% American because she was raised there. Maybe they take some pride by seeing African influences in Motown music, but I don't think they are thinking \"hey, WE made it\". African American music evolved into something unique that only exists in the US, and those songs are about American society - therefore it is part of American culture. Mostly played by one particular community, but that community lives in the US territory.\n\nWould you say that Tango is not argentinian because most Argentinian have Spanish or Italian ancestors ? Would you say that the Alhambra in Spain is not Spanish because it has origings from North Africa ? Would you say that the Colosseum in N\u00eemes is not French because it's from the Roman Empire, therefore it's more \"Italian\" ? No culture is homogenous and everyone has steal something from every country.\n\nIt's kinda like Zouk music in France. It's from the French overseas territories (Martinique, etc...). It is carribean music, but that doesn't make it less French, because Martinique and Guadeloupe are part of France. Is it anything like Alsacian, Corsican or Breton music ? Absolutely not, but it's still French, because French culture is not homogenous.", "Most Americans have accents but there is a mainstream accent designed to be void of accent found in [American broadcasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W68VaOuY6ew).

It's quite popular there and in other parts of Europe as part of various dishes. It's the hot dog that makes it an American thing and not a European/German one.\n\nEDIT: So what he said \"hot dogs with sauerkraut\" to proof his connection to Germany actually revealed the opposite of what he tried to achieve. As far as I know most Germans find it sacrilegious to put sauerkraut on hot dogs. Therefore it was a disconnect for OP to call \"hot dogs with sauerkraut\" German food.", "But the American tourist is the one who is unaware of the fact that he is using a phrase in _the wrong_ cultural context, and is offending people. I don't have an issue with two Americans describing themselves as Norwegian and Irish or whatever when they are talking to each other in an American setting. But if they call themselves Norwegian while traveling here, (I eat lefse!) I will have to pull myself together a bit and try to explain that while calling themselves Norwegian-American is fine, calling themselves Norwegian is annoying and insulting", "Agreed. The American's claim to German heritage, symbolized by Oktoberfest and other stereotypes, shows a clear lack of understanding and authentic connection to what it means to be German. This isn't just an oversight; it's a glaring misrepresentation.\n\nLanguage, for instance, isn't just a minor part of culture; it's the vessel through which culture is transmitted and lived. The inability of the American to speak German reflects a superficial connection to Germanness. But it goes deeper than that. His association with German culture based on clich\u00e9s and distant ancestry reveals a profound ignorance of the rich and complex world that is German culture.\n\nCulture is not an inheritance that can be claimed; it's earned, lived, and experienced. The OP rightly dismisses this shallow connection, as it doesn't capture the complexity and richness of German culture. His response is not just justified; it's commendable. He confronted a gross misrepresentation of his culture and sought to enlighten the American to a more nuanced and truthful understanding.\n\nThe OP's response, though it might seem harsh, brings to mind Plato's Allegory of the Cave. He attempted to pull the American out of the shadows of misunderstanding and show him the reality of 'Germanness'. He tried to awaken the American to a more profound understanding of culture, beyond mere caricatures and romanticism. The American might have been defensive, but he should ultimately thank the OP for revealing a more authentic perspective.", "Well, ignorant assholes are everywhere unfortunately.", "Ok, \n\nMy point was not (edit) that it wasn't American. It was that it's not tied to all of America\n\nAnd attributing some cultural aspects to all of America isn't the whole picture\n\n\"Identify as American\" which according to a lot of people here\n\nIs jazz music and Hollywood. Two things that don't encompass all of America.\n\nThere's still no real historical backbone that is America when only the decendants of the Mayflower were here for all of it.\n\nAs a said, if your ancestors came in the 1900s, you literally have less than half of American history and culture for you and your ancestors.\n\nIt's like, why should I only ascribe myself to Hollywood and a patriotic history my ancestors weren't even around for? \n\nJazz is American, but it's a subset of American that not ALL Americans participate in culturally. \n\nSame with Hollywood. That's why there's cultural regions in the US, because we identify with those more than with each other on a whole.\n\nI have more in common with people from the south as that's where I live than Americans in California or NYC.\n\nBecause the cultures are very different. People in Houston have a different culture than other people in Texas and often have a lot of closer ties to Louisiana. But overall, all of Texas has more in common with each other than people in the North East. \n\nAnd jazz and Hollywood doesn't unite us as a culture. \n\nPatriotism and some forms of assimilation and media unite us politically. We prefer to be one unit, because it's just how it's been. \n\nBut again, jazz, art, literature, and Hollywood don't define us as a whole, since many of us don't have shared history with other Americans or shared life experiences or culture. \n\nGermans have a relative amount of shared history. Finland too.\n\nAmerica has a lot of history for being a new country, but there's loads of different types of people who came together at different periods who have nothing in common except for the fact we live in the United States of American and are nationally American\n\nWe can't agree on media, gun control, taxes, lgbtq rights, feminism, education, alcohol laws, language, immigration  and almost everything under the sun, which all has to do with cultural ties and connections\n\nAnd trust me, it's not jazz or Hollywood that makes people here feel close to each other as a whole. \n\nAnd we are more divided than ever because people are waking up to realizing the only thing keeping America as a whole is the faux identity of American being a single congruent conglomerate.\n\nWhen in reality it's a bunch of different people with wildly different ways of life who can't agree with each other about how to run the country. \n\nWhen you say \"identify as American\"\n\nBesides jazz (the 1920s) and cinema (again, started in the 1920s) what is \"American\" \n\nTo people outside of the US?\n\nAnd why is it always people outside of the US who want us to identify only as Americans\n\nScottish people in Scotland do have the privilege of being able to identify with the Natice culture that's both their ethnicity and nationality of a culture that's thousands of years old\n\nNon native Americans all have ethnicities they are not allowed to identify as even if their families were around for less than half of US history, and not even in the US for the invention of jazz or hollywood, or children when it was created. \n\n\"Oh, your great grandparents came to the US from Spain in the year 1905? Well, your culture is now American even though I can't articulate what that is except for jazz and hollywood, you have to identify as that even though your ancestors faced persecution and forced assimilation. It doesn't matter if you want to get back to your roots. You're only roots are American even if you only have 3 generations of ancestors in the US\" \n\nIt makes no sense to ambiguously define American culture as entertainment started in the 1910s/1920s and expect people to be like, yeah, I am nothing but modern American culture that just started to exist as of the last century after we became assimilated into one weird conglomerate often due to the force of the Kkk and racists.\n\nThere's nothing tangible or long lasting for people to really grasp on in the US. Jazz and hollywood aren't my culture in the US, as no one in my family has ever done either. \n\nBut you can go back into festivals all over the world and know those people have done that celebration for centuries and is a tradition passed down from one person to another.\n\nHollywood is not passed down from average American family member to average American child as a time honored tradition. Jazz can be, for people more culturally tied to it.\n\nSo hollywood, is A culture but not the culture of Americans on average. \n\nAmerica is meant to force people to be stripped of any identity other than American so what's left is patriotism and work hard and grind for the American dream.\n\nSo, I guess, at the end of the day, one thing out of my rant can be all of America's culture.\n\nWork. Grind culture. You're worthless if you're poor and you need to work and make money.\n\nAnd honestly who wants to be part of this patriotic land stripped of identity other than working for other people towards a fake American dream? \n\nJazz and hollywood were formed by people who are nationally American, but they are new to Americans and aren't a really good representation of passed down traditions.\n\nCuz, except for rich nepo babies, who gets passed down the time honored tradition of jazz and hollywood\n\nThe one thing the majority of Americans have in common with each other is that we are decendants of immigrants (for others it was enslaved people) \n\nWe don't all share jazz just because it was invented by some Americans. We don't all identify with hollywood just cuz it started in the US. \n\nBut the majority of people here have stories of immigrant parents, grandparents, great grandparents\n\nSo we talk about our shared history of our ancestors coming from all over the world. And for some reason, yall don't like that that's a very real and much bigger part of our culture.\n\nThat is, immigration, forced assimilation, lost culture in the name of being a single conglomerate hard working society of people who only care about the \"American dream\" \n\nYall again, have your native culture and ethnicity and nationality as all being the same thing. \n\nSo, you don't understand having those three things being different. What's a 3rd generation Irish person? They're not Native Americans. Irish culture isn't the prevailing culture, and Ireland isn't their nationality. American is. So, what can they identify as when they don't have much in common with the whole of America except for being American? What traditions to the 3rd generations of Italians do they share? 3rd generation of Asians\n\nNone of their ethnicities are the prevailing culture. Their ethnicity isn't their nationality. And they aren't Native to their nationality/land. \n\nIt's that cultural loss of identity a lot of 3rd to 4th generation Americans are realizing is really sad and depressing and that their ancestors had little to do with anything in us history or \"culture\" that is looking for an actual root to find. \n.", "As someone from an even younger country (Australia), we don\u2019t do this shit - it\u2019s uniquely American, and just as weird to us.\n\nLove it or hate it, we are where we\u2019re born - we might be interested in our various ancestries, but trying to pass ourselves off as being from those places in front of others who actually live there is just asking for trouble.", "literally it sucks so much but knowing that white people deal with this while traveling in europe is kinda funny i\u2019m ngl", "Did they decide that you were therefore African American?
