She does it for herself, not for you. She had to get a reality check.", "NTA. She's manipulative. The \"Well I just feel sorry for you.\" is the justification.\n\nDo you have a signed contract on the \"Rent to own\" situation? If not, I would be worried. And if you didn't, I would still be worried. Why aren't your parents contributing to their own living situation?", "NTA\n\nJust reading the first part of how your mother is tired me out.\n\nAs someonne who can relate heavily to your character and the annoyance that is people not understanding someonne liking to be alone i agree that she should not keep telling you the same thing over and over, especially if that thing is how you should be instead of how you are.\n\nthe sad part is that you are most likely correct and that it comes from a position of love/care and not realising people tend to live their lives very different ways. Unfortunately people who are convinced their way of life is the best/only way are very hard to convince to change their minds", "NTA.  Your response was perfect.", "NTA. You tried the polite way yet she didn't relent.\n\nAnd I 100% understand. I'm likely autistic. I meet friends at most once a week, and I'm fine if I don't. I prefer not to date as there's more hassle than it's worth. I've bought my own house and I live with my cat very happily in it.\n\nOthers judge and feel sorry for me and that's fine, I don't care. I however don't tolerate anyone trying to press their \"truth\" onto me. Judge me as much as you want, but do so silently.\n\nI have always become instantly furious whenever people try to alter my truth. Either by telling me I lie when I don't, or trying to convince me to feel differently than what I feel. And I mean furious. I've wondered if it's an autistic trait as that is usually the only things that makes me react that strongly.", "NTA.  Sadly her communication style was indirect.\n\nFrom my reading of her statements, she wanted reassurance that she was a good mother and that you were ok.\n\nAlso it sounds like she wanted to emotionally and physiologically feel connected to get regulated.", "NTA - she is worried but she is also not listening. You were polite and she kept pushing until you broke and even then you weren't rude. And what was she actually proposing you do - live out what she thinks the perfect life is? Times have changed and just because online, it doesn't mean necessarily you are not engaging with people. Just engaging in managable doses.", "NTA. I don't even think she feels sorry for you. It's more likely that she just wants you to be how she wants you to be. It's just another piece of manipulation.", "Okay so - I\u2019m gonna give everybody the benefit of the doubt and say NAH here. \n\nI do think she was being annoying, but I don\u2019t think that she necessarily crossed into asshole territory in this interaction.\n\nIt sounds like she has a hard time understanding you because the two of you are so different. I wonder if she\u2019s projecting her own views of happiness onto you because she doesn\u2019t understand what makes you happy and why/how those things make you happy, so she\u2019s filling her own knowledge gaps with what she does know. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, it may be worth spending some therapy time talking about what happiness looks like in introverts vs. extroverts and for neuro-atypical people. \n\nNot saying you have a responsibility to talk about these things with her, but if the current situation is annoying you, a good few conversations might help you both.", "NTA.

I had a kid during COVID who now seems to have some social anxiety, so like, it's a thing and I want him to have a happy and fulfilling life. But my job isn't to put that on him. My job is to give him opportunities and experiences to decide what he likes and doesn't like, and figure out if there are underlying things that need to be addressed (and get some help if so), to give him the best tools to live a happy and fulfilling life *on his terms*. \n\nIf anyone is at *fault* here, it's her, and her putting this \"I feel sorry\" crap on you is at best manipulative. It's not really about you. If she's dissatisfied with how you turned out, she need only look in the mirror.\n\nBut the fact that you're on the spectrum, introverted, and just, you know, *a different person* makes her comments especially gross. It's like she's blaming you for not being who she wanted you to be. Whether that's because you have autism or just have different interests, it's shitty and wrong. \n\nFrankly, I think you were as kind as you could have possibly been. If you were a child, more guidance and efforts to push you out of your comfort zone a little bit might be appropriate. But you're not. You're an adult. Either she tried and you decided that you're just not interested in the stuff she is, (fair), or she didn't and she's trying to suddenly force that now (not cool).", "NTA.", "NTA. You will probably have this same conversation again and again over the years. She is only familiar with her own life's needs/patterns and cannot comprehend that yours is at all satisfying. It's likely that she will never fully understand it and will keep feeling that you are not living your best life. If there's a relative that is more (self-aware, deeper thinking?)  than she is  - maybe have them try to explain it to her in a way that she will comprehend? It might get her to leave you alone about this and not be so bothered by it.", "NTA. Seems pretty weird for someone \"feeling sorry\" for someone who's content with their life. Maybe your mom doesn't think \"content\" is good enough? Personally, I would feel insulted, and probably would have responded with some snarky comment about her life if my mom did the same.", "I don\u2019t think this was too far. Her feelings about you are not your problem. NTA\n\nI generally think it\u2019s fine for her to express her opinions to you once. But if you disagree, it\u2019s not okay to keep repeating herself. She needs to let it go and accept that you have a different perspective.\n\nOr if she can\u2019t let it go - if this will continue to be painful for her - she needs to deal with that on her own. Get a therapist or something. Not your problem.\n\nOne thing that might work: \u201cI feel more distant from you when it sounds like you want me to be a different person than who I am.\u201d This highlights the cost of her behavior - that it annoys you - but in gentler language that suggests how she can have a better relationship with you.", "I'm going to say NAH.\n\nMost of us want to be good parents and raise happy, healthy children who can do well in this world. We do our best and can't help second-guessing ourselves. Your mom watched you achieve a satisfaction in life that doesn't look like her plan for him, and it's so hard to say, \"he didn't reach the plans I set for him, but that doesn't mean I failed him.\" \n\nShe wants the absolute best for you but is operating on a different definition so she feels like she failed her son.\n\nOf course she needs to adjust her point of view, but it takes time to undo 2 decades of work. Checking in on you and your happiness is one way of trying to figure out what she can do. You responding in frustration is equally understandable. \n\nNobody's perfect, but it seems to me like she cares and just struggles to translate between your two personalities.", "I find your response a bit insensitive but you know your situation better than anyone so you do you.", "NTA.... But, I do want to play devil's advocate here, by sharing my person experience. (Sorry for the long post).  \n\n\nMy son is ASD. I don't see him as having anything wrong with him. He sees things differently to people and doesn't always know how to interact with people. It is my job to help him find a strategy that enables him to function in society. That being said, he is a teenager who hates the idea of going out, socializing, or having to interact with people. He can be very friendly and outgoing, but he needs a lot of down time and time to himself to \"recover\" from the energy spent doing so. \n\nPersonally, I think it is important for my son to learn social skills. We have a monthly outing into town together, and occasional trips to local areas just to \"get out the house\" for a bit (usually once every 1-2 weeks). We also see my family once every 2-3 months (they don't live locally to us). Whilst he finds these challenging at times, overall he does enjoy the time spent out - and I feel having the connection with others and learning how to interact with others is important. \n\nHowever, I understand that equally important to this is his \"down time\". We plan breaks in our trips in quieter areas where he can take time out. We avoid going to very busy places with lots of noise or people for long periods. When he gets back, he goes off into his room (or I go to mine to give him space if he is playing on the xbox, in the lounge, with his online friends) so he can unwind. I think stepping outside your comfort area occasionally is healthy, but it shouldn't go as far as causing anxiety. Balance is important! \n\nRegarding your story - I think your mother has good intentions (see above), but may not fully understand your needs or your coping mechanisms. I also get the feeling you may not have sat and spoken with her much about what you feel does/doesn't work for you. I don't know what your relationship with your mother is like, but I think an honest, calm, discussion on how you feel and what you need would go a long way to her understanding and supporting you. Mother's are not mind-readers, and whilst something may be obvious to you, or normal today... it may not be obvious to her, or normal when she was that age. \n\nIt may also be worth helping her better understand your diagnosis. Your behaviour is not unusual for someone who is on the spectrum, nor is the lashing out when frustrated. Whilst you are NOT TA here... it is worth considering apologizing for snapping at her. You are not apologising for what you said, but rather how you said it. Explain you are frustrated and restate your views in a calm manner and let her hear your side of things.", "She\u2019s probably just worried about how he\u2019s going to get on after she\u2019s gone.\n\nLonely single men don\u2019t do well when they get old.", "Essentially, my father tanked the finances so badly that they had to refinance the house to keep it.\n\nMy grandmother gave my dad some property in Tennessee that they're moving to in a year or so. I could either join them or stay where I am. So I decided to stay and take over the house because finding my \"own\" place would be way more expensive.\n\nI signed a contract with my dad, essentially paying his mortgage. When it's paid off, the house is mine. If we decide to sell it, I get back the money I paid.", "But he's not lonely? Being satisfied with his life and his level of social contact generally means he doesn't feel lonely because of it.", "I understand he feels that way and there might never be a problem.  Just explaining where her worry would come from.  I would be sad if my son ended up all alone as an old man too so I get it.", "but he's happy so it's not your place or OP's mother's place to feel sorry for someone who's happy and satisfied with their life; this is such a weird take."]}
