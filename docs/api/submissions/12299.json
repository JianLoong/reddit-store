At some point in her life being able to spend time overnight with you (provided you're a good parent ig) would be a good thing, but that can't just be jumped into, and considering the fact that you barely have time with her, it is not your place to make the decision on when that jump should be made. You prioritized your want to have her over, over her own comfort and mental well-being and frankly... That's a really bad thing for a parent to be doing. You said she cried like you tortured her and you didn't literally do so but you also didn't do anything actually good for her either. By picking her up and bringing her inside you violated her boundaries and probably upset her a lot, same with just forcing her to be in a place that's practically unknown to her (yes she spends occasional weekends with you but she's young and it's not often) when she obviously has issues with that sort of thing or with people she isn't that close to (again you are her dad but you do not have these weekends that often). Even if you didn't torture her, this incident still caused her obvious distress. \n\nYour ex also doesn't really seem to be using it as an \"excuse\" more so it seems like she's doing what she can for your kid who obviously went through something traumatic, and part of that is by letting her have easy access to a safe space, and right now your home is not that space.

However, it's important to consider your daughter's emotional well-being during these visits, especially in light of her anxiety.\n\nIt seems that the arrangement of having your ex pick up your daughter for bath and bedtime was working relatively well for your daughter's emotional state. While you have the right to want uninterrupted weekends with her, forcing a sudden change could exacerbate her anxiety and create more stress for everyone involved.\n\nWith that said, I have to render my verdict: YTA. Your intentions to bond with your daughter are understandable, but it's crucial to prioritize her needs and comfort in this situation. A more gradual transition to longer visits and overnights might be a better approach, along with open communication and cooperation with your ex.\n\nMoving forward, consider working with your ex and possibly a therapist to develop a plan that eases your daughter into spending more time with you, while still respecting her emotional needs.

Seems like you\u2019re so intent on making your ex seem like the enemy that you\u2019re missing the forest for the trees - your daughter experienced a trauma and is not coping well. \n\nIf this is your approach to parenting, you should absolutely have your time reduced for the sake of your daughter until you speak with a mental health professional yourself.", "You LEFT your daughter!!!

Also, even then, a lot of children who love with both parents, will go through time when they may only want mom (or dad, or other person).

Take your daughter on some sort of fun outing or adventure, and then return her to mom, when she needs/feels anxious/begins to meltdown. Also, see if you can perhaps see her more often? Even if just for short times. Do you still live very far? Would mom allow for you to have more time, if you came to near where they live and picked up your daughter for a couple of hours?

Your kid has suffered recent trauma and barely knows you, and you still insisted that she spend the whole weekend with you just to stick it to your ex. You're immature, petty, and spiteful and you're a bad parent to boot.

You traumatized your child further by not meeting her needs. What you did was selfish and cruel.", "YTA, and why did you move away from your child?", "No. It\u2019s not that he wanted time.
