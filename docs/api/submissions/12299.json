At some point in her life being able to spend time overnight with you (provided you're a good parent ig) would be a good thing, but that can't just be jumped into, and considering the fact that you barely have time with her, it is not your place to make the decision on when that jump should be made. You prioritized your want to have her over, over her own comfort and mental well-being and frankly... That's a really bad thing for a parent to be doing. You said she cried like you tortured her and you didn't literally do so but you also didn't do anything actually good for her either. By picking her up and bringing her inside you violated her boundaries and probably upset her a lot, same with just forcing her to be in a place that's practically unknown to her (yes she spends occasional weekends with you but she's young and it's not often) when she obviously has issues with that sort of thing or with people she isn't that close to (again you are her dad but you do not have these weekends that often). Even if you didn't torture her, this incident still caused her obvious distress. \n\nYour ex also doesn't really seem to be using it as an \"excuse\" more so it seems like she's doing what she can for your kid who obviously went through something traumatic, and part of that is by letting her have easy access to a safe space, and right now your home is not that space.

However, it's important to consider your daughter's emotional well-being during these visits, especially in light of her anxiety.\n\nIt seems that the arrangement of having your ex pick up your daughter for bath and bedtime was working relatively well for your daughter's emotional state. While you have the right to want uninterrupted weekends with her, forcing a sudden change could exacerbate her anxiety and create more stress for everyone involved.\n\nWith that said, I have to render my verdict: YTA. Your intentions to bond with your daughter are understandable, but it's crucial to prioritize her needs and comfort in this situation. A more gradual transition to longer visits and overnights might be a better approach, along with open communication and cooperation with your ex.\n\nMoving forward, consider working with your ex and possibly a therapist to develop a plan that eases your daughter into spending more time with you, while still respecting her emotional needs.

It's your child's time too and she didn't want that. Maybe work with your ex to stay in a place where both of you can be there so the child feels more comfortable. Forcing your child to be in your presence isn't going to magically form some paternal bond. You have to do A LOT of work to make that relationship possible and the current way you are going about it is going to make your child want to cut you out of their life entirely.

They believe the more money they send in support should directly correlate with the amount of access they have to the child.\n\nSo when they are denied access to their child for whatever reason, the kids best interests or wishes, illness, a parent withholding access out of pettiness, doesn\u2019t matter. They are equally angry in any of the scenarios because:\n\n*They aren\u2019t getting their money\u2019s worth*\n\nI try very hard to not push my own stuff on other people. But it kind of seems to me that the reason why he approached the visit like he did, the reason the child contacting the mother made him mad, the reason why (besides the obvious) he doesn\u2019t want to pay higher support payments is because he\u2019s not getting his moneys worth *now*.\n\nIf the OP is one of these guys, child support *buys* him whatever his custody agreement is.\n\nAll that to say I\u2019m not getting really caring vibes either \ud83d\ude06", "How is he not paying max child support anyway?

Our other child is old enough that if we went back to court the judge would consider her opinion. The problem is her sister can't assert her own opinion because of her significant delays. Neither of our kids wants to go over there regularly. It's the same thing every time. \"Mom do I HAVE to go.\" Yes you have to go because we have a custody agreement. My youngest use to just throw huge tantrums and have meltdowns (not the same thing) about going but now most of the time she just huffs and grumbles.
