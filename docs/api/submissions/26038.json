My two sons, his uncles also repeatedly warned him, my sons' friends warned him and his 13 year old brother warned him as well.

It was a constant battle over the next 4 days.\n\nOn Wednesday, after 4 solid days of this my daughter calls me and says  that my dog nipped his finger a little and I told her to put the dog in my room to keep them separate. My daughter tells me no, it's fine, they are playing nice. Next thing I know I get a second call from her that my dog nipped him harder on his chin now and harder that it scratched his jaw and drew blood on his chin where her teeth pierced the skin.\n\nMy daughter was furious, she accused her brothers of just sitting there and letting it happen. She told me she was taking her son to the hospital and would report the dog bite and the police will take my dog and she will be euthanized. I said that isn't fair to the dog because in all fairness she had endured quite a bit over the last 4 days and most dogs would have acted a lot sooner, my daughter exploded on me saying that I don't care about my grandson.\n\n I told her that of course I care about him but he was warned repeatedly and the dog refrained from snapping at him for 4 whole days, that she had warned him with the first gentle snap and I had told her to put the dog in my room, there's no way she deserves to be put to sleep.After that the 11 year old told us that he and his mom are going to punish the dog by having her put to sleep and my daughter said that she's taking her boys and I will never see my grandchildren again.

Your grandson is 11 years old \u2014 old enough to know that he shouldn\u2019t be aggravating a dog. He was warned multiple times. Your daughter is at fault for not doing something about his behaviour. \n\nIt took your poor, clearly very patient, dog *four entire days* to get wound up enough to give the warning snap. Your daughter should\u2019ve taken that as the warning it was, but she ignored it. Why she wasn\u2019t supervising your grandson while he was aggravating a dog I don\u2019t know \u2014 that was negligent of her. I don\u2019t know a single parent who wouldn\u2019t be keeping an eye on their child when they were behaving that way with a dog.", "NTA, your grandson needs to learn not to mess with animals and how to be around them and read their cues. You tried to warn him and he kept instigating. I hope you can fight their report and your dog doesn't end up getting put down, that's really shitty of your daughter and grandson to threaten you with over an instigated nip.", "NTA - why isn't your daughter teaching her child how to treat animals ?", "NTA Your grandson harassed the dog and refused to heed any warnings. If your daughter reports the dog, the worst that will happen is quarantine. They test the dog for disease and aggression, if the dog is healthy and docile, cases closed. You and your sons can give statements about your grandson's aggression towards the dog. The problem between you and your daughter, well that's something for you two to resolve.", "NTA but your daughter and grandchild are a hot mess. Any dog would react that way. I\u2019m so sorry that they are being so horrible to you over this. Ultimately your daughter is responsible for raising a child who doesn\u2019t know how to act around dogs and who does not listen to their mother or grandmother.  Shame on her.  I hope your dog is safe.  Give her extra cuddles she deserves it after what she has been through.", "NTA... your daughter didn't get the memo about putting YOUR dog in your room even though your offered it. Tell them to get out of your house and stop being a poor guest if she wants to play that game. If the little boy wants to keep opening the door and getting a dog he is not supposed to be harassing - the boy and his mother are the issue.\n\nAlso... I FIND IT DISTUUURBING that the daughter would even have the guts to blame you or the dog or threaten you. I hope you don't help them often because it's time for them to help themselves.", "NTA - I had a similar incident regarding a niece and my cat. Your grandson needs to learn to respect an animal's boundaries. It's his mom's job to do so, but she wasn't doing it so the dog had to do it herself. And maybe next time you tell your grandson to leave the dog alone, he'll do it.", "NTA\n\nSame thing happened with my step kid (6m) my older dog kept growling while he was trying to pet him, get in his face, obviously giving warning signs. He was told repeatedly to stop (not as severe harassment from my step kid compared to your grandson) My dog nipped him on the arm and punctured him, despite my efforts to stop it. His mother was furious and acted the same way. I told his dad (my bf) he could get tf out of my apartment if he took her side since it\u2019s in my name.\n\nMy bf took my side. Step son is no longer allowed within arms reach of my dog but I refuse to put my dog away while he\u2019s here on the weekends. This is my dog\u2019s home and I will not punish him because step son didn\u2019t listen.\n\n11 years old is PLENTY old enough to know what no means. My only issue here with you is not telling them to take their kid and get tf out of your house after your grandson kept abusing him.", "NTA\n\nHe bullied the dog for several days straight.", "NTA - grandchildren don't interest me and this part of the reason why. Your daughter is a terrible mother.", "NTA.\n\nGood puppy.", "I am frankly amazed it took that long for the dog to retaliate. ADHD is not an excuse for harassment of your pet. Kid should have learned the lesson after the first nip but hopefully learned to respect your dog after the second one. My question here is why was this allowed to continue for so long? Your daughter should have been told if the kid doesn\u2019t leave the dog be then she needs to take him home. Failing that, arrangements should have been made to board your dog in kennels for the duration of the stay. Not a strong enough stance was taken on this so everyone except the dog sucks here.", "NTA Your dog definitely should not be put to sleep.  As much as it will hurt, not having the grandson around for a while will not be a bad thing.  Just wait until he's a teen.  His mother is going to have more serious issues to deal with.", "ESH. Your grandson is 11 and should absolutely be responsible for his own behavior around animals. He was warned repeatedly and every dog can and will bite when pushed enough. \n\nHowever, as a dog owner when your dog\u2019s boundaries aren\u2019t being respected, it\u2019s up to you to keep them safe. You should have separated them.", "ESH\n\nYou are responsible for your dog.  You did not separate your dog after the first nip.  You knew your dog was stressed, you knew this kid was not playing appropriately with him so you chose to be a negligent owner and let them continue to play.\n\nThe mother is also the asshole for failing to monitor her child.\n\nFrom your description the child should not have been alone with the dog at any time.", "ESH. \n\nYou all allowed a neurodivergent kid to torture your animal, a rescue, no less.\n\nYour daughter, in addition to the above, is now wanting the dog to be put down because she is an ah who cannot control her kid. I get that he has learning issues, but that\u2019s when you remove one or the other. \n\nYou all should have removed the dog from this bullshit.", "ESH. Once it became clear just how much of a risk this visit was to everyone\u2019s safety, and that putting the dog up wasn\u2019t a viable solution due to noncompliance, they should have been asked to leave.", "YTA - That poor dog should not have to had endure a whole day, let alone four days, of dealing with your grandchild.  You had a responsibility from the gate, and explain to your daughter that if she nor you were able to discipline the child, they'd need to leave the premises immediately. \n\nYou risked your precious dog's life, in his supposed safe space, because you couldn't stand up to your daughter in your own home.\n\nYou need to grow a pair and your daughter needs a knock off her entitled ass horse.", "ESH You should have put a stop to this at least 3 days ago. You put your dog in a dangerous position.", "Info: I do have an opinion on whether you're an asshole or not but firstly, why did you leave your dog with them? Especially since you knew your nephew was harassing her?", "yta.  You allowed people in your home to repeatedly harass the dog.  That dog is your responsibility.  If you couldn\u2019t keep him separated , then tell them to leave.  You knew your grandson was harassing the dog over and over.  I sincerely hope the dog isn\u2019t euthanized but it needs to be removed from your care.", "YTA - the dog is aggressive and should be put down", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
