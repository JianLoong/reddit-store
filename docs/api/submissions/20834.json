{"id": 20834, "submission_id": "14lauzj", "title": "AITA for using the bathroom for 25 minutes and almost making my wife late for work", "selftext": "This morning my wife (28F) and I (29M) had an argument because I used the shower before her and she said she needed to be at work on time and I took too long. I used the shower for probably 15 minutes and was in the bathroom for 25 minutes. Before I got in, I said I was going to take a shower and she said she needed to have one too. She said she would take a shower when her coffee was done. At that time the coffee was still on the burner so I said I will take one first. She didn't say anything and I took the shower. After the shower she knocked on the door and said she needed to come in because she will be late. I said that is fine and she can come in earlier if she needs to. After that I said I'm going to work and \"goodbye\". I thought this issue was over and was trying to go back to normal. She refused to say goodbye back to me and I asked her if she was going to say goodbye and she said she won't. She said I should know what days she goes in to the office and what time she needs to be there (she has hybrid work), but I just said I don't know those details and she should have said something earlier if she needed something by a certain time. She also said I'm self-centered, and I feel like I was pretty calm until that point but then I got defensive. I said it is not my job to keep track of everything about her schedule and work around it, and that she's hypocritical because she doesn't know my schedule in terms of how long I spend in the bathroom and that I don't care if she knocks. After that she said that she doesn't care about me, and she wants me to leave faster because she doesn't want to see me. \r  \n\r  \nI feel like this is a recurring pattern: something minor happens and then she goes from 0 to 100 in no time, she gets extremely angry and says I am self-centered and now she \"loves me less\" in those exact words. This happens with things like us missing a bus that comes every 15 minutes because I wanted to walk slowly down a long escalator rather than run down it, and a few other things I can't remember exactly now. One time we were making food based on a complicated recipe and I asked her to repeat and clarify a step and she said \"I already told you!\" and I said to stop giving an attitude and she got extremely mad and said I'm annoying.\r  \n\r  \nSo am I being inconsiderate or self-centered, and otherwise how do you work this stuff out? Also, I feel like the typical advice of \"communication and understanding other views\" will not work here. She is someone who basically believes anything that causes an issue should never be spoken of again, and if I were to bring this up calmly and say how I feel it would probably start another argument. But again maybe I am just bad at resolving these things in a way that does not make her defensive.", "created_utc": 1687962146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14lauzj/aita_for_using_the_bathroom_for_25_minutes_and/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you notice little things about her? Do you notice big things about her? Does she have to communicate every little thing to do because you don\u2019t put the effort in to pay attention?\n\nHer response is telling me that she isn\u2019t upset about just the shower, she\u2019s upset that you didn\u2019t consider she had to go in to work that day, and she\u2019s upset she had to tell you that in the first place. Perhaps she\u2019s being unreasonable in this instance, but the idea that it isn\u2019t your job to know her schedule tells me you simply don\u2019t pay attention to her or her life. That\u2019s likely what she\u2019s upset about. \n\nEvery example you provided  makes it very obvious she feels like you don\u2019t listen to her. And making someone late to a bus because YOU decide YOU want to walk slower is so infuriating and selfish I can\u2019t even believe it. You do seem inconsiderate and self centered, and she seems completely over it.", "I am a woman and let me decode this interaction for ya (at least within the parameters of my experience):\n\nYou: I am showering.\n\nWife: Ok, I need to shower too. I'll plan to do that once my coffee is ready. (In her mind she has just told you, I need to shower fairly soon and we both know I need to get to work. I've told you that I need the shower and conveyed that I need it within 10 or so minutes as that's the most coffee will take. I am letting you take the first shower as you're ready but in my mind I have told you that I need the shower very soon to get to work on time.)\n\nYou: In the shower for 15 minutes\n\nHer: At the 10ish minute mark, having finished coffee. Why is he still in there? I need to get ready and get to work. I'll try and do something else but I'm feeling a little anxious. Hope there's still hot water.\n\nYou: Finishes shower at 15 minute mark.\n\nHer: Thank goodness! I can just make it, I am sure he is going to open the door and rush out in a towel at any moment and say he's sorry for taking so long.\n\nYou: at the 20 minute mark doing your thing.\n\nHer: OMG, what is he doing? I will knock in 2 more minutes. It's rude to knock and harrass someone in the bathroom but I am so late and stressed now. Why is he doing this? I told him I needed to shower and I told him my timeframe. Why doesn't he listen? Why is he selfish? I hate being this stressed out early in the day. Ok, now I will knock.\n\nYou: at the 25 minute mark, all relaxed and happy coming out of the bathroom, surprised Pikachu face at her being stressed when she's probably been bottling up annoyance for at least the last 15 minutes.  \n\nYou seem pretty oblivious. Your wife isn't going from 0-60 in 1 second. You haven't listened, you've ignored her clearly stated needs (in her mind), and then you act surprised that she's annoyed and in a rush to get out the door. If you aren't saying, \"I'm sorry, I didn't realize when you needed to leave, can I help you get ready?\" she doesn't want to discuss this with you when she's tight on time and already stressed out. Your other examples aren't as clear but do show that you don't listen/pay attention and then act as though her being annoyed has come out of nowhere.", "YTA. No sense of urgency after wife communicated a sense of urgency is likely why she defaults to going from 0 to 100.

You are self-centered. I WFH and my wife works in-office. I defer to her on the shower times because she HAS to be somewhere, showered, at a specific time and I don't.

She also told you before you got in that she needed one and you took almost half an hour. It\u2019s about lack of consideration or thought for your partner. It can seem like things go from 0-100 but when you\u2019re repeatedly treated without thought or consideration it wears on you.", "YtA She went from 0-100 because you expressed how much you don't care about her....you don't care about her work schedule. keep track of what days she go into work it's not so hard....what kind of spouse doesn't know his wife's schedule nor cares? Why don't you care? Yer I can see why she think you are selfish. You care about you. What if something goes wrong or an emergency you wouldn't even know what to tell the authorities. I thinks your behavior is abhorrent.\n\nThis argument with your wife was dumb. It didn't need to happen. It's probably not even just about you taking too long in the shower...it's probably other things and other insensitive comments you make.

My wife and I use it together in the morning; I would find it strange to go in and close the door and expect her to knock before coming in.

His wife needs therapy.", "Yea that\u2019s why I chose to ignore it lmao. Very telling.", "I mean the rest makes some sense but the emphasis was on the escalator, and honestly that seems unreasonable.  For context we were not rushing anywhere on the bus, it was a weekend and we were going out, and we did not have any appointment or reservation to get to. Reading a lot of the comments here I will concede that I can take shorter showers, keep the door open when not showering, and be more considerate of her schedule. But I will definitely stick by my opinion that you should not run down a 200 foot escalator to catch a recurring bus, when you have nowhere that you need to get to. It's not safe. I think the people who disagree are being unreasonable.", "But that's the thing, 10 minutes is not really that long. I wouldn't expect an apology.\n\nShe said she'd also take a shower. According to OP she didn't say it needed to be in the next 10 minutes. He didn't rush as no one told him he needed to rush.\n\nShe assumed he'd be ready by the time she finished her coffee. That's on her, not him.\n\nAnd yes, if I needed to take a shower and my partner was still there I'd also just say \"are you almost done? I need to go as I need to leave for work\". It's what normal people would do \ud83d\ude01", "Sounds like she needs to learn how to communicate effectively", "I love it when people come straight out and say they're biased, as if it's a good thing and not a bad thing, lol.", "Was it solely because of a buildup of incidents like this? Any thing else you might recommend other than just divorce? Did you try marriage counseling and did it help?", "I think this could probably at least help in my situation because it's just us two in the house. It's clear I could spend less time in the shower as well", "Why is it OP\u2018s responsibility to know his wife\u2019s work schedule? She\u2019s an adult. She needs to use her words. She should\u2019ve said \u201cI only have X amount of minutes before I need to leave for work.\u201c \n\nBetter yet, she should\u2019ve told her husband the night before that she needed the bathroom. \n\nEven better, she should\u2019ve just gotten up earlier than her husband. \n\nLots of adult options.", "Men can't have long hair?", "Whys the door even closed for teeth brushing\u2026.\n\nYou guys have communication problem sharing a bathroom and a home", "But she TOLD YOU she needed to shower before work, right? You just didn't care?", "Well clearly it\u2019s not emotional manipulation, since it\u2019s failed to illicit a response that has caused him to care any more about her life. Love implies a standard of care that he himself is refusing to reach. If OP genuinely loved his wife, he would have taken care to listen to her and learn about her life (and her work). He had not done so. So it is HIM that doesn\u2019t seem to love her (further matched by his dismissive commentary throughout this post) \n\nLet\u2019s talk about emotional manipulation. Emotional manipulation is also being completely dismissing of your partner\u2019s emotional needs and then painting them as a harpy whenever they finally lose it. Over and over again.", "Except that\u2019s not what happened, and you can read OP\u2019s further comments to see how this issue is far deeper than just the shower issue. She knows his schedule, he openly admits to not knowing hers (your she doesn\u2019t know it line is not supported by the info) and yes, I think if your partner neglects to care about important details of your life, and is constantly trying to justify it - that is a valid reason to love them less. \n\nLove isn\u2019t some infinite resource that can withstand all things - this is not a storybook. Love can grow or can lessen at the actions of your partner.", "In the morning? When someone else needs to get ready? Yes it is. \n\nThere\u2019s no reason he couldn\u2019t have the door open after using the restroom and showering. Brushing your teeth, doing your hair, getting dressed, etc. do not require privacy in a reasonable marriage.", "He didn't need to stay in the bathroom after the shower. Get dressed in the bedroom. Or open the door so she know she can hop in the shower.", "Out of 4 paragraphs the last one briefly mentioning the escalator is somehow putting an emphasis on that? It\u2019s like one sentence out of 4 paragraphs\u2026\n\nNot how I would define emphasis. But ok", "Sounds like they need to have a discussion and learn how the other one communicates. After years together I can translate my partner's words and intentions very well and vice versa. However, I put time and energy into listening to what he needs and trying to be a thoughtful partner. He does the same. Not to say we didn't have to learn one another's patterns/communication styles but we did and had convos about it.\n\nAgain, I am fairly sure in her mind that she communicated effectively.", "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/she-divorced-me-i-left-dishes-by-the-sink_b_9055288/amp", "she did say exactly that. she said i\u2019m going to have a cup of coffee before i shower. that is 5-10 minutes before she needs to shower. telling him the night before she works every night is crazy", "Does the OP have long hair?", "Many people close the door while they shower. When they get out to do post-shower things, they don\u2019t make a point to open the door and then brush their teeth, the door just stays closed.", "IDK but I guess keeping the door open unless it really needs to be closed is valid advice", "Just because it failed doesn't mean it's not emotional manipulation.\n\nAnd it's quite interesting to me that your definition of emotional manipulation is very heavily tilted towards being a man manipulating a woman.", "My husband takes an hour. Does he piss me off? Yes. Do we sometimes argue about it? Yes. Do i love him less or would I say that to him? No. That's petty. \n\nEspecially if she had the opportunity to go in 1st but chose coffee.\n\nIf he had waited for her to coffee then shower before going in and ended up late himself, would she be at fault for taking her sweet time or him for not jumping in when he had the chance?", "The last paragraph has a different style. It has all caps \"YOU\" twice, and has \"so infuriating and selfish I can\u2019t even believe it\", when the earlier paragraphs are just neutrally trying to explain the issue and not a lot of adjectives.

It\u2019s a five second conversation: \u201cI have to be at work tomorrow at seven, so please let me shower before you.\u201d\n\nConsidering that she hadn\u2019t even poured herself a cup yet, your claim of five minutes for a cup of coffee is calling it really tight. 15 minutes is much more reasonable. He also told her he\u2019s going to take a shower first she didn\u2019t say anything. Again, is the time for an adult to use her words and say \u201cneed to be in the shower by a certain time.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019s out of the shower in 15 minutes, so she shouldn\u2019t have been delayed by more than five minutes, max. \n\nTbh, if she was in that kind of a time crunch; she should have shower first and THEN had her coffee.", "Well, maybe that's something that you should ask OP, before calling him an asshole.", "[deleted]", "I didn\u2019t define anything - nor did I name a gender. I gave another example of emotional manipulation, one that OP is taking part in. \n\nYou immediately added *male* to my example, when I didn\u2019t give a gender at all.", "Love how you just double down and STILL don\u2019t address the rest. I can see why your wife is fed up.", "I love this sub because where else do you see nonsense like this", "No wonder there are communication issues if you ignore the majority of the information and focus on one tiny thing.

TBH I wouldn't even expect my partner to knock before entering the bathroom (nor would I knock). We'd also have no problem using the bathroom while the other is in the shower (if I were to poop I'd try to wait just because of possible smells \ud83d\ude02).\n\nBut knocking on the door is another option.\n\nIf I'm in a hurry for whatever reason I let my partner know, I don't assume he knows...\n\nEdit: fixing autocomplete issues"]}
