{"id": 20834, "submission_id": "14lauzj", "title": "AITA for using the bathroom for 25 minutes and almost making my wife late for work", "selftext": "This morning my wife (28F) and I (29M) had an argument because I used the shower before her and she said she needed to be at work on time and I took too long. I used the shower for probably 15 minutes and was in the bathroom for 25 minutes. Before I got in, I said I was going to take a shower and she said she needed to have one too. She said she would take a shower when her coffee was done. At that time the coffee was still on the burner so I said I will take one first. She didn't say anything and I took the shower. After the shower she knocked on the door and said she needed to come in because she will be late. I said that is fine and she can come in earlier if she needs to. After that I said I'm going to work and \"goodbye\". I thought this issue was over and was trying to go back to normal. She refused to say goodbye back to me and I asked her if she was going to say goodbye and she said she won't. She said I should know what days she goes in to the office and what time she needs to be there (she has hybrid work), but I just said I don't know those details and she should have said something earlier if she needed something by a certain time. She also said I'm self-centered, and I feel like I was pretty calm until that point but then I got defensive. I said it is not my job to keep track of everything about her schedule and work around it, and that she's hypocritical because she doesn't know my schedule in terms of how long I spend in the bathroom and that I don't care if she knocks. After that she said that she doesn't care about me, and she wants me to leave faster because she doesn't want to see me. \r  \n\r  \nI feel like this is a recurring pattern: something minor happens and then she goes from 0 to 100 in no time, she gets extremely angry and says I am self-centered and now she \"loves me less\" in those exact words. This happens with things like us missing a bus that comes every 15 minutes because I wanted to walk slowly down a long escalator rather than run down it, and a few other things I can't remember exactly now. One time we were making food based on a complicated recipe and I asked her to repeat and clarify a step and she said \"I already told you!\" and I said to stop giving an attitude and she got extremely mad and said I'm annoying.\r  \n\r  \nSo am I being inconsiderate or self-centered, and otherwise how do you work this stuff out? Also, I feel like the typical advice of \"communication and understanding other views\" will not work here. She is someone who basically believes anything that causes an issue should never be spoken of again, and if I were to bring this up calmly and say how I feel it would probably start another argument. But again maybe I am just bad at resolving these things in a way that does not make her defensive.", "created_utc": 1687962146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14lauzj/aita_for_using_the_bathroom_for_25_minutes_and/", "score": 297, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Do you notice little things about her? Do you notice big things about her? Does she have to communicate every little thing to do because you don\u2019t put the effort in to pay attention?\n\nHer response is telling me that she isn\u2019t upset about just the shower, she\u2019s upset that you didn\u2019t consider she had to go in to work that day, and she\u2019s upset she had to tell you that in the first place. Perhaps she\u2019s being unreasonable in this instance, but the idea that it isn\u2019t your job to know her schedule tells me you simply don\u2019t pay attention to her or her life. That\u2019s likely what she\u2019s upset about. \n\nEvery example you provided  makes it very obvious she feels like you don\u2019t listen to her. And making someone late to a bus because YOU decide YOU want to walk slower is so infuriating and selfish I can\u2019t even believe it. You do seem inconsiderate and self centered, and she seems completely over it.", "I am a woman and let me decode this interaction for ya (at least within the parameters of my experience):\n\nYou: I am showering.\n\nWife: Ok, I need to shower too. I'll plan to do that once my coffee is ready. (In her mind she has just told you, I need to shower fairly soon and we both know I need to get to work. I've told you that I need the shower and conveyed that I need it within 10 or so minutes as that's the most coffee will take. I am letting you take the first shower as you're ready but in my mind I have told you that I need the shower very soon to get to work on time.)\n\nYou: In the shower for 15 minutes\n\nHer: At the 10ish minute mark, having finished coffee. Why is he still in there? I need to get ready and get to work. I'll try and do something else but I'm feeling a little anxious. Hope there's still hot water.\n\nYou: Finishes shower at 15 minute mark.\n\nHer: Thank goodness! I can just make it, I am sure he is going to open the door and rush out in a towel at any moment and say he's sorry for taking so long.\n\nYou: at the 20 minute mark doing your thing.\n\nHer: OMG, what is he doing? I will knock in 2 more minutes. It's rude to knock and harrass someone in the bathroom but I am so late and stressed now. Why is he doing this? I told him I needed to shower and I told him my timeframe. Why doesn't he listen? Why is he selfish? I hate being this stressed out early in the day. Ok, now I will knock.\n\nYou: at the 25 minute mark, all relaxed and happy coming out of the bathroom, surprised Pikachu face at her being stressed when she's probably been bottling up annoyance for at least the last 15 minutes.  \n\nYou seem pretty oblivious. Your wife isn't going from 0-60 in 1 second. You haven't listened, you've ignored her clearly stated needs (in her mind), and then you act surprised that she's annoyed and in a rush to get out the door. If you aren't saying, \"I'm sorry, I didn't realize when you needed to leave, can I help you get ready?\" she doesn't want to discuss this with you when she's tight on time and already stressed out. Your other examples aren't as clear but do show that you don't listen/pay attention and then act as though her being annoyed has come out of nowhere.", "YTA. No sense of urgency after wife communicated a sense of urgency is likely why she defaults to going from 0 to 100.

You are self-centered. I WFH and my wife works in-office. I defer to her on the shower times because she HAS to be somewhere, showered, at a specific time and I don't.

She also told you before you got in that she needed one and you took almost half an hour. It\u2019s about lack of consideration or thought for your partner. It can seem like things go from 0-100 but when you\u2019re repeatedly treated without thought or consideration it wears on you.", "YtA She went from 0-100 because you expressed how much you don't care about her....you don't care about her work schedule. keep track of what days she go into work it's not so hard....what kind of spouse doesn't know his wife's schedule nor cares? Why don't you care? Yer I can see why she think you are selfish. You care about you. What if something goes wrong or an emergency you wouldn't even know what to tell the authorities. I thinks your behavior is abhorrent.\n\nThis argument with your wife was dumb. It didn't need to happen. It's probably not even just about you taking too long in the shower...it's probably other things and other insensitive comments you make.

My wife and I use it together in the morning; I would find it strange to go in and close the door and expect her to knock before coming in.

All hell broke loose because my autistic (we didn\u2019t know this at the time) sister absolutely had to go in the bathroom before anyone else could. Even if it was just to use the toilet. So of course mum would always cater to her and I who literally has no reason to go upstairs bar for this has to go and finish her bathroom routine in the 2 foot wide toilet with no mirror because my sister couldn\u2019t go the toilet upstairs.

I can easily take 25 min in the bathroom.  The goal of a shower is to actually wash your ass right? Maybe a lot of people just stand under the water for a few min, I don't know.   Then dry off, maybe some lotion, put on your clothes comb your hair, and brush your teeth.  \n\nSo many comments are saying that this guy is not paying attention to his wife and he should know her schedule blah blah blah.  I do not see it that way at all, my husband and I do not have each other's schedules memorized.  I do not think that we should, we discuss our schedules with each other in the evenings so we know what is happening the following day. I never bother to try to know his schedule ahead of time, nor does he try to know mine.  This may not work for OP and his wife but they should be able to work something out to avoid these types of situations from happening. \n\n I do have to disagree with OP on one thing, communication always helps, and so does teamwork.   If she needed the shower in a hurry then that is what she should have said plain and simple.  How about \" Hey I have to be in the office this morning so could you please hurry\".  OP could have also asked her when he realized she had to go to the office what time she needed to leave and adjusted accordingly.   I am very much of the mind that marriage is 50/50.   If I know my husband and I need to leave the house at about the same time, maybe I will get up a few min early.  That way I do not feel rushed, and my husband does not have to cater to me so I am not late for work.  \n\nI also gather from the post that it is not just the shower issue that is the problem, the example of cooking dinner together is another way this woman expects him to be perfect and if he is not she loses her shit.  \n\nThe number of commenters that act like this man should be bowing down to his wife instead of them working together is shocking, to say the least.  Even more disturbing is the number of people that have defended the wife's mental manipulation.

A better way to say what you wanted to say was \"I'm so sorry, I didn't realize my time in the bathroom would delay you so much.
