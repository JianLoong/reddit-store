They will not be coming to visit Mother's Day weekend, and under no circumstances am I leaving my child overnight with ANYONE until he's at least toddling around. She was very upset with my decisions, putting my foot down, and got snippy with me. I told her, \"You don't have to like my decision, but you have to accept it, if not for me, for your grandson. I'm only doing what I'm doing for his well-being and mine as well.\" It's one small step to a better relationship/boundaries with her. I hope one day we can work things out, but step 1 is down and established. \n\nSo, I moved out and in with my husband last August, and life has been pretty great for us. We found out we were expecting our LO, who arrived on April 1st. \nI've always had a pretty rocky relationship with my family due to past experiences with them, but since we live 6 hours from them, they're making trips without telling us ahead of time, telling my husband and I that we don't visit often enough (and need to stay for a week minimum when we do visit), and that my son is going to grow up not knowing their grandparents. \nI never know how to respond to them because it gets under my skin how they keep butting into our lives while we're trying to get adjusted to having a new baby in the house. \nThey've went as far as trying to find a place to live here/trying to convince us to move; but my husband has 2 kids with his ex-wife, and as long as we stay in this state the kids will get free college from his Navy time. \nI always feel bad for snapping, but things just seem to keep progressing. They planned a trip for next weekend, but didn't tell me until now. I wanted to spend Mother's Day with my baby, but they're insisting that I should go out with my husband and leave my son in their care (which, I don't feel comfortable with just because of how they raised me, and I have bad Post Partum Anxiety.) \nAm I the Asshole?? Should I not be upset that they're inserting themselves into my new life and making me feel like a crappy daughter for not letting them have more interactions with their grandson?\n\nEdit: I posted this in a comment, but apparently, the title is confusing:\nI didn't give enough context, I guess. I was worried about going over the 3,000 character count. \nMy mom tells me that my son will grow up not knowing their grandparents. \nWhen I tell her I don't feel comfortable with them keeping him overnight (he is a breastfed baby, and I do have bad post partum anxiety), she says that I told her that she could keep him for a night, or my husband said it was fine, when in fact we both do not want them keeping him overnight. \nShe'll call me crying, saying it's not fair that we live so far away because my son is growing up so fast, and she doesn't feel like she'll ever get to experience his baby years.\nShe bought a good bit of the baby items we use, even though my husband and I told her not to and we would take care of it, and she'll use that as an excuse to see him. \"Well, I bought *this and this,* and you won't even let me come see him use it??\" (When I've literally sent her a million videos and photos of him using it.)\nIt just feels like she's manipulating me into trying to see my son.", "created_utc": 1683378874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/139mqh9/aita_i_feel_like_my_parents_are_manipulating_me/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should be doing everything to make this easier for you and instead she's gaslighting and boundary stomping. Is it PPA? Or is it you have had a traumatic birthing and PP experience? And, she's giving you a ton of reasons not to trust her.\n\nSo many sympathies. Trust your gut, hold the line, and do what's best for your new immediate family (LO and Spouse).", "Yep totally understand. We had a blue light babe as well. It can be scary when it\u2019s that high. \n\nKeep that baby with you, you\u2019re doing exactly what you need to with him. He\u2019s hardly been in the world two months. \u2764\ufe0f", "Now you're allowing a ridiculous reddit commenter to get in your head. Just stop and do what's right for you.", "Dude, I've had mastitis 3 times now due to being an oversupplier!! It takes a toll mentally and physically, but I have my mind SET on breastfeeding my baby. I'm still an over producer, and I have to pump, but we freeze the milk just in case I either dry up or go back in the hospital for something. It's insane what our bodies can go through.\nThank you for your kind words \ud83d\udc99", "I didn't have a traumatic birthing experience, but PP has definitely been a bit traumatic. I had a 105.3 fever when I got admitted to the hospital and couldn't even stand up because I was so delirious. When I went into the hospital, my husband had the baby, and I had to tell her \"NO\" because she was dead set on driving down to where we live to watch the baby while my husband stayed at the hospital with me. That was one of the first moments I realized that I'm just an excuse for her to get close to my LO instead of my husband watching him and bringing him up during the day. She never mentioned coming for me, only to watch LO while I was admitted. \n\nI'm learning how to say no, a skill I never had in life because they made me think I was obligated to them. It's a learning curve and challenge for me as an adult now, but with LO, I have to do what's best for our family.", "If she continues to give you grief by trying to use the fact that she gave you guys baby things as gifts, pack them up and have your husband return them to your MIL.  Don't give her any Lee-way.  You are absolutely NTA", "Of COURSE you want to limit access to your son. He's YOUR SON. You and your husband need time to meld all together into a family. That CAN'T HAPPEN if your parents are there all the time. \n\nLimit time. They can come on son's birthday. They can come for either Christmas OR Thanksgiving. They can come for Fourth of July. That's it! Or more often if BOTH you and your husband wish. It's not leverage, it's normal.", "Then stay home.  You don\u2019t need to travel with a newborn.  He is the primary concern right now.   \nThey don\u2019t need to come visit, either.  You need some time to focus on you and baby.", "You don\u2019t have to go. You don\u2019t have to agree to them coming over. You are entitled to some just you and your baby and your SO time. If you need permission this is it.  The time to stand up to them is right now.", "What's to be grateful for? You can't treat your own child like crap for years and expect them to welcome you to visit their child.", "NTA. Talk to your husband, make some decisions, communicate them to your parents. If you don't want your parents there Mother's Day weekend, then tell them they are not welcome that weekend. If you don't want to leave your LO alone with them, then refuse their offer.\n\nYou are the mama bear now. You need to do what you think is right for your core family - you, your husband, and LO. \n\nIt is okay to tell your parents \"No.\" Examples: No, you cannot come over next weekend. No, my husband and I will not be going out. No, we are not ready to make the trip to you with the baby. No, we will not stay that long. No, you cannot stay with us that long. (Don't try to argue with your mother: \"I appreciate your concern, but my answer is *no*.\")\n\nIf you aren't already in therapy, I recommend trying it. You should have support on a regular basis if you are dealing with your mother on a regular basis.", "NTA my grandmother never kept me overnight, we lived far away for years, yet we loved each other dearly and she was a really significant person in my life. Your mom's demands are way out of line.", "NTA\n\n> We found out we were expecting our LO, who arrived on April 1st. \n\nOh nooooooo that poor kid is in for a lifetime of april fool\u2019s jokes lol\n\nAnd congrats!\n\nAlso WOW that\u2019s not even been two months and your parents are already hassling you? Have you even healed from giving birth yet?\n\nYour parents are being overbearing and pushy. If someone shows up at your door unannounced to visit, they should be prepared to accept a no.\n\nBut to pull that when it\u2019s a six hour trip and the person you are visiting has a brand new baby? Absolutely out of line. It is reasonable for you to put a boundary in place that visits need to be planned - not something decided unilaterally by them.\n\nHow long you visit them is up to you, not them. \n\nI hope you are getting help for post partum anxiety, but even if that wasn\u2019t in play I think it\u2019s completely reasonable to say no because you want to spend mother\u2019s day with your new baby.\n\nYou\u2019re mom\u2019s FOMO (fear of missing out) is not your responsibility, nor should she be expecting you to upend your life for her. (And the lives of other people.)\n\nAnd jesus, I\u2019d be suprised if you didn\u2019t struggle with anxiety just based on the few examples here of your mom trying to guilt the hell out of you.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to say no.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to say \u201cthat won\u2019t work for me\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to push back on this notion that you living your own life is somehow not fair to *her*.\n\nYour baby isn\u2019t even two months and your mother sounds absolutely exhausting. And disrespectful - planning a trip without asking you about it first is her disregarding your life and your plans. Its her trying to dictate your schedule.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be really, really hard to say no to your mom. But it\u2019s a battle worth having. She\u2019s using your silence to get what she wants at your expense.\n\nI only lived closer than six hours to my grandparents after I was 19 - and I absolutely had a relationship with them. We\u2019d make big trips once or twice a year, and my parents would send me to stay with them a month over the summer when I was old enough that they were comfortable sending me on a plane by myself. (11.) I remember always getting cards and gifts on my birthday, even when we couldn\u2019t visit. And that was before texting and video chats.\n\nSo no, they don\u2019t need to be at your house in your pockets every month to have a relationship with your child.", "NTA", "What past bad experiences?", "That's a bonkers comment. \"Just because they abused you doesn't mean that they'll abuse your child. They might die soon! Blah blah blah...\"\n\nPeople don't automatically get better just because their children have kids. Just like they didn't automatically get better when they had their children. \n\nCould they have learned since their children were young? Sure. Do their children have to trust them with their kids? Nope.\n\nAlso the constant pushing for access to the grandchild (not to support their child) shows that they haven't learned at all. \n\nGood grandparents are a blessing. OP's parents are not a blessing.", "Also, your reading comprehension isn't great. This isn't her grandparents (not that your take would be logically sound then either) but her parents - her child's grandparents.\n\nThe kid is a month old. Exclusive breastfed. No one needs to have overnight access, least of all her parents who showed very irresponsible behavior when their own daughter was growing up\n\nAnd there is no excuse for gaslighting. It shows even more reason not to trust them with their newborn grandchild. Quite frankly, since you're defending it, it shows that you are not a trustworthy person either.", "My niece was such an oversupplier that she couldn't ever use up everything she had frozen, so she donated it to a woman in her mom's group that had adopted an infant. \ud83d\ude0e", "Drop the rope. You have a newborn and are dealing with PPA. No going to visit them until he's a year (and if you want to).

They never stay with you, they need to get other accommodations - especially while your routine gets settled.\n\nStop sending pictures to placate them. (Set up a family album that they can have access to, if you want.) They don't need to videoconference the baby if you don't have the time or desire - or set it up monthly if you want.\n\nAll communications through text from now on. You can't trust them to not pull a \"but you said XYZ\", then everything goes in writing.", "That's freaking awesome!!!

Nobody likes uninvited visitors and you have every right to your privacy. Putting down firm boundaries isn't mean. It's liberating. \n\nAnd next time she tries to guilt trip about the gifts, firmly say you will no longer accept her trying to manipulate you and make you feel guilty over your your reasonable boundaries. Make sure to do it every time. Boundary stompers will not stop until they get the message that they will no longer be tolerated, but it takes multiple times. \n\nTell her you can send the gifts back if she's going to keep bothering you about them. They're being selfish and not considering your reasonable requests. Good luck! NTA", "Your son is an infant.   He could spend a week with his grandparents without getting to know them.
