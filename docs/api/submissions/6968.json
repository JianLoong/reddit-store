{"id": 6968, "submission_id": "1086nu3", "title": "AITA for reprimanding my adult son and telling him to get over himself?", "selftext": "My son has two boys ages 16m and 12m. Their mom and my son's first wife died suddenly 10 years ago. My son and the boys were lost. Eight months later my son met a woman and fell very hard and fast for her. He admitted to his dad and I that he felt like everything could be perfect again. The boys could have a mom present and he could have a wife again. We warned him that it might not be that easy but he was so happy again and appeared to have lightened after meeting her so we tried not to say too much. His oldest son, for the sake of the post we'll call him Cole, did not take to my son's now second wife Emma very easily. My son and Emma married two years after his first wife died. Emma had lived with them six months prior to the wedding. The youngest, Jamie, started to call Emma mom almost immediately but he was so little with no memories of his mom. Cole was different. He did not want to call her mom and did not like the idea of her being his second mom. He was adamant he did not want her like that. \n\nIt became especially clear during the wedding that things would not go well. My son and Emma planned a small exchange between her and the boys, meant to be a sweet moment to celebrate the joining of the family, but Cole wanted no part in it and sat out while his brother and Emma took part. After that we suggested to our son that everyone could do with some therapy and he listened.\n\nIt's clear that our son has grown to resent Cole for not embracing Emma and being part of the family the way he wanted him to be. Their relationship is incredibly stained and Cole is polite but very distant with Emma. He treats her more like he does his teachers than he does the rest of the family and it angers our son. I have seen my son visibly frustrated when Cole calls her Emma or when he talks about his mom.\n\nA few days ago my son was ranting and raving about how Cole is a stubborn brat and how he will never be able to understand why he can't accept Emma as a mom too. He said that adoptive kids don't dig in their heels this way and refuse to accept a new parent, that most are so grateful to have someone. He said it's disrespectful to him, Emma and to Jamie. That it undermines the family they all want to have and Cole refuses to try. Also that he wishes Cole was more like Jamie. That Jamie handled things right. That Cole is disrespectful to him as his dad by not listening and he also said he finds it hard to look at Cole and feel the same as he does for Jamie because of all this. I reprimanded him for talking like that about Cole. I told him he needs to get over himself and accept his son, and find a way to accept that neither Cole nor Jamie's way is inherently right and it's about what's right for them as individuals. I also told him Cole can feel every bit of that anger and one day he will lose his son if HE can't accept the truth for Cole and let go of all this frustration. My son told me I will never understand and should not speak to him like he's a child.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673346865, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1086nu3/aita_for_reprimanding_my_adult_son_and_telling/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What your son and his wife are trying to do to Cole is nothing short of terrible. They should be ashamed of themselves. He remembers his mother and does not want her replaced. There are other important roles than that of a parent that Emma could play. Instead she stubbornly chooses to want to be mother, and your son stupidly supports her, when she could have chosen to be a reliable, close adult in Coles life.", "NTA. Your son is a terrible father.

A child wants whatever the child wants and doesn't understand that other people sometimes want other (conflicting things).  I DONT CARE THAT YOU HAVE WORK DADDY I WANT YOU TO STAY HOME AND PLAY WITH ME!  An adult understands that each person is an individual with their own wants/needs/desires and those must be respected.  \n\nThe #1 most reliable way to ensure that a child NEVER has a good relationship with a step-parent is to try and force them to have one.  \n\nWhat your son needs to understand is that from Cole's POV, he didn't just lose his mom, his mom was forcibly replaced.  He didn't want another mom, and now he has one.  Every time Jamie says 'thanks mommy!' Cole probably wants to scream 'THAT'S NOT OUR MOM ASSHOLE!'.  \n\nAnd if Cole is being a brat and undermining the family your son wants to create, your son should consider that Cole never wanted to create that family, so he has no reason to support its creation.", "NTA but your son is a massive one. He is resenting his own son for not complying with his perfect new family, and not forgetting about the mom he knew and loved.\n\nI agree you should not talk to him like a child, because I have children and they have way more heart and emotional intelligence than your son.

He must have no idea how many of them end up in therapy and have lots of trauma to work through eithers as children or young adults. If he truly understood it, he would also understand that he son needs more therapy. So his son can let go of the anger and have a more healthier relationship with his dad and stepmom (doesn't mean he has to accept her as a mom, however their current relationship is not healthy either). And he needs to accept that his son will never have the need for another mother. He might had accepted her, had your son taken more interest and time for his oldest child when he was still grieving instead of moving on so quickly and forcing another woman as a mother on to him.\n\nI think you worded it very well.

In the first place, eight months is a ridiculously short amount of time to expect a child to process the loss of their mother and accept a new person in their father's life. Your son should've pumped the brakes on his relationship with Emma and put Cole in therapy the minute it became apparent that he wasn't handling this well. However, he chose to press on and is now blaming a teenager for feelings he didn't understand and couldn't process properly as a young child.

The younger one obviously doesn't have much to process since he was too young, but Cole seems more mature about dealing with the past than your son.\n\nCole's attitude at least partially stems from the fact that your son replaced Cole's mother quite fast and then displayed an attitude of \"new mom's here, let's not bring up old mom again.\" Cole's mom should be a happy memory due to the wife and mother she was, the children she gifted your son and the memories she left behind instead of being treated like the equivalent of Voldemort whose name shall not be mentioned.\n\nSince I fogot it in my initial post: You did a great job at being a decent grandmother and mother.", "Can you at least let Cole know your door is always open for him?

It is sad for him that he didn't process his late wife's loss properly, but what is even more troubling is that he didn't think of the possible repercussions on his kids. He's now facing the consequences of his actions, quite frankly.\n\nI hope one day he wakes up and realises that this situation is his own doing. In the meantime, all you can do is be there for Cole and be the supportive presence that he needs in his life.", "We do and that looks different for everyone, which is something my son struggles to accept.", "I hope one day he will accept that.
