Their mom and my son's first wife died suddenly 10 years ago. My son and the boys were lost. Eight months later my son met a woman and fell very hard and fast for her. He admitted to his dad and I that he felt like everything could be perfect again. The boys could have a mom present and he could have a wife again. We warned him that it might not be that easy but he was so happy again and appeared to have lightened after meeting her so we tried not to say too much. His oldest son, for the sake of the post we'll call him Cole, did not take to my son's now second wife Emma very easily. My son and Emma married two years after his first wife died. Emma had lived with them six months prior to the wedding. The youngest, Jamie, started to call Emma mom almost immediately but he was so little with no memories of his mom. Cole was different. He did not want to call her mom and did not like the idea of her being his second mom. He was adamant he did not want her like that. \n\nIt became especially clear during the wedding that things would not go well. My son and Emma planned a small exchange between her and the boys, meant to be a sweet moment to celebrate the joining of the family, but Cole wanted no part in it and sat out while his brother and Emma took part. After that we suggested to our son that everyone could do with some therapy and he listened.\n\nIt's clear that our son has grown to resent Cole for not embracing Emma and being part of the family the way he wanted him to be. Their relationship is incredibly stained and Cole is polite but very distant with Emma. He treats her more like he does his teachers than he does the rest of the family and it angers our son. I have seen my son visibly frustrated when Cole calls her Emma or when he talks about his mom.\n\nA few days ago my son was ranting and raving about how Cole is a stubborn brat and how he will never be able to understand why he can't accept Emma as a mom too. He said that adoptive kids don't dig in their heels this way and refuse to accept a new parent, that most are so grateful to have someone. He said it's disrespectful to him, Emma and to Jamie. That it undermines the family they all want to have and Cole refuses to try. Also that he wishes Cole was more like Jamie. That Jamie handled things right. That Cole is disrespectful to him as his dad by not listening and he also said he finds it hard to look at Cole and feel the same as he does for Jamie because of all this. I reprimanded him for talking like that about Cole. I told him he needs to get over himself and accept his son, and find a way to accept that neither Cole nor Jamie's way is inherently right and it's about what's right for them as individuals. I also told him Cole can feel every bit of that anger and one day he will lose his son if HE can't accept the truth for Cole and let go of all this frustration. My son told me I will never understand and should not speak to him like he's a child.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673346865, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1086nu3/aita_for_reprimanding_my_adult_son_and_telling/", "score": 1371, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He didn't want another mom, and now he has one.  Every time Jamie says 'thanks mommy!'

He is resenting his own son for not complying with his perfect new family, and not forgetting about the mom he knew and loved.\n\nI agree you should not talk to him like a child, because I have children and they have way more heart and emotional intelligence than your son.

He must have no idea how many of them end up in therapy and have lots of trauma to work through eithers as children or young adults. If he truly understood it, he would also understand that he son needs more therapy. So his son can let go of the anger and have a more healthier relationship with his dad and stepmom (doesn't mean he has to accept her as a mom, however their current relationship is not healthy either). And he needs to accept that his son will never have the need for another mother.

Okay, not really, but I married a widower with a young son.  I am now the mother of adult sons, so I have thoughts \u2026. \n\nYour son may be anxious that his marriage to Emma remain happy, both for his own sake and because Jamie has bonded with her.  He may feel Cole\u2019s attitude is a lurking threat to that.  Obviously this way of thinking is unfair to Cole and is causing more harm than good.  However, I try to temper any \u2018hard truths\u2019 I say to my adult sons with acknowledgement that they are men of good intentions.  As much as your son needs a serious reality check, your son\u2019s intentions aren\u2019t evil.  He is however, blind to Cole\u2019s pain.  He obviously needs your perspective on this situation, so keep those lines of communication open.\n\nWe have a culture that is suspicious of step-mothers. There is nothing wrong with being a great step-mother.  Your son hoped Emma could be the \u2018new mom.\u201d  He could have hoped for something different and more realistic.  Step-parents can bring a lot to the table.  \n\nI have seen a lot of posters here say, \u201cShe\u2019s not his mother, he needs to just be polite but distant.\u201d  There is a lot of territory between \u201cpolite but distant\u201d and \u201cmy mom.\u201d  Emma is family.  It\u2019s reasonable to hope that there will be affection, loyalty, respect, kindness and even love between a woman and a step-child she has helped raise.  It can\u2019t be demanded, but it can be built over time.  Cole might have felt freer to build such a relationship if doing so were not tinged with the hope or expectation that Emma would ever be \u201cMom.\u201d  I wish that we had a name for step-mothers that didn\u2019t include the word, \u201cmother\u201d because it makes it harder for that relationship to be its own thing. \n\nAlso, Cole is a teenage boy.  Many boys that age (hopefully just for a phase) can\u2019t stand their own perfectly lovely mothers.  Parent/child relationships change as children reach adulthood.  It can be a painful process, even when (especially when?) the relationship has been close and loving.  There were days when, \u201cpolite but distant\u201d would have been wonderful with my sons.  This a normal part of a child becoming an independent person.  \n\nYour son needs to have a more imaginative idea of what a \u201chappy family\u201d can be - especially one with adult children, since Cole is reaching adulthood.  He needs to recognize the mistakes he has made and apologize for them, then rebuild his relationship with his son.  As you well know, one is a parent to a child for a relatively short time but then, God willing, is the parent of an adult for many many years, so all is not lost if he is willing to do the work.  If/when your son really recognizes how unfair he has been to Cole, he\u2019s naturally going to feel guilt and shame.

The difference is that Cole is actually a child, while your son is a grown man, and he needs to get over his **DELUSIONS** about his new family. \n\nAs you said, Cole and Jamie's perceptions aren't inherently wrong or bad. In fact, they make a lot of sense given their age differences when their biological mother passed. Your son needs to come to grips with **REALITY.** Cole has a mother, and she passed away. Jamie has a biological mother who passed, but has adopted a new one in his father's wife Emma. \n\nCole doesn't view Emma as a mother, nor should he have to. As long has he is respectful and thoughtful about her a member of his family, mother or not, then it shouldn't matter. How he and Emma conduct themselves as a guide/child relationship is up to the two of them, and your son's input is not needed to make those conditions. \n\nThat means if he wants his son and wife to play \"mother and child\", it won't happen unless Emma and Cole actually want that and consent to that relationship mutually. Your son's insistence otherwise will hurt the relationship more than foster it. \n\nWhat would be better is to give Emma and Cole a free space to express themselves, and to decide what they want, and to understand that anything outside of consent to a parental/child relationship is not a rejection, but merely a boundary of the relationship they can both find compromise in (Be that - Dad's Wife and Dad's son, Mother/Child, or Step-mom/Child, etc.) depending on the degree of separation and what makes both comfortable enough to interact and not be disrespectful.", "NTA.

And being adopted isn't a God send for many adopted people\n\nAnd we often forget that to be adopted means the child had to lose their family to gain the new one.

That's not objectifying of Emma, that's recognizing who's responsible for this conflict and who's job it is to fix it.\n\nWith you on the OP's son's lack of empathy."]}
