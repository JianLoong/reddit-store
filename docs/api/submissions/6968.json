Their mom and my son's first wife died suddenly 10 years ago. My son and the boys were lost. Eight months later my son met a woman and fell very hard and fast for her. He admitted to his dad and I that he felt like everything could be perfect again. The boys could have a mom present and he could have a wife again. We warned him that it might not be that easy but he was so happy again and appeared to have lightened after meeting her so we tried not to say too much. His oldest son, for the sake of the post we'll call him Cole, did not take to my son's now second wife Emma very easily. My son and Emma married two years after his first wife died. Emma had lived with them six months prior to the wedding. The youngest, Jamie, started to call Emma mom almost immediately but he was so little with no memories of his mom. Cole was different. He did not want to call her mom and did not like the idea of her being his second mom. He was adamant he did not want her like that. \n\nIt became especially clear during the wedding that things would not go well. My son and Emma planned a small exchange between her and the boys, meant to be a sweet moment to celebrate the joining of the family, but Cole wanted no part in it and sat out while his brother and Emma took part. After that we suggested to our son that everyone could do with some therapy and he listened.\n\nIt's clear that our son has grown to resent Cole for not embracing Emma and being part of the family the way he wanted him to be. Their relationship is incredibly stained and Cole is polite but very distant with Emma. He treats her more like he does his teachers than he does the rest of the family and it angers our son. I have seen my son visibly frustrated when Cole calls her Emma or when he talks about his mom.\n\nA few days ago my son was ranting and raving about how Cole is a stubborn brat and how he will never be able to understand why he can't accept Emma as a mom too. He said that adoptive kids don't dig in their heels this way and refuse to accept a new parent, that most are so grateful to have someone. He said it's disrespectful to him, Emma and to Jamie. That it undermines the family they all want to have and Cole refuses to try. Also that he wishes Cole was more like Jamie. That Jamie handled things right. That Cole is disrespectful to him as his dad by not listening and he also said he finds it hard to look at Cole and feel the same as he does for Jamie because of all this. I reprimanded him for talking like that about Cole. I told him he needs to get over himself and accept his son, and find a way to accept that neither Cole nor Jamie's way is inherently right and it's about what's right for them as individuals. I also told him Cole can feel every bit of that anger and one day he will lose his son if HE can't accept the truth for Cole and let go of all this frustration. My son told me I will never understand and should not speak to him like he's a child.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673346865, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1086nu3/aita_for_reprimanding_my_adult_son_and_telling/", "score": 3772, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What your son and his wife are trying to do to Cole is nothing short of terrible. They should be ashamed of themselves. He remembers his mother and does not want her replaced. There are other important roles than that of a parent that Emma could play.

He didn't want another mom, and now he has one.  Every time Jamie says 'thanks mommy!'

He is resenting his own son for not complying with his perfect new family, and not forgetting about the mom he knew and loved.\n\nI agree you should not talk to him like a child, because I have children and they have way more heart and emotional intelligence than your son.

He must have no idea how many of them end up in therapy and have lots of trauma to work through eithers as children or young adults. If he truly understood it, he would also understand that he son needs more therapy. So his son can let go of the anger and have a more healthier relationship with his dad and stepmom (doesn't mean he has to accept her as a mom, however their current relationship is not healthy either). And he needs to accept that his son will never have the need for another mother.

Okay, not really, but I married a widower with a young son.  I am now the mother of adult sons, so I have thoughts \u2026. \n\nYour son may be anxious that his marriage to Emma remain happy, both for his own sake and because Jamie has bonded with her.  He may feel Cole\u2019s attitude is a lurking threat to that.  Obviously this way of thinking is unfair to Cole and is causing more harm than good.  However, I try to temper any \u2018hard truths\u2019 I say to my adult sons with acknowledgement that they are men of good intentions.  As much as your son needs a serious reality check, your son\u2019s intentions aren\u2019t evil.  He is however, blind to Cole\u2019s pain.  He obviously needs your perspective on this situation, so keep those lines of communication open.\n\nWe have a culture that is suspicious of step-mothers. There is nothing wrong with being a great step-mother.  Your son hoped Emma could be the \u2018new mom.\u201d  He could have hoped for something different and more realistic.  Step-parents can bring a lot to the table.  \n\nI have seen a lot of posters here say, \u201cShe\u2019s not his mother, he needs to just be polite but distant.\u201d  There is a lot of territory between \u201cpolite but distant\u201d and \u201cmy mom.\u201d  Emma is family.  It\u2019s reasonable to hope that there will be affection, loyalty, respect, kindness and even love between a woman and a step-child she has helped raise.  It can\u2019t be demanded, but it can be built over time.  Cole might have felt freer to build such a relationship if doing so were not tinged with the hope or expectation that Emma would ever be \u201cMom.\u201d  I wish that we had a name for step-mothers that didn\u2019t include the word, \u201cmother\u201d because it makes it harder for that relationship to be its own thing. \n\nAlso, Cole is a teenage boy.  Many boys that age (hopefully just for a phase) can\u2019t stand their own perfectly lovely mothers.  Parent/child relationships change as children reach adulthood.  It can be a painful process, even when (especially when?) the relationship has been close and loving.  There were days when, \u201cpolite but distant\u201d would have been wonderful with my sons.  This a normal part of a child becoming an independent person.  \n\nYour son needs to have a more imaginative idea of what a \u201chappy family\u201d can be - especially one with adult children, since Cole is reaching adulthood.  He needs to recognize the mistakes he has made and apologize for them, then rebuild his relationship with his son.  As you well know, one is a parent to a child for a relatively short time but then, God willing, is the parent of an adult for many many years, so all is not lost if he is willing to do the work.  If/when your son really recognizes how unfair he has been to Cole, he\u2019s naturally going to feel guilt and shame.

The difference is that Cole is actually a child, while your son is a grown man, and he needs to get over his **DELUSIONS** about his new family. \n\nAs you said, Cole and Jamie's perceptions aren't inherently wrong or bad. In fact, they make a lot of sense given their age differences when their biological mother passed. Your son needs to come to grips with **REALITY.** Cole has a mother, and she passed away. Jamie has a biological mother who passed, but has adopted a new one in his father's wife Emma. \n\nCole doesn't view Emma as a mother, nor should he have to. As long has he is respectful and thoughtful about her a member of his family, mother or not, then it shouldn't matter. How he and Emma conduct themselves as a guide/child relationship is up to the two of them, and your son's input is not needed to make those conditions. \n\nThat means if he wants his son and wife to play \"mother and child\", it won't happen unless Emma and Cole actually want that and consent to that relationship mutually. Your son's insistence otherwise will hurt the relationship more than foster it. \n\nWhat would be better is to give Emma and Cole a free space to express themselves, and to decide what they want, and to understand that anything outside of consent to a parental/child relationship is not a rejection, but merely a boundary of the relationship they can both find compromise in (Be that - Dad's Wife and Dad's son, Mother/Child, or Step-mom/Child, etc.) depending on the degree of separation and what makes both comfortable enough to interact and not be disrespectful.", "NTA.

And being adopted isn't a God send for many adopted people\n\nAnd we often forget that to be adopted means the child had to lose their family to gain the new one.

Different situation but I have a adult stepson who calls me by my first name. I've never once asked him to call me Mom, he has 2 Mom's already. We get together as often as we can for lunch etc. Had I pushed myself on him I'm sure he'd steer clear and I wouldn't blame him. You can't force love.

I say this as an adopted person. It's a pretty big conversation right now in the community, mostly because the mainstream sees things the way your son does, but most of us don't like being told to be grateful because it could be worse.\n\nAnd finally, emotions are ALWAYS okay. Cole is a child. He was six when all this went down. Expecting him to latch on to a new mother figure immediately was doomed to failure, and that expectation is likely what is causing the distance now. He's locked in, because your son will call him out for not engaging, but also has probably lorded it over Cole whenever he did engage more, and that probably made him feel disloyal to his mother. Seeing what can only be described as his father abandoning the memory of his mom, he probably feels like it's his duty to keep a flame lit for her...which in turn makes any relationship with Emma dicey.\n\nNow behavior is another matter. While emotions are always ok, how we interact with those emotions can require adjustment. But it sounds like Cole is fine. Your son is the only one here who is the problem - you have to deal in reality, and all he's ever done is run away from reality and take it out on anyone who doesn't agree with him.\n\nMy sister is like this.

Honestly, I think it really does come down to Jamie not remembering his mother while Cole does and therefore doesn't want her replaced.

My brother (now 29M) and I (25M) were the same ages these boys were when we lost our mother. Our father had a few girlfriends here and there and even a second (now ex)wife, and I was always much more receptive to the idea of a maternal figure other than our mom than my brother was. I never got to the point where I would call them mom, but instead I would call them \u201cAmma\u201d which is mom in my father\u2019s language (we\u2019re first gen Americans). My brother, on the other hand, always stuck with calling them by their names, even when my dad married his second wife \u201cKatie\u201d. Katie tried to push to get my older brother to call her mom or amma or something similar, but my father was vehemently against it, and refused to ever let her even bring it up to my brother. She would make a stink about it (privately to my father) but he stood firm, even when she accused him of not caring about her or her feelings, etc etc. But you know what? That decision my father made to never let anyone pressure my brother or I into calling them mom, and his decision to make sure we would never feel pressure from him to do so either, probably could have been a make or break moment for his relationship with my brother, had it gone the other way. \n\nOP, please make sure this child knows how you feel, and make sure he understands that his father\u2019s behavior is unacceptable, and that his brother isn\u2019t more valuable or respectful or better just because he calls Emma mom.

The fact that Dad and Emma got married despite Cole's difficulty with the situation is a huge red flag for me. Jamie should be allowed to call Emma \"Mom\" if he wants to, but by the same token, Cole should not be forced to do so, and he has every right to talk about his mother. The poor kid probably feels really alone in all this - his dad is remarried and his little brother doesn't really remember his mom, so Cole probably feels like he's the only one who misses her. Being a teenager is hard enough as it is. Cole's having to deal with so much more. It's a shame that his dad can't see that. And good for you for standing up for him. Somebody's got to.", "It isn't always easy, especially for older adolescents to fully accept a new step parent.

He doesn't have the right to control who his dad falls in love with, or who he chose to marry, but your son should accept that every child deals with these matters differently. Jamie was younger, and possibly the more easy going of the sons. Cole might take longer to fully accept that he now has a stepmother, but he should also be required to at least be respectful, and obey his father, and his new stepmother as well. \n\nCole might never come to the point he thinks of Emma as being 'Mom'. But as he becomes an adult, perhaps he'll begin to understand how his Dad had every right to find a new love, and marry a new wife, to find happiness in his own life.\n\nI wouldn't call you an asshole, but talking down to an adult offspring as if they were still a child isn't helpful at all in this situation.

My mom doesn\u2019t expect us to and neither does he, me and the older siblings (18m, 14f) all have our Dads in our lives. I understand where the son is coming from. I\u2019ve had three step-dads, if my mom was trying to force me into calling the second two Dad I would feel so uncomfortable and would definitely have grown resentful towards my mom (first step-dad I did call dad because I was like 4ish when he came into our lives).", "NTA. sounds like your son wanted this fairytale happy ending and will do anything to get it. He did not want to be a single father which I don't blame him, but he can't expect his kids to basically erase their mom for his new wife because it would wrap everything up in a nice little bow. He doesn't seem to show any compassion for his sons feelings about losing his mom and not wanting to \"replace\" her.", "NTA whatsoever \n\nYou are sticking up for your grandchild and that\u2019s exactly what he needs. Your son needs to let go of whatever \u201cideal\u201d vision he has in his head. Life doesn\u2019t work like that. You can\u2019t expect a child to replace a parent they lost. Cole is probably resentful that it was so easy for his family to replace his mom. \ud83d\udc94\nYour son should be happy Cole is *at least* respectful, because it could have easily been the opposite. \n\nThank God Cole has you in his corner! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "OP even talked about in a comment that her son has a good friend who was adopted and, while he loves his adopted parents, calls them by their first names and uses mom and dad for his parents that passed away.", "I am surprised your son hasn\u2019t gone in and gotten rid of/destroyed everything yet.

I have a (step)dad, he met my mom when i was 9-10. Mom never pushed me to call him anything in particular. My sperm bank was looooong gone by then, save for the occasional birthday card....written in what looked suspiciously like my moms writing btw lol ( miss and love you mom!).....and my dad(step) was \"call me dave, call me dad, just don't call me late for dinner!\" \nI called him dad for fathers day the year after they got married. I was so scared, cause i believed he would leave as soon as I said it, like the sperm bank did. My mom passed two years ago, i spent xmas with my dad and his new wife, who's amazing. He never left after i called him dad, and I've never regretted it! Please u/sammiestayfly don't let your moms \"hallelujah finally\" attitude rob you of a dad, especially if you feel like you do. Tell him private, explain how you feel about what your mom did and how it put a bad taste in your mouth. But please don't punish yourself  like this. You definitely deserve a dad that loves you.", "After reading that, I'm not sure he thinks the kids have their own wants and needs separate from his.", "Not really, most single parents aren't looking for hookups. They're looking for a partner that will join them in raising their children.\n\nIn the same way, a single mom will date a guy and then judge whether if their relationship is to move forward the guy would be able to adopt some kind of paternal or older male family member persona for her kids.", "Mom of an adopted son (14) from foster care...one of the first things they reach you is that the kids will not necessarily be grateful. In fact, you are far more likely to be on the receiving end of a variety of nasty and mixed up feelings, because the kids have been through a lot and can't function emotionally. Frankly, expecting gratefulness is bullshit. Kids who lose parents (via termination of parental rights or death) shouldn't just \"be happy\", because someone else stepped up for them. They get to grieve. They get to decide how they see you, and you earn their respect over time and by showing up and being empathetic. Even if you do everything right by them, they still get to see you however they want, and they might still hate you.\n\nMy son doesn't call me mom, and he doesn't call my husband dad. And guess what? I don't care. (I did cry a little when I found out he referred to me as his mom to someone else, but he still calls me by my first name to me.) If he ever calls me \"mom\", I will know I've earned it. And if he doesn't, then I will still know I have done right by him and been the best mom I can be for him.\n\nYou are NTA.

Blending a family isnt easy or simple.\nTrying to force a parental bond will only ever backfire.

I'm assuming he remembers his bio-mom and cares for her. His father can't prohibit his sentiments.\n4.
