Maybe it's childish, but I agree. They could do this party the day befor, the day after.

Why can't they come to your birthday, just because there's an engagement party later?", "NTA\n\nYour step-brother is pulling some serious bull. And I suspect his girlfriend is going to have something to say after the proposal, as she's already clocked on that he's being a dick planning this housewarming on your birthday.", "NTA. There is just no way whatsoever that this wasn\u2019t intentional. He knows your birthday, had a year to know about your plans, and is doing something to overshadow your day. If you ever plan to marry, throw your engagement party on his birthday.", "It's an asshole move to schedule his housewarming / engagement party over your well established birthday plan.\n\nNTA for being upset that he did that but... you can just reschedule your kayaking trip to conflict with his wedding day and have an open bar in the kayaks if it bothers you that much. (obviously do not do this...)\n\nFamily are the friends you have no choice about having. Step family even more so. You are free to hold the grudge but will it make your life better in any way?\n\nEnjoy your birthday trip.", "NTA  \nIt sounds a lot like your brother is attempting to overshadow you on purpose, it seems like everyone but him would be ok with doing it on a different day", "Tell her it's an engagement party.

If you go, make sure to tell people what he's doing, NTA", "NTA\n\nFor the past 6 years, you've planned the same trip to celebrate your birthday with your friends and family which means it's basically become common knowledge at this point. When you approached your stepbrother about the conflicting events he withheld the fact that he would be proposing to his GF. If that's not malicious, then I don't know what is. As soon as it became a proposal it became a family affair that no one would want to miss. Even the girlfriend was willing to switch the date of housewarming and the stepbrother completely disagreed. With how underhanded he was in this situation, I refuse to believe this is the first time he's done something like this. It's an AH thing too, and the dad's nonchalance towards it just rubs me the wrong way.", "NTA. You scheduled way in advance,  sure he even had an invitation \ud83e\udee4", "NTA. Sounds like he is jealous of your kayaking trip tradition and wants to be take it away. Which is stupid, as he could have his party, without ruining your trip. He sounds very small minded and petty.", "NTA. He purposely planned this for your birthday. He clearly has issues with you.", "NTA.", "NTA. Your step brother is, though. So is your father, BTW. Your step brother deliberately chose this date - if it was mere coincidence, he'd have just switched the date of his party.\n\nI wouldn't bother going to his party. Invite your friends and have fun with them, instead of your family, if your family is going to enable that crap.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy your birthday party with those of your friends who will come.", "If your kayaking was rained out, why not immediately set up another party, this one for just your friends?\n\nNo family, so that SB and your parents don't get to come. They'll grouse and complain, which is all family members seem to do nowadays, especially on Reddit.\n\nIt could be the start of an era in which you go LC on your family. They deserve it.\n\nNTA", "YTA you do the same thing for your birthday every year, who cares if one year is different.\n\nAlso: we don't know if the step-brother had to schedule it that day for a specific reason.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's gonna hijack every one of your birthdays for an engagement anniversary celebration for the rest of your life.", "How charming. Did you confrot them? Your dad and/or your brother?", "If it was that special then his dad would've joined. Maybe his family feels obligated to go on the same kayaking trip year after year because it's his birthday and this year was a welcomed change. Which to me sounds like it, why else would his dad use the lame excuse that he didn't want to kayak during the day if the party and engagement was going to be in the evening.\n\nIf his friends are coming in from town etc, then it just allows him to pay more attention to them.\n\nAgain, him being mad does nothing but makes him look petty. And I guess you siding with him makes you petty as well.", "What does alpha'd even mean*\n\nI'll use it in a sentence. I just alpha'd your incorrect grammar by correcting it for you in a debate.", "Expected mental ability to cope with disappointment and change.

Thats why I invited you to type in your native tongue.  But not if you're Russian, because Russians are on my shit list.", "You're not wrong either, but there is no point getting more worked up over that... yet.", "Idk dude , what do you have against russians?\n\nAnd if i typed in my native tongue , most people here would not understand me (unless they used google translate , but well , most people would not take the time to translate it)"]}
