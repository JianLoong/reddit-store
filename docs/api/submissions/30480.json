We found one, and it's EXACTLY what I was looking for! The coat is not in pristine condition, but I didn't care. The price seemed reasonable, and I paid for it using my debit card.\n\nI got home and showed my mom the coat. She asked how much it cost. I told her, and she said that it was awfully expensive for a used coat. She asked if I could show her the receipt, so I did. She then asked if it was possible they charged me twice. I told her no, that I was fine with the amount I paid, and I was just happy to have the coat. She told me that she was just making sure that I had done the math correctly, since it's something I struggle with, and that I was keeping track of the money in my account to be sure there was enough for the trip my friend and I are going on in January.\n\nAt this point I was really starting to get annoyed! I told her, again, that I was fine with the amount I paid, and I still had enough for the trip (we've already booked our plane tickets and reservations). I told her that I appreciated her help, but there wasn't any issue, and could she please let this go? She gave a very reluctant-sounding \"Okay.\" I went to my room to lie down for a while.\n\nLater that evening, my mom told me that she had called the store asking if they were sure they hadn't charged me twice. Initially they told her that it did seem like I overpaid for the coat, so they issued a partial refund, but they then called back a few minutes later and said that they in fact had charged the right amount. They tried to cancel the refund but in case I got it, I would need to pay them back. I was pissed, and yelled at my mom that I told her multiple times that I was fine with the amount I paid, and she needs to respect my boundaries! She admitted that she should have listened, and that she would be the one to pay them back if the refund went through, and I could keep the money for my trip. I told her thank you, and thought that was the end of it.\n\nA few days later, I checked my account and saw that HUNDREDS of dollars (roughly four times the amount I paid) had been deposited into my account! I showed my mom, and she told me that I needed to pay it back. I told her that she had told me she would let me keep the money and be the one to pay them back. She said I could keep the money she thought they owed me, but not the additional money. I told her that I wouldn't owe this money if she hadn't meddled. She agreed that she was in the wrong, but it's nonetheless my responsibility, and the right thing to do. I reminded her that her reasoning for doing this was because she was worried I wouldn't have enough money for my trip, and now I have an additional $300, so mission accomplished for her!\n\nShe's insisting that I pay it back, but I feel she should keep her promise and be the one to pay, as I wouldn't be in this position if it wasn't for her.", "created_utc": 1699322138, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pjh79/aita_for_insisting_that_my_mom_pay_back_the_money/", "score": 1237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She says she's willing to let me keep the money that she thought they owed me but not the additional $300. I think she should keep her promise and pay back the money, especially since I wouldn't be in this situation in the first place if she had respected my wishes when I told her I was okay with the amount I had paid for the coat.
