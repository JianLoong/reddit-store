Always after they set off alarm bells that we weren\u2019t being told the truth.", "yes\n\nthat is called a healthy approach to sexuality\n\nthe children dont need to tell about ir just because but its better if they know they can come to you as a parent if whatever issue came up where they could use input or help", "What happened to boundaries is teenagers having sex in cars or outside\n\nI'd actually be kinda nervous because cops don't always give them the polite knock and have a nice night that they give to straight kids. Don't be surprised if your 16 year old gets arrested by some overzealous cop", "would you rather your child and their sex partner go and have intercourse whereever else they find a place to do so or in the safety of your home where you wont have to worry about something bad happening to them? because forbidding them to have sex at home wont stop them from sex but force them do it elsewhere", "*People who are LGBTQI+ are not abnormal!*", "Did you hide a relationship?", "Or because he wasn't ready to come out.\nMaybe he was scared of how his father would react.\n\nSeems OP didn't even know his son was in s relationship, there's a reason for that", "Surely talking should come first not straight to looking through their devices? Just saying hey about your friend I have noticed some things about when your talking with him, how you talks ect and nees to ask is he your boyfriend? It's fine if he is I just want you to be honest with me", "Redditors think free range parenting is the only way and a child could not possibly just lie for no reason..I was a child recently, we lie for no reason. Your patience is astounding and I agree with you.", "Well your initial comment said they should have zero expectation of privacy not 'if I was legitimately worried and they were hiding things I would ask to see their phones' so that is what I responded to. Teenagers should have a certain aspect of privacy and trust between parent and child in the case it just sounds like son wasn't yet ready to come out", "Lol OK. They can have a healthy sex life after they're grown.  They'll be fine if they don't lose have sex before 18.", "Not coming out to a parent is not lying.", "I have kids and will violate their privacy if I\u2019m worried enough for their actual safety, but there should definitely be conversations first.  \n\nSnooping should be a last resorting, not something you do because you overheard a nickname.", "I have 3 kids, one of whom is an adult teen. No way would I have gone through her phone when she was 16. At no point did I say that a parent doesn\u2019t have a say in who stays overnight, my point was that a conversation is better than violating privacy. It\u2019s disgusting that you believe that a 16 year old has a minimal expectation of privacy, literally disgusting.\n\nOMG. You have a toddler. Jog on with how to parent a teen on the cusp of adulthood!", "Because he wasn't ready to come out perhaps?", "I sincerely doubt the out of town internet boyfriend is sneaking off with OP's son somewhere to have sex outside the house.", "This is similar as to why my dad let me go to my partner's house who lived next door and stay overnight when I was a teenager.   \n\n as I was doing it anyway - and climbing in his bedroom window from a distance that could cause serious injury if I fell.  Doing it two times a day minimum.\n\nHim saying no, would not have stopped me climbing in. They'd be unable to monitor it (I'd been doing it for a LONG time before they found out).  It was safer in all the ways, to allow me to just use the front door.", "I didn't have a substantial one as a teenager, I obviously hid sexual and romantic encounters from them. I talk to my mum about my relationship/sex stuff (to an extent) now, but didn't as a teen. And my mum was very honest with me early on about how she lost her virginity when she was young, so it's not like I feared judgement from her. I was just a stubborn teen who didn't want to tell my parents everything", "Sometimes kids just lie because they don't like the rules. We all had those friends with parents who were way cooler and more lenient and wanted to be able to do that stuff ourselves.\n\nThere's not really enough information to say the kid is in a bad spot. Just based on the post, it seems like he would have nothing to be afraid of.\n\nOP should have had that conversation with his son, bringing up what was overheard, instead of going through the phone, though, I think.", "It doesn\u2019t matter WHY he lied- he LIED period. That alone is enough to uninvite him .", "There's a huge difference here. If he's not ready to come out it's completely fine, but it is obvious that he didn't tell because he wanted to escape the rules \n\nDating and keeping it hidden because you're not ready? Fine. Brining the partner to your house so you can make out and spend time as partners but introducing him as a friend? Lying \n\nAnd it would be the same if it was the daughter bringing her bf but introducing him as a friend \n\nBottom line, coming out has nothing to do with this situation", "So a normal response to unready or afraid to come out is to lie so you can spend thanksgiving together?", "Of course- but when a teen chooses to continue to lie- trust but verify applies. We ALWAYS asked and discussed- if the lie persisted- trust but verify was the rule. Our kids all knew it- tell the truth- we may disagree but hear your viewpoint out. If you are correct- then we would change our position. Lie about it- the rules and consequences stood.", "Thank you- free range parenting and trying to be best friends of your CHILDREN doesn\u2019t work well. There is a time for friendships later as they become adults- they need rules, BOUNDRIES, consequences-", "Of course teens lie for no reason but in this case it looks like son didn't want to admit things yet coming out isn't always easy its nerve wracking", "I get that.\n\nBut the fact that OPs reaction to their suspicions was to snoop instead of talk to their kid is very telling.", "If he hid a relationship from his parents there's an important reason behind it", "If he hid a relationship from his parents there's an important reason behind it", "The reason absolutely matters.\nUnless you're the type of parent that thinks they can do no wrong, will never apologize to your kid, and cares more that your kid obeys you rather than trusts you.\n\nI rather be the type of parent my kid comes to for help", "Why would a kid who trusts their parent hide a relationship from them?", "I didn't say it was normal, i said OP went about it the wrong way \n\nOP could have asked, but chose to go behind their kids back", "But this OP didn't do that he noticed flirty behaviour didn't talk to son and imediately choose to look through the phone that's the difference here I believe :)", "You are ASSUMING you know why he lied- perhaps it\u2019s as simple as he was trying to get over on his father and not follow the house rules", "His dad damn near looked him in the face and said \u201cno boyfriends\u201d, not like \u201cyou\u2019re a shameful homosexual get out of my home\u201d. I also kinda agree with the romantic partner thing, my sister is almost 40 and STILL she acts like a total toolbag when she brings her husband, family time bruh", "Coming out isn't easy some teens get disowned, thrown out etc", "Yeah I don't necessarily think snooping was the right course of action, I just don't agree with the notion that having a good bond with your kids means they won't hide anything from you. Maybe I was just a sneak \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This kind of insistence on something being wrong and refusing to accept that sometimes there's not a great reason for lying can be just as problematic coming from a parent. \n\nThere's not always a great reason for stuff. Sometimes it just is.", "You really missed the point here. It doesn't matter, teen maybe isn't ready to talk about his relationship, that doesn't means it is parent's fault\n\nIn this particular situation, he hid the relationship in order to escape rules, period", "Maybe that is why talking before snooping would have helped because then if he continued to lie he would have every right to look further into it. Also caps lock isn't needed I read just fine x", "The absolutely was being sneaky I never denied this but talking to your kids should always be the first option before going through their things x"]}
