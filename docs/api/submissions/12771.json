She just bought a condo and asked if my husband and I wanted to see a movie at the 21+ theater by her place then she'd make dinner at hers. We have a toddler, so we were pretty excited to have some adult time.\n\n\n\nWe went out Saturday and saw the new John Wick movie, had a great time drinking beer, catching up, and messing around in the reclining seats and shit without worrying about having to censorr our language for toddler ears. The issue started when we got back to her place and she started making dinner.\n\n\nShe was making pasta and salad. I brought a homemade strawberry cake because that was my friend and I's \"thing\" when we lived in the dorms. We didn't have access to a kitchen so whenever I'd go visit family or friends for a weekend I'd always make this strawberry cake to bring back to the dorm to eat together and binge watch movies all night. \n\n\n\nShe waa making dinner and everything was good until she drained the pasta directly into the sink. Not using a colander or anything, she just put a different stopper in her sink so the pasta wouldn't go down the drain but the water would drain. To her credit, the sink looked clean. Neither my husband nor I wanted to eat her dinner after that because we were pretty grossed out. I'm not one to mince words but I also didn't want to be a dick about not eating the meal she prepared, so I was struggling with how to tell her we weren't going to eat the pasta. This is what I remember saying to her and I *think* I didn't have too harsh of a tone, but take this with a grain of salt, \"We've had a great night with you and I missed you so much, but we don't feel comfortable eating the food you made because you drained your pasta directly into the sink instead of using a colander.. I know it's a new place so your sink is probably clean and you haven't unpacked all of your kitchen stuff, but we still don't feel comfortable. Can we take you out to eat instead?\"\n\n\n\nShe responded by saying she doesn't own a colander and her dad would always just drain pasta directly in the sink. She also said we must think she's poor for offering to take her out to dinner instead of eating the food she made. I tried to clarify that we didn't invite her out to eat because we thought she's poor but she cut me off and said we should leave if we were so disgusted by her. We awkwardly left and ever since she's been texting me that I'm a shitty friend for being classist (she grew up poor and in and out of foster care, my husband and I grew up comfortably middle class) and that if I'm so worried about her gross food I should buy her a colander and apologize if we want to stay friends. I haven't responded to her because I'm not sure how? Both my husband and I apologized when we were leaving her house but I'm not sure much more we can do.

For smaller portions, sometimes I just use the lid and tip it very slowly. \n\nMy sink would never be clean enough to eat pasta out of it. Especially imagine if while draining, some of the water is in the sink drain and potentially all the bacteria from that is now mixed with the pasta/water that is chilling in the sink. \n\nNo sir. I am even careful while using a collonder to let the water drain a bit before pouring more, so the water in the sink never fills up to touch my pasta.. drain water. Yuck\n\nNTA", "NTA, I understand why you\u2019re friend was embarrassed and upset, but now she knows that others do not consider this sanitary. The situation sucks. Colanders can also be had for a couple of dollars either at a dollar store or thrift store, it\u2019s not like you turned down, coffee because you only drink brew made in $1000 coffee makers.", "NTA. Even if the sink was cleaned, some cleaners like bleach etc are absolutely not ok mixing with food. Even if there wasn't leftover cleaning supplies or raw chicken juice, I'd still be absolutely grossed out. And it's not classist to strain pasta with a colander. They sell them at dollar stores and Ikea. You usually see them in every kitchen! I use mine all the time for things other than just pasta like to put the potatoes in as I clean off the skins, rinse beans or berries in, drain fat off browned ground beef etc. There's a ton of things that were messed up in our childhoods that we find out aren't normal or healthy as we get older.  She probably just feels bad she didn't realize that it wasn't normal and is lashing out.", "Good lord NTA. I agree with you that this is disgusting. My BIL fills up the sink and washes salad leaves in it and I can\u2019t eat it because like what else was in that sink? The sink pasta is a hard no for me.", "NTA.   Draining pasta using the sink strainer is disgusting.

Gagging just thinking about it.  A sink can look clean, but unless it's been disinfected/boiling water, oh never mind - it's just gross.  Did she put sauce on it after the water went down the drain?  So gross.  I would not have eaten it.  \n\n If you care about her, then buy her a nice colander and apologize.  How to apologize?  Just tell her that you are very sorry for hurting her feelings/offending her.  It was not meant as a personal attack, but you understand she took it as an insult.  You care about her friendship and want to move forward.\n\nThe ball will then be in her court.", "NTA. At. All. Ew.

And probably NAH.\n\nYou were honest and tried to be accommodating.  Obviously, you touched a nerve and her reaction was amplified; perhaps she has been class-shamed in other relationships.  But your and your husband's health concerns were valid (even a clean looking sink can harbor harmful germs or chemicals).\n\nGive it time.  One lesson of growing older is that some of our friendships from the teens and twenties do fall by the wayside for any number of reasons.

Explain that while this might be normal for her, it is not normal for most people and few would be comfortable eating it. It has nothing to do with income and whole about being hygienic.

Please let me make it up to you later.\u201d Later on, like in passing, two weeks from now, \u201cI noticed you didn\u2019t have a colander, I picked up this adorable one up from Williams Sonoma cause it was on sale. I got me one too, I needed a new one.\u201d\n\nYou kinda, I don\u2019t know, chose poorly in the moment. Just my two cents.", "I think NAH. This is the way she\u2019s always done it. It feels gross to you, but not to her. It\u2019s not really *wrong* per se. Some people eat food dropped on the floor, some don\u2019t. Some cut the mold off cheese, some don\u2019t. There are levels and we all have our standard of \u201cnormal\u201d.

Please let me grab you a beer and boil a fresh batch real quick? Oh there's no more? Look let me take you out. Feel free to laugh at me with my husband\"\n\nIt's a gross and unhygienic thing but with many trivial ways for you to have fixed it without embarrassing your friend.", "ESH or NAH, I can't decide (sorry bot!)\n\nI would have been grossed out by that, but I would probably have just eaten the pasta. It's not gonna kill you, is it? I would have eaten it out of politeness and then gossiped about it on the way home. But I'm avoidant and British, so...\n\nIt's not right that she threw class in your face, bc colanders are cheap as chips. I don't think that's a fair point. Her better point is the 'my family did it this way'. That makes sense. Now, my mom used to feed us raw bits of sausage, and it didn't take me long to understand, upon reaching adulthood, that this is very gross and should absolutely not be done, ever. She should know better and she can afford a colander.\n\nNevertheless, think you could consider apologising / reaching out to mend things purely because this is a stupid issue to fall out over.\n\nETA: I see you have apologised. All you can do is say 'please can we make amends? I don't want to fall out over a colander.'  If she stays mad then that's her choice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Doesn\u2019t matter how close, in my opinion. \n\nThat said, I do recommend you give some thought here to this not being all your fault. Treating her as an equal includes expecting her to own her actions. She went too far, granted likely out of embarrassment, and you clearly feel this was out of character, but that doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t also owe you an apology for taking what was an uncomfortable moment and turning it into an attack on your character.\n\nApologize first, honestly, but only for what you actually did wrong (that is, not eating the pasta wasn\u2019t the problem, how you communicated was). Give her a moment to process that and then expect that she\u2019ll be a mature and loving friend by also owning up to her misstep.

Seriously do some research.\n\nEdit: Also I just looked it up commercial food prep \"wash sink\" was only allowed for food prep and you weren't allowed to wash dishes in it and it's not directly connected to the sewer system for the exact reason I'm talking about.
