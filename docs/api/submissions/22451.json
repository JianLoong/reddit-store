Sounds like he took after you and got started in the family way around 17. Did your parents or in-laws look after the kids overnight for YOU?", "4 kids all under 3?

After all, HE chose to have 4 kids before age 21, before getting married even.  Kudos to him for sticking around and caring for them, but they are ultimately HIS and his woman's responsibility alone. \n\nYour wife shouldn't be throwing shade either.

You're saying you love your grandkids and you're acknowledging your son works so hard, it wouldn't have hurt for you to watch the kids just to help your son spend quality time with his fianc\u00e9. Especially since you had no special plans. You should've also asked your wife before turning him down because she was happy to look after them. \n\nSo NTA but this was still an inconsiderate move.", "Four kids at age 21?! \ud83d\ude33", "NAH. While I think that you should probably have discussed this with your wife, who does have valid point about your son needing a break if he's falling asleep visiting you, first before refusing, it wasn't unreasonable to say no. \n\nYour son should have planned this out a bit better, though it is possible he didn't know he would have time for the outing till the day itself. He accepted your no and has been clearly working pretty hard so no asshole title for him either.\n\nMaybe sit down with your wife, call your son and see if you can make a plan for next week. Would also give you the time to figure out if you're missing anything and also plan something fun to do with the kids.", "NTA\n\nIt is you house and you said \"not this week\" implying another week would be good. Wife overreacted", "NTA. You didn't say no in general. You said no because it's last minute and a lot of work to set up. Four under 3 is soooo hard! And I'm baffled where you all live that he can even afford to have that many kids at 21. Please tell me there were surprise triplets in there.", "NAH If Grandma wants to watch the grandkids, she can do so at Noel's house. I'm also kinda curious as to who named Noel? No judgment.

Hello Reddit. My (38m) son  Noel (21) moved out a couple of years ago and lives in an apartment that I help him pay for. (No big deal, I'm happy to do it.) He has four wonderful children with his fianc\u00e9e. He works hard and attends night classes, takes good care of his wife-to-be and kids, and still makes time to visit me and mother when he can (he'll accidentally doze off every time, but hey it's the thought that counts).\n\nYesterday he asked me if I minded if the kids stayed over at my house overnight. He wanted to take his  fianc\u00e9e on a nice date because it's been a long time since they did anything alone together. Now, I love my grandkids and have babysitted on occasion before, but they're all under 3-years-old and can be a handful. I wasn't really feeling up to it especially on such short notice, so I said not this week. Noel was kind of miffed but said he understood.\n\nThe real blowback came from my wife, who said she would've been happy to have our grandkids over and that it was selfish for me to say no when I know Noel has been working so hard. It's true that I didn't really have anything special planned that night, I just wanted to relax for a while and maybe go for a stroll in the backyard. Was I being too selfish, as my wife says?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Let your wife know though next time because she may have been more bothered that you didn't discuss it with her.", "NTA I guess - 4 young kids is a lot - but makes me so grateful for my wifes parents who are always thrilled to take the kids for a night lol. \n\nMy dad and step mom would lean more towards your perspective and my siblings and I talk all the time about how much of a bummer it is that they are like that.\n\nI'd go over it with your wife next time because she seems to be on board with shouldering the load, and it really means a lot.", "Having 4 kids by 21 aside, NAH.
