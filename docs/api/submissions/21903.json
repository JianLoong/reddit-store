My plan is to just stay home and catch back up on things and explore the town. Not much.\n\nAnyhow, I was at work yesterday and everyone was talking about the vacations they've had or will be going on. Then I brought up mine will be starting in about two weeks. So some guy(20m) asked when it will be. I told him when. Then he asked what my plans were. I told him what I told you. Then he says that I am basically not taking a vacation. He said he tried asking off for his birthday a week ago for the 24th but was denied. So everyone has basically figured out it was because of me asking of those days before him.\n\nI thought nothing of it. But everyone started pressuring me to take back my vacation since I'm not going to be doing anything with it, and this will be his 21st birthday and he should be able to get drunk and enjoy it. I refused, but now my team has been acting distant with me today and someone even commented behind my back I'm not acting very nice right now.\n\nI don't feel like I'm being the asshole but I won't to ask the community.

Request your time off when you want it as early as possible or it will be gone.  He asks for a High season day off 1 week early?  I get that it's his 21st birthday, but why ask 1 week before?  Did he just get the letter informing him what day he was born?  The fact that you plan to take it easy and explore town IS a VACATION.  Is birthday boy asking for the day to fly to some resort for a vacation or drink at a local place and sleep it off the next day? How dare they say you are not taking a vacation!!  Can't control the folks at work being haters though, that is a universal constant.  If you traded a day, that's up to you, but you have no obligation.  Enjoy your time off from work (In my world I call that a vacation).", "NTA\nYour time off is exactly that, Your Time. You asked early because you need the time off, full stop.

Any of your coworkers giving you grief could step up and offer to cover the birthday boy\u2019s shift for him instead of badgering you to sacrifice your vacation plans.\n\nThere is an easy way to get these AH people off your back. Tell your coworkers that they\u2019ve convinced you, what you had planned wasn\u2019t really a vacation. So now, you\u2018ve booked yourself a trip, and you will be out of town the entire week, having a \u201creal vacation\u201d, and they can stop pestering you about dude needing to get wasted for his birthday. If they ask where you\u2019re going or whatever, tell them you\u2019re not telling anyone your plans because you don\u2019t want to be disturbed.\n\nThen, take your time off as scheduled, ignore any attempts at communication from anyone you work with, and enjoy your lovely stay-cation at home fully. When you get back to work, if anyone asks about your trip or wants to see photos, etc. just say \u201coh, my plans didn\u2019t work out so I didn\u2019t go. Anyway, how was your week?\u201d", "NTA.

So that's why the team is being pretty assholish to me. He put it off too late and now a bunch of them is going without the birthday boy.", "Yeah it\u2019s not like he didn\u2019t know his own birthday was coming up", "I just found out literally an hour ago a few of the guys planned ahead and asked off for two days. The guys plan was for the 4 of them to go on a road trip getting shit faced drunk. They have a designated driver. But the birthday boy forgot to ask off until it was too late. So I think that's why they're being assholish to me.", "I grew up in the 70s and my family did staycations long before the term ever came into being.

It's mostly just those 4 guys because of reasons I explained in other comments. The rest of the crew is cool.", "Lol. I know, right. Once September hits, all time off requests are usually denied until after January 1st. You have to ask off well in advance for those months. It's just when we're all the hardest hit.

Stick to your plans! Resting is a great plan. NTA", "If that\u2019s the case then, he\u2019s too late as well.  Even if you cancelled, the policy would dictate that he didn\u2019t ask for it well in advance.", "Right? Like on what planet is it anyone else\u2019s job to remind you to take your own birthday off lol", "Since I've already asked those days off for my vacation, there's little difference between me taking it off for my vacation or my coworker. So in theory he could get those days, UNFORTUNATELY management has another stupid policy. If you ask off for a block amount of time off, such as my wee off,, I can't just cancel one or two days, I have to cancel the entire vacation week. Unless it's under extreme circumstances which management does not think this is. So I'd have to cancel my entire week so he can get two days off, and then put in another request for something like September at the earliest."]}
