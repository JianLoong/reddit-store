Since my Dad\u2019s mistress is old fashioned she would always criticize me for not cleaning and cook for my brothers and criticize my mom for not doing whatever my dad say to her (waiting on him hand and foot), she then says how my mom would never find another man for the way she looks since she doesn\u2019t have a slim body (this bitch is really talking shit about my mom\u2019s looks when she looks like a black version of those ugly ass witches from hocus-pocus, what a downgrade yikes!) then to me about no man wants me for my rude behavior and my hobbies.\n\nLast months she and my dad announced they\u2019re getting married and to celebrate my dad decided to have dinner with my and my siblings to get to know my dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9. I honestly didn\u2019t want to good because the homewrecker would criticize me again but my mom made me to make peace, so I reluctantly went. When we had dinner my dad told his Mistress that I\u2019m graduating college soon and then she criticized me again due to me being in college and riding a motorcycle to school. \n\nShe stated it isn\u2019t lady like for me to ride a motorcycle and how my mom failed as a mother to raise a proper young lady, then I had enough, this lady can talk crap about me all she wants but when she does it to my mom that where the line is crossed, so I snapped and told her \u201cwell it\u2019s also isn\u2019t lady like to be a home wrecking bitch and also doing it with your late husband\u2019s MARRIED brother but yet you still did it\u201d I honestly knew I took things to far cause she got out the restaurant crying and my dad was yelling at me for insulting his fianc\u00e9 and bringing up her late husband.\n\nSo after dinner was over my dad demanded I apologize to her and while my mom appreciates me for standing up for her she did think I took things too far and I should apologize to her. My siblings on the other hand thought it was hilarious and said she had it coming. So am I the asshole for what I said to my dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9, cause now I\u2019m starting to feel a bit guilty.\n\nEdit: To clarify yes I know the mistress is technically my aunt but she used to live in another country and it would only be my uncle who would visit the family since they used to live half way across the world from my family and it would take a long time and planning to visit my family so she would insist on staying behind in order to save money and cause she hated traveling a lot. It wasn\u2019t until my uncle death that my dad and my aunt had the affair since my dad had to fly to the country where my aunt used to live since my uncle\u2019s will was signed to my dad and aunt 7 years ago, so me and my siblings knew nothing about her since she never visited us. It wasn\u2019t until last year where she got her US citizenship to move to the US cause of my dad where she then started to get to know the family. It was only last year that I ever met her and decided not to call her my aunt since I was already embarrassed enough about what my dad did since i don\u2019t want other people to know that she was my aunt.", "created_utc": 1694216774, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16dqaao/aita_for_what_i_said_to_my_dads_fianc\u00e9/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell your Dad you'll apologize when both he and she apologize for cheating on your mother and breaking up your family, and when she specifically apologizes to you for insulting your mother and yourself. You are correct, it is more unladylike, and far more immoral (which is more important) to help a married man with kids break up his family than it is either to attend college or ride a motorcycle. It is also immoral and unladylike, Stepmom, to insult someone you yourself have wronged, as well as to try to parent the child of a marriage you helped break up with your immoral and unladylike behavior, as if damaging their childhood and family security was a gift you gave them instead of an injury.\n\n(Sleeping with her late husband's brother would not have been wrong if he hadn't been married, though. In my opinion, anyway.)", "100% NTA. She deserved that and more.", "Your siblings were right to think what you said is hilarious. FAFO is what they say in this sub and this is what happened. She\u2019s dissing your mom to make her feel better and that\u2019s wrong.  You do you and ignore that noise. NTA.", "NTA\u2026. She found out", "NTA\n\nYou just stated the truth. Sometimes the truth hurts.", "NTA, you are my hero and if my daughter defended me that well I would be very proud.", "NTA whatsoever. This is exactly why they say people who live in glass houses shouldn't throw rocks. She f$cked around and found out. It's funny that your Dad didn't demand she stop criticizing you or your mother but is quick to demand an apology from you. I'm siding with your siblings.", "NTA. My first reaction\u2026OP isn\u2019t lying.   \n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty.  She could dish it out, but couldn\u2019t take it. Maybe she will think twice about telling you that you aren\u2019t ladylike. \n\nGood luck with the rest of college and be safe on the motorcycle.", "Hahaha this is brilliant!!! You sure shut her shut down. Brilliant comeback. Also make it clear you\u2019ll think about apologising once she apologises to you for all the nasty shit she says to you, your mother for the vile things she says about her and when your father apologised to you for letting some ring in constantly putting you down and lacking the spine to shut it down. \n\nNTA. She got her comeuppance.", "NTA. I believe the phrase here is don't start shit, won't be shit.\n\nYour father gave her free reign to be hateful and critical toward you. He could have called her out a long time ago on how she talked to his kids. He did not.\n\nYou are now an adult. You do not, in fact, have to sit there and take insults.", "NTA, super proud of you. You do not owe either of them an apology. You stood up for yourself, which you should not have had to do. Your father should have shut her shit down as soon as she started running her dirty mouth. Then, as if insulting you wasn't enough, she had to show how insecure she is by insulting your mom. She keeps saying bad things about your mom because she is A) hiding her guilt behind disdain, 2) knows she is lesser than your mother so she uses insults to make herself feel better 3) she knows she is immoral so she uses good manners and \"lady like\" etiquette to try to hide the fact she a homewrecker and no good. \n\nYour father doesn't say anything to her about these things because he is kitty whipped. If he tells her to stop it, she will probably throw guilt emotional blackmail at him. You do not owe any of them an apology. If your father tries to force it, I am so sorry you didn't learn any etiquette and are a homewrecker. Others gave much better ideas than me.", "I'd go NC with the whole lot.

As you will soon be my dads *current* wife I feel to avoid conflict we need to keep all communications strictly polite and not cross into **personal territory**\u201d.  \n\nWhich basically means don\u2019t say anything about my life (good, bad or indifferent).

Why not direct this anger at your dad? At the end of the day he is more responsible as he was the married partner at the time.\n\nYes, she was your late uncle's wife, but technically she was single, your dad wasn't. She may have known that your dad was married, but it was his responsibility to keep his marriage vows and has to take most of the blame for not doing so. I think most of  your anger is directed at the wrong person.", "ESH. Your mom seems okay though.\n\nYour Dad sucks for obvious cheating reasons.\n\nHis fianc\u00e9/affair partner sucks for being a misogynist and talking shit about your mom to your face - good lord she sounds positively insufferable. \n\nYou suck for focusing on her as an affair partner when she was single while your dad was cheating. It\u2019s not dishonoring a late partner to move on from them. By all means hate her, she\u2019s cruel and small minded, and those are totally valid reasons to not spend any time of energy on her. Focus on the actually detestable things she\u2019s doing today, it\u2019s a target rich environment.\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t be civil to her face, don\u2019t put yourself in a position where that\u2019s expected. Decline the invitation because she\u2019s unpleasant and critical of you and can\u2019t stop herself from saying unpleasant and critical things about your mom. You\u2019ve met her.
