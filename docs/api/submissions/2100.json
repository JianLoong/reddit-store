He is usually very respectful and well behaved, I didn't expect his behavior. Luckily, both him and his friend won't be returning.", "Yes, the owner is aware. The owner gave permission to have people over and said that he trusts my judgment. I am fine with the responsibility, I have house sat before and I had other people over at the houses too (with permission) but the other people respected the boundaries that I set. I always explain that it's not my or the visitor's house, so I always say \"don't touch anything and don't open anything. Rather ask when you want/need something\" (it basically bacme my house sitting motto).\nLuckily my mother replied and said that she understood. So I finally have some peace and quiet back.", "Thank you for the comment. And true, the homeowner and his wife once watched a movie (the movie wasn't even that loud) and one of the neighbors called security companies and the police because he was 'assaulting' his wife and causing a lot of noise. So I don't want to attract attention and I also don't want to cause them any trouble.", "He is usually very kind and helpful so I didn't expect the behavior.\nAnd the homeowner gave me permission to have people over ( I added it now. Sorry about the lack of clarity in the original post).", "Thank you for the comment. I see your point. I am the one that's looking after the house and the one that sets boundaries, however I cannot control other people's actions and therefore I requested that they do not return.", "Exactly. I told them that. I am allowed to use the speaker but if I were to use it (doubt it), I would keep the music down and respect the neighbors. And the house has extra safety measures, it was just to calm my mother's nerves. But she came over a few times and I think she's comfortable now. We also have a friend who is the boss of a security company in the area so they're doing extra patrols in the area and drive past the house too.", "Thank you for sharing your experience. I also sweep and mot the floors every second day because it's raining a lot and the dogs leave a few muddy paw prints lol. And that's nice. I bought and brought my own food and groceries, even though he gave permission to eat anything in the house. I will only eat their things that wouldn't last until they come back.", "Thank you for the comment. I messaged my mom because she's the one that wanted someone to stay over and she made the arrangements with the guy's mother.\nAnd they won't come back.", "Thank you for the comment, I agree with you, however I'll clarify on some of your statements : The homeowner did give permission to have people over, we also didn't run up the electricity bill. The only electricity that we use is for charging phones and the geyser (for washing dishes and taking quick showers). The rest of the house runs on solar panels and they have a gas stove (I dont use the oven). The house also doesn't have a TV.\nIt's my responsibility to keep the house clean.\nAnd they won't be returning.", "Thanks for the suggestion! This is a great idea and I'll definitely do this.", "Thank you. They won't come back here.", "He doesn't seem kind and not a friend, if the friend doesn't listens, calls me names and won't leave he is not a friend and I would never let him back into the house.", "Your friends are playing loud music in the gym. That is what I was referring to.", "Thank you for elaborating. They found a Bluetooth speaker (one of those medium portable hand-held ones) in the gym and brought it inside it house, while only playing music in the house. (The gym is part of the house but the door to the gym is at the outside of the house). The gym only has equipment that does not require electricity (weights, kettle bells, mats, bars, plates, workout steps, core wheels, boxing bag and equipment, crates, etc.. (I have permission to use the gym).", "Ok but right now you are just defending the people who you say you don\u2019t want there. Either they are causing problems or they aren\u2019t. Don\u2019t downplay it if what you said in your post is true, because you are now making yourself look an AH if it\u2019s not actually that big of a deal.", "I agree that he didn't do the right things and I don't want them here (they both left and won't return) because they did cause problems. I'm not downplaying anything and I'm not defending them, I just provided you with the correct information because you made your own statements. It wouldn't be fair to make a judgment based on your own statements and therfore I clarified on the situation :)", "NTA", "Honestly, since you personally know local policemen and security guys, I would have called one for help when the \"friends\" started to get a little too comfortable.", "I didn't even think about that. Thanks :)", "They are using up electric - whatever the source - by being there, eating, washing, washing their bed linen when they\u2019ve gone. No person exists without causing some kind of footprint, even before the playing of loud music. My statement was not incorrect. Three people are going to cost more than one. That\u2019s a fact.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m these situations if you have a bad feeling, trust your gut.", "NTA. Playing loud, vulgar music, moving things around and not cleaning up after oneself are all AH moves. One must make a distinction between staying in a hotel, where there are people being paid to clean up and put things back, and staying in another person's house. Good move not letting them come back. \n\nGood luck on your exams!", "NTA but what the heck has it got to do with your mom ??? I'm confused", " If they break anything you're the liable one. If the neighbors complain due to noise then you're the one that won't get a job the next time.", "True that. And thank you. Good luck to you too (in general. I'm not sure if you have exams too).", "My mom is the one who wanted someone to sleep over. She's also the one who made the arrangements. It was easier to tell her since she made the arrangements.", "so kick him out? he's clearly not actually your friend!", "Why would your mother care if you didn\u2019t let them come back?", "He did leave and he isn't returning.", "She's the one that wanted someone to stay over and she made the arrangements. We spoke about it and she said that she understands the situation and that she's fine with them not coming back.", "Okay. She just wanted you to be safe. Is there anyone else that you could have over who would respect you and the home and put your mom at ease?", "I cook food once a day, for dinner, all at once. It doesn't take extra electricity because I would have made extras for the next day or later. The rest of the time we ate leftovers, sandwiches, eggs, cereal etc (things that do not need electricity). They slept on the couches and didn't have any bedding or linen that needed a wash (it's quite warm here so no blankets or anything). As mentioned before, the ONLY electricity we used was for charging our phones and the geyser. The geyser doesn't take up extra electricity because it heats all the water in it at once. We all showered from the same 'geyser load' and the dishes were washed during the same time with the same load. So please stop making statements about the electricity usage and everything after I keep clarifying the situation.\nThe post was about the loud music, load of dishes, dirty house and stuff that were moved, NOT about electricity usage. Besides, I have permission to have people over so the owner won't mind the extra 2 phones that were charged.\nI won't elaborate on this situation any further. Have a lovely evening/day :)"]}
