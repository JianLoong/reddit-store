You absolutely do not need to fight with him. If he has joint custody, the court can arrange a neutral drop off point - I've had friends who were handed over at the police station because the parents were so hostile. The money can be automatically garnished from his wages and deposited to you without any ability for him to contact you. \n\nThat money is your children's right. Even if you don't use it, you can have it go into an account for their future use. However, in my state, you are not allowed to refuse except in very specific circumstances and feeling afraid and threatened of your ex is NOT a reason the courts will accept. That is unacceptable behavior that will jeopardize his custody. \n\nIf you have fears about your kids having a bad relationship with their dad, don't. Its inevitable if this is the way he behaves in order to provide for them.", "The courts can't force you to accept receiving child support.", "Child support is his obligation to the kids. It's court ordered and by being a jerk about vacation he FAFO. \n\nFind out what apps can be used in your jurisdiction and all communications can be documented there.\n\nHe can't bully you on the app because the county has it.\n\nI'll pray for you.", "True!", "Then why does he bill at helping pay for shoes why did mom have to buy the shoes?", "Refusing necessities is deadbeat. What kind of man won\u2019t buy shoes for his kid. He only has them 50/50 because he doesn\u2019t want to pay more support.", "It is such a hard equation to digest unless you really have all the facts. Love cannot be compelled to only words but how you feel. The actions you present and the effort you really put in are what matters in the end. Sometimes we forget that people love to manipulate with something that may relate in a fraction of a way and just jump on the band wagon with full negative support against the opposite party.", "It's actually not that simple. \n\nHe doesn't have to pay her anything more because child support is calculated to cover it all. \n\n- food\n- medical expenses \n- housing expenses \n- tuition fees \n- clothing \n- extracurricular activities \n\nBasically CS payment can cover all cost associated with raising the child. He would likely have to pay something even if he had majority custody.", "Then I would keep reminding him where his money is going to\u2014his child\u2014not his ex!

And he was in college. He left out his dad paid for college and he worked at his dad's company. Meanwhile I was working and studying as well and supporting our kid. \nThe judge waited for him to finish and asked: does any of those toys provided a meal? Shelter? Education? Actually, do you want your kid to have the same opportunity as you and go to college?\nThen he turned to me and said: I'm sorry I cannot enforce a higher payment. I hope your kid has anything he needs and it's not his fault he has a joke of a father. \nHe ended saying to my ex: do better. \nMy kid is a functional independent adult and yes, he had everything he needed growing up, including good values... From me and my family! \u263a\ufe0f", "Saw a dude request weekend visitation every two weeks and then get shocked when that equaled paying the majority of child support.

And he only had every wednesday dinner and every other weekend and begrudged every second. And then he bitched to us at burger king how expensive the child support was (while he and his new wife got new cars, a new house, and went on long vacations). Way to tell your kid you don't think they are worth your money.", "That was my ex. He told me I had to get his permission before I took our daughter to the doctor, bc it cost money. He had excellent insurance, he just didn\u2019t want to part with one cent more than he had to. My current husband (who also has excellent insurance) told him not to worry about it, we\u2019d put her on our insurance, and he\u2019d be more than happy to take care of her.

One that's with me 100% no support of any kind happens, my almost 17 year old that I've been paying support to his mother for 14 years has been full time with me for about a year.

It's the right of the children to have that money. You have to prove why it would be inappropriate to accept. Feeling threatened by the father is NOT appropriate.

He left the state to avoid paying and I raised mine entirely on my own. When my daughter was 15 I got a letter from the courts saying the order was unenforceable. That's right, for a minor child. His debt at that point was $150K. I've never seen a penny of it and I never will.\n\nThe courts don't give a damn about kids.", "Because he already pays more than her to support their child. He fully supports the child the when he has him half the time and then has to pay $100 on top of that. Let her pay for the damn shoes", "But does he ever independently buy anything for his child (clothing, toys, medical expenses, school field trips, etc)? Or did he make his ex wife supply all new clothing etc., because he \"pays support\"?", "They should be equally responsible if they have 50/50. Your brother raising the child half of the time, so there should not be any child support. His ex should be capable to earn enough money to have the children half of the time...

Why should he provide 50% of the care, necessities at his home, bills at his home, transportation from his home, and hers as well? He shouldn\u2019t. If the mother can\u2019t afford shoes it seem that the custody agreement should be changed to reflect that.", "Well I think that is ridiculous.", "I honestly hope I get a judge like yours.

So if the court believes it takes $1,000, his share is $600 and the ex-wife's share is $400, he'd pay $100 to her to make up the difference.
