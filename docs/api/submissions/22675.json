I'm not saying get the best, I'm saying always pay \"extra\" (aka not even close to the cheapest)\n\nIf the \"cheap waterproof boots\" end up not working well or at all, it's all wasted money.", ">Not where a 3yo is concerned\n\nEhhhh, I wouldn't necessarily say that. The cheap ones can fall apart if you live in an area that gets a lot of moisture. On top of that, if you live somewhere that sells things very seasonally, they can be tough to replace. I've been through this with my kids. We live in a rural area, and they stop selling winter boots literally a month after winter has started (dumb). So if their boots end up crapping out on me, I usually have to order them online (which I hate doing because you can never really gauge size), or drive a couple hours away. And even then, that's a gamble because the roads might not be open."]}
