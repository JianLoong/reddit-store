They had nowhere to go so my immediate family & I (I was in highschool) all agreed to put our paychecks together & have half my mom's family (2 married sisters, 6 nieces, mom, and their pets) stay with us in our house while the others stayed in a pet friendly hotel paid for by us. \n\nWhen they arrived in Virginia, the week was filled with complaints that we were rubbing our wealth in their face because we were the only family to own a home and they didn't (grandmother is very wealthy, but won't share with her struggling children/grandchildren, nor will she use the money to improve her own life, she also rents). We apologized & said we would do better next time. \n\nNext year, I'm graduating high school and my immediate family and I agree to pool our funds and invite my mom's side of the family over for my graduation. This time we would stage them in a nice 4 star hotel, everyone who wanted their own rooms got one, everyone else shared. They then proceeded to complain that we didn't think they were worth a 5 star hotel, and secretly moved to a 5 star after we already paid for lodging. They then complained they lost money because we're too selfish to give them a nice stay. \n\nNext year my cousin graduated, we attempted to make plans to figure out the lodging but were ignored. We were simply given a time/ date for the graduation. My immediate family & I get a hotel in Florida. My mom's family still ignores us when we reach out. My grandfather calls, and informs us the whole family is staying with him (also very wealthy) and that he would have invited us to stay with him, but the family voted no. We remained professional and enjoyed our time. \n\nThe next year my brother graduates, we invite the family, but inform them they will pay for their own lodging & if they choose not to come due to money problems then we understand. The entire family manages to show for my brothers graduation, but they now complain the entire stay that we are AH for not allowing them into our home, nor paying for their lodging, and that we are everything wrong with the \"modern day family.\" \n\nI proceeded to call them out for their bullshit and that they were ungrateful, immature, pricks, and a lot of other personal things I won't get into. \n\nWe've had zero contact since, but there was an announcement of a massive family get-together in March. We were not invited, and we only knew due to my grandfather reaching out and updating us and saying he would not attend if we couldn't. Apparently the family is split 60/40 on who's going / not going to stand with us. Ultimately it was agreed that I was the deciding factor on why my family is excluded and why the event is in shambles. \n\nThey agreed we're welcome if I apologize in front of everyone and admit I was wrong, along with also paying for the more expensive items being hosted at the event. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704664934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1913y9y/aitah_for_not_apologizing_to_my_extended_family/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After years of bitchiness you finally said a few truths.   They are  only angry because it was true and can't backdown or they will lose face.

They want to go to the gathering, but won't if we can't attend.

To hold a child responsible for \u201cupgrades\u201d is absurd and wildly inappropriate.", "A good idea, but it's a tad complicated. My cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandmother don't want us to attend, but some of my cousins, husbands, parents are on our side.

I personally was not being looked to for upgrades in lodging, that was aimed at my parents. My brother and I simply aided in funding and planning for guests. My family and I apologized regardless the first time around and attempted to do better the second, but at no point were they expecting me to cough up the buckaroos.\n\nWhat I'm being held responsible for is what I said to them years later in retaliation for their actions.\n\nI hope that clears it up a bit", "NTA. My favorite part is they want an apology \u201cand pay for the more expensive items being hosted.\u201d They don\u2019t even try to disguise their disgusting greed. Instead they keep escalating it. \n\nDo not apologize. You have nothing to apologize for. They were incredibly rude and greedy for years & finally you told them what needed to be said. \n\nI love your grandpa!", "OMG your family sounds like a nightmare!  Unsure if you should apologize since you neglected to tell exactly what you said.  Still if your account is strictly factual, I have a feeling they deserved it!", "NTA.  What is wrong with these people?", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. Your extended family are very entitled and ungrateful..", "NTA- Go on vacation during that time. Take Grandpa send photos.", "NTA. tell everyone to do what they want, you don't want to go. What anyone else decides is on them. You will not make any decision for them.", "I think the time to address issues is as soon as possible. In your narrative, extended family was upset, many times & complained.(but not to your faces?) Someone needed to say, let\u2019s sit down & talk. There is an old saying\u2026. When TWO parties do not get along, look to the 3rd person or persons involved. Sounds like there is a snake in the family. I have no clue who it might be. Family situations often get completely misunderstood. And some families gobble up all the crazy \u201che said, she said\u201d. For your family, this seems to be happening over & over. It will be so easy to put your emotions aside, and say, let\u2019s talk. If you all talk, & you hurt them, you will probably easily apologize. Dont get caught up in the emotion of it all. So Then you can talk it out with love. \nIf you do not love these people then stay away. \nGrandpa sounds wonderful! He probably loves everyone. Who do you want to emulate? The people who love everyone\u2026\u2026 Or the people who do not?", "NTA.  Enjoy the savings of going no contact.  Or just go to the bank and set up life long payments to these people because that's what they want.  They're jealous of the fact that your side of the family did better working hard for their money and had better luck than them.  And now they want an apology because you've got money and that's bad in their minds.\n\nI haven't talked to my aunt in about a decade.  I was polite to her during an anniversary dinner for my mother she planned around a decade ago, but before that I hadn't talked to her in about a decade too.  She threw a screaming fit at me one day about 20 years ago, scared the life out of me, refused to let me leave the room while she screamed at me and caused massive problems between me and my mom (because my mom made me stay and listen to her) that nearly ended up in me in foster care or running away.  My mom and I have only just been able to recover our relationship in the last few years and there's still strain.  My aunt has never apologized and I doubt she ever will given that she's now fallen out with my mother because she (my aunt) cancelled my mother's family gathering behind mom's back when she wasn't even involved in the planning and now blames my mom for their fight.  Unfortunately, her side of the family is now nearly no contact with ours as a result of them taking her side.  I'm opting to support mom, but I've stated that I have no interest in ever having a relationship with my aunt or most of her side of the family.  Sometimes narcissists just need to be moved to a no contact list and you just need to stick to the family who actually respect those around them.", "NTA. I\u2019m lost. Why would you even *want* to be around these tiresome, whiners? Like, what about a reunion with them is appealing to you or your family?", "WTF did I just read? Is this meant for Entitled People sub or what?\n\nNTA", "We love our grandpa too, I appreciate your input!", "I attempted to remain as unbiased as possible. \n\nSome things I will share to specify a little on what I said:\n\n1). They told my mother she was shit, and attacked my family on how we operate as a unit. My response was to tell them that every single one of my aunts and uncles is several times divorced along with my grandmother. All cousins are half siblings, so they can't say shit about my parents (28 years married, no divorce) and we operate fine considering we hosted them multiple times and navigated our own family issues without ever needing outside help from them.\n\n2). They complained we flaunt our wealth and then attack us when we can't afford to have them stay at a 5 star resort. Why don't my aunts go to their greedy ass mother (grandma) since she actually is quite wealthy. My aunts are trying to feed, care, and raise their children at minimum wage jobs and expect my family to pay for everything when Grandma could easily buy her daughters medium sized homes and pay the bills with no sweat on her end, or be more involved by helping pay for school supplies or literally anything.\n\nThere's other personal matters that I got into, but the important stuff I said is up top. Though what I said may be seen as mean Spirited, I said what I thought was right at the time .", "\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f no idea.", "I hear you, I appreciate your input, thank you!\n\nTo further explain, They've complained to our faces everytime. They were always very direct with us on their problems towards my family and I, but it was always money related whether it be us \"flaunting\" it or not spending enough on them the way they'd prefer.", "\"Family, this situation doesn't make sense to me. The only thing I'm sure about is I don't owe an apology. Do with that what you will, but stop bugging me.\"", "IMO There is more to this story that you are not telling. Families don\u2019t dump other families unless constant drama goes on & they are just tired of it. OR maybe you have been insensitive to them & the last argument was the final straw. Might need to do a bit of self reflection. Or maybe they REALLY are unpleasant. Then choose to stay away", "NTA.  I don't understand what you'd be apologizing for.  You took them in and paid for their stay several times.  They were being immature and ungrateful.  Don't apologize to these assholes, move on with you life like they don't exist.  They don't want you there, don't go.  Why would you want to be around people that don't want you there?  The other members of your family are adults and therefore are able to make their own decisions.", "Add: And I'm a human being that works for my money not your personal ATM.", "Interesting take. What's missing, maybe I can attempt to fill some of the blanks?", "Seriously, why are you even contemplating apologizing for not accepting being their personal bank account?  Your family worked hard for the money it has.  Stop apologizing for that.", "I don't think grandad should get a pass at excluding you from his house just because other people voted against it.\n\nHe should have stood his ground, invited you, and told the others that if they didn't agree then they could leave.", "Fair point, but I think my family and I were fine with the decision made. We were just happy that someone was mature enough to communicate anything at all, and he still spent the majority of the time with us rather than with those who voted us out. \n\nHis house, his rules, but the hotel was probably a better climate than sharing a roof with the haters club"]}
