{"id": 34560, "submission_id": "1913y9y", "title": "AITAH for not apologizing to my extended \"family\" and ruining this years family gathering?", "selftext": "Back in 2013 - 2014 my mom's side of the family had to evacuate FL due to an incoming hurricane. They had nowhere to go so my immediate family & I (I was in highschool) all agreed to put our paychecks together & have half my mom's family (2 married sisters, 6 nieces, mom, and their pets) stay with us in our house while the others stayed in a pet friendly hotel paid for by us. \n\nWhen they arrived in Virginia, the week was filled with complaints that we were rubbing our wealth in their face because we were the only family to own a home and they didn't (grandmother is very wealthy, but won't share with her struggling children/grandchildren, nor will she use the money to improve her own life, she also rents). We apologized & said we would do better next time. \n\nNext year, I'm graduating high school and my immediate family and I agree to pool our funds and invite my mom's side of the family over for my graduation. This time we would stage them in a nice 4 star hotel, everyone who wanted their own rooms got one, everyone else shared. They then proceeded to complain that we didn't think they were worth a 5 star hotel, and secretly moved to a 5 star after we already paid for lodging. They then complained they lost money because we're too selfish to give them a nice stay. \n\nNext year my cousin graduated, we attempted to make plans to figure out the lodging but were ignored. We were simply given a time/ date for the graduation. My immediate family & I get a hotel in Florida. My mom's family still ignores us when we reach out. My grandfather calls, and informs us the whole family is staying with him (also very wealthy) and that he would have invited us to stay with him, but the family voted no. We remained professional and enjoyed our time. \n\nThe next year my brother graduates, we invite the family, but inform them they will pay for their own lodging & if they choose not to come due to money problems then we understand. The entire family manages to show for my brothers graduation, but they now complain the entire stay that we are AH for not allowing them into our home, nor paying for their lodging, and that we are everything wrong with the \"modern day family.\" \n\nI proceeded to call them out for their bullshit and that they were ungrateful, immature, pricks, and a lot of other personal things I won't get into. \n\nWe've had zero contact since, but there was an announcement of a massive family get-together in March. We were not invited, and we only knew due to my grandfather reaching out and updating us and saying he would not attend if we couldn't. Apparently the family is split 60/40 on who's going / not going to stand with us. Ultimately it was agreed that I was the deciding factor on why my family is excluded and why the event is in shambles. \n\nThey agreed we're welcome if I apologize in front of everyone and admit I was wrong, along with also paying for the more expensive items being hosted at the event. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704664934, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1913y9y/aitah_for_not_apologizing_to_my_extended_family/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they dont get over it, screw them. Money is the root of a LOT of family issues and turmoil.\n\nTry again to mend but dont count on it.

After years of bitchiness you finally said a few truths.   They are  only angry because it was true and can't backdown or they will lose face.

My grandfather wanted to reach out and let us know so we weren't shocked if we found out through other means.\n\nThe issue is more about those siding with us. They want to go to the gathering, but won't if we can't attend. So there's this split in the family but one side wants me to apologize for their ego or whatever, and the other side wants me to apologize so they can still attend (even though they can still go anyways) \n\nSorry if that doesn't make sense, I'm still confused too about a lot of things", "This.

No hard feelings to him, while the others were at the house, he spent most of his time with us at the hotel.\n\n5).

To hold a child responsible for \u201cupgrades\u201d is absurd and wildly inappropriate.", "A good idea, but it's a tad complicated. My cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandmother don't want us to attend, but some of my cousins, husbands, parents are on our side. So it would be strange to have someones parents at a gather and we've never met their son, nor knew my cousins got married in the first place.\n\nAt most it'd be my grandfather and my mom's aunt that we actually know", "Absolutely, and thanks, we like him too", "Sorry, I think there might be a misunderstanding still. I personally was not being looked to for upgrades in lodging, that was aimed at my parents. My brother and I simply aided in funding and planning for guests. My family and I apologized regardless the first time around and attempted to do better the second, but at no point were they expecting me to cough up the buckaroos.\n\nWhat I'm being held responsible for is what I said to them years later in retaliation for their actions.\n\nI hope that clears it up a bit"]}
