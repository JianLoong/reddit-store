My grandfather died when I was 10 but I was still very close with him and miss him dearly. \n\nMy daughter is getting married and has spoken to me about how she wants kids and her own family, she then mentioned she wanted my necklace. I was very taken aback and asked why. She said she wanted to \u201ccarry on the legacy\u201d of my grandfather and \u201cit would make sense\u201d for her to have it after me.

No my necklace IS NOT a family heirloom.\nIt was given as a present since I was the first child of my parents.

And maybe she wants it so it can be a symbol of that for her future children. \n\nI am just saying that if it is the idea of an heirloom that she is interested in, maybe you can help her with an alternative to that.

Both of my parents shared stories about their grandparents and my sister and i both feel connected to them through those stories.  Our grandparents also died either when we were young or before we were born.  The items we have of theirs are really treasured possessions and represent our family history.\n\nMy mother was excited to pass down her grandmother's jewelry to us.  We *gasp* even had multiple family pieces remade into new \"sister rings\" to represent our families.\n\nSharing family history is important", "If you're talking about the idea of having this thing buried to you rather than leaving it to her, YTA.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich is what it's sounds like because you describe her request for it as being that she gets it after you. \n\nWhen the music's over, turn out the lights.

She wants it because she wants it, and the family history argument is the convenient argument of the moment.\n\nIt is selfish and entitled to demand a mother give up her most special and precious piece of jewelry. She knows why and how her mother cherishes it, but she still thinks she is entitled to it *now*? \n\nHonestly, if my child demanded her inheritance while I\u2019m living and still enjoying my own property, I would probably leave said piece of property to another person.

This probably has very little to do with the necklace.\n\nMy point is that mom is an asshole for saying her daughter can't possibly find the connection to her great-grandfather as meaningful just because she didn't meet him", "You\u2019re selfish if you\u2019re buried with it. I\u2019m not saying give it away now, I\u2019m saying you should leave it to your daughter when you\u2019re dead.", "To be honest\u2026she probably can\u2019t have a connection as meaningful as OP had with Great-Grandfather. She can cherish the stories she\u2019s been told and have an affinity or love for him, but she cannot have a relationship with or memories of a man that died before she was even born. The way OP said it may have been unkind, but it is bizarre to me that people think her daughter could ever have the same connection OP did with a family member she never met. And even if it was possible, it is selfish beyond my comprehension to demand mom\u2019s necklace. \n\nYou are no doubt right that there is a lot we don\u2019t know about their mom-daughter relationship, but there is no dynamic I can imagine that justifies daughter making such a demand.", "If I want to be buried with my necklace I feel as I would be entitled to do so. I don\u2019t have to give away everything of mine when I die which I am sure I\u2019m not close to.", "I'm not saying it's the same as knowing the person, but it's absolutely not fair for OP to act like the daughter can't find comfort and connection with her great-grandfather.   Speaking as someone who definitely feels a connection to relatives who have passed it's bizarre to say it's not a thing.  My dad passed away in '21 and my child will obviously never get to meet him, but I do hope that they can feel connected to him.  I'm not sure what good parent wouldn't want their kid to feel that way about someone who was important to them.\n\nI'm not saying the daughter's demand is justified, but something about OP's energy is off.  There's definitely a history there that at least explains daughter's behavior", "Plan on an open casket funeral and being sealed in and buried in front of witnesses, or there is no guarantee you will actually be buried with it or that it remains in the family.", "Yeah that makes you an AH in my opinion. You\u2019re not going to know you\u2019re buried with it because, plot twist, you\u2019re dead. Obviously your daughter has built an emotional connection with the necklace because of how much you love it and loved your grandfather. Idk why you refuse to acknowledge that or why you don\u2019t want encourage her love for your grandfather.", "I don\u2019t feel she has a connection with my necklace. Other than when I told her the backstory of it years and years ago when she was young she\u2019s never talked, asked or even acknowledged my necklace up until now.", "that doesn't mean she never thought about it. you obviously loved your grandfather & i'm guessing she's heard you talk about him. especially since it's something she's seen you wear every single day of her life. you don't necessarily have to have met/known someone to feel a connection to them. it's her mother's grandfather.\n\ni totally get why you want to be able to keep wearing it for the rest of your life and obviously it's yours and you can do whatever you want with it. but to insist that she won't even get it once you die is pretty weird IMO. first of all, you'll be DEAD. second of all, i'm sure it would be something that would help her feel connected to you once you're gone.\n\nbut hey, like i said, if you don't want your daughter to have this piece of her family lineage to treasure, then go ahead and insist in your will that you be buried with it. i'm sure you'll look great and she won't look at you in your casket, see the necklace & be reminded that you didn't think she was worthy of it.", "She clearly thinks she has a connection, you get to decide she doesn\u2019t. Do you even like your daughter?", "I have specified it is not anything to do with family lineage. It was a present that was given to me that I intend to keep. She has jewellery given to her when she was born (from me and her father) and from her grandparents as well", "You assume because I don\u2019t want to give away the last thing I have left of my grandfather I don\u2019t like my daughter? This is a childish assumption", "No, I assume that because you invalidated her connection to your grandfather instead of trying to understand why she feels a connection and so passionately about keeping his memory alive. \n\nIf anyone sounds childish, it\u2019s you. You seem to be like a toddler saying \u201cno, MY grandfather. Mine, mine, mine\u201d instead of acknowledging your daughter could see her entire life how much you loved and looked up to him and she wants a connection to someone you loved that much. I actually think it\u2019s beautiful your daughter seems to care so much about your grandfather."]}
