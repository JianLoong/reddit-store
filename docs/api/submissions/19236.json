I informed her of just about everything I could - transitional housing, etc.\r  \n\r  \nThen, I ended up telling my parents something that I think got through to them, which was in a sense that \"I am trying to live my life, get my education and start my career, and that can't happen if I'm responsible for her.\"\r  \n\r  \nTruthfully taking her on with or without my roommates approval would have been so much more than the risk of eviction \\[Which yes, it's in our lease. Sorry I didn't get back to some of you on that\\]. It would have been the financial stress of taking on a.. kid \\[legal adult, but she \\*is\\* still a kid\\] who doesn't know how to handle bills and general budgeting, would have no transportation \\[we don't live near busses and ubers are a good 40 bucks here\\], no money, etc.\r  \n\r  \nI love her, I care for her, but the point was made to my parents when I emhasized that I'm worrying about \\*me\\* right now. I've lived with people who don't pull their weight, and as much as I sympathize with her inability to, I'm not in a position where I can take that responsibility on again.\r  \n\r  \nI'm not sure what about it got through to them, but it did, and they backed off. They agreed. They're offering to get her an apartment and help her find a roommate, while covering her rent while she adjusts. \\[They had their own valid reasons for not wanting her in their house\\], and if things go well with her, they'd cover her transportation to school/work until they would get her a car. The plan is to essentially slowly work her up to paying for everything, and it's ultimately a good situation for her.\r  \n\r  \nShe has two plans lined up right now, both feasible, each with help from willing parties, and they have left the ball in her court.", "created_utc": 1686170000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143o4lz/update_aita_told_my_parents_i_cant_take_my_sister/", "score": 31, "replies": ["#[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bco4m/aita_told_my_parents_i_cant_take_my_sister_from/)", "That\u2019s awesome! So happy it worked out for you and her \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70", "Info: 1) you heavily implied in the last post that your parents could take her in. Now they're going so far as to pay for her own apartment rather than let her live with them. You said the reason was valid, but can you tell us what it is? It's a pretty huge factor in who the AH is. At this point it's certainly NAH, but I'm curious. \n\n2) Was I reading that right? Your sister had to pay her foster parent!? That can't be right.\n\nIf it hasn't already been suggested, tell your sister to make an appointment with your state's vocation rehabilitation department. In my state, Maryland, it's call DORS, the Dept. of Rehabilitation Services. Each state has a different name, but it always has the word rehabilitation and/or vocation in it. The point is that their whole deal is helping you get a job, including education. In my state, if you have any level of disability whether its \"just\" depression, a learning disability, or something severe like schizophrenia, and a doctor is willing to verify that you have that problem, they will pay for college. Yes, they will pay for college. The less severe your problem is, the longer you have to wait, but still, free college. Or vocational training if you want. Even if your sister doesn't qualify for tuition coverage, they have fantastic resources for helping people find a job. Good luck!", "Yeah no in the original post OP kept saying (or at least implying) that they could take her in easily but were pushing OP to do it instead, painting a pretty selfish picture. Now they have a valid reason? Why was that not mentioned in the original post?", "> Was I reading that right? Your sister had to pay her foster parent!? That can't be right.\n\nI think it was that sis had to pay the foster parent if she wanted to stay there after she turned 18 and was no longer legally a ward of the state."]}
