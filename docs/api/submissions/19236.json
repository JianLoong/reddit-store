{"id": 19236, "submission_id": "143o4lz", "title": "UPDATE: AITA: Told my parents I can't take my sister from foster care for 2 months", "selftext": "Hi guys, this is a pretty simple update - but for starters things have somewhat resolved themselves without much from me, which is one huge relief.\r  \n\r  \nEssentially I urged my little sister to continue to look into other things, contact her social worker, utilize the resources that some of yall, my roommate, and I found. I informed her of just about everything I could - transitional housing, etc.\r  \n\r  \nThen, I ended up telling my parents something that I think got through to them, which was in a sense that \"I am trying to live my life, get my education and start my career, and that can't happen if I'm responsible for her.\"\r  \n\r  \nTruthfully taking her on with or without my roommates approval would have been so much more than the risk of eviction \\[Which yes, it's in our lease. Sorry I didn't get back to some of you on that\\]. It would have been the financial stress of taking on a.. kid \\[legal adult, but she \\*is\\* still a kid\\] who doesn't know how to handle bills and general budgeting, would have no transportation \\[we don't live near busses and ubers are a good 40 bucks here\\], no money, etc.\r  \n\r  \nI love her, I care for her, but the point was made to my parents when I emhasized that I'm worrying about \\*me\\* right now. I've lived with people who don't pull their weight, and as much as I sympathize with her inability to, I'm not in a position where I can take that responsibility on again.\r  \n\r  \nI'm not sure what about it got through to them, but it did, and they backed off. They agreed. They're offering to get her an apartment and help her find a roommate, while covering her rent while she adjusts. \\[They had their own valid reasons for not wanting her in their house\\], and if things go well with her, they'd cover her transportation to school/work until they would get her a car. The plan is to essentially slowly work her up to paying for everything, and it's ultimately a good situation for her.\r  \n\r  \nShe has two plans lined up right now, both feasible, each with help from willing parties, and they have left the ball in her court.", "created_utc": 1686170000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143o4lz/update_aita_told_my_parents_i_cant_take_my_sister/", "score": 223, "replies": ["#[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bco4m/aita_told_my_parents_i_cant_take_my_sister_from/)", "That\u2019s awesome! So happy it worked out for you and her \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70", "Info: 1) you heavily implied in the last post that your parents could take her in. Now they're going so far as to pay for her own apartment rather than let her live with them. You said the reason was valid, but can you tell us what it is? It's a pretty huge factor in who the AH is. At this point it's certainly NAH, but I'm curious. \n\n2) Was I reading that right? Your sister had to pay her foster parent!? That can't be right.\n\nIf it hasn't already been suggested, tell your sister to make an appointment with your state's vocation rehabilitation department. In my state, Maryland, it's call DORS, the Dept. of Rehabilitation Services. Each state has a different name, but it always has the word rehabilitation and/or vocation in it. The point is that their whole deal is helping you get a job, including education. In my state, if you have any level of disability whether its \"just\" depression, a learning disability, or something severe like schizophrenia, and a doctor is willing to verify that you have that problem, they will pay for college. Yes, they will pay for college. The less severe your problem is, the longer you have to wait, but still, free college. Or vocational training if you want. Even if your sister doesn't qualify for tuition coverage, they have fantastic resources for helping people find a job. Good luck!", "Yeah no in the original post OP kept saying (or at least implying) that they could take her in easily but were pushing OP to do it instead, painting a pretty selfish picture. Now they have a valid reason? Why was that not mentioned in the original post?", "> Was I reading that right? Your sister had to pay her foster parent!? That can't be right.\n\nI think it was that sis had to pay the foster parent if she wanted to stay there after she turned 18 and was no longer legally a ward of the state.", "she said in the original post sister has been paying them, she\u2019s not 18 yet i don\u2019t think", "In the first paragraph of the original post it is established that 1. The sister is 18 2. The foster parents and the sister came up with an arrangement so she could continue living with them now that she\u2019s an adult (paying them) and 3. That they changed their minds", "can you and your sister get an apartment together?", "She probably didnt know at the time.\n\nAnd, as most people, she altered her position after learning new information", "The parents are OP's adopted parents. From the original post, OP and sister were separated quite young and OP was the only one raised by the adopted parents from an early age. \n\nThe sister lived with the (likely abusive) bio-parents in another state for a further 8 years, until bio-parents died and sister and other siblings entered foster care. \n\nIt's possible that the parents wanted to help the sister, but not enough to open their own home indefinitely to a teenage foster kid they don't know?", "i don\u2019t think we need to give a judgement for an update", "Many states have special arrangements for foster kids if they attend college in-state, from free tuition to special scholarship funds, especially if she plans to start at a community college. I would start with the social worker for that. The sister could also ask at a local college/university to see what would be available--it won't cost anything to visit or have a Zoom conversation with the financial aid department.", "You may have noticed that my judgement wasn't exactly the focus of the comment. In fact, I only brought it up because it pertains to the 1st question I was making: What changed OP's mind about how he viewed his parents in all this? Before their reasoning made them AHs, now there reasoning was valid. What changed?\n\nGlad I could straighten that out for you.", "I considered the part about her getting free tuition as a foster, but she's moving to another state to be with them. Still, I wholeheartedly encourage the rest of what you recommend.\n\nIn general, people have no clue what benefits are out there just waiting for them to apply for. This country would be a very, very different place if everyone actually knew about just the state benefits and programs. That's not even including the Federal and private.", ">I 22F have a younger sister, 18F, who's aging out of foster care. I had the luck of being adopted, whereas she did not. She had an arrangement to stay with her foster parent, though to my knowledge the foster parent suddenly changed her mind despite charging her money to stay there right now.\n\nSo yeah, she wasn't being charged to live with the foster parent *before* aging out. Since OP worded it as, \"I have a younger sister, 18F, who's aging out of foster care,\" I got confused. She actually meant to say that her sister \"just aged out\" or \"has aged out\". The way she worded it implied that her sister hadn't aged out yet. That was my source of confusion.\n\nWhew. I actually had to click all those links and re-read a bunch of sentences (which I could have just done in the first place) and type up this comment... I'm exhausted.", "Haha well done. I really doubt she was paying before she turned 18, though. That\u2019s not how fostering works, as I understand it. I doubt she literally just turned 18 - the implication, at least how I read it, is \u201cshe had an arrangement to stay with her foster parent [after she turned 18 X amount of months ago], though to my knowledge the foster parent suddenlychanged her mind despite charging her money to stay right now\u201d. That\u2019s the easiest and most logical interpretation to me, though I\u2019m with you that her phrasing of \u201cis aging out\u201d is a bit confusing. I just assumed she meant now that she\u2019s officially being kicked out after the foster parent reneged on the arrangement.\n\nEDIT: sorry, it\u2019s late and I completely misread the first sentence of your comment! We\u2019re on the same page :)"]}
