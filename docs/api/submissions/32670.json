My first child is John (13 M) through my former wife.\n\nWe recently moved to a new house as we were previous living in the same house where my first wife Sarah and I used to live at. I wanted to get away from it as it was hard for me to remain there. However, I carried everything else with me, including my first wedding photograph, and other pictures of her.\n\nEmily was against the idea as she said that the whole point of moving elsewhere to start afresh, and that I should not be carrying pictures of my former wife as it shows that  I am still latching onto her or something. I refused by pointing out that I do not want to do that. She argued, but in the end she gave in, or so I thought.\n\nYesterday, Emily approached me and said that she doesn't think I'd have any issues related to Sarah any longer.\n\nI asked her what she meant, and she said  that while I was at work, she and Hannah took the opportunity to throw away the wedding photograph and other stuff I had of Sarah. She wanted to \"come clean\" about it or something.\n\nI was flabbergasted, and we got into a really large argument, and I called her a \"goddamn country w\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\", among other words. In the end, she was saying that I should not be having such photographs of other women in the first place, and that she only wanted the best for her daughter and herself. She's not talking to me now (is giving me the silent treatment), and Hannah's very upset as well.

Because this is crazy land.", "NTA\n\n>that she only wanted the best for her daughter and herself.\n\nI don't understand how getting rid of photos of your late wife is what's best for her and her daughter. Actually... I think I can figure out her very flawed logic. Emily did this to stake her claim on you. She's sees you as her possession and tossed the photos in an attempt to win against a woman who isn't even around anymore.", "NTA MASSIVE RED FLAG!  This is one of the most telling, obvious, and consistent red flags you can find in new marriages/relationships, especially blended families. She will try to push herself onto your son as a mother and alienate him from you both, or simply intentionally alienate him from both of you since he is the \"other woman's\" child. She WILL play favorites with the kids, I can bet you that. For your own son's sake, you MUST end this nonsense now.\n\nShe does not care about what you or your son think. She does not care about how you and your son feel. Those were photos of the mother of your child, not an Ex you broke up with. I would suggest immediately leaving her. It may seem drastic, but no one who behaves like this should be trusted in any capacity.\n\nIf you love your son at all, get your photos out of the trash and walk away.", "Info: how long were you a widow before you remarried?\n\nI'm just curious. Tbh marrying somebody that has no respect for your first wife, your son's mom, makes no sense to me. Seems divorce worthy to me.", "Assuming this is real, your wife is the AH. You are NTA.\n\nYou have a son. Your son, I'm sure, would have loved that album in the future. It was not hers to destroy or get rid of.\n\nQuite honestly, this is where you call the police for theft, file a report for the theft and divorce. What she did... that is incredibly destructive to your CHILD. \n\nHer wanting the best for her and her daughter has nothing to do with a box of photos. They do not impact her. THey do impact YOUR child and his link to his mother.", "NTA\n\nThis would be a deal breaker for me. There's nothing wrong with saving photos of your late wife, for your son if nothing else. It speaks volumes that she only wants the best for herself and her daughter, leaving your feelings and that of your son out of her equation.\n\nI'm so sorry. I can't imagine how she thought she had the right to do this.", "NTA. Your sons mother is DEAD. These items are memories your son could have kept to have something of both his parents together. Your now wife is incredibly selfish and jealous of a dead woman. How long has your wife been gone? You and your son are still grieving as it can take years to come to terms with things like this. Your wife is telling you point blank that she thinks only of herself and the daughter. Your poor son now has to suffer because of this. She clearly is not acting with care towards your son and how something like this could impact him.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nEmily is the asshole here. Absolutely anything you do to her in response to her maliciously destroying your photos of your late wife is acceptable and understandable.\n\nFor your sake, I recommend divorce.

This is not alright and will cause permanent damage to him. You need to think about him first in this situation. She did this not only to you but to him. She took every last momnto of his deceased mother and destroyed it. As someone who lost a parent young, this can feel like losing the parent all over again. Stop what ever you are currently do and go take care of him, make him your priority and do what ever he needs, and one of those things is keep your new wife away from him, because in some ways she just rekilled his mother.", "OP if she does this to the photos imagine how she treats your son when you are not there, and she even invilved her daughter in this crazy jealusy.\n\nNTA, talk to your son", "NTA.

Honestly, you could have called her every swear word in the book and you still wouldn\u2019t be an asshole. \n\nShe destroyed your property and photos that held memories dear to you and your son. Photos that included a woman who is no longer on this earth. You can\u2019t recreate pictures or rebuy those gifts. \n\nI hope you had some of them elsewhere or had negatives/digital copies to print. \n\nI would very much be divorcing someone who did this, especially since she didn\u2019t do it alone.

How soon before she decided to get rid of your son because it is best for her daughter?", "Sounds fake but I\u2019ll entertain it.\n\nNTA - how in the world did you get together in the first place without discussing these things or red flag? This seems like a deal breaker situation, especially if you have a son who would\u2019ve loved memories of his mom.", "My heart is broken for your son. She just threw away photos of *his mother*. \nYou have a responsibility to protect your son, and anyone callous and jealous enough to do something like this does not have your son's best interest at heart. Nor yours. I don't usually call for divorce but I don't see your relationship getting past this. To me, this is in \"unforgivable\" territory.

Your life with your late wife is still part of your life history", "She may have been your first wife, but she is your son's MOTHER! And he deserves the love, respect, and honor of her in his home. It's not like you divorce. She f-ing DIED! This isn't the first time I have heard of this happening and honestly your comments were tame compared to what I would've said. I am not sure your new marriage can survive this. Get into couples counseling now if you want any chance of moving forward. She needs help to uncover why she is so threatened by a dead woman. NTA.", "NTA- I do not blame you for one second for using that language to her. She threw away something special to you, something that would've been special to your son. These weren't pictures of some woman who divorced you. These were pictures of a woman, who'd you still be married to, if fate hadn't intervened. I'm so sorry to you and your son for everything that happened. I hope things get better for you two.", "If it was a case of A) you\u2019d just broke up and she was still alive or B) there wasn\u2019t your son and you just wanted to keep her memory around then maybe it would be alright to want her out of your life, destroying the photos would never be ok under case B tho. \n\nBut the fact you have your son who may want to know about is mother or may want to see pictures that makes this act incredibly selfish and horrible and if it was me I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay with her after it, absolutely not the asshole", "This would be the end of the relationship for me.

She is a controlling, hurtful bitch for that.\n\n>she only wanted the best for her daughter and herself\n\nNotice she doesn't want the best for you and your son? And she never will. \n\nShe is so insecure that she threw out pictures of a woman who is no longer her, and cannot possibly be a threat to your marriage.  She threw out your memories as though they were unimportant.  And she threw out your son's only pictures of his mom. Those wedding pictures likely showed her at her happiest, too!\n\nShe had her daughter help, too? Like she is teaching her daughter it is okay to disregard you (and others) in order to meet her own wants and needs? How she did not even think about your son wanting those pictures is unbelievable. They could have been just in a box in the attic until he was grown up and moved out.\n\nThink about whether you want this woman policing the rest of your life. Watch how she treats your son. And know he is hurt too, by her actions. This also cost him something he can't get back. Please look out for him through this too. \n\nYour wife is not combining families. She has taken you on as a resource. You are living her life now, and I am sad for you!", "I say NTA, its not like you divorced your first wife she died.

She destroyed physical memories that were important to you and that will almost certainly be important to your son one day, if not now. As someone who lost a parent at a young age, I cling deeply to the photos of my dad when he was happy and healthy. I think you need to talk to your son to see if she\u2019s engaged in any other toxic behaviors towards him specifically and have a long, hard think about whether this is someone you really want in his life.

I wanted to get away from it as it was hard for me to remain there. However, I carried everything else with me, including my first wedding photograph, and other pictures of her.\n\nEmily was against the idea as she said that the whole point of moving elsewhere to start afresh, and that I should not be carrying pictures of my former wife as it shows that  I am still latching onto her or something. I refused by pointing out that I do not want to do that. She argued, but in the end she gave in, or so I thought.\n\nYesterday, Emily approached me and said that she doesn't think I'd have any issues related to Sarah any longer.\n\nI asked her what she meant, and she said  that while I was at work, she and Hannah took the opportunity to throw away the wedding photograph and other stuff I had of Sarah. She wanted to \"come clean\" about it or something.\n\nI was flabbergasted, and we got into a really large argument, and I called her a \"goddamn country w\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\", among other words.
