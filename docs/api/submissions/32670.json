My first child is John (13 M) through my former wife.\n\nWe recently moved to a new house as we were previous living in the same house where my first wife Sarah and I used to live at. I wanted to get away from it as it was hard for me to remain there. However, I carried everything else with me, including my first wedding photograph, and other pictures of her.\n\nEmily was against the idea as she said that the whole point of moving elsewhere to start afresh, and that I should not be carrying pictures of my former wife as it shows that  I am still latching onto her or something. I refused by pointing out that I do not want to do that. She argued, but in the end she gave in, or so I thought.\n\nYesterday, Emily approached me and said that she doesn't think I'd have any issues related to Sarah any longer.\n\nI asked her what she meant, and she said  that while I was at work, she and Hannah took the opportunity to throw away the wedding photograph and other stuff I had of Sarah. She wanted to \"come clean\" about it or something.\n\nI was flabbergasted, and we got into a really large argument, and I called her a \"goddamn country w\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\", among other words. In the end, she was saying that I should not be having such photographs of other women in the first place, and that she only wanted the best for her daughter and herself. She's not talking to me now (is giving me the silent treatment), and Hannah's very upset as well.

Because this is crazy land.", "NTA\n\n>that she only wanted the best for her daughter and herself.\n\nI don't understand how getting rid of photos of your late wife is what's best for her and her daughter. Actually... I think I can figure out her very flawed logic. Emily did this to stake her claim on you. She's sees you as her possession and tossed the photos in an attempt to win against a woman who isn't even around anymore.", "NTA MASSIVE RED FLAG!  This is one of the most telling, obvious, and consistent red flags you can find in new marriages/relationships, especially blended families. She will try to push herself onto your son as a mother and alienate him from you both, or simply intentionally alienate him from both of you since he is the \"other woman's\" child. She WILL play favorites with the kids, I can bet you that. For your own son's sake, you MUST end this nonsense now.\n\nShe does not care about what you or your son think. She does not care about how you and your son feel. Those were photos of the mother of your child, not an Ex you broke up with. I would suggest immediately leaving her. It may seem drastic, but no one who behaves like this should be trusted in any capacity.\n\nIf you love your son at all, get your photos out of the trash and walk away.", "Info: how long were you a widow before you remarried?\n\nI'm just curious. Tbh marrying somebody that has no respect for your first wife, your son's mom, makes no sense to me. Seems divorce worthy to me.", "Assuming this is real, your wife is the AH. You are NTA.\n\nYou have a son. Your son, I'm sure, would have loved that album in the future. It was not hers to destroy or get rid of.\n\nQuite honestly, this is where you call the police for theft, file a report for the theft and divorce. What she did... that is incredibly destructive to your CHILD. \n\nHer wanting the best for her and her daughter has nothing to do with a box of photos. They do not impact her. THey do impact YOUR child and his link to his mother.", "NTA\n\nThis would be a deal breaker for me. There's nothing wrong with saving photos of your late wife, for your son if nothing else. It speaks volumes that she only wants the best for herself and her daughter, leaving your feelings and that of your son out of her equation.\n\nI'm so sorry. I can't imagine how she thought she had the right to do this.", "NTA. Your sons mother is DEAD. These items are memories your son could have kept to have something of both his parents together. Your now wife is incredibly selfish and jealous of a dead woman. How long has your wife been gone? You and your son are still grieving as it can take years to come to terms with things like this. Your wife is telling you point blank that she thinks only of herself and the daughter. Your poor son now has to suffer because of this. She clearly is not acting with care towards your son and how something like this could impact him.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nEmily is the asshole here.

This is not alright and will cause permanent damage to him. You need to think about him first in this situation. She did this not only to you but to him. She took every last momnto of his deceased mother and destroyed it. As someone who lost a parent young, this can feel like losing the parent all over again. Stop what ever you are currently do and go take care of him, make him your priority and do what ever he needs, and one of those things is keep your new wife away from him, because in some ways she just rekilled his mother.", "OP if she does this to the photos imagine how she treats your son when you are not there, and she even invilved her daughter in this crazy jealusy.\n\nNTA, talk to your son", "NTA.

Honestly, you could have called her every swear word in the book and you still wouldn\u2019t be an asshole. \n\nShe destroyed your property and photos that held memories dear to you and your son.

You can\u2019t recreate pictures or rebuy those gifts. \n\nI hope you had some of them elsewhere or had negatives/digital copies to print. \n\nI would very much be divorcing someone who did this, especially since she didn\u2019t do it alone.

She just threw away photos of *his mother*. \nYou have a responsibility to protect your son, and anyone callous and jealous enough to do something like this does not have your son's best interest at heart.

It's not like you divorce. She f-ing DIED! This isn't the first time I have heard of this happening and honestly your comments were tame compared to what I would've said. I am not sure your new marriage can survive this. Get into couples counseling now if you want any chance of moving forward. She needs help to uncover why she is so threatened by a dead woman. NTA.", "NTA- I do not blame you for one second for using that language to her. She threw away something special to you, something that would've been special to your son.

I'm so sorry to you and your son for everything that happened. I hope things get better for you two.", "If it was a case of A) you\u2019d just broke up and she was still alive or B) there wasn\u2019t your son and you just wanted to keep her memory around then maybe it would be alright to want her out of your life, destroying the photos would never be ok under case B tho. \n\nBut the fact you have your son who may want to know about is mother or may want to see pictures that makes this act incredibly selfish and horrible and if it was me I wouldn\u2019t be able to stay with her after it, absolutely not the asshole", "This would be the end of the relationship for me.

And she never will. \n\nShe is so insecure that she threw out pictures of a woman who is no longer her, and cannot possibly be a threat to your marriage.  She threw out your memories as though they were unimportant.  And she threw out your son's only pictures of his mom. Those wedding pictures likely showed her at her happiest, too!\n\nShe had her daughter help, too? Like she is teaching her daughter it is okay to disregard you (and others) in order to meet her own wants and needs? How she did not even think about your son wanting those pictures is unbelievable. They could have been just in a box in the attic until he was grown up and moved out.\n\nThink about whether you want this woman policing the rest of your life. Watch how she treats your son. And know he is hurt too, by her actions. This also cost him something he can't get back. Please look out for him through this too. \n\nYour wife is not combining families.

My first child is John (13 M) through my former wife.\n\nWe recently moved to a new house as we were previous living in the same house where my first wife Sarah and I used to live at. I wanted to get away from it as it was hard for me to remain there. However, I carried everything else with me, including my first wedding photograph, and other pictures of her.\n\nEmily was against the idea as she said that the whole point of moving elsewhere to start afresh, and that I should not be carrying pictures of my former wife as it shows that  I am still latching onto her or something. I refused by pointing out that I do not want to do that. She argued, but in the end she gave in, or so I thought.\n\nYesterday, Emily approached me and said that she doesn't think I'd have any issues related to Sarah any longer.\n\nI asked her what she meant, and she said  that while I was at work, she and Hannah took the opportunity to throw away the wedding photograph and other stuff I had of Sarah. She wanted to \"come clean\" about it or something.\n\nI was flabbergasted, and we got into a really large argument, and I called her a \"goddamn country w\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\", among other words. In the end, she was saying that I should not be having such photographs of other women in the first place, and that she only wanted the best for her daughter and herself.

NTA at all. Please put your son first as you proceed. These people aren\u2019t going to.", "Omg.  U r not seeing reality. She doesn't care about your son. Her will be queen and your child dirt. Dump her", "I hope you were able to retrieve them from the trash. That\u2019s your son\u2019s mom also. Your wife sounds awful.", "Were the photos on the bedside table, or hanging in the house? In a box in the closet?\n\nI would expect my husband to keep photo memories of his late wife. I would not expect to look at their wedding pictures daily in my own bedroom.", "Yeah, no... he actions just aren't OK. Her thinking is wrong and incredibly creepy.\n\nI don't understand why you would marry a woman who was so intent on erasing your son's mother's existence.", ">I mean, she was saying that holding the photos show that I do not love her as much, and that I am clinging to the past or something. She said as I would not get rid of them, she had no choice but to throw them away to both help me and herself.\n\nSo she lied to you as well and is trying to gaslight you.\n\nShe is the problem, not you.\n\nDestroying photographs of your son's dead mother was highly abusive to your SON and you both. This woman is a danger to your son and your relationship with your son. Your son is also from your deceased wife.\n\n**YOU ARE FAILING TO PROTECT YOUR CHILD WHO HAS NO OTHER PARENT.**", "She\u2019s wrong, crazy and mean.", "It doesn\u2019t matter about you and your wives (although obviously you should keep the photos and she\u2019s insane), but now your son has no photos of his mother. What next - will he not allowed to talk about her?\n\nYou can\u2019t just erase pasts, and you should never attempt to with a happy one.\n\nNTA but close to being one for your seeming lack of consideration of how this affects your child.", "Bro those photos would be so important to your kid, this new wife sounds terrible. It\u2019s one thing if she was just an ex, but this is someone who was taken from you and is the mother of your child. Absurd for your new wife to act like this. \n\nI\u2019d honestly move on and just focus on your son", "The real takeaway here is that your son's feelings never entered into this equation at all.  It's only her feelings and how she perceived yours.  Even if you can forgive her, do you think your son can?  It would probably feel like a massive betrayal.", "This is called gaslighting.", "This is manipulative nonsense. I'm sorry, but this is a very bad sign, cliche bad, as in everyone on reddit knows where this will eventually go. This is classic narcissism. How *dare* she do that to you and your child?! Your SON is the one who will suffer under this relationship, quite obviously. I guarantee you she will play favorites and ruin your relationship with your son. You need to leave, this is a FAR bigger issue than you are treating it.", "I guess that's her bad for marrying a man who clearly has not moved on from his late spouse in the first place...\n\nYou certainly wouldn't catch me doing that.\n\nESH.", "You're always going to have an attachment to your late wife. That's the mother of your son. If Emily feels that strongly, then what's to stop her from turning her ire towards him? She's already shown she's willing to be cruel just to get what she wants.", "She's wrong. If she can't handle your past she shouldn't have married you. She destroyed memories of your son's mother. What she did was unforgivable. \n\nI hope you will do the right thing by your son and leave her. She and her daughter will make your son's life a nightmare.", "What about your son? Is that what\u2019s best for him? To have nothing left of his mother? Would your wife be happy if she died and your next wife threw away all her photos and left nothing for her daughter? Selfish, disrespectful, and uncaring\u2026", "But did she think of your son at all? She spoke about what she felt was best for her and her daughter. What about what was best for your son? She destroyed photos that were of your son's mother. Your son should be able to have these photos. Your wife had no right to destroy them. Her behavior will negatively affect your son. Honestly, if I were you, this behavior would be a deal breaker for me. I would definitely be looking at ending things.", "Tell her that it\u2019s best for your son if a selfish woman and her destructive brat of a child hadn\u2019t destroyed his mother\u2019s things, and that it\u2019s best for you to not be in a relationship with someone who thinks it\u2019s okay to compete with a dead woman. Tell her you only want what\u2019s best for your son and yourself. IM absolutely appalled at her behavior, my condolences for both you and your son on the loss of the physical representations of your late wife.", "A deceased spouse is not the same as an ex or \u2018other woman\u2019. \n\nMoving on does not mean you should erase them from your life or stop having love for them. It\u2019s also normal and fine to find love in a new partner while still having that live for the one you lost.\n\nIt\u2019s even worse that you shared a child who now lost some memories from his mother forever.\n\nFrom the way you described it you were taking a normal and healthy approach to your grieving and your current relationship.\n\nUnless information was left out, you\u2019re NTA and she is unhealthily jealous of a deceased woman.", "You are not wrong. You are only doing a normal thing and preserving a few memories of someone important to you and your son. Your current wife is awful and please remove yourself from her.", "Doesn't it make you wonder how she feels about your child? He's half of her after all. And she's already said she was only thinking of herself and her daughter. She didn't even think that maybe he would want to have his mothers wedding picture one day? Is she going to try and erase him too? I don't think I could stay with someone who has so little regard for a deceased person, a child that lost his mother and a man who lost his wife.", "Brother, if this is a true story and not rage bait then I think you need to do some serious soul searching here. Your current wife is manipulative and narcissistic and she is going to cause a lot of damage to your son, who has now lost his family photos of his dead mother. This isn\u2019t a healthy relationship by any stretch of the imagination. NTA", "wow insecure much?\n\nhow did your son react?", "Exactly! This is cliche to the point it is painful. He needs to flat out leave, you can fix things like this. If he continues the relationship he is only being a bad father.", "Tbh I would not like to imagine how I'd feel after my wife died. At the very least confused, overwhelmed and still required to be a person for the kiddo. Looking back do you think there were signs she always had such negative feelings towards your first wife? Or is it like, welp I'm done being understanding you should no longer have feelings!", "Please update us.  I am so concerned for your son.", "You got *married* two years after your wife died? How long after did you start dating this woman, and how long was your engagement? This seems incredibly rushed especially in your fragile emotional state, and with an attempt to blend two children. I\u2019m not trying to judge you personally, and what she did to you is totally unhinged and unforgivable. I just don\u2019t understand people\u2019s rush to trap yourself in a life with someone you barely know.", "Seems kinda fast", "Right? I'm a guy who has been cheated on in the past, and even I have never begrudged a partner of keeping photos of their life before they met me, whether or not they included the previous partner or not.\n\nWhat's even worse is how OP's wife is trying to put it on him as though he was doing something by keeping photos. I'd take it further and say that OP's wife will likely also target his son, since she's from his late wife as well.", "Right? Felt like deja vu for a second lol", "And she 'is the child of a peasant'.", "Police have argued multiple times in court that they have no duty to help or protect people, only document crimes. Since this is destruction of private property (a crime) police literally have nothing better to do.", "This is not a marital argument, this is destruction of property which is a crime.", "If it were me, I would divorce her. This is absurd that she threw away those photos. NTA", "Nah, very first sentence \"after the death of my first wife.\" I'd say that's pretty clear she died.", "Well said. It would break my heart and destroy any trust I had in the other person if someone did that to me.", "She is my mother in this case. In any event this is horrible and damaging behaviour that the son should not be subjected to", "So you look down on people from the country? Sounds like you might both suck.", "I agree but idk; I've had divorced friends (not like ops case) they did destroy the pics as it reminded them of the worst mistake of their lives.", "There is a balance to be had in this situation, which is what they found. If they were all over the house as she says, I can see why she would feel like she didn't belong there. The pictures aren't hidden. They were not shoved away into a box or thrown away. They are with the person they mean the most to, displayed for her to enjoy. It sounds like she was very happy for the daughter to have those memories.", "She deserves to be divorced, not called a whore. If that is his first instinct as an insult, it is problematic in general \n\nBut I also think it goes in ESH because they didn't sort all this out before marriage. He knows she was still against the idea but gave in. He chose to bring this woman into the home with his son knowing she wanted  to erase all memory and signs of his widow", "He isn't even remotely an AH.  She deserved it and much much worse.", "My husband never said a word until I straight up asked him. He never knew my first husband. Talking about him made him uncomfortable and it hurt him. I will occasionally make a reference to him now, (unintentionally) but I apologize and tell him I love him. Had he known him, I could understand him being more ok to talk about him because he was a funny guy and that's when I'll let it slip, talking about some goofy thing he did. The point is, before they moved, she had already expressed discomfort about it. That was when he should have started getting grief counseling if not sooner, like before the wedding. I wound up getting counseling. Either way, he still needs therapy.", "Of course the son should have those pictures. The wife was wrong to throw them out, full stop. No one is disagreeing that she\u2019s TA.\n\nOP\u2019s also TA for calling his wife a derogatory term. That is unacceptable language between spouses.", "you don\u2019t speak to people this way, especially if you\u2019re married trying to work through a huge marital issue. they\u2019re both toxic and terrible at handling their emotions.", "didn\u2019t ask but okay. his comment had nothing to do with the offense and is definitely gonna distract from the actual issue (her destroying his things) when they have a conversation about this.", "He isn't the AH in any way.", "Agreed. You\u2019re completely right! Thank you for the clarification!!", "Agreed. That was an absolutely evil thing of her to do.  Any person of decency would be livid on John's behalf.  The damage is irreparable even if the photos can be salvaged.", "Yeah, better get her out of the house fast, before she decides that getting rid of the son is also a good idea.", "Yeah, I could see her find ways to wedge the son out of their lives too.", "Exactly. How would she react if he threw out every single picture of her ex? Or any pictures from before they met?", "This is my view. I don't care about her jealousy issues. Your son has lost photos of his late mother. Your current wife has nothing to do with your son's relationship to his mum.", "No, I did not leave anything out. Except that I used the word \"country\" as she was brought up in a milk farm (not a city), and she said that it showed my privilege or something for using such a word?", "She's giving me the silent treatment, and Hannah's very upset as well. They were calling me names. Nothing has happened otherwise.", "Grief and recovery is different for everyone.\n\nAbsolutely not the issue here and not what OP should be even thinking about.", "Probably too fast for marriage, apparently too fast to realise how manipulative his new wife is. Grief makes people do weird things though.", "Men always replace you real quick.", "Yea think this Is one of those testers they throw out", "Yeah\u2026OP seriously adding context that \u201cshe is the child of a peasant\u201d is not it. Who tf describes people like that? I\u2019ve only ever read that in a shady Gen Z social media context.\n\nNTA because destroying the pics was extremely messed up, but I cringed reading the way you described her upbringing.", "I certainly don't, it's just what came to mind immediately.", "He was mad he knew she was from the country. That\u2019s what he said. It doesn\u2019t mean he hates people from the country.  Those are nice words compared to what I would\u2019ve called her.", "If you destroy the photos of your own wedding, that's OK. Destroying the photos of your new spouse's first wedding is always unacceptable.", "Divorce: totally ok\n\nCalling wife a whore: that\u2019s crossing the line\n\nYou really need to get your priorities straightened out\n\nNTA", "Grow up.", "Oh yeah all those things that happened in the past means you don't love her \ud83d\ude10", "Don\u2019t worry about what you called her. She doesn\u2019t deserve to object to anything you call her based on what she did. She IS a country woman. It\u2019s not even an insult!", "The country insult was a bit out of pocket, but said in the heat of a moment where you just found out she did something terrible and irreversible.\n\nWas it wrong? Yeah, but her action was *so* much worse.", "How did your son take this?  He should be the only person besides you whose opinion matters in this mess.  Your wife and stepdaughter sound like manipulating AHs.  This is not normal behavior.", "Mate. Self respect. That shit is so fucked. The fact that they did it as a pair makes it ritualistic to them.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting to maintain history. It doesn't make you less committed to the current.", "Why havent you left or kicked her out? She can go back to the milk farm. Your son is seeing all this play out and does not need this horrid woman around to try and get rid of him next.", "Divorce leave immediately", "I don't want to start a 'divorce her' chant, but couples counseling and/or family counseling would definitely be a place to start.", "Maybe a country vvh@r3 smelt weakness in a grieving man and capitalised", "How is this the guy's fault?", "Considering what she did, I'd call her worst. I think he's being way too nice about this.", "Y\u2019all are taking shit way out of context.  Grow up.", "What about your son ? How did he take it ?", "You went for brutal and she deserved it.", "Pretty good actually.  It doesn\u2019t really mean anything but adds a nasty edge to the overall insult.", "Yeah, sometimes when people get angry, they pick their insults on what they believe will hurt the person they're insulting the most.\n\nQuite frankly, I'd have thrown her out of the house for that.", "He was more than fine with me calling her those names as he was very upset himself.", "Well, I would be lying if I said that he did not like me calling her that. He was mad at her also, and supported everything I said."]}
