Sucks for your stepdaughter that she misses out but I get it.", "It is perfectly understandable that you don't want to be the one who has to deal with the child's unreasonable mother, nor should you have to.  Why is your boyfriend not taking his child to the birthday party?  He wants her to go, he can take her.  Not your circus, not your monkey.

It\u2019s her dad\u2019s time, so he decides. When I have my daughter, I don\u2019t ask her dad if we\u2019re \u201callowed\u201d to do things. He lives with his girlfriend and her kids and she never asks me for permission either. You both need to sort out this issue or it will only get worse.", "NTA, the mother will definitely dial up her pettiness if she finds out the daughter went even if your boyfriend okayed it. And the daughter will likely be talking about how fun the birthday party was so it will get back to the mother. Save yourself the headaches.", "NTA. sadly even though the dad told you yes it sounds like the mom would flip out on you and no one needs that in their life. So your looking out for yourself and thats completely understandable in this situation. nta", "NTA.  You're the one who bears the brunt of the criticism from her mother.

You are not the mom.", "YTA, so ex wife makes decisions in your house?", "YTA: but for one reason....you called her your stepdaughter. \n\nIf you see this child as your daughter your main priority should be to make her happy. If that means you have to deal with rude text messages it should be worth it to make your step daughter have a good day.

It's not like she's saying the kid couldn't go at all.", "Yes, this.", "She is her stepdaughter. It's a fact, not an insult", "Then your boyfriend shouldn't have told the child that she could go, if he wasn't able to take her.  He is using you to take the brunt of his ex's hostility and you are letting him do it.  Your family aren't any better.

So let\u2019s look at it this way. You\u2019re a single mom dating a guy. You\u2019re living with the guy. You ask him to take your kiddo to anything and he says \u201cno. Not without the dad\u2019s permission.\u201d What kind of a relationship do you think that is? Your own partner sees you as less of a parent and unable to make decisions bc\u2026the other parent. OP values the mom\u2019s opinion more than her own partner\u2019s opinion bc she doesn\u2019t want to deal with the mom. (She shouldn\u2019t be dealing with the mom. Her partner should be.) Either way\u2026I wouldn\u2019t be dating someone like this for very long bc she doesn\u2019t respect her partner.", "I told my boyfriend she\u2019s not going to the party without her mom\u2019s permission. That sounds like she\u2019s making decisions for daddy who has custody that weekend. She doesn\u2019t respect her partner. What he says doesn\u2019t matter to her.", "The first sentence says boyfriend not husband. So it's not a fact it's a choice. \n\nNow if she doesn't want to be a parent to this child and deal with co parenting, call it like it is , she's your boyfriend's daughter.", "Dad said she could go because it\u2019s his weekend and he gets to decide what she can/can\u2019t do.

OP is simply not getting involved in the mom/dad/kid drama.", "She\u2019s choosing to. That\u2019s why. If she were staying out of it all communication would be going through her partner.", "This exact situation where a mom is making her daughter miss a party due to being petty. Throw in the fact that it's the father's week and the father gave approval. Everyone would say not the asshole let the child go to the party. \n\nThere's no stepmother hate here.", "Dad's girlfriend is not a decision making role in his child's life.  She also doesn't have to deal with his ex... the ex is solely his responsibility and all communication about the child should be between him and his ex.  OP is not part of the co-parenting equation and should stay clear for her own sake.", "Actually OP is\u2026by telling her partner that she is going to follow the parent she\u2019s not screwing lol.", "She should just stay out of it and do what her partner says? Oh hell no.", "OP made it pretty clear that she's avoiding being the whipping post for the mother, since the father lets it happen.", "Then why is she in the relationship. If he doesn\u2019t stand up for her and let\u2019s her be a whipping post she\u2019s in an abusive relationship and needs to bail.", "Yes, she definitely IS in an abusive relationship."]}
