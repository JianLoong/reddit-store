The problem is my brother\u2019s new wife kate (28). They got married last year and I was happy about them, I really liked kate as we are same age and could relate to many things, until I realised she despises me and bad mouths me to our friends.\n\nAfter confronting kate about why she dislikes me she said that it\u2019s because I keep in touch with tom\u2019s ex-wife luana. The two of them divorced on good terms and has 50/50 custody of their kids, I still meet up with luana occasionally to plan things for the kids\u2019 birthdays and holidays - as luana and the kids are my family.\n\nkate complained about it to tom, to which he said he can\u2019t tell me what to do with my friendship with luana. Since then kate has done everything in her power to prevent me from meeting tom and his kids, i can only see them when they\u2019re staying with luana.\n\nWe have a tradition of family vacation each may, tom was invited to come with kate and they did. Kate knows I\u2019m allergic to pineapple, but she still mixed the cocktails with pineapple juice. She said it\u2019s orange juice so I took a sip and immediately felt how it burned down my throat. I ended up in hospital getting a drip and holidays being cut short because of that. Kate claims she didn\u2019t knew I was allergic to anything and that she genuinely thought it\u2019s orange juice but i beg to differ. My mom and tom are on her side however, saying it was a genuine mistake. I only drank it in the first place, because i could have never thought that she will try to kill me.\n\nA couple of weeks ago i found kate parked in my driveway, she gave me an earful about how awful of a person i am for not accepting her into the family fully. I told her i did when we first met, but i don\u2019t see her as family anymore after how she treated me and she went hysterical so i had to call tom to pick her up. \n\nI\u2019m getting married in December and my fianc\u00e9 hates kate for what she did to me, so we decided it\u2019s the best thing to not invite her at all. My mom called me and told me to grow up after she found out kate isn\u2019t invited. Tom begged me to invite her too as he doesn\u2019t want to come if kate isn\u2019t going. He said I\u2019m straining his new marriage and i do feel really bad about it. \n\nKate came over to me after getting the invitation and realising she wasn\u2019t there and called me and my fianc\u00e9 a \u201ccouple of assholes\u201d. She said how i should understand her better and love her more and cried but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to feel one bit sorry.\n\nI told them it\u2019s OUR wedding and we get to decide who is invited and who\u2019s not, my fianc\u00e9 is 100% with me on this but after being bombarded with calls from mom, tom, kate and our friends for a few days now I\u2019m starting to overthink.\n\nAm I really the asshole because i don\u2019t want kate to be around me on my wedding?", "created_utc": 1694736654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16iyc9o/aita_for_not_inviting_my_sisterinlaw_to_my_wedding/", "score": 480, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kate sent you to the hospital.  She shouldn't be at your wedding because she's not a safe person for you to be around.\n\nYour brother's marriage *should* be strained because his wife is doing things like trying to hurt you and coming between his sister and him/his children.  It's not on you to suck it up so that he doesn't have to face the way his wife is acting.  If he's going to stick with her, then he's going to have to suffer the consequences of her behavior.", "NTA - Kate doesn't get to decide who your friends are, or who you invite to your wedding. Hopefully your mom can eventually understand that, and hopefully Tom starts to see all the red flags Kate is throwing. Glad to hear your fiance has your back!", "NTA, you welcomed her nicely into the family, getting along with her. She simply has difficulties accepting her new husband's ex wife (and more importantly mother of her step children) is still part of the family. Although we don't know why they split up in the first place.\n\nComing to your wedding, it it yours, so you can choose who you want to invite. It sucks for your brother, but considering what she has done to you, it is understandable that you dont feel comfortable with her on your big day.", "File a police report on Kate for the pineapple juice incident.  Nothing will come out of it but it will double down on how serious you are about her trying to hurt you.\n\nI assume Luana is coming to your wedding. It would be awful if Kate showed up and started drama.", "NTA. Someone who hates you enough to try to physically harm you doesn\u2019t belong at your wedding. She is a manipulative liar and you don\u2019t need to deal with it. Don\u2019t feel bad about it, she made her choices and here come the consequences.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you want someone so toxic at your wedding? \n\nInvite your ex-SIL when you invite the niblings. . She'll probably be thrilled to attend an be much less dramatic.\n\nJust be aware, that if she isn't invited your brother probably won't be there either. Their married, it's a package.   \n\nHow disappointing that your family cannot see this Jezebel for her true self.", "NTA- I am deathly allergic to pineapple too, and she tried to KILL you! \nYour brother, SiL, and Mom ARE the AH\u2019s. The fact that they continue to ignore her childish and dangerous behavior would be enough for me to only do basic family things. Keep seeing the ex wife and the kids- she seems like a grownup.", "NTA.  The second wives' club is not for the faint of heart.  Kate is an AH.  Ignore her from now on.  Work with Luana to have time with children.  Eventually, they will be old enough to 'dump' Kate also, if she is still around.", "NTA \n\nWe do not negotiate with terrorists.", "NTA. Explain to her flying monkeys that she either intentionally or unintentionally poisoned you. She's also been super toxic simply because you're still friends with your brother's ex. Let them know she will not be attending your wedding and if she immediately apologizes it will still take you a long time to forgive her. If she doesn't then you are cutting off your brother, mother and anyone else who keep trying to get to apologize to the person who literally poisoned you and caused you to end up in the hospital. \n\nTell them the next time they speak to you about her it will be a three month block of no contact. The next will result in a six month block of no contact and the third time a year. Encourage them to make a good decision for themselves. \n\nHeads up, this woman will kill you with her nonsense if she gets half a chance. She's already proven that. NTA.", "NTA. Seems like there is a high likelihood she will cause some sort of drama at your wedding, it is not worth the risk to invite her even for the sake of family peace.", "NTA.\n\nWedding invitations are given to those who the happy couple feel close to and want to celebrate their day with. Kate has bad mouthed you to friends and put your life in danger. If anything, she hasn't accepted you as family.

Maybe you'll get lucky and Kate will be out the door before the wedding.  NTA.", "Wow.  That's a lot to unpack.  NTA at all and I think you are doing the right thing.", "NTA - you don't have to invite an asshole to your wedding. \n\nIf you want to try to make amends for your brother's sake, you could offer to meet with her to clear the air and explain that just because Tom got divorced doesn't mean you are supposed to hate his ex; adult relationships don't work like that. If anything it's far healthier for everyone to remain on good terms and be friends (especially for the kids)! Lay down some boundaries and explain that if she breaks them, you're done. You've done all you can do.\n\nDepending on when the wedding is, if she can muster up some maturity before then, maybe she gets an invite, but you're not an AH either way.\n\nP.S. All of this is assuming she really did just make a mistake regarding the pineapple juice. If you legit think she gave it to you on purpose, I'd either \"be friends\" to keep an eye on her (keep enemies close and all that) or cut her out as much as possible.", "NTA\n\nKate literally tried to kill you. And also you're not straining your brother's marriage, Kate is destroying the marriage from the inside just by hating you.\n\nYou might want to consider going NC with your mother, Kate, and Tom (unfortunately)", "NTA, she literally poisoned you.  This hill is worth dying on.\n\nYour brother is free to not attend the wedding, but you cannot have Kate there.  She is not safe.", "Tell them all to fuck off. They're really leaving you no choice.", "Wtf why would you want someone there that nearly killed you ??\n\nSeriously be the ass in this case if you need to keep her away", "NTA. Why would you want someone that hates you that much at your wedding? Who wants to spend their special day worrying they might be poisoned again? \n\nThere is nothing wrong with you taking an active role in those kids\u2019 lives and being respectful and inclusive to the mother of his children in the process, full stop. And the fact that your brother is not immediately shutting her behavior down is beyond absurd. \n\nThe only reason his new marriage is strained is because your brother married a woman who is incredibly insecure about the fact his ex-wife is still in his life. But, whether Kate likes it or not, Luana is always going to be tied to her Tom and the children. Even if their relationship had ended on bad terms; she would still be in his life because they have children.\n\nSorry to say, but for your own safety and mental health; it\u2019s time to go no contact with your brother. You only see the kids through Luana at this point anyways, so it\u2019s not like you\u2019d be losing contact with the people that matter. Your brother can blame you until he\u2019s blue in the face, but the reality is, Kate is not going to end her rampage until his ex (and likely the kids) are completely out of the picture. \n\nAnd frankly, if Tom and Kate think your behavior is so terrible and toxic, and you\u2019ve ruined your relationship with her by excluding her from the family; it\u2019s really interesting they are so consumed with being at an event celebrating you. One might wonder if, without you as a scapegoat, there\u2019s trouble in paradise. Again, NTA, please go enjoy your day without fear of being murdered.", "Honestly OP? I think it is time to invite your brother out to lunch and have a very serious conversation with him about her abusive behavior and the fact that if she flipped on you she will do it to his kids. Emphasize the fact that her behavior towards you has been highly abusive and you recommend setting cameras up at home so he can run feed if she is alone with the kids. The very fact that she thought it acceptable to slip you pineapple should have ended that relationship dead. He should have walked away from that psychopath at that moment and time. If she flipped on you she will flip on one of the children at some point.", "NTA - keep in touch with the ex (invite her to the wedding), cut off your brother and his latest wife. Oh and tell your mom to shut it or she's not invited either.", "NTA. Holy hell, she bloody well tries to kill you and you are supposed to just let it go? Your family sucks.", "I can't say that she literally tried to kill you; but she definitely wanted to hurt you. \n\nNTA and your family are full of AH's for coddling her.", "Um, she literally tried to kill you? In the exact same way someone is killed in Glass Onion btw!! Great movie, but should not be your real life. You're NTA and she should literally never be around you again.", "ESH.\n\nKate is clearly terrible. We don\u2019t need to go in to why because anyone who read the post can figure it out.\n\nYou suck because inviting your brother to your wedding but not inviting his wife really doesn\u2019t fly. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s his crazy girlfriend - he married her. You don\u2019t really get to pick & choose between wanting your brother to come & saying, \u2018but your wife can\u2019t!\u2019 It puts your brother in a terrible situation & puts your parents in a terrible situation. While I am almost always on the side of, \u2018it\u2019s your wedding, invite whomever you want\u2019 there is a point at which you don\u2019t really have as much choice unless you want to elope or have a wedding so small that it\u2019s your parents & his.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t make sense that anyone believes you can mix up orange juice & pineapple juice. They are not the same colour. They don\u2019t smell the same. The labels are different. I don\u2019t understand how she mixed cocktails that this group all drank & not one of them realised, \u2018oh, pineapple\u2026 uh-oh\u2026\u2019 I\u2019m sorry, that bit of the story isn\u2019t quite adding up. Even while it was happening, this seems hard to believe.", "ESH.  I mean, you're NTA for feeling the way you do, but this is your *brother's wife* and she's going to be *part of the family for ever*.

And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again and again and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.\n\nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.\n\nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize.

He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him how to swim, either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did.\n\nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\n\nNow you and your SO get a boat of your own. With your SO not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder. \n\nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!\n\nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and SO see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.\n\nYou know what would be easier?
