He's never been in the picture for either of our girls after that.\n\nWhen April was 16, she unexpectedly got pregnant. I took her to counselling to help her organise her thoughts and figure out what she wanted to do, and April decided she wanted to keep the baby.\n\nThe pregnancy and birth went smoothly and I now have a grandson Ollie [m2]. The father is involved but he and April are no longer together. Ollie stays with his dad every weekend, and the dad's parents give April money to go towards Ollie's expenses.\n\nEarlier this year, April graduated high school. She's been taking care of Ollie during the week but other than that she hasn't been up to much. She keeps saying she'll start looking for a job but hasn't even started writing her resume.\n\nBesides taking care of Ollie, she just sits at home watching TV. On multiple occasions, April has tried to leave Ollie with Jade so that she can go out partying which has to lead to huge arguments.\n\nLast week, I talked to April and I told her that she needs to get a job or go to our local community college, and that I'll foot the bill for any childcare she needs for it to happen. I told her she needs to get a job or go to college in order to stay here.\n\nApril got upset and said that she doesn't want a job or to go to college, she said she just wants to be a mom. She told me it can wait until Ollie starts school. I told her no and that she needs to start something so that she can support herself and be an independent adult.\n\nApril said I'm being unreasonable and that these things can wait until Ollie is in school full-time. She said that I'm asking her to \"damage\" him and that he needs his mom.\n\nIt's not that I don't want April and Ollie here, I love them both, I just think I'd be setting a bad precedent by allowing April to continue to stay with me with no job and no education in the making.", "created_utc": 1670951916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl14fe/aita_for_telling_my_18_yo_daughter_she_needs_to/", "score": 307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter had a baby and needs to understand - FULL STOP - that she doesn't just get to be a mom. She's single and living at home with her own mother.   She's being unreasonable, selfish and lazy to expect you to support her while she lazes around unemployed until her child gets to school age.", "NTA. She chose to have this baby, so she should be providing for him. That's, like, bare minimum when it comes to being a parent.", "NTA. She doesn't get to just sit around doing nothing on your dime. You are absolutely right. It's time for her to grow up and honestly you're making it super easy on her by offering to pay for child care, because even that isn't real life. You are doing the right thing. Stick to your guns.", "NTA- April needs to work to support herself and she's just wasting time that could be used either to work herself up in a job or to get educated. \n\nI would tell her, sure, I'd love to sit around and watch TV all day too, but it's a good thing for you I don't. Let me be clear- I'm not asking. You aren't unique. Single moms everywhere go to work to support their kids. Ollie will be just fine. Also, since you're acting like a child, I'm banning you from the TV. Also, Jade will be paid to babysit. If you can't afford her, then don't ask her. You need to own up to your responsibilities.", "Your daughter wants to have her cake, and eat it too. \n\nYou asking her to work and contribute to the household is not unreasonable. I'm sure her exes custody funds some of your grandchild's needs, but not all. Which is where your daughter has to come in and provide the rest. \n\nNTA", "NTA She's getting to the point where she's now tryna ditch the kid to go and party it up. BS, she needs to get her sh!t together and stop acting like an immature brat. Plus being a SAHM requires being married to partner who can afford it and leaving a kid behind with her minor sister to drink and drug it up and possibly wind up pregnant again is more damaging to a toddler than going to daycare while she prioritizes bettering her life for the both of them.", "NTA\u2026 unfortunately being a SAHM is a privilege that only some people can afford. She clearly cannot. \nI think the only way you\u2019re going to be able to get through to her is to \u201ckick her out\u201d. I don\u2019t know what country you\u2019re in so not sure whether council housing is an option. \nShe is taking advantage of you because you\u2019re her mum and she expects you to care for her forever.", "NTA. Your daughter needs to take responsibility for her actions. Either get a job or go to school. Those are basic rules for adult children living at home, add the extra child, and this seems like an IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENT. You are not responsible for continuing to be solely responsible for the financial care for your adult child and her child. She isn't being fair to you, she is taking advantage.", "NTA. She doesn't get to be a SAHM while you foot all the bills. She needs a reality check. She wanted to be a mom? Cool, she needs to be a responsible adult and provide for herself and child.", "NTA. April needs to support her and Ollie and having a job or going to college is doing that. Right now she\u2019s using her son as an excuse to not do anything.", "NTA. Your kid made a decision to have sex and it ended in a pregnancy, you were nice enough to help her out while she was still in high school, but she is now 18, and an adult. She needs to suck it up and get a job or go to school. Being a single stay at home mom isn\u2019t a thing, she needs to get her priorities straight.", "NTA. She's an adult. Your requests are perfectly reasonable. Most community colleges offer online classes, maybe she can start with a couple of those.", "NTA, your daughter has a 2 year old child yet acts like one herself. Teen pregnancy makes me so sad", "NTA, stand firm, she's a mom, she's old enough to learn she needs to support her baby", "NTA\n\nYoung single parents do not get the luxury of being a SAHP. \n\nMany community colleges have childcare available for students. She should look into that.", "NTA. You're being amazing by offering to pay her childcare while she gets back on her feet.

If she just sits around doing nothing for another few years, she is just falling farther and farther behind, and if she loses the financial support she is getting, she will have nothing to fall back on.  \n\nIt seems pretty reasonable for her to start work or school, maybe just part time for now, but then she will at least be making some progress towards independence.  A lot of schools offer online classes now, so maybe that would work as a place to start. \n\nSeems like she needs some tough love.", "NTA\n\nIt's nice of you to pay for childcare. You could kick her out and then she'd really need to get a job, so you're doing a good job as a parent by both supporting her and giving her a gentle push out the nest.", "NTA\n\nIf she can go out partying with friends, she can get a job or go to college. It's not remotely fair for your younger daughter, or you, to be her babysitter so she can party.\n\nIf she wanted to party, she never should have had a baby.\n\nIt sounds like she really wanted to be a SAHM. But that's not possible, so it's very reasonable to insist she do one of those things to continue living with you.\n\nShe should be very thankful you're not charging her some rent.", "NTA at all. OP, actually you would be TA if you let daughter do what she wants until her son goes to school. Be firm and do not enable her irresponsibility.", "NTA. She doesn't get to be just a mom, that's not how it works.", "She needs to start setting the right examples for Ollie... Work habits and work ethic take years to develop...and by being a stay at home potato she is the one damaging him.", "NTA\n\nYour child needs to start the path to being able to be an independent single mother.   Hopefully she never has to be without her support network, but it could happen and she needs to have her act together so she can deal with it if it does.", "NTA\n\nOllie is old enough to spend time with other children in a care setting now.  Your requirement that she either get a job or go to school is VERY reasonable.    \nApril made a child.  She is an adult.  She is responsible for caring for, including PAYING for, her child.  Your offer to assist with child care while she either works or goes to school is more than many parents offer.", "NTA but give her a clear deadline so she knows you're serious. Don't let her steamroll you otherwise you'll be taking care of her forever.", "NTA. You want her to take initiative and create a life that\u2019s good for her and her son. You took care of her through her pregnancy and the rest of high school as her mother, and it\u2019s time for her to get out there and work. My friend had a baby at 15, and she busted her ass, with family support too, and became a lawyer to be able to support her child and herself. Not everyone has to push to become a lawyer, but it\u2019s time. It\u2019s time for your daughter to make a life for herself, even if it is hard, and even if it is scary.", "NTA. Tell her that staying at home is for married women with wealthy husbands only. There is no other scenario where this type of family model is realistic or acceptable", "She is lucky to have you helping with childcare.  NTA.", "NTA. She decided to be a teen mom so she needs to take full responsibility of him. She can\u2019t be a sahm because her and her son are not your responsibility. Getting a job or going to school are her best options unless she goes and lives with the father together or not.", "NTA \n\n**There is a massive difference between supporting someone and enabling their selfishness!** \n\nYou are offering to pay for childcare while she goes to school, that is already above and beyond supportive. She needs to get a grip.", "NTA. \n\nShe expects other people to fully support her for the next 3 years? She definitely needs a wake up call, and Ollie needs a mom who lives in the real world, not the fantasy one where she gets to sit around while everyone else supports her. \n\nShe can absolutely get a weekend job for when Ollie is with his Dad. You were very generous to offer to pay for child care so she could get a job or go to school as well. \n\nAnd you are doing a disservice to her by letting her sit around all day and not be building any future, skills, or just an understanding of what it means to be an adult. \n\nTell her she needs to get a job for when Ollie isn't with her, end of story. And stop paying for any non essentials if she refuses. She needs to see actual consequences, because she is clearly living in a fantasy world.", "NTA, you're offering her a great deal. Childcare paid for so she can go to school.", "Ollie needs a lot. One of the things  he needs is a functional adult as a mom. Yes, school or job, staying  mentally 16 is not going  to be a good plan.", "NTA. She made the grownup choice to be a mom and now needs to make the grownup choice to get herself to the point where she can support the child she has.  She gave up the right to stay at home doing nothing when she had that baby.  You've been more than generous to allow her and your grandson to stay in your home rent-free and to provide for childcare while she works or educates herself.  I'd put a finite time limit on when you expect the job or school to start and stick to my guns.  April needs to grow up in a big way.", "NTA. It seems like she\u2019s using Ollie as an excuse. But if she can go out partying and hang out with her friends, she can get a job or go to school.\n\nIf she really is that concerned with leaving him alone, maybe you can compromise and she can get a job/go to school part time.\n\nShe\u2019s very lucky because it seems like you\u2019re a good grandson to him. She has free child care, no bills, she has it made", "NTA - Obviously it\u2019s hard been a teen mom, but that\u2019s what she chose. The deck is stacked against her. Her chances of academic or professional success are statistically very low, but they\u2019re zero if she doesn\u2019t even try. No I don\u2019t blame you at all for wanting her to try to beat the odds. She\u2019d also probably be a lot better off going to college than getting a part time minimum wage job \u2014 assuming you think she\u2019ll be able to finish her degree.", "NTA.  April has chosen a tough road in life, and absolutely needs skills and education to provide for herself and her son.  You are correct to require her to progress in her life.", "NTA. She made adult decisions about sex and raising a kid. She needs to continue to make adult decisions about how she's going to provide for her kid in the long term. To be blunt, you are not going to be around forever plus you have Jade to raise. \n\nThe choices you gave her are good, positive choices, and you offered to pay for child care. Ollie interacting with kids early in life is not going to damage him, it will help him develop socialization skills.", "NTA - While she has a lot going on for a teenager, there is no free lunch.  She needs to provide for her child for the next 16 years at minimum.  That means getting an education or skilled profession now.  \n\nYes it is a lot of adulting and  seems a stark contrast to her same age peers.  But that's reality.  She could still get a job that works weekends, when the dad has the child, and three weekdays which still gives her two days off with the kid.  Or she can do college but only take classes on certain days.  \n\nI agree that with this child being a toddler she doesn't get to be a NEET.  She's asking for a luxury most older parents in most nations don't have.", "NTA\n\nBeing a SAHM isn't just \"being at home watching TV all day\" or \"all the free time in the world to play\". It is also taking care of the house while being a mom. A lot of that invisible labor in the form of domestic chores and parenting that people generally don't think about when they think about work. April isn't a SAHM, she's a leech who doesn't take care of her kid and tries to act like a carefree teenager", "NTA, April is being highly irresponsible: she needs to be able to support her son, and not expect to live off others for free. By not undertaking paid employment or attending community college, she is teaching her son that having a lack of work ethic is acceptable. The irony of her saying she wants to be a mom is that she contradicts herself when she exploits her sister to baby sit, so that she can party. I use the word \"exploit\" because she is taking advantage of her young sister to be frivolous and forget her responsibility.\n\nYou'll have to give her an ultimatum either she gets a job, even just part time, go to community college (which you've said you'll fund), or she finds somewhere else to live. Tell your daughter if she can't take adult responsibilities, she shouldn't make adult decisions such as have unprotected sex, etc. Yes it is harsh but she is shying away from her responsibilities and taking advantage of yours and her sister's good nature.", "NTA\n\nA SAHM isnt dependant upon her own Mom to foot the bill of her and her childs necessities, especially when the father is paying child support.\n\nIf she wants to be a SAHM, then she can move into her own place and pay her own utilities and food etc. And then maybe she will understand that what you are providing for her is very generous. \n\nYou are being more than reasonable, and in fact in offering to pay daycare so she can go to school or get a job, you are being very generous!\n\nI agree with you, she needs to do something other than take care of a 2 year old and watch TV all day.", "NTA.\n\nThe current status of her life does not allow April to be a stay-at-home mom. You are being more then generous in offering to help pay for her childcare, and it's very bold of her to say she just wants to be a mom when she's trying to foist Ollie off on her little sister. It sounds like what April really wants is to be a typical teenager with 0 responsibility. I don't blame her for that, but its' frankly not the reality she lives in.\n\nIt sounds like you are doing your best to be a good mom, and keep sticking to your guns on April getting some kind of job or education.", "NTA\n\nI never finished high school because I had a child at 16 and had to get a job. She is lucky that she was able to graduate.\n\nShe is 18 now. She is technically an adult, so yes she needs a job or college. Otherwise, she is going to stay with you forever.\n\nStand firm. This was her choice and now she needs to learn how to be a parent and an adult.", "NTA and there\u2019s PLENTY of online schools that are accredited she can go to.", "NTA\n\nYou're offering a lot of help and support, both financial and emotional. You're trying to help April in the long term.  She could also find a PT weekend job in the meantime.", "NTA. She is acting very childish, that's because she's still a kid - that has a kid.", "NTA. If she wants to be a SAHM then she needs to find a wealthy-enough partner who consents to that decision. If she is dependent on you for her livelihood, then she can follow your guidelines.\n\nOut of curiosity: Is there a compromise? Would you accept her working part-time and working her way up to a full-time job? Is the expectation that she financially contribute to the household or you're just trying, as a mother, to get her off the couch for her own good?", "NTA, she needs to work on supporting herself.", "NTA. Stand your ground!", "NTA\n\n>Last week, I talked to April and I told her that she needs to get a job or go to our local community college, and that I'll foot the bill for any childcare she needs for it to happen.\n\nApril clearly doesn't realise just how generous an offer this is. Childcare costs are absolutely *astronomical* and she certainly wouldn't be able to afford it on her own. What you're proposing will help her hugely in bettering herself without ending up in financial difficulties, which is a prospect a lot of teenage mothers without financial support face.\n\nSo yeah, she made the decision to have her child, now she has to take the necessary steps to provide for him as the adult she is.", "NTA, put your foot down abs don\u2019t cave. You let her finish school which was important plus she was still a legally dependent minor herself. Unfortunately she still have the mentality of a minor. She\u2019s only 18 so, that\u2019s to be expected, not accepted. When she\u2019s saying \u201cit can wait\u201d what she means is mom, keep working abs eating Money to subsidize me until I feel ready to work. Which will be never.", "NTA. That\u2019s just not how life works. April made the grown up decision to have a child, now she must deal with the grown up consequences of that decision. And at any rate now that Olllie is 2, daycare will be good for him. He\u2019ll be able to socialize with other children and learn how to behave in a classroom setting before going to school.", "NTA. \n\nI was apprehensive when I started reading the title but it's not an unreasonable request. Community college or job would help her in the long run. You can't keep providing for your daughter and your grandchild forever.", "NTA.  You can't be a stay at home single mom, that just isn't how the world works as much as she'd like to will it to be that way.", "NTA. I had my son at 17. I graduated early, went to college, got a degree and a career. I was never allowed to sit at home, I had to work, I moved out at 18, and took care of myself and my child. \n\nApril is lazy AF. And it will only get worse if she doesn\u2019t get her butt into gear now and do something so she can provide for her child later.", "NTA. \n\nShe's 18. At 18 it's reasonable to expect a child to do work or school if they want to continue living free in the family home. Something showing some type of intent to be able to support themselves eventually. She has extra reason to do that since she has a child relying on her. \n\nYou're offering to cover childcare expenses, and assuming you're offering *decent* childcare and not a scary cheap unlicensed daycare, you're removing the main obstacle most young parents have with working or continuing their education. \n\nSo... yeah. I really don't see how you're an AH here. Ollie isn't your child, you never agreed to support a SAHM situation for his mom/your daughter, so that being what she *wants* isn't really relevent. If that's what she *wants* she has to find someone willing (and able) to support that, which you aren't.", "NTA. She needs to own her choices. No one owes her a free ride. She is owed child support from the father and that is it. \n\nThe longer she is out of the job market w/o going to school, the more her eventual ernings will be \"put back\". The job opportunities for a 21 yr old w/o any schooling or college are pretty limited. Anyone else her age will have work experience or a degree or often both. She is messing up her future and expecting you will always puck up the slac for her. She needs a serious reality check.", "NTA. In order for her to \u201cjust be a mom\u201d, she needs someone to foot the bill. And not just baby\u2019s expenses but full adult bills. She can\u2019t expect you to house and feed her forever. What you are doing is being a parent to her and teaching her how to be a functional adult.", "NTA. It\u2019s not even about setting a bad precedent. This is HER son, not yours. HER responsibility, not yours. The fact that you\u2019re willing to take care of childcare so she can go to college is very generous, and she should absolutely take the offer.", " NTA. I get not every 18 year old is ready for college, but she also has a baby\u2019s future to consider along with her own. CC would be the best option and work towards an associate degree in something she finds interesting. If not she needs to find a job. But not going to school and not having a job \u201cuntil Ollie is in school\u201d is not living in reality. In all likelihood there will be another excuse in 3 years and then she\u2019ll be that far behind in her own life. She\u2019s not living in reality if she thinks she can be a single SAH mom.", "Nta\n\nShe wanted to play adult and have a kid, now she needs to have the other side of that and act like an adult.

YOU'RE supposed to foot the bill while this happens? Rent, utilities, food for two, diapers, her phone, insurance, even the couch she sits on all day was paid for someone else.

She needs a job, or at least to get an education so she can get a good job and take care of HER child.", "Absolutely NTA \n\nShe doesn't get to \"be just a mom\" on someone else's dime. It's of course hard but she's not married or has a partner to be able to live that scenario. \n\nYou're her mom, not her spouse. Her child and finances are her own responsibility. She's an adult now who is accountable to her own decisions. Paying for her to continue this lifestyle would not be \"helping\" her but enabling.", "NTA. Maybe she's not ready for full-time college or job, but she can certainly do something part-time to grow herself or financial contributions. Being stagnant should not be an encouraged goal. You're doing the right thing for your daughter(s) and grandchild.", "NTA- part of \u201cbeing a mom\u201d is providing for the child. She clearly has support from you, the baby\u2019s father, and his family. I realize she is only 18 and wants to have a life as a young adult; but Ollie means that is no longer an option.", "NTA\n\nWas none of this discussed when she was deciding whether to keep the child? I think it should have been stressed. She doesn't seem to feel any pressing need to do her fair share to financially support the child. \n\nAlso, you are being very generous, too generous in my opinion. The nights out with her little sister watching the kid? Those need to stop. Her sister didn't ruin her adolescence with an unplanned pregnancy, and does not deserve to have any hand in caring for the child unless she is being paid or wants to help. In that area, I think you are being a bit of an asshole. Help Jade out by telling her she is under no obligation to babysit. And say it in front of April. She needs a wake-up call. Make her find and/or pay a sitter (and not you!) if she wants to party.\n\nSet a deadline for her to get work or get into school. If she passes the deadline, you need to explain that new living arrangements are going to be required. She's going to need to find a place to live and ask the father for more assistance. That alone would wake her up from her delusion she is a SAHM.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ta. By 2, it\u2019s ok to start working again I think. If Ollie is with the dad on the weekends then she could at least work weekends. Yeah she\u2019ll never really have a break but that\u2019s what being a parent is. No breaks.

She has a freaking kid, she needed to be a grown up like yesterday.", "NTA-look for parent support groups to help you navigate these waters.

He's never been in the picture for either of our girls after that.\n\nWhen April was 16, she unexpectedly got pregnant. I took her to counselling to help her organise her thoughts and figure out what she wanted to do, and April decided she wanted to keep the baby.\n\nThe pregnancy and birth went smoothly and I now have a grandson Ollie [m2]. The father is involved but he and April are no longer together. Ollie stays with his dad every weekend, and the dad's parents give April money to go towards Ollie's expenses.\n\nEarlier this year, April graduated high school. She's been taking care of Ollie during the week but other than that she hasn't been up to much. She keeps saying she'll start looking for a job but hasn't even started writing her resume.\n\nBesides taking care of Ollie, she just sits at home watching TV. On multiple occasions, April has tried to leave Ollie with Jade so that she can go out partying which has to lead to huge arguments.\n\nLast week, I talked to April and I told her that she needs to get a job or go to our local community college, and that I'll foot the bill for any childcare she needs for it to happen. I told her she needs to get a job or go to college in order to stay here.\n\nApril got upset and said that she doesn't want a job or to go to college, she said she just wants to be a mom. She told me it can wait until Ollie starts school. I told her no and that she needs to start something so that she can support herself and be an independent adult.\n\nApril said I'm being unreasonable and that these things can wait until Ollie is in school full-time. She said that I'm asking her to \"damage\" him and that he needs his mom.\n\nIt's not that I don't want April and Ollie here, I love them both, I just think I'd be setting a bad precedent by allowing April to continue to stay with me with no job and no education in the making.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You did not sign on to support her after she was 18 and never signed on to financially support her and your grandchild after she turned 18.  Nor did you tell her she could live there for free forever.

That means finding a way to support the two of them on their own out of your house.

April is going to have to get a job eventually, especially since you won\u2019t always be around. If this situation continues as it is you very much could end up in the same position as my sister. \nSister lives in a small 3 bedroom apartment with both her sons (30s), the partner of the youngest son (not married), and their 3 kids (5, 2, 3months). Oldest son is living there until he saves up enough to get his own place (just left an abusive relationship), so this story only focuses on her youngest son and his kids. \nYS partner has a job. YS had a job but keeps on quitting or getting fired because he thinks he knows better than anyone else about the job. They are supposed to help pay for the rent and groceries, but because YS keeps on quitting his jobs they can\u2019t pay as much as they should. This makes it so my sister has to pay more in order to afford not only living in the apartment, but also more in groceries. Then YS is almost always playing video games and the needs of the kids falls onto my sister who is up around 3am until she gets off of work in the evening around 6:30pm.

You only get to be a SAHM if someone is willing to provide for you financially, and apparently April wants that support to come from you. Ha! Not how the world works. Mom or not, she is an able-bodied adult and the expectation is that able-bodied adults work, or study to get better work. Your adult daughter seems to want to sit on her ass all day with no direction and it\u2019s up to you to keep that from happening, since it\u2019s your couch upon which she sits.  \n\nYour offer to cover childcare is very generous, and pretty great considering lack of affordable childcare is a major problem that keeps so many single mothers in poverty.
