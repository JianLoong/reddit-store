He's never been in the picture for either of our girls after that.\n\nWhen April was 16, she unexpectedly got pregnant. I took her to counselling to help her organise her thoughts and figure out what she wanted to do, and April decided she wanted to keep the baby.\n\nThe pregnancy and birth went smoothly and I now have a grandson Ollie [m2]. The father is involved but he and April are no longer together. Ollie stays with his dad every weekend, and the dad's parents give April money to go towards Ollie's expenses.\n\nEarlier this year, April graduated high school. She's been taking care of Ollie during the week but other than that she hasn't been up to much. She keeps saying she'll start looking for a job but hasn't even started writing her resume.\n\nBesides taking care of Ollie, she just sits at home watching TV. On multiple occasions, April has tried to leave Ollie with Jade so that she can go out partying which has to lead to huge arguments.\n\nLast week, I talked to April and I told her that she needs to get a job or go to our local community college, and that I'll foot the bill for any childcare she needs for it to happen. I told her she needs to get a job or go to college in order to stay here.\n\nApril got upset and said that she doesn't want a job or to go to college, she said she just wants to be a mom. She told me it can wait until Ollie starts school. I told her no and that she needs to start something so that she can support herself and be an independent adult.\n\nApril said I'm being unreasonable and that these things can wait until Ollie is in school full-time. She said that I'm asking her to \"damage\" him and that he needs his mom.\n\nIt's not that I don't want April and Ollie here, I love them both, I just think I'd be setting a bad precedent by allowing April to continue to stay with me with no job and no education in the making.", "created_utc": 1670951916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl14fe/aita_for_telling_my_18_yo_daughter_she_needs_to/", "score": 1080, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter had a baby and needs to understand - FULL STOP - that she doesn't just get to be a mom. She's single and living at home with her own mother.   She's being unreasonable, selfish and lazy to expect you to support her while she lazes around unemployed until her child gets to school age.", "NTA. She chose to have this baby, so she should be providing for him. That's, like, bare minimum when it comes to being a parent.", "NTA. She doesn't get to just sit around doing nothing on your dime. You are absolutely right. It's time for her to grow up and honestly you're making it super easy on her by offering to pay for child care, because even that isn't real life. You are doing the right thing. Stick to your guns.", "NTA- April needs to work to support herself and she's just wasting time that could be used either to work herself up in a job or to get educated. \n\nI would tell her, sure, I'd love to sit around and watch TV all day too, but it's a good thing for you I don't. Let me be clear- I'm not asking. You aren't unique. Single moms everywhere go to work to support their kids. Ollie will be just fine. Also, since you're acting like a child, I'm banning you from the TV. Also, Jade will be paid to babysit. If you can't afford her, then don't ask her. You need to own up to your responsibilities.", "Your daughter wants to have her cake, and eat it too. \n\nYou asking her to work and contribute to the household is not unreasonable. I'm sure her exes custody funds some of your grandchild's needs, but not all. Which is where your daughter has to come in and provide the rest. \n\nNTA", "NTA She's getting to the point where she's now tryna ditch the kid to go and party it up. BS, she needs to get her sh!t together and stop acting like an immature brat. Plus being a SAHM requires being married to partner who can afford it and leaving a kid behind with her minor sister to drink and drug it up and possibly wind up pregnant again is more damaging to a toddler than going to daycare while she prioritizes bettering her life for the both of them.", "NTA\u2026 unfortunately being a SAHM is a privilege that only some people can afford. She clearly cannot. \nI think the only way you\u2019re going to be able to get through to her is to \u201ckick her out\u201d. I don\u2019t know what country you\u2019re in so not sure whether council housing is an option. \nShe is taking advantage of you because you\u2019re her mum and she expects you to care for her forever.", "NTA. Your daughter needs to take responsibility for her actions. Either get a job or go to school. Those are basic rules for adult children living at home, add the extra child, and this seems like an IMMEDIATE REQUIREMENT. You are not responsible for continuing to be solely responsible for the financial care for your adult child and her child. She isn't being fair to you, she is taking advantage.", "NTA. She doesn't get to be a SAHM while you foot all the bills. She needs a reality check. She wanted to be a mom? Cool, she needs to be a responsible adult and provide for herself and child.", "NTA. April needs to support her and Ollie and having a job or going to college is doing that. Right now she\u2019s using her son as an excuse to not do anything.", "NTA. Your kid made a decision to have sex and it ended in a pregnancy, you were nice enough to help her out while she was still in high school, but she is now 18, and an adult. She needs to suck it up and get a job or go to school. Being a single stay at home mom isn\u2019t a thing, she needs to get her priorities straight.", "NTA. She's an adult. Your requests are perfectly reasonable. Most community colleges offer online classes, maybe she can start with a couple of those.", "NTA, your daughter has a 2 year old child yet acts like one herself. Teen pregnancy makes me so sad", "NTA, stand firm, she's a mom, she's old enough to learn she needs to support her baby", "NTA\n\nYoung single parents do not get the luxury of being a SAHP. \n\nMany community colleges have childcare available for students. She should look into that.", "NTA. You're being amazing by offering to pay her childcare while she gets back on her feet.

If she just sits around doing nothing for another few years, she is just falling farther and farther behind, and if she loses the financial support she is getting, she will have nothing to fall back on.  \n\nIt seems pretty reasonable for her to start work or school, maybe just part time for now, but then she will at least be making some progress towards independence.  A lot of schools offer online classes now, so maybe that would work as a place to start. \n\nSeems like she needs some tough love.", "NTA\n\nIt's nice of you to pay for childcare. You could kick her out and then she'd really need to get a job, so you're doing a good job as a parent by both supporting her and giving her a gentle push out the nest.", "NTA\n\nIf she can go out partying with friends, she can get a job or go to college. It's not remotely fair for your younger daughter, or you, to be her babysitter so she can party.\n\nIf she wanted to party, she never should have had a baby.\n\nIt sounds like she really wanted to be a SAHM. But that's not possible, so it's very reasonable to insist she do one of those things to continue living with you.\n\nShe should be very thankful you're not charging her some rent.", "NTA at all. OP, actually you would be TA if you let daughter do what she wants until her son goes to school. Be firm and do not enable her irresponsibility.", "NTA. She doesn't get to be just a mom, that's not how it works.", "She needs to start setting the right examples for Ollie... Work habits and work ethic take years to develop...and by being a stay at home potato she is the one damaging him.", "NTA\n\nYour child needs to start the path to being able to be an independent single mother.   Hopefully she never has to be without her support network, but it could happen and she needs to have her act together so she can deal with it if it does.", "NTA\n\nOllie is old enough to spend time with other children in a care setting now.  Your requirement that she either get a job or go to school is VERY reasonable.    \nApril made a child.  She is an adult.  She is responsible for caring for, including PAYING for, her child.  Your offer to assist with child care while she either works or goes to school is more than many parents offer.", "NTA but give her a clear deadline so she knows you're serious. Don't let her steamroll you otherwise you'll be taking care of her forever.", "NTA. You want her to take initiative and create a life that\u2019s good for her and her son. You took care of her through her pregnancy and the rest of high school as her mother, and it\u2019s time for her to get out there and work. My friend had a baby at 15, and she busted her ass, with family support too, and became a lawyer to be able to support her child and herself. Not everyone has to push to become a lawyer, but it\u2019s time. It\u2019s time for your daughter to make a life for herself, even if it is hard, and even if it is scary.", "NTA. Tell her that staying at home is for married women with wealthy husbands only. There is no other scenario where this type of family model is realistic or acceptable", "She is lucky to have you helping with childcare.  NTA.", "NTA. She decided to be a teen mom so she needs to take full responsibility of him. She can\u2019t be a sahm because her and her son are not your responsibility. Getting a job or going to school are her best options unless she goes and lives with the father together or not.", "NTA \n\n**There is a massive difference between supporting someone and enabling their selfishness!** \n\nYou are offering to pay for childcare while she goes to school, that is already above and beyond supportive. She needs to get a grip.", "NTA. \n\nShe expects other people to fully support her for the next 3 years? She definitely needs a wake up call, and Ollie needs a mom who lives in the real world, not the fantasy one where she gets to sit around while everyone else supports her. \n\nShe can absolutely get a weekend job for when Ollie is with his Dad. You were very generous to offer to pay for child care so she could get a job or go to school as well. \n\nAnd you are doing a disservice to her by letting her sit around all day and not be building any future, skills, or just an understanding of what it means to be an adult. \n\nTell her she needs to get a job for when Ollie isn't with her, end of story. And stop paying for any non essentials if she refuses. She needs to see actual consequences, because she is clearly living in a fantasy world.", "NTA, you're offering her a great deal. Childcare paid for so she can go to school.", "Ollie needs a lot. One of the things  he needs is a functional adult as a mom. Yes, school or job, staying  mentally 16 is not going  to be a good plan.", "NTA. She made the grownup choice to be a mom and now needs to make the grownup choice to get herself to the point where she can support the child she has.  She gave up the right to stay at home doing nothing when she had that baby.  You've been more than generous to allow her and your grandson to stay in your home rent-free and to provide for childcare while she works or educates herself.  I'd put a finite time limit on when you expect the job or school to start and stick to my guns.  April needs to grow up in a big way.", "NTA. It seems like she\u2019s using Ollie as an excuse. But if she can go out partying and hang out with her friends, she can get a job or go to school.\n\nIf she really is that concerned with leaving him alone, maybe you can compromise and she can get a job/go to school part time.\n\nShe\u2019s very lucky because it seems like you\u2019re a good grandson to him. She has free child care, no bills, she has it made", "NTA - Obviously it\u2019s hard been a teen mom, but that\u2019s what she chose. The deck is stacked against her. Her chances of academic or professional success are statistically very low, but they\u2019re zero if she doesn\u2019t even try. No I don\u2019t blame you at all for wanting her to try to beat the odds. She\u2019d also probably be a lot better off going to college than getting a part time minimum wage job \u2014 assuming you think she\u2019ll be able to finish her degree.", "NTA.  April has chosen a tough road in life, and absolutely needs skills and education to provide for herself and her son.  You are correct to require her to progress in her life.", "NTA. She made adult decisions about sex and raising a kid. She needs to continue to make adult decisions about how she's going to provide for her kid in the long term. To be blunt, you are not going to be around forever plus you have Jade to raise. \n\nThe choices you gave her are good, positive choices, and you offered to pay for child care. Ollie interacting with kids early in life is not going to damage him, it will help him develop socialization skills.", "NTA - While she has a lot going on for a teenager, there is no free lunch.  She needs to provide for her child for the next 16 years at minimum.  That means getting an education or skilled profession now.  \n\nYes it is a lot of adulting and  seems a stark contrast to her same age peers.  But that's reality.  She could still get a job that works weekends, when the dad has the child, and three weekdays which still gives her two days off with the kid.  Or she can do college but only take classes on certain days.  \n\nI agree that with this child being a toddler she doesn't get to be a NEET.  She's asking for a luxury most older parents in most nations don't have.", "NTA\n\nBeing a SAHM isn't just \"being at home watching TV all day\" or \"all the free time in the world to play\". It is also taking care of the house while being a mom. A lot of that invisible labor in the form of domestic chores and parenting that people generally don't think about when they think about work. April isn't a SAHM, she's a leech who doesn't take care of her kid and tries to act like a carefree teenager", "NTA, April is being highly irresponsible: she needs to be able to support her son, and not expect to live off others for free. By not undertaking paid employment or attending community college, she is teaching her son that having a lack of work ethic is acceptable. The irony of her saying she wants to be a mom is that she contradicts herself when she exploits her sister to baby sit, so that she can party. I use the word \"exploit\" because she is taking advantage of her young sister to be frivolous and forget her responsibility.\n\nYou'll have to give her an ultimatum either she gets a job, even just part time, go to community college (which you've said you'll fund), or she finds somewhere else to live. Tell your daughter if she can't take adult responsibilities, she shouldn't make adult decisions such as have unprotected sex, etc. Yes it is harsh but she is shying away from her responsibilities and taking advantage of yours and her sister's good nature.", "NTA\n\nA SAHM isnt dependant upon her own Mom to foot the bill of her and her childs necessities, especially when the father is paying child support.\n\nIf she wants to be a SAHM, then she can move into her own place and pay her own utilities and food etc. And then maybe she will understand that what you are providing for her is very generous. \n\nYou are being more than reasonable, and in fact in offering to pay daycare so she can go to school or get a job, you are being very generous!\n\nI agree with you, she needs to do something other than take care of a 2 year old and watch TV all day.", "NTA.\n\nThe current status of her life does not allow April to be a stay-at-home mom. You are being more then generous in offering to help pay for her childcare, and it's very bold of her to say she just wants to be a mom when she's trying to foist Ollie off on her little sister. It sounds like what April really wants is to be a typical teenager with 0 responsibility. I don't blame her for that, but its' frankly not the reality she lives in.\n\nIt sounds like you are doing your best to be a good mom, and keep sticking to your guns on April getting some kind of job or education.", "NTA\n\nI never finished high school because I had a child at 16 and had to get a job. She is lucky that she was able to graduate.\n\nShe is 18 now. She is technically an adult, so yes she needs a job or college. Otherwise, she is going to stay with you forever.\n\nStand firm. This was her choice and now she needs to learn how to be a parent and an adult.", "NTA and there\u2019s PLENTY of online schools that are accredited she can go to.", "NTA\n\nYou're offering a lot of help and support, both financial and emotional. You're trying to help April in the long term.  She could also find a PT weekend job in the meantime.", "NTA. She is acting very childish, that's because she's still a kid - that has a kid.", "NTA. If she wants to be a SAHM then she needs to find a wealthy-enough partner who consents to that decision. If she is dependent on you for her livelihood, then she can follow your guidelines.\n\nOut of curiosity: Is there a compromise? Would you accept her working part-time and working her way up to a full-time job? Is the expectation that she financially contribute to the household or you're just trying, as a mother, to get her off the couch for her own good?", "NTA, she needs to work on supporting herself.", "NTA. Stand your ground!", "NTA\n\n>Last week, I talked to April and I told her that she needs to get a job or go to our local community college, and that I'll foot the bill for any childcare she needs for it to happen.\n\nApril clearly doesn't realise just how generous an offer this is. Childcare costs are absolutely *astronomical* and she certainly wouldn't be able to afford it on her own. What you're proposing will help her hugely in bettering herself without ending up in financial difficulties, which is a prospect a lot of teenage mothers without financial support face.\n\nSo yeah, she made the decision to have her child, now she has to take the necessary steps to provide for him as the adult she is.", "NTA, put your foot down abs don\u2019t cave. You let her finish school which was important plus she was still a legally dependent minor herself. Unfortunately she still have the mentality of a minor. She\u2019s only 18 so, that\u2019s to be expected, not accepted. When she\u2019s saying \u201cit can wait\u201d what she means is mom, keep working abs eating Money to subsidize me until I feel ready to work. Which will be never.", "NTA. That\u2019s just not how life works. April made the grown up decision to have a child, now she must deal with the grown up consequences of that decision. And at any rate now that Olllie is 2, daycare will be good for him. He\u2019ll be able to socialize with other children and learn how to behave in a classroom setting before going to school.", "NTA. \n\nI was apprehensive when I started reading the title but it's not an unreasonable request. Community college or job would help her in the long run. You can't keep providing for your daughter and your grandchild forever.", "NTA.  You can't be a stay at home single mom, that just isn't how the world works as much as she'd like to will it to be that way.", "NTA. I had my son at 17. I graduated early, went to college, got a degree and a career. I was never allowed to sit at home, I had to work, I moved out at 18, and took care of myself and my child. \n\nApril is lazy AF. And it will only get worse if she doesn\u2019t get her butt into gear now and do something so she can provide for her child later.", "NTA. \n\nShe's 18. At 18 it's reasonable to expect a child to do work or school if they want to continue living free in the family home. Something showing some type of intent to be able to support themselves eventually. She has extra reason to do that since she has a child relying on her. \n\nYou're offering to cover childcare expenses, and assuming you're offering *decent* childcare and not a scary cheap unlicensed daycare, you're removing the main obstacle most young parents have with working or continuing their education. \n\nSo... yeah. I really don't see how you're an AH here. Ollie isn't your child, you never agreed to support a SAHM situation for his mom/your daughter, so that being what she *wants* isn't really relevent. If that's what she *wants* she has to find someone willing (and able) to support that, which you aren't.", "NTA. She needs to own her choices. No one owes her a free ride. She is owed child support from the father and that is it. \n\nThe longer she is out of the job market w/o going to school, the more her eventual ernings will be \"put back\". The job opportunities for a 21 yr old w/o any schooling or college are pretty limited. Anyone else her age will have work experience or a degree or often both. She is messing up her future and expecting you will always puck up the slac for her. She needs a serious reality check.", "NTA. In order for her to \u201cjust be a mom\u201d, she needs someone to foot the bill. And not just baby\u2019s expenses but full adult bills. She can\u2019t expect you to house and feed her forever. What you are doing is being a parent to her and teaching her how to be a functional adult.", "NTA. It\u2019s not even about setting a bad precedent. This is HER son, not yours. HER responsibility, not yours. The fact that you\u2019re willing to take care of childcare so she can go to college is very generous, and she should absolutely take the offer.", " NTA. I get not every 18 year old is ready for college, but she also has a baby\u2019s future to consider along with her own. CC would be the best option and work towards an associate degree in something she finds interesting. If not she needs to find a job. But not going to school and not having a job \u201cuntil Ollie is in school\u201d is not living in reality. In all likelihood there will be another excuse in 3 years and then she\u2019ll be that far behind in her own life. She\u2019s not living in reality if she thinks she can be a single SAH mom.", "Nta\n\nShe wanted to play adult and have a kid, now she needs to have the other side of that and act like an adult.

YOU'RE supposed to foot the bill while this happens? Rent, utilities, food for two, diapers, her phone, insurance, even the couch she sits on all day was paid for someone else.

She needs a job, or at least to get an education so she can get a good job and take care of HER child.", "Absolutely NTA \n\nShe doesn't get to \"be just a mom\" on someone else's dime. It's of course hard but she's not married or has a partner to be able to live that scenario. \n\nYou're her mom, not her spouse. Her child and finances are her own responsibility. She's an adult now who is accountable to her own decisions. Paying for her to continue this lifestyle would not be \"helping\" her but enabling.", "NTA. Maybe she's not ready for full-time college or job, but she can certainly do something part-time to grow herself or financial contributions. Being stagnant should not be an encouraged goal. You're doing the right thing for your daughter(s) and grandchild.", "NTA- part of \u201cbeing a mom\u201d is providing for the child. She clearly has support from you, the baby\u2019s father, and his family. I realize she is only 18 and wants to have a life as a young adult; but Ollie means that is no longer an option.", "NTA\n\nWas none of this discussed when she was deciding whether to keep the child? I think it should have been stressed. She doesn't seem to feel any pressing need to do her fair share to financially support the child. \n\nAlso, you are being very generous, too generous in my opinion. The nights out with her little sister watching the kid? Those need to stop. Her sister didn't ruin her adolescence with an unplanned pregnancy, and does not deserve to have any hand in caring for the child unless she is being paid or wants to help. In that area, I think you are being a bit of an asshole. Help Jade out by telling her she is under no obligation to babysit. And say it in front of April. She needs a wake-up call. Make her find and/or pay a sitter (and not you!) if she wants to party.\n\nSet a deadline for her to get work or get into school. If she passes the deadline, you need to explain that new living arrangements are going to be required. She's going to need to find a place to live and ask the father for more assistance. That alone would wake her up from her delusion she is a SAHM.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ta. By 2, it\u2019s ok to start working again I think. If Ollie is with the dad on the weekends then she could at least work weekends. Yeah she\u2019ll never really have a break but that\u2019s what being a parent is. No breaks.

She has a freaking kid, she needed to be a grown up like yesterday.", "NTA-look for parent support groups to help you navigate these waters.

He's never been in the picture for either of our girls after that.\n\nWhen April was 16, she unexpectedly got pregnant. I took her to counselling to help her organise her thoughts and figure out what she wanted to do, and April decided she wanted to keep the baby.\n\nThe pregnancy and birth went smoothly and I now have a grandson Ollie [m2]. The father is involved but he and April are no longer together. Ollie stays with his dad every weekend, and the dad's parents give April money to go towards Ollie's expenses.\n\nEarlier this year, April graduated high school. She's been taking care of Ollie during the week but other than that she hasn't been up to much. She keeps saying she'll start looking for a job but hasn't even started writing her resume.\n\nBesides taking care of Ollie, she just sits at home watching TV. On multiple occasions, April has tried to leave Ollie with Jade so that she can go out partying which has to lead to huge arguments.\n\nLast week, I talked to April and I told her that she needs to get a job or go to our local community college, and that I'll foot the bill for any childcare she needs for it to happen. I told her she needs to get a job or go to college in order to stay here.\n\nApril got upset and said that she doesn't want a job or to go to college, she said she just wants to be a mom. She told me it can wait until Ollie starts school. I told her no and that she needs to start something so that she can support herself and be an independent adult.\n\nApril said I'm being unreasonable and that these things can wait until Ollie is in school full-time. She said that I'm asking her to \"damage\" him and that he needs his mom.\n\nIt's not that I don't want April and Ollie here, I love them both, I just think I'd be setting a bad precedent by allowing April to continue to stay with me with no job and no education in the making.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If this situation continues as it is you very much could end up in the same position as my sister. \nSister lives in a small 3 bedroom apartment with both her sons (30s), the partner of the youngest son (not married), and their 3 kids (5, 2, 3months). Oldest son is living there until he saves up enough to get his own place (just left an abusive relationship), so this story only focuses on her youngest son and his kids. \nYS partner has a job. YS had a job but keeps on quitting or getting fired because he thinks he knows better than anyone else about the job. They are supposed to help pay for the rent and groceries, but because YS keeps on quitting his jobs they can\u2019t pay as much as they should. This makes it so my sister has to pay more in order to afford not only living in the apartment, but also more in groceries. Then YS is almost always playing video games and the needs of the kids falls onto my sister who is up around 3am until she gets off of work in the evening around 6:30pm.

You only get to be a SAHM if someone is willing to provide for you financially, and apparently April wants that support to come from you. Ha! Not how the world works.

Your adult daughter seems to want to sit on her ass all day with no direction and it\u2019s up to you to keep that from happening, since it\u2019s your couch upon which she sits.  \n\nYour offer to cover childcare is very generous, and pretty great considering lack of affordable childcare is a major problem that keeps so many single mothers in poverty.

A job or school should help raise her selfesteem as well as making her a better role model and provider for her son. Letting her sit at home is just enabling bad behavior and will make her life more difficult in the long run. What if something happens to you and you can't provide for her? In 5 years, she'll have a better chance getting a job if she's spent her time in school or has a work history - \"I saw every episode of The Young and the Restless\" doesn't look great on a resume.", "Has she thought about working at a daycare? She can earn an income and watch her son at the same time. NTA obviously, she has more of reason than most people her age to be focusing on the future and at the moment she actually has the support and means to do so. I think she will really regret it if she doesn\u2019t take this opportunity. It will only get harder if not.", "NTA \n\nIf April isn't in counselling and regular therapy, she needs to be.\n\nThis is pure conjecture on my part, but to me it seems like she's just trying to reclaim her youth - which she elected to put to the side when she chose to keep her baby.\n\nThe thing is, as you well know, being a mom isn't just being around your kid. It's providing for them, working to keep yourself and them afloat, and working to provide a better life for them.\n\nWhat's her future plan? Live with you forever? That's not gonna fly.\n\nApril being a mom to Ollie means she's responsible for providing for him. She can't count on the other grandparents constantly shelling out to her. What happens when they stop because she's refusing to work? \n\nApril can want what she wants. She chose to have Ollie, and that choice means sacrificing for him. \n\nBeing a mom is hard work and she's gonna need to learn to do it. For her son's sake if not her own.", "NTA.\n\nA friend of mine had a child with a man that she realized was not the kind of man that she wanted to raise a baby with. She made the choice to keep her baby and made steps to ensure that she would be able to provide for herself and her baby even though she was still living at home and getting a lot of support from her parents. She worked part time and was going to trade school to prepare for a career that would allow her to be self reliant.\n\nNow while my friend was older than your daughter, I think that you are very smart to do what you can to make sure that she is prepared for the future. Sit down and talk with her seriously. What does her future look like? What kind of life does she want for her and Ollie in 5, 10, 15 years? What steps does she need to take now for it to be a reality.", "NTA - Your daughter made an adult decision to have sex, now she needs to be an adult and take care of her son which means being able to provide for him. God forbid something happens to you, then what??? What will she do when she can no longer count on you to foot the bill?? Put your foot down now before she gets worse", "NTA. Whatever she thinks being a mom is, she's wrong about it. Because \"just getting to be a mom\" includes things like making sure that you can provide food and shelter for your child without relying on handouts. With her being over 18, you could kick her out and cut her off tomorrow and she'd be absolutely screwed. Not that you're going to do that, but she's just expecting you to be there to bail her out always. If you disappeared she be very high-and-dry. That's not parenting her child. That's mooching off her parent. Parenting is not just playing with your child or teaching them things. It's providing for them. She's not providing for her son at all.", "NTA. You\u2019ve given her a break the last two years to make sure she finished school. It\u2019s time for her to take responsibility for herself and her child. You\u2019re doing more than enough housing them and offering to pay for childcare when she\u2019s at work or school!", "NTA-- figuring out how to pay for a child should have come into play during her therapy to decide whether she wanted the child. I work as a labor delivery nurse, as well as at an abortion clinic, and I can say that many women are unable to keep a child because of the expenses. She was given a gracious opportunity (by you) to be a parent and still a kid, but at 18 she needs to grow up and leave the nest. How can she parent a child if she is still a child? Many women would love to be a SAHM but can't afford to. What makes her special? Just that she has YOU to bail her out?", "NTA\nShe needed to hear the truth", "NTA you have a responsibility as her mom to support her as she becomes independent so she can support herself and her child on her own. That will not happen overnight and it cannot wait for anything. If something happens to you both of them will be worse off for her lack of independence in many ways. She is an adult in more ways than one now and building her future cannot wait.", "This is why teenage pregnancies are so harmful for everyone involved.\nChildren who can't even be expected to be responsible for their own lives and careers are expected to be responsible for another human being.\nOP's daughter doesn't even understand that to be a full-time mom, she needs a stable income source, which is usually provided by a partner who has a job.\nThis child is lucky to have a supportive mother and a coparenting partner with good parents who are all helping her care for the child.\nAnd she is just trying to milk them for more freebies and favors.\nHer mother and the therapist should have made her understand that, the moment she decided to keep the child, her own childhood was over and she needs to step up and be a mature adult. Otherwise just end it, or give the child up for adoption so that he may have a good life with responsible adults who are ready for parenting roles. \n\nNTA OP. Your adult daughter who is a mother herself now, needs to take responsibility and use the support you offer to work towards a better life for herself and her kid.", "Someone teach these kids what a fuckin condom is holy shit.\nNta for this, but yta for not taking sex ed seriously god damn", "NTA. Sit down with April. Tell her the following: we are not guaranteed a tomorrow. I could die in my sleep tonight. Social services would place your sister with either your father or another relative. Social services mught not be too concerned about you or they might decide Ollie needs to be tsken from you until yoyr sitiation stabilizes. There's no guarantee that said relative would also take you and Ollie into their home. I'm pushing you to start being self-supporting so if sonething happened to me or your other support system, you wouldn't be scrambling for housing or getting involved with toxic partners because they pay your way.", "NTA. She should have gotten a job when she was pregnant and should have been working this whole time. To be a SAHM she needs someone willing to fully support her and the child. That is not your job.", "NAH - Nothing wrong with wanting her to get a job but also should have some empathy towards her situation. Who's meant to mind Ollie when she's working?", "Bring mom means being able to financially care for the child. Ollie may need medical attention (hopefully not) braces may want to do extra curricular activities  go to college .. all of that cost money \u2026 so she needs a job", "Totally agreed. April wanted to be a single teen mom, this is what the reality is. \n\nSAHMs are a luxury for people who can afford to do it. They wait to have kids until they\u2019re established, have a stable partner, and can handle raising kids on a single income. It\u2019s not something everyone can do and April made choices to become a mom as a teen without any of these things in place. \n\nGetting a job and supporting yourself while being a single mom are the realities and consequences for her choices. She\u2019s lucky enough she has OP offering childcare and supporting her as is.", "If shit happens, what then? Unfortunate as it may be she needs to haul herself up and ensure a modicum of independence \u2014 starting now while she still has support. \n\nBeing a mom is more than just spending time with the kids. NTA", "And OP needs to tell her April that Jade is not her free babysitter...EVER. If April wants to go out and Jade AGREES to babysit, April needs to pay her. But since April doesn't want to do ANYTHING but be a mom, then she doesn't get to go out with friends and party.", "Facts", "NTA.\nWhen you choose to have a child, you have to make sacrifices. It's called growing up. \n\nMy God Son came into this world when I was 17, a month before I was 18.\n\nMy friend was in the middle of preparing for college and living her life still at home with her parents.\n\nThose 9 months leading up was spent making as much money as possible, getting clothing, formula, etc. As set up as possible.\n\nHe's now 3, she worked multiple jobs at a time and now she's overnight so she can spend time with him while he's awake and he gets to snuggle w grandma the nights she works.\n\nIf it really is important to OPs daughter, she'd make it work. It's no longer about what she wants to do, it's about the best action to take to better her future so she can provide.\n\nOP has already been taking care of both, only asking to start working on her daughters future. Not even to start paying for things, that sounds like a dream where she can buy what she wants and save the rest. Or, spend a couple hours with people her age at college then come back home. \n\nI really think OPs daughter just wants the free ride for as long as possible. \n\nIf OP waits until the kid starts school it's gonna be, \"Well I didn't get an education so i can't work, can you pay for it?\" Then be on OPs pocket book for however many more years.", "> Ollie stays with his dad every weekend\n\nI mean, she literally could get a part-time job on weekends and not even have to worry about childcare. OP is extremely generous by offering to cover any childcare expenses. \n\nOP - You are doing the right thing. Mom or not, a post-high school child should either be working or in school. Period.", "> because even that isn't real life \n\nI'm tired of people using \"real life\" to mean someone got an advantage some don't. Both realities are equally valid, and OP coming along side and helping her daughter instead of turning her out into the streets is just as \"real life\" as a single mother scraping to get by \n\nby implying its some sort of fantasy you make it sound like OP SHOULD be abandoning her daughter to the cruel world. which is absolutely not the case.

Great idea", "Except she isn't by herself and her life isn't ruined, largely because OP has been a good parent to her.\nShe has graduated highschool, and she has the ability (Through OP's help!) to get a job and go to college. Yes it may be more difficult because she has a baby, but her life is not ruined and she complete potential to do anything as long as OP encourages and supports her.\nIf you factor out the baby right now, her situation isn't any different then a fresh highschool graduate who doesn't want to go to college or get a job. She wants to be lazy, and OP is doing a remarkable job in encouraging her to get a job or go to college like any parent would their 18 year old.\nThis girl's life is not ruined; the baby's life is not ruined. She just has typical young adult laziness, that I myself have experienced before, and OP is seeking to fix and can fix."]}
