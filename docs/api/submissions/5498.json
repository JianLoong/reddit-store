We are in our early 30's and have been trying for a child for some time - due to character limits I won't get into details, but it has been difficult.\n\nIn February, we discovered that she was pregnant! Obviously, we were over the moon with joy. We began to prepare - we did everything you could possibly do to get ready. We planned a baby shower and sent out invitations, we prepared a beautiful room with a custom-made crib by my father in law (who is a very talented woodworker), and we were extremely thorough in baby-proofing our home.\n\nDuring the baby-proofing, my wife started to suggest that we \"get rid of\" my cat, Bubba, who is 12 years old and I've had since he was a kitten. I got him in college, I adopted him and each of my two sisters adopted another kitten from the same litter. Bubba is extremely affectionate to me - so sweet and cuddly. He tolerates my wife, but is not affectionate towards her. To strangers, he is not nice. He has never bitten or scratched anyone, but he does a lot of hissing and yowling at people he is unfamiliar with. My wife was afraid that he'd scare the baby, he wouldn't be welcoming to a newborn, or that he'd hurt her. I argued gently, but eventually acquiesced. In her 28th week of pregnancy, we sent him to live with my parents.\n\nHe was not happy there. My parents said he cried all day and walked around meowing 24 hours a day, looking for me.\n\nTragically, my wife and I lost our child just weeks before she was due. We still don't have a lot of answers, and it's painful to get into. \n\nWe mourned. We were inconsolable for weeks. I still cannot think about it without feeling complete agony and loss.  After a month, we returned to some level of normalcy - as normal as things could be, anyway. We've started to explore adoption.\n\nLast week, I told my wife I was going to pick up Bubba to bring him back home.\n\nShe *exploded*. She said that under no circumstances would she allow him back in our house, and that I had agreed to have him live with my parents. I missed him. He's been my best friend for years, he's been my loyal companion my entire adult life. She told me that I could pretty much choose between her or Bubba. I told her that *obviously* I would choose her, it's not even a question, but that I didn't understand her reasoning and I felt she was being cruel. She'd lived with Bubba for 10 years, and there had never been any problem. The adoption process can take eight to twelve months on average, and I'd like to spend that time having Bubba around.\n\nWe haven't spoken about it since. This is the first fight we've had. Am I being unreasonable/the asshole in wanting my cat back?", "created_utc": 1671849620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztzoc7/aita_for_wanting_to_bring_my_cat_back_into_my/", "score": 18055, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My sister who recently had a baby has a cat who also hisses at strangers but is cuddly with his owners. Honestly, he can't even tell that her baby is a human at all and only ever sniffs her or avoids her. On top of that, a child will not be afraid of a cat unless they are raised to be or are HORRIBLY hurt. A tiny scratch will not traumatize a baby.", "NTA. And you shouldn't had get rid of the cat in the first place.", "[removed]", "Info: do you think she sees this as you giving up on your ability to have kids, a thing she wasn\u2019t ready for?

This is not about Bubba.\n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong, OP. Given the context of first fight in 10 years (ie\u2026clearly you\u2019re not communicating with each other, and now something painful has happened and you\u2019re fighting \u201cabout Bubba\u201d).\n\nNAH", "NTA.

Counseling is a must. Take it from one grieving parent to another, counseling over reddit.\n\nDo not show her this thread to prove a point. and I mean that from a place of love.\n\nFrom a grieving Mom who was illogical and hard to deal with.", "NAH for wanting to bring the cat back - he has been your feline friend so of course you\u2019d like him around.

I am really really sorry for your loss. \u2764\ufe0f", "NAH. Normally, I\u2019d be all up in arms about you having to give up your cat. I have a fifteen-year-old cat who is literally my favorite thing in the world, and I\u2019d willingly choose her over 99.9% of all human beings on the planet. I really, really feel for you. But your wife is not only grieving the loss of a child but also her ability to physically give birth to her own children. I have no children, but I can imagine how awful she feels. To her, bringing the cat back represents giving up on having a baby, but having your cat back would probably really help you with your grief. Meanwhile, Bubba\u2019s also grieving the loss of his favorite person! It stinks that there\u2019s no neat way to resolve this. Are y\u2019all seeing a counselor or anything? These might be issues y\u2019all could better resolve with a third party. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sorry for all the loss y\u2019all have been experiencing lately and really hope you guys can find peace.", "NTA. But also I\u2019d like to say that adopting a replacement for the child you are mourning is awful too. Im that adopted child and it\u2019s shitty.", "NAH Your wife is afraid that you secretly think that you two will never have children. In her mind, you would not bring your cat back home only to rehome him in a couple of months.", "I think it would be best to try therapy before anything else. Your wife just lost the baby she was growing for 9 months and that certainly takes a toll on someone.", "Buddy. Get the damn cat back why in the hell did you Even get rid of it in the first place. \n\nAs a woman who's gone through a miscarriage I get it but her anger is misplaced and she needs therapy and healing. Not to screamed ultimatum and take away from you.", "There's a lot of under the surface emotional stuff that you and your wife are going through here.\n\nI'm 95% certain that your wife isn't mad at the cat, but is probably feeling many things about what the cat means. \n\nRecommending counseling for you and her or both if not already being done. \n\nNAH", "Nta. This is a bizarre response and I hate to minimize it to stress your wife is under from the loss but thats most likely what it is (not that it isnt stressful and painful for you as well it absolutely is).\n\nIt isnt fair that you had to give away a more senior aged kitten. I wouldn't go so far as to suggest bringing Bubba back against her wishes but I say set a hard limit that you will bring him back?\n\nLike \"ok hon one more month of him at my folks then he is coming home\".\n\nShe can't come up with a good reason not to have him back and he would make you feel better? If she resents that its kind of selfish honestly.\n\nNta", "NAH\n\nYou miss your cat and want it back. For you, that sits on its own.\n\nYour wife is dealing with the loss of the child that was inside of her, the knowledge that it\u2019s her body that is preventing that happening again (and I can tell you that, no matter how strong everyone is on the \u2018it\u2019s not your fault\u2019 message, that blame gets internalised anyway), and an uncertain future facing adoption. For her, the return of the cat is linked and could be taken as you giving up on any future child (especially since, presumably, you\u2019d have to get rid of it again if you did in fact adopt).\n\nI think emotions are running high here and you need to talk through them. Do consider though if this is best for the cat in the long run if you\u2019re just going to return it to your parents\u2019 house at a future date if adoption is successful.\n\nGood luck.", "She\u2019s probably jealous and this has hit a nerve.

I\u2019d suggest seeking a second opinion with ob on that especially if it\u2019s bicornuate or unicornate.", "NAH. It hasn't been very long since your agonizing loss and you are both in a really delicate place right now. Yelling at you like that was definitely an overreaction, but it sounds like there might be more going on here- like maybe she feels taking back the cat means you're giving up on having a baby or something. This deserves a calm conversation with a couples counselor, not an ultimatum.", "NTA. TBH I would t have let the cat leave to start w", "NTA. I have 2 cats I've had for 6 yrs now. One of them hates pretty much anyone who doesn't live in the house. Admittedly she can be aggressive but she is very sweet to us. My mom mentioned I should get rid of her before I had my baby. That was a year ago. The cat doesn't care about the baby at all. She comes over sniffs him sometimes and walks away. You never know how animals will react but you can give them a chance.", "NTA.  Everyone grieves differently and having your cat back will be good for you.  Getting your car back isn\u2019t symbolic of never having a baby.  They aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.  Good luck", "NTA for wanting your cat back, but your wife probably feels on some level like you've given up on having kids if you're taking back a cat you rehomed for the safety of an anticipated child. You are un-baby-proofing the house. You are returning to, and embracing, a normal in which you two are not parents and are not going to be parents in the near future. She's probably still grieving heavily for your miscarried child, and I'd imagine she's really sensitive to feeling like your lost kid is being erased. \n\nShe also knows that when you guys adopt or foster or get pregnant again, she'll probably have to fight you all over again to get rid of your cat that she's probably always resented.\n\nI don't think this makes you the asshole for wanting to have your cat back (and the reason I'm going with NTA instead of N A H is because I think her demanding to dump the cat in the first place was an AH move - it's pretty shitty to suddenly dump a senior pet (or any pet) because of a new kid or pet), but consider that for her, it's probably not really about the cat himself so much as what he represents to her - a time in your lives together when you are not parents.", "Nah. Don\u2019t bring the cat home. I\u2019m afraid the cat will turn up missing one day. If you do bring the cat back then you better make it known that if cat turns up missing she is out!", "NTA but your wife is. You are Bubba's person. I don't even like cats but my heart hurts for this poor guy.", "NTA you shouldnt of gotten rid of the cat in the first place", "The cat was always honest w/it\u2019s indifference toward the wife but the wife hid hers. Trust the cat.", "NTA. Your wife was unreasonable to tell you to send him to live with your parents in the first place. Honestly I think it's crazy that you did this after a full decade of all living together. Unless he's previously shown aggression towards children there's also no reason to believe he would harm a baby anyway. Also...the adoption process could take 8-12 MONTHS? Where the hell do you live? In most places infant adoption is more likely to take 8-12 years, well beyond the average lifespan of a cat.", "NTA.\n\nCat Behavior Specialists recommend that a cat gets used to the baby's surroundings before it comes to exist, then you slowly introduce them by using smell, and sound before introducing them with touch and eyesight. Bubba would've likely warmed up to your baby had your baby not been stillbirth.\n\nIt honestly sounds like your wife wanted to look for an excuse to get rid of Bubba and found it with your baby, since you want the cat back she's showing you her true colors. There's evidence to suggest that pets are good therapeutic animals especially with going through loss so Bubba would be a great therapeutic pet for you as you get through this terrible time in your life.\n\nI have a 3 year old cat named Prince and if my girlfriend or wife made me choose between him and her then she should better start packing her bags because she's out the door, I don't care if it's petty.", "Hey! so I'd like to draw attention to something:\n\n>She exploded. She said that under no circumstances would she allow him back in our house, and that I had agreed to have him live with my parents. I missed him. He's been my best friend for years, he's been my loyal companion my entire adult life. She told me that I could pretty much choose between her or Bubba.\n\nShe's always hated the cat, dude. she just finally found a way to get rid of him. wich is just gross.\n\nIf I were in this position I'd let her know I didn't want to adopt a baby until the cat passes. or ya know, just choose the cat. \n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d choose the cat", "NTA you love the cat, he's family, it's not fair that you have to keep hurting without him \\[or him without you\\] esp if you don't have a reason to not bring him home.", "NTA but definitely choose the cat over the wife", "Nta, she is being cruel :/ I am sorry for your loss. Your cat matters though and he misses you, and I\u2019m sure it would be a comfort to you also to have him around :( honestly, I don\u2019t think you needed to take him to your parents house in the first place. Lots of \u201cone person cats\u201d live in houses with babies. There probably aren\u2019t many cats in existence that are particularly \u201cwelcoming\u201d to an infant or a toddler- who are loud and don\u2019t understand cat boundaries. Cats tolerate, it\u2019s what they do.", "nta but you do kind of suck for getting rid of him in the first place.", "NAH. I think the fact that your wife, and you as well, are both still grieving the loss of your child needs to really frame this conversation. Grief does funny things to you and grief over the loss of your child doesn't go away after a matter of weeks. It actually doesn't ever really go away, according to the bereavement specialist I saw after a miscarriage earlier this year, you just sort of grow around it and learn to live with it.\n\nI understand your desire for comfort and familiarity in your grief, and for wanting your much loved pet back in your day to day life. \n\nBut I suspect your wife has been badly triggered by it because \"getting rid of the cat\" was part of baby proofing, and bringing the cat back has a finality (and/or guilt) to it that she can't cope with at the moment - it means her baby you both baby-proofed for isn't ever going to come home to live in the house with you. \n\nThe cat can't substitute for your lost child sadly. Not even another baby - biological or adopted - will replace her baby. Probably the most concerning part of this whole situation for me is that you lost your baby in October, and you are already jumping head first into the adoption process. You both really need time to process your grief first.\n\nI hope for your sake and the cat's sake your wife comes around to the idea of having Bubba back in the house, but in the meantime from personal experience I highly recommend grief counselling.", "Oh OP. Hugs. So many hugs, I am so sorry for your loss. NTA!! \n\nI understand her fear and I understand why you agreed to this. If I may say; one month is not at all a long time. I just lost my partner six months ago, in literal front of me, to cancer and I am just now feeling I might be an actual human. You both have SO far to go, separate and together. \n\nNot my business but maybe pause on that adoption right now, to allow yourself time and space to process the trauma, the loss and to find where you are as a couple once everything isn\u2019t so dark every moment. \n\nIf I had to guess I would say Bubba is a physical reminder that the baby isn\u2019t here. I am guessing she doesn\u2019t know how to say that and might not even recognize it.  She\u2019s not angry at Bubba or you; she\u2019s angry her child is not with her. She might feel like you\u2019re lessening the loss by wanting to so quickly go back to a life with a cat, maybe she feels you\u2019re moving on too quickly. I would suspect it\u2019s a lot of these things on top of the loss of your beautiful child. \n\nIf you\u2019ve always had a great relationship until now, don\u2019t pick the cat. Send it with mom for a bit longer; it\u2019s hard I know but your wife is in a hell that many don\u2019t come out of. She\u2019s your focus RN", "I think you've screwed yourself over. I don't think you should have given him up in the first place, I think you should have been very wary with him around a child like you should be with any pet but not given him up. Now that you have, if you bring him home and then adopt a child and turf the poor cat out again it will be even more stressful for him. I could understand that she may think that if the cat comes back in to the house then maybe you'll just stop wanting a child all together. She hasn't behaved the right way about any of this, from jumping the gun and making demands and blowing up at you but she's grieving. I think you need to sit down and talk about this properly and explain where you're both coming from but also try and understand the others point of view.", "YTA for getting rid of the cat in the first place.", "NTA if she can\u2019t tolerate the cat, she isn\u2019t fit to have a kid. Kick her to the curb and bring that good Kitty home!", "NTA, ditch the wife and get your cat back!", "NTA But on a completely different note: don\u2019t adopt or even consider adoption until you both have completely worked through your grief and she has worked through her grief at not being able to have children. Adopted kids are not a substitute for bio kids, but are way too often seen as such.\nOnto the cat issue: you need to have a discussion without fighting or yelling about why she is so against having the cat back.", "I'm actually on your wife's side. If I was in the situation, returning with the cat would make me feel even more defeated. It would be a physical, daily reminder of the missing piece. The both of you just lost a baby. You want comfort from your animal which I understand. Your wife does not have the same relationship with Bubba. Who will comfort her? Not to mention restrict possibilities regarding adoption, and having to make new arrangements with your parents when the time comes to send him back (assuming you agree to do so).\n\nBubba has already had several months to adapt to his new surroundings with your parents. Do you want to have him reacclimate back to your house for who knows how long, but then send him back to your parents for a second time and start that process all over again?", "NTA", "NTA", "Yeah, she & the cat lived with each other for 10 years. And they still don't like each other! Make your choice & live w/ the repercussions.\n\nNAH", "NTA\n\nKick out the wife. Keep the cat.", "NTA. Get your poor kitty back so he can enjoy the rest of his life with you.", "Sounds like the cat is the asshole.", "NTA.   \n\n\nAnd honestly, after your wife reaction's about taking back your elderly cat, it is hard not to have a dim view of your wife's personality to see anything positive about her.", "NTA- you lost your child AND your cat, and you wife thinks an ultimatum is the way to go?", "NTA. My absolutely bonkers scary cat was amazing with our daughter. Never a scratch, he would gently cuddle her and all the cats seemed to get that she was helpless. Once she got mobile he just avoided her. To me, rehoming a pet is a last resort due to an identified current major problem", "NTA. My ex was mad when I said I would choose my dog over him if they were hanging off a lift I knew my dig for 6yrs vs him for a 1 year).\nMy current boyfriends accepts and respects the live for my pets and knows I would chose them hands down. Run please", "First, I am sorry for your loss. Second, NTA. He's your cat. As other commenters have said, it's most likely not really about the cat himself, but still. This is not reasonable. \n\nIf she continues to push this though, I would question if you want to raise children with someone advocating abandonment a creature you have raised and cared for. \n\nEither way, good luck and bring Bubba home.\n\nEdit to add: I second all the cousuling suggestions. You guys have had a traumatic event, and even if you have great communication, this is a big hurdle. Even for one\nConversation have an impartial mediator can help. My girlfriend and had to do it not that long ago and it was helpful. \n\nSecond, while I think you should get your cat back, be careful. Your wife is not totally herself right now, and.i have seen too many heartbreaking posts about people spouse/family/roommate/parents getting rid of yours let while they are at work and they have to frankly go to shelters finding them. Not saying anything about your wife, but be aware and be careful.", "NTA... what the freak?", "NTA. Bring the cat home, pitch your wife out. She's an ass for even suggesting you rehome your cat before the baby was even due. It's horrible you lost your child, you shouldn't lose your furbaby as well. And a senior cat, to boot? You put its health at risk because of an unwarranted fear. Wifey is a sick piece of work.", "NTA\n\nNever sell your soul to the devil by getting rid of a beloved pet just because your partner made you. A partner like that is not worth having.

It\u2019s about your wife being heartless and uncaring toward you and an innocent, elderly cat. It\u2019s like she bided her time until she found a legit reason to make the cat leave. \n\nBe careful that  if you bring the cat back, she doesn\u2019t find a way to get rid of it.

Second your wife is still grieving and probably grieve for a long time. If you are planning on adopting a child it may be best to leave Bubba at your parent's.  While he may love you he will not love a child who isn't old enough to know to stay away. Cat scratches can cause serious problems.", "NTA - but your wife is.

Your wife sees the return of the cat as confirmation that she can never have a child again. She is also grieving in many ways.

We are in our early 30's and have been trying for a child for some time - due to character limits I won't get into details, but it has been difficult.\n\nIn February, we discovered that she was pregnant! Obviously, we were over the moon with joy. We began to prepare - we did everything you could possibly do to get ready. We planned a baby shower and sent out invitations, we prepared a beautiful room with a custom-made crib by my father in law (who is a very talented woodworker), and we were extremely thorough in baby-proofing our home.\n\nDuring the baby-proofing, my wife started to suggest that we \"get rid of\" my cat, Bubba, who is 12 years old and I've had since he was a kitten. I got him in college, I adopted him and each of my two sisters adopted another kitten from the same litter. Bubba is extremely affectionate to me - so sweet and cuddly. He tolerates my wife, but is not affectionate towards her. To strangers, he is not nice. He has never bitten or scratched anyone, but he does a lot of hissing and yowling at people he is unfamiliar with. My wife was afraid that he'd scare the baby, he wouldn't be welcoming to a newborn, or that he'd hurt her. I argued gently, but eventually acquiesced. In her 28th week of pregnancy, we sent him to live with my parents.\n\nHe was not happy there. My parents said he cried all day and walked around meowing 24 hours a day, looking for me.\n\nTragically, my wife and I lost our child just weeks before she was due. We still don't have a lot of answers, and it's painful to get into. \n\nWe mourned. We were inconsolable for weeks. I still cannot think about it without feeling complete agony and loss.  After a month, we returned to some level of normalcy - as normal as things could be, anyway. We've started to explore adoption.\n\nLast week, I told my wife I was going to pick up Bubba to bring him back home.\n\nShe *exploded*. She said that under no circumstances would she allow him back in our house, and that I had agreed to have him live with my parents. I missed him. He's been my best friend for years, he's been my loyal companion my entire adult life. She told me that I could pretty much choose between her or Bubba. I told her that *obviously* I would choose her, it's not even a question, but that I didn't understand her reasoning and I felt she was being cruel. She'd lived with Bubba for 10 years, and there had never been any problem. The adoption process can take eight to twelve months on average, and I'd like to spend that time having Bubba around.\n\nWe haven't spoken about it since. This is the first fight we've had.

To you it's very important, but to her it's currently superfluous, and while I agree that your feelings should be taken into account, you need to remember that you stood on the sidelines as an observer while she's the one that physically endured the death and delivery of your child.\n\nGood luck.", "She still jumped at the opportunity to get rid of the cat, well before they lost their pregnancy!", "I think people are minimizing what the wife has gone through.  Stillbirth isn\u2019t talked about a lot, and while both parents are grieving, I\u2019m inclined to think that the wife is more traumatized than OP because she was the one carrying the baby.  \n\nStillbirth means you *still have to give birth.* The wife likely had to either push out a baby she knew had already died, or have a major surgery to remove the baby that she knew already died.  And she still had to endure the postpartum hormone crash and recovery from childbirth.  Not to mention, the very fact that her body carried the baby, she gave birth, and now that baby is gone, is referred to as empty arms. \n\nWhile OP is absolutely grieving, his experience is different from his wife\u2019s.  It\u2019s only been *two months* since this happened.  While OP isn\u2019t wrong to want his beloved pet back, the wife as people have mentioned will likely not be able to look at the cat without thinking of her dead baby, if she even manages to forget she has a dead baby.  She may have not liked the cat and *maybe* used the pregnancy as motivation to rehome it, but her feelings at this point in time are not rational and her perspective has now completely changed. That doesn\u2019t make her an AH because she\u2019s still traumatized.  It\u2019s likely just too soon.  \n\nPlus, OP appears to not even have discussed it with her, just announced that the cat was coming back. He could have approached the subject more tactfully.

Even if her reasons then were wrong, the situation has changed.  OP *should* get his cat back, which is why he\u2019s not an AH.  But clearly the cat is a trigger for the wife who has undergone severe trauma moreso than her husband.  No that he hasn\u2019t gone through a traumatic experience too, but his experience is different.  Her extreme reaction and ultimatum are driven by her need for therapy and probably time, as opposed to disdain for the cat, which is why she\u2019s not an AH either.

Cats and babies can be great friends but I wouldn't let a cat into a room with an unsupervised sleeping baby", "You're also more likely to get toxo from raw or undercooked meat than from cats.

He's not hostile, he's just not confident with strangers.\n From my 47 years experience with cats I can say that if you treat a cat right, you won't have problems. Cats have a very distinct body language that you'll need to understand. The main clue is to respect the cat's autonomy (about being touched or carried around). I taught my kids very early to treat a cat respectfully and not harm it. We never had problems with scratching. However, sometimes visitor kids would run after the cat and try to pick it up or even grab its tail. Such situations can be stressful and potentially dangerous. Then it's good when the cat has the possibility to just leave (eg a cat door).\n\nIt's perfectly fine if you don't want a cat around your baby. Just don't get one.

The situation they're in now is a matter of damage control resulting from that asshole move.\n\nIt's understandable that OP caved given that he was trying to minimise stress during her pregnancy, but it wasn't a good thing to demand.\n\nOP's wife is not alone in her emotional distress, and yes I know she carried that child under her heart for months, but it is still unfair of her to make the demand that her needs eclipse everyone else's. And yes, I know grief is selfish...but sometimes you have to call people on their selfishness when it hurts other people. OP has also suffered the loss of their baby; he shares her grief. The cat is in distress from being uprooted and abandoned by the person it loves; however her feelings about it are tangled up with her loss, it cannot be denied that she caused that animal's distress. The humans can get counselling and talk things through, but the cat is dependent on humans to fulfil its needs.  \n\nThat said, bringing the cat home right now may make things worse for everyone including the cat - it's already stressed and feeling abandoned, and it shouldn't be coming home to find itself at the centre of a domestic dispute and possibly triggering someone's grief/anger/loathing due to something it had absolutely no control over. \n\nOP needs to get his wife's emotions out in the open, with a neutral party there to help them both, so that they can address irrationalities and misdirected blame, and resolve the emotions behind all of this *before* he brings the cat back home.

Now that the poor baby is gone, here comes the cat as this huge billboard: I can live here because your baby is dead and you\u2019ll probably never get to have another one. Add in her grief and postpartum hormones, I can see why she couldn\u2019t bear to have the cat around. Of course OP is suffering too, and having his pet back would be comforting to him. There\u2019s NAH, just two people dealing with loss. I do think though that some more time should pass before discussing the cat coming home. He should not unilaterally decide. They should also look into how to put cats at ease with new people before trying for another child.

However, towards kids he would swat them if they pet him wrong. I was never mean, but I will say I probably wasn\u2019t the most gentle either. My parents would reprimand me for bothering the cat whenever I got scratched and I did eventually learn to leave him alone.

She didn't get rid of the cat, just was very cautious when she brought me home. My nursery room door was always closed when I was in it, and it was a no cat zone for well over a year. Balloon (his name, because he just kept growing bigger as a kitten, like a cat shaped balloon), also had a baby free zone of the room his food and litter were in (don't worry, big room, litter very far away from food). My mom had a strict rule with him of don't bother me when I'm holding the baby, and would give him his favorite treat of deli ham when he was successful in not being a total pest. She also would make sure to dote on him when I was down for a nap. He only freaked out a little bit the first few weeks seeing me there, then he calmed down. By the time I started crawling that cat was my best friend, he and our dog both helped encourage me to start walking, but when Toto got too rowdy around me Balloon would step up and give him a swat to protect me. Cats, even ornery, grumpy, absolute units of alley cats, can learn, they can take cues from their humans about how to act around a baby. I'm sure if at any point the cat actually hurt me without any provocation (I did have to learn the hard way that you don't touch a cat's tail with force or malintent), my mom would have looked into more intensive training or re-homing him until I was bigger, but never in her life would she have entirely given away that cat, he was in her life for nearly twice as long as my father by the time I was born, and had been there when my mother had gone through a lot of difficult times. And because my mom loved both the cat and me, eventually it worked out and I had a cat buddy from birth. We were lucky, some cats can't get used to a baby for some reason, but put in the work and try before you just ship them off to someone else, it's only fair to the cat to give them a chance, they can learn if you make the effort to teach them.", "So the cat tells others they don\u2019t want to be bothered by hissing.

I would say them being vocal is pretty nice because the alternative is guessing if the cat wants attention then they swat at you cause you read them wrong.

Think of it like taking off your wedding ring after a spouse dies, or redecorating the bedroom of a child that passed. I can bet none of you woukd be ready to do so two months after a loss. Regardless of the motivation for rehoming the cat in the first place, he is now a living breathing neon sign that her baby is never coming home. Now, agreed the reasons for initially getting rid of the cat are sketchy, and it may be she always wanted to get rid of it.  However, that is moot because this is no longer about the cat, this is now about the child that died. \n\nTo understand better let's say it's a painting not a cat.  Wife moves in with husband, he has an old painting she doesn't like.  She tolerates the painting because she loves him, and she's able to generally ignore it.  She finds out she's pregnant and wants to get rid of it to decorate a nursery. After alot of arguments, he agrees and they build a nursery. The baby passes away. Now, he says well since we don't need the nursery anymore, I am going to bring my painting back. In this hypothetical situation most of this sub would find him to be the AH for being callous about her feelings so soon after the death of her child. The difference is that is is a living breathing animal, not a painting. An animal he loves and misses and provides comfort to him. But to her its a giant neon sign screaming her child is never coming home. Her feelings about the painting/cat before all this happened are moot at this point. It's about what it symbolizes to her at this moment, and what it symbolizes to him at this moment.

Even when children are adopted at birth, the separation is traumatic for the child. As the child gets older, they may feel that they were rejected, or somehow not good enough. They may have trouble coping with the loss of their birth family, even if they're happy with their adopted family, even if their birth family was unsafe for them. Adoptive parents need to be able to nurture their children and help them cope with that trauma and do it without the child's trauma response being unanticipated and traumatic to *them.*\n\nWhen people adopt solely because they're unable to have a bio child, they usually have their own traumatic past. Infertility can be *very* traumatic, and OP suggests that he and his wife have been through a long and very trying time. Then they finally succeeded in conceiving, and the child was stillborn. Something like that usually just wrecks a person. So they've got traumas on top of traumas, and instead of taking time to grieve their child and seek help to deal with their own traumas, they just want to get a baby wherever they can get one.\n\nIt's a recipe for disaster. The likelihood is that it makes everybody's trauma worse. It certainly doesn't resolve the parents' grief over not being able to have a bio child.\n\nWorst of all is if they unexpectedly conceive after adopting. They have their \"miracle\" baby, the baby they really wanted all along, and it soon becomes all too clear to the adoptive child that the parents consider them second best, or even a mistake.\n\nIf you adopt, you *should* want a child. Obviously. But it should never be *just* about what you want. It should always be primarily about what the child needs. And no child needs severely traumatized parents who are adopting out of desperation, have not dealt with their own trauma, and are in no way prepared to deal with the child's.", "We do actually do that. If the 10 year old can't be helped with therapy and other interventions then yes they get removed from the home for the safety of others. They go to inpatient behavioral health treatment until they are deemed safe. The other option is they go to a trusted guardian or foster care. If they have already committed crimes or assault they may be put in juvenile detention as well. So no we don't just tolerate even a child attacking another child. You've clearly never worked with dangerous children before. We had an elementary school aged child punch a hole in the wall in the ED because they weren't getting their way. I've had kids try to rip thermostats off the wall. Threaten to set the building on fire. Threaten to gut or stab staff. Kids can be just as dangerous as adults. Pets can also be dangerous at times. Most pets are fine but some do become aggressive when a baby is brought home. In some cases extremely aggressive. There are cases of dogs trying to break down doors and even attacking their long term owners to get to babies. There are cases of cats hissing and scratching and even running at babies or chasing toddlers and small children. Animals like humans have personalities and if one absolutely hates small children or babies then it's absolutely appropriate to rehome them to a place that doesn't have small children for both the pets sake and the child. The pet won't be happy in the home with the child and the child won't be safe with the pet. Neither pet nor child should have to be uncomfortable or unsafe in their own home. I have cats myself. One of my cats showed very obvious signs of abuse after we brought them home. They were scared but never hurt my kids. Had they been aggressive with my kids and didn't respond to pet therapy/training I would have found them a loving home without children where my cat wouldn't have to be scared or uncomfortable and my kids would be safe. Being a responsible pet owner doesn't mean keeping your pet no matter what. Being a good parent doesn't mean yes pets or no pets.

The reaction to working on adoption asap is being field by grief and \"need\" to fill that void. \"There's supposed to be a baby so there needs to be a baby and that will make everything better.\" It's an understandable thought and feeling. However, I don't think OP and his wife are there yet. They need more time, couples and individual therapy is a good idea. Grief takes time, some need more, some need less. 2 months after the trauma, this is \"rebound\" thinking. So, there is a chance that if they followed through with adoption this soon, it would essentially be a \"rebound\" baby/child. And just like the cat, the adopted baby/child could end up being a reminder of the loss that was suffered. In which case, there could be a lot of resentment and just overall wouldn't be good for anyone involved. \n\nOP while it's perfectly fine to talk about and look into, I would wait until you go forward with any plans to adopt. Give both of yourselves more time. As far as Bubba goes, it's the same thing, give it time. The last thing you want is for your wife to start taking her grief and anger out on him. I understand you need Bubba though, so, there needs to be a compromise to make sure you are both getting the support and love that you need. Go visit Bubba and spend some time with him. Wait until after the holidays (and please give it more time than the 1st or 2nd, don't become an ah) and talk to your wife again. Maybe the two of you can go to your parents. I kind of suggest this because grief can do amazing things when it comes to animals. While it may not be something that happens, I also wouldn't be surprised if the two of you went to your parents, and while wife was sitting on the sofa Bubba came up to her and cuddled. I do not want to get any hopes up or anything of the sort. But, just like relationships between people can change when something big, life changing and/or traumatic happens, relationships between animals and humans can to. I don't want to say bring Bubba home for a weekend and see how it goes (with wife's agreement obviously) because I would worry that would be traumatic for Bubba to come home to be ripped away again.\n\nGive both of yourselves time, do what you can to be there and be a support and comfort to her. She is going through this completely differently than you are. But that doesn't mean one person's grief is more important, or worse, than the others. You need the love and support you need also.

To lose that \u201cjust a few weeks\u201d before birth is not just devastating as a loss of a person, but also feels unfair for the body - like she went through all the pains of pregnancy, some which are still lingering post stillbirth : feeling the hip pain, being unable to breath, having your bones change forever, having her boobs engorge and start producing colostrum - for 8 months to yield nothing?

Men like wives that smile and don't burden them with their sadness. Look, I know you are somewhat suffering too, but the fact that you are even talking about even somewhat getting back to normal after only a  month means you are nowhere near to feeling what she does at all. Especially since she not only lost a child, but SHE HAD THE CHILD DIE IN HER BODY AND HAD TO GIVE BIRTH TO HER DEAD BABY. Just actually think about that for one minute, not just seeing your wife go through it but actually imagine you yourself..... I know for a fact you can't even come close to comprehending even one fraction of the real pain and horror of not only going through that but having to re-live it constantly or you would be comforting your wife now and not complaining about her daring to need anything from you and talking about normalacy.  I guarantee you that she is not feeling any normalacy at all and is trying to be strong for YOU, she will have nightmares reliving HER DEAD CHILD IN HER BODY for her whole life and will NEVER truely heal from that, and you obviously don't have any clue or you wouldn't be here begrudging her one thing.... A woman who you said never really fought with you seriously before, and in her darkest hour  you want to seriously bring in a constant reminder of all the pain and wave it in her face ... Not enough she has to re-live giving birth to her dead child every night in her sleep, feels the ghost of the child in her sore  post-partum body so she literally both  physically and emotionally feels the loss every second of her life, has  postpartum depression and bereavement depression at the same time, and also she has lost you as a support she is realizing because you just made it obvious to her that you will never feel the same pain she does or understand it and she certainly feels she can't talk to you about anything when you made her think you're  clueless or you wouldn't have even thought it would be ok to even ask to bring that cat back, just to have another reminder of how the child isn't here, and another trigger for the memory of giving birth to her dead baby every single time she sees the cat so she has no peace sleeping or awake. But by all means... sure it's the one thing she ever really fought you over, never mind that she probably never liked the cat but accepted him because of her love of you, since she seems to always want you happy until she had to put a child first and then her sanity first, but no go ahead and be selfish and complain to the world about her being such an a hole over simply wanting an environment where she at least has the hope to one day not think about her dead child for 1 second. For the love of all that is good and holy if you  love this woman at all don't even bring that cat back up ever again. Even if she let's you bring it back she will never forgive you, and I guarantee you she will secretly hate you for it till the day she dies. Most couples don't survive a stillbirth, because men can't understand the trauma and they belittle and gaslight their wives and say she's being manipulative if they need one thing to help them survive. So women swallow their feelings, and just let themselves die inside and over time the husband may or may not one day finally notice his wife never really has the same light in her eyes anymore  and be like \"wow what happened\" but he won't really care just divorce her and move on...just like when a woman gets cancer or anything else that might make her show sadness or worse dare ask a man to make a sacrifice without being a huge a hole about it. Therapy won't work with you guys because you will just use it as an excuse to talk about what YOU want, and she obviously has already given up trying to make you understand things from her perspective or care about her, and is probably too depressed and emotionally exhausted to even try at this point, and even everyone suggesting therapy is suggesting only as a way to talk her into letting the cat back, and maybe she will since she will feel out-numbered and alone and just give up and die inside, but I'm sure you're fine with that, or you'd be by her side asking her what she needs instead of going on the internet whining to people about your deeply traumatized wife having the nerve to put her foot down once and ask you not to traumatize her further, and using this forum to feel justified about being an asshole since other clueless people that have no idea what its like to constantly be viscerally reminded of giving birth to your dead baby think so too, and your wife hopefully will find this thread one day and it will confirm to her no one cares about her, and she doesn't matter at all, and she should give up , and just give you whatever you want and hopefully she will just die inside soon , so she doesn't have to feel anything at all and just be a smiling empty shell for you... hooray for you!

The kid is weary of new people, furrowing his brow and huffing before walking away anytime someone new is around, but has never shown any violent tendencies.

Meanwhile, she isn't fond of the kid but just goes on like nothing is bothering her. \n\nNow fast forward to the pregnancy and imminent birth of OP and wife's baby. Halfway into her pregnancy, she begins mentioning \"I think your son should go live with your parents because I'm worried about him around our child.\" First off, most people would agree the wife is over the line and OP would be a dumbass to agree to this. But let's assume OP interprets her request as a temporary arrangement, so the kid goes to live with the grandparents\n\nSadly, the newborn ends up being stillborn and over the month after, OP's son continues to live with the grandparents while OP and his wife grieve, however the kid has been miserable living with his grandparents. Frequently crying and voicing how much he misses his daddy. After taking the needed time to mourn, OP one day says to his wife \"I'm going to go pick up my son\" but to his surprise the wife lashes out, telling him that his son is never coming back to live with them.\n\nI, and most others I'd hope, would agree this is an insane demand. Even if OP's wife sees the son as a symbol of the stillbirth because that kid reminds her of the child she just lost, she has no ground to tell OP he cannot have his son back in the house. Again, I'm sympathetic to OP's wife and their situation, but no way in hell would I stand for that.\n\nOP's wife should have brought these concerns up loooong before the pregnancy but instead waited until she had leverage with the upcoming birth. In my opinion, this is nothing more than her having to, justifiably, live with the \"consequences\" of her choice to not have that conversation earlier. If OP can forgive her for this obviously manipulative behaviour, then he should console her and support her through this traumatic event, but there is no reason the cat can't be there during the healing process other than she doesn't want it there cause she doesn't like the thing, which is completely invalid in the first place.\n\nOP, if you see this, stand up for yourself and get your Bubba back. In my opinion, this shouldn't be YOUR decision to choose the cat over her, it is HER decision if she is willing to live with you and Bubba or if that is her deal breaker she is willing to end your marriage over. If I was in your situation, there'd be no hesitation to bring my cat home and I'd seriously be reconsidering having/adopting a child with that person because clearly our values are not aligned.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add, the fact the cat is distressed and upset by the absence of his owner, and that no one can really communicate the situation to the cat, is almost worse than my example with the kid because at least in that scenario the grandparents and the father can try to help the kid understand that OP and his wife just need some time with each other. The cat on the other hand, just thinks they were abandoned by their owner and even if OP is able to visit fairly often, the cat doesn't know when or if OP  is ever coming back when he leaves.", "Adopting because you want a baby isn't a good reason.

That is cruel to the cat to move them around so much when the change clearly makes the cat miserable.  \n\nIf the cat really isn\u2019t working out at the parents\u2019 house, and OP thinks it might be better in another home, then rehome the cat, but don\u2019t bring him back just so OP can give him right back.

This shit takes *time*.

This is a lot. There are therapists who specialize in reproductive counseling for couples dealing with the kinds of issues y\u2019all are facing. \n\nHaving dealt with fertility issues myself and been in that support community, that part may be hitting your wife harder than you know. She has just been told that her body doesn\u2019t work right. That she is incapable of a normative human experience. That her body is why y\u2019all\u2019s baby died. And a lot of people will tell or insinuate that it\u2019s her fault (it is not). This kind of devastation can lead to serious mental health concerns. If she is struggling with this news, a personal therapist specializing in reproductive issues might be a good idea. \n\nNow off topic a bit, Y\u2019all may have already explored all this, IDK. Get a second opinion from a specialist on y\u2019all\u2019s ability for kids. Surrogacy is also an option if carrying a child is the only problem. Surrogacy is y\u2019all\u2019s embryo carried by another woman; it would still be yalls bio kid (except for the mitochondria).\n\nAnd also whats up with your wife kicking your cat out? That\u2019s not right. Unless the cat is an outlier of violence, cats and babies coexist just fine. Don\u2019t let it sleep with the baby or leave the baby unattended with it, but that should be easy enough with a senior cat. Does she have any cat-trauma in her past?", "I mean\u2026yeah! A small scratch wouldn\u2019t traumatize a baby! When I was 2, I got horribly attacked by a mama cat (kittens were only just starting to walk and see).

Her favorite pets now are dogs. \n\nChildren react differently to different situations. However, to just ASSUME an animal will attack and traumatize a child is based off the adults instinct. OPs wife is probably \u201cscared\u201d of cats and assumed her child would be too. \n\nThat didn\u2019t give her the right to get rid of OPs best friend and companion.
