We are in our early 30's and have been trying for a child for some time - due to character limits I won't get into details, but it has been difficult.\n\nIn February, we discovered that she was pregnant! Obviously, we were over the moon with joy. We began to prepare - we did everything you could possibly do to get ready. We planned a baby shower and sent out invitations, we prepared a beautiful room with a custom-made crib by my father in law (who is a very talented woodworker), and we were extremely thorough in baby-proofing our home.\n\nDuring the baby-proofing, my wife started to suggest that we \"get rid of\" my cat, Bubba, who is 12 years old and I've had since he was a kitten. I got him in college, I adopted him and each of my two sisters adopted another kitten from the same litter. Bubba is extremely affectionate to me - so sweet and cuddly. He tolerates my wife, but is not affectionate towards her. To strangers, he is not nice. He has never bitten or scratched anyone, but he does a lot of hissing and yowling at people he is unfamiliar with. My wife was afraid that he'd scare the baby, he wouldn't be welcoming to a newborn, or that he'd hurt her. I argued gently, but eventually acquiesced. In her 28th week of pregnancy, we sent him to live with my parents.\n\nHe was not happy there. My parents said he cried all day and walked around meowing 24 hours a day, looking for me.\n\nTragically, my wife and I lost our child just weeks before she was due. We still don't have a lot of answers, and it's painful to get into. \n\nWe mourned. We were inconsolable for weeks. I still cannot think about it without feeling complete agony and loss.  After a month, we returned to some level of normalcy - as normal as things could be, anyway. We've started to explore adoption.\n\nLast week, I told my wife I was going to pick up Bubba to bring him back home.\n\nShe *exploded*. She said that under no circumstances would she allow him back in our house, and that I had agreed to have him live with my parents. I missed him. He's been my best friend for years, he's been my loyal companion my entire adult life. She told me that I could pretty much choose between her or Bubba. I told her that *obviously* I would choose her, it's not even a question, but that I didn't understand her reasoning and I felt she was being cruel. She'd lived with Bubba for 10 years, and there had never been any problem. The adoption process can take eight to twelve months on average, and I'd like to spend that time having Bubba around.\n\nWe haven't spoken about it since. This is the first fight we've had. Am I being unreasonable/the asshole in wanting my cat back?", "created_utc": 1671849620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztzoc7/aita_for_wanting_to_bring_my_cat_back_into_my/", "score": 220, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should never have to get rid of Bubba. I'm sure to you Bubba is also an important part of the family. Cats hissing is NOT a sign of violence but a sign of fear. My sister who recently had a baby has a cat who also hisses at strangers but is cuddly with his owners. Honestly, he can't even tell that her baby is a human at all and only ever sniffs her or avoids her. On top of that, a child will not be afraid of a cat unless they are raised to be or are HORRIBLY hurt. A tiny scratch will not traumatize a baby.", "NTA. And you shouldn't had get rid of the cat in the first place.", "To be honest, I\u2019d choose my cat. She knows what he means to you, and seems like a monster for wanting him gone for a baby (especially with there being no issues).", "Info: do you think she sees this as you giving up on your ability to have kids, a thing she wasn\u2019t ready for?

This is not about Bubba.\n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong, OP. Given the context of first fight in 10 years (ie\u2026clearly you\u2019re not communicating with each other, and now something painful has happened and you\u2019re fighting \u201cabout Bubba\u201d).\n\nNAH", "NTA. This is your cats last years of life, don\u2019t make them miserable for him.", "Get your cat back NTA", "NTA.

Counseling is a must. Take it from one grieving parent to another, counseling over reddit.\n\nDo not show her this thread to prove a point. and I mean that from a place of love.\n\nFrom a grieving Mom who was illogical and hard to deal with.", "NAH for wanting to bring the cat back - he has been your feline friend so of course you\u2019d like him around. Probably for your wife the cat coming back is just another reminder that she doesn\u2019t have your child there and I\u2019m sure that stings extra. I am really really sorry for your loss. \u2764\ufe0f", "NAH. Normally, I\u2019d be all up in arms about you having to give up your cat. I have a fifteen-year-old cat who is literally my favorite thing in the world, and I\u2019d willingly choose her over 99.9% of all human beings on the planet. I really, really feel for you. But your wife is not only grieving the loss of a child but also her ability to physically give birth to her own children. I have no children, but I can imagine how awful she feels. To her, bringing the cat back represents giving up on having a baby, but having your cat back would probably really help you with your grief. Meanwhile, Bubba\u2019s also grieving the loss of his favorite person! It stinks that there\u2019s no neat way to resolve this. Are y\u2019all seeing a counselor or anything? These might be issues y\u2019all could better resolve with a third party. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sorry for all the loss y\u2019all have been experiencing lately and really hope you guys can find peace.", "NTA. But also I\u2019d like to say that adopting a replacement for the child you are mourning is awful too. Im that adopted child and it\u2019s shitty.", "NAH Your wife is afraid that you secretly think that you two will never have children. In her mind, you would not bring your cat back home only to rehome him in a couple of months.", "I think it would be best to try therapy before anything else. Your wife just lost the baby she was growing for 9 months and that certainly takes a toll on someone.", "Buddy. Get the damn cat back why in the hell did you Even get rid of it in the first place. \n\nAs a woman who's gone through a miscarriage I get it but her anger is misplaced and she needs therapy and healing. Not to screamed ultimatum and take away from you.", "There's a lot of under the surface emotional stuff that you and your wife are going through here.\n\nI'm 95% certain that your wife isn't mad at the cat, but is probably feeling many things about what the cat means. \n\nRecommending counseling for you and her or both if not already being done. \n\nNAH", "Nta. This is a bizarre response and I hate to minimize it to stress your wife is under from the loss but thats most likely what it is (not that it isnt stressful and painful for you as well it absolutely is).\n\nIt isnt fair that you had to give away a more senior aged kitten. I wouldn't go so far as to suggest bringing Bubba back against her wishes but I say set a hard limit that you will bring him back?\n\nLike \"ok hon one more month of him at my folks then he is coming home\".\n\nShe can't come up with a good reason not to have him back and he would make you feel better? If she resents that its kind of selfish honestly.\n\nNta", "NAH\n\nYou miss your cat and want it back. For you, that sits on its own.\n\nYour wife is dealing with the loss of the child that was inside of her, the knowledge that it\u2019s her body that is preventing that happening again (and I can tell you that, no matter how strong everyone is on the \u2018it\u2019s not your fault\u2019 message, that blame gets internalised anyway), and an uncertain future facing adoption. For her, the return of the cat is linked and could be taken as you giving up on any future child (especially since, presumably, you\u2019d have to get rid of it again if you did in fact adopt).\n\nI think emotions are running high here and you need to talk through them. Do consider though if this is best for the cat in the long run if you\u2019re just going to return it to your parents\u2019 house at a future date if adoption is successful.\n\nGood luck.", "She\u2019s probably jealous and this has hit a nerve. You get your affectionate cat and she has no baby. Take your time with her on this, from her reaction she is hurt and needs time.\nBtw- shape of her uterus is the issue with fertility? I\u2019d suggest seeking a second opinion with ob on that especially if it\u2019s bicornuate or unicornate.", "NAH. It hasn't been very long since your agonizing loss and you are both in a really delicate place right now. Yelling at you like that was definitely an overreaction, but it sounds like there might be more going on here- like maybe she feels taking back the cat means you're giving up on having a baby or something. This deserves a calm conversation with a couples counselor, not an ultimatum.", "NTA. TBH I would t have let the cat leave to start w", "NTA. I have 2 cats I've had for 6 yrs now. One of them hates pretty much anyone who doesn't live in the house. Admittedly she can be aggressive but she is very sweet to us. My mom mentioned I should get rid of her before I had my baby. That was a year ago. The cat doesn't care about the baby at all. She comes over sniffs him sometimes and walks away. You never know how animals will react but you can give them a chance.", "NTA.  Everyone grieves differently and having your cat back will be good for you.  Getting your car back isn\u2019t symbolic of never having a baby.  They aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.  Good luck", "NTA for wanting your cat back, but your wife probably feels on some level like you've given up on having kids if you're taking back a cat you rehomed for the safety of an anticipated child. You are un-baby-proofing the house. You are returning to, and embracing, a normal in which you two are not parents and are not going to be parents in the near future. She's probably still grieving heavily for your miscarried child, and I'd imagine she's really sensitive to feeling like your lost kid is being erased. \n\nShe also knows that when you guys adopt or foster or get pregnant again, she'll probably have to fight you all over again to get rid of your cat that she's probably always resented.\n\nI don't think this makes you the asshole for wanting to have your cat back (and the reason I'm going with NTA instead of N A H is because I think her demanding to dump the cat in the first place was an AH move - it's pretty shitty to suddenly dump a senior pet (or any pet) because of a new kid or pet), but consider that for her, it's probably not really about the cat himself so much as what he represents to her - a time in your lives together when you are not parents.", "Nah. Don\u2019t bring the cat home. I\u2019m afraid the cat will turn up missing one day. If you do bring the cat back then you better make it known that if cat turns up missing she is out!", "NTA but your wife is. You are Bubba's person. I don't even like cats but my heart hurts for this poor guy.", "NTA you shouldnt of gotten rid of the cat in the first place", "The cat was always honest w/it\u2019s indifference toward the wife but the wife hid hers. Trust the cat.", "NTA. Your wife was unreasonable to tell you to send him to live with your parents in the first place. Honestly I think it's crazy that you did this after a full decade of all living together. Unless he's previously shown aggression towards children there's also no reason to believe he would harm a baby anyway. Also...the adoption process could take 8-12 MONTHS? Where the hell do you live? In most places infant adoption is more likely to take 8-12 years, well beyond the average lifespan of a cat.", "NTA.\n\nCat Behavior Specialists recommend that a cat gets used to the baby's surroundings before it comes to exist, then you slowly introduce them by using smell, and sound before introducing them with touch and eyesight. Bubba would've likely warmed up to your baby had your baby not been stillbirth.\n\nIt honestly sounds like your wife wanted to look for an excuse to get rid of Bubba and found it with your baby, since you want the cat back she's showing you her true colors. There's evidence to suggest that pets are good therapeutic animals especially with going through loss so Bubba would be a great therapeutic pet for you as you get through this terrible time in your life.\n\nI have a 3 year old cat named Prince and if my girlfriend or wife made me choose between him and her then she should better start packing her bags because she's out the door, I don't care if it's petty.", "Hey! so I'd like to draw attention to something:\n\n>She exploded. She said that under no circumstances would she allow him back in our house, and that I had agreed to have him live with my parents. I missed him. He's been my best friend for years, he's been my loyal companion my entire adult life. She told me that I could pretty much choose between her or Bubba.\n\nShe's always hated the cat, dude. she just finally found a way to get rid of him. wich is just gross.\n\nIf I were in this position I'd let her know I didn't want to adopt a baby until the cat passes. or ya know, just choose the cat. \n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d chose the cat", "NTA you love the cat, he's family, it's not fair that you have to keep hurting without him \\[or him without you\\] esp if you don't have a reason to not bring him home.", "NTA but definitely choose the cat over the wife", "Nta, she is being cruel :/ I am sorry for your loss. Your cat matters though and he misses you, and I\u2019m sure it would be a comfort to you also to have him around :( honestly, I don\u2019t think you needed to take him to your parents house in the first place. Lots of \u201cone person cats\u201d live in houses with babies. There probably aren\u2019t many cats in existence that are particularly \u201cwelcoming\u201d to an infant or a toddler- who are loud and don\u2019t understand cat boundaries. Cats tolerate, it\u2019s what they do.", "nta but you do kind of suck for getting rid of him in the first place.", "NAH. I think the fact that your wife, and you as well, are both still grieving the loss of your child needs to really frame this conversation. Grief does funny things to you and grief over the loss of your child doesn't go away after a matter of weeks. It actually doesn't ever really go away, according to the bereavement specialist I saw after a miscarriage earlier this year, you just sort of grow around it and learn to live with it.\n\nI understand your desire for comfort and familiarity in your grief, and for wanting your much loved pet back in your day to day life. \n\nBut I suspect your wife has been badly triggered by it because \"getting rid of the cat\" was part of baby proofing, and bringing the cat back has a finality (and/or guilt) to it that she can't cope with at the moment - it means her baby you both baby-proofed for isn't ever going to come home to live in the house with you. \n\nThe cat can't substitute for your lost child sadly. Not even another baby - biological or adopted - will replace her baby. Probably the most concerning part of this whole situation for me is that you lost your baby in October, and you are already jumping head first into the adoption process. You both really need time to process your grief first.\n\nI hope for your sake and the cat's sake your wife comes around to the idea of having Bubba back in the house, but in the meantime from personal experience I highly recommend grief counselling.", "Oh OP. Hugs. So many hugs, I am so sorry for your loss. NTA!! \n\nI understand her fear and I understand why you agreed to this. If I may say; one month is not at all a long time. I just lost my partner six months ago, in literal front of me, to cancer and I am just now feeling I might be an actual human. You both have SO far to go, separate and together. \n\nNot my business but maybe pause on that adoption right now, to allow yourself time and space to process the trauma, the loss and to find where you are as a couple once everything isn\u2019t so dark every moment. \n\nIf I had to guess I would say Bubba is a physical reminder that the baby isn\u2019t here. I am guessing she doesn\u2019t know how to say that and might not even recognize it.  She\u2019s not angry at Bubba or you; she\u2019s angry her child is not with her. She might feel like you\u2019re lessening the loss by wanting to so quickly go back to a life with a cat, maybe she feels you\u2019re moving on too quickly. I would suspect it\u2019s a lot of these things on top of the loss of your beautiful child. \n\nIf you\u2019ve always had a great relationship until now, don\u2019t pick the cat. Send it with mom for a bit longer; it\u2019s hard I know but your wife is in a hell that many don\u2019t come out of. She\u2019s your focus RN", "I think you've screwed yourself over. I don't think you should have given him up in the first place, I think you should have been very wary with him around a child like you should be with any pet but not given him up. Now that you have, if you bring him home and then adopt a child and turf the poor cat out again it will be even more stressful for him. I could understand that she may think that if the cat comes back in to the house then maybe you'll just stop wanting a child all together. She hasn't behaved the right way about any of this, from jumping the gun and making demands and blowing up at you but she's grieving. I think you need to sit down and talk about this properly and explain where you're both coming from but also try and understand the others point of view.", "YTA for getting rid of the cat in the first place.", "NTA if she can\u2019t tolerate the cat, she isn\u2019t fit to have a kid. Kick her to the curb and bring that good Kitty home!", "NTA, ditch the wife and get your cat back!", "NTA But on a completely different note: don\u2019t adopt or even consider adoption until you both have completely worked through your grief and she has worked through her grief at not being able to have children. Adopted kids are not a substitute for bio kids, but are way too often seen as such.\nOnto the cat issue: you need to have a discussion without fighting or yelling about why she is so against having the cat back.", "I'm actually on your wife's side. If I was in the situation, returning with the cat would make me feel even more defeated. It would be a physical, daily reminder of the missing piece. The both of you just lost a baby. You want comfort from your animal which I understand. Your wife does not have the same relationship with Bubba. Who will comfort her? Not to mention restrict possibilities regarding adoption, and having to make new arrangements with your parents when the time comes to send him back (assuming you agree to do so).\n\nBubba has already had several months to adapt to his new surroundings with your parents. Do you want to have him reacclimate back to your house for who knows how long, but then send him back to your parents for a second time and start that process all over again?", "NTA", "NTA", "Yeah, she & the cat lived with each other for 10 years. And they still don't like each other! Make your choice & live w/ the repercussions.\n\nNAH", "NTA\n\nKick out the wife. Keep the cat.", "NTA. Get your poor kitty back so he can enjoy the rest of his life with you.", "Sounds like the cat is the asshole.", "NTA.   \n\n\nAnd honestly, after your wife reaction's about taking back your elderly cat, it is hard not to have a dim view of your wife's personality to see anything positive about her.", "NTA- you lost your child AND your cat, and you wife thinks an ultimatum is the way to go?", "NTA. My absolutely bonkers scary cat was amazing with our daughter. Never a scratch, he would gently cuddle her and all the cats seemed to get that she was helpless. Once she got mobile he just avoided her. To me, rehoming a pet is a last resort due to an identified current major problem", "NTA. My ex was mad when I said I would choose my dog over him if they were hanging off a lift I knew my dig for 6yrs vs him for a 1 year).\nMy current boyfriends accepts and respects the live for my pets and knows I would chose them hands down. Run please", "First, I am sorry for your loss. Second, NTA. He's your cat. As other commenters have said, it's most likely not really about the cat himself, but still. This is not reasonable. \n\nIf she continues to push this though, I would question if you want to raise children with someone advocating abandonment a creature you have raised and cared for. \n\nEither way, good luck and bring Bubba home.\n\nEdit to add: I second all the cousuling suggestions. You guys have had a traumatic event, and even if you have great communication, this is a big hurdle. Even for one\nConversation have an impartial mediator can help. My girlfriend and had to do it not that long ago and it was helpful. \n\nSecond, while I think you should get your cat back, be careful. Your wife is not totally herself right now, and.i have seen too many heartbreaking posts about people spouse/family/roommate/parents getting rid of yours let while they are at work and they have to frankly go to shelters finding them. Not saying anything about your wife, but be aware and be careful.", "NTA... what the freak?", "NTA. Bring the cat home, pitch your wife out. She's an ass for even suggesting you rehome your cat before the baby was even due. It's horrible you lost your child, you shouldn't lose your furbaby as well. And a senior cat, to boot? You put its health at risk because of an unwarranted fear. Wifey is a sick piece of work.", "NTA\n\nNever sell your soul to the devil by getting rid of a beloved pet just because your partner made you. A partner like that is not worth having. And there\u2019s no guarantee the partner will stick around after your pet is gone. \n\nI\u2019m on my 10th dog, and there\u2019s not one I\u2019d give away because I was pressured to. \n\nIt\u2019s not about your cat. It\u2019s about your wife being heartless and uncaring toward you and an innocent, elderly cat. It\u2019s like she bided her time until she found a legit reason to make the cat leave. \n\nBe careful that  if you bring the cat back, she doesn\u2019t find a way to get rid of it. Consider for now visiting it at your parents\u2019 house. \n\nI couldn\u2019t be with someone like this. I dumped a few people for this reason. It was an easy choice. \n\nI\u2019m sorry about the loss of your baby. I hope things take a turn for the better for you.", "NTA.  First off  I'm so sorry for your loss. Second your wife is still grieving and probably grieve for a long time. If you are planning on adopting a child it may be best to leave Bubba at your parent's.  While he may love you he will not love a child who isn't old enough to know to stay away. Cat scratches can cause serious problems.", "NTA - but your wife is. You commit to a pet for his whole life - like you should when you want a child. Stand your ground. If she wants to die on that hill her mental health seems to be more of a problem.", "NTA and also wtf. I\u2019d always choose my cats tbh. If my husband and I ever decide to try for a baby, the cats are staying. Pets are a lifetime commitment, and you didn\u2019t even see how the cat would react around a baby.", "No one is TA. Your wife sees the return of the cat as confirmation that she can never have a child again. She is also grieving in many ways. You will be hugging your cat and she will be missing forever the children that she will never hug. Sometimes the unfeeling nature of some Reddit readers amazes me. Put yourself in her place.", "NTA - I would 100% choose my animals over any human that came into my life after them. Period.

I got him in college, I adopted him and each of my two sisters adopted another kitten from the same litter. Bubba is extremely affectionate to me - so sweet and cuddly. He tolerates my wife, but is not affectionate towards her. To strangers, he is not nice. He has never bitten or scratched anyone, but he does a lot of hissing and yowling at people he is unfamiliar with. My wife was afraid that he'd scare the baby, he wouldn't be welcoming to a newborn, or that he'd hurt her. I argued gently, but eventually acquiesced. In her 28th week of pregnancy, we sent him to live with my parents.\n\nHe was not happy there. My parents said he cried all day and walked around meowing 24 hours a day, looking for me.\n\nTragically, my wife and I lost our child just weeks before she was due. We still don't have a lot of answers, and it's painful to get into. \n\nWe mourned. We were inconsolable for weeks. I still cannot think about it without feeling complete agony and loss.  After a month, we returned to some level of normalcy - as normal as things could be, anyway. We've started to explore adoption.\n\nLast week, I told my wife I was going to pick up Bubba to bring him back home.\n\nShe *exploded*. She said that under no circumstances would she allow him back in our house, and that I had agreed to have him live with my parents. I missed him. He's been my best friend for years, he's been my loyal companion my entire adult life. She told me that I could pretty much choose between her or Bubba. I told her that *obviously* I would choose her, it's not even a question, but that I didn't understand her reasoning and I felt she was being cruel. She'd lived with Bubba for 10 years, and there had never been any problem. The adoption process can take eight to twelve months on average, and I'd like to spend that time having Bubba around.\n\nWe haven't spoken about it since. This is the first fight we've had. Am I being unreasonable/the asshole in wanting my cat back?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That\u2019s really tough. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know your wife, but my husband and I are in a group for parents and families who lost children (TEARS foundation).
