{"id": 27869, "submission_id": "16v88i7", "title": "AITA for offering to pay for my niece\u2019s riding lessons?", "selftext": "My (F28) stepsister Lindsay (F28) got pregnant at 17 and had her now 11 year old daughter, Shiv. It was a pretty hard time for Lindsay but also the whole family (parents almost got divorced over it, there was ex drama, etc.) and honestly no one\u2019s relationships were ever the same. \n\nI moved a couple of hours away and now live a couple of hours flight away from both Lindsay and our parents. I am not really big on kids, and Lindsay and I barely talk, so I didn\u2019t have much of a relationship with Shiv as she grew up, I\u2019d just show up to birthday dinners and bring gifts, and I contributed to an education fund my stepfather set up for her, but I never really knew her. \n\nEarlier this year, Shiv was doing a family tree project at school and I guess got interested in my mother\u2019s family, and started Googling everybody. According to my stepfather, she asked him a lot of questions about me and found my social media and found out I\u2019m big into horses, which she is, too. She messaged me (my stepfather asked if it was okay she contacted me) and now we talk regularly. She\u2019s a nice kid, as kids go.\n\nWhen she came to visit me with the parents over the summer, we went riding almost every day, and even though it was her first time doing it, she was a natural and she really loved it. Since then, she\u2019s been constantly talking about it and saying how much she misses it. My parents got her a block of ten riding group lessons as a gift (she\u2019s loving those) but they can\u2019t afford to support her in the sport long term. She has a real passion for horses and riding but Lindsay is basically a single mother and can\u2019t afford lessons for her long term either. \n\nI contacted Lindsay and offered to pay for Shiv\u2019s private riding lessons as long as she wants them. I said I would take responsibility for all the associated costs (equipment etc) even if she wants to compete. It\u2019s not a huge amount for me and I was lucky enough to have parents, partly my stepdad as well, supporting my passions my whole life so why wouldn\u2019t I want to help Shiv? \n\nLindsay went OFF at me. She said so many things I won\u2019t even type but she accused me of throwing money around to buy her daughter\u2019s affection and humiliate her. She said I shouldn\u2019t make her choose between taking an opportunity away from her daughter or feeling like dirt compared to me \u201clike always\u201d because I steal everything from her. She also said it was wrong of me to not pay any attention to Shiv for all the years Lindsay struggled raising her and circle back now to be her favourite. \n\nTo me, none of that reflects the reasons I made the offer, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t overstep. So I\u2019m looking for some third party opinions. Was it wrong of me to bring it up?", "created_utc": 1695984344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16v88i7/aita_for_offering_to_pay_for_my_nieces_riding/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Great gesture.\n\nSS feels like you are trying to buy her daughter's affections.  Have you spoken to your SD and Mom about her reaction?", "NTA  \n\n\nShe's being petty, she made the decision to get pregnant when she couldn't support a child and now doesn't want help because it makes her feel she cant support her childs good fortunes (which she cant).  \n\n\nNo winning with a delusional person like that  \n\n\nAlso not to be mean, but why did she name her kid after a knife", "NTA. It's a wonderful thing that Shiv has someone in her life who's not only able but also willing to support her passion, and it's a shame that her mother is too blinded by her jealousy of you to see what a wonderful opportunity this is for Shiv. If possible, I would recommend you try to have a talk with Lindsay about your reasons for not being in Shiv's life until now and your reasons for wanting to support her interest in riding. Try to make it clear that this isn't about you or Lindsay, it's about supporting Shiv.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to do a nice thing and you went about it in a respectful way by asking Lindsay on the down-low. Sounds like she's insecure about you being better off than she is.", "NTA-this is the realities of life. Everything is always in the eye of the beholder. Lindsey\u2019s interpretation of the past 11 years is hers. Yours is yours. \n\nYou can now choose to respect Lindsey\u2019s decision, or you can choose to offer the funding through the grandpa since Lindsey appears to be already okay with that. If it were me, I would let Lindsey choose between the two, but you don\u2019t have to do that. You could decide for yourself.", "NTA. It is a super sweet offer for your niece.\n\nBut I see also your step sisters side. Most likly Shiv is talking non stop of how much fun it was with you and that the two of you get riding every day. And she wish she would meet you more often. This can hurt a mother who gave up everything to raise her child, who loves aunty now more than her.\n\nHopefully Lindsay will cool off in a few days and you might talk to her again about it. May argue that it will also help their relationship if Mommy is also taking her horse riding (? - althaugh you are paying, Lindsy still will be the person driving her daughter to the stables.", "A good parent would be happy to watch their kids participate in something that makes them happy. I don\u2019t get why your sis wants to take this away from her daughter. It\u2019s quite sad. She should put her ego aside and think what is best for Shiv.", "NTA. Shiv contacted you. Lindsay she should've told Shiv not to contact you if she has a problem with you and not allowed her to visit, at least not until she worked out her issues. I think it's kind that you're offering to pay for this and extremely generous that you're contributing to Shiv's education fund. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with you not being overly involved in Shiv's life up to this point. Teen pregnancies are always difficult, Lindsay should be happy you want to help her daughter in this way. I'm not really close to my extended family, mainly due to distance, but I wish I had shared passions with some of them. Denying Shiv this bond with you is petty.", "NTA but there is clearly more on her mind than riding lessons.", "NTA, \n\nYou showed decency in offering it instead of buying lessons without asking. So you quite literally didn't overstep in any way.\n\nThe stepsister has some issues to work on. I hope she does. So she doesn't take genuine acts of kindness as an insult to her character or capabilities.", "NTA.", "NAH\n\nYou didn't know she harbored those feelings all these years and you didn't know you'd have this little bit of a connection to your niece until she contacted you. \n\nThere's nothing you can do about the past, whether or not knowing her feelings back then would have changed anything. But you're offering this now, not to gain favor to your niece, but because you saw the true interest and potential she has in something you are also passionate about. You have the means to help her circumstances so that she can continue the interest", "NTA at all, Lindsey obviously has a lot of resentment there from how she was treated when she became pregnant and how she struggled though.", "I'm between ESH and NAH, I get you are trying to do a good thing now. But you did bail when your sister got in trouble and you haven't shown her kid any interest in the first 10 years of her life. So I get where sis is coming from. But beggars can't be choosers and it would massively hurt her (relationship with her) kid if she declined your gift. \n\nIf you're willing to tell Shiv that you and her mom discussed the horse riding and have found a way to make it work (and never explicitly say to her that you paid for it all) that might bring all of you a little closer. But I can understand your sister's frustration with you swooping in now to be 'the cool rich aunt.'", "NTA. Do it anyway if you can because it will mean the world to Shiv and you're paying forward the joy you got.. Write that to Lindsay and tell her stop punishing.Shiv because she's jealous  She's blocking a rare opportunity for her daughter. Tell her imagine what happens when Shiv finds out, and she will. \n\nArrange it directly with the riding school if you can, ie if she doesn't turn up you don't pay. And give Shiv a card with it as a gift, say subject to your mum's approval. (LOL).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Lindsay's reaction is about her issues and not about your kind and generous offer. Since it makes her feel bad about herself to have you pay for lessons she can't afford, perhaps you can offer to pay for the lessons without Shiv or anyone else knowing you are doing it.", "NTA of course not. Maybe just give your parents the money and let it be \"from them\" so that your niece doesn't lose our on a great opportunity. And you may want to remind your step sister that you were also a kid when she was pregnant so WTF did she expect you to do?", "NTA. You are very kind and generous to offer to do this for your niece. As you are the same age as your step sister, you were not in a position to help when she was younger. \n\nStepsister is being petty. It is wrong of her to deny her daughter this wonderful opportunity because she is is jealous of the relationship you now have with her child.", "NTA. Stepsister should never have allowed your parents to purchase the first ten riding lessons if she had no intention of finding a way to let her continue lessons if she wanted to. Her mother is  lucky you stepped in.
