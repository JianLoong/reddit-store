It was a pretty hard time for Lindsay but also the whole family (parents almost got divorced over it, there was ex drama, etc.) and honestly no one\u2019s relationships were ever the same. \n\nI moved a couple of hours away and now live a couple of hours flight away from both Lindsay and our parents. I am not really big on kids, and Lindsay and I barely talk, so I didn\u2019t have much of a relationship with Shiv as she grew up, I\u2019d just show up to birthday dinners and bring gifts, and I contributed to an education fund my stepfather set up for her, but I never really knew her. \n\nEarlier this year, Shiv was doing a family tree project at school and I guess got interested in my mother\u2019s family, and started Googling everybody. According to my stepfather, she asked him a lot of questions about me and found my social media and found out I\u2019m big into horses, which she is, too. She messaged me (my stepfather asked if it was okay she contacted me) and now we talk regularly. She\u2019s a nice kid, as kids go.\n\nWhen she came to visit me with the parents over the summer, we went riding almost every day, and even though it was her first time doing it, she was a natural and she really loved it. Since then, she\u2019s been constantly talking about it and saying how much she misses it. My parents got her a block of ten riding group lessons as a gift (she\u2019s loving those) but they can\u2019t afford to support her in the sport long term. She has a real passion for horses and riding but Lindsay is basically a single mother and can\u2019t afford lessons for her long term either. \n\nI contacted Lindsay and offered to pay for Shiv\u2019s private riding lessons as long as she wants them. I said I would take responsibility for all the associated costs (equipment etc) even if she wants to compete. It\u2019s not a huge amount for me and I was lucky enough to have parents, partly my stepdad as well, supporting my passions my whole life so why wouldn\u2019t I want to help Shiv? \n\nLindsay went OFF at me. She said so many things I won\u2019t even type but she accused me of throwing money around to buy her daughter\u2019s affection and humiliate her. She said I shouldn\u2019t make her choose between taking an opportunity away from her daughter or feeling like dirt compared to me \u201clike always\u201d because I steal everything from her. She also said it was wrong of me to not pay any attention to Shiv for all the years Lindsay struggled raising her and circle back now to be her favourite. \n\nTo me, none of that reflects the reasons I made the offer, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t overstep. So I\u2019m looking for some third party opinions. Was it wrong of me to bring it up?", "created_utc": 1695984344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16v88i7/aita_for_offering_to_pay_for_my_nieces_riding/", "score": 323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Great gesture.\n\nSS feels like you are trying to buy her daughter's affections.  Have you spoken to your SD and Mom about her reaction?", "NTA  \n\n\nShe's being petty, she made the decision to get pregnant when she couldn't support a child and now doesn't want help because it makes her feel she cant support her childs good fortunes (which she cant).  \n\n\nNo winning with a delusional person like that  \n\n\nAlso not to be mean, but why did she name her kid after a knife", "NTA. It's a wonderful thing that Shiv has someone in her life who's not only able but also willing to support her passion, and it's a shame that her mother is too blinded by her jealousy of you to see what a wonderful opportunity this is for Shiv. If possible, I would recommend you try to have a talk with Lindsay about your reasons for not being in Shiv's life until now and your reasons for wanting to support her interest in riding. Try to make it clear that this isn't about you or Lindsay, it's about supporting Shiv.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to do a nice thing and you went about it in a respectful way by asking Lindsay on the down-low. Sounds like she's insecure about you being better off than she is.", "NTA-this is the realities of life. Everything is always in the eye of the beholder. Lindsey\u2019s interpretation of the past 11 years is hers. Yours is yours. \n\nYou can now choose to respect Lindsey\u2019s decision, or you can choose to offer the funding through the grandpa since Lindsey appears to be already okay with that. If it were me, I would let Lindsey choose between the two, but you don\u2019t have to do that. You could decide for yourself.", "NTA. It is a super sweet offer for your niece.\n\nBut I see also your step sisters side. Most likly Shiv is talking non stop of how much fun it was with you and that the two of you get riding every day. And she wish she would meet you more often. This can hurt a mother who gave up everything to raise her child, who loves aunty now more than her.\n\nHopefully Lindsay will cool off in a few days and you might talk to her again about it. May argue that it will also help their relationship if Mommy is also taking her horse riding (? - althaugh you are paying, Lindsy still will be the person driving her daughter to the stables.", "A good parent would be happy to watch their kids participate in something that makes them happy. I don\u2019t get why your sis wants to take this away from her daughter. It\u2019s quite sad. She should put her ego aside and think what is best for Shiv.", "NTA. Shiv contacted you. Lindsay she should've told Shiv not to contact you if she has a problem with you and not allowed her to visit, at least not until she worked out her issues. I think it's kind that you're offering to pay for this and extremely generous that you're contributing to Shiv's education fund. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with you not being overly involved in Shiv's life up to this point. Teen pregnancies are always difficult, Lindsay should be happy you want to help her daughter in this way. I'm not really close to my extended family, mainly due to distance, but I wish I had shared passions with some of them. Denying Shiv this bond with you is petty.", "NTA but there is clearly more on her mind than riding lessons.", "NTA, \n\nYou showed decency in offering it instead of buying lessons without asking. So you quite literally didn't overstep in any way.\n\nThe stepsister has some issues to work on. I hope she does. So she doesn't take genuine acts of kindness as an insult to her character or capabilities.", "NTA.", "NAH\n\nYou didn't know she harbored those feelings all these years and you didn't know you'd have this little bit of a connection to your niece until she contacted you. \n\nThere's nothing you can do about the past, whether or not knowing her feelings back then would have changed anything. But you're offering this now, not to gain favor to your niece, but because you saw the true interest and potential she has in something you are also passionate about. You have the means to help her circumstances so that she can continue the interest", "NTA at all, Lindsey obviously has a lot of resentment there from how she was treated when she became pregnant and how she struggled though.", "I'm between ESH and NAH, I get you are trying to do a good thing now. But you did bail when your sister got in trouble and you haven't shown her kid any interest in the first 10 years of her life. So I get where sis is coming from. But beggars can't be choosers and it would massively hurt her (relationship with her) kid if she declined your gift. \n\nIf you're willing to tell Shiv that you and her mom discussed the horse riding and have found a way to make it work (and never explicitly say to her that you paid for it all) that might bring all of you a little closer. But I can understand your sister's frustration with you swooping in now to be 'the cool rich aunt.'", "NTA. Do it anyway if you can because it will mean the world to Shiv and you're paying forward the joy you got.. Write that to Lindsay and tell her stop punishing.Shiv because she's jealous  She's blocking a rare opportunity for her daughter. Tell her imagine what happens when Shiv finds out, and she will. \n\nArrange it directly with the riding school if you can, ie if she doesn't turn up you don't pay. And give Shiv a card with it as a gift, say subject to your mum's approval. (LOL).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Lindsay's reaction is about her issues and not about your kind and generous offer. Since it makes her feel bad about herself to have you pay for lessons she can't afford, perhaps you can offer to pay for the lessons without Shiv or anyone else knowing you are doing it.", "NTA of course not. Maybe just give your parents the money and let it be \"from them\" so that your niece doesn't lose our on a great opportunity. And you may want to remind your step sister that you were also a kid when she was pregnant so WTF did she expect you to do?", "NTA. You are very kind and generous to offer to do this for your niece. As you are the same age as your step sister, you were not in a position to help when she was younger. \n\nStepsister is being petty. It is wrong of her to deny her daughter this wonderful opportunity because she is is jealous of the relationship you now have with her child.", "NTA. Stepsister should never have allowed your parents to purchase the first ten riding lessons if she had no intention of finding a way to let her continue lessons if she wanted to.

To turn down your offer and discontinue lessons for Shiv would be downright mean at this point.", "It\u2019s a nickname for Siobhan lol not her full name", "I know there are others with that name, but Shiv makes me automatically think of Succession.", "That makes more sense haha", "In India - Shiv is the name of a major Male God.", "Isnt that Shiva?", "This is NOT about your niece. This is about Lindsay being angry at you for something else.\n\n Probably for not being there as emotional support during her pregnancy and the early years. My guess is that she got compared to you a lot as well during those rocky years. \n\nNone of that stuff is your fault unless you were critical of her too. It sounds like you just headed for the exit about the time it started. I don't blame you for not wanting to be in the middle.\n\nMaybe it's time to try to talk all that history out and make amends for it. It doesn't sound like you have done anything actually wrong here though.", "NTA, but it seems like you unintentionally hit a major sore spot. \n\nIf you want to be sure your niece gets the lessons (which should be everyone\u2019s priority, but sadly her mom is letting her resentment get in the way right now), you could maybe swallow your pride and offer to let your parents take credit for the lessons. \n\nTo be clear, DO NOT do this behind your sister\u2019s back \u2014 that will make matters worse when she inevitably finds out. Tell her directly, something along the lines of: \u201cI clearly opened up an old wound, and that wasn\u2019t my intention. I\u2019m not trying to buy your kid\u2019s affection, and I don\u2019t need credit or attention \u2014 I just want to make it possible for her to do this thing that we both know she\u2019s going to be great at. You can tell her whatever you want about where the money came from, but my offer stands.\u201d\n\n(This is still kicking the truth can down the road a ways, but by the time your niece finds out who actually paid for the lessons, hopefully everyone will be a little bit better able to handle their big feelings.)", "NTA your sister sounds jealous that you can afford this for her daughter and she can't. You tried, I guess, but maybe it's time to back off.", "NTA, lindsay is the only person creating that dichotomy here.", "Absolutely not, she has some deep emotional baggage to unload but none of that is your fault.  So often we look for blame in others.  It\u2019s an amazing offer and I would do what I could to make it happen.  Shiv shouldn\u2019t have to do without, and what kid doesn\u2019t like the cool aunt/uncle over parents anyway?  Influence that girls life as much as you can, our kids need us more than ever now. You are not the issue here.", "NTA. It is in no way wrong of you to offer. It sounds like Lindsay has a lot going on and a lot of resentment build up, likely due to her having a child young and due to this not having the same type of opportunities that you, being childless did. She is wrong for blaming you, and hope she can realize that her jealously of your situation should not impact her daughter's ability to follow her passion. You are being very generous. As to her saying 'where have you been'-where has she been? Not facilitating a relationship with her stepsister, clearly.", "NTA\n\nYour stepsister is clearly jealous of you.\n\nIt's a shame she cannot just accept your gift for what it is. A great opportunity for her daughter. \n\nYou even went through her to make the offer.", "It was a kind and thoughtful offer.  NTA", "NTA. I initially assumed that you\u2019d offer to pay for lessons in front of your niece, essentially either forcing mom to agree or set her up to be the bad guy. But, sounds like you did this in a well-intentioned, thoughtful way and your sister is likely upset/feels bad she can\u2019t afford to do this for her own daughter. Maybe try to sit down with her and talk it over if you can. Hopefully you can patch things up and try to explain things from your perspective.", "NTA\n\nYou even contacted your sister to discuss the offer without talking to your niece about it yet. I think what you did was very nice and you did it the correct way.", "NTA This is just another version of \u201cwe don\u2019t take charity\u201d. My Mom missed out on many opportunities because of my asshole step-grandfather.  It\u2019s about her ego, not the kid.", "NTA I think your stepsister said the quiet part out loud when talking to you. I feel empathy for her because we all have our insecurities and it can feel so frustrating to have past conflict or setbacks dictate the quality of your future when your mind just wants to move on and start over. But she should have quashed that and focused on reality - she doesn\u2019t have the resources to fund this hobby. And while it probably feels bad to have to hold your hand out to someone who you feel some resentment for, you\u2019ve kindly offered her daughter a valuable and enjoyable opportunity.", "The uninvolved rich uncle (or aunt, in your case) is one of the most fun family members you can have.  Mine gave me $5000 on my 20th birthday because he was under the impression that it was my 21st.  He did not successfully buy my affection, FYI, nor was he trying to, but I always appreciated him.  As did my parents.\n\nYou're NTA.  You were also 17 when your stepsis got pregnant, it's hard to see how much help you could have given her at that point.", "NTA- but I would take a step back.\n\n\u201c She said I shouldn\u2019t make her choose between taking an opportunity away from her daughter or feeling like dirt compared to me \u201clike always\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s clearly some deep resentment/ jealousy going on with your step sister.  And it\u2019s only a matter of time before she starts lashing  out at your niece for wanting to spend more time with you.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame your niece  has to miss out a good thing because her mom is too selfish to allow it.", " NTA\nSo, your stepsister can't handle the fact that you want to gift a wonderful opportunity to your niece.... how sad for everyone.", "NTA \n\nYour step sister has unresolved issues and she is AH. She is hurting her daughter just to get back to you! \n\nThere is really nothing you can do but try to have a sit down with your step sister. \n\nShe is her mother and you will never replace nor would you want to do she might benefit from getting into therapy for her resentment and jealousy towards you. \n\nI would just mention to your stepdad that if the Bruce ever wants a lesson you are interested in paying for the lessons and equipments. Don\u2019t yet mention what your step sister has said", "It seems like Lindsay has some hidden insecurities about not being able to afford the lessons and so she's taking it out on you, who can afford them. Because what kind of person actually gets angry at someone for bonding with family more than they ever have before? It's not like you started bonding with her with a whole plan to start paying for everything just for the purpose of rubbing it in Lindsay's face.... It was a nice offer in the moment. NTA. Lindsay needs help if you ask me.", "NTA. You made a very sweet offer so that your niece could continue to take riding lessons. Your sister's reaction is bizarre and shows a lot about her insecurities.", "ESH.  11 is a bit young but it's probably not out of the realm that Shiv is trying to spread her fledgling adult wings in her relationship with her Mom. You did the right thing and asked, but what you proposed perhaps came across a bit Marie Antoinnette. Her Mom has struggled to buy her Daughter's bread but Auntie parachutes in and declares to let her eat cake if she lacks bread.\n\nSound like your sister could have used your help but got a heaping helping of judgement instead. If you really want a relationship with your niece AND  your sister...because they are a package deal...I suggest an apology followed by a genuine ask of if there is something they both need that you could help with instead.  At 28 with a rough start your sister might still be finding her feet.  For example, she might need a decent car to even GET niece to an event, never mind the stigma of dropping daughter off in a line of BMW's and Mercedes for her dressage lesson in her twenty year old minivan.", "Lindsay is seeing things colored through her own rage colored glasses. OP's offer was sincere and generous. NTA", "op=nta (as presented).\n\nThat said, maybe offer to supplement parent's support so that they get the credit?\n\nLindsay likely has a lot of insecurities about being a single mom, so tho she definitely sucks here with the attack--offer her grace if it doesn't emotionally harm you.", "NTA", "NTA.

The cool aunts and uncles always win over the parents so the mom needs to stand down and get some Therapy", "Tbh I doubt it\u2019s really about the lessons. Mum got pregnant and 17 and almost destroyed the family and has struggled away since. She will always have felt compared to and not as good as OP. Especially if OP has this much disposable income. She might have somewhat made peace about that. But now she has likely been hearing from Shiv all about how fantastic OP is and how much she enjoyed riding with her, and wasn\u2019t her house so cool etc etc etc. She\u2019s probably thinking \u201cit will calm down she\u2019ll forget\u201d then OP offered the lessons and if she accepts then that\u2019s it OP will be a favourite aunt forever and it won\u2019t blow over. If she rejects she knows deep down she did the wrong thing by her daughter. And she\u2019s taking it out on OP.\n\nTo be clear I think OP NTA and her sister is already an AH for being a dick to OP and will be a huge AH if she declines. Either way - as ever a little therapy sounds like a good plan.", "NTA", "Talking on an on about her aunt doesn\u2019t means she loves her more than her mom.

It bends the truth a little but allows Shiv to be grateful to both her mom and OP. It also makes sense, as OP is plugged into tuis world and she isn't. They don't have to make it complicated", "Step sister also has a lot of resentment for being held back/stunted for raising a child. And we don't know if the parents make comments on OPs achievements and it feels belittling to Ss. \n\nOP could of course apologize and ask step sister if they could do it anonymously. But it's really sad to see Mom's pride get in the way of something her daughter would enjoy.", "Trevena\\_Ice probably meant that from mom's perspective. Like \"Oh great my kid loves my sister more than me now\" might be running through mom's head. It's an insecurity mom needs to work through but not an uncommon one among parents who feel like they can't give their kids the kind of life they want to give. \n\nHopefully Shiv isn't being cruel as some kids can be. There has been times when kids have said stuff they don't truly mean like I wish \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ was my mom instead of you!

NTA", ">To me, none of that reflects the reasons I made the offer, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t overstep.\n\nThank you. SO MANY responses here conflating NAH/NTA with \"am I justified/correct?\"", "if she doesn't turn up you don't pay.\n\nStables  don't work that way.  Money is made from lessons as keeping horses is expensive.\nI could cancel with 24 hours so instructor  could call another student to fill the spot.\nIf rider was sick, or bad weather, then lesson could be made up within a few weeks.\n\nIf I didn't show up, I still paid  for that day", "All of this, 100%. \n\nThe stepsister is an AH, but she's in a crappy position where she cannot ever \"win.\" The worst part for her is that she isn't actually in a competition; she just can't feel help but feel like she is.\n\nHer response to and treatment of OP is totally unfair, but I find it very understandable. That doesn't lessen her AH status, though.", "This still doesn\u2019t make sense if you don\u2019t know that\u2019s pronounced shivaun", "Obvs i wouldn't have suggested it otherwise. Things are almost always open to negotiation somehow. She has no way of knowing the mum won't block Shiv from turning up. So not even trying definitely means no lessons which would be very sad for Shiv", "Every smart kid can distinguish their mother from their auntie.   \nI loved my parents.  \nI've had my favourite auntie(s).   \nI understood perfectly well that there is different dynamics in those two relationships and never expected my parents to behave and \"spoil me\" like my aunties.   \nOP is NTA, but SS is not thinking reasonable."]}
