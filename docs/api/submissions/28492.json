Her parents, should have been watching her like a hawk after the first time. If you were watching your niece while her parents went to the lake (that part of your post is a little unclear) you should have had eyes on her at all times. You shouldn\u2019t have yelled at your niece either, but comparatively, that was one of the smaller mistakes an adult made that day.\n\nYou all screwed up and are very lucky your niece is safe.

And had she gotten hurt, along with your guilt over that you would be responsible for her medical bills. \n\nAnd you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at the kid. She is 4. She doesn\u2019t understand the danger. You didn\u2019t have it blocked off from her so she went where she could. I understand fear and adrenaline, but you are an adult. Control yourself. \n\nAnd her parents should have been parenting her and making sure she didn\u2019t go out there when your idiot ass didn\u2019t properly block it off.", "She sounds like a bona fide brat who enjoys pushing boundaries in order to get a spectacular reaction from an adult.  Your scream, under circumstances of her creation, was positively justified.", "how high is this deck??? When I hear deck I think of something maybe two feet off the ground max so the idea that this was life or death doesn\u2019t quite compute. Is a Canadian deck more like a high balcony? \n\nAnyway, mild ESH. Parents should\u2019ve been more involved/on it, but screaming isn\u2019t a good response (although probably not a super thought out one, either, so no great blame on you). Where you\u2019re really the AH is not childproofing\u2014she got out TWELVE times and instead of stopping to come up with a system that would prevent it, you kept going with the party (this applies to the parents as well, not just you). Verbally telling a 4 year old \u201cthat super fun place isn\u2019t safe for you\u201d isn\u2019t gonna work and you\u2019re goofy for acting like it should have. \n\nUltimately it seems like your intentions overall were good but you\u2019re still TA and so is everyone here. Don\u2019t let kids play in dangerous places.", "How high is this deck?\n\nAlso, there are certain personality types where when a person is told No, they become infinitely curious and obsessed by the thought and have little impulse control. Now, transfer that to a four year old child whose impulse control and risk assessment is not fully formed. If she kept going for it over and over again, she obviously is in obsession mode. Yet she\u2019s also 4, not two. The best parents/teachers are those that can see who the child is, and interact with the child in a way that promotes proper development and safety. In your niece\u2019s case, the best way to deal with her after the second time, would likely have to gotten down to her level. Acknowledge and verbalize her curiosity. Ask her what she is curious about. Explain that the deck is not finished and therefor not safe to hang out on. Then I\u2019d offer to give her a special construction tour, just the two of us, but again explain that it\u2019s not safe, and she had to promise not to go out there without you. she needs to hold your hand and wear her safety gear. Make it fun and make her feel special. Put an empty pot on her head like a hard hat and take her out there to see it. Look over the edge. Explain what could happen if someone falls. Fill her curiosity bucket. Take the mystery out of it. Then as you go in, again make her promise not to go out there.", "YTA  \n\n\nShe's 4 ffs  \n\n\nWhat the hell would you think if a 20ft giant started screaming something unintelligible at you and started charging you? You think you might be a little afraid?   \nHow about if you could only understand maybe a 10th of what you understand now?   \nStarting to see how your the AH?  Just lock the door to the deck next time", "Still trying to understand why you celebrated Thanksgiving in October?\n\nNone of you are AH as I could see it was a mistake all the way around. Four year Olds are curious and don't tend to listen - even to their parents as their attention span is short and memories even shorter when told something. Parents probably did their best to watch her, but it's a family function and kids tend to wonder off, and you yelling, while it is a natural reaction, havent figured out that it's the wrong reaction and more likely to cause a kid to fall.\n\nI think you can chalk this up to one of those funny family jokes you tell in 10 years where you tell everyone what great escape artist she is. In the mean time, apologize for your reaction and just move on.I say later on since it was scary now, it will be funny later.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
