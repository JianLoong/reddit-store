I kind of snapped, I guess. My husband and I have 2 daughters. 12yo Hailie, my step daughter and 2 month old Hannah. Since I gave birth and up until about 2 weeks ago, I couldn't keep down any food outside of crackers. It would just make me sick, which the doctors said was because of me adjusting to breastfeeding and that it was normal. So up until 2 weeks ago, every single hot meal I made was eaten 100% by Hailie and my husband, though I still made myself a portion just in case. Hailie always ate my portion before leaving the table. She would see it set out on a plate for me, that I would try picking at, but as soon as she touched it I would stop picking at it and she would just take over. I spoke to her about it a few times because I won't eat anything that another person has touched. It grosses me out. So, she knew. She just didn't care to stop because \"it's not like you're going to eat it anyways\". My husband has spoken up to her several times and ultimately told me that I just wasn't making enough food because Hailie was still \"starving\" after eating her plate and second helpings. \n\nWhen I was finally able to keep food down again, I started making more dinner to combat the issue. Like I made a big sheet pan of lasagna. Definitely should have been left overs. But my husband had 2 helpings and the rest went to Hailie because right after I made dinner, the baby was fussy and tired and ultimately needed to be fed so I excused myself to the other room and when I came back a half hour later, Hailie was forking the last portion out of the pan- using her fingers. So, she touched it- I wouldn't eat it. Or last night, I made 5 medium sized chicken breasts. My husband had 2, Hailie had 2 and I had 1 on my plate. I was eating it slowly, so I wouldn't get sick. Hailie ate her entire plate and then said \"you gonna eat that?\" And put her finger directly on my chicken. My husband sent her to her room but ultimately, I didn't eat it. She knew what she was doing. Then tonight.. I made 5 cheese burgers for them (I cant eat hamburger) and 2 hot dogs for myself. Again, I ended up having to feed the baby directly after finishing dinner. They had eaten by the time I was finished feeding the baby. I make myself up my 2 hotdogs and Hailie reaches over and picks up the hotdog, bun and all, and flips it over, puts it back down and says \"was just checking if the bread was moldy\" and then looks up and sees me glaring at her and says \"oops, sorry, forgot. Guess you're not gonna eat that now so I can have it if you want\". I took my entire dinner, plate and all, and chucked it in the trash can and walked off. She starts crying to my husband about not meaning to upset me and that she was just hungry. My husband yelled at me for being childish and wasting food and left with his daughter. He said \"yeah I get that it's fucking annoying and I reprimand her every single fucking time but you didn't have to stoop to her fucking level. You're more childish than she is.\"\n\nETA: it's not just with dinner that this happens. Even when I was eating nothing but crackers, she would still ask me for my food. She eats multiple snacks during the day, as well as big breakfasts and lunches. She's been to a nutritionist and she's healthy. She has a high metabolism and just constantly wants food- as well as bored eats. Never gains a pound though. She's 5'2, 86lbs. (I messed up and wrote 72lbs in the comments because I was reading the wrong pediatrician visit). She's not overweight. She barely gains anything.", "created_utc": 1701749139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18b3bkf/aita_for_throwing_my_food_in_the_garbage_instead/", "score": 1576, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's the biggest problem here.", "NTA but your husband and stepdaughter are. She sounds troubled in some way. At 12 she should understand what she is doing and able to control it so to my mind she is touching your food to provoke you.

Is she jealous of the new baby?", "NTA.\n\nShe's not going to change. And your husband isn't doing good parenting. \n\nSo you have to adapt and change.\n\nStop sitting where she can do this to your food. Stop fixing her plate, make her do it herself. Change up how dinner is served. Put hers somewhere else while the adults eat at the table. Change up your schedule, eat when she's not there or eat at different times than when she does. Figure out what foods she hates and fix them. If she starts to reach out toward your food, yell at her as loud as you can \"NO!!!!\" and squirt her with a squirt gun. Treat her like the little unmannered feral child she is.\n\nJust don't sit there and be a victim of this, show this girl that you are in control, you're the adult and she's a child.", "NTA- \n\nThis is getting out of control. The idea that she gets rewarded with a plate of food every time she sticks her fingers in your food is part of the problem.... Because ultimately she continues to get what she wants out of the interaction... She both ensures you don't eat (for whatever reason she's touching your food not your husband's) and she gets to eat it in front of you...\n\n The reprimand does nothing if it only follows or is followed by a reward. \n\nThe fact that your husband allows this to happen in front of him does nothing is a problem. He doesn't offer up any meal and he doesn't replace the meal you lose every single night. When she's done with her plate she can leave the table. She doesn't need to sit there and watch you eat or touch your plate ever... And the second she reaches for your plate it's time for her to leave the table. And if the baby is fussy he needs to be getting up to deal with the baby while you eat your meal because that seems to be exactly enough of a delay for her to go for your plate. See how he handles her going for his plate. \n\nStart off the dinner with a reminder of the expectations. \"You can eat what's on your plate but you cannot touch anyone else's plate. If you do.

Your husband has to deal with his daughter. She complained there wasn't enough food, you made enough food for an army, and she still ate everything she could, and ruined (for you) what she couldn't.

He doesn't eat until you do. You eat first. The baby fusses? He deals with the fussy baby for the 10 minutes it takes you to eat. Hailie touches your food? Excellent, he can eat the gross kid hand food, and you can start the new portion. Even better, Hailie *also* has to wait.\n\nOr go on strike, let them cook their own food.\n\nETA: there's been some discussion over food scarcity vs power play. So it's test time.

You need to consistently provide more.\n\n2) If Hailie eats until she makes herself sick, you have a deeper food problem, either developed from scarcity, jealously, or some other physical/mental/psychological issue. Talk to her doctor.\n\n3) If Hailie *still* puts her fingers in the food, either in yours specifically, or in the whole meals worth, then you've got a power play, but you could still also have a problem with quantity. 1 and 2 are still important here, but you know she's acting out.", "Let your husband cook for Hailie and her gargantuan appetite.", "Stop cooking for them!

Best of luck to you all.", "NTA but it's not about the food, she's only doing this while you're nursing. This is about the new baby and jealousy. By taking food away from you she's taking it away from the baby.", "NTA. Your husband is a twit. But also, you teach people how to treat you. You need to have a frank discussion as to why she is being such a cow (obs, it\u2019s the new baby who is your top priority right now and your \u201creal\u201d daughter, in her mind) and let her know you care about her, feelings of insecurity are normal\u2014BUT, that you won\u2019t accept being treated like that.", "NTA Wow. Hailie should be sitting well away from you at the table. Then she can't just reach over and touch your food. Good for you for standing up for yourself. You know that in addition to a step daughter issue, you also have a husband issue. He should be standing up for you. You have a new baby. You are tired, exhausted and now just starting to eat again. I'm surprised your can produce enough milk to feed the baby if you aren't eating very much. Maybe just eat before everyone else does. You really need to work this out with hubs.

I feel stupid. I kind of snapped, I guess. My husband and I have 2 daughters. 12yo Hailie, my step daughter and 2 month old Hannah. Since I gave birth and up until about 2 weeks ago, I couldn't keep down any food outside of crackers. It would just make me sick, which the doctors said was because of me adjusting to breastfeeding and that it was normal. So up until 2 weeks ago, every single hot meal I made was eaten 100% by Hailie and my husband, though I still made myself a portion just in case. Hailie always ate my portion before leaving the table. She would see it set out on a plate for me, that I would try picking at, but as soon as she touched it I would stop picking at it and she would just take over. I spoke to her about it a few times because I won't eat anything that another person has touched. It grosses me out. So, she knew. She just didn't care to stop because \"it's not like you're going to eat it anyways\". My husband has spoken up to her several times and ultimately told me that I just wasn't making enough food because Hailie was still \"starving\" after eating her plate and second helpings. \n\nWhen I was finally able to keep food down again, I started making more dinner to combat the issue. Like I made a 8x10 sheet pan of lasagna. Definitely should have been left overs. But my husband had 2 helpings and the rest went to Hailie because right after I made dinner, the baby was fussy and tired and ultimately needed to be fed so I excused myself to the other room and when I came back a half hour later, Hailie was forking the last portion out of the pan- using her fingers. So, she touched it- I wouldn't eat it. Or last night, I made 5 medium sized chicken breasts. My husband had 2, Hailie had 2 and I had 1 on my plate. I was eating it slowly, so I wouldn't get sick. Hailie ate her entire plate and then said \"you gonna eat that?\" And put her finger directly on my chicken. My husband sent her to her room but ultimately, I didn't eat it. She knew what she was doing. Then tonight.. I made 5 cheese burgers then (I cant eat hamburger) and 2 hot dogs for myself. Again, I ended up having to feed the baby directly after finishing dinner. They had eaten by the time I was finished feeding the baby. I make myself up my 2 hotdogs and Hailie reaches over and picks up the hotdog, bun and all, and flips it over, puts it back down and says \"was just checking if the bread was moldy\" and then looks up and sees me glaring at her and says \"oops, sorry, forgot.

I can\u2019t believe she keeps taking your portion and/or contaminating it by touching it.", "NTA - This is very, very concerning, both from everything dealing with your stepdaughter and the lack of support and real effort from your husband.

There is no excuse for his lack of involvement with the baby, taking care of the home, and being a supportive husband in all ways, but particularly during this postpartum period. \n\nYou also need food! It may feel isolating, but you should make your plate of food and take it with you to the other room if you have to do things for the baby when dinner is ready. That way you definitely get your portion, and you can eat what you can in peace without worrying about Hailie being a brat by purposefully sabotaging and stealing your food.

Then keep disposing of it every time. Order yourself something nice.\n\nWhile lots of people have said eat somewhere else, this isn't going to make the situation better, nor should you be forced to eat elsewhere. \n\nIs she also drinking enough water? Sometimes the feeling of hunger could also be the need for hydration, so if you don't already get a jug of water at the table and actively encourage drinking some water.  It also takes some time for the body to register that it's full and no longer hungry. Perhaps instead of giving two portions give one, with lots of vegetables and such with it, so that it will take longer to eat the typical portion that you give her because she has to get up to retrieve it.\n\nETA: also get yourself a breastfeeding wrap, that can hold your baby, allowing you to have your hands free. That way you can eat with everyone.\n\nOf course I need to add the petty option... Take a fork out of everyone's plate and if anyone makes a comment, look stepdaughter in the eyes and say that she's happy touching and eating off your plate, you dint think it was an issue that you'd eat of theirs", "Easy solved- you husband doesn\u2019t touch a single slither of food until you have eaten. He doesn\u2019t get seconds until he has feed his wife first and his daughter second. Then he can go hungry if she plays these games.", "NTA. I have read A LOT of your comments and honestly I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re safe. There are a lot of red flags. \n\n1. Your husband asked you to quit your job and once you did he started treating you differently. \n2. Lack of boundaries from not only your SD but also your husband. \n3. Your friends won\u2019t go to your home and you\u2019ve had to distance yourself. That screams suspicious. I would talk to them about that. \n4. Your SD attention seeking is not normal at all. \n5. Your husband pulled SD from therapy before the therapist recommended it. \n6. You are two months postpartum and you\u2019re the one doing all the cooking/cleaning PLUS doing all the caring for the baby. You husband is not a partner to you AT ALL. \n7. You are not able to eat. Your husband may get \u201cmad\u201d at his daughter for what she does but he is not doing anything to change her behaviour. She needs to be disciplined to the point she will actually think twice about it. You are breastfeeding and NEED to eat \n8. The way your SD talks to your baby is scary. I would NOT leave her alone with that baby. Telling a baby that they stole her parents should have gotten her right back into therapy. That is an indicator she is a danger to your daughter. Her attention seeking is not just a normal child looking for attention. \n9. Your husband WONT cook for himself or his daughter until it is simply too late. That is unacceptable honestly. You are not a maid for them. You are not in that house to wait on them hand and foot, to clean and cook whenever they want. \n10. The friends who you have confided in have told you it is the postpartum clarity. Clearly they HAVE seen red flags around your home life before your baby was born and now they are just watching you also see them now that your rose coloured glasses are off. \n\nYou should talk with your therapist about what is going on at home. If you have friends or family who you can stay with I would suggest packing yourself and daughter up and leaving at least for a few days. And tell your husband every reason I listed above. You are not doing well. You are being deprived food. Deprived sleep. You are burnt out even saying so yourself. You are a new mom doing the best she can and you NEED help. The ONLY thing you should be concerned about right now is your daughter not cooking, cleaning, fighting with your husband, your SD\u2019s issues. It needs to change for this to be a sustainable living condition for yourself and daughter. \n\nI am very sorry you\u2019re going through this and that you don\u2019t get to just focus on your new baby. It must be SO overwhelming I can\u2019t even begin to imagine. But remember, you are her mom and at the end of the day you will always do what is best for her even if it is hard. You got this. You are strong and you are deserving of a partnership that is actually a partnership.

I struggled with food while pregnant and still with breastfeeding, hormones are whack. Eat when you need to and only when you need to. I ate at weird hours that early in and often made a meal for my spouse later. Or couldn\u2019t stand dinner, but was making a feast at midnight. Breastfeeding on demand makes weird schedules. Don\u2019t feel guilty for making two dinners if it\u2019s something you want. Or take your plate with you when you go care for little one. My babe has seen plenty of sauce dripped on their head while breastfeeding. I saw comments about your husband failing at making dinner. If it\u2019s his night to make it and 6pm rolls around, nothing. Tell Hailie to go talk to him instead of stepping in. \n\nMy therapist told me this week that setting boundaries when they\u2019ve been absent will have pushback as people adjust. Either they end up adjusting or you realize you don\u2019t need them in your life in that capacity. \n\nIn the postpartum clarity, I saw major issues in my marriage that I didn\u2019t see before, things my friends bit their tongue about. From a couple of your replies, I think you\u2019re feeling that way too. I asked my spouse to step up and make those changes because it was no longer acceptable. It took him hitting rock bottom a couple months ago, but those changes have been made. If he\u2019s not supporting you in ways he promised, don\u2019t be afraid to reevaluate the marriage. Change can happen and it\u2019s slow, but don\u2019t get complacent with waiting. \n\nDo you want your child in a marriage like the one you\u2019re in someday? If the answer is no, ensure change is made with his support or by divorce papers. \n\nMaybe I\u2019m the asshole for this statement: but having a newborn gives you some permission to be a tiny bit selfish. You\u2019re sustaining life with your body. It takes a toll in ways you never expected (like holy cow I have way more cavities now bc of pregnancy lol). But these weren\u2019t selfish actions.

Bc rn it\u2019s sounding like either she\u2019s punishing you for paying attention to the baby (she might think you feeding the baby = giving baby more attention than the baby deserves) by taking away your food OR if she knows you need to eat to feed the baby, she\u2019s punishing the baby by taking away your food so you can\u2019t feed them anymore.\n\nShe knows your struggle with food.

A growing girl who\u2019s burning through her meals like crazy isn\u2019t going to be satiated with some measly crackers.\n\nIt\u2019s not the food.

Which is just modeling the behavior he\u2019s doing. \n\nA GOOD husband would be stepping up and taking care of all of this while you are postpartum - especially after you needed to go to therapy right after birth. \n\nYour husband is not a keeper. Do not stay in this relationship unless and until he does a lot of work on himself and also decides to be a parent. \n\nYou deserve better. This is not healthy. And you will feel a lot better when you get away from them.", "(NTA) So there could still be something going on - eating disorder, tapeworm, thyroid issues? And I think it's a good idea to investigate these. But to be fair, teens who do sports, especially aerobic ones, can get absolutely ravenous. My husband was a stick who ate his parents out of house and home but had nothing wrong with him except martial arts :P\n\nI've got an almost 12yo. She will sometimes act out and do things she knows are wrong bc she's in a bad mood, didn't sleep well, is feeling restless and angry about it, whatever. But she's got enough of a conscience to realize she was out of line and get upset with herself for it and apologize and do something nice for them. Does your SD show any remorse that she is upsetting you? Does she say \"thank you\" for the food you make her, demonstrate other ways she appreciates your hard work? Show compassion for the hard time you're having after the birth? I feel like at this age most kids have developed enough empathy to show it. If you haven't, explain to her calmly but sincerely how this food issue is making you feel. How you love her and right now you're feeling unloved back, hurt and confused about why she's doing this to you when you've made it plain it upsets you. Ask her if there's something besides hunger going on, because if it's just about being hungry after dinner, there's no reason to take your portion, she can go get an apple, and everyone gets to eat properly. (Given what she said to the baby, I would not bring up that you need the calories for breastfeeding. Just make it about you needing to eat well-rounded meals for your health too.) Does everyone get enough to eat at bio-mom's house? Is she angry or sad about something? Feeling ignored or put aside (thus the remark to the baby)? If she's not willing to talk to you about it/you can't get on the same page, I would push again for therapy with her with your husband. And discreetly not let her be alone with the baby or hold her unsupervised (and listen for crying... this is extremely upsetting, but a jealous sibling might do something like covertly squeeze/pinch them, or even worse).\n\nAlso, idk why your husband isn't making meals (maybe he works extra long hours at a very demanding job?) or assisting enough at night with the baby for you to get more than 4 hrs sleep, but if you think he should be helping more, speak up. Taking care of the baby at night should be equally his responsibility, whether he has a job or not (whether you're a SAHM or not, you also have a FT job during the day, even if, like a real gem, he doesn't see it that way). I know, I know, if you're breastfeeding even help from the husband can amount to little at night. Something's gotta give, though. If you're usually the one to answer the baby at night because you've got the boobs, maybe he can at least change her, bring her to you, set you guys up, and you can drift off again while he stays awake and puts baby back in the bassinet when meal's done. Maybe you can pump and he can give at least one feeding at night. My own solution after months of sleep deprivation was DD and I on a firm twin mattress on the floor, wearing enough we didn't need blankets, pool noodle under the fitted sheet on her side so she didn't roll off, boobs out for free access; husband still got up when I called for a diaper etc., but mostly that allowed both of us to finally get 4 hours sleep straight plus another few after intermission.\n\nGood grief, being a new mother is hard. I miss them being little but I do not miss the exhaustion and other struggles. You're powering through in amazing fashion, but you need more support from your family... I'm rooting for you, mama!", "Does your husband make them uncomfortable?", "A surgery might not be necessary! You might just need to put less strain on the gallbladder for awhile.
