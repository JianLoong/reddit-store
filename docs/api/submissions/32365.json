{"id": 32365, "submission_id": "18b3bkf", "title": "AITA for throwing my food in the garbage instead of giving it to my daughter?", "selftext": "What I did was wrong. I feel stupid. I kind of snapped, I guess. My husband and I have 2 daughters. 12yo Hailie, my step daughter and 2 month old Hannah. Since I gave birth and up until about 2 weeks ago, I couldn't keep down any food outside of crackers. It would just make me sick, which the doctors said was because of me adjusting to breastfeeding and that it was normal. So up until 2 weeks ago, every single hot meal I made was eaten 100% by Hailie and my husband, though I still made myself a portion just in case. Hailie always ate my portion before leaving the table. She would see it set out on a plate for me, that I would try picking at, but as soon as she touched it I would stop picking at it and she would just take over. I spoke to her about it a few times because I won't eat anything that another person has touched. It grosses me out. So, she knew. She just didn't care to stop because \"it's not like you're going to eat it anyways\". My husband has spoken up to her several times and ultimately told me that I just wasn't making enough food because Hailie was still \"starving\" after eating her plate and second helpings. \n\nWhen I was finally able to keep food down again, I started making more dinner to combat the issue. Like I made a big sheet pan of lasagna. Definitely should have been left overs. But my husband had 2 helpings and the rest went to Hailie because right after I made dinner, the baby was fussy and tired and ultimately needed to be fed so I excused myself to the other room and when I came back a half hour later, Hailie was forking the last portion out of the pan- using her fingers. So, she touched it- I wouldn't eat it. Or last night, I made 5 medium sized chicken breasts. My husband had 2, Hailie had 2 and I had 1 on my plate. I was eating it slowly, so I wouldn't get sick. Hailie ate her entire plate and then said \"you gonna eat that?\" And put her finger directly on my chicken. My husband sent her to her room but ultimately, I didn't eat it. She knew what she was doing. Then tonight.. I made 5 cheese burgers for them (I cant eat hamburger) and 2 hot dogs for myself. Again, I ended up having to feed the baby directly after finishing dinner. They had eaten by the time I was finished feeding the baby. I make myself up my 2 hotdogs and Hailie reaches over and picks up the hotdog, bun and all, and flips it over, puts it back down and says \"was just checking if the bread was moldy\" and then looks up and sees me glaring at her and says \"oops, sorry, forgot. Guess you're not gonna eat that now so I can have it if you want\". I took my entire dinner, plate and all, and chucked it in the trash can and walked off. She starts crying to my husband about not meaning to upset me and that she was just hungry. My husband yelled at me for being childish and wasting food and left with his daughter. He said \"yeah I get that it's fucking annoying and I reprimand her every single fucking time but you didn't have to stoop to her fucking level. You're more childish than she is.\"\n\nETA: it's not just with dinner that this happens. Even when I was eating nothing but crackers, she would still ask me for my food. She eats multiple snacks during the day, as well as big breakfasts and lunches. She's been to a nutritionist and she's healthy. She has a high metabolism and just constantly wants food- as well as bored eats. Never gains a pound though. She's 5'2, 86lbs. (I messed up and wrote 72lbs in the comments because I was reading the wrong pediatrician visit). She's not overweight. She barely gains anything.", "created_utc": 1701749139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18b3bkf/aita_for_throwing_my_food_in_the_garbage_instead/", "score": 254, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's the biggest problem here.", "NTA but your husband and stepdaughter are. She sounds troubled in some way. At 12 she should understand what she is doing and able to control it so to my mind she is touching your food to provoke you.

The idea that she gets rewarded with a plate of food every time she sticks her fingers in your food is part of the problem.... Because ultimately she continues to get what she wants out of the interaction... She both ensures you don't eat (for whatever reason she's touching your food not your husband's) and she gets to eat it in front of you...\n\n The reprimand does nothing if it only follows or is followed by a reward. \n\nThe fact that your husband allows this to happen in front of him does nothing is a problem. He doesn't offer up any meal and he doesn't replace the meal you lose every single night. When she's done with her plate she can leave the table. She doesn't need to sit there and watch you eat or touch your plate ever... And the second she reaches for your plate it's time for her to leave the table. And if the baby is fussy he needs to be getting up to deal with the baby while you eat your meal because that seems to be exactly enough of a delay for her to go for your plate. See how he handles her going for his plate. \n\nStart off the dinner with a reminder of the expectations. \"You can eat what's on your plate but you cannot touch anyone else's plate. If you do.

Best of luck to you all.", "NTA but it's not about the food, she's only doing this while you're nursing. This is about the new baby and jealousy.

I feel stupid. I kind of snapped, I guess. My husband and I have 2 daughters. 12yo Hailie, my step daughter and 2 month old Hannah. Since I gave birth and up until about 2 weeks ago, I couldn't keep down any food outside of crackers. It would just make me sick, which the doctors said was because of me adjusting to breastfeeding and that it was normal. So up until 2 weeks ago, every single hot meal I made was eaten 100% by Hailie and my husband, though I still made myself a portion just in case. Hailie always ate my portion before leaving the table. She would see it set out on a plate for me, that I would try picking at, but as soon as she touched it I would stop picking at it and she would just take over. I spoke to her about it a few times because I won't eat anything that another person has touched. It grosses me out. So, she knew. She just didn't care to stop because \"it's not like you're going to eat it anyways\". My husband has spoken up to her several times and ultimately told me that I just wasn't making enough food because Hailie was still \"starving\" after eating her plate and second helpings. \n\nWhen I was finally able to keep food down again, I started making more dinner to combat the issue. Like I made a 8x10 sheet pan of lasagna. Definitely should have been left overs. But my husband had 2 helpings and the rest went to Hailie because right after I made dinner, the baby was fussy and tired and ultimately needed to be fed so I excused myself to the other room and when I came back a half hour later, Hailie was forking the last portion out of the pan- using her fingers. So, she touched it- I wouldn't eat it. Or last night, I made 5 medium sized chicken breasts. My husband had 2, Hailie had 2 and I had 1 on my plate. I was eating it slowly, so I wouldn't get sick. Hailie ate her entire plate and then said \"you gonna eat that?\" And put her finger directly on my chicken. My husband sent her to her room but ultimately, I didn't eat it. She knew what she was doing. Then tonight.. I made 5 cheese burgers then (I cant eat hamburger) and 2 hot dogs for myself. Again, I ended up having to feed the baby directly after finishing dinner. They had eaten by the time I was finished feeding the baby. I make myself up my 2 hotdogs and Hailie reaches over and picks up the hotdog, bun and all, and flips it over, puts it back down and says \"was just checking if the bread was moldy\" and then looks up and sees me glaring at her and says \"oops, sorry, forgot. Guess you're not gonna eat that now so I can have it if you want\". I took my entire dinner, plate and all, and chucked it in the trash can and walked off. She starts crying to my husband about not meaning to upset me and that she was just hungry. My husband yelled at me for being childish and wasting food and left with his daughter. He said \"yeah I get that it's fucking annoying and I reprimand her every single fucking time but you didn't have to stoop to her fucking level. You're more childish than she is.\"\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
