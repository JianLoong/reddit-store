You've told her you're not taking on this labor for her. Even when you DID wake her, she decided to go back to sleep. Dealing  with someone who snoozes multiple alarms is infuriating to me. It is so inconsiderate! I wouldn't have lasted this long.", "Same happened to me but we are more like sisters than friends. So when they overslept (and asked me to wake them up), i would do it in the most unhinged way possible. \n\nThrowing their covers and what not. Although this pissed then off for the moment but they did ask for it right? I suggests you do the same if she is blaming you for not waking her up. \n\n\nAlso, i always went to have breakfast alone and did not wait for them. They sleep they get starbucks \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.\n\nYour friend needs to GROW UP.  She won't wake up, but then blames YOU when she doesn't wake up.\n\nDo not wake her up any more.  She's an adult.  \n\nOR, wake her up tomorrow by throwing a glass of water on her.", "NTA. She is a grown ass adult and you tried. Sorry, friend. Grow up!", "NTA.  \nGetting this woman out of bed is not your problem. I can't believe that she's never been responsible for getting herself out of bed on time.   \nTime for her to either grow up or see a doctor to find out what's wrong with her.", "NTA. Once is fine, but every day? She's an adult, not a toddler, and you even warned her you're not doing it anymore.", "Not wanting to miss breakfast is great motivation for her to learn to get herself out of bed. No consequences = no improvement. I think it\u2019s awesome you implemented the boundary of not waking her up!", "NTA. NOPE...She is a 22 grown ass woman, she can't get up with an alarm like every other adult on the planet. If not, she can miss breakfast and be cranky, not your responsibility.", "No if she was hungry enough she would have been able to wake up. You\u2019re both adults. I\u2019m the responsible one too but I don\u2019t need to be someone\u2019s mom when they\u2019re an adult", "The friend could at least have the decency to decide whether she prefers sleep or breakfast.\n\nFor me, it's easy. I prefer sleep. I'll happily sleep right through breakfast and wake up in my own time, happy with that decision. Would I like to be the kind of person who wakes up early and enjoys a hearty breakfast? Especially an inclusive hotel buffet breakfast? Sure. But I quickly accepted that I am Not That Person.\n\nThis friend seems to hate waking up but also hate missing breakfast. Talk about making life inherently difficult for yourself.\n\nI've known people like this. People for whom every option, even binary opposite ones, is a trial that everyone needs to know about. \"I'd hate to go but I'd also hate to miss it\". \"I don't want to go out and I don't want to stay in\". \"I don't want to cook and I don't want to order a takeaway and I don't want to eat out\". \"I want to sleep in but I don't want to miss breakfast\". Shoot me. What a painful existence and even more painful to be around.", "Could also be the time changes, altitude changes plus general fatigue of traveling abroad. Sometimes it takes a while to get used to it all", "Sitting up doesn't always work. In the military (here at least) they do \"Feet on the floor\".\n\nIf you can get them to put their feet in the floor your ass is covered (the most important part) and they are MUCH more likely to wake up and STAY awake.", "Except that it's not OP's responsibility to get her friend up at all.", "It\u2019s ok to miss one meal.  Better than eating some junky pastry.", "i do something sorta similar, whatever i was watching/reading/playing before i went to bed usually somehow burns itself into my brain in such a way that it somehow ends up in my dream. I started playing Day Z (zombie-survival game) and I kept dreaming I was hovering over a fire eating deersteaks waiting for daylight. When I was on a mariokart tear i woke myself up once kicking my legs out cause someone had red shelled me in my dream. i woke up pissed lol.", "I used to dream that I woke up and got ready for school or work. It sucked so bad when I\u2019d wake up for real. \ud83d\ude02", "That's a fair comment.", "You\u2019re right. But it would be funny.", "You\u2019re right. But it would be funny.", "I just stayed in a hotel who's breakfast included portable things like fresh fruit and wrapped muffins. And they had little bags out in case you had to grab food to take with you. I thought that was so nice, you never see that.", "I hate the beeps, so I set my clock radio alarm for radio.  Usually it wakes me up, but there have been times I incorporated the song into my dream, either as \"soundtrack\" or as the storyline.", "I too would incorporate the sound of an alarm into my dreams. As a teenager I had a horrible time getting up in the mornings. I would usually set my alarm and it would go off for so long it would wake up one of my sisters in another room and they would come in and wake me up. Lol.", "That's so nice! I think more of them do that now since they had to adjust to a 'grab and go' breakfast instead of traditional during COVID, at least where I live.", "My dad falls asleep to a radio that has news and political talk pretty much non stop, and he says that sometimes in his dreams, right before he wakes up, he'll be arguing with whatever the host of the show was saying.", "I once incorporated firetruck sirens in my dream and didn't wake up until well after they had arrived (minor fire across the street).  It was the lights that finally woke me up.  The fire in my dream was way worse than the one  on my street.", "Yes your the asshole, why couldn't u bring her back a plate?", "Fuck no, NTA. Being awake when you need to be is one of the very basics of human adulthood. They need better alarm and some self discipline", "NTA and I say that as someone who struggles to get up in the morning. But it's my responsibility, no-one else's. (I guess that's my cue to put my phone down and go to sleep now!)", "You snooze, you lose!", "NTA. And I\u2019m the same way as your friend.", "NTA\n\nU don\u2019t have any responsibility to take care of her. She\u2019s going to have to figure it out sooner than later.\n\nThere are alarm bracelets that vibrate and other types of alarms she could get if the phone sound doesn\u2019t work.", "People who set multiple cascading alarms are at least partly, and maybe wholly, the cause of their own problems.  Just go to bed earlier.  If you go to bed at 12, set a series of alarms that start at 6 and keep interrupting your dozing til you finally get up at 7, you've ruined a hour of sleep you obviously desperately needed. Go to bed at 11 and set the alarm for 7, and you might even wake up before it goes off.", "Nta", "NTA.\n\nDid you know about this before you travelled with her and if you did was there any agreement before you booked anything that you would help her wake up?\n\nI'm assuming not and as a grown adult she needs to find something that works for her rather than shifting the burden onto others.", "NTA in even the slightest way. You\u2019re 22 and she\u2019s 22. Enjoy your vacation. Shit, when I sleep in and my wife wakes me up on vacation for hotel breakfast it\u2019s annoying. I\u2019ll grab a snack when we are out because it\u2019s my choice to sleep in. I\u2019d rather sleep than have breakfast. My choice. It\u2019s your friends choice too. Wake up earlier if you want hotel breakfast", "Does she have a medical problem that prevents her from waking up? how does she have a job? I love to sleep in and would honestly not want my friend to wake me up in that situation.", "NTA. She needs to grow up.", "NTA... tell her you wont be waking her from now on. \n\nI married young, and my husband expected me to wake him for work. I knew his boss, I warned him of what was going to happen and I asked him not to be gentle if he showed up late. \nHe was sent home from work twice ... then he learned. \n\nDont enable", "Maybe this is just me, but if a good friend asked me to do this I would yank all their covers off and drag them onto the floor every morning, and if that doesn't work, the hotel has an ice machine right?\n\nNTA for sure, she can organise her own breakfast, she's an adult.", "NTA. Part of becoming an adult is waking yourself up in the morning. You did the right thing in allowing her to experience the consequences of her choices. You did warn her. Just let her know that it just wasn't working for you to have to have that extra stress in the morning. Just calmly let her know that your limit is 1 wake up call a day.", "Have you ever had breakfast at a hotel?? You can't just bring back a plate to the room", "lol, I have done this with the old clock radio beep beep beep.  I\u2019ve done both dreamt it while it was going off and woken up thinking I heard it but I just dreamt it!", "I literally stayed in a hotel for 4 nights and brought my mother breakfast every morning"]}
