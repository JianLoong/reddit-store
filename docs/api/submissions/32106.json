It's not your fault she used you as an excuse to get out of going. Sorry about your loss. Was she your mother's mother?", "NTA. Your mum has to take responsibility for her own lies", "Nta", "NTA\n\nShe is a grown adult who made the conscious choice to lie because she couldn't just own her own choice of social occasion with friends vs family funeral.\n\nI hope the chemo well and truly achieves results and that you have many years of good health ahead (I'm 2.5 years post cancer myself).\n\nDoes she actually need a key to your place? If not, I'd just quietly change the locks. At least I would agree that if she can't talk civilly to you, she shouldn't be entering your home when you're not there.", "NTA. You want to attend your grandmother's funeral, so of course you should go. You have let you Mom know you are going so she isn't blindsided, and you gave her the opportunity to travel with you . If she choses not to, that's her decision. \n\nAlso, you don't actually need to expose her as lying - if anyone asks you you can say 'I think there was a bit of a communications mix up - Mom was worried I would struggle getting here' If anyone specifically brings up her saying  she couldn't go then I think you would be fine to say something to avoid you being made the bad guy, but keep it as bland as you can (e.g. 'oh no, I can't think why she'd say that, are you sure you didn't misunderstand? I  offered to travel with her, but I let her know that I was fine travelling by myself if she didn't feel up to coming - we don't live together , and this is her mum,(obviously leave that out of it is your father's mum!)  so of course it's entirely her decision about whether she felt able to come' ) (I think the framing about feeling able to come leave open the  interpretation that she might had stayed home for health reasons or becaue she finds funerals difficult, so it's not critical of her.", "Nta this is your mom\u2019s mom that passed away? you are expecting a woman who chose a meal with friends over attending her own mothers funeral to be logical? \n\nYour mom sounds selfish and toxic and you would do well to distance yourself from her", "NTA. change your locks.", "Thats the weird thing there, was no problems between them. The main problem my mum has that the funeral is arranged for when my niece is home from her honeymoon. We pointed out that there was no availability before then anyway, but she wont believe me.", "Thank you for your reply. This helps so much. \n\nI didnt attend my dads funeral as I was 18, also studying and living far away. (At 15 my mum moved us 200 miles away from the rest of my family). I didnt even know when it was. Also the last funeral I went to was the same day I was told what stage cancer I had and what treatment I needed. I sat there thinking I was next. I think this will break that cycle and fear knowing Im not next Ive beaten this.", "Thank you. Im in full remission and on frequent monitoring for the next 2 years. \n\nUnfortunately my only support locally was mum who visited 2 hours a fortnight to hoover half the house for me, and on treatment days she drove me to drop the kids at school then 5 minutes down the road to the bus stop. But on the positive side, I can see how strong I am, I got through this as a single mum more or less on my own. And it's brought me and my sisters closer", "She was my sisters dads mother. But she accepted me as a granddaughter the day I was born of her own choice, and treated me equally to my sisters. She was the closest of my grandparents I had.", "Thank you. Im in full remission now, just having frequent checks for 2 years.\n\n I will be thinking about changing the locks once I'm back from the funeral. I think it's the knowing she let herself in, especially when she know I was on the school run that brought up the feelings again.", "She was very open about telling everyone we weren't going because of me before I had even made a decision. Even to the point of telling people, my therapist said I shouldn't go, even though I hadn't seen a therapist at that point.

Oh wow.  Is this new behavior for your mom, or does she typically treat you like this?\n\nThe funny thing is, she didn't need to make an excuse.

She moved you 200 miles away from the family support system, barely did a damn thing while you were a single mom going through cancer treatments and now is mad because you want to go to a funeral she didn\u2019t want to go to and since she used you as her excuse not to go now she looks bad if she doesn\u2019t go? Is your mom a narcissist? Because she sounds like it. \n\nGirl live your life. Don\u2019t worry about your mother\u2019s wants or opinions. You don\u2019t need to consult her before booking train or hotel tickets. You find what works for you and then if you feel like it you say \u201cthis is when we are going and where we are staying. What are your travel plans?\u201d. Also change your door locks if you don\u2019t want her randomly coming into your house. This is your life, live it for yourself.", "Oh sure, but if you explicitly say she lied and used you as an excuse, you look bad. If you give her a plausible 'out' then either people will accept that and assume that wires got crossed and no one was lying or being unreasonable, or they will see that she was lying but tht you are trying to be diplomatic about it - either way you come out of it well since it's clear you are not  stirring things up more!"]}
