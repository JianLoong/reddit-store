Yes you chose to rile her up, but she was way out of line to begin with, and it was pretty funny, so I side with you.", "YTA - You escalated the situation like a child.", "NTA, she's being weird.\n\nNext move: apologize profusely and send her a \"copy\" of a key that doesn't open your door.

Beautifully done.", "NTA. \n\nMILs who can\u2019t respect boundaries are not ones you want to give house keys to. \n\nOn another note, why do so many of the AITA have husbands who get into giant arguments to protect their mothers?

That's a joint decision.", "NTA way to go!!", "ESH.  She should accept your answer and let it be.  You should have stuck to your \"no\" and avoided escalating the situation.\n\nAs an aside, your rule is a very stupid rule.

He needs to know that his mom does not get to dictate your relationship or anything that belongs in it.", "Maybe YTA for eskakating it. Just sticking with the No was enough.

Why do you keep asking?\" Sure. But she brought in other family members to try and push you around?

She doesn\u2019t have a right to a key to your house but what you did definitely escalated the situation. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t an advice sub but I recommend a Wi-Fi enabled smart lock for your house.

No means no it\u2019s a complete sentence why do people not understand that.", "No no no - NTA but your hubby is for not putting his foot down and setting a boundary.

There is no reason for her to go to your place when neither you nor husband are at home and as such need to let herself in with her own special key. For her to make nothing to become a big thing is definitely ridiculous. Tbf you escalated things only after the repeated pestering, without this, everyone suck", "NTA but immature. Stick with No and remind people that No is a complete sentence. There\u2019s way more power in the word NO with no further explanation than resorting to immature behavior.", "NTA.  I\u2019d have sent the key but not told her it was hers.", "Why not just give her a key but install an alarm system and don\u2019t tell her the code so if she happens to pop up unexpectedly, she\u2019ll have to deal with the cops when they come to arrest her", "NTA, no one has copies of our keys \u201cfor emergencies\u201d and we\u2019ve gotten by just dandy the last 15 years.", "NTA, you Just put her in her palace. Do not concede to emotional bribery", "A bit spicy but I like it.  Why didn't your husband handle his mom instead of you tho?", "NTA.  Tell her to f right off.", "NTA", "NTA, and I don't blame you for the snark. Adults who refuse to acknowledge that they have been told \"no\" deserve to be told no in a way they can't ignore. I'll give a kid some grace on that--I'm dealing with a similar \"can't hear 'no'\" problem with my 9-year-old right now--but not an adult older than me. It sounds like your husband's family has been enabling this kind of crappy MIL-tantrum by never giving her consequences for acting like this. I mean, what you did won't shut it down, no, but it at least gave you an opportunity for a laugh in the midst of the harassment.", "YTA. Even though your MIL sounds like a nightmare, you chose to pointlessly escalate the situation with a pointless, petty move rather than simply verbally reinforce a boundary.", "ESH.\nYou escalated with pettiness, she is also being inappropriate.", "NTA but I think the stunt made the situation worse.

Why does she need a key so badly?", "NTA - Your house, your rules. It's quite strange that they are insisting on having a key to your home. That's a special privilege to be trusted with and something that should only really be offered out, especially since it's quite a lot of responsibility - to put someone in charge of accessing your house.", "NTA, sometimes we have to try new ways of communicating the same information.\n\nWe are not required to constantly take verbal and physical and mental abuse and harassment in order to \u201cnot escalate\u201d a situation. The continuation of the harassment is already escalation.

Immature and unnecessary.", "NTA.  you set the boundaries in your own home, not your parents", "NTA Yes, it did escalate the situation, but MIL refused to de-escalate it with her demands for a key. She wasn\u2019t respecting the \u201cno\u201d. The emergency key excuse is just a way to have access to your home. If she doesn\u2019t respect your refusal to give her the key, she sure isn\u2019t going to respect your privacy.", "YTA. That\u2019s a stupid rule lol it defies logic. And you went super petty with the whole give her a copy of her own key bs. Grow up.", "ESH your mil is definitely the AH but what you did was petty. Stick to your No and if she doesn\u2019t respect it then she needs to leave or if it\u2019s happening when you\u2019re somewhere other than your home- you leave. \u201cMil since we have been over this before and you won\u2019t respect my no, this visit is over.

You provided her with a house key.", "NTA. \n\nAll of the E-S-H votes telling you that you shouldn\u2019t have been petty and escalated the situation are forgetting something - you\u2019d already tried the nice and polite way of setting boundaries. You\u2019d already told her no. *She* escalated the situation first when she responded to that with demands and selfishness and tantrums and got the family involved. \n\nThere are some people you just can\u2019t be gentle and polite to. In a perfect world everybody would respect others\u2019 nos and boundaries, but unfortunately that is not the world we live in. Some people only understand when you respond to them in the same way they treat everybody else. Sometimes, pettiness is warranted. You said no multiple times, she DEMANDED a key, so you gave her a key.

Who can say?  She should take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer, but not to the silly reason you gave.\n\nShouting meaningless and statements, and using the word \u2018residents\u2019 just make you the comical AH as well.", "NTA.

When has mocking ever achieved anything?\n\nFrom now on just don't engage.  Let your husband know where your boundaries are and if he lets his mother cross them then you and he are going to have a big problem.  And then leave her to him to deal with.
