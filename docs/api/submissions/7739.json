Yes you chose to rile her up, but she was way out of line to begin with, and it was pretty funny, so I side with you.", "YTA - You escalated the situation like a child.", "NTA, she's being weird.\n\nNext move: apologize profusely and send her a \"copy\" of a key that doesn't open your door.

Beautifully done.", "NTA. \n\nMILs who can\u2019t respect boundaries are not ones you want to give house keys to. \n\nOn another note, why do so many of the AITA have husbands who get into giant arguments to protect their mothers?

He needs to know that his mom does not get to dictate your relationship or anything that belongs in it.", "Maybe YTA for eskakating it. Just sticking with the No was enough.

Why do you keep asking?\" Sure. But she brought in other family members to try and push you around?

There is no reason for her to go to your place when neither you nor husband are at home and as such need to let herself in with her own special key.

Tell her to f right off.", "NTA", "NTA, and I don't blame you for the snark. Adults who refuse to acknowledge that they have been told \"no\" deserve to be told no in a way they can't ignore. I'll give a kid some grace on that--I'm dealing with a similar \"can't hear 'no'\" problem with my 9-year-old right now--but not an adult older than me.

Why does she need a key so badly?", "NTA - Your house, your rules. It's quite strange that they are insisting on having a key to your home. That's a special privilege to be trusted with and something that should only really be offered out, especially since it's quite a lot of responsibility - to put someone in charge of accessing your house.", "NTA, sometimes we have to try new ways of communicating the same information.\n\nWe are not required to constantly take verbal and physical and mental abuse and harassment in order to \u201cnot escalate\u201d a situation.

Immature and unnecessary.", "NTA.  you set the boundaries in your own home, not your parents", "NTA Yes, it did escalate the situation, but MIL refused to de-escalate it with her demands for a key. She wasn\u2019t respecting the \u201cno\u201d. The emergency key excuse is just a way to have access to your home. If she doesn\u2019t respect your refusal to give her the key, she sure isn\u2019t going to respect your privacy.", "YTA. That\u2019s a stupid rule lol it defies logic. And you went super petty with the whole give her a copy of her own key bs. Grow up.", "ESH your mil is definitely the AH but what you did was petty.

In a perfect world everybody would respect others\u2019 nos and boundaries, but unfortunately that is not the world we live in. Some people only understand when you respond to them in the same way they treat everybody else. Sometimes, pettiness is warranted.

Let your husband know where your boundaries are and if he lets his mother cross them then you and he are going to have a big problem.  And then leave her to him to deal with.

They all sound exhausting.", "You believe she trusts this woman?", "This", "There have been multiple times when I have needed to access my daughter\u2019s house when she is gone.

If she never tries to use it then you can give her one in the future, if needed, and just tell her you recently changed locks.", "To follow up,\n\nI would love to know what MIL thinks could be an EMERGENCY such that her having a key would resolve that emergency.  It would have to be something like you left your pet inside and one of you is travelling and the other is in the hospital. Or you have an alarm system to let you know about a leaking pipe but you're stuck at work--MIL to the rescue!\n\nThe point is, if YOU don't want or expect MIL to respond to these \"emergencies\" then she doesn't need a key.\n\nI think the \"emergency\" she's thinking of, is she is in your area and she wants to use your bathroom.", "This.

Telling her no obviously wasn't working", "She DEMANDED to have a Key. This is enough to escalate it", "great response suggestion", "Problem with that is she didn't ask her husband if he still wants a key to his mom's place. Wasn't her key to take really.", "Right. Suddenly every trivial thing would be an \"emergency\" that she would let herself in for, and next thing you know, she's up in arms about some personal thing she never should have known about in the first place.\n\nAn even more petty move? Give her a decoy key, tell her it is strictly for emergencies, then when she inevitably tries it out when they aren't home, she'll find out it doesn't work, rat on herself, then she'll have to justify what \"emergency\" she fabricated as a ruse to snoop around their personal stuff.", "Whatever in the history of Reddit has led you to believe a MIL would snoop? :)", "How is he not putting his foot down, exactly? He hasn\u2019t tried to convince op to give the key. As far as we can tell he\u2019s on board with *not* giving her a key.

His mother, he should be laying down the law and not leaving it you.", "I agree ESH but OP doesn\u2019t need to give a reason why someone should not have a key to their house.

It\u2019s a stupid rule that sounds overly controlling.", "I have never needed to have someone access my house. I'm 61 and do not see the need.", "Yeah like I don't get why you wouldn't want someone to have a spare key. I have keys to my mom's house and both my sister's houses, and they have keys to mine.  It's not the least uncommon to be on vacation or something and want someone to check on the house, or come feed my cat, or once we were out shopping and sent my mom to my house to measure the space available for a piece of furniture we were looking at. I'm cooking and don't have the piece of equipment I need? I can call mom and see if I can go borrow hers, even if she's traveling. The internet guy needs to come fix something and I can't get off work? Mom or dad can run over and be there. A package gets delivered when it's pouring rain and I know my sister is home? She'll run over at lunch and stick it in the garage. \n\nI get not wanting just anyone to have a key. Especially if it's a MIL you don't get along with. But no keys for anyone other than residents seems a bit strict to me.   If I'm in a car accident and unconscious in the hospital I want somebody to be able to get into my house and check on my cat.

That is an example of when it was helpful for someone else to have a key.", "Perharps, she's half or a quarter TA? But the mil is worse regardless.

She should have talked to him and not just escalated, but I absolutely hate when people demand access to other people's homes. You know MIL was going to use it for non emergencies.", "You are making a grandiose assumption.  Setting a boundary doesn't mean everyone will respect said boundary.\n\nIt's entirely likely that OP's husband also said no, and stop asking, and she didn't stop.  At which point, the non-asshole action would be to ignore any further requests.", "That\u2019s very true. She could just send the key without the note and lead MIL to believe whatever she wanted about the key.

If you can set where I ever stayed that nobody at any time for any reason would ever need access to anytime else's home. Please show that to me.", "Petty like what, like DEMANDING a key to someone else's house?", "The fact that it is their home is one hell of a good reason.

That doesn't mean that it's a good idea to give nobody a copy of the key that is not a resident.  You know *why* that's common?  Because in emergencies, someone outside the household should have access.\n\nWhat if they're traveling, for example, and there's a cold snap that pushes temps subzero for a week?  In weather like that, you need to put faucets on a slow drip to prevent pipes from freezing and bursting.  If someone has a key, they can go to your house and do that for you.  If they don't, you might just come home to $50,000 worth of damage.\n\nBut on the bright side, at least you decided who had access to your home!@!@!", "That seems the case.", "Just because it is something that you find to be a good idea, does not mean that it is one. They can certainly be preventative and proactive instead of reactive, in order to prevent situations like that, or they might have someone else whom they trust other than this woman who is this insistent. It does not have to be her, and she doesn\u2019t need to know who it might be. At the end of the day it is not your life, and therefore is not subject to your opinion.   When people set boundaries, they should be respected. And if no is already demonstrably, not working, then something else needs to be attempted."]}
