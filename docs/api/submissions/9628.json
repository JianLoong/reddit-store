It was made in response to a comment questioning why I would expect the OP to have mentioned her new medication to her husband.", "Because everyone has a breaking point.", "This scenario is a pretty low threshold for an adult to have a legitimate breaking point. And if you're making assumptions about the husband, for all we know he was at his breaking point of his wife not taking her psych meds consistently", "Not everyone has the funds to just not go to work. We have no information on what the medication is for. I'm guessing it's not something she's about to die from. And doctors don't have a problem arguing with anyone? Like, if they don't like a patient, they can refuse their business. They're doctors; after getting a doctorate, you give zero fucks.", "Or her doctor agreed that waiting until the weekend was a good idea. I\u2019ve had doctors tell me to do so. Or it\u2019s not a big deal and doesn\u2019t matter if she waits a couple days.

You being weird about it obviously triggered and upset him. \n\nDon\u2019t be sneaky and hide stuff and then be upset because people find out. Your overreaction to the situation is because you hadn\u2019t told him and were hiding it. If you\u2019re being honest with yourself, you probably wouldn\u2019t have been upset with him if he knew what the meds were.\n\nYou panicked bc you knew it was something being hidden. Next time do a better a job of hiding it or have conversations about your medications with your husband.\n\nThe real issue is why you don\u2019t feel comfortable enough to discuss this with him. If he\u2019s not a supportive partner you need to consider options ie couples therapy or divorce.", "NTA. He did this because he thinks he knows better than you. He did not allow you to comment on your choices. That\u2019s not a cool behavior. I will say that from my experience with psych meds, you sound like you\u2019re doing a good thing. I\u2019ve had an experience with an antidepressant I had been on previously being started up again. I hallucinated, wanted to tear my skin off because it felt wrong, and was so awake, I\u2019d call myself wired. For a good 24 hours. Waiting for the weekend is a normal thing and if he had taken five seconds to say \u201chey, did you forget to start this?\u201d You could have told him why. \n\nJust be aware that symptoms and side effects may not be present immediately. Side effects can build up over time before being noticed. So keep it in mind that it could cause an issue still, even with waiting for the weekend.", "he most likley saw it just standing on the desk and because he cares about you he wanted to make sure you take the meds and you did not talk to him about you wanted to wait for the weekend so it can come from his job of being a doctor that he saw it as you refusing to use the meds instead of waiting to start using them.\n\nNTA but you might wanna talk about things like this as you are wife and husband so there is no shame or weirdness to talk about stuff so that you both are on the same page", "Yeah, this is clearly one of those posts where the people involved have all sorts of issues going on and all we're getting on the sub is the tip of the iceberg", "He didn\u2019t even question why she\u2019d hidden the drugs, he just accepted and offered his help. He seems nice and understanding. She\u2019s definitely TA.", "I have a happy long term marriage and certainly don't discuss all my medications with my husband. That's between me and my doctor. My husband gets told what he needs to know. \n\nFor example, one of my meds has a side effect, and my doctor is giving me another pill to counter that side effect. It's working fine and my husband doesn't need to know about that. Both meds are safe and have no serious or deadly effects my husband would need to watch for. They are as safe as ibuprofen.

I don't even open my siblings even *if* I know what is inside. Its simply not my property. They themselves don't open mine. \n\nI would personally set the boundary that your packages are yours and only you should open it.

He was in the wrong for acting like you needed him to do it for you. His sigh and eyeroll that you mentioned is disrespectful.

That\u2019s such a stupid argument. \n\nI was advised by my doctor that I should tell someone close to me when I started taking them as some of the emotional side effects would be more apparent to an outsider than to myself- so I told my fianc\u00e9 that I was going to start taking them that weekend and to let me know if i was acting weird.", "Yes I tell my partner when I take medicine because a) that\u2019s normal and b) he needs to know my medical history and allergies in case of  an emergency. \n\nEvery time you come to defend the reason you don\u2019t tell him it gets weirder. \n\nEveryone is entitled to what works for them in their own relationship, but your structure is less than ordinary so most of us are going to feel like something is wrong/unhealthy about your relationship.", "She\u2019s an adult and should have communicated about the medication.

Maybe your idea of marriage is complete nudity, opening each other's mail, watching each other work, reading each other's email, and attending each other's medical, dental, and therapy appointments, but most people want some personal autonomy in their life.  Maybe they're anti-anxiety meds because her husband won't let her open her own mail or work in peace.", "Emotions aren\u2019t negative, and you can\u2019t control how you feel", "This individual states she is trying to improve her personal well-being. Do you think the husband's behaviors might be contributing to these issues, which caused OP to have a negative reaction? It just seems strange that OP would go from 0 - 10 in seconds just because of this one situation.", "That's BS. Medical treatment is between a patient and the physician. \n\nI don't need to discuss every little thing with my husband because he doesn't control me. I can handle when I start taking a new medication because sometimes it's nice to coordinate dates when prescriptions run out so I'm not going to the pharmacy multiple times a week. Or perhaps I still have some pills left over in my last bottle to finish first. I certainly know how to open my own mail and packages. \n\nIf there is some medical information I want my husband to know, I will tell him. We trust each other and are both mentally competent.", "Same. But also, my husband would *never* talk to me this way or behave that way.

Or, you know, assume his wife is a reasonably competent adult who can handle her own medication and body?", "Part of me wonders if OP has had a history with dr husband giving unsolicited advice.

Maybe she quit telling him bc she felt like he was overstepping the past? \n\nThat\u2019s the only thing I can think of that would make half sense\u2026.", "I'm not lumping anything. \n\nIf her doctor advised her to tell someone about the medicine, she would do that when she started taking it. She hadn't even started yet, but the husband just had to open her mail without permission, then get on her case about her treatment plan. He's an asshole for opening her mail and not talking to her politely. \n\nShe did nothing wrong.", "Agreed. I\u2019m the same way. Yes I tell my husband when I take anything even as small as an ibuprofen. If I\u2019m taking one it usually means I\u2019m in pain of some kind and I tell him everything he\u2019s my best friend.

Physician said it was fine to wait until the weekend. \n\nHusband was out of line.", "Results are the same; the physician knew she would wait until the weekend and that was fine. None of this allows the husband to open her mail or her medication bottles. It doesn't excuse his tone or rudeness toward her, whatsoever. If he had issues with her, he can address them politely like an adult.", "Just because she married him doesn't give him carte blanche to do whatever he wants. Permission needs to be given. She doesn't open his mail. He couldn't keep his hands to himself which would be excusable if he was a young child still learning and not a grown adult. He could also have asked her if his curiosity got too much for him.", "No, he is not violating HIPAA law, nor federal law. Stop talking about things you have zero clue about. HIPAA applies to covered entities, he is not acting as a covered entity, he's just some guy in his own house. \n\nAnd maybe you should be on some anti-axiety pills you're blowing the situation up exponentially as you were typing that out. Where did she say he won't let her open mail, or that he reads all her mail, or that he is attending her Dr appointments. He saw mail on a desk, in his house, he opened it, that is extremely common among married couples where any bill, letter, notification, etc could be addressed to either person.", "This is BS. One common side effect of a new medication is diarrhea. Not something you want at the office. Better to wait until the weekend. And how is her husband going \"assist\" with that?

You are only recommending 1/2 of the conversation that is needed.", "i mean if it's something like ADHD meds, and she's always forgetting shit, maybe it's not the right assumption that she's reasonably competent?

Perspective is everything and I will take a moment to be grateful for my own health so I appreciate you opening my perspective to that. \n\nI still think based on ops reaction and the lack of Boundaries from her husband they still need to have a better conversation around how and when to communicate and what those boundaries are. As long as both people are on the same page I think that\u2019s what truly counts and it sadly doesn\u2019t sound like they are which ultimately I still think boils down to overall communication and expectations.
