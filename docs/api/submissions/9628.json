Your husband is a doctor so of course he's going to be concerned about a bottle of prescription medication sitting on your desk, unopened for three days. The way he responded was a bit over the top and aggressive. He should have used his words first before taking it up on himself to distribute your meds into your med container. That said, you know he's a doctor and likely concerned that you are delaying treatment. You could have simply told him why you were delaying treatment when he picked up the bag. Y'all both need to work on communication with each other. I've been married for twenty years and my husband and I have always been very open with each other about our healthcare.

You didn't tell him about wanting to wait for the weekend to take it, so in his mind, as a doctor, it looks like you're avoiding taking medication that you need. He's still in the wrong, but snapping at him also wasn't cool. If you two sit down and talk, he'll probably apologize after you tell him your reasoning.
