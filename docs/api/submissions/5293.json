I (30f) and my girlfriend (38) have been together for almost two years now. Things have been moving very fast between us. She's the love of my life!\n\nHowever, I have to say that she doesn't really help much around the house. She doesn't cook, doesn't wash the dishes, and doesn't vacuum. To her credit, she does clean the bathroom sink, toilet and shower, but the rest pretty much falls on me. She also puts her laundry in the washer, but she either won't take it out to dry or won't fold it once it's done. And even when I fold her stuff, she lets it sit on a chair or table for weeks without putting it away.\n\nShe has tons of qualities, but she's a bit of a slob, and she knows it. She often jokes about how I have a lower tolerance for the mess around the place, which is why I do things before she does. The thing that hurts me is that, as a feminist, she likes to debate on gender inequalities in the household with our friends and family. She talks about how some men won't take initiatives, will feign incompetence at chores so they won't be asked to do them again, or will say \"I was about to do that\" when their wife actually gives up and does the task herself. But she does the exact same things!\n\nWell, last year, we spent christmas time at her parents' place. Her family is a lot like mine, which means they are generally nice, but they can be controlling and belittling. Some of their jokes are more like jabs, which my girlfriend really hates. One evening at dinner, her mother joked about how I surely did all the cooking at home, and I just laughed without answering.\n\nLater that night, my girlfriend told me I was a butthole for not defending her, and that I was supposed to stand up for her in situations like these. I apologized and agreed to step in the next time it would happen.\n\nA couple days later, we were both at my parents' place, and they basically did the exact same thing for me, joking about how I surely was terrible at keeping the house clean. My girlfriend immediately stepped in and defended me, which I appreciate. However, I felt like this was only fair, since I actually do keep the house clean!\n\nI don't know...

It didn't sound like a belittlement, but an actual fact.\n\nHonestly, you both need to discuss expectations and actual responsibilities. She's 38, not a kid to be picked up after.", "NTA - What were you supposed to do, jump in and say she does cook, when she doesn't? Or say she doesn't cook but she does other chores instead, which would also be a lie? I mean maybe you could have not laughed, but I think your reaction was fine. They obviously know what she's like.", "NTA.  If you family belittles her, you should jump in.  However, there is no need to get involved in her break and forth with her own parents.", "NTA - should have just shrugged and said \u201cbut it\u2019s the truth - you don\u2019t cook and I do the majority of the cleaning\u201d.", "NTA. how can you defend against the truth?", "If she wants you to stick up and defend her she would have actually had to some work too. Oh that\u2019s not true she cooked\u2026 but if she didn\u2019t then you\u2019re NTA. She has literal zero defense. If she wants you to defend her she actually has to compromise at least once in a blue moon and help out so you have relevant examples of when that wasn\u2019t true and she did help. Otherwise she expects praise for doing zero.", "NTA but perhaps have this discussion with her and explain that that is why you didn't defend her?  She knows she's a slob and she's basically asking you to lie.  Tell her you won't lie but you could say, \"She does a phenomenal job keeping the bathroom clean!\"  I'm not a fan of hypocrites so it would be difficult to defend her in that situation if I was you.", "NTA - these are her parents not some random stranger.", "NTA. It\u2019s the truth.\n\nI personally am a minor slob and am okay if people call me out on it.", "NTA You only defend people from lies, not the truth.\n\nNow that's that out of the way: you deserve a partner who treats you like an equal, not a maid.", "Hmm.   \n\n\nPersonally, I don't you're TA but yeah you should have probably defended her the first time like \"haha she does do this and that blah blah\" (try to bullshit ur way basically) to at least change their perception of her as the more those jokes are tolerated, the worse it will get.   \n\n\nRelationship-wise, you should probably sit down with your partner about it. How you feel that the chores have been one-sided. Expecting change just because of age will only result in resentment. Remember to approach her as calmly and direct as you can. Come up with a chore list and divide it among yourselves.  \n\n\nIf she doesn't budge and you insist on working things out, only do your part of the chores. Say she puts dirty clothes in front of the washing machine, put yours in but leave hers out. Laundry is done? Fold yours and leave hers in a basket.  \n\n\nAt the end of the day, slobs only become slobs because people adjust for them and tolerate them", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
