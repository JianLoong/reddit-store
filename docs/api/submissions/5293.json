I (30f) and my girlfriend (38) have been together for almost two years now. Things have been moving very fast between us. She's the love of my life!\n\nHowever, I have to say that she doesn't really help much around the house. She doesn't cook, doesn't wash the dishes, and doesn't vacuum. To her credit, she does clean the bathroom sink, toilet and shower, but the rest pretty much falls on me. She also puts her laundry in the washer, but she either won't take it out to dry or won't fold it once it's done. And even when I fold her stuff, she lets it sit on a chair or table for weeks without putting it away.\n\nShe has tons of qualities, but she's a bit of a slob, and she knows it. She often jokes about how I have a lower tolerance for the mess around the place, which is why I do things before she does. The thing that hurts me is that, as a feminist, she likes to debate on gender inequalities in the household with our friends and family. She talks about how some men won't take initiatives, will feign incompetence at chores so they won't be asked to do them again, or will say \"I was about to do that\" when their wife actually gives up and does the task herself. But she does the exact same things!\n\nWell, last year, we spent christmas time at her parents' place. Her family is a lot like mine, which means they are generally nice, but they can be controlling and belittling. Some of their jokes are more like jabs, which my girlfriend really hates. One evening at dinner, her mother joked about how I surely did all the cooking at home, and I just laughed without answering.\n\nLater that night, my girlfriend told me I was a butthole for not defending her, and that I was supposed to stand up for her in situations like these. I apologized and agreed to step in the next time it would happen.\n\nA couple days later, we were both at my parents' place, and they basically did the exact same thing for me, joking about how I surely was terrible at keeping the house clean.

However, there is no need to get involved in her break and forth with her own parents.", "NTA - should have just shrugged and said \u201cbut it\u2019s the truth - you don\u2019t cook and I do the majority of the cleaning\u201d.", "NTA. how can you defend against the truth?", "If she wants you to stick up and defend her she would have actually had to some work too. Oh that\u2019s not true she cooked\u2026 but if she didn\u2019t then you\u2019re NTA. She has literal zero defense. If she wants you to defend her she actually has to compromise at least once in a blue moon and help out so you have relevant examples of when that wasn\u2019t true and she did help. Otherwise she expects praise for doing zero.", "NTA but perhaps have this discussion with her and explain that that is why you didn't defend her?  She knows she's a slob and she's basically asking you to lie.  Tell her you won't lie but you could say, \"She does a phenomenal job keeping the bathroom clean!\"  I'm not a fan of hypocrites so it would be difficult to defend her in that situation if I was you.", "NTA - these are her parents not some random stranger.", "NTA. It\u2019s the truth.\n\nI personally am a minor slob and am okay if people call me out on it.", "NTA You only defend people from lies, not the truth.\n\nNow that's that out of the way: you deserve a partner who treats you like an equal, not a maid.", "Hmm.   \n\n\nPersonally, I don't you're TA but yeah you should have probably defended her the first time like \"haha she does do this and that blah blah\" (try to bullshit ur way basically) to at least change their perception of her as the more those jokes are tolerated, the worse it will get.   \n\n\nRelationship-wise, you should probably sit down with your partner about it. How you feel that the chores have been one-sided. Expecting change just because of age will only result in resentment. Remember to approach her as calmly and direct as you can. Come up with a chore list and divide it among yourselves.  \n\n\nIf she doesn't budge and you insist on working things out, only do your part of the chores. Say she puts dirty clothes in front of the washing machine, put yours in but leave hers out. Laundry is done? Fold yours and leave hers in a basket.  \n\n\nAt the end of the day, slobs only become slobs because people adjust for them and tolerate them", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She should have admitted it was true!", "INFO: how did she expect you to defend her? Did she want you to lie? or just defend her from their jabs? \n\nHonestly, you could be my boyfriend as we have a similar division of housework. I do the deep cleaning of bathroom, vacuuming, mopping and he does daily dishes and decluttering, making the bed and daily laundry (too much). i will wash dishes when he's out of town and I wait to have a load to do laundry. \n\nMy aversion to housework is from my family, they were so critical of how I did things and they were constantly cleaning, renovating. I simply don't value spending my free time cleaning that often. it's not relaxing and it's not necessary, until it is. \n\nI do not appreciate jabs about my housekeeping, it stirs up old wounds and I find it superficial and pointless.", "NTA because it's true. \n\nBut I sometimes do the exact same thing, leaving laundry for weeks and struggling to keep up with cooking/cleaning. I recently found out that these can actually be signs of undiagnosed ADHD (which middle aged /older women are under diagnosed for) .

For my part, I've been diagnosed with autism five years ago. She keeps telling me I should get checked for ADHD as well because I'm very unfocused and forgetful, but I'm in no rush.\n\nI don't press her on the matter of chores for this reason, even though it doesn't feel very fair. I accepted that she just finds it harder to do her part than I do. However I wasn't expecting to have to pretend like we share the load equally.\n\nI think that, deep down, she's ashamed, which is why I thought I might be the butthole for indirectly exposing her.", "Do we know that is what she wanted? Maybe her idea of defending her isn't to lie but point out what else she does or dismiss the jab.", "Absolutely, there is no need to pretend that you are equally contributing when you are not. \n\nAdhd aside, I echo what other people have said here and I think you need to sit down and work out a fairer division of household tasks. You can also try methods to help manage things particularly given that both of you may have adhd.  For example,  having a designated 15 mins a day where you both clean/tidy (you can also race against a timer to make it a game). Or you can task swap on things you each find difficult (like you fold her laundry if she vacuums the floors). Hope this helps and best of luck to you and your gf :)", "INFO:\n\nWhy are you telling us how you feel about all this, and not your girlfriend?\n\nIt sounds like you have some resentment towards her, and feel that she isn't contributing to the household in an equitable way.", "Maybe OP needs to ask her parents what skills they taught her while they're so busy making jabs. \n\nAnd explore if your gf is one of the neurodivergent crowd.

Defending means you point out that she does stuff - so she wants  you to lie to the people she loves?\n\nJust flat out say you wont lie. You will defend her if they say something wrong but not will not make something up.\n\nAs for your friends and when she goes on her feminist rants - tell her upfront now that if she repeats that you will ask her publicly why she behaves that.\n\nTell her to drop the topic. She cant expect you to  lie and she shouldnt be a hypocrite.", "NTA, next time when they belittle her, you should jump in....in belittling her, jk.", "NTA. If the truth is that you do actually do most if not all of the cooking, there\u2019s not a lot to say to that. Best option would have been \u201cI do do most of the cooking, but GF does (insert thing GF does and does well) and I appreciate that.\u201d\n\nAs someone in a \u201clesbian\u201d relationship (I\u2019m NB, AFAB, and bi, but whatever.), I get this post in so many ways. And I admit, we joke occasionally about one of us being the \u201chusband\u201d because classic gender roles has the man doing the job at hand. But when I became disabled, splitting the workload suddenly had to change in a big way. I can\u2019t do much of the actual cleaning, so I take over a lot of the mental workload and communicate with my wife about ways I can and can\u2019t help. She has said often that these things help make it feel more of an even distribution. \n\nY\u2019all need to talk about the work load, the expectations, and what kind of \u201cdefense\u201d she\u2019s hoping for when the comment is based on a fact. And honestly? I would not be able to resist chiming in the next time she went on a \u201chusbands weaponize incompetence\u201d rant going \u201cbut wait. Isn\u2019t that what you do?\u201d \n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be nice. But I don\u2019t think I could hold back. And might help her make the connection.", "Ok, no judgement yet, I want INFO: \n\n1- Have you two sat down and made an agreement regarding chores? Divide them equally and make a board. \n\n2- you both spend the same time working on the house? Sometimes one single chore can take ours, and other 10 can be done in just one hour. Also, the same chore might take different people ridiculously different time. I can wash a mountain of dishes in 40min. My husband takes 3h. \n\n3- do you cave in and do her share? If you do this, STOP RIGHT NOW. Don't ever touch her share unless she verbally asks for your help and acknowledges your work. If you do her work and let it slide, she will start to see it as \"you doing your work\" instead of \"you doing HER work\". \n\n4- Is she actually doing nothing or is she doing \"ghost work\"? My ex would complain I do \"nothing\", but I decided to actually DO NOTHING and the house almost fell apart. That's because I used to do my share on my own time, quietly, and it slide right under everyone's radar. It's very hard to acknowledge your partner's work when they are ghost cleaners like myself. That's why I make announcements now lol \"MARIANA WILL WASH DISHES IN FIVE. ALL DISHES, ASSEMBLE.\" Husband says I don't have to. But I actually enjoy. Makes me feel a little proud. Yay, my depressed ass is doing dishes. In case you are the ghost cleaner, OP, START SHINING. Anounce your work. Keep tabs. Hard evidence is undisputable. She might not be seeing YOUR hard work and wondering why her clothes aren't magically folding themselves.\n\n5- Are you both neurotypical and not disabled? Executive disfunction sucks. Maybe she could get help. \n\nExtra: a few tips \n\n1- everything not discussed builds resentment. Don't rub things on her face, but be clear, gather evidence, and talk it out. I can suggest an exercise, both of you sit with a piece of paper, and make two lists \"what I do on the house\" and summarize everything you do, and \"what my partner does in the house\" and summarize everything you see them doing. Your partner writes from her perspective. Then you two compare the lists. This will help, I swear by my cats fluffy ears. \n\n2- if you have a disproportionate share, make sure you are compensated for it if you chose to keep it like that. This means you can choose a privilege, like choosing the restaurant more often, getting a few bucks from the house budget to spend on yourself, anything, discuss this as well. \n\n3- whenever you feel like doing her share yourself, ASK FIRST if she is ok with you doing it. This will make her extra aware of your work and aware of her negligence as well.", " Don't help passive aggressive at her parents house ffs.", "Just like she did when his parents belittled him? Oh, wait! He didn't!", "Right? How would that even look?\n\n\"I bet you do all the cooking\" \n\n\"Hey now! That... hey!\"\n\nWut?", "As I understand it, it didn't matter weither it was true or not, nor did she really care what I said as long as I didn't let the jab land. I should have said something, anything.\n\nYour situation sounds very similar indeed. She doesn't want to let her parents treat her the same way as they did when she was younger. I understand now that it wasn't really about the chores being done or who did them, and more about not subjecting her to past trauma.", "Op is a she", "the OP is also a woman", "sorry", "apparently I cant read!!! lol"]}
