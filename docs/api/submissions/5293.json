For example,  having a designated 15 mins a day where you both clean/tidy (you can also race against a timer to make it a game).

I can\u2019t do much of the actual cleaning, so I take over a lot of the mental workload and communicate with my wife about ways I can and can\u2019t help.

Divide them equally and make a board. \n\n2- you both spend the same time working on the house? Sometimes one single chore can take ours, and other 10 can be done in just one hour. Also, the same chore might take different people ridiculously different time. I can wash a mountain of dishes in 40min. My husband takes 3h. \n\n3- do you cave in and do her share? If you do this, STOP RIGHT NOW. Don't ever touch her share unless she verbally asks for your help and acknowledges your work. If you do her work and let it slide, she will start to see it as \"you doing your work\" instead of \"you doing HER work\". \n\n4- Is she actually doing nothing or is she doing \"ghost work\"? My ex would complain I do \"nothing\", but I decided to actually DO NOTHING and the house almost fell apart. That's because I used to do my share on my own time, quietly, and it slide right under everyone's radar. It's very hard to acknowledge your partner's work when they are ghost cleaners like myself. That's why I make announcements now lol \"MARIANA WILL WASH DISHES IN FIVE. ALL DISHES, ASSEMBLE.\" Husband says I don't have to. But I actually enjoy. Makes me feel a little proud. Yay, my depressed ass is doing dishes. In case you are the ghost cleaner, OP, START SHINING. Anounce your work. Keep tabs. Hard evidence is undisputable. She might not be seeing YOUR hard work and wondering why her clothes aren't magically folding themselves.\n\n5- Are you both neurotypical and not disabled? Executive disfunction sucks. Maybe she could get help. \n\nExtra: a few tips \n\n1- everything not discussed builds resentment. Don't rub things on her face, but be clear, gather evidence, and talk it out. I can suggest an exercise, both of you sit with a piece of paper, and make two lists \"what I do on the house\" and summarize everything you do, and \"what my partner does in the house\" and summarize everything you see them doing. Your partner writes from her perspective. Then you two compare the lists. This will help, I swear by my cats fluffy ears. \n\n2- if you have a disproportionate share, make sure you are compensated for it if you chose to keep it like that. This means you can choose a privilege, like choosing the restaurant more often, getting a few bucks from the house budget to spend on yourself, anything, discuss this as well. \n\n3- whenever you feel like doing her share yourself, ASK FIRST if she is ok with you doing it. This will make her extra aware of your work and aware of her negligence as well.", " Don't help passive aggressive at her parents house ffs.", "Just like she did when his parents belittled him?

We did talk about this issue several times, and although I know she tried to make it up to me, she could never do it on the long run. We tried boards and labels and all, but the energy just isn't there.\n\n2. I agree that some tasks are longer and harder than others. Cleaning a shower takes more time than washing the dishes. However, even taking this into account, I'm still the one spending the most time taking care of the house. The only reason I don't clean the shower is because I get terribly sick at the sight of body waste, and I can't stand touching the hair clogs.\n\n3. I admit I do this, yes. I know it's not the best solution, but I also don't want to come across as petty or passive-agressive. I try to think of relationships as a 60-40 type of deal.

I believe my girlfriend is sincerely aware of the amount of chores I do. Because of my work, I have to be away two to three days a week, and nothing really gets done while I'm away.

Like it truly would not make sense for you to fight her family for stating a basic fact even if it was in a slightly rude way to her. If she's insecure about the fact that you do all the cooking and most of the cleaning cleaning, it sounds like she should step up and participate.\n\nIt really sounds like in general you guys need to have a real conversation about how your relationship works, because it is weird that she doesn't do much work for your mutual house, and is just trying to win an argument to distract from that point at the expense of your parents. There would be no reason for her to try and create an artificial fight with your parents if she just acted like a partner", "NTA. It wasn't belittling she's just mad everyone knows how she is.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't have to lie to defend someone. She didn't step in cause the 'Rents were wrong, she stepped in cause she didn't want them trying to belittle you because (according to your post) they get their kicks by tearing others down, and she doesn't like they do that. \n\nIt was as simple as not engaging and telling them that you don't like them trying to make jokes about your and hers personal life. If you aren't willing to set boundaries so her family doesn't tearing her down which they have probably been doing her whole life. \n\nThat fact alone implies that you wanted someone to cut her down a little because you feel hurt in the household because of her political opinions vs how she conducts herself and hearing other people tear her down a bit was vindicating for you. She is your partner. If you have a problem you discuss it with her and don't leave her open for other people to go after her, specially if it's something they are known to do. \n\nAfter thoughts:\n\nIt sounds like she probably has either ADHD or something with similar symptoms. Generally people with those issues can get 'trapped' in loops and fail to do thing other people think are easy or 'common' to do. It's called ADHD paralysis, ADHD freeze, and brain crashing if you want to look it up (Source: diagnosed 27 years ago, it's one of many symptoms I've had to learn to work around)\n\nWhile that IS NOT a guarentee as something she's dealing with, you guys should probably look into testing at least.

But it's not right to let your girlfriend get belittled when she has now indicated that those jabs do hurt her.\n\nYou don't have to lie, but you can certainly talk up the qualities you love about her instead of chuckling and dismissing it. Isn't that more important? You make up for what she lacks as she does for you. \n\nMake it mushy, make it embarrassing for the rest of the family, but build each other up in the process so your families experience wholesome defeat.", "Indeed, and if she also wants you to defend her against her parents if they do ever say something that's actually out of pocket it's something that needs to be clarified before. It just sounds like she wants someone to direct her anger at since she has no retort for her parents because they are right.", "But it also sounds like they haven't discussed the boundary of how they deal with each other's families. Given that she's just saying OP's supposed to defend her without that being a discussion between them, it just sounds like she's mad about what they are saying and is trying to make OP an asshole", "It sounds like before that you and your wife need to have a sit-down on what the boundaries are on dealing with each other's parents. Because it also leaves less space for you to be turned into the villain for not stepping up if you have a clear boundary with each other", "NTA for how you presented the situation, but...\n\nI'm male, with generally higher standards of cleanliness compared to past partners and housemates. It took me a long while to be able to identify, control, minimise, and finally eliminate resentment towards those I live with due to *me* maintaining *my own* standards.\n\nThe method: gratefulness exercises. Make a list of 5 qualities your partner has that you're grateful for, and think about those qualities while you're being a Domestic God.\n\nDo this, and after a given time, you'll automatically respond with 'well, partner may not cook, but she has a, b, c, d, e qualities that I appreciate way more than her cooking'. Suddenly you take a negative into a quintuple positive, that comes straight from the heart, while acknowledging the truth and validating your partner. No need for silence, deception, or defensiveness. You'll also minimise resentment in both you and your partner, which is an absolute requirement in every relationship.", "Think you two need to have a discussion on the chores. It\u2019s not just that she doesn\u2019t do them (or as many), but then rants about traditional gender roles and then expects you to step up. \n\nTalk about that and then you can figure out how to deal with the in law jabs.", "I told my spouse that I love my family and we\u2019re very close but sometimes when we\u2019re all together, I feel like the odd one out and that they sometimes gang up on me. I didn\u2019t ask that he stick up for me, only that he doesn\u2019t pile on with them. \n\nShe may just not want to feel piled on by them and you. You could have always interjected with \u201cshe may not cook, but she does XYZ which I love\u201d. Turn it into a positive instead of laughing at her expense. \n\n\nAnd if you have resentment regarding your relationship division of labor, the time to discuss that is separate from the parents thing.", "If my parents who you are aware regularly say things just to make me feel bad as \"jokes\" make a mean joke/comment just to make me feel bad, I don't think we should have to have a boundary discussion about *not laughing at me with them*. \n\nAgain, they aren't making this comment to validate op or because they're trying to help. They just want to make the gf feel bad. I don't need anyone in my life who wants to laugh when my shitty parents try to make me feel bad bc theyre mad that I don't do enough chores.", "What is lose-lose about not laughing along when your in laws are mean to the person you love? Why does it need to be an argument? You can just not laugh. Or say she keeps the bathroom clean. Or literally anything that isn't laughing at her parents mean spirited comments that have absolutely nothing to do with your chore distribution and everything to do with who they are as people?", "Nah I\u2019m going with a chuckle to the in laws shitty joke to keep the peace. \nMaybe it\u2019s different for hetero relationships, but I\u2019d bet it\u2019s not. You know what I\u2019m not doing? Getting in between family jabs and jokes. Now if it was my parents that were making a jab at my SO\u2026 hell yeah stand up to that shit.\n\nBut a chuckle to a shitty joke that isn\u2019t even off base just to keep the drama free with in laws is fine.", "You can be the kind of person who laughs at your significant others expense if you want to, but I adamantly disagree that it's an ok thing to do or that being supportive requires lying, arguing, or otherwise making a scene.", "Those parents know their daughter...", "NTA, she doesn't get to be some feminist crusader against men being incompetent and then do that or worse and expect you to defend her!", "NTA. It was the truth and obviously her family already knows what she\u2019s like. Lol. I wouldn\u2019t stress about it.", "But\u2026it\u2019s also private. Outside of the house, you\u2019re a team. Those convos don\u2019t need to be public until you cross into abuse. Op needs to be direct instead of passive aggressive, and gf needs to manage her executive function. But that\u2019s not an excuse not to have your partner\u2019s back.", "Most of this would be good to add as an edit to your post :) especially the end. I read this post and was like wow sounds like me (by myself, I\u2019m better in a relationship \ud83e\udd23). Executive dysfunction really sucks. You don\u2019t have to answer but you mentioned diagnosed. Are you both officially diagnosed or self? \n\nI was recently diagnosed with ADHD and, while medication isn\u2019t the only treatment, it\u2019s been really good in helping me unlearn bad habits and have the mental energy to start and finish tasks. Maybe something she can consider if she\u2019s not already on it (and if she is, maybe consider an alternative lol)"]}
