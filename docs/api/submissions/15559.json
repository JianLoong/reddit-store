Talk to your parents about this show them this post to back you up.\n\n2. Based on their reaction and whether or not, they agree with you start setting boundaries for yourself and for your sister. Regardless \n\n\u2022 If they agree with you sit down and talk about finding a solution for your situation.\n\n\u2022 If they don\u2019t then you still need to set boundaries with them and your sister most likely give all of them an ultimatum if they allow your sister to continue to steal your clothes etc.\n\n3. By doing these boundaries I would recommend if you decide to go to college start keeping the clothes you really like with you at your college dorms and keep the clothes you either don\u2019t want anymore or don\u2019t fit you in your closet at your parents house.\n\n4. While your living at home see if you can find a way to hide your nice clothes away from your sister maybe get a separate suitcase with a locking key on it. Or maybe get a lock for your closet door ask your parents if this is okay \n\n5.

Her behavior is unacceptable. She cannot go around stealing stuff from people. Whoever she pleases, especially from family and friends. I would also share this with your parents that once you\u2019re sister is no longer able to steal from her don\u2019t bet that she\u2019ll either start stealing from other people or worse start shoplifting when she can no longer get to you her behavior and her actions were only get her into trouble one of these days.", "Lock up your nice clothes.
