This way you wont have to deal with situations like this.", "NTA.  You may wish to ask for a lock for your door  if you have your own room.  (Be prepared for a \"no\".)   Also ask that they please enforce rules with their other daughter.   Tell them she won't listen to you because you aren't the parent and you need the boss to step in.", "Easy NTA. Selfish means you take an unfair portion of resources meant for a group or others, or act in a way that harms others for personal benefit. You earned the your own clothing and are not harming her at all by refusing to loan your clothes to her. Your sister is the selfish one, acting like she's entitled to your possessions, stealing and destroying them when you say no.", "NTA and if you worked hard to buy stuff you want, its yours to keep. Your sister wearing your clothes is one thing but giving it away to a friend shows lack of respect and contempt on her part. She's the one who is being jealous and you know better how she's going to behave. Maybe its worth investing further in clothes once you have moved out so that such events wont happen.", "NTA. Your sister is an entitled brat, you don\u2019t owe her anything. I suggest speaking to your parents about her behaviors.", "NTA because she's not entitled to taking anybody's stuff just because she likes it. And your refusal to let her take a shirt surely does not excuse her taking it regardless, let alone giving it to someone else. It just makes her more at fault. This reasoning sounds just ridiculous. \n\nit would be good to get more info, though: does your family struggle financially? has she borrowed your \"less fancy\" clothes before? or anybody else's in the house? it wouldn't be an excuse here, but would give some useful context", "NTA-she would be buying a new shirt. She deliberately took your shirt then on top of that let a friend borrow it. You bought this, paid for it, and worked hard for what you have. Tell her next time she does this you will report it stolen and then sue her for damages to your property. Keep all your receipts to everything you buy in lock box or safe space to where she can not get them.\n\nObviously she is 16 and you wouldn\u2019t do that entirely but it\u2019s nice to scare people who think they can do whatever they want. Most importantly tell your parents about this. Do not share clothes with her at all especially after this total disrespect. You are not entitled to share anything with her. Maybe this will teach her to get a job so she can afford her own things if she wants it so badly.", "NTA - where are your parents? The little brat needs to reimburse you for the t-shirt (and something for going behind your back too). You don't owe her anything, and after her poor behavior, she doesn't deserve any compromise before she learns to be more careful with clothes and with your trust.", "NTA. Technically you can expect her to pay you back for the shirt. You're being very nice by not giving her consequences. Not letting her wear your clothes isn't unfair or malicious or anything, at this point it's protecting your items.", "this doesnt even need to be explained you are nta your sister is selfish", "NTA,\n\nYour sister needs to understand that she being selfish, even if the stuff wasn't expensive you brought that stuff.", "NTA.   \nGet a lock for your door.", "NTA -- will your parents stick up for you and make her pay for it?

On the one hand, you don\u2019t owe your sister any clothes. You earned the money, and you bought them yourself. Plus, she proved your fear by being irresponsible about it, resulting in your shirt getting ruined.\n\nHowever, you might have a calm discussion with her and try to come up with some sort of compromise.

She is 16. She can get a job", "NTA\n\nThis is a pretty common thing among sisters and roommates though.  You're definitely not doing anything wrong by not sharing.  You are not obligated to share your belongings with your sister.  She's also trying to put blame on you, even though it's all on her.  Don't let her do that.  It's her fault and she knows it.\n\nIf I were you, I'd get a lock on my door so she can't get in and help herself to your closet.  If your parents aren't cool with that, explain and tell them either they or your sister reimburse you for the shirt she destroyed and future clothing she ruins, or they let you get a lock so it doesn't happen again.", "NTA. \n\nAnd it getting ruined is *why* you didn\u2019t want to lend it to her. \n\nShe\u2019s acting like an entitled brat. And taking it without your knowledge is theft. \n\nHave you told your parents? What do/would they say about this? \n\nYou have a job and have every right to treat yourself to nice things. And you *don\u2019t* have to treat sister. In fact, sister needs to pay for the shirt her careless friend ruined too. \n\nI think there needs to be a talk, followed by some consequences for sister, and maybe doing a bunch of chores for you, in order to work off the shirt, if she can\u2019t afford to pay you back.", "Family is important, but OP's sister thinks clothes more important.   I would not compromise.", ">Family is more important than clothes.\n\nVery true. But it's difficult to deal with if the sister is a spoiled brat. It sounds like she feels entitled to borrow the clothes and wouldn't be the least bit grateful if she was allowed to. And the fact that she then ruined the shirt with no remorse just shows she got very little respect.", "Yes, family is more important than clothes. But so is respect. OP\u2019s sister has disrespected her pretty hard \u2014 and out of self respect, OP needs to maintain clear boundaries. Compromising at this point would reward the awful behavior sister has engaged in to this point. \n\nHard NTA", "Yes.\n\nI guess I'm rash on this point but: you never need all your clothes at the same time right ? Thus if you can trust that your sister will keep the clothes nice and clean, I would personally see no point in refusing", "I\u2019m not so sure. I think the sister might be feeling left behind, and the clothes are a symptom of that. She\u2019s still a teenager though, and is shit at communicating those feelings.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t excuse what she did, however.", "That\u2019s true. Sort of a \u2018garbage in, garbage out\u2019 scenario.", "Not necessarily. A compromise would mean that sister would have to give up something, too.", "But her sister has already ruined one of her shirts\u2026? She definitely can\u2019t be trusted to keep clothes nice and clean. \n\nAlso, clothes stretch and wear even with normal use. If I was investing in nicer clothes for the first time, I wouldn\u2019t want someone else wearing them in (and eventually wearing them out).", "That\u2019s the point I\u2019m trying to make, but you did a better job with it. \n\nThe rub is that she can\u2019t trust her sister to keep them nice, unfortunately.", "Then the sister can get her own job. 16 is old enough to work at a retail store or a fast food joint. It is not OP\u2019s responsibility to clothe her sister.\n\nNTA"]}
