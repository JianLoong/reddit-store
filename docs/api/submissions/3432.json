He's lying through his teeth.", "Why on earth would you let someone who drink drives use your car? He's an alcoholic it seems and he is lashing out so now to cover and make you doubt yourself.

Unfortunately a person with an alcoholic problem cannot be believed when they say that they will not drink before driving.", "NTA. But don\u2019t let him take your car anymore. His story of driving home first, then drinking in the car sounds suspicious. And him getting defensive about you finding his bottles in your car is more suspicious. And if he gets in an accident and hurts someone, they might sue you as the car\u2019s owner.", "YTA because you are enabling a drunk with no sense of responsibility to be on the road when you know he has already crashed previously.", "He bought some alcohol and then drove home and then sat in the car outside his home and drank them?  Bollocks.

What the hell are you doing loaning out your car to your friend who clearly has drinking issues? Isn\u2019t a DUI enough of a warning for you? Was his license suspended? Now, to thank you for your naive generosity, he\u2019s leaving  bottles in YOUR car (his sloppy ass can\u2019t even clean up after himself!) and you think his littering is the offense?\n\nJust so you know, alcoholics gaslight others to minimize their addiction. This IS a big deal- he\u2019s not worried about how those bottles affect you (or anyone else). \n\nYour friend needs a 12 step program and the UBER app, not free access to your car, for which you would be liable for if he inevitably crashed it. Your insurance would most likely have to cover the incident, including medical. Oh, wait, do you think your insurance would be pleased to know he\u2019s driving with a DUI charge?

He is trying to gaslight and guilt trip you into feeling bad for calling out his actions that could very well get you in trouble with the law.\n\nThis might be hard, but stop letting him burrow your car. If he's drinking in your car, it's only a matter of time before he either hits another car, gets pulled over or hits a person. And then you'll be also be held responsible to some extent as the owner of the car.\n\nAlso I don't know what the rest of the world is like, but in the US at least the police will hassle you if they find empty bottles of alcohol in your car in like a lunchbox or just plain view. Force you to breathalyze and make you do the sobriety tests. It also gives them an excuse to search your vehicle without your consent because they can use the excuse \"didn't know if it had anything still in it\" due to almost every state having laws against open containers of alcohol in motor vehicles.", "NTA but stop letting him drive your vehicle. Not sure what the law is in your country, but his license may have been suspended or revoked after his DUI. You are not overreacting. He is gaslighting you. He was drinking and driving in your vehicle.", "NTA except for to yourself. Do you really want to be in a relationship with an alcoholic who drives under the influence, also during the day? Do you actually believe he drove home, then drank in the car and left the empty bottles in the car? Why would you risk your car insurance and even the entire car for this asshole? And what if he kills someone the next time he drives drunk, this time with your car?", "So he has no car because of DUI and you still say: suuuure take my car? That is not the smartest thing to do. Him drinking on arrival sounds like a made up excuse because he got busted. Who drinks 3 shots just before entering their home? That does not make sense. It sounds like he has a problem with alcohol. Don\u2019t lend him your car anymore. NTA for acting like you did. And you did not go through his stuff. They were abandoned in your car.", "He's definitely still driving drunk please don't let him use your car again", "NTA  op. He is a big one though, and you are one to yourself for letting someone who has a DUI use it in the first place. He's already proven to be irresponsible behind the wheel.\n\nTell him due to the boozing in your car, he's banned from using it and will have to provide for his own transportation from now on. It's not your problem and letting him use your car again after that stunt is just asking for trouble. He's not trustworthy and has already drank in your car by his own admission.\n\nThat for me would be a deal breaker op. Don't trust him to respect your car or to drive it. Those bottles could have gotten YOU into a lot of trouble.", "They were empty because he drank them IN YOUR CAR. \n\nI mean, let alone having trash in your car, he\u2019s got no car due to a dui, and he\u2019s drinking in yours. So you are clearly NTA. And he\u2019s got some balls to say you\u2019re overreacting.\n \nI will say this\u2026you are slightly TA for even contemplating whether you\u2019re TA here. I can\u2019t even believe you\u2019d loan him a car under those circumstances, let alone wonder if you\u2019re overreacting from him drinking in your car and leaving the trash all over the place.

Maybe you can drive him instead if you're set on helping but letting him drive it just isn't worth the risk", "ESH. You don't mention your friend actually doing anything about their alcohol abuse. I don't know what you were expecting to happen when you let someone who just got a DUI drive your car. Are you even sure he can still legally drive?", "NTA, but don't believe a word that he said. He will say just about anything to cover for his addiction, and gaslight you all the way too. You were crazy to risk your car loaning it to this person. If he hurts or kills someone, it's on YOU. You will be the one getting sued as the owner of the car (insurance) and your insurance may not even cover him driving your car in the first place - many insurances do not cover people who are not in the household of the insured.", "Your mistake is allowing someone with his issues to use your car in the first place. Them being empty in the car means they were consumed in the car which makes it worse. NTA", "As gently as I can say it, **he is lying to you**. He's been drinking while using your car. Your friend is an alcoholic who is not going to stop drinking for anything. You need to take your keys back and stop enabling him before someone dies because of this. \n\nNTA, but you're not going far enough.", "ESH, but only gently for you, because you thought you were doing a nice thing for a friend and had good intentions, but...\n\nYour friend just got a DUI. He clearly has a drinking problem and is not a safe driver. Not only did you risk damage to your car, you risked him drinking and driving and hurting himself or someone else - in your car.\n\nSaying he waited until he got home to drink those bottles is most likely a lie. Because alcoholics lie. \n\nIn case you're in any further doubt that he's an alcoholic, he DARVO'd you. Twisted it around to make it your fault for looking through his things. That is classic alcoholic manipulation and refusal to take responsibility.\n\nYou can't do anything about his drinking problem, but cushioning him from the consequences of his actions by lending him your car is actually enabling it. One of the first guidelines learned, not just in AlAnon but other addiction organisations, is that it is not actually helpful to protect an addict from the consequences of their actions. It just makes it easier for them to continue with the same behaviour.\n\nBut you didn't know, and it looks like you have taken the comments on board and now you do. Just don't try to \"save\" him anymore when he makes further bad choices, that isn't actually what he needs.", "YTA for loaning your car to a known drunk driver.", "You're allowing an attempted murderer to use your car as a weapon and you're worried about how he feels? I think you're too far gone to wake up.
