My dad was a competitive bodybuilder when he was younger.\n\nLast week my dad started showing up to prepare food for Amanda to help her. He doesn't give her a diet, he just prepare the main meals. Both Amanda and my dad were fine with it so I allowed it.\n\nHowever, Amanda started complaining to me about how her food generally taste weird and her omelette has a weird texture to it. So when my dad came over yesterday I went to check what he was doing with the food. My dad always had some weird concoction. When we were younger he gave us onions, pickles and honey if we had any flu. It taste horrendous but he insisted it was good for us.\n\nBut what frightened me was my dad was putting eggshells into my daughter's food. He used the food processor and made it fine before cooking it into the omelette. I felt disgusted and asked what the hell was he doing. I told him that he should at least consult me before putting eggshells in my daughter's food. He got really offended and said that i should be grateful that his helping my daughter. We started arguing and I threw his omelette away. \n\nLater i found out that he was feeding my daughter some raw food as well. For all i know, it should be safe but I thought it was outrageous of him to not consult me on that. \n\nLater that night my mom tried to tell me that it was very rude of me to do that to my dad and I should have been grateful. I've received other not so kind words from my aunt, basically calling me an asshole and for being ungrateful.\n\nSo did I really overreacted and was an asshole?\n\nInfo: he did prepare the eggs correctly but I was just flipping out. To me it felt like my dad took the banana peel out of the trash and cooked it for my daughter.\n\nI agree i can have a different approach which is what I'm going to do. I will go talk to my dad and see if I can set any food boundaries with him.\n\nAs for the comments on my dad starving my kid/putting her on strict diet. His not. Her actual meal doesn't actually stray that much from her usual meals. But sometimes there's weird stuff there like pigs intestine. Amanda still gets her french fries and nuggets every few days. My dad's mainly taking over cause he think cafeteria food isn't nutritious and he also wants Amanda to have a fuller breakfast.

There is nothing wrong with you changing your mind, of course, but don't act like he didn't have your permission. If you wanted to know more details, you should have asked before you allowed anything.  That's not to say you couldn't change your mind, of course, but you should not have started an argument.\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with eggshells, by the way, as long as they're small enough to avoid damaging teeth or soft tissues. They're basically a major calcium boost. Raw foods (assuming meats? I hope you don't have problems with raw veggies) are a bit more iffy and require a lot more care, but can be safe.\n\nBottom line is that you were wrong to give him the go ahead and then acting surprised when you didn't bother to find out what was going on. \n\nThat said, I will stick to my first comment about food safety - if he was feeding her unwashed fresh egg shells or random raw meat from a grocery store, that can be pretty seriously unhealthy. Since you didn't say that anything was unsanitary, I'm assuming that wasn't the problem.", "You're not wrong for being concerned, that needs to be stated upfront.
