So recently Amanda has been getting a interested in athletics sports and was telling my dad(65m) about it. My dad was a competitive bodybuilder when he was younger.\n\nLast week my dad started showing up to prepare food for Amanda to help her. He doesn't give her a diet, he just prepare the main meals. Both Amanda and my dad were fine with it so I allowed it.\n\nHowever, Amanda started complaining to me about how her food generally taste weird and her omelette has a weird texture to it. So when my dad came over yesterday I went to check what he was doing with the food. My dad always had some weird concoction. When we were younger he gave us onions, pickles and honey if we had any flu. It taste horrendous but he insisted it was good for us.\n\nBut what frightened me was my dad was putting eggshells into my daughter's food. He used the food processor and made it fine before cooking it into the omelette. I felt disgusted and asked what the hell was he doing. I told him that he should at least consult me before putting eggshells in my daughter's food. He got really offended and said that i should be grateful that his helping my daughter. We started arguing and I threw his omelette away. \n\nLater i found out that he was feeding my daughter some raw food as well. For all i know, it should be safe but I thought it was outrageous of him to not consult me on that. \n\nLater that night my mom tried to tell me that it was very rude of me to do that to my dad and I should have been grateful. I've received other not so kind words from my aunt, basically calling me an asshole and for being ungrateful.\n\nSo did I really overreacted and was an asshole?", "created_utc": 1682607980, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130q74t/aita_for_throwing_my_dads_food_away_in_front_of/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA, thats just gross why would anyone think it's okay", "NTA\n\nMy biggest concern here is him potentially wrecking her relationship with food.  She is 9 and not an adult competitive body builder.  She should be able to eat the things she likes without being pressured by him, which is what I\u2019m wondering is happening if she went to you to tell you the food was weird instead of him.  \n\nFrom a food safety perspective: eggshells can be absorbed just as readily by our bodies as calcium carbonate powder. People bake the shells then grind them into powder.  Baking to 165 degrees for 10 minutes or more will kill salmonella. \n\nI can\u2019t provide any insight on the raw food part since I\u2019m not sure what food, but holy crap, don\u2019t eat raw pre-ground meat!!!! You could eat a raw steak safely by searing the outside but as soon as it is perforated by grinding or mechanical tenderizing, the surface area for bacterial contamination increases exponentially.  Don\u2019t eat that stuff raw, please!!!\n\nRegardless of food safety science, YOU are her parent. You get to choose.  \n\nHe had kids and made choices for them. You are hers, it\u2019s your decision now.  He needs to follow your choices and everyone else needs to as well.", "NTA - you are the parent, grandparents push boundaries all the time. You should be involved in major diet changes like adding in raw foods and eggshells. Especially because it sounds like your daughter wasn\u2019t a fan (complaining about the taste and texture) and might have felt uncomfortable pushing back against her grandfather. Good job standing up for your kid!", "NTA, it doesn't matter if there is nothing dangerous in the food your dad gave your daughter\u2014he snuck these ingredients in, and she complained to you about it. He is grandpa, not the boss, and he needs to run things by you and defer to your thinking. You told him this, he rebuffed you, and he lost the challenge.", "Eggshell has lots of health benefits - weird as that sounds. So, he wasn't poisoning her he was going heavy on the nutrients. NAH.

I know it sounds strange but you can check, there more research that supports that.\n\nI understand your resistance so I know you reacted in defense of your daughter but maybe better way was to talk to your dad to explain instead blowing up.  He as someone who was in athletic sport has some info you don't and for sure coming from good place because nothing in your post indicate that he is anything but loving grandpa to your kids. I ll go with NAH!", "NTA. i have a cousin who grew up having a weird relationship with food because my uncle was a bodybuilder and fed her and her siblings the way he fed himself. you\u2019re helping your daughter in the long run\u2026.and i also don\u2019t understand his thought process of putting a 9 year old on a bodybuilder\u2019s diet being the first step to help her", "YTA, as long as he was handling/preparing the food safely and hygienically. \n\nYou knew his (relatively odd) food habits and allowed it. There is nothing wrong with you changing your mind, of course, but don't act like he didn't have your permission. If you wanted to know more details, you should have asked before you allowed anything.  That's not to say you couldn't change your mind, of course, but you should not have started an argument.\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with eggshells, by the way, as long as they're small enough to avoid damaging teeth or soft tissues. They're basically a major calcium boost. Raw foods (assuming meats? I hope you don't have problems with raw veggies) are a bit more iffy and require a lot more care, but can be safe.\n\nBottom line is that you were wrong to give him the go ahead and then acting surprised when you didn't bother to find out what was going on. \n\nThat said, I will stick to my first comment about food safety - if he was feeding her unwashed fresh egg shells or random raw meat from a grocery store, that can be pretty seriously unhealthy. Since you didn't say that anything was unsanitary, I'm assuming that wasn't the problem.", "You're not wrong for being concerned, that needs to be stated upfront.  He is more knowledgeable about healthy food intake and he was doing something that had been previously allowed.  From an outside perspective, it seems like you jumped to conclusions instead of asking questions.  It could have been a wonderful time to learn from him, participate in something he and your daughter were bonding over, but instead you saw something you didn't fully understand and you got angry.  Eggshells if cleaned are perfectly safe and healthy.  That remedy he told you is very very old and does a lot of good for your system.", "NTA", "Nta, he should have asked both of you to see if it was ok, not just start yetting the shells and stuff in the food like that, and before someone says something yes he should have asked both of them, since op is the parent and the daughter is the one eating this.", "NTA. Don't let him make food for your daughter. Or any of you. A nine year old is too young for a body builder's regimen.", "Wait wait wait. The family wants you to be grateful that your father is feeding your daughter *COMPOST*? Literal GARBAGE?\n\nNTA. That\u2019s gross and weird.", "ESH. There was a better way for your father to go about this, which included talking to you first and explaining what he was planning to feed your daughter and why. \n\nIt sounds like you overreacted a bit, but I get being weirded out when you learned your data was feeding your daughter something you weren't familiar with. \n\nThat said, your kid is 9. She doesn't need a bodybuilder's diet to do well at soccer or whatever her sport of choice may be.", "YTA.", "YTA, not for being concerned that your daughter is safe - that\u2019s important! That\u2019s good parenting! - but for being so rude to your father who was only trying to help you when you don\u2019t have an iota whether what he was doing ACTUALLY harms your daughter at all. (Newsflash, it doesn\u2019t). \n\nThere were about 500 steps to take between finding out about it and doing what you did, which you missed out. Namely actually FINDING OUT if any harm was done.", "NTA. Eggshells? Is he Trying to give her salmonella?", "NTA. Your daughter said the food tastes weird, so you checked it out. Your dad was doing something weird, and you said no. That should have been the end of it. \n\nBut no. Your dad had to pull the \u2018you should be grateful\u2019. No, no you should not. It\u2019s fantastic he wants to be an active grandparent and it\u2019s fantastic that your daughter wants him around. But her health comes first, and as her parent, it\u2019s your job to safe guard that. Eggshells are not on the approved list of safe foods, and that\u2019s your final decision. \n\nOut of curiosity; was that omelette made with food he bought, or that you did? Because it\u2019s a very weird take to say \u2018you should be grateful\u2019 when your father is in your home, using your kitchen, making food with your ingredients.", "I was curious and did a Google search. Eating eggshells isn't bad for you and actually beneficial due to the calcium and strengthen your bones. \n\nAs a former bodybuilder that's probably why he did it because lifting destroy bones especially if you're doing it at a young age. \n\nWeird....yes.   ok and actually good for you also yes \n\n\nNAH", "I\u2019m not challenging your judgment, as dietary supplements and changes should be transparently discussed before being implemented, but powdered eggshell is a pretty well established calcium supplement for those who are unable to get enough from other sources. Again, OP is NTA, but it\u2019s not as crazy as it may sound.", "LOL then you don't want to watch me eat hard-boiled eggs :-P\n\nThe eggshells and raw food aren't problems in and of themselves, the problem is that the meals are so poorly-prepared that Amanda is complaining about them.", "People pulverize them and don't even notice. I guess some people just crunch and munch their way through them? But, (not that I eat them,) I've seen an old fitness fan do this for years. He's my husband.", "He didn\u2019t \u2018sneak\u2019 anything anywhere. This is a very weird take.", "Sure, you can eat eggshells, but you can't just crack an egg and then use the shells rightaway. You are supposed to boil them, dry them in an owen and then grind them into powder (as far as I know).", "It's still gross though, texture wise. And eggshells can contain bacteria, I literally just watched an info-ed on that. He should have at least asked before potentially risking his grandchild's health", "Don't you think someone should get the parents consent before sneaking a supplement in their child's food?", "He did tho? How is including ingredients in the food that are not normally added to said food, and not letting the kid eating or the parent know that not sneaking??", "Can't like every food contain bacteria?", "Raw egg contains bacteria. That's why we cook eggs generally?", "What are we defining as a supplement? If they fed them an equivalent \"normal\" food with an equal or higher amount of calcium, would you have a problem with that? Should they ask them if they're allowed a glass of milk?", "Did you even read my comment?", "Fine-ground eggshell for calcium is a common bodybuilder trick. If he was being sneaky, he would only do it when she\u2019s NOT watching. He didn\u2019t hide it because it\u2019s not a big deal.", "Oh come off it, if you\u2019d never had jackfruit before and I put it in a salad I made you I\u2019d hardly be \u2018sneaking\u2019 in jackfruit", "Yes but some are higher risk than others, like the outside of eggshells", "Bodybuilder trick, not common average person food trick, and he did hide it, only when he was asked did he tell her what was there.", "But jackfruit is a fruit, not a product that is very commonly thought to be organic waste.", "You would if it\u2019s not a common thing the 9 year old eats", "Yea  on that list I don't think eggs are high on thr list. \n\nI was just pointing out while it's weird it's not unhealthy or dangerous if handled/cooked correctly like any other food", "1. Daughter is getting into athletics, he\u2019s specifically coming over to make her food for body strengthening. That\u2019s explicitly where this all started. \n2. Mom didn\u2019t bother to pay attention until today, so today she learned something. Calcium supplements are not a crime, this is a weird thing to be upset about.", "Well OP said there were raw ingredients so I am not sure if things were cooked properly", "I don't think it's weird to get mad when you aren't informed that someone is feeding your daughter stuff that is widely considered organic waste, regardless of if there's a small group of people attesting to it's value, I still want to know if someone is giving something strange or unusual to my kid.", "You're also not sure if they were cooked properly.", "True but I do think that the parent should have been consulted in any case before adding unconventional ingredients into a child's food.", "Surely the first step is to CHECK before you act like this?"]}
