You are not a AH because your sister lives in this fantasy world where you are going to just pay her bills as well as your own.  You have to look after your family and your are not responsible for your sisters financial mess.... and I am not sure it's the right title for the post. \"AITA for only giving my sister 2 days notice that I was no longer going to be responsible for her bills\" would be a more accurate title....The issue here is why you gave her so little notice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
