I, myself, have a compromised immune system. It really bothers me when people that know this information don't tell me that they or their kids are sick. Compromised immune system aside I find it to be a little disrespectful for someone to not disclose when they're not feeling well and come around. You could get people around you sick, it could interfere with your work...\n\nYou even worded that message very nicely and respectfully. Your friend seems a bit defensive in my opinion.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve liked a heads up on something like this.

It should've been common sense for her to inform you- the people who had contact with her son- that her son is sick. It's irresponsible of her to withhold that information. And if she thinks that you wanting to be informed of her son's health issues directly rather than stumbling upon the information randomly makes you not want to watch him anymore, then you dodged a bullet.", "NTA. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to know?", "Grilled cheese and steamed veggies, which we also had. No allergies that we have ever been made aware of. He's had dairy and wheat at our house before.", "How would what she fed him for lunch affect the people from the night before who were also sick?", "NTA \n\nI would honestly also block her, so if she needs you in the future she can deal with the music alone.", "NTA\nYeesh, that is rough. I feel like a phone call \u201cmight\u201d have been better only because you had basically just seen her hours before and her son is a semi regular at your house because of your niceness and friendship. But I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t want to bother her, honestly I\u2019d probably have gone the texting route too. Plus you offered to make soup! She seems like she\u2019s going through something, that\u2019s my instinct because she was so defensive about her son\u2019s illness (stomach bug, whatever) and basically her language to you told you that she perceived that you were saying she did something wrong, was bad, ignored what should have been done like letting you know. And maybe she feels guilty but also judged by a better more \u201cperfect\u201d mom. And trust me, I\u2019ve felt less perfect over my younger mom years because it always seems like other mom\u2019s have it all down. And I\u2019m sure other moms felt that way occasionally about me at times. I\u2019d say, she\u2019s your friend, make an effort to talk in person and I bet this can be sorted out easily. Being a mom is tough at times as we all know."]}
