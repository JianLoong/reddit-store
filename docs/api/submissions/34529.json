I have been with my now husband for 4 years and recently we found out I'm pregnant. It's a girl. I wasn't supposed to be able to get pregnant, as I had my tubes tied. I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was 5 months, when I started showing. It was just super unexpected. But anyways, since finding out we are going to have a baby and that it's a girl, my husband has been basically trying to get my oldest to share everything. He's not being an ass about it but this definitely didn't start happening until after I found out about the pregnancy. But what pisses me off is that this isn't a matter of him trying to get everyone to share. It's just my oldest. His reasoning is that my 13yo has much nicer stuff than the younger two. My two younger children have a habit of breaking everything, whereas my oldest doesn't. So my 13yo got a $350 gaming headset and a gaming PC for Christmas. But the other two kids got a pair of ear buds ($15) and an Xbox. All other gifts were of equal value.\n\nAnyways, my son wanted to stay at his dad's house after Christmas but my two youngest wanted to come home. I work nights. My husband works from home. I came home at 8am the next morning and found my daughter on my son's brand new gaming PC that he hadn't even used yet. I immediately told her to get off of it. My husband said \"she wasn't hurting anything.\" The next night I found out that my husband let my youngest son sleep in my oldest son's bed (my youngest son's room is colder). Problem is that he wears pullups to bed (ADHD) and left my oldest son's bed smelling like urine and I had no idea until my oldest came home 2 days later. My husband said it wasn't a big deal and that he was just cold and wanted to be more comfortable. \"The bedding can be washed. It's fine.\"\n\nThe tip of the iceberg for me was definitely today. My daughter has already lost her headphones and wanted to use my son's brand new gaming headset. My husband immediately said \"yeah that should be fine.\"  So I stepped in and said \"no\". My husband said, again, \"it's not even a big deal\" when it absolutely is a big deal. And then 2 hours later he told the kids to go outside and told my daughter she could wear my son's snow pants because hers were too small. My daughter is like 4in taller than my son. She can't find her new snow pants that actually fit her. So he wanted my son to wear his sisters snow pants, that are about 2inches too small for even him, so that his sister could wear his and be more comfortable. I snapped. I told him that he only tries getting my son to give up his stuff and doesn't push the same narrative with the other kids and either he stops or he needs to leave. I told him my son will not be forced to share ANYTHING with his siblings and that if the other two would stop losing and breaking their own shit that they wouldn't need to use his. He says I'm being overdramatic and blowing this out of proportion.\n\nedit: formatting\n\nETA: my husband was the baby in the family (out of his 4 siblings) and was spoiled himself so this is a learned behavior I think. I've tried talking to him about it and he admits to wanting my son to share everything because his stuff is nicer and it's not fair to the younger 2. He said I'm spoiling my son and not teaching him the benefit of sharing. He is much closer to my younger kids because they were younger when he came in to the picture. My son is a daddies boy and while he does like his step dad, he made it clear he wasn't interested in a father/son bond because he was already so close to his dad. This topic was only brought up after my husband made a comment that he wanted to be an equal next to my ex and my son was not okay with it. I have spoke to my son about it and he said what irritates him the most is that it's my husband making decisions, not me. In his words, he would be more receptive to me making decisions like that over my husband because my husband is overstepping and needs to take a backseat.

I suspect he wants them to share with the baby, but that makes no sense due to the age gap.  I am really curious about his motivation\u2026.", "NTA. This is such a weird thing for your husband to do. Can you ask him why? Calmly and non-confrontationally? The more expensive stuff in and of itself doesn't make any sense. Was your husband the oldest and always expected to share?

There's more going on here.\n \nSeparately, ask your oldest about his interactions with your husband.

Maybe your husband wants to create a \"perfect family\" and your son doesn't fit that picture?", "Gonna take a shot in th3 dark here and assume that your oldest either looks like or is closer to his dad than the other 2 are? Or at least the younger 2 tend to see your husband as more of an extra dad than he does?\n\nIt looks like your husband has split them up into \"my kids vs. his kids\" (even if none of them are his by blood) in his head.\n\nIt's not at all a surprise that the weird/bad/disrespectful behavior popped up the moment he realized that you were pregnant and thus tied to him more permanently.

Your oldest shouldn't be punished for being more responsible than his siblings.\n\n(I definitely recommend having a private conversation with your son about how your husband treats him when you're not around.)", "NTA.

Good on your for being firm about this. This is isn't even \"sharing,\" it's about letting the younger kids use your son's stuff as much as they want, w/o asking, and it's sure likely they'll end up damaging/breaking the song's things. Yes, he needs to stop or leave.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband is (consciously or not), punishing your oldest for making it clear that he's not his real dad's equal.\n\nThe trigger is your pregnancy. A natural child and two children that are young enough to mould into his image of **all** the kids are his, oldest puts a spoke into his fantasy.\n\nBurn this fantasy down. It'll only get worse if unchecked.\n\nYou'll end up with a son who moves out to his dad's. 2 angry kids, and a spoiled \"golden child\"\" who'll you'll think its \" because she's the youngest too\"\"\n**and that's not really the reason.**", "You are NTA\nI (M36) think you husbands behavior is appalling. \nI don\u2019t think that forcing children to share is bad in general.

I also think it's kinda weird if the oldest suddenly wants to stay at his father's house it's not wrong but maybe he and your husband had a little fight because if he just suddenly started to tell the younger ones that they are allowed to take the things of their older brother then something happened because I know nobody who just goes like \"Oh no! I need to do that instead of that\" I'm not good at explaining sorry.", "NTA. Very concerning and unacceptable behavior from OP\u2019s husband.", "NTA.

You need to shut this down harder now before it escalates.", "Nta\n>either he stops or he needs to leave\n\nYou're right. But I think he's gonna have to leave. He won't stop doing this behind your back. It will alienate your oldest from you and your home. It's gonna come down to choosing your husband or your son. You need to make that decision before your son resents you for letting it go on. You could lose your son over this.\n\nYour husband is the stepparent and he is undermining your parenting to ALL the kids. Telling them they can do things you wouldnt allow. Arguing with you in front of the kids. And he is sowing resentment between the siblings. This isn't acceptable.\n\n\nAre you sure this wasn't going on on a smaller scale before? controlling behaviour tends to escalate during a pregnancy because they feel like the woman is trapped now.\n\nHow pregnant are you now? Personally I would want full resolution before the baby came. You're gonna have enough on your plate without dealing with him doing this, too.", "NTA.  You two need to have a serious sit down pronto about this issue and also how you will parent all of the kids once your baby arrives.  The baby will most definitely change your family dynamic. \n\nYou need to also ask your husband how he intends to parent the baby...this may not have been a conversation you had earlier since the baby is unplanned.

This is about the fact that your asshole husband is jealous and angry that your oldest won't treat him as a father. So he's getting back at him by letting the other kids use your oldest son's stuff all the time. And you know that if they damage it he won't punish them and he'll expect your son to be okay with it.

NTA. Your husband is overstepping and you were/are right to shut this down *now*. Definitely have a conversation with husband about where this is coming from when you're both calm and the kids are elsewhere. It's totally inappropriate what he's doing.

Your oldest son is entitled to his personal space and possessions. Your husband's attempts to force sharing seem to be driven by a desire for perceived equality among the children, but it's unfair to single out one child for this treatment.\r  \n\r  \nIt's crucial to address the issue with your husband, explaining that equality doesn't mean treating every child exactly the same. Each child has unique needs and possessions, and forcing your oldest son to share everything isn't fair to him.", "NTA - If the item belongs to a child, it belongs to that child. It is NOT a shared resource. It is NOT for others to determine who/how it gets used. If your husband wants there to be shared headphones and consoles, he should actually procure them and put them into service.\n \nMy parents made me share my toys with my younger brothers. Of course when they broke my toy, that was on me. So I learned that sharing means all the risk is on me and none on the person borrowing. I don't share well to this day.", "NTA, but: \n\n>  I told him that he only tries getting my son to give up his stuff and doesn't push the same narrative with the other kids and either he stops or he needs to leave. \n\nThis was the wrong way to approach it. You need to make it clear to him that he needs to grow into the role of a co-parent of his stepchildren, and that he needs to defer to you until you give him clearance to assert these decisions on his own. \n\nThere are perfectly good reasons that a 13 year old won't want to share their personal items with much younger children. You know those reasons, because you've been parenting these kids for years. Your husband does not, because he's ignorant. He needs to acknowledge this truth and behave accordingly.\n\nEDIT: Based on other information posted by OP, I'm revising this advice. It seems that her pregnancy with their shared child has given the husband the confidence to start outright bullying the older stepchild, presumably because that stepchild doesn't regard him as a father. The husband has shown the ability to co-parent effectively in the past, and is now going rogue. \n\nOP, your husband is becoming the evil stepparent, and he will drive your older child away. Once that stepchild is gone, he may come around to the younger stepchildren too.

I had a strict rule with my kids that they never touch anything that wasn't theirs without permission of the one who owned it.\n\nYour husband is basically saying that your son's feelings don't matter and he probably doesn't like him. I'd insist on counseling. If you don't stop this you will lose your oldest son because he tolerance for what is happening will drop over time and he will go stay with his dad where he feels wanted and valued. \n\nYour younger kids will also have nice things when they learn to not destroy what they have.", "I agree with your son. Your husband isn't being a fair father to him and probably taking it out on him that he's not equal to the dad", "NTA it seems like he is either trying to push your older some out or trying to force him to share in a deluded attempt to create a more parental older sibling relationship so that he will be more receptive to looking after the baby. I honestly don\u2019t think your husband likes the boundaries that the youngest has about their possessions and he is trying to break the boundaries. \n\nYou husband and you need some couples therapy and have a talk with your sons to find out if Luther things have happened and how he\u2019s feeling.", "Your husband is definitely a shitty father.

If husband wants to continue offering up oldest's items without ASKING him, he needs to state in a written agreement with you that he will replace any damaged items with same or higher value. Pissed in mattress & sheets? replaced. Busted headphones? replaced. \n\n2.

Oldest should be \"respectful of the adult tasked with supervising\" but not in that archaic \"blindly respect your elders\" way\n\n3. It may do well to have a sit down with the two to clear the air and set up some hard boundaries with you as a mediator. That or a counselor who is not biased, but he's your son and he's stated his point on the \"dad\" thing.

I love my siblings however they are too young to properly care for my belongings with the care I give them. If I was asked, of course I don\u2019t want my sister to be cold but the consequences of losing her new snow pants is that she may have to spend time looking for them when she could\u2019ve been playing. Next time, I\u2019ll watch younger brother outside while they are searched for with your help\u201d \n\n2. Step Dad - \u201cWhile I may not be your father, I have signed up to be a partner to your mother in life and that includes doing my best to be a supportive Step Dad and assist in raising you all to be good people. My perspective of that includes excessive sharing due how I was raised, however I am not the oldest and my experience is not yours.

Life isn't necessarily equal, but what your oldest child and you are wanting is absolutely fair. You need to nip this in the bud now with hubby.
