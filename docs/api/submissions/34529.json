I have been with my now husband for 4 years and recently we found out I'm pregnant. It's a girl. I wasn't supposed to be able to get pregnant, as I had my tubes tied. I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was 5 months, when I started showing. It was just super unexpected. But anyways, since finding out we are going to have a baby and that it's a girl, my husband has been basically trying to get my oldest to share everything. He's not being an ass about it but this definitely didn't start happening until after I found out about the pregnancy. But what pisses me off is that this isn't a matter of him trying to get everyone to share. It's just my oldest. His reasoning is that my 13yo has much nicer stuff than the younger two. My two younger children have a habit of breaking everything, whereas my oldest doesn't. So my 13yo got a $350 gaming headset and a gaming PC for Christmas. But the other two kids got a pair of ear buds ($15) and an Xbox. All other gifts were of equal value.\n\nAnyways, my son wanted to stay at his dad's house after Christmas but my two youngest wanted to come home. I work nights. My husband works from home. I came home at 8am the next morning and found my daughter on my son's brand new gaming PC that he hadn't even used yet. I immediately told her to get off of it. My husband said \"she wasn't hurting anything.\" The next night I found out that my husband let my youngest son sleep in my oldest son's bed (my youngest son's room is colder). Problem is that he wears pullups to bed (ADHD) and left my oldest son's bed smelling like urine and I had no idea until my oldest came home 2 days later. My husband said it wasn't a big deal and that he was just cold and wanted to be more comfortable. \"The bedding can be washed. It's fine.\"\n\nThe tip of the iceberg for me was definitely today. My daughter has already lost her headphones and wanted to use my son's brand new gaming headset. My husband immediately said \"yeah that should be fine.\"  So I stepped in and said \"no\". My husband said, again, \"it's not even a big deal\" when it absolutely is a big deal. And then 2 hours later he told the kids to go outside and told my daughter she could wear my son's snow pants because hers were too small. My daughter is like 4in taller than my son. She can't find her new snow pants that actually fit her. So he wanted my son to wear his sisters snow pants, that are about 2inches too small for even him, so that his sister could wear his and be more comfortable. I snapped. I told him that he only tries getting my son to give up his stuff and doesn't push the same narrative with the other kids and either he stops or he needs to leave. I told him my son will not be forced to share ANYTHING with his siblings and that if the other two would stop losing and breaking their own shit that they wouldn't need to use his. He says I'm being overdramatic and blowing this out of proportion.\n\nedit: formatting\n\nETA: my husband was the baby in the family (out of his 4 siblings) and was spoiled himself so this is a learned behavior I think. I've tried talking to him about it and he admits to wanting my son to share everything because his stuff is nicer and it's not fair to the younger 2. He said I'm spoiling my son and not teaching him the benefit of sharing. He is much closer to my younger kids because they were younger when he came in to the picture. My son is a daddies boy and while he does like his step dad, he made it clear he wasn't interested in a father/son bond because he was already so close to his dad. This topic was only brought up after my husband made a comment that he wanted to be an equal next to my ex and my son was not okay with it. I have spoke to my son about it and he said what irritates him the most is that it's my husband making decisions, not me. In his words, he would be more receptive to me making decisions like that over my husband because my husband is overstepping and needs to take a backseat.

There's more going on here.\n \nSeparately, ask your oldest about his interactions with your husband.

Maybe your husband wants to create a \"perfect family\" and your son doesn't fit that picture?", "Gonna take a shot in th3 dark here and assume that your oldest either looks like or is closer to his dad than the other 2 are? Or at least the younger 2 tend to see your husband as more of an extra dad than he does?\n\nIt looks like your husband has split them up into \"my kids vs. his kids\" (even if none of them are his by blood) in his head.\n\nIt's not at all a surprise that the weird/bad/disrespectful behavior popped up the moment he realized that you were pregnant and thus tied to him more permanently.

Good on your for being firm about this.

I also think it's kinda weird if the oldest suddenly wants to stay at his father's house it's not wrong but maybe he and your husband had a little fight because if he just suddenly started to tell the younger ones that they are allowed to take the things of their older brother then something happened because I know nobody who just goes like \"Oh no! I need to do that instead of that\" I'm not good at explaining sorry.", "NTA. Very concerning and unacceptable behavior from OP\u2019s husband.", "NTA.

You need to shut this down harder now before it escalates.", "Nta\n>either he stops or he needs to leave\n\nYou're right. But I think he's gonna have to leave. He won't stop doing this behind your back. It will alienate your oldest from you and your home. It's gonna come down to choosing your husband or your son. You need to make that decision before your son resents you for letting it go on. You could lose your son over this.\n\nYour husband is the stepparent and he is undermining your parenting to ALL the kids. Telling them they can do things you wouldnt allow. Arguing with you in front of the kids. And he is sowing resentment between the siblings. This isn't acceptable.\n\n\nAre you sure this wasn't going on on a smaller scale before? controlling behaviour tends to escalate during a pregnancy because they feel like the woman is trapped now.\n\nHow pregnant are you now? Personally I would want full resolution before the baby came. You're gonna have enough on your plate without dealing with him doing this, too.", "NTA.  You two need to have a serious sit down pronto about this issue and also how you will parent all of the kids once your baby arrives.  The baby will most definitely change your family dynamic. \n\nYou need to also ask your husband how he intends to parent the baby...this may not have been a conversation you had earlier since the baby is unplanned.

This is about the fact that your asshole husband is jealous and angry that your oldest won't treat him as a father. So he's getting back at him by letting the other kids use your oldest son's stuff all the time. And you know that if they damage it he won't punish them and he'll expect your son to be okay with it.

NTA. Your husband is overstepping and you were/are right to shut this down *now*. Definitely have a conversation with husband about where this is coming from when you're both calm and the kids are elsewhere. It's totally inappropriate what he's doing.

Your oldest son is entitled to his personal space and possessions. Your husband's attempts to force sharing seem to be driven by a desire for perceived equality among the children, but it's unfair to single out one child for this treatment.\r  \n\r  \nIt's crucial to address the issue with your husband, explaining that equality doesn't mean treating every child exactly the same.

If your husband wants there to be shared headphones and consoles, he should actually procure them and put them into service.\n \nMy parents made me share my toys with my younger brothers.

If husband wants to continue offering up oldest's items without ASKING him, he needs to state in a written agreement with you that he will replace any damaged items with same or higher value. Pissed in mattress & sheets? replaced. Busted headphones? replaced. \n\n2. Hubby can't come in and be equal obviously BUT there should be some standard ground rules as he IS taking on as a secondary/bonus parent through marriage. Oldest should be \"respectful of the adult tasked with supervising\" but not in that archaic \"blindly respect your elders\" way\n\n3. It may do well to have a sit down with the two to clear the air and set up some hard boundaries with you as a mediator. That or a counselor who is not biased, but he's your son and he's stated his point on the \"dad\" thing. Maybe your husband can also offer insight into his line of thinking but I feel your son may be the more mature one in this conversation and can be prepped for a emotionally intelligent rebuttal as to why \u201cbabying everyone by mistreating him is wrong\u201d\n\nNote: When I say boundaries, I mean the literal definition of them in the, \"If you do this, then I will not engage - these are my personal limits of engagement\u201d and not in the \u201cif you say you don\u2019t like the jeans I picked out, I\u2019m giving you the silent treatment\u201d way. A few examples:\n\n1. Son - \u201cIf you continue to offer my personal items without asking my permission or communicating with me why my permission was superseded, especially while I\u2019m at my dad\u2019s, I will stop giving my permission for any of my belongings to be shared and any continued sharing will result in damage to our relationship and a decline in my trust of you. I love my siblings however they are too young to properly care for my belongings with the care I give them. If I was asked, of course I don\u2019t want my sister to be cold but the consequences of losing her new snow pants is that she may have to spend time looking for them when she could\u2019ve been playing. Next time, I\u2019ll watch younger brother outside while they are searched for with your help\u201d \n\n2. Step Dad - \u201cWhile I may not be your father, I have signed up to be a partner to your mother in life and that includes doing my best to be a supportive Step Dad and assist in raising you all to be good people. My perspective of that includes excessive sharing due how I was raised, however I am not the oldest and my experience is not yours. How can we bridge this gap together where I can support you but still feel that there is fairness with your siblings as well?\u201d - and guess how this is going to go? If your hubby has been \u201cbonus dad\u201d for your younger kids? Outline with him some ways he can provide consequences for the younger kids if they do something that requires \u201csharing (read: stealing/unfairly borrowing)\u201d eldest\u2019s items.

If these, at the minute, minor things don't get rectified quickly, then I don't want to blow things out of proportion but your son will see living with his dad a better solution than dealing with your husbands BS.", "So your newborn needs a phone because your oldest has one? And she needs a car as a toddler because her half-brother gets his driver's license by then? Your husband is an AH", "Trying to push him away so he stays with his bio dad?!", "He\u2019s been overstepping for two months, at your child\u2019s expense to the point that your son is resentful that you allow him to make those decisions.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re sticking up for your kid \nbut You should still  kick him out for a few days so he can get his head on straight and stop trying to push your little boy away . \n\nBut I think your husband already sees your boy as the enemy here.\n\nYour husband getting upset that your son Won\u2019t look at him as equal to his bio father was the first Red Flag OP.", "Since it is your house I think you can tell him that your house must be a safe space for all of your children. He is making it unsafe for your son and that has to stop. If he continues doing the things he is doing he will have to leave. Even if he does it just one more time he has to leave. I know he can refuse to leave and then you would have to go through an eviction. \n\nI would emphasize that he is welcome to purchase, with his own money, equal items for the two younger children if it is that important to him. If that is his standard he should be willing to spend his money on it. If he refuses to put his money where his mouth is I'd tell him that I was disappointed that he is so willing to throw away what your older son has but not willing to do the same with what he has.", "You know... Now that you mention it.. back maybe a year ago he did say \"sometimes I wish I could just adopt the kids. I dont like this house feeling so empty when they're gone.\" I didn't think anything of it.", "Not at all harsh imho! This stepfather will ruin the family and try to blame the child if he continues with this crap.", "Yeah, what is this guy\u2019s deal?", "Ok. I also have a kid with adhd and a family full of parents, siblings, all with different adhd versions and I\u2019ve never heard of this. \n\nI would be more concerned with your husband\u2019s behaviour and the connection that could be made to your youngest bedwetting. It is common for the oldest child to be alienated, pushed out of the home while the younger are groomed and given special treatment. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "This has only happened in the last 2 months.", "I *think* (and OP please correct me if wrong) \"he doesn't interfere, he simply tries\" means OP only views it as interfering if she didn't correct it. Like of she let her daughter continue using her brothers stuff instead of immediately stopping it, but since she did stop it its only an attempt at interfering. He is still interfering though, just maybe not the obvious way. He's being the fun parent and making you the bad guy who always takes away their fun shit, so he's hurting your relationship with your kids and their relationship with their brother.", "Because he refuses to leave his door open for heat to get inside. He doesn't want people in his room, so he closes his door. I've told him not to several times, on the basis alone that it needs to get heated in there.", "The favoritism shit is real. The kids notice and it's flat out wrong. I was married to a guy with 2 kids. I had 2. He had no problem giving his kids stuff l couldn't afford to give mine. He saw no problem with it. My kids hate him. We're not married anymore.", "\u201cPrivate property is private property\u201d\n\nYES! This needs to be taught to kids at a young age. If another kid doesn\u2019t want to share, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s all about boundaries. The earlier kids learn this lesson the better.", "From OP\u2019s statements, it almost sounds like this guy is trying to cause division\u2026", "Yeah that was the 1st one for me too.\n\nWho tells a kid 'I want to be treated just like your dad is by you', especially when the other parent is an active and involved person in their lives? I wonder how long into the kids knowing him this was said, because if it was at the beginning, no wonder 13 has his back up with him.", "He wants to be the ONLY dad in their lives and to do that he needs to get rid of the one kid that doesn\u2019t want that .\n\nThe more you talk about your husband the more upset I am that you haven\u2019t kicked him to the curb over this already.", "The bedwetting started long before my husband was around. My kids aren't being groomed.", "Yeah I suppose since you are pregnant, but don't you see what he is doing ? Slowly but surely ? 2 months is already too much, he needs to stay in his place, I think he resent your older because he is much close to his dad and distant from him but it's not fair to your child. I wish you good luck for the future because you already asked him many times to not interfere but he does not respect your wish..", "Has it changed/worsened any since finding out you're pregnant?", "Yeah, I mean he truly did not do this before I got pregnant. Every time he wanted to make a decision about the kids he came to me first and included me so I wasn't blindsided. He doesn't even discuss anything with me anymore (since finding out I'm pregnant). Now it's met with a \"well in my opinion\" whenever I bring any of it up with him either about how he's changed.", "Sounds like he feels like he\u2019s got you locked in now with the pregnancy and can walk all over you and do what he wants because of it. \n\nYou\u2019re right to nip this in the bud now, it will only get worse if you don\u2019t.", "Maybe now that you're pregnant with your kids half sibling and his bio child he feels he's more of a parent than a step parent and thus has more say?\n\nHonestly you may want to sit down and talk to him about how letting the youngest kids use your oldest's stuff and probably ruining some of it is going to make your oldest resent him and his siblings, especially since they don't have to share. Talk to him about the long term effects and try to relate to him (\"what if your mother let your sibling use your brand new gift before you got it, or let your bed smell like piss and didn't seem to care?\") \n\nIf that doesn't work, I recommend couples counseling.", "Honestly op with your older kids you need to put your foot down with him and make it clear he\u2019s not their parent. If he\u2019s not going to show you the respect of being the parent then his opinion isn\u2019t wanted. No more overstepping on his part. Otherwise he\u2019s gonna just keep going and ignore your boundaries", "This is way past couples counciling. She\u2019s warned him several times, I\u2019d tell him next time he does it he\u2019s kicked out. NTA, but you will be to your eldest if you let his step father continue this way."]}
