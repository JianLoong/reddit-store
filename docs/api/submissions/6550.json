Her and I have had a very healthy relationship however recently something happened that I feel I may be an asshole for. Ok so for context my girlfriend is Persian and Black, her parents and her are a rocky with her. They obviously love her but they aren't the most affectionate with each other. Her father would pull diamond with his bare hand just so his daughter could have the best jewelry. She is their only child so it makes sense that they'd be protective of her. I am a white man from Florida so there are somethings that her family does that doesn't make sense to me but I try to be open minded. \n\nNow for the story, so a couple days ago me and my girlfriend got into an argument. I won't say what about but it got pretty heated and ended in her storming out and staying with her parents. Well the next morning she came back and things were obviously tense and I ended up going to work without speaking to her. When I got back she was cutting fruits. Like a lot of them. I didn't think much of it and just went into my room. Eventually she knocked on the door and upon opening it she was standing there with a plate of fruit. I asked her what she was doing and she says \" it's for you\" I was still mad from our previous fight and just asked her \" are you not going to talk to be about yesterday? Or even apologize?\" to which she replied \" this is an apology?\" holding up the fruit again. I ended up telling her that's not a real apology and that in the real world we speak about situations not gift our way out of them. I heard her crying in the kitchen after and started to feel bad about what I said but at the time I truly thought that I was in the right. Well this morning her friend called asking how I could be so cruel to her. I was confused and at first thought my girlfriend skewed the story but then her friend explained that people in my girlfriends culture regularly apologize that way and that my girlfriend likely grew up receving cut fruit and foods after arguments with her family. Her and my girlfriends family have been chewing me out but I really just don't know. What if her friend is lying about the whole culture thing to make me feel bad? I've asked my family and they are on my side and also believe that the fruit thing wasnt a real apology. I still came on here to ask since i am a frequent reddit user. So AITA? Should I have just excepted her \"apology \" and moved on?", "created_utc": 1672925074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103yvg9/aita_for_not_taking_my_girlfriends_apology/", "score": 307, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one needs to accept an apology, but if you\u2019re asking whether you\u2019re the asshole for refusing to accept what you consider not to be an apology but are willing to accept an apology only on your terms, yes, YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt is a thing in Western culture as well, it's called a peace offering.\n\nPlus the gesture was way more than you did. You gave her the silent treatment, avoided her and didn't make an effort to reconcile. She thought of you and came to you to reconcile and you just snapped at her.\n\nWhere was your apology huh?", "Wanting to talk about it is natural, but(rudely) brushing of a clear attempt at reconciliation makes you an ah. Even more so when you HEARD HER CRYING and did fuck all to console her. Yta", "I'm not seeing where she was wrong.  As such, YTA\n\nShe didn't outright apologize, but she was setting the stage for tensions to be eased so it wouldn't be heated conversation.  Clearly she's making an effort, and doing so effectively I might add.  What did you do to ease the tension?  Give her the silent treatment?  \n\nShe diffused the situation.  You poured gasoline all over it.  You tried to take her dignity.  \"Unless you come in here and grovel and use these specific words, I'm entitled to act like an ass with impunity.\"  \n\nShe made vastly more of an effort than you did.  You bulldozed right over her apology, and are now trying to claim \"Oh, that's not a *real* apology.\"  There's a time and a place for that line, but this ain't it.  YTA\n\nOh, you didn't apologize either.  Let's not forget that in all of this.", "Yeah, yta for not even trying to understand her culture.\n\nJust because it isn't an apology for typical FLORIDA MAN doesn't mean it's not how her family or culture does things.\n\nAmericans aren't the only ones.\n\nAlso, why does she have to approach you? You're in the relationship too.\n\nGrow up.", "YTA\n\nYou've been dating for 3 years? You clearly haven't made much effort to learn about her culture. \nJust because it was unknown to you, the way you reacted was uncalled for and disrespectful.\n\n>I am a white man from Florida so there are somethings that her family does that doesn't make sense to me but I try to be open minded.\n\nYou don't sound very open minded to me.\nApologize and do better or you may not have a girlfriend for much longer", "YTA\n\nAmericans are aware of what a peace offering or an olive branch is. I have a feeling you are in the wrong for your argument too but don\u2019t want to admit it.", "\u201cWhat if her friend is lying about the whole culture thing to make me feel bad?\u201d Wow you sound like a really fantastic boyfriend. Because that\u2019s a completely reasonable thing to think. /s\nYou clearly have access to the internet so a quick google isnt beyond your ability yet you\u2019re here and you didn\u2019t even see that particular line of thinking as unreasonable. I can only IMAGINE what parts of yourself as a partner you\u2019re choosing to leave out when there\u2019s so much questionable stuff you thought was fine to admit to. YTA", "YTA.  The fruit was the gateway to the conversation you wanted and you just slammed that door closed in your girlfriend's face.  While in different cultures the fruit can be taken different ways, it wasn't necessarily the actual point. The point is that your girlfriend was trying to apologize in her known method, you had the opportunity to take it and then transform the act into a conversation to resolve things which you failed miserably.  Also, if you don't believe the tradition for your gf culture, you could do some research on Google to see if it's true or not.", "YTA you could have accepted her gift and then talked about it. Why did it have to be one or the other.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nEven if you didn't know about her cultural custom of being fruit as a way of apology or its a lie, you should know an olive branch when you see one. \n\nThere was a way to accept what she was giving you and discussing what had happened in a calm, mature way. Her giving you the plate of fruit was an easy way to come back together and you acted like a bit of a jerk because you were still heated.", "Come on man, of course YTA.  Regardless of how she's doing it she's trying to apologize and make peace but you just shut her down because she's not putting the specific bow you want on the apology..  You also knowing that there's an obvious cultural difference but trying to act paranoid about it like there's some big Persian conspiracy that her family and girlfriend are cooking up to pull the wool over your eyes makes you an even bigger AH.\n\nIs this not better than her not apologizing?  Or wanting to hold on to the argument and keep the fight going?\n\nLighten up, meet her in the middle and apologize yourself.", "YTA - A lot of people might call you out for the cultural reasons but I am going to focus on you disregarding her efforts. She brought you a plate of fruit and all you needed to do was to say thank you and move on. If you wanted to talk about what happened that is fine, but you the way you went about it was uncalled for. \n\nAlso by your standards what constitutes a real apology? Does she have to verbally tell you?", "Taking time to make food for someone is a pretty common way of apologizing in my book, and I'm a white European. I understand it is probably more prominent in her culture, but it's not unheard of in general. \n\nYTA, I think you just wanted an explicit apology instead and disregarded all her effort.", "She clearly felt bad if she cried after just wanting to bring you something to make up for what she saw as her possibly overreacting when walking out. You could have very easily taken the plate of fruit, thanked her for it, then asked if you could talk about the fight you had previously if you were still upset over it. YTA", "YTA to the point where I think she'd better off without you in her life, because you are clearly not open to her culture because somehow it is not how things are done in your version of the 'real world'.You chose not to speak to her the next morning (*'I'* ended up going to work without speaking to her) and then complain because she did something nice for you instead of 'talking things out'.  And even when you are told that was her way of apologizing, you hold out.  Why?  Because she might be trying to trick you?  Is your ego that fragile?", "YTA. She said that was her apology, you could at least be gracious enough to receive it. Not an AH for explaining to her, how you would prefer an apology. Cultural understanding and open-mindedness go both ways.", "YTA oof you scare me dude", "YTA\n\nThe fruit wasn't an apology, it was an ice breaker. You sit down with each other, eat some fruit, stop freezing each other out, and start talking. Jesus, dude. Have some flexibility here. The conversation doesn't have to happen in the real world exactly the way you imagined it. It just needs to be allowed to happen. Did you think that cut fruit meant that the subject is closed, and there can be no more discussion on it? \"AHA! You ate the cantaloupe, so I never wanna hear another word about me banging your brother behind the dumpster of that Wendy's!\"\n\nWhat if it were a hug instead of fruit? Would that also have been \"not an apology\"? That's like THE go-to apology starter. Bringing you shit is pretty universally seen as a close second, believe it or not. Unless this fight was about something incredibly fucked up that she did to you, then you're seriously fucking up by acting this way. \n\nMaking up after a fight boils down to one question: Do you want to be together or not? When you answer that question for yourself, you take steps to ensure the outcome you want. Don't just pout, fuckin' do something. If you think you're owed an apology and owe none yourself, think again. Then again. If you still think it's 100% on her, and you still want to be together, then you're gonna have to get past the issue in your own mind, get over yourself, and tell tour ego to shut the fuck up. Then talk to her. \n\nIf (and this is always *far* more likely) there are things you can apologize for as well, then *do that*. Whether their actions justified it or not, saying or doing things that hurt your partner should make you feel bad, and you should apologize for them. From a purely pragmatic perspective, this tactic is very often reciprocated, and you both end up getting exactly what you want. It's like magic. You're supposed to be a team. Act like it.", "The thing is, anyone can say sorry. Showing you're sorry is more meaningful. It takes a lot more effort to prep a giant plate of fruit than it does to say the words. \n\nShe sounds amazing. Why are you thinking anyone would lie to you about cultural norms and why wouldn't you just appreciate the effort?\n\nYTA.", "I\u2019m failing to see how this argument come from a couple with \u2018a very healthy relationship\u2019.\n\nNothing more to add to what others has mentioned about olive branch/peace offerings. Verdict: YTA.", "YTA. Forget whether fruits are a traditional apology, it doesn't even affect the situation. She made an effort. You insulted her. Ergo, you're the problem here. You're the one that rejected what was supposed to be an apology and insulted the person giving it. This is an absolute no go in **your own** Christian cultural background. It's also the absolute opposite of what you said. You talked about communication and then buried any chance at it 20 feet underground. \n\nGet your head out of your ass and follow your own advice: first apologize, then communicate. Because I assure you everyone she's talking to is telling her not to try again and just wait to see wether you can unbury yourself from the hill you already died on.", "YTA. She made an effort. You continued to be hostile. When my husband and I get in a petty fight where neither of us was really \u201cwrong\u201d I will often do a small kind gesture after we both cool off. It opens the door to a discussion.", "YTA dude, you could have easily used her apology to start the dialogue for talking about what happened.", "YTA. \n\nGoggle it. Fruit offered as an apology is a thing. \n\nIf I were you, I would combine cultures by getting her a big fancy fruit arrangement, then verbally say you are sorry for not understanding her culture quickly enough. \n\nEdible Arrangements even has an \u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d fruit arrangement that can be delivered to your home. If you live in the US.", "YTA. She came in to reconcile and you shot it down unilaterally. And yes giving you cut fruit is a thing in some cultures. \n\nDo better.", "YTA. \n\nSo you didn't take any initiative to apologize or clear the air, but held your girlfriend to higher standard than what you would do yourself. \n\nYou left for work without speaking to her, you came home and went to the room without speaking to her, she came in with clearly a gesture of good will to OPEN the conversation, and you rejected her gesture and demanded an apology. \n\nYOU did absolutely nothing to fix the fight. And then have the nerve to tell her \"in the real world we speak about our situations\" but you never tried to speak about it. So how were you planning on fixing the situation? When were you planning to speak about it?", "YTA hope she dumps you!", "Okay so I\u2019m Persian and it is a thing. We use food, and particularly fruit, to show our love. It\u2019s very common for parents/grandparents to present large platters of cut up fruit to their children/grandchildren as a gesture of love and affection. Personally one of my favorite ways to say and receive an \u201cI love you\u201d is through food/cut up fruit. \n\nBUT even if it wasn\u2019t a thing. Even if it was just her thing, YTA. Like others have said this was a peace offering. When someone is showing you that they\u2019re willing to put their swords down and raise the white flag you don\u2019t then fight over terms right away, you also put your weapons down and prepare to start to mend things. \n\nYou need to learn to set your anger and pride aside if you want to be in a healthy relationship. That\u2019s what she did, she cut up a ton of fruit and came to you because she was putting her pride aside and preparing to repair things but you decided that you needed to tear her down just a little bit more to make yourself feel good.", "YTA\n\nYou have could said \u201cI\u2019m confused by the fruit. Could we talk this out instead?\u201d Or \u201cSure, we can nibble on fruit while we talk. Let\u2019s go sit down\u201d", "INFO: You have been together for 3 years and have never fought before?", "Yta,  she apologized in the way she knows how to. I stead of lashing out you could have gently explained why you were upset and how to discuss it moving forward", "YTA\n\nNot because you want to talk it out, but because she was clearly showing effort and you shut her down rudely. Could've just accepted the offer and asked if she wanted to talk about what happened.. Instead you insulted her \"in the real world we talk about what happened\". A-grade for making her feel like shit when she was trying to do something nice. \n\nNote: imo it's not even culture-related. My bf brings me tea sometimes after an argument just as a sign of good will and open up for conversation.", "My dad often gave me small gifts, like making a hot chocolate or cutting up some fruit (from the uk) after an argument if he was wrong. But it wasn\u2019t the full apology and we would try and communicate afterwards about what happened. \n\nThe real question OP is if you got angry straight away or if you gave your girlfriend a chance to speak first and then noticed she didn\u2019t intend to talk about the situation.", "YTA - All you had to do was say that you didn't know it was a form of apology, accept the apology, apologize yourself, and even ask about the tradition...that opens up for you to talk about what you did growing up. Communication is a great thing...instead you decided to say \"in the real world we speak about situations\" which is just petty and a little ironic since you chose not to speak about why she chose to do this instead since you didn't understand.", "YTA I don't understand how this is the first time this has ever come up in three years. If someone apologizes in a way you don't like you're allowed to discuss it with them, but in my opinion you were way too aggressive here.\n\nIt may depend on the content of the argument but I don't understand why she's the one who has to come grovelling to you? You're both in a relationship, you were both arguing, you should both want to resolve conflicts in a kind manner and seek to apologize if things get really heated. As a side note, don't use the silent treatment, it's childish", "YTA, gently. It was perfectly reasonable for you to want to discuss what the argument was about. She was making a peace offering and you should have accepted that. It would\u2019ve been perfectly fine to say. You both needed to work out with the problem was and resolve it, but you appreciate her conciliatory offering. You don\u2019t see what the argument was about or whether possibly, you might also owe her an apology.", "[removed]", "Florida man gets angry at girlfriend for apologizing to him because it came with a free snack. \nYTA.", "YTA, she was doing an apology based on Persian culture.  Get a clue.", "YTA. The fact you never learned about her culture enough, or when she gave you a plate of food and told you she was apologizing with it is very telling. You prefer to doubt her and her entire culture then actually asking her about this.", "YTA. \n\nWhat was said that made her want to leave?\n\nYou could have started a conversation yourself instead of sulking in your room. She tried to make peace and you decided to stay mad, that's not a good sign for the future.", "You can want a constructive apology but it's the way you say and do things.\nShe attempted to ease the tension, why couldn't you at least listen or ask for space if you didn't feel ready to talk? Relationships are not easy , specially with different backgrounds but they definitely need grace, patience and understanding. Looks like you'll be cutting ties or fruit in the upcoming days.", "YTA. I understand the desire to talk it out, but that is a legitimate way to apologize. I'm Asian, and it's pretty common in our culture. \n\n>I ended up telling her that's not a real apology and that in the real   \nworld we speak about situations not gift our way out of them.\n\nYou're TA for this. You implied that she has no awareness about the real world and that because of her relationship with her parents (I'm guessing gift-giving was the main form of affection), she doesn't know how to deal with adult life. Ultimately it's a cruel way to say it. \n\nYou could've acknowledged her apology and asked to talk it out as well. Intercultural relationships require intercultural ways of connecting. Plus, what the hell would your family know about apologies from a culture they're not part of?", "You could have viewed the fruit as a peace offering and a chance to get back to neutral and have the conversation you wanted to have. Your girlfriend showed vulnerability and you reacted with hostility, and as a result nobody got what they wanted. \n\nYTA because you assumed the worst and jumped to conclusions when you probably could have had the communication you wanted AND some fruit.", "YTA. I don't even think this is a cultural issue. She (quite literally) opened the door to conflict resolution. Just because she's holding a plate of fruit doesn't mean the conversation ends there and all is forgiven. An OlIvE bRaNcH? i WaNtEd An ApOloGy!

Her and I have had a very healthy relationship however recently something happened that I feel I may be an asshole for. Ok so for context my girlfriend is Persian and Black, her parents and her are a rocky with her. They obviously love her but they aren't the most affectionate with each other. Her father would pull diamond with his bare hand just so his daughter could have the best jewelry. She is their only child so it makes sense that they'd be protective of her.

I won't say what about but it got pretty heated and ended in her storming out and staying with her parents. Well the next morning she came back and things were obviously tense and I ended up going to work without speaking to her. When I got back she was cutting fruits. Like a lot of them. I didn't think much of it and just went into my room. Eventually she knocked on the door and upon opening it she was standing there with a plate of fruit. I asked her what she was doing and she says \" it's for you\" I was still mad from our previous fight and just asked her \" are you not going to talk to be about yesterday? Or even apologize?\" to which she replied \" this is an apology?\" holding up the fruit again.

You shut it down before she would have been able to even get that far. Even I, who really have no culture to speak of, would think a thoughtful gesture to start with, would be completely acceptable. Sure, a verbal apology is what you were looking for, but you didn't even allow her to try. It's highly likely this was just a segue into the verbal apology. But I suppose now you'll never know because you shit on it before she even spoke! Maybe when she said \"this is the apology\" she meant \"this fruit plate is how I will get my foot in the door to apologize\". Haven't you ever heard of people showing up with flowers or something when they are apologizing? Not really different when it's a fruit plate.

In my culture our parents sometimes apologise by moving on and treating you nice, like giving fruit, making food you like or just even talking nicely. I love my mom but it\u2019s usually made me feel more hurt than anything else. Returning to affection is fine but an apology takes communication. \n\nIt also helps to discuss what happened and how both parties felt before considering it something to gloss over.

From there, you can either say that you want to talk things through at [specific later date] after you've had more time to process or talk about what you need from her to fill out the rest of the apology. Something like 'I appreciate that you're reaching out and want to mend our relationship. To accept an apology, I really need to hear you apologize for a specific thing that hurt me and commit to avoiding that behavior going forward.'", "It seems like I'll be in the minority, but in my opinion, I say NTA, however, not innocent either.\n\nCommunication is a two way street. Her apology may have been typical in her culture, but your relationship is a personal situation, and thus, the two of you together should have communicated your issues to each other, including as to why you had an issue with a bowl of fruit as an apology.\n\nUnderstanding culture is important, but that also means she needs to understand yours. Personally, to me, apologies need to be communicated. Hitting me or cheating on me, or even something as simple as lying or acting aggressively isn't going to be solved for my by giving me a fruit bowl. I need you to communicate your feelings to me and tell me why you're sorry. So I agree that fruit is not an apology, regardless of culture or the intent behind it.\n\nHowever, you two REALLY need to talk and create the rules of YOUR PERSONAL relationship if you want these kinds of issues to stop.", "Honestly the way you've carefully worded this makes me wonder if you're not the one who should be apologizing.  YTA because anything that causes one person to leave and stay away overnight is bigger than only that person being wrong.  YTA for telling her that her culture isn't \"real world\".  YTA because even though you were told by someone else that knows the culture that it is valid, it doesn't meet what you and your family think should be an apology.  YTA for seeing someone and not even taking the time to learn about their culture.", "I think you should stick to your guns and be a lonely dumb ass the rest of your life.", "YTA. A quick Google search is all it took to confirm her friend isn\u2019t lying to you. Some cultures actually do apologize by giving plates of cut up fruit and it\u2019s actually a beautiful custom if you think about it. Instead of saying some words the person might not mean, they take the time and effort to pick out the fruit, prepare it and then present it to you. Expending this time and effort says you are important to me and worth it. Since you\u2019re leaving out what the argument is about, no one has any idea whether a more in depth apology or conversation is needed which also leads me to believe perhaps the person needing to apologize is you and you know it. Even if whatever happened to cause the argument is completely her fault, she tried to apologize in the way she knows and you threw it back in her face and dissed her culture as not the \u201c real world\u201d because it was different.", "YTA - What's wrong with you? Didn't you realize the fruit was an opening to talk about the issue? Typical Florida man strikes again.", "YTA it's a culture thing . Atleast she made an effort to apologise .what about you?", "I don\u2019t know about her culture but would like to know since is the same in LATAM.

They sat awkwardly on the floor, the proffered peace offering between them. Determined to find each other beneath yesterday\u2019s armor erected in defense, they stumbled through a conversation where each conceded a bit more than anticipated. A small smile was given and returned. A bit of overripe mango squished between her fingers, wiped playfully on his cheek. Moments later they are both sticky-sweet, making love amidst the efforts of her reconciliation.\n\nBut no, OP chose to be an ass.", "I'm sorry... why does SHE have to apologize?\n\nMr. Communication here stayed silent and went to work. THAT was his stellar way of apologizing?\n\nYTA", "YTA. If you bought her flowers to apologize, you would have expected her to, at the very least, soften up and use it as a gateway to talking.

I do that because I feel it's a way to show a person your sorry and to give them a nice treat as just a show of apology and tbf a giant plate of fruit seems like an awesome apology", "I think yta for automatically assuming that there's some weird conspiracy to make you believe that what she's doing isn't culturally relevant to her. If after 3 years you still know so little about her customs I think a great next step, if there will need to be one, would be to sit down and discuss her culture and their practices especially if you're planning a future that involves children. Relationships with people from the same culture still don't involve reading the others mind. If you want communication maybe try communicating. You didn't talk to her when you got home then pretty much told her to kick rocks when she told you she was trying to apologize by making you food then jumped on Reddit of all places to look for judgement..why are you okay communicating with a slew of internet strangers but not her?", "NAH. Both of you are still figuring each other out.", "NTA", "YTA. That was an olive branch in any culture.", "Info needed, what your argument was about? Was one of you completely in the wrong, or was this a both at fault situation? The way you glossed over it is a little weird. Obviously if she put your dog down without your permission and then tried to offer fruit, that would be a much different scenario than if you both had a spat about chores that got heated, and the fruit was a great step to resolving that which you rejected.\n\nGiven that you weren't completely in the right about a serious issue, YTA. When someone comes at you trying to reconcile, regardless of cultural specifics, you don't throw that back in their face.", "YTA. She literally told you she is apologizing to you. It also came with a crap load of fruit so if anything this is an above the top apology!  You want to still talk about it - that makes perfect sense but do so after accepting apology and acknowledging your role in the conflict.", "Soft YTA. I think you two need to grow up. You need to learn about her culture and what is important. She needs to do the same. \n\nI think its ridiculous that after learning about the fruit that you didn't accept the apology. Also claiming the friend is lying is such a weak deflection.. Google it, dude. \n\nYou can and should have a conversation with her about how you would like an apology communicated, but this whole \"sHe DiDnT sAy SoWwY hOw I wAnTeD\" is dumb.", "Soft YTA. Since you don't go into detail on what the argument was about, I'm going to assume you and your girlfriend both had things to apologize for. Your girlfriend took the first step of extending an olive branch to start that conversation. All you did was not speak to her that morning, and once again that night go to your room and continue to ignore her.\n\nYou're right that it's important to \"speak about situations,\" but the piece you're missing is that if one or both people are still letting anger drive them at that point, the conversation is just going to devolve into more fighting rather than actually hearing each other's feeling and making amends. You said you were still mad, and the way that you snapped at your girlfriend and immediately assumed the worst intentions shows that you weren't ready to have the conversation yet.\n\nHence the need for an olive branch. One or both people does something to show that they truly want to resolve the conflict. For your girlfriend, it's clear that giving the other person cut fruit is the olive branch that shows they're ready to start making amends. Other examples can be saying something kind to your partner, saying explicitly you don't want to fight anymore, using humor to lighten the mood (this is what usually comes naturally to me), or offering an immediate apology for something you've done.\n\nIt's important that the olive branch isn't where the conversation ends, which is what I think you were worried about. If she just gave you the fruit and expected everything to go back to normal, refusing to talk about it again, that would be understandable to call her out on. But I'm guessing if you had accepted the fruit and been grateful for it, you both would have been calmed down enough that you could talk through the situation more fully from there. Instead, you didn't accept her olive branch or offer one of your own, so it would have taken a lot of maturity for her to apologize. Think about this from the other perspective: your partner has been angrily ignoring you, but the second you go to talk to them, they demand an immediate apology before being willing to hear your side. Is that the kind of space that's going to make you likely to apologize?\n\nAt this point, I would take some time to calm your emotions and think about what kind of olive branch you want to extend to her. If you really feel regret about how you reacted, you could always bring her cut fruit and apologize for lashing out at her to start the conversation. Or if that doesn't feel right, even just telling her the regret you feel over making her cry and apologizing could be your olive branch. Take that first step and make yourself vulnerable with her, and hopefully from there you can both share your honest feelings, give true apologies, and move on with no regrets.", "YTA her coming to you with the fruit was her way of starting a conversation. It appears you\u2019re still upset and took it out on her instead of speaking about the situation.", "Soft YTA.  Why couldn\u2019t you take the fruit after she explained it and then ask to talk about your fight?  That way, both of your cultures way to apologize would be met.", "Yep, YTA. I honestly think that making something for someone after an argument is at least an attempt at an olive branch, even if it\u2019s not a full apology. That extends beyond cultures. The fruit could have been the start to a full discussion and apology.\n\nBut you didn\u2019t even get that far. Instead, you decided to still fight her on her method of peace and toss away that olive branch. You kept the argument going, and you likely caused some serious damage to your relationship if YOU don\u2019t follow up with a sincere apology.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add - you ALSO did some other questionable stuff here.\n1. YOU didn\u2019t apologize. Do you think the argument was solely your GF\u2019s fault? You have a part in the dispute as well.\n2. You questioned the Legitimacy of her apology through her culture.

Are you implying she lives in a world lesser than your own because of this?) and also criticizing an act of good will when it is hard to do that while upset with someone. She had good intentions and you shut her down in a mean way. That\u2019s not okay to do you girlfriend.", "As a Mexican, it is true that people cut fruits for an apology. Just because it's different in Florida it doesn't mean its the \"real world\".

It's fair to tell the person \"I understand you meant well by this gesture. However, I would like for you to apologize by recognizing what you did wrong. I understand that you did apologize but I would like for it to be different in the future.\" Works better than giving someone the silent treatment. \n\nYTA", "YTA \n\nYou can be right or you can be happy. \n\nStart cutting fruit.", "YTA.
