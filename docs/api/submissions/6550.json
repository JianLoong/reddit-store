Her and I have had a very healthy relationship however recently something happened that I feel I may be an asshole for. Ok so for context my girlfriend is Persian and Black, her parents and her are a rocky with her. They obviously love her but they aren't the most affectionate with each other. Her father would pull diamond with his bare hand just so his daughter could have the best jewelry. She is their only child so it makes sense that they'd be protective of her. I am a white man from Florida so there are somethings that her family does that doesn't make sense to me but I try to be open minded. \n\nNow for the story, so a couple days ago me and my girlfriend got into an argument. I won't say what about but it got pretty heated and ended in her storming out and staying with her parents. Well the next morning she came back and things were obviously tense and I ended up going to work without speaking to her. When I got back she was cutting fruits. Like a lot of them. I didn't think much of it and just went into my room. Eventually she knocked on the door and upon opening it she was standing there with a plate of fruit. I asked her what she was doing and she says \" it's for you\" I was still mad from our previous fight and just asked her \" are you not going to talk to be about yesterday? Or even apologize?\" to which she replied \" this is an apology?\" holding up the fruit again. I ended up telling her that's not a real apology and that in the real world we speak about situations not gift our way out of them. I heard her crying in the kitchen after and started to feel bad about what I said but at the time I truly thought that I was in the right. Well this morning her friend called asking how I could be so cruel to her. I was confused and at first thought my girlfriend skewed the story but then her friend explained that people in my girlfriends culture regularly apologize that way and that my girlfriend likely grew up receving cut fruit and foods after arguments with her family. Her and my girlfriends family have been chewing me out but I really just don't know. What if her friend is lying about the whole culture thing to make me feel bad? I've asked my family and they are on my side and also believe that the fruit thing wasnt a real apology. I still came on here to ask since i am a frequent reddit user. So AITA? Should I have just excepted her \"apology \" and moved on?", "created_utc": 1672925074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103yvg9/aita_for_not_taking_my_girlfriends_apology/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one needs to accept an apology, but if you\u2019re asking whether you\u2019re the asshole for refusing to accept what you consider not to be an apology but are willing to accept an apology only on your terms, yes, YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt is a thing in Western culture as well, it's called a peace offering.\n\nPlus the gesture was way more than you did. You gave her the silent treatment, avoided her and didn't make an effort to reconcile. She thought of you and came to you to reconcile and you just snapped at her.\n\nWhere was your apology huh?", "Wanting to talk about it is natural, but(rudely) brushing of a clear attempt at reconciliation makes you an ah. Even more so when you HEARD HER CRYING and did fuck all to console her. Yta", "I'm not seeing where she was wrong.  As such, YTA\n\nShe didn't outright apologize, but she was setting the stage for tensions to be eased so it wouldn't be heated conversation.  Clearly she's making an effort, and doing so effectively I might add.  What did you do to ease the tension?  Give her the silent treatment?  \n\nShe diffused the situation.  You poured gasoline all over it.  You tried to take her dignity.  \"Unless you come in here and grovel and use these specific words, I'm entitled to act like an ass with impunity.\"  \n\nShe made vastly more of an effort than you did.  You bulldozed right over her apology, and are now trying to claim \"Oh, that's not a *real* apology.\"  There's a time and a place for that line, but this ain't it.  YTA\n\nOh, you didn't apologize either.  Let's not forget that in all of this.", "Yeah, yta for not even trying to understand her culture.\n\nJust because it isn't an apology for typical FLORIDA MAN doesn't mean it's not how her family or culture does things.\n\nAmericans aren't the only ones.\n\nAlso, why does she have to approach you? You're in the relationship too.\n\nGrow up.", "YTA\n\nYou've been dating for 3 years? You clearly haven't made much effort to learn about her culture. \nJust because it was unknown to you, the way you reacted was uncalled for and disrespectful.\n\n>I am a white man from Florida so there are somethings that her family does that doesn't make sense to me but I try to be open minded.\n\nYou don't sound very open minded to me.\nApologize and do better or you may not have a girlfriend for much longer", "YTA\n\nAmericans are aware of what a peace offering or an olive branch is. I have a feeling you are in the wrong for your argument too but don\u2019t want to admit it.", "\u201cWhat if her friend is lying about the whole culture thing to make me feel bad?\u201d Wow you sound like a really fantastic boyfriend. Because that\u2019s a completely reasonable thing to think. /s\nYou clearly have access to the internet so a quick google isnt beyond your ability yet you\u2019re here and you didn\u2019t even see that particular line of thinking as unreasonable. I can only IMAGINE what parts of yourself as a partner you\u2019re choosing to leave out when there\u2019s so much questionable stuff you thought was fine to admit to. YTA", "YTA.  The fruit was the gateway to the conversation you wanted and you just slammed that door closed in your girlfriend's face.  While in different cultures the fruit can be taken different ways, it wasn't necessarily the actual point. The point is that your girlfriend was trying to apologize in her known method, you had the opportunity to take it and then transform the act into a conversation to resolve things which you failed miserably.  Also, if you don't believe the tradition for your gf culture, you could do some research on Google to see if it's true or not.", "YTA you could have accepted her gift and then talked about it. Why did it have to be one or the other.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nEven if you didn't know about her cultural custom of being fruit as a way of apology or its a lie, you should know an olive branch when you see one. \n\nThere was a way to accept what she was giving you and discussing what had happened in a calm, mature way. Her giving you the plate of fruit was an easy way to come back together and you acted like a bit of a jerk because you were still heated.", "Come on man, of course YTA.  Regardless of how she's doing it she's trying to apologize and make peace but you just shut her down because she's not putting the specific bow you want on the apology..  You also knowing that there's an obvious cultural difference but trying to act paranoid about it like there's some big Persian conspiracy that her family and girlfriend are cooking up to pull the wool over your eyes makes you an even bigger AH.\n\nIs this not better than her not apologizing?  Or wanting to hold on to the argument and keep the fight going?\n\nLighten up, meet her in the middle and apologize yourself.", "YTA - A lot of people might call you out for the cultural reasons but I am going to focus on you disregarding her efforts. She brought you a plate of fruit and all you needed to do was to say thank you and move on. If you wanted to talk about what happened that is fine, but you the way you went about it was uncalled for. \n\nAlso by your standards what constitutes a real apology? Does she have to verbally tell you?", "Taking time to make food for someone is a pretty common way of apologizing in my book, and I'm a white European. I understand it is probably more prominent in her culture, but it's not unheard of in general. \n\nYTA, I think you just wanted an explicit apology instead and disregarded all her effort.", "She clearly felt bad if she cried after just wanting to bring you something to make up for what she saw as her possibly overreacting when walking out. You could have very easily taken the plate of fruit, thanked her for it, then asked if you could talk about the fight you had previously if you were still upset over it. YTA", "YTA to the point where I think she'd better off without you in her life, because you are clearly not open to her culture because somehow it is not how things are done in your version of the 'real world'.You chose not to speak to her the next morning (*'I'* ended up going to work without speaking to her) and then complain because she did something nice for you instead of 'talking things out'.  And even when you are told that was her way of apologizing, you hold out.  Why?  Because she might be trying to trick you?  Is your ego that fragile?", "YTA. She said that was her apology, you could at least be gracious enough to receive it. Not an AH for explaining to her, how you would prefer an apology. Cultural understanding and open-mindedness go both ways.", "YTA oof you scare me dude", "YTA\n\nThe fruit wasn't an apology, it was an ice breaker. You sit down with each other, eat some fruit, stop freezing each other out, and start talking. Jesus, dude. Have some flexibility here. The conversation doesn't have to happen in the real world exactly the way you imagined it. It just needs to be allowed to happen. Did you think that cut fruit meant that the subject is closed, and there can be no more discussion on it? \"AHA! You ate the cantaloupe, so I never wanna hear another word about me banging your brother behind the dumpster of that Wendy's!\"\n\nWhat if it were a hug instead of fruit? Would that also have been \"not an apology\"? That's like THE go-to apology starter. Bringing you shit is pretty universally seen as a close second, believe it or not. Unless this fight was about something incredibly fucked up that she did to you, then you're seriously fucking up by acting this way. \n\nMaking up after a fight boils down to one question: Do you want to be together or not? When you answer that question for yourself, you take steps to ensure the outcome you want. Don't just pout, fuckin' do something. If you think you're owed an apology and owe none yourself, think again. Then again. If you still think it's 100% on her, and you still want to be together, then you're gonna have to get past the issue in your own mind, get over yourself, and tell tour ego to shut the fuck up. Then talk to her. \n\nIf (and this is always *far* more likely) there are things you can apologize for as well, then *do that*. Whether their actions justified it or not, saying or doing things that hurt your partner should make you feel bad, and you should apologize for them. From a purely pragmatic perspective, this tactic is very often reciprocated, and you both end up getting exactly what you want. It's like magic. You're supposed to be a team. Act like it.", "The thing is, anyone can say sorry. Showing you're sorry is more meaningful. It takes a lot more effort to prep a giant plate of fruit than it does to say the words. \n\nShe sounds amazing. Why are you thinking anyone would lie to you about cultural norms and why wouldn't you just appreciate the effort?\n\nYTA.", "I\u2019m failing to see how this argument come from a couple with \u2018a very healthy relationship\u2019.\n\nNothing more to add to what others has mentioned about olive branch/peace offerings. Verdict: YTA.", "YTA. Forget whether fruits are a traditional apology, it doesn't even affect the situation. She made an effort. You insulted her. Ergo, you're the problem here. You're the one that rejected what was supposed to be an apology and insulted the person giving it. This is an absolute no go in **your own** Christian cultural background. It's also the absolute opposite of what you said. You talked about communication and then buried any chance at it 20 feet underground. \n\nGet your head out of your ass and follow your own advice: first apologize, then communicate. Because I assure you everyone she's talking to is telling her not to try again and just wait to see wether you can unbury yourself from the hill you already died on.", "YTA. She made an effort. You continued to be hostile. When my husband and I get in a petty fight where neither of us was really \u201cwrong\u201d I will often do a small kind gesture after we both cool off. It opens the door to a discussion.", "YTA dude, you could have easily used her apology to start the dialogue for talking about what happened.", "YTA. \n\nGoggle it. Fruit offered as an apology is a thing. \n\nIf I were you, I would combine cultures by getting her a big fancy fruit arrangement, then verbally say you are sorry for not understanding her culture quickly enough. \n\nEdible Arrangements even has an \u201cI\u2019m Sorry\u201d fruit arrangement that can be delivered to your home. If you live in the US.", "YTA. She came in to reconcile and you shot it down unilaterally. And yes giving you cut fruit is a thing in some cultures. \n\nDo better.", "YTA. \n\nSo you didn't take any initiative to apologize or clear the air, but held your girlfriend to higher standard than what you would do yourself. \n\nYou left for work without speaking to her, you came home and went to the room without speaking to her, she came in with clearly a gesture of good will to OPEN the conversation, and you rejected her gesture and demanded an apology. \n\nYOU did absolutely nothing to fix the fight. And then have the nerve to tell her \"in the real world we speak about our situations\" but you never tried to speak about it. So how were you planning on fixing the situation? When were you planning to speak about it?", "YTA hope she dumps you!", "Okay so I\u2019m Persian and it is a thing. We use food, and particularly fruit, to show our love. It\u2019s very common for parents/grandparents to present large platters of cut up fruit to their children/grandchildren as a gesture of love and affection. Personally one of my favorite ways to say and receive an \u201cI love you\u201d is through food/cut up fruit. \n\nBUT even if it wasn\u2019t a thing. Even if it was just her thing, YTA. Like others have said this was a peace offering. When someone is showing you that they\u2019re willing to put their swords down and raise the white flag you don\u2019t then fight over terms right away, you also put your weapons down and prepare to start to mend things. \n\nYou need to learn to set your anger and pride aside if you want to be in a healthy relationship. That\u2019s what she did, she cut up a ton of fruit and came to you because she was putting her pride aside and preparing to repair things but you decided that you needed to tear her down just a little bit more to make yourself feel good.", "YTA\n\nYou have could said \u201cI\u2019m confused by the fruit. Could we talk this out instead?\u201d Or \u201cSure, we can nibble on fruit while we talk. Let\u2019s go sit down\u201d", "INFO: You have been together for 3 years and have never fought before?", "Yta,  she apologized in the way she knows how to. I stead of lashing out you could have gently explained why you were upset and how to discuss it moving forward", "YTA\n\nNot because you want to talk it out, but because she was clearly showing effort and you shut her down rudely. Could've just accepted the offer and asked if she wanted to talk about what happened.. Instead you insulted her \"in the real world we talk about what happened\". A-grade for making her feel like shit when she was trying to do something nice. \n\nNote: imo it's not even culture-related. My bf brings me tea sometimes after an argument just as a sign of good will and open up for conversation.", "My dad often gave me small gifts, like making a hot chocolate or cutting up some fruit (from the uk) after an argument if he was wrong. But it wasn\u2019t the full apology and we would try and communicate afterwards about what happened. \n\nThe real question OP is if you got angry straight away or if you gave your girlfriend a chance to speak first and then noticed she didn\u2019t intend to talk about the situation.", "YTA - All you had to do was say that you didn't know it was a form of apology, accept the apology, apologize yourself, and even ask about the tradition...that opens up for you to talk about what you did growing up. Communication is a great thing...instead you decided to say \"in the real world we speak about situations\" which is just petty and a little ironic since you chose not to speak about why she chose to do this instead since you didn't understand.", "YTA I don't understand how this is the first time this has ever come up in three years. If someone apologizes in a way you don't like you're allowed to discuss it with them, but in my opinion you were way too aggressive here.\n\nIt may depend on the content of the argument but I don't understand why she's the one who has to come grovelling to you? You're both in a relationship, you were both arguing, you should both want to resolve conflicts in a kind manner and seek to apologize if things get really heated. As a side note, don't use the silent treatment, it's childish", "YTA, gently. It was perfectly reasonable for you to want to discuss what the argument was about. She was making a peace offering and you should have accepted that. It would\u2019ve been perfectly fine to say. You both needed to work out with the problem was and resolve it, but you appreciate her conciliatory offering. You don\u2019t see what the argument was about or whether possibly, you might also owe her an apology.", "The fact that you\u2019re not saying  what the argument was about makes me suspicious too\u2026\n\nBut YTA. If you don\u2019t like this girl, cut her loose. I know loads of people who have the brains to recognise an olive branch and would love to be brought a plate of fruit. Did it ever cross your pea brain that she was trying to start a conversation with you and maybe that would have led to apologies and making up? Doodoo head. \n\nI don\u2019t think you told your family everything either or else they are as socially clueless as you to also not recognise a peace offering. Maybe that is where you learnt your childish tactic of silent treatment and bad communication from. \n\nThe fact that your first thought was your gf is being manipulative/lying about her culture shows what an unseasoned bag of rice you are. \n\nTry to grow up and act like the kind of man that a girl wants a future with. Part of being a man is navigating difficult conversations and dealing with things head on. Big boy pants and apologies, please.", "Florida man gets angry at girlfriend for apologizing to him because it came with a free snack. \nYTA.", "YTA, she was doing an apology based on Persian culture.  Get a clue.", "YTA. The fact you never learned about her culture enough, or when she gave you a plate of food and told you she was apologizing with it is very telling. You prefer to doubt her and her entire culture then actually asking her about this.", "YTA. \n\nWhat was said that made her want to leave?\n\nYou could have started a conversation yourself instead of sulking in your room. She tried to make peace and you decided to stay mad, that's not a good sign for the future.", "You can want a constructive apology but it's the way you say and do things.\nShe attempted to ease the tension, why couldn't you at least listen or ask for space if you didn't feel ready to talk? Relationships are not easy , specially with different backgrounds but they definitely need grace, patience and understanding. Looks like you'll be cutting ties or fruit in the upcoming days.", "YTA. I understand the desire to talk it out, but that is a legitimate way to apologize. I'm Asian, and it's pretty common in our culture. \n\n>I ended up telling her that's not a real apology and that in the real   \nworld we speak about situations not gift our way out of them.\n\nYou're TA for this. You implied that she has no awareness about the real world and that because of her relationship with her parents (I'm guessing gift-giving was the main form of affection), she doesn't know how to deal with adult life. Ultimately it's a cruel way to say it. \n\nYou could've acknowledged her apology and asked to talk it out as well. Intercultural relationships require intercultural ways of connecting. Plus, what the hell would your family know about apologies from a culture they're not part of?", "You could have viewed the fruit as a peace offering and a chance to get back to neutral and have the conversation you wanted to have. Your girlfriend showed vulnerability and you reacted with hostility, and as a result nobody got what they wanted. \n\nYTA because you assumed the worst and jumped to conclusions when you probably could have had the communication you wanted AND some fruit.", "YTA. I don't even think this is a cultural issue. She (quite literally) opened the door to conflict resolution. Just because she's holding a plate of fruit doesn't mean the conversation ends there and all is forgiven. An OlIvE bRaNcH? i WaNtEd An ApOloGy!

She doesn't know that you want a direct sit-down, just like you didn't know that cut fruit is a meant to be an apology. \n\n(Also I'm Asian so cut fruit/food is pretty well understood to be an apology to me. Is it perfect? No. But it says \"I'm not mad anymore\" and can open the door to a better apology)", "I'm gonna go with YTA because I feel like even if you are still expecting a verbal apology and acknowledgement of wrong doing, she was clearly trying to show contrition by putting effort in to doing something nice for you and bringing you a gift which could have been *opening the door towards an actual apology.* You don't *know* that she was just ignoring the problem.\n\nAnd what's with you not talking to her and ignoring her??? You're a grown ass adult too and you're giving your girlfriend the silent treatment for an entire day and the first thing you do when she even so much as approached you is *ask her what she's doing and criticize her???*\n\nExpecting other people to always use their words when you won't? That's called being a hypocrite.", "YTA. She reached to you with her form of apology, you could have thanked her for it and used that opportunity to talk over the problems in a civil manner. You undermined her efforts and disrespected her culture, YTA.", "Yta", "ESH. The fruit was her opening the door to a reconciliation conversation, your next words slammed that door shut\n\nBut yeah, that's not an apology. Cool it maybe in her culture, but why would she just expect you to know that. She could have handed the fruit over as well as start to talk about it", "NTA. Just because someone is from a different culture does not mean that culture doesn't work for you. \n\n\nMy dad is also Iranian. Every single fight between my mother and him ended with him buying her flowers. So guess what? Nothing ever got resolved. They had like the same three fights over and over again because he refused to talk about anything. \n\n\nThat's his culture and that's fine, but it eventually didn't work for my mom and it doesn't have to work for you. \n\n\nI'd suggest coming to a compromise. If she wants to start the conversation after a fight with some kind of offering, that's very sweet. But she still needs to be willing to have the conversation. Otherwise, I agree with you, it's not an apology.", "NTA. In my culture our parents sometimes apologise by moving on and treating you nice, like giving fruit, making food you like or just even talking nicely. I love my mom but it\u2019s usually made me feel more hurt than anything else. Returning to affection is fine but an apology takes communication. \n\nIt also helps to discuss what happened and how both parties felt before considering it something to gloss over. My mother apologised to me once on her own accord after an argument very recently and it honestly shook me I loved her even more for it. Apologies are powerful, I wouldn\u2019t call you cruel for asking for communication.", "YTA, yeah for Hispanics as well if you get in a fight food is used as a peace offering but while it\u2019s not a healthy way to cope, you also weren\u2019t open to being comprehensive and got defensive and reacted only.", "Yeah, hell of a lack of trust from OP who starts with 'the argument was heated and bad but you don't need to know what it was about or what we said... except that she left our shared living space upset and retreated to her parents. Trust me.'", "Seriously. My husband and I are both Americans, but whenever we fight, one of us brings the other a favorite drink or snack. At the very least, it makes sure that the person you're having a discussion with isn't hangry on top of being upset. \n\nYTA, OP.", "I\u2019m sorry but.. huh? \nMy parents do this as well as we\u2019re Russian and I hate it. I don\u2019t find it an apology. If I hurt someone\u2019s feelings and I bring them a gift, if THEY don\u2019t feel like that is an apology, it\u2019s not an apology. \nAn apology is meant to be received well by the person you are apologizing to. Did OP overreact? Yes. Was bringing fruit a valid apology.. no.", "Honestly I'd much rather receive a plate of cut fruit instead of magic \"I'm sorry\" words. You can say the words and not mean them. You can't put time and effort into food and not mean it.", "I dont think the \"apology\" is the issue. I think the lack of communication is. Its hard to say what the issue is since we dont know what the argument was about. BUTif it was serious, i understand that he would want to talk about it properly and not just accept the gift and pretend nothing ever happened", ">Americans aren't the only ones.\n\nBut they live in the \"real\" world /s", "What is with these comments? She is old enough to understand that when you wrong someone you apologize in a way that will make THEM happy. And certainly not whine to your friends afterwards. What if her culture's apology was a pat on the back? Would that be okay too? What you're saying doesn't make sense, she's not 5 years old and she should try to understand his feelings, since she's the one that needs to apologize. Y'all are saying these things so you'll not be considered racist I'm sure.", "Sliced fruit is not an apology.\n\n\u201cA sincere and effective apology is one that communicates genuine empathy, remorse, and regret as well as a promise to learn from your mistakes. In other words, you need to really believe you did something wrong and feel sorry for the hurt you caused.\u201d\n\nShe can apologize along with sliced fruit but to me sliced fruit alone (or any present for that matter) would not be sufficient.", "Listen, as a home grown one, we accept apologies in all forms... Especially food. This guy's just dumb", "Right? And they've been together a few years, and he was unaware? Wonder how much 'white man from Florida' pays attention to other details of his girlfriend's world...", "Just adding: Bringing people cut fruit after an argument is well-known way to start apologizing after a fight in multiple cultures. It mostly happens in Asia, south-east Asia and the Middle East, but happens all over.  This is how probably half of the humans currently alive start to apologize after a fight.", "It seems like she wanted to give sliced fruits in lieu of a discussion or apology though", "Usually even with peace offerings, People still talk it out because its not really healthy (In the longer run) to just sweep things under the rug without any talking about the incident at all. \n\nI wouldnt really stress about the actual words to apoligize, but if both sides want to be understood about why they felt that way , why they acted that way etc, they simply just need to talk about it.\n\nJust handing fruits and expecting everything to be fine without any conversation is exactly the same as men has been doing for long time with their jewelry -bribes. :\" your feelings are hurt? Here, take a necklace and shut up about it\"", "My thoughts exactly. Just say thank you but I would still really like to discuss what happened. Telling her it wasn't an apology was a jerk move", "This. And I\u2019m thinking that even if she did simply apologize, that wouldn\u2019t have been enough for OP either. From his own words, he seemed intent on keeping the argument going.", "Exactly this!", "YTA btw :)", "In Persian culture, fruit is a big thing to offer for a variety of situations. This isn\u2019t a unhealthy communication method.", "How is he NTA if you do consider his actions mean?", "Which I don\u2019t see leaving the situation to calm down and defuse as even a bad thing. As someone with anger issues sometimes I just need 10-15 minutes to breathe and take a step back from the situation. She left to stop the arguing when she came back she didn\u2019t start blowing up on him again she just came back he ignored her, she brought him a peace offering and he just didn\u2019t care.", "Not sure what you mean by this?", "It\u2019s a common saying in the US, \u201cwords are cheap\u201d and \u201cactions speak louder than words\u201d. \n\nPlenty of women receive flowers, chocolates, or jewelry from men who won\u2019t say they are sorry. It happens here too. \n\nThe only aspect that makes GFs apology odd is the fruit itself.  That would seem odd to an American. And especially from a Floridian because fruit is so plentiful and cheap there.", "\"But what if her culture's apology was a punch to the face?\" It's not, don't be ridiculous and make up scenarios that didn't happen.\nShe apologized to him in the way she was taught to when growing up and he dismissed her completely, because no apology is valid if FLORIDA MAN doesn't approve.\n\n\"She should try to understand his feelings\" He should try to communicate his feelings then, \"I appreciate you making the first step to a reconciliation, I would prefer if along with sliced fruit you gave a verbal apology since that's the way I like to give and receive apologies and it's more meaningful to me\" that's him trying to communicate his feelings. \n\nShe made the first step and he pushed her away.", "First, she was clearly working up to an apology or at least a discussion but he killed it dead. More importantly though, you're assuming that she wronged him 100% when it sounds more like they've both got something to be sorry for. Her bringing him a gift was much closer to an apology than his \"what the fuck's this?\" response.", "It could be a peace offering- OP is choosing not to say what the original argument was about so it's safe to assume that it wasn't a big deal. The girlfriend felt that she could bridge the tension, OP chose to wallow in hurt feelings.", "It's not an apology TO YOU. If he wanted her to do it differently he could talk to her instead of blowing her off.", "You cannot infer \u201cin lieu of\u201d. \n\nIt could easily be that once the gift was accepted, a conversation including a verbal acknowledgment and apology would follow.", "I hear what you're saying but I think we're overlooking the fact that it's very likely that a conversation would have happened after the peace offering had he been more focused on diffusing the situation rather than hearing the words \"I'm sorry\"..  He basically said he shut her down/called her out as soon as she walked in the door with the fruit, something along the lines of 'What's this for?  Are you not going to apologize?'.\n\nIt doesn't sound like he gave her the chance to really voice anything..", "Ah, but he never gave her a chance to start the conversation, just crapped all over her peace offering.", "Absolutely this!! The point of an apology is to admit you are wrong and have a discussion about how to move forward without stepping on each others toes. If she was just going to throw some fruit at the problem and be done with it than yeah thats not helpful, but she was probably giving admitting she was wrong with the fruit and trying to open up the space for conversation letting him know she was sorry before continuing. \nFruit doesnt solve the problem but it seems like its supposed to be the bridge to the conversation that will help moving forward.", "I don\u2019t think we can assume the argument wasn\u2019t a big deal.  Only OP can say whether he thinks it was a big deal.", "\u201cI ended up telling her that\u2019s not a real apology and that in the real world we speak about situations and don\u2019t gift our way out of them.\u201d\n\nSeems like he did explain his feelings to her and her response was to walk away and cry.  OP doesn\u2019t have to accept an apology if he thinks it\u2019s just brushing past the disagreement instead of addressing it.", "Or she could have interpreted the acceptance of the fruit as the completion of her \u201capology\u201d with no further discussion necessary.  We don\u2019t know.", "He chose not to share it, though, and there has to be some reason for it. Until OP spills, it's irrelevant to the judgement and we have to go with whether the fruit plate was enough of a peace offering to start an apology.", "There are many different ways to say you're sorry, us Americans are very direct with it though. A lot of cultures, especially in Asia and especially in the older generations, do see fruit cutting as an apology and its not fair to discount that.The only issue here is that neither of them have ever talked about what a sorry looks like to them. Ideally he should have said that's not what he sees as an apology and have a discussion instead of fully brushing off her attempt,  because it was genuine just different.Whether he accepted it or not is up to him but his way of addressing it was not cool.", "In other words, wherever this girl is from isn't \"the real world\". This could have been phrased a lot better.\n\nTo me, a plate of fruit would have been a nice gesture but I'd still have wanted to talk things through. It's not hard to express that without belittling your partner.\n\nFlorida Man fucked up and in the real world, actions have consequences.", "Seems like he dismissed her by telling her that her apology is not real and that in the rEaL world that's not how it's done. Which is wrong since she did apologize in her own way and he should acknowledge that before communicating how he'd prefer her to apologize.\n\nThe fact that she walked away crying makes me wonder if OP screamed at her, although that's speculation.", "If that would have happened, OP could open his mouth and communicate with her. Why is she the only one needing to apologize?", "Because something bad enough happened that GF left to stay with her parents, it\u2019s easy to assume that she was wanting some sort of acknowledgment from OP in return concerning his behavior. \n\nWhy are we all judging GF\u2019s apology and not expecting any sort of apology from OP?\n\nYou might not like fruit, but at least she was making an effort.", "He did", "Where? He didn\u2019t communicate or apologize at all to her. He just said \u201cyou\u2019re not going to apologize\u201d and \u201cthis is not an apology\u201d. He never once apologized or actually communicated anything with her.", "He said \u201cI don\u2019t think this is a sufficient apology\u201d and we honestly have no idea who owes who an apology, I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s fine to not accept sliced fruit as an apology"]}
