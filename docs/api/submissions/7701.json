We generally keep to ourselves. And most my family is has never said a thing or even questioned our relationship, they have been totally amazing and welcoming. So, generally speaking I am happy to invite anyone to stay with us when they visit the city we live in, we got plenty of space. Happy to do it and I pride myself on being a great host. \n\nThere's this one uncle though that I don't really talk to, we just aren't that close, but I know him ok. My Mom asked if he could stay with his family for a week while they visited. Not a problem I said. After the fact I looked him up on Facebook, I use it for work mainly, and rarely at that. I was unhappy to find a lot of typical right wing faire with the expected hateful rhetoric. My partner also saw and said they don't feel comfortable with that kind of person in the house, and I agreed. I called my mom and explained and said maybe they should find a motel and because I said I would let them stay I'd help pay. My mom was very understanding and said she'd take care of it. So, I thought it's all good. \n\nJump to the day they were supposed to come and it's ten at night we're about to go to bed, it's raining and cold. They are suddenly at our door. I asked them what they were doing here, did they talk to my Mom (his sister). He said yea, but he said that it would be ok, and that I'd get over it and do what's right for family. I said, no, that's not going to work for us, you were made aware that our home wasn't available and you know why. \n\nHe started to get upset and said oh why is that?! I said don't make me embarrass you in front of your family. He said he didn't care, so I pulled up Facebook while his whole family waited under our awning as it poured rain and started reading his worst most disgusting posts about gay people and trans people. His wife looked absolutely embarrassed and his teen daughter also looked very uncomfortable.\n\nEventually he just said to stop. I asked why? You Arne't proud of of this? He got really red and looked like he wanted to blow up. I told him that my Mom informed him he wasn't welcome with this kind of rhetoric open to the public, we don't feel safe with you around. He eventually said he didn't have anywhere to go, so they ended up sleeping in the car. We offered for his wife and kids to sleep in house but he wasn't welcome, he said no it was all or nothing. We apologized and said that's unfortunate. We saw them in the morning in the car as we left for work. \n\nA number of family members are livid we did this, but quite a few see our side.", "created_utc": 1674093348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10fp8xh/aita_for_causing_family_members_with_young_kids/", "score": 526, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he was even a remotely good person he'd have slept alone in the car", "NTA. What really is the cherry on top of the cake is his \"all or nothing\" attitude. Definitely deserved what he got.\n\nThat said, if you had been alone, you could have made a point that you are better than him, a better human being, by still welcoming an idiot like him into your house.

He also placed his wife and kids in that position.", "He showed up at 10pm to try to bully you in front of his wife and kids. If he actually had been planning on staying with you he would have called you directly to confirm and to also confirm the time they were arriving because it is rude AF for house guests to arrive late unless otherwise planned.  This was his way to show who was boss because he assumed you would say yes.  NTA", "NTA. You didn't \"do this.\"  Your bigoted uncle did. He made himself unwelcome by posting hate that made you feel unsafe with him your home. He was told he was unwelcome in advance, but showed up anyway. Then, when you said his wife and child could stay in your house, he went for high drama and rather than allowing them comfort, or getting a motel room for his family, and forced them to sleep in the care with him.  \n\nYour family members should be livid about your uncle's posts, not you maintaining the peace and security of your home in keeping the bigot out.", "NTA - he was told not to come to your house and he showed up anyhow. That\u2019s rude and inconsiderate. You also offered to foot the hotel bill, but obviously he thought pretty highly of himself that you would change your mind at the mere sight of his face.

Good for you for protecting yourself and your partner!", "NTA, but did your Mom tell him no, and he ignored, or was he telling the truth?", "His hatred did this. Your mother also made it clear.

And you did the kind thing by offering for the wife and kid to stay. The family that agree with him are the same people that say, \u201cI\u2019m not homophobic my hairdresser is gay!\u201d", "So, not only does this sound incredibly fake, but I\u2019m surprised you\u2019d let politics get in the way of actually showing kindness, which may indeed be a big step in allowing someone of an opposing mindset to more understanding of your view. We\u2019re the situations reversed, you\u2019d be absolutely furious that someone would do that over politics. \n\nYTA.", "Info: what made you feel unsafe?\nLooks like a missed opportunity to show him you were better than he thought and represent your community with dignity and grace. If he were willing to stay, differences aside, you could have educated him and changed his opinions, teachable moment. You don't want to be judged for your life choices but at the same time you are judge him for his opinions. Unless he explicitly made threats, you are being equally judgemental which makes YTA, because if you take away the differences of opinion/lifestyle, family should be there for family live. Clearly you knew that when you said yes to hosting, but left them high and dry based on your bias.", "NTA\n\nDid your mom ever say if she helped pay for the motel or what they responded to her?", "NTA and good for you", "Go you!", "NTA. You don't have to make yourselves uncomfortable or unsafe, and his wife could have chosen to stay despite his objections, but she didn't. Choices have consequences. The only thing you should have done differently is talk to him directly rather than talking to your mom, but he was clear he got the message, so that's not enough to alter the judgement.", "NTA - I am so impressed that I can hardly stand it--you are a total and complete mensch and your parents should be so proud that they raised a child with the courage and nerve to stand up to hateful bullies.  You handled this situation with courage and fortitude and good manners--bravo!!!!", "NTA. Balls of steel.", "NTA.
