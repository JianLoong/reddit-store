I\u2019ve made trips all over central and South America to visit various sites and places. \n\nMy mom is disabled and in a wheelchair. I take her on cruises a few times a year because I know she enjoys them. These don\u2019t feel very much like vacations to me because I am taking care of her and it can be a lot of work taking care of a disabled person in places not necessarily made to accommodate them. I have spent the past week and a half pushing her up and down steep hills (she\u2019s 275lbs, it\u2019s a challenge.) and around broken sidewalks  in ports, navigating crowds and elevators, her wheelchair broke and it took me a lot of stressful time fixing that, I\u2019ve helped her with her ADLs, etc. i do this at home too. We have to watch her diabetes, her fluid intake, etc. \n\nIt is exhausting. And I\u2019m a really active traveler, I like hikes and ATVs and exploring places she can\u2019t go but we\u2019ve done shopping, city tours, beach days for her. Months before we left I asked if she would mind if I took one of the stops in Mexico to see some ruins I haven\u2019t been to before. They\u2019re not particularly popular yet and a lot of the complex is still unexcavated. Nothing special but still a nice day and it would be a good break. She said she was fine with this. I triple checked and even checked the day before. \n\nWhen I came back from the excursion she was very quiet and withdrawn. My aunt messaged me saying that I was a selfish asshole because my mom was very hurt at being left behind today in a port she\u2019s never been to (it\u2019s costa Maya, it\u2019s a sucky port for the most part) I\u2019ve made her feel like a burden. She had been texting aunt while I was out.  I think this is attention seeking because I have never treated her like a burden, I do not usually vent about how stressed or overwhelmed I am and I gave her several chances to say she would prefer to do something together. \n\nShe does have a history of attention seeking behavior too (if I tell her I\u2019ll do something she wants done later she makes a show of doing it herself and then whimpers and wails about how much pain she\u2019s in to \u2018punish me\u2019 and make me feel guilty.

You should tell her that if you don't like the cruises and trips you take, maybe we shouldn't go on them anymore. I bet she changed her tune.", "NTA but also consider not taking her on vacations where you will struggle so much and/or consider hiring a home health aide to help you at home.", "NTA \n\nCan you plan vacations for yourself alone and she stays home?", "NTA - Considering how much work you have to do to take care of your mom, I have a hard time considering these trips with her much of a vacation for you and it's awesome that you are willing to do this for her.  It was completely reasonable for you to take a day for yourself to do something that she would not be able to enjoy or even be capable of doing.  I feel like the only thing that can be done with this pity-party attention seeking is to refuse to grant it any validity by simply ignoring it.  If she insists on doing something that you've told her you will handle in a reasonable time, just ignore the whimpering and whining.  And if she keeps this up, maybe it's time for a \"break\" in the cruising schedule for a little while.", "NTA\n\nYou asked your mom, she said she's fine but she actually was not fine. And instead of directly saying that, she routed to tell your aunt this who turned on you claiming that you're an AH....\n\nWell, there are two other people that need a reality check.", "I do kind of jump to the worst as part of my anxiety disorder. \n\nBut when she\u2019s fine one moment and I\u2019ve asked her to wait an hour for me to take out the trash because I just got home from a 12 hour shift and need to decompress and she insists it has to go *right then*\u2026 and her over exaggerated whimpers and whines. Like I get it, this sounds cold but there is a difference between her \u201cregular\u201d pain and when she\u2019s trying to guilt me and it\u2019s hard to describe.", "NTA. My dad was wheelchair bound for the end of his life. He had a power chair. While those are $$$$, I do know there are organizations & insurance premiums that might be able to furnish your mother with one. If she doesn't need an entire power chair, even a mobility scooter (which, I believe, can be purchased off amazon) can greatly improve her quality of life. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, most 'vacation' places outside of major cities are not wheelchair friendly. Not just hikes, but even older cities. This is one of those very disappointing, hard things your mother may have to deal with on her own, and has been venting to aunt to instead of coming to terms with. Although this may make things worse - could another person come along to be your mom's 'buddy' for the times you aren't around? Someone like aunt?", "NTA...  Being a caregiver is hard work at home, so I can only imagine what it's like while traveling. I think what you do is commendable, and a lot of adult children would not be \"bothered\" to take a mobility challenged parent on all these vacations. My 24 yr old son has been in a wheelchair for 3 years, and when we travel as a family, he opts to stay at the hotel or resort  sometimes while we venture out to site see, etc. He does that out of consideration for his family, and even if we insist he come, he recognizes his limitations. You're a sweetheart, and no, you're not wrong.", "NTA. You\u2019re too young, too active, and too into exploring the world to be pinned down like this all the time. Let your aunt deal with mom next time (or next few times) if she\u2019s so concerned for her.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nYou're a wonderful care-giver.  Care-giving is unrelenting ---stressful, exhausting!   Please take care of yourself with strong, healthy boundaries.  Don't let your mom guilt-trip about anything you want to do by and for yourself.\n\nI would practice strong, declarative responses to any of your mom's underhanded/manipulative behaviors/comments.  This forum is excellent for asking for help/examples in this regard.\n\nIn your situation, I would probably be moving rapidly towards a full-time care-giver for your mom.  I would not agree to taking her on any trips if she was not being considerate of your needs for private time.  Just not worth it.  To expect her to act differently is unlikely.  Please protect yourself.", "NTA  - You are both adults and she supported your excursion only for you to find her sulking. She had the option to remain on the cruise ship or explore the port. Have a heart to heart talk with her; you are on the earth at the same time and she needs to create her life options. You are not responsible for her happiness and whining to others after she supported your personal time is not acceptable. Consider therapy to learn skills to convey your thoughts; mom can be invited to sessions so you gain a deeper understanding of your relationship and boundarys..", "NTA, but I do want to give your mom the benefit of the doubt here.  You literally asked her if she minded, and she said it was fine.  If she had a problem with that, she could have said something.  I think there's a chance that she was just venting to your aunt about her feelings and then your aunt took it upon herself to scold you, because even if you didn't do anything to make her feel like a burden that doesn't mean she won't feel that way herself.  \n\nI do think you should talk to your mom about it and ask if she's actually upset about you/asked your aunt to say something.  More direct communication could do a lot to benefit your relationship, and it does sound like you might have a tendency to assume the worst of her intentions.  I also can't say for sure, but some of her behavior that you've labeled as attention-seeking sounds like it could potentially just be her wanting things done sooner and not wanting to push you to do it, and the wailing could just be because she's, ya know, in pain, not necessarily to \"punish\" you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
