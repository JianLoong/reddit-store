It was completely reasonable for you to take a day for yourself to do something that she would not be able to enjoy or even be capable of doing.  I feel like the only thing that can be done with this pity-party attention seeking is to refuse to grant it any validity by simply ignoring it.  If she insists on doing something that you've told her you will handle in a reasonable time, just ignore the whimpering and whining.  And if she keeps this up, maybe it's time for a \"break\" in the cruising schedule for a little while.", "NTA\n\nYou asked your mom, she said she's fine but she actually was not fine.

My dad was wheelchair bound for the end of his life. He had a power chair. While those are $$$$, I do know there are organizations & insurance premiums that might be able to furnish your mother with one. If she doesn't need an entire power chair, even a mobility scooter (which, I believe, can be purchased off amazon) can greatly improve her quality of life. \n\nThe fact of the matter is, most 'vacation' places outside of major cities are not wheelchair friendly. Not just hikes, but even older cities. This is one of those very disappointing, hard things your mother may have to deal with on her own, and has been venting to aunt to instead of coming to terms with. Although this may make things worse - could another person come along to be your mom's 'buddy' for the times you aren't around? Someone like aunt?", "NTA...  Being a caregiver is hard work at home, so I can only imagine what it's like while traveling. I think what you do is commendable, and a lot of adult children would not be \"bothered\" to take a mobility challenged parent on all these vacations. My 24 yr old son has been in a wheelchair for 3 years, and when we travel as a family, he opts to stay at the hotel or resort  sometimes while we venture out to site see, etc. He does that out of consideration for his family, and even if we insist he come, he recognizes his limitations. You're a sweetheart, and no, you're not wrong.", "NTA. You\u2019re too young, too active, and too into exploring the world to be pinned down like this all the time. Let your aunt deal with mom next time (or next few times) if she\u2019s so concerned for her.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nYou're a wonderful care-giver.  Care-giving is unrelenting ---stressful, exhausting!   Please take care of yourself with strong, healthy boundaries.  Don't let your mom guilt-trip about anything you want to do by and for yourself.\n\nI would practice strong, declarative responses to any of your mom's underhanded/manipulative behaviors/comments.  This forum is excellent for asking for help/examples in this regard.\n\nIn your situation, I would probably be moving rapidly towards a full-time care-giver for your mom.  I would not agree to taking her on any trips if she was not being considerate of your needs for private time.  Just not worth it.  To expect her to act differently is unlikely.  Please protect yourself.", "NTA  - You are both adults and she supported your excursion only for you to find her sulking. She had the option to remain on the cruise ship or explore the port. Have a heart to heart talk with her; you are on the earth at the same time and she needs to create her life options. You are not responsible for her happiness and whining to others after she supported your personal time is not acceptable. Consider therapy to learn skills to convey your thoughts; mom can be invited to sessions so you gain a deeper understanding of your relationship and boundarys..", "NTA, but I do want to give your mom the benefit of the doubt here.  You literally asked her if she minded, and she said it was fine.  If she had a problem with that, she could have said something.  I think there's a chance that she was just venting to your aunt about her feelings and then your aunt took it upon herself to scold you, because even if you didn't do anything to make her feel like a burden that doesn't mean she won't feel that way herself.  \n\nI do think you should talk to your mom about it and ask if she's actually upset about you/asked your aunt to say something.  More direct communication could do a lot to benefit your relationship, and it does sound like you might have a tendency to assume the worst of her intentions.  I also can't say for sure, but some of her behavior that you've labeled as attention-seeking sounds like it could potentially just be her wanting things done sooner and not wanting to push you to do it, and the wailing could just be because she's, ya know, in pain, not necessarily to \"punish\" you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell her that you'll plan a separate trip for the two of you together, but that you want to do some solo exploration on this one. \n\nIt will only hurt her if she refuses to act like a mature adult. I'd never expect a family member to take me on every vacation they went on.", "A saying i am fond of is \"Do not light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\"  Her doing the whining and all that is manipulation, and you should not fall bad about being annoyed by that.  Take your dream trip alone, ignore the whine.  You have a life to live too, and it should not be spent as a slave to -her- desires.", "I think that she'd insist on going wherever you planned to go. It will offend her if you leave without her; she'll guilt you and your aunt will get mad again. But the alternative is her preventing you from relaxing and enjoying your dream vacation. And it doesn't sound like your aunt bothers to take her on vacations.", "I think it\u2019s just her plea not to be left behind without straight out like.. saying it if that makes sense. I\u2019ve been going by myself more often. I did Peru last year, Brazil this year and am doing a 2 day trip to NYC in Jan but between those we did\u2026 a trip to Alaska for her, a 2 week cruise in Feb, this cruise and we\u2019re doing a week in an all inclusive in March. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m leaving her behind to rot.", "She doesn\u2019t \ud83d\ude05 to be fair my aunt hasn\u2019t gone on many vacations herself. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth the guilt I\u2019ll feel."]}
