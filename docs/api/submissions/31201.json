There's a huge difference between constant shouting, and where that shouting is putting down the child and saying awful things to them, and an occasional raised voice when warranted by a child's own behavior.", "NTA. \n\nAt 10, she did just plain ignore what you said and did not give a fuck. \nShouting, often not good for kids, is a human reaction to this scenario and will underline the seriousness of this situation for her. \n\nA slip, at most. Nothing to worry about.", "NTA\n\nWhat your daughter did is dangerous and clearly she isn't learning anything just by having it explained to her.  \n\nRaising your voice to your kids when they are doing something that could hurt someone else is not bad parenting.", "NTA.\n\nWe can't always help shouting in the moment, and you were worried about your son. When you spoke to her afterwards, you explained that and apologised.\n\nI think most parents wish they would never have to shout at their kids but sometimes it does happen. If she keeps doing it without listening, then something needs to be said, and this is how it happened.\n\nYes it's unfair, and you're going to feel guilty about it, but I think as you did the explaining you're all good- and hopefully a lesson was learned.", "Sometimes when you walk into shin height table you shout fuck regardless of if children are around or it is a professional situation. \n\nSometimes when you are worried about your son after your daughter has done something you have told her multiple times to stop, you shout at said daughter. \n\nAre either of those situations ideal? Do they happen anyway? Absolutely.\n\nYou didn't say anything horrible to your daughter and you apologised. Sometimes Mum and Dad have big emotions too. It's how they handle them that's important. \n\nAlso as a good parent, you have to the be cause of at least some of your children's distress. Not saying that should be your goal but someone's got to prevent them from doing fun looking dangerous or rude things haven't they.", "NTA literally normal parenting. \n\nis shouting at your children when they're clearly in the wrong considered wrong nowadays ?", "NAH\n\nIn the heat of the moment it can be natural reflex to shout, especially over something you have asked/told several times.\n\nYou apologised to your daughter and your daughter now knows the consequences of what happens when she flings doors open.

You can\u2019t even shout at your kids after a pre-warned completely avoidable stupid act causing serious harm? Obvious NTA", "Well,  asking, gentle requests didn't help.  This did.

But not because I actually think you are an asshole. Shouting at her while she was in distress over hurting her brother was a mistake in my opinion. My parents where often angry with me on top of me already being hurt or distressed / having hurt somebody else and it seriously fucks you up. This panic you have when you make a mistake and you try to hide it instead of calmly fixing it - it think this comes from that. This extra layer of \u201epeople/parents are going to be mad at me and I am going to get screamed at\u201c is damaging in a latent way. \n\nYou can just ask her what happened leading up to her hitting your brother with the door. Then remind her of your lesson and she would have practically figured it out herself that she made a mistake.", "NTA.  I don't believe parents should yell at children all the time, but she has persisted in unsafe behavior, which has now resulted in an injury to her brother. I think your behavior was appropriate, and I don't think you should have apologized.", "NTA \n\nI grew up when spanking was a thing.  A shout is maybe not the best response, but it's much better than physical violence.  \n\nThe way you handled it afterwards was mature and respectful.   So, IMHO,  you're doing the parent thing well.", "You are human and your daughter will be fine.

But you recognized it was wrong and apologized, just make sure it doesn't happen in the future to the best of your ability.", "NTA.\nYou warned her about the potential results of her actions multiple times but she didn't listen, which is normal for most children. It's understandable that you were frustrated with that fact and it all just came out in the heat of the moment. What matters is that you apologised afterwards and helped her understand.", "  \nNTA. While shouting at your daughter is not an ideal parenting method, it is understandable that you reacted in the heat of the moment.

You would have been T A if you hadn't done that.", "Don't apologise for yelling when they do something bad", "I very rarely shout but it seems to be an involuntary reaction when someone is putting me, my child, my dog etc. in danger. I remember shouting at my son when he was about 5 and opened the car door while it was in motion. I shouted at a grandkid for kicking my dog, I shouted at my husband when he was about to rear end someone. \n\nPoint is, your child was hurt so your visceral response was to shout at the person doing the harm. It's not a bad thing in those of us who rarely shout as it gets attention and conveys the seriousness of a situation.\n\nYou apologized and hopefully the shouting and injury will be what got your daughter's attention. You were right to apologize and explain. No harm done, except to your son, of course.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRaising your voice over something minor like talking with their mouth full wouldn't be on.

What you did is the perfect example of a mothers saying \u201cthey don\u2019t do anything until I ask them three times and yell at them twice.\u201d \n\nYou handled it very well. Even went in to explain why you shouted and apologized. \n\nGirl have some wine and let it go.", "NTA\n\nCrime= punishment.\n\nClearly what you have or havnt been doing up untill that point has achieved nothing though.", "Side note, minimize the closed doors, next time the injury could be worse.

Explain that you have repeatedly told her not to do so and she always says she won\u2019t do it again but now she did and it actually hurt her brother.  From now on it is 100% forbidden. And if it does happen again then her punishment is xx. And pick something she hates. Bedtime goes from 9:30 to 7:30.  Or she cannot watch television for 1 week.   Or she has to clean every bathroom toilet in the house for 2 weeks.   And if it happens one or two more time she gets the punishment.   More than that the punishment needs to be bigger.", "NTA:  In all fairness...there is a difference between being always or often shouted at vs the rare/once in a blue moon yell.  Perhaps it's this rare occasion that will finally impress upon your daughter the problem of running through the house.", "NTA, at all. You did nothing wrong. Your kids won't die from being disciplined. \n\nYou didn't just shout at her out of the blue, you have repeatedly warned her not to do so. Your son got hurt because she didn't listen, so you yelled at her. Hopefully she would stop now that she's seen the repercussions of her actions.", "I agree with the others they said NTA and you actually went to help her brother I know many a parent who would scream at your daughter and ignore her brother but you handled it well. I hope your daughter improves with this situation. Once again NTA", "NTA. As a kid, I was shouted at more times than I care to count. No one ever apologized to me and to this day I struggle with anxiety when someone yells. You spoke to your child once you had calmed down, explained why you got mad, and apologized for raising your voice. You showed your daughter what it means to humble yourself and hopefully she learned a lesson about running into doors. You\u2019re a good mom.", "This. Shouting at a child is never great, but we are humans. Sometimes you forget to think about other people's feelings for 10 seconds, when its a stressy situation. But if it doesn't happen often and you take the responsibility of your actions and apologise, you are not an AH.", "Not to mention that shouting can happen when adrenaline runs high, and that emotions are high. It wasn\u2019t OP reaction to her daughter\u2019s first time doing this, and she apologised for her reaction and talked calmly with her daughter after this. To me this is good parenting behaviour", "Plus, a child can understand shooting out of fear, I used to work at a school, and once we were walking, and I shouted at a child and pulled him back kinda violently (didn't hurt him but ofc he was shocked) but he understood pretty fast when a car came full speed on the road and he wasn't paying attention, apologize and explain why you reacted like that and it's okay", "Well spoken. This exactly.\n\nOP, I think you handled it well. \n\nNTA.", "There's also a difference between fear-shouting and aggression-shouting. When we react in a situation where we're scared sometimes we do so in a way we wouldn't normally. If your kids go to run out into the street you get scared and might grab at whatever of theirs to reel them in even if it's their hair or something because you don't want them to get harmed. Normally you would never pull their hair or shout \"what are you doing\" at them, but in that moment? You're just scared!", "you are right.", " \nI think it\u2019s more you should think about the long term effects of a punishment rather than just the immediate effects. \nShouting and screaming is not the way to get a point across to another human being. If you want to teach a child about how to effectively communicate intense and difficult emotions, the best way to do that is through example.\n\nETA: and if you do shout it\u2019s important to apologize to again show through example that is not an acceptable way to communicate", "Or not.

But I totally forgot in the moment. And I was a timid child trying to do everything right and still just forgot. My parents were also not nice about it. It does not all the time need to be an impairment.", "No I will not chill when a despicable parent is or has abused their child"]}
