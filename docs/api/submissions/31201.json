I am BIG on not yelling at kids, I was verbally abused as a child and I know how damaging shouting can be .. when it's misplaced.  That's the key word.  If you screamed at your child for a complete accident or something she didn't know was wrong, you'd be the asshole.  But yelling is not harmful in the right situations.  Your daughter is 10, she's old enough to comprehend \"that's dangerous, don't do it.\"  Even my class of two year olds are often able to do that.  One child was climbing on the table.  I said in a level voice \"no no Archie, that's not safe, you could fall.\"  He looked at the floor, got off the table and said \"okay.\" And stopped doing it.  Another child kept giggling and doing it anyway.  I raised my voice, not screaming or really yelling, but louder and stern.  \"Layla, GET DOWN.\" She did and I talked to her and told her how falling off the table could hurt her.  She stopped the behavior, but was back to playing and feeling happy again in a few minutes.  I do not feel that was damagingat all, but letting her risk her safety would be.  If I had not taught that lesson, she would be learning that it's okay to do dangerous things.  Some kids just plain need a sterner approach to actually cement learning something, especially a kid age 10 whp fully has the capacity to grasp that concept and has been told it multiple times.

In my childless opinion, yes. But I know a lot of people who know more about raising humans say it\u2019s not great, because their brains can\u2019t conceptualize why/they\u2019re already scared and you\u2019re no longer acting \u201csafe\u201d toward them, so it can be traumatizing. But that\u2019s where the apology comes in!! It\u2019s overwhelmingly better to be a real person who makes mistakes and takes actual ownership of them than to be a perfect parent.

She tested her boundaries today, as all kids do, and she saw how boundaries are there to protect. I\u2019m sure the next time she makes a mistake she\u2019s also going to think about the time you took a beat to collect yourself and then had a calm conversation with her to apologize and explain, so she can in turn collect herself, apologize, and explain. \n\nMy only advice is that if you see her trying to do that, encourage it!", "NTA", "NTA at all. What\u2019s important is you explained after. It\u2019s actually very healthy for kids to see you yell/lose control once in a while, and apologize/explain afterwards.

They see that modeled in this situation. \nIf you are \u201cperfect\u201d all the time then they may grow up thinking that getting frustrated sometimes means that something is wrong with them. \nMy toddler will already tell me when I\u2019m feeling frustrated because we\u2019ve gone over it with her. She also knows that being frustrated or mad does not affect the fact that we always love her.", "nta at all.
