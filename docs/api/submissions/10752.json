You're treating her like an adult who lost $2500 that she didn't earn.", "NTA - she doesn't sound responsible for handling money, so I'd take over too if I were you. If you're being required to pay for things, you get a huge say in where that money goes.", "NTA\n\nObviously she is not responsible enough to handle money. On top of it she spent the money that was meant for savings, not bills. ( per OP comment to another redditor ) \n\nIf she can't be trusted with the responsibility then someone else needs to be.\n\nWhat is she going to do when you and your sister meet a person and fall in love, and want to start a family of your own? You both are going to want to move out to live with partners. So she needs to be getting a job, and pitching in so she can afford the bills on her own, and you and your sister need to work with her to teach her how to be responsible with money so she can eventually live on her own.", "NTA.

Act like a child with money, get treated like a child.", "NAH. Words matter and sometimes we use the wrong words and that's what causes the issue. You aren't treating her like child, you are just managing the finances cause she has difficulty with them.", "INFO: you said after two months $2500 was gone. Were you paying for expenses as well or was mortgage, electricity, food, gas, etc supposed to be coming from this? Because if so $2500 is nothing for two months living expenses", "NTA.

Pay bills directly to whoever it is due to yourself, without going through your mother.\n\nTrust me,  Your mom knows where the money went, she just won\u2019t tell you. Your mom can/should work too. There is no reason for her to be a stay at home for 10 years when you and your sisters are grown. Don\u2019t give your mother any money either. Tbh, I think she is using you/your sister for your money so she won\u2019t have to work, since your dad isn\u2019t in the picture to do so. Only when she has to work will she actually do so. Your mom shouldn\u2019t be making household decisions if she can\u2019t provide the $$ to maintain it, regardless of being the eldest or the parent. \n\nI really hope you can continue your education at least part time with local college or something, even if it\u2019s like 1-2 classes a semester.", "NAH yet. Have you sat down with your mother to try and teach her how to run a bank account? Did your father keep her out entirely of finances? If so kind of understandable she wouldnt' quite know what to do.

You need separate accounts and maybe discuss supporting her to get a part time job for fun money? Do not give her more as she'll just become a further target for whatever drained the account. Providing all the living costs for her as she grieves is wonderful of you. I think that should be as far as it goes. A bit of fun money can be earned by cooking some meals for people, babysitting, cleaning, ironing etc. Or she can look at her previous career? You and your sister need to set up separate accounts for yourselves then splits living costs only.

I make a decent amount of money at my current job, but I'm not rich by any means. I still live with my parents for the moment, but Iv'e been planning on moving out for more or less the same reason. My mother is constantly \"borrowing\" my money by taking it directly out of my account (which I made when I was a minor, and that she still has access to). She always tells me that she'll pay me back, but she doesn't currently have a job, and still relies on my dad's income for groceries, bills, and the like. A lot of my money goes to these and groceries. Most of said groceries are junk food for my youngest brother, and some normal food sprinkled in. It's getting to the point were I can barely afford groceries for myself, and I'm worried that I won't have enough money to move out this year like I want to.

Without going into detail, they suggested a plan that normally I would never have agreed to but decided to give it a try. I now have myself on a strict budget, and I keep a spreadsheet that they can look at any time to see how I\u2019m doing. They rarely check it, and just ask me if I\u2019m keeping it up.

She is only 53 and she can work in a grocery store, work at Walmart, work at a fast food restaurant, work as an aid at a school, or several other starter jobs.  There is no shame in working and she should take pride in earning her own money.  You should take over paying specific bills but no $$$ directly in her hands.   Give her a dollar amount that she is expected to bring into the home toward bills and make her responsible for her own necessity items.", "Honestly, probably just shopping to deal with grief. It's easy to overspent that way. Just $25 here, $50 there & so on & so on. Extra meal out with a friend, there's $75 gone. When asked about where $2.5k went you have no idea because you certainly didn't spend anything like that, you just spent a couple of bucks. \n\nNot that she couldn't be snorting coke off a hooker's ass while playing the ponies.

They think they are helping someone but are being taken advantage of.  Just another option", "It's such a black hole to fall into. Unfortunately all of us \"kids\" have divided up her bills and give her an allowance.  Grief therapy is awesome and it should be talked about more", "NTA \n\nPossibly retail therapy? Since she can\u2019t manage finances someone responsible has to", "NTA but if I were you, I'd try to check her phone/emails to make sure she isn't \"in a relationship\" with some \"rich and handsome man who is in the military and currently deployed/working on an oil rig\".\n\nMiddle age single women are a prime target for romance scammers. $2500 is too much money to be just bad management, being victim of a scam is highly probable.\n\nIt's a good thing that she doesn't earn money on her own, take full control of the finances, only give her what she needs for groceries (and ask for a receipt, if she is in a romance scam, she may buy gift cards for the scammer).", "If she *genuinely* does not know where that money went, it's beyond time to get your mother to a doctor and talk about the possibility of dementia. That is a LOT of money to just lose track of.\n\nIf you think she does know and is lying (for example, to cover up that she's been scammed, which I think is the most likely problem, but it could be gambling or drugs or any number of other things), then I'd still treat her as if she might have dementia, because based on what she's told you, it's kind of the only reasonable assumption, and if she wants you to make a different assumption, she's going to have to come clean. \n\nIf she DID get scammed, that may be an early warning of dementia. Critical thinking skills are among the first things to go, often before you see other signs. I've been through this with my mom, who was a smart, shrewd, not-easily-duped woman right up until the point where she started giving money to anyone who asked for it. A year or so later, we noticed more symptoms, but that's how it started.\n\nEditing to add that your mother is young for that, but definitely not TOO young, unfortunately. Her age is an additional reason to get her to a doctor soon, though, because there's a good chance her memory loss may be due to something organic and *fixable*, and the sooner you figure that out, the better.", "Pay close attention, this type of situation can be the first signs of dementia or Alzheimer's!!!", "*(Looking uneasily at the empty containers from my third GrubHub order this week)*"]}
