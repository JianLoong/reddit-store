You are not treating her like a child. You are ensuring that the money you and your sister earn is spent responsibly. Your mom clearly isn't able to do that. Did your father handle finances before he passed? It may be that your mom had no idea how to manage money. Anyway, you are helping your mom stay in her home and are not in any way an asshole.", "NTA - but I feel like there\u2019s some missing context from \u201c$2500 is unaccounted for\u201d to \u201ctreating my mom like a child\u201d.", "That's not treating your mother like a child, that's treating her like an irresponsible handler of household finances (which is pretty clearly the case).\n\nTreat her with respect and dignity, but don't trust her with money.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou gave her a shot at handling the house finances, but she has shown that she can't handle it (there is $2500 unaccounted for).  It makes sense for someone who can to take over.", "NTA, you're also not treating her like a child. You're treating her like an adult who lost $2500 that she didn't earn.", "NTA - she doesn't sound responsible for handling money, so I'd take over too if I were you. If you're being required to pay for things, you get a huge say in where that money goes.", "NTA\n\nObviously she is not responsible enough to handle money. On top of it she spent the money that was meant for savings, not bills. ( per OP comment to another redditor ) \n\nIf she can't be trusted with the responsibility then someone else needs to be.\n\nWhat is she going to do when you and your sister meet a person and fall in love, and want to start a family of your own? You both are going to want to move out to live with partners. So she needs to be getting a job, and pitching in so she can afford the bills on her own, and you and your sister need to work with her to teach her how to be responsible with money so she can eventually live on her own.", "NTA. If she can\u2019t tell you where money is going then of course you need to deal with it that\u2019s your money she\u2019s losing! You also need a plan going forward, you and your sister won\u2019t live at home forever then what is she going to do?", "NTA - she's shown to be untrustworthy with money, you're protecting your money and making sure it's going where it should.  Act like a child with money, get treated like a child.", "NAH. Words matter and sometimes we use the wrong words and that's what causes the issue. You aren't treating her like child, you are just managing the finances cause she has difficulty with them.", "INFO: you said after two months $2500 was gone. Were you paying for expenses as well or was mortgage, electricity, food, gas, etc supposed to be coming from this? Because if so $2500 is nothing for two months living expenses", "NTA. You aren't treating her like a child. You are making sure the bills get paid so you all have a roof over your heads.", "NTA\n\n(Sound like my mother)\n\nIn my experience, Merging bank accounts with family always ends badly, in my opinion. Don\u2019t give your mother  control of the money or access. Pay bills directly to whoever it is due to yourself, without going through your mother.\n\nTrust me,  Your mom knows where the money went, she just won\u2019t tell you. Your mom can/should work too. There is no reason for her to be a stay at home for 10 years when you and your sisters are grown. Don\u2019t give your mother any money either. Tbh, I think she is using you/your sister for your money so she won\u2019t have to work, since your dad isn\u2019t in the picture to do so. Only when she has to work will she actually do so. Your mom shouldn\u2019t be making household decisions if she can\u2019t provide the $$ to maintain it, regardless of being the eldest or the parent. \n\nI really hope you can continue your education at least part time with local college or something, even if it\u2019s like 1-2 classes a semester.", "NAH yet. Have you sat down with your mother to try and teach her how to run a bank account? Did your father keep her out entirely of finances? If so kind of understandable she wouldnt' quite know what to do. Work on helping her not treating her like a child (not exactly sure how you do but really doesn't sound good)", "NTA\n\nPerhaps your mother like gambling. I mean, if suddenly 2500 dollars disappears without a trace. Gambling or drugs.", "Put the bills in your name(s) & take direct responsibility for paying them.
