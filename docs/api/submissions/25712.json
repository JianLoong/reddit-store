Its also worth noting that the walls are really thin, so having private conversations is close to impossible.\n\nI dont like Chad. Actually, i hate Chad with my entire beeing. I hope he steps on lego and that his pillow is always warm. I\u00b4ll explain why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy friend Bea is the sweetest person. She is kind, caring, beautiful, funny and smart.  However, Bea has a pretty big flaw as she is a chronic people pleaser. This has brought her into quite a few toxic situationships, and its horrible seeing her allowing people to use her this way.\n\nChad came into the picture in january 2023. He attends the same classes as us, and they were introduced through a mutual friend. Chad only invited Bea over when he wanted intimacy, and if they saw each other in public he ignored her. Chad is a mamas boy, and has never had to work for anything in his life. When Bea would come over she ended up cooking for him, doing his laundry and cleaning, all while he ignored her and gamed. He was controlling and isolated Bea from her friends, and they always argued. This went on for months.\n\nBea and Chad became a couple in june, but because ive been in my hometown for a while i\u00b4ve not really met him. Bea tells me that \"they almost never fight anymore\" but im sceptical.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBack to present-time. Bea asked me and Sophie if we were ok with Chad being around most of the time, and i told her i am not. She then began to explain that he is a good person and so on.. I didnt get to say more on the topic before they moved on to the next.\n\nLater that night Bea comes by my room to show the text she sendt our landlord that contained some questions we had. One of the questions she asked was if our landlord wanted extra payment because Chad would be staying here a lot. ....What?\n\nI kept quiet, but as the days went by i became more uncomfortable. I wanted to talk about it alone, but Chad was always around. Saturday i sendt Bea a text where i told her i wasnt comfortable with Chad living here. She replied after several hours that she didnt see the problem. He usally stays in her room and i stay in mine. I told her i have bad social anxiety and im generally scared of men (thanks dad). I also said i agreed to move in with her and Sophie, not her, Sophie and Chad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe got annoyed, but asked if we could talk about it.

While I'd certainly say Bea can have Chad visit, he should not be there regularly using the space that you are paying for.

You can advise, but only up to a certain point.  Then you should butt out.", "NTA\n\nYou should definitely set a limit on how long a guest can stay", "NTA. You said it correctly: you agreed to move in with her and Sophie, not Chat.\n\nWhat is Sophies opinion?\n\nPlease let us know how the talk went.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\n\n**YOU** need to talk to the landlord and explain to them that Chad isn't on the lease, he wasn't part of the original agreement, and if he doesn't go, you are (penalty free.) \n\n\nMy daughter just turned 20, and is going into her 3rd year of uni this year. This is the advice I'd give her, if she was in this situation. (Actually, she'd probably have *me* call the landlord for her lol)\n\n\nShe was actually going to live in a semi-similar situation this year, but thankfully she found other arrangements. \n\n\nThe difference is, my daughter is the one with the boyfriend, and everyone involved are REALLY good friends. \n\n\nThe problem is that the one roommate (the main roommate that found and rented the house,) was saying, basically, that if the boyfriend came over to the house EVER, he was going to have to pitch it for rent, utilities etc... which is kind of irksome to me, because she's not even one of those broke college kids, like my daughter and her boyfriend are. Her parents are rich, and pay for everything. So it seems like more of a control issue, than monetary. She's very controlling about other stuff too, to the point where, even before the boyfriend, I was begging her not to move in with this chick, as I knew major drama, and loss of friendship would be in their future.", "NTA.  Choosing roommates is difficult.  If he is going to be there then he can pay 1/4 and do 1/4 of all the chores.  Mama's boy will likely leave if you give him this ultimatum.", "NTA", "Yeah i thought about it BUT we are bound to our lease contract for at least one more year :\\`)", "If the lease can be altered to add Chad, it can be altered to replace you.", "Contact your landlord.  There are probably rules about guests/trying to sneak people onto the lesse", "If you feel you need to push it that far, you have solid grounds to break the lease without penalty on your end - your lease is probably very specific on who can stay there and likely has limits on how long guests can be there. \n\nIf Bea won't come around, take this to the landlord yourself (ideally with Sophie as well, if she has the same issues here as you).", "UPDATE\n\nI just had a long talk with Bea and i\u00b4ll try to summarise it here\n\nI told Bea that i was uncomfortable with having a fourth person living here, and she said she still didnt understand why i found it problematic as Chad is mostly in her room. Sophie eventually joined the discussion and said that she does not see the problem either. (She is friends with Chad). Again i brought up the fact that i did not agree to live with Chad, and the fact that he stays here all the time is exhausting as im constantly in fight or flight mode.\n\nI also tried to explain that its not just because he is the extra roomate, it is the fact that there IS an extra roommate! \n\nBea asked what i wanted to do, and i told her i did not want Chad to stay more than two nights a week. With this agreement he would be here 3/7 days a week,. She was NOT happy, and told me how upset and disappointed she was. (I cried)\n\nBoth her and Sophie asked if i\u00b4d change my mind if i got to know him, but i told them no. Bea then said she would try to limit it, but that she probably wouldnt stick to two nights a week. We all went silent, and the discussion ended with me saying i\u00b4ve told them everything i felt like i had to. Then i left.\n\nI should mention that Bea actually asked me if i wanted to live here. I told her i want to, but if Chad actually moves in he can pay my lease and i will find somewhere else. There is really bad tension between us rn.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMini update?\n\nAn hour after our talk our landlord came to answer some of our general questions. It was divine timing. He did ask about Chad as Bea had mentioned him, but bea said he would only be here a few times. Our landlord actually said that him being here had to be discussed amongst us, and that if there were any problems or disagreements we should let him know. \n\nAs things are right now i dont think i will do anything dramatic, but if anything happens with Chad or i have more talks with Bea i will make sure to update!", ">I kept quiet\n\nYTA.  Grow a spine.", "NTA- but Bea is. And Chad doesn't seem like a very good bf from what you've said. You have the right to be comfortable in your home. If I were you, I'd just take it to the landlord because you didn't sign up to live with a man and shouldn't be forced to. You can veto any decision about chad bc you're in the lease and he is not.  If you don't feel safe in your home you don't have to stay. There are ways to get out of a lease if that's the case but I'm sure your landlord would rather him stay away than you have a lawsuit for unsafe living conditions. It also depends where you live (country/ state). Look up the renters rights if you're in the US", "NTA  But it is unlilkey that you can win this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook at your lease, and what it says about guests. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU failed to agree on rules concerning guests - it is unlikely you will come to an agreement, now that you have moved in together. So find some other place to live, and talk to your landlord about chad taking over your lease, or you breaking the lease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can TRY to get the landlord to forbid it, but if there is nothing about it in your lease, that will be difficult.", "NTA. Maybe put the lego in his warm pillow. LOL. But. My advice to you. Get the landlord involved. Tell him directly that you are NOT happy with the BF moving in. Let him be the bad guy. Ask Sophie separately if she is happy about this situation. If she is also not happy, then both of you go to the landlord together. Two unhappy tenants outweigh one happy one. Keep repeating to Bea that you agreed to move in with her and Sophie. Period.", "Stand your ground. Maybe come to an agreement of how many days he\u2019s allowed to stay over. Get landlord involved if needed and say you are uncomfortable with an extra tenant and did not agree to it. NTA by far", ">It's not reasonable for Bea to inflict a stealth extra roommate on you\n\nRoommates who move in their SOs without asking are the absolute worst.", "\"I hope he steps on lego and that his pillow is always warm.\" \n\nI literally laughed out loud \ud83d\ude02", "\"2 nights week tops. And not all day, all night.\"  .... This is not how roommate agreements work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe REASONABLE thing is to make a WRITTEN contract BEFORE you sign the lease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince they did not do that, kicking chad out will not be easy.", "Well, let your landlord know how you feel. It sounds like they will take care of the issue right away.", "\"He did ask about Chad as Bea had mentioned him, but bea said he would only be here a few times. Our landlord actually said that him being here had to be discussed amongst us, and that if there were any problems or disagreements we should let him know.\"  WHY did you fail to use the opportunity to tell your landlord?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow YOU have effectively told the landlord you have no problem with chad being there, and that there are no problems. **Stupid. He ASKED YOU. And you made sure that your landlord understood there were no issues from your side with chad being there.**", "\"but I'm sure your landlord would rather him stay away than you have a lawsuit for unsafe living conditions. \" Bullshit. The landlord visited and ASKED if anybody had issues with Chad staying with them, and OP did not say anything. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will be documented as \"OP did not state any issues with chad staying with them when it was agreed on in presence of all lease holders. All leasoholders were explicitely asked if they had any reservations or issues, none were stated\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe LANDLORD is in the clear now. He can use this as evidence in any lawsuit. The landlord did his part.", "So talk to your landlord.\n\nASK him how to break the lease. Or offer for chad to take over your share of the lease.", "Yes, actually it IS how roommate agreements work. Where I live they can make it a standing rule that overnight guests can not exceed more than 2 nights a week. Or they owe rent. Because it runs up utilities.\n\nIt's also called common decency.\n\nYou don't need a timeline to start enforcing boundaries. She's had Chad over too much and now it's time to put a stop to him overstayed in a shared space.", "She did that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe landlord asked if there were any issues with chad, and OP did not say anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo this goes down as \"ALL agree, no problem with chad living there\".", "NTA. But you're going to have to bite the bullet and tell her how you feel. You don't have to tell her everything about how you hate him- but you do need to be honest. You didn't sign up to live with him and it's not fair of her to go behind y'alls backs and ask the landlord about him moving in. You and your other roommate and her need to sit down without Chad and have an honest conversation. Try to compromise- like 3 nights a week is ok, but no more than that, or something along those lines that you guys are all comfortable with. And him not being there if she's not, etc. If she's not happy with that, she can move out and move in with him. You can't be quiet anymore because she has no idea- so you have to be blunt and honest.", "NTA thats just as much as your apartment as hers. If you not comfortable she needs to respect that. Her and chad can find their own apartment if thats what she wants.", "NTA.  You moved in with 2 other women.  Not a man.  She can\u2019t just sneak him into the living situation.  Talk to the landlord.  Explain you need to know how to break the lease and explain why.  You did not agree to live with 3 other people.", "NTA. Not what you signed up for.", "Wait, so they trampled over your boundaries, and then the landlord comes over to ask you if you are okay with an extra house mate and you keep your mouth shut because you don\u2019t want to offend your house mates?\n\nA part of growing up is to stand up for yourself. No-one else is going to defend your interests.\n\nTime for some hard questions: why do you think they moved you in? Because they like you? Or because they needed a third person to pay the rent while they can also move in a friend of theirs who will not contribute?\n\nSo far they have not shown they like you very much by not taking your valid concerns into account.", "we all know Chad never planned on paying anything"]}
