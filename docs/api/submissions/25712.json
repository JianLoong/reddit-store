Its also worth noting that the walls are really thin, so having private conversations is close to impossible.\n\nI dont like Chad. Actually, i hate Chad with my entire beeing. I hope he steps on lego and that his pillow is always warm. I\u00b4ll explain why.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy friend Bea is the sweetest person. She is kind, caring, beautiful, funny and smart.  However, Bea has a pretty big flaw as she is a chronic people pleaser. This has brought her into quite a few toxic situationships, and its horrible seeing her allowing people to use her this way.\n\nChad came into the picture in january 2023. He attends the same classes as us, and they were introduced through a mutual friend. Chad only invited Bea over when he wanted intimacy, and if they saw each other in public he ignored her. Chad is a mamas boy, and has never had to work for anything in his life. When Bea would come over she ended up cooking for him, doing his laundry and cleaning, all while he ignored her and gamed. He was controlling and isolated Bea from her friends, and they always argued. This went on for months.\n\nBea and Chad became a couple in june, but because ive been in my hometown for a while i\u00b4ve not really met him.

One of the questions she asked was if our landlord wanted extra payment because Chad would be staying here a lot. ....What?\n\nI kept quiet, but as the days went by i became more uncomfortable. I wanted to talk about it alone, but Chad was always around. Saturday i sendt Bea a text where i told her i wasnt comfortable with Chad living here. She replied after several hours that she didnt see the problem. He usally stays in her room and i stay in mine. I told her i have bad social anxiety and im generally scared of men (thanks dad). I also said i agreed to move in with her and Sophie, not her, Sophie and Chad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe got annoyed, but asked if we could talk about it.

Like you say, you agreed to live with Bea and Sophie - not Bea, Sophie, and Chad.\n\nIt's normal for people to have boyfriends or girlfriends, and it's normal for them to stay the night from time to time. But when \"from time to time\" turns in to \"most of the time\", then that's rather a different prospect.", "NTA, but you might want to start looking for a new place.", "NTA.  You never agreed to run into Chad on your way to the bathroom in the middle of the night on the regular, and that's gonna happen.  And you absolutely have the right to NOT LIVE WITH A MAN, you didn't sign up for that.\n\nI'm not afraid of men, but never would have lived with one when I was single, I need privacy.", "*\"I also said i agreed to move in with her and Sophie, not her, Sophie and Chad.\"*\n\nThis is the heart of the matter right here and the only part that matters. While I'd certainly say Bea can have Chad visit, he should not be there regularly using the space that you are paying for. He's undoubtedly using the tv, the bathroom/shower, the kitchen, etc. By rights, you should have more time without him there than time with him there, period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"I hope he steps on lego and that his pillow is always warm.\"* \n\nOMG you're harsh!

Keep repeating: this is a problem even if you don\u2019t think so. And yes, he is that bad. Underhand way how things are done is proving just how difficult life with him would be.

This is the advice I'd give her, if she was in this situation.

Her parents are rich, and pay for everything. So it seems like more of a control issue, than monetary. She's very controlling about other stuff too, to the point where, even before the boyfriend, I was begging her not to move in with this chick, as I knew major drama, and loss of friendship would be in their future.", "NTA.  Choosing roommates is difficult.  If he is going to be there then he can pay 1/4 and do 1/4 of all the chores.

There are probably rules about guests/trying to sneak people onto the lesse", "If you feel you need to push it that far, you have solid grounds to break the lease without penalty on your end - your lease is probably very specific on who can stay there and likely has limits on how long guests can be there. \n\nIf Bea won't come around, take this to the landlord yourself (ideally with Sophie as well, if she has the same issues here as you)."]}
