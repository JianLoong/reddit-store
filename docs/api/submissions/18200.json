My sister (25F) is aware of this and has been hinting that she wants to borrow it for a road trip she's planning with her friends.\n\nNow, my sister has a history of being irresponsible with borrowed items.

I've expressed my concerns to her, but she insists that she'll be careful and promises to return it in the same condition.\n\nThe thing is, I don't fully trust her. I've seen her reckless driving habits and know how she treats her own car. Additionally, my car insurance doesn't cover other drivers, so if anything were to happen, I'd be left dealing with the consequences.\n\nWhen I declined her request, my sister became upset and accused me of being selfish and stingy. She argued that family should support each other, especially in times of need. Our parents are also pressuring me to let her borrow the car, claiming it's just a one-time favor.\n\nI feel torn.
