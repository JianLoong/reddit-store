If she really wants the car, rent it to her for the cost of the month of that premium. It actually may be lower than her getting a rental too.", "NTA. Don't let anyone borrow your car, nobody will treat it the same way as you and it will be returned with some scratches or marks where there were none. Let's not talk about the insurance issue which is a reason by it's own", "NO LENDING VEHICLES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE RECKLESS DRIVERS! \n\nDo not do it, OP.\n\nETA judgement: NTA", "NTA, they can buy or hire their own car.\n\nHowever, if you wanted to be \"nice\" and lend her the car. Get her to sign a contract that requires a \u00a3200 security deposit, makes her liable for any damages incurred, fuel used, and a flat rate price per mile used. Insurance is to be paid by her, so she drive it, if impounded for any reason she is to pay to get it out and for any temporary transport required in the mean time, while also having the car be professionally valeted at her expense after the trip is over... at her expense.\n\nIf she wants it that bad, she will have no problem signing it, but she will be legally bound by what's written, so make it picky and make sure there's no loopholes. I'm sure some lawyer on reddit would love to help with some small petty revenge.", "NTA\n\nI'm guessing she's not on your insurance? So even if you wanted to, you couldn't legally let her drive it.", "DO NOT GIVE HER YOUR CAR!!!\nYou cant be the only one in your family with a car if your Parents trust her so much then she can use their car or even her own car. Your car is your car and no Matter what you shouldn\u2019t let them pressure you into giving up if you\u2019re not comfortable doing so #NTA", "Nta. You paid for the car and she wouldn't be insured to drive it. Stick to what you said and if parents insist, say why don't you offer own car since you want to pressure me into offering mine up? It's non of their business anyway.", "NTA. That's your car and she's not insured to drive it. Why does she need your car if she has her own? You've worked hard for it, don't give it to someone who won't appreciate it.", "NTA\n\nDONT DO IT!!!! Given how you have described your sister, and that your insurance doesn't cover other drivers, if something happens do you think she will repay you? She doesn't sound like she will", "NTA, she has her own car, she can use it. Your insurance doesn't cover her so unless she's willing to pay for insurance that WILL cover her AND all gas and (if necessary) any damages not covered by the insurance she pays for, she's not touching your car in any position besides back seat passenger", "Even if she was the greatest driver in the world you\u2019d be under no obligation to lend her your car. NTA.", "YES THIS!\n\nEven if you actually wanted to loan your car to your sister, the fact that it wouldn't be covered by your insurance is absolutely a good reason to say no.", ">If she has a car, why does she want yours?\n\nProbably because OPs car is new and more nice than her own.\n\nWhich, tough luck, if she wants a car like OPs then save up for one.", "I thought the same thing. She has her own car she can drive. She doesn't need OP's car. Additionally, since it's a road trip with friends, they probably have their own cars. Why can't they do the driving? NTA", "Well said!  NTA.", "Why on earth should OP do that?!", "Tell her to a) rent a car b) Uber c) your parents can lend them their car. NTA", "I'd consider the car stolen if that happened. If the family wants to pull shit like that they can deal with the consequences."]}
