Like wait, how she treats HER car? So she has a car? Why does she need OPs?\n\nNTA. Also if your parents want to get on your case about lending it to her why don\u2019t they commit to footing the bill if she damages the car?

By wavering and considering it, you\u2019re rewarding them for pushing you harder. They will continue to escalate if they believe you will eventually cave, and they will probably make it harder and harder for you to say no in various ways. Is this a pattern in your household?  Either way, the only antidote is firm boundaries, but you must be prepared for whatever petty retaliation she can unleash, and for your parents to take her side. \n\nAn alternative would be to put VERY firm conditions on it. Eg, she pays you up front for the detail you will probably need to do when she returns. Her parents pay her insurance (I don\u2019t like this because it establishes her as an ongoing user of you car, but including it for your consideration.)  parents guarantee to pay for any damages (if you trust them to follow through.). Etc. \n\nAt you would have some control in this second scenario, but you will probably get returned a car that\u2019s scratched, dirty, and worse for the west in ways that will be hard to get recompense for. \n\nFwiw this would be an entirely different conversation if your sister was responsible and reliable and you guys had a history of helping each other out with things like this happily. \n\nNTA, obviously.", "not as fancy and cool. cause she treats it like shit. nta, don\u2019t lend her anything, this is not your parents business and they need to back off. don\u2019t leave your keys where any family members can reach them.", "And road trips are breeding grounds for driving mishaps ... driving for much longer periods at a time than usual, driving on unfamiliar roads, driving in areas that may have different traffic laws than your own, driving distracted (since you'll have a bunch of friends in the car having a good time), maybe driving in weather conditions you otherwise might stay home in, abnormal wear and tear (would they notice and take action if something needed service due to excessive driving) etc. \n\nOn top of all of that, even if you \\*did\\* trust your sister's driving and care of your car (which you don't), do you even know her friends and how \\*they\\* drive or would care for your car?
