Even though I promised her I would not talk about the wedding at her party, (and so did my parents, also nobody else knows about the wedding date yet), she's still calling me names whenever I'm around, and uninvited me from her birthday. My parents think I'm in the right, but my mother did tell me that I could've put the wedding for next year. \n\nMy boyfriend and I had a talk, and we decided that we don't want to wait a whole year for the next Halloween, but we had the idea to put it in november, and my sister still wasn't fine with it, so we decided to keep the late october date. \n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: Thank you kind people.

It's only a birthday party.\n\nShe needs to get over it.\n\nAre there other examples of such entitled behaviour you can regale us with?  Sounds like your mother might be a bit of an enabler and is playing you off against each other when she's telling you that you are right but you should've done it next year.\n\nI would consider downsizing your wedding and just having who you want at it.  Maybe throw a halloween party for yourself and invite who you want... then surprise... this is actually a wedding.  But just give the people you really want a heads up to make sure they are there and swear them to secrecy.

Whatever shall she do?\n\nTell the brat to get over it. It's the same *season* mind you, not the same day as her birthday. Her birthday is an entire month before your wedding. She gets to have her birthday and everyone waits a month before your big day. You even offered to wait two months after her birthday and make it on November and the brat is still complaining? She's legally a adult come September, tell her to get off her high horse and start acting like one. \n\nNTA. Enjoy your big day and best of luck to the newly wed couple! Also, don't stoop to her level and uninvite her from the wedding. You really want to make her upset, keep the invite to the wedding so she has to face everyone being happy for you two.
