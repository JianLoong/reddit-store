We get along pretty well and have never had any problems. \n\nAs part of our renters agreement with the landlord, we're only allowed one guest over at a time for a week max with the consent of the other roommate. So if I want to have a friend stay with me for a few days, my roommate has to agree and vice versa. We both have had friends over before and it's always gone over peacefully. We both also have had more than one friend over with no issues because we respected eachother's space and belongings. It's important to note here that I've only ever invited over other women, and he's only ever invited over other men. Our guests also stay in our own bedrooms.\n\n\nThree weeks ago, one of my friends, Mike (22M) needed a place to stay for three days because he was leaving an abusive partner. I asked my roommate if it was alright to have him over for those three days. I explained the sensitivity of the situation and I promised, as always, to cover any extra expenses caused by Mike being over. My roommate refused because he said he didn't feel comfortable with a man being invited over. I had no clue what he was talking about it and I was very annoyed, but I respected his choice. My friends and I put money together to get Mike a hotel room for those three days instead. \n\n\nToday, my roommate asked if he could have two friends over for Friday and the Weekend. I said no because it was against the renters rules. He was confused because we've both agreed to break the rules before, but I said to him that I didn't feel comfortable with two strange men over. He could tell straight away that I was doing it to annoy him because he didn't let Mike stay over, plus I have met the friends he was inviting over before. He told me to stop being childish because he has a right to refuse guests for being uncomfortable whereas I was doing it to be annoying. What's even more irritating is that he has met Mike before and they get along with eachother. He then said he'd invite them over anyway but I said I'd call the landlord if he did so. We got into an argument and he called me an asshole for threatening to call the landlord over this. I still don't think I'm wrong because I am allowed (in the agreement) to refuse guests for any reason but i would like an objective opinion.

The living arrangement has broken down and gotten to the point both are being petty. move on and stop making it into something it isn't.", "I was thinking that maybe he didn\u2019t want to get involved in a potential DVA situation.", "I think it is more that he felt that a man and woman were going to have pre-marital sex, and he felt entitled / duty-bound? to prevent it.", "It wasn't a strange man though, it was someone be already knew.", "Strange, if anyone should know not to put the woods in his mouth I would think it would be an Environmental Coach.", "Upvoted for the chuckle. Please don't edit!", "Yes, landlords can absolutely make rules about overnight guests and put them in the lease. It's their property, they can put whatever rules they want in the lease, if you don't like them don't sign the lease.", "This might be a bit harsh but... do you have a lock on your separate bedroom doors?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour roommate asking you to be okay with two extra guys staying in the apartment sounds kinda... suspicious about their intentions", "Oh! My state actually FORBIDS landlords from having that kind of power. Landlords are allowed to forbid guest staying for extended periods, but overnight guests are completely allowed. Found this out because there's a crazy landlord in my county that's so famous, they have a whole Facebook group dedicated to her. I asked about renting and she told me \"Remember when you were 14 and lived with your parents? That's what I'm going to be like.\" Like I'd paid $500+ to be treated like a child? She's also under investigation for discrimination for race and disabled and misusing government funds. Can't wait to see how this plays out.", "The way you're using \"uncomfortable\", I would go further and use the word \"unsafe.\"  These are guys that you just really didn't feel safe being around, once you had met them.\n\nOP's roommate apparently was \"uncomfortable\" because Mike was a guy and visiting his female roommate in her room.  This is worlds apart.", "I think reasonable people can disagree over whether the roommate is responsible for everyone else's decision to put Mike up in a hotel and whether the roommate should really be responsible for that.  If you disagree with me there, fine - I'm sure you won't be the only one.  \n\nHowever, the rest of your comment is frankly off base.  You don't have to be poor to not be able to afford to start living in a hotel at a moment's notice.  This guy is likely in his early 20s and wouldn't have much savings.  And on top of that - abusive relationships absolutely make this kind of thing a bigger problem because when a relationship is abusive, one way that abuse often manifests is financially.  So, yeah, the relationship might have affected Mike's financial situation.  And I feel that part wouldn't have been questioned if the story switched to have Mike as a woman.\n\nAnd OP and her friends DID pay for Mike's hotel room.  So no, Mike obviously needed the help.", "So\u2026. You aren\u2019t allowed male guests. Are you straight? Like, will he try and stop you having a partner over? Is he perhaps a little jealous? Like he might be cock blocking?", "Why was he uncomfortable though? Because it\u2019s a man he has met before.", "This is a bot account that is reposting half of a comment someone else made in the thread, \n\nReport - spam - harmful bots.", "Whatever he is, he's being very goofy?", "You mentioned that your guests sleep in your room and that, so far, you only had female friends over. Any chance your roommate has a thing for you? So he's \"uncomfortable\" bc he's afraid you'll sleep with your male friend.", ">It's their property, they can put whatever rules they want in the lease\n\nThey can put whatever they want, but if it conflicts with local, state, or federal laws it won't be binding.  \n\n\ne.g. https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/guest-policies", "That\u2019s not correct for many places in the world. Landlords cannot make any rules about guests in my province and even if they do (and you sign the lease as such even) they\u2019re immediately void in the eyes of the law.", "Absolutely wrong. Landlords pack leases with rules and stipulations that aren\u2019t actually valid all the time. Guest rules are a major example of this in most municipalities.", "I've met the guys twice before and they seem nice but I do have a lock on my door jic", "Yes, if you read my full comment you'd see where I say that this is likely not such a situation.\n\nAnd I didn't feel \"unsafe\", I felt \"uncomfortable\". I felt unsafe *after*, when everything had gone down. In the moment I felt uncomfortable; like I had  ordered food and realized I'd forgotten my wallet, like I had bit into an ear of corn but it had the texture and consistency of jello, like I was wearing a shirt with too much starch, like my toenail had snagged just before the toe of my sock and I didn't have time to fix it. Uncomfortable.", "How is that the roommates problem?", "Probably thought OP and Mike were going  to have sex because a man and a woman can't share a bedroom without sex happening. /s", "1000%. His attitude is ridiculous.", "There are more countries than just USA\u2026 (fortunately)", "Do your research, a simple google search will confirm that landlords absolutely can restrict guests. They can put whatever rules they want it the lease and as long as it doesn't violate ADA or another law it is enforceable \n\nNot all states allow landlords to ban overnight guests, but some do. All they have to do is put it in the rental agreement, which is exactly what this landlord did", "I'm glad you have a lock on your door", "Yeah ... I get you.  I will admit, it was hard to find the right words for #2.  Part of the problem I'm now realizing is that the way OP's roommate used the word \"uncomfortable\" was wrong.  Your kind of uncomfortable is fully valid because it's specific.  \"I feel uncomfortable around this guy, I don't want him around me\" is a valid reason. \n\nThe point I was trying to make is that roommates should let each other have guests and only object for a good reason - that's something that should be used very sparingly.", "Because the roommate refused Mike's chance to stay there based on \"feeling uncomfortable\" about him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhich as other commenters have said, could be anything ranging from the roommate having a crush on OP and not wanting another man in her room, or the roommate trying to control OP", "it\u2019s not. But roomie caused the extra expense and if she wants it back then she\u2019s entitled to it before approving guests.", "Yea, I'm fully sure OP's roommate was using uncomfortable as an excuse, but with no way to pop into his mind and go \"see, you liar!\" we (and OP) have to accept his uncomfort as a truth, or else accept him over-vetoing our/OP's uncomfort by the same grounds. (Yes I'm saying uncomfort instead of discomfort on purpose lol) Society only functions when founded upon a basic understanding of decency. They should allow each other's guests... but as roommate vetoed an *emergency situation* for OP I have no issue with OP vetoing roommates \"fun 2 guest hangout\", like, if an emergency isn't allowed why is fun (but I am petty and would know I'm the AH)"]}
