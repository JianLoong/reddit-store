I completely understand your nephew not wanting anyone to hold his premature newborns, especially during a pandemic. Your sisters are missing out on getting to know the twins and it's their own damn fault. If they chose not to speak to you because you refuse to take sides, then that's on them. I would just continue to say, \"this feud is ridiculous and I will not take sides.\"", "NTA you're allowed to be kind to whoever you want.\n\n>She says I'm not being a loyal sister. \n\nlmao that would just make me ask her, \"How are you being a loyal sister by demanding an ultimatum?\"", "NTA asking you to chose is petty. Have you tried talking to your sister yo make her see your pov?", "NTA - newborns are highly at risk for illness when first born, Premature newborns even more so. Premature newborns at the time of a global pandemic killing or permanently effecting people\u2019s health for life is just another layer of why would you even want to risk them.\n\nSome family members especially grandparents seem to think they\u2019re above rules. It\u2019s really unfortunate, I couldn\u2019t live with myself if I knew I caused an innocent baby health issues.\n\nWe met our friends premature baby 4 months after she was born (1 month corrected) in Covid and we respected anything the parents wanted and didn\u2019t go one time as we were sick and a day and abit later after we met her my husband started to feel Covid symptoms and as he waited for his test results he cried thinking he would have to tell our friends he exposed her to Covid. He thankfully wasn\u2019t and it was just a cold but I can\u2019t fathom people who didn\u2019t understand how scary those times would be for new parents. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate she\u2019s demanding you pick a side but I think your nephew deserves an aunt/female family member on his side. And your sister has proven she is unreasonable, I\u2019d not want to deal with that.", "NTA and thanks for being one healthy, supportive family member for your poor nephew and his GF. I\u2019ve recently become a Grandma at 49 and also had a baby at the beginning of covid (when I was 45 - so yeah - I\u2019m just crazy lol\u2026 oldest is 28, youngest is 4) and they were doing exactly what the hospital told them to do with their babies.\n\nIt is so sad when a new baby comes how some family make it all about themselves rather than being proud that two young people are doing their best to be great parents and set boundaries based on what MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS recommend!\n\nJust to add, my 10yo daughter was a preemie and my mom lied about getting her pertussis booster (and is a smoker and also lied about quitting). She came to meet my daughter, and we noticed her stifling a cough about 10mins into her visit. \n\nWe were in urgent care and then the ER 3-4 days later and our little girl had pertussis (whooping cough), was on oxygen and went home with a nebulizer for a month because we didn\u2019t enforce the \u201cnobody holds the baby for the first bit\u201d rule \u201cbecause she was my mom.\u201d We\u2019re NC with my mom now. That was one of the scariest times I\u2019ve had as a mom!", "I mean by \"not taking sides\" you are implicitly taking the nephew's side. Which you 100% should because fucking covid. Medical advice should be adhered to and 'feelings' does not make one exempt from the rules-to-stay-alive-by. Be your nephew's (clearly) only healthy support system among the sisters and tell your sisters you'll be here and ready when they want to speak again.", "At last! Parents who refused to let their unvaccinated newborn be exposed to everybody's germs and really held to it. (Apparently.)\n\nI applaud them. They're smart.\n\nDon't worry about your sister and her feud. Who cares? Let her stew in her juices, if it makes her happy.

Your relationship with your nephew and his GF is your business and separate from that with your sister.  No one should be directing you as to whom you are allowed to socialize with in your family.  Do as you see fit and let your sister's drama play out as she chooses.  Maybe she should follow your example, who knows.", "NTA.\n\nThank goodness your nephew has a supportive aunt like you. Your sister should not be throwing out an ultimatum, she should be working on gaining forgiveness for her terrible behavior. How fortunate that you get to see the twins grow up.", "NTA. Never take the side of the manipulative one", "Nta. Tell her to grow up.", ">  Now my sister is telling me I need to choose between my nephew and his gf or her.

You don't have to be a \"loyal sister\" when she's wrong.", "NTA.  It\u2019s nearly always the person issuing an ultimatum that\u2019s an asshole and your sister is no exception.", "NTA", "NTA -\n\nYour sister's expectations of blind loyalty are unreasonable, considering the following:\n\n1. The request your nephew's gf made sounds very reasonable, especially since the babies were premature AND during COVID.  \n2. You don't agree with your Sister's opinion that what the GF did was wrong. \n3. YOU personally have no issue with nephew & GF as they have been fine with you (and you probably respect their boundaries - unlike your sister.)\n\nI'd tell your sister that you understand that she is upset she was not involved in her grandchildren's birthday - but does she really want to enforce you to be estranged and cut off your nephew and his family without cause?  Doing that will NOT make them rush to have her in their lives, no matter what she thinks.  Does she also want to be estranged from you as well because you wouldn't do what she wants? \n\nI'd also point out the irony here - she is estranged because she was unhappy about a (reasonable) rule that she was asked to abide by and does not feel it is fair that she is now being left out.  But she is willing to be estranged from you if you don't follow an arbitrary rule that she sets. \n\nI am assuming that your sister has exhibited many questionable \"JustNO\" behaviors (such as boundary stomping) that upsets your nephew and his GF. \n\nPlease don't enable your sister to continue this controlling, unreasonable behavior by catering to her demands.  She is being unreasonable.", "Okie dokie, I'd happily say, BYE GIRL!!  Loyalty? Seriously? Hates a young Mom because she wanted to protect her premature babies during Covid?
