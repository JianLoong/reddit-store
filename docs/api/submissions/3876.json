Make plans with her, say you'll help with X, Y, and Z.  Have her make plans which depend upon you showing up.\n\nThen, don't.  Keep stringing her along with lies saying you'll be there presently, etc.  If she challenges you about lying - and she will - tell her you learned it from her and your dad.  And ***don't*** go home for Christmas.  And ***don't*** believe anything they tell you from now on.  I just can't believe some parents.  (Am a mom and GMa)", "I\u2019m so glad to hear that! It\u2019s easy to get manipulated and gaslit sometimes but we are always here! \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b", "Well when you make decisions like that, this is how everyone else will interpret your reasoning.

I don\u2019t want to stoop to that level. I\u2019d rather get \u201crevenge\u201d by getting success."]}
