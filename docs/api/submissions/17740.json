If she responds before the leaving time,  but isn't ready to leave by 15 minutes after your stated leaving time, then text her that you're leaving and she should meet you at the festival.

She is an adult and makes her choices.  If she wants to party until breakfast that is her privilege.  You have plans to go to a festival and should go.  Give her a call about an hour before you are suppose to leave. She will either answer or not.   Let her know you are leaving in an hour if she wants you to pick her up, let you know.  Choice is hers, but she isn\u2019t allowed to get angry with you because you are sticking to the schedule.\n\nMy sister and I were going to a festival, she mentioned it to a few of her friends a few weeks before the event.  Most said no, one said she wanted to go.  Never asked about it again.   She apparently called my sister at 10 pm the night before to ask if sister was still going.   Sister was already asleep and didn\u2019t see the message until she got up at 5 am.  Sent a text and said she was leaving at 6:30 and if friend still wanted to join us, call and we would swing by and pick her up.   All I said was WTF?   And not to worry about no-show friend.  Obviously she was on the fence about going or not.", "NTA.  Go to the festival and enjoy every moment.  Your friend has deprived herself of the experience.  There is no reason for you to also be deprived.\n\nI hope you keep this in mind when making future plans with this person.", "NAH. She was good to tell you she'd be laggy.", "NTA.  \"Keep in mind we've had these plans for months.\"  I say, it depends how much you want to have her along.  But she knew about the plans when she decided to stay out until 4 am AND, it's not that big a deal to get up on time even if you were out to the wee hours.\n\nDo what you want to do, it's on her.", "Oh I definitely will!

As unfortunate as it would be for her to miss it, it would be her own fault anyway. But you shouldn't have to miss something fun because she was irresponsible with her time and choices. I would be curious to see an update when you have one.", "She knew what the plans were and chose to go out drinking till 4 am. Go without her and have fun. NTA"]}
