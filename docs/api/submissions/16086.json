Yes, his marriage is \"heterosexual\" but when people say things assuming he's straight, he is quick to correct them because that's not who he is.

It sounds like she\u2019s conflating two important events in her life, her wedding and her coming to terms with her sexuality.

Nobody cares about your past partners or what gender they were. Also I\u2019m not an expert but I\u2019m pretty sure you aren\u2019t born a lesbian and then \u201c become \u201c bisexual. Plenty of women who marry men are bisexual. They don\u2019t feel compelled to divulge their past sexual history at their wedding.. to me , this is the only weird part about this community.

Having sex with men is being unfaithful to your relationship.  \n\nThis issue is so she will later tell you and everyone else that she made her status and intentions clear before the wedding.  She is getting you positioned to accept her future sexual infidelity because she is bi and if you don\u2019t accept her right to future male partners, you are being bi phobic. \n\nThere isn\u2019t any other reason for her to want to make this a feature of your wedding.  \n\nCan you put a hold on the wedding u til and unless she can declare her intention to be faithful to you.", "NTA\n\nway I see it is this is akin to me for example talking about how I realized I'm really attracted to blondes and I'm marrying someone with black hair\n\nit's just weird and low key disrespectful in general", "NTA.

Having a space for being bi and proud of it is important. I know this feeling and this need very well.

If so, she could say, \u201cAs a bisexual woman, I have about 7 billion options for a spouse and you are the special person I want to spend the rest of my life with.\u201d  It gets the point across while still keeping the focus on the marriage.\n\nETA:  That number is exactly accurate, but the math can be included later.", "This is a slap in the face to the other bride.

If you're both having a more casual, less traditional wedding, and the speeches are less \"speeches in front of a crowd\" and more, \"sharing a story with a small group of friends and family\", I can see more aspects of storytelling coming into play. Especially if you're sharing a story about how you two met. Part of her lifes story is realising that she is bi. After she realised that, at some point you two became a happy couple. It's a clearly defined chapter in her journey, and I'd understand why she would want to mention it as part of how you two came together. Storytelling allows for ebbs and flows, mentions and remembrances, climax and resolution. You mentioned she 'focused' on it at the beginning of the speech - and then what? Any intense detail? Did she move on quickly? Was the following 4/5ths of the speech about you?\n\nIf it's like \"I was gay but then I realised how hot men were and I dated heaps of men and had heaps of hetero sex, here's a bunch of detail on those hetero-passing relationships, and then I eventually dated my wife, the end\" then yeah, you should be pretty annoyed. \n\nBut if it's something like \"I was a lesbian for many years, sure in my identity, but then I had an identify crisis and realised I might be bi so I explored that side of myself for a couple years and my now wife supported me through it all as one of my closest friends. It turns out my forever person was by my side that whole time and now we're getting married and I couldn't be happier in my choices\" then you've just got a nice story with some plot twists. \n\nI'm probably projecting a little, but trying to provide another perspective for you to consider. I'm bi and going to marry a woman - the first woman I've ever properly dated. I'm so so happy to be by her side, but my 'male' years defined me as a person before she met me. It would be almost impossible to pretend that wasn't a part of my story, or the story of how we met. So if I wanted to tell a story about my life, or about how we met, I'd probably mention men here or there.\n\nUltimately it comes down to how much you trust and love your partner - do you think she's saying these things to convince people she's been with men? What's her M.O. to 'focus' on these things? To hurt you? To assert her identity? Get to the bottom of her want to include this part of her story, and get to the bottom of why this is bothering you too. If it's more of a mention than a 2 paragraph detailed thesis on men, why is a mention causing you to come to the internet rather than talking to your fiance? If it's 2 paragraphs, why can't you communicate your discomfort and feelings of disrespect openly to her? Does she respect your opinion and feelings and would be amenable to removing 2/3rds of her 2 paragraphs? \n\nWish the best for you both! I think it can be resolved with a bit of honest, loving communication.", "Maybe she ought to focus on her marriage and her partner instead of making her sexuality her identity.", "I could see a compromise of the bi-wife mentioning her bi identity discovery in her speech, but bringing it back to the point of focussing on who she\u2019s marrying. She could talk about the journey of discovering she\u2019s bi, feeling supported and loved (or whatever other true positive emotions) by OP as bi-wife explored what that discovery meant to her, and how she\u2019s now sure that OP-wife is the perfect spouse for her.  Or how OP-wife truly allows her to blossom or gives her space to know herself and be an individual, or whatever feels authentic there.
