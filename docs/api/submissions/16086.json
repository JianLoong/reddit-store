Yes, his marriage is \"heterosexual\" but when people say things assuming he's straight, he is quick to correct them because that's not who he is.

Nobody cares about your past partners or what gender they were. Also I\u2019m not an expert but I\u2019m pretty sure you aren\u2019t born a lesbian and then \u201c become \u201c bisexual.

If so, she could say, \u201cAs a bisexual woman, I have about 7 billion options for a spouse and you are the special person I want to spend the rest of my life with.\u201d  It gets the point across while still keeping the focus on the marriage.\n\nETA:  That number is exactly accurate, but the math can be included later.", "This is a slap in the face to the other bride.

If you're both having a more casual, less traditional wedding, and the speeches are less \"speeches in front of a crowd\" and more, \"sharing a story with a small group of friends and family\", I can see more aspects of storytelling coming into play. Especially if you're sharing a story about how you two met. Part of her lifes story is realising that she is bi. After she realised that, at some point you two became a happy couple. It's a clearly defined chapter in her journey, and I'd understand why she would want to mention it as part of how you two came together. Storytelling allows for ebbs and flows, mentions and remembrances, climax and resolution. You mentioned she 'focused' on it at the beginning of the speech - and then what? Any intense detail? Did she move on quickly? Was the following 4/5ths of the speech about you?\n\nIf it's like \"I was gay but then I realised how hot men were and I dated heaps of men and had heaps of hetero sex, here's a bunch of detail on those hetero-passing relationships, and then I eventually dated my wife, the end\" then yeah, you should be pretty annoyed. \n\nBut if it's something like \"I was a lesbian for many years, sure in my identity, but then I had an identify crisis and realised I might be bi so I explored that side of myself for a couple years and my now wife supported me through it all as one of my closest friends. It turns out my forever person was by my side that whole time and now we're getting married and I couldn't be happier in my choices\" then you've just got a nice story with some plot twists. \n\nI'm probably projecting a little, but trying to provide another perspective for you to consider. I'm bi and going to marry a woman - the first woman I've ever properly dated. I'm so so happy to be by her side, but my 'male' years defined me as a person before she met me. It would be almost impossible to pretend that wasn't a part of my story, or the story of how we met. So if I wanted to tell a story about my life, or about how we met, I'd probably mention men here or there.\n\nUltimately it comes down to how much you trust and love your partner - do you think she's saying these things to convince people she's been with men? What's her M.O. to 'focus' on these things? To hurt you? To assert her identity? Get to the bottom of her want to include this part of her story, and get to the bottom of why this is bothering you too. If it's more of a mention than a 2 paragraph detailed thesis on men, why is a mention causing you to come to the internet rather than talking to your fiance? If it's 2 paragraphs, why can't you communicate your discomfort and feelings of disrespect openly to her? Does she respect your opinion and feelings and would be amenable to removing 2/3rds of her 2 paragraphs? \n\nWish the best for you both!

Any speech at a wedding about how you discovered your attraction to anyone other than your partner is inappropriate. Personally, even a speech about discovering your sexuality is weird if it doesn't relate to your partner because a wedding just isn't the right time or place. Her speech should be about you or your relationship. Maybe family and friends as well. That's it. I'd sit down with her and talk about this because it sounds like she isn't comfortable with her sexuality or hasn't fully accepted it.", "uh.... at your WEDDING?????? lmao that's so damn RUDE.\n\ntalking about your attraction to others at your wedding is horrifically tacky and cruel to your SO, who is the one you're supposed to be celebrating your union with.\n\nweddings are not coming out parties they're celebrations of a relationship.\n\nNTA and i would refuse to marry them personally that is some awful snubbing I would never put up with.", "YTA. Not surprised to see a bunch of people saying otherwise though. If you aren't bi (and especially if you aren't queer), then you don't know how invalidating society can be (and is). It likely is not just about discussing past partners--its about discussing her very identity.", "NTA. I'm bi and it just seems useless to focus on it much during your wedding? Like the of hand joke: of all the men and women on the planet it turns out I love you the most. Yeah sure, but your wedding is about your relationship not about being gay or bi. Mentioning it should be fine, focussing on it is too much imo.", "NTA\n\nfeels like some IAmTheMainCharacter business. it's not the right time.", "NTA. Bi-erasure is a big thing, and your fianc\u00e9 probably feels the impending vindication of all the people who have erased that identity for her. That said, your wedding isn\u2019t the best place for this. Congratulations on your impending wedding. I hope you both have a wonderful day.", "I can understand the impact getting married has on someone\u2019s sexual identity. I\u2019m a Bi woman, but I married a man. It will therefore be people\u2019s assumption that I\u2019m straight.\n\nShe can grapple with that, and find ways to be true to herself - ie, make sure to correct people in one-on-one conversations.\n\nTotally not appropriate to do it as a part of her wedding speech. This is about you guys as a couple. It\u2019s not ok for either partner to hijack it and talk about something that only concerns them.\n\nIf she is feeling insecure of what the public perception of her will be, then that\u2019s something she needs to talk through and get affirmation that getting married doesn\u2019t change her sexual identity. She just happens to be marrying a woman.", "NTA. This is confusing and I felt uncomfortable reading your post. Maybe some questions to ask her- how does she think people will react on the day? What is the purpose of her making clear she still likes men via the speech? How does that particular point having any bearing which is relevant to it being YOUR wedding, together, as two women? Bi erasure is real and I can understand her wanting to be clear about who she is. But either way she\u2019s choosing to settle down with a woman so it seems conflicting to press the point about still being attracted to men at the wedding. Is that the best place for it?! I\u2019d like to hear what other bisexuals think about it.", "NTA.  Taking about your sexuality, especially when it doesn't include your new spouse, it is frankly really weird and strange.  Unless she is advertising your open relationship to people present, this really isn't an appropriate place to discuss her bisexuality.  It almost sounds like she wants to distance herself from a committed relationship with you.  Good luck.", "NTA and I also think that\u2019s she might only be a bit of the AH. I wonder if maybe she\u2019s worried she\u2019s losing her identity as bi if she marries a woman. She might feel the same if she was marrying a guy. It\u2019s almost like pigeon holing yourself when that\u2019s not who your truly are. \n\nI agree, her wedding speech is not the place to explore this but maybe she needs to be honest with herself and you about how marriage is making her feel", "I read the title and I was all for giving you the worst, and the reason why I don\u2019t talk about being bi because biphobia in the community is awful.  However, I was wrong, that\u2019s weird of your future wife, and you are most definitely NTA here. Weddings are for celebrating the couple and for the life they will be living together, not the past sexual history, it certainly doesn\u2019t belong in a wedding speech.", "NTA.\n\nI don't know why people feel a need to make public speeches about their sexual preferences, history, and/or inclinations.", "\"FYI I also love cock\"\n\nNTA", "NTA - Wedding speeches are the time to talk about your future together, what led you here to this point, your love for the other person, thanking your families, stuff you do TOGETHER, not yourself as an individual and your sexuality. Save it for her birthday party when the spotlight is on her and her alone. To be honest I find it really sad that she wants to use your wedding to talk about herself and her sexuality rather than honouring you and your relationship together, and that when you express your discomfort she accuses you of bigotry :(", "This.\n\nMaybe if it was a partner of many years who passed, it might be less weird to acknowledge the loss.\n\nBut any mention of casual dating other people or exes in general? Nah. In the same way that couples shouldn't be mentioning \"that time we were on a break for six weeks\" or any of their relationship drama.\n\nA wedding speech isn't about your dating journey, it's about the destination.\n\nI agree that it would be weird to mention she was bi because its irrelevant.  Shes not marrying a man and woman, shes marrying a woman. I have bi friends as well as questioning myself at times, it's definitely a part of life that is important.  But when you're committing to one partner in front of a crowd  it genuinely does not matter what other people you fucked in the past or who you might theoretically fuck if you were free.", "This is it.\n\nI'm not heterosexual. My wedding to my husband was not the time or the place to be talking about my sexuality to be \"open\" about it.\n\nA wedding is about your union, OP. I can imagine a lot of guests would be really confused by this, and would be wondering why she's focusing on being bisexual opposed to her marriage to you.", "I'm non monogamous and even once I marry I'll likely still entertain intimacy with people other than my spouse. I still wouldn't mention any of them, even if I was actively involved with them, in my wedding speech to my main partner. That day and moment is about *that* partner.", "I think the issue here is that people are often biphobic and want to completely rewrite a bi person's identity when they marry. I don't know how many times people will say \"Oh, you married a guy? That means your straight.\" No, no it doesn't.\n\nI'm on the fence with this for that reason. No, it's not the appropriate venue, but at the same time it seems she wants to address everyone who keeps being biphobic to her to stop being so just because she's getting married.", "Could you have a little 'who would you do' section of the wedding for both parties?", "100% agree it\u2019s just blatantly weird to talk about your exes at your wedding", "It's a Season 3 Tina Kennard-level choice.", "I'm bi and even I find it really weird.", "\"When I first realised my attraction to brunettes, that was a huge revelation to me, and it led to some fun, romantic years. I still like blondes though, as you can all see, heh heh. But, you know, brunettes are dear to me and will always have a special place in my heart.\"\n\nUm, yeah, wow.", "The couple have given a speech at every single wedding I've ever been to. Is this not a thing in the US?", "Finally! a post that actually understands the situation rather than assuming all bi people are cheating dogs", "It feels like she is using the wedding to celebrate her own identity, when it should be about celebrating each other and being a couple. There is nothing wrong with her being proud and happy about being comfortable in her own skin, but there\u2019s a time and place to do that and this isn\u2019t it.", "\u201cOP is perfect for me, but I can\u2019t help remember the day that I found out that I just looooove cock, you know? Like, I love cock so much that I feel compelled to speak about it in my wedding speech to a woman. So if you all find out I relapsed and went for some side dick, you can\u2019t say you\u2019re surprised\u201d", "I've not heard it done well though... did the times you heard it did it come across well?", "I thought this too it almost seems like she\u2019s trying to announce to the men present that they have a shot too. I hope that\u2019s not the case", "I love that you used the word tomfoolery. I love that word, and kind of hate that it's basically died out.  \n\nI would also have accepted describing this behavior as mayhem and foolishness or plain old-fashioned horseshit.", "Agree. I just don't see how it fits in to the day, unless there is a relevant story to the couple's 'love story' or relationship. I am a lesbian and nonbinary and both of those identities are REALLY important to me but certainly didn't come up in our wedding at all, other than maybe a little bit in our private vows? We're also polyam and again, didn't come up. We custom-wrote our ceremony and while we aren't publicly out about being polyam/nonmonogamous to the family, nor were we interested in doing that to the whole extended family haha, we did tailor it to not be all about 'one true love' or 'yours forever and forsake all others'! I think that there are ways one can feel affirmed at one's wedding in ways that feel good for everyone and are not a distraction. \n\nIt sounds like your fiance is having concerns about biphobia maybe from attendees, and I'm sure that's not unwarranted. Maybe try validating these concerns and expressing care about wanting to support her. Express that you understand the importance of her coming into this identity and that in no way do you ever expect her to hide it or diminish her bisexuality. (if that's true. i hope it's true!) Propose that you two, as a team, or maybe with your wedding party if you're having friends/family help plan, try to brainstorm other ways of expressing and affirming her bi identity in the day in a way that feels good and doesn't distract from the two of you. By 'feels good' I mean - it seems to me that this is coming from a place of defensiveness on your fiance's part. An urge to defend and point out that she is bi and will continue to be once married to you. This is stemming from like.. not a super joyful place, yknow what i mean? I know for me, I try not to make big decisions about my identity and stuff from a place of concern for what others think of me and how they perceive me. this is YALLS wedding day! It should be about YOU and your joy and happiness and love, not spend a second trying to prove anything to any jerks in the audience. I mean, at least for me, I don't want to do that. I didn't want my wedding day to be anything about explaining or having to prove anything to anyone. If someone didn't understand us then I expected them to keep that s\\*\\*\\* to themselves and for me to not hear about it! \n\nI think *your point is not an asshole thing*, but *it's entirely possible* you didn't express it in a super great way and *it came across in an asshole way to your fiance*. Planning a wedding is stressful. Hang in there, and don't let the things like this get in the way of your love. Talk about it. Focus on each other. If she really needs this, let her write it. Maybe she just needs to write it out in a letter, but maybe not. Give it a couple weeks and see how she's feeling. Wishing you strength in the wedding planning process!", "Yep.", "History is fine, but to make it a cornerstone of a wedding is creepy and, yes, foretelling.", "This would be a good way of going about it. The current message of, \"Hey, I'm marrying this person, but don't forget I'm also attracted to men,\" doesn't feel like the energy anyone should want to bring to their wedding.

The wedding is about the two of you, not her sexual history, FFS.", "Jesus, this comment is so gross.\n\nNot only you used the good ol' \"bi people are cheaters\" stereotype, but you also sexualized the whole thing by making it about genitals. \n\nFun fact: attraction to men is more than loving their cocks.", "This. It's not about denying her sexuality.  It's just that at your wedding the ONLY thing that matters is not who you fucked in the past, or who you might theoretically fuck if you were available but the one partner in front of you.", "I\u2019m bi and unless there\u2019s context I\u2019m not seeing, this isn\u2019t biphobia.", "i agree with you whole heartedly. literally any other context or time could be justified BESIDES the literal wedding with your wife.", "Pretty sure they were being ironic.", " \nNTA. Having a space for being bi and proud of it is important. I know this feeling and this need very well. Her marriage to you and your wedding is not the place.", "  Can\u2019t she just talk about discovering being being bi, instead of going into depth about liking men too? And no this doesn\u2019t make me biphobic!", "Ironic in the sense that they exaggerated OP's soon to be wife's speech to prove a point, sure.\n\nThey still did it in a pretty shitty way using biphobic stereotypes.", "They were friends at the time it would make sense this way. I mean, unless they do traditional vows she could put it in her vows.", "Do you two have the same vet by any chance?", "I\u2019m honestly just impressed they\u2019ve managed to keep that info away from the media"]}
