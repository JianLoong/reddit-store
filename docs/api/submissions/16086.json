I'm a cis woman, my husband is a cis man, but he's bisexual.  Yes, his marriage is \"heterosexual\" but when people say things assuming he's straight, he is quick to correct them because that's not who he is.

Nobody cares about your past partners or what gender they were. Also I\u2019m not an expert but I\u2019m pretty sure you aren\u2019t born a lesbian and then \u201c become \u201c bisexual.

Having a space for being bi and proud of it is important. I know this feeling and this need very well.

I\u2019m guessing not", "Doesn't matter what the guests feel its what the bride wants.", "No its not she is talking about her life at her wedding", "She\u2019s the one reducing her identity \u201calso into dick\u201d and I say that as a bisexual woman. \n\nNo one at her wedding cares if she\u2019s bi. \n\nSave it for the Pride Parade where anyone actually gives a damn.", "There are two brides and they both matter equally.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if the other bride is afraid that her bisexuality will be erased in the minds of the guests because she\u2019s marrying a woman and she\u2019s trying to make a point of saying she\u2019s still bisexual.  If so, she could say, \u201cAs a bisexual woman, I have about 7 billion options for a spouse and you are the special person I want to spend the rest of my life with.\u201d  It gets the point across while still keeping the focus on the marriage.\n\nETA:  That number is exactly accurate, but the math can be included later.", "This is a slap in the face to the other bride. Her wants matter too", "Yeah, but like, usually wedding speeches are explicitly about a couple and their relationship and love...  if realizing she liked men made her do something that ended in her meeting OP, or realizing that OP was \"the one\" okay...  but otherwise it's weird.  You don't give a short synopsis of your whole life in a wedding speech, the topic is usually quite focused on your partner.\n\nIf OP's speech is about how when she was strictly a lesbian, she only ever went to certain bars, and when she realized she was bi she wanted to try out some new places, and it just happened that she met her partner at one of those bars she only went to because she was looking for men, but found a woman instead...  that would be a cute speech.\n\nSounds like this isn't that though.", "No she is very clearly talking about how important being attracted to men is and that is not okay at all at a wedding. You shouldn\u2019t want to talk about anything that doesn\u2019t directly involve you and your fianc\u00e9 or your journey of finding eachother, her being bi has 0 relevance to their wedding, talking about how hot men is not relevant to their wedding and talking about how being attracted to people other than your partner during your wedding is disrespectful and inappropriate. I am bi and there\u2019s not a hope in hell I would talk about how important it is that I\u2019m attracted to women as well, while toasting the marriage to a man. The wedding is not just about Ops fianc\u00e9 and her sexuality, it\u2019s about both of them together and talking about how meaningful it is wanting to be with men is trashy and cruel.", "Hey, just wanted to add some detail on the speech. I\u2019m not sharing the whole thing- it isn\u2019t an \u2018I like dick\u2019 speech, but she does talk about her journey of discovering she liked guys, and going out with them/being in straight relationships. While there are some reasons behind this- a lot of our friends are lesbians, so I get that it\u2019s important for her to not get boxed in or assumed to be one, the speech reads like she\u2019s marrying a man.", "pretty cool that a bi person is reducing bisexuality to attraction to genitals, nothing wrong with that at all", "Thats talking about her bisexuality\n\nHow is that # accurate?", "No its not. She wants to talk about her life at HER wedding", "No matter what the reasons she should be able to say whatever she wants at her wedding without grief.", "Its relevant to her obviously and you don't get to decide what is relevant to a person at their wedding. No one does. I would have let my wife talk about anything that was important to her at our wedding.\n\nEveryone is missing the point. She is not talking about other people she is atrracted to. She is talking about herself.", "Yeah like if the speech was about coming to terms with her identity within the context of your relationship that's one thing but a speech about her other relationships and attraction to other people including men is kinda weird. Signed- a bi. \n\n(My phone wanted to correct \"bi\" to \"ho\" and that's a mood, lol!)", "All she has to say is something like \"When I struggled with my sexuality, OP stood by my side and supported me when I came out as bi.\" That's the only part relevant to your relationship, otherwise her dating men before you doesn't really have much to do with your wedding. It sounds like she's afraid that her bisexuality is going to be invalidated due to her marrying a woman, but that's a problem she needs to deal with by herself, not during your wedding.", "Those are reasons to make that speech at some other event, NOT at your wedding. As the fianc\u00e9, it would make me uncomfortable at the wedding.", "Maybe she just needs to tweak it.", "As a straight dude, I would be not happy about that. It should be about you two and your story. It does seem odd. Hope you get it solved and have a wonderful and happy marriage. Be kind and try to understand her reasons, marrying can be a very emotional event for some people and she might be dealing with some personal issues that she wants to say and that might have got in the speech. Communication is key. Also be assertive about you and how you would like to feel, if the speech is not ok, say so and be faithful to your heart.", "In my experience, that's literally what distinguishes bisexuality from heterosexuality and homosexuality.\n\nNone of which are necessary speech topics at a wedding.", ".... It THEIR wedding. This rightfully bothers and makes OP uncomfortable. You are a dumbass", "Not if it hurts or upsets her partner (and rightly so)...\n\nit isn't HER wedding, it is her AND op's wedding, which is I presume, why she showed her speech to OP.\n\nYes, she can say whatever she wants...  but she can't do it free of \"grief\" if the grief is her partner being hurt.  Consequences don't just disappear because it's your wedding day.", "Yes, give it a few reads out loud and check how it feels.", "So she should deny her soon to be wife what she wants to do at their wedding. If you believe that your the dumbass.", "If OP denies her saying what she wants that will cause her partner grief"]}
