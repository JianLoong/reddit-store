Talking about being bi is fine though, if like you said, it was solely about her coming to terms with her identity - that's great! But, to make a speech about her attraction to men while she gets married to a woman is...a choice.", "NTA.

She is marrying a woman not a man. I can see why you are frustrated with the thought of that and no, you aren't being selfish or biphobic.", "NTA that is a odd topic during her wedding to another woman. Her sexual awakening is great, wedding guests don\u2019t need those details.", "nta. what the fuck. why does she specifically need to flag that she's still also attracted to men still even though she's intending to marry her wife at the *Wedding*? rubs me the wrong way, wish you luck.", "NTA and are y'all sure you are ready to get married because it doesn't sound like she has come to terms with her sexuality.", "NTA - There's nothing wrong with proudly discussing your past love interests and sexuality in general, however, there's a time & place...\nDuring a speech at your own wedding is in poor taste. \nThe wedding is about you and her. The focus is on you and her. Discussing past lovers in your speech at your wedding (regardless of their gender) is disrespectful to your partner. \nThe speech should focus on the partner you're marrying and your *future* together.", "Nta. Discussing her romantic/sexual attraction to others at your wedding is just tacky and inappropriate to the occassion.  No one wants or needs to hear that at a wedding. It's a speech more appropriate to a group support meeting or political event or pride event etc.\nWedding speeches if given should be a celebration of the couples love and commitment  not about one of the individual journeys of  sexual revelation and discovery. \nRegardless of the subject matter any speech should be made with respect to you. If one of the spouses is uncomfortable or unhappy with parts of the speech h it should not be included. Period.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding is not the place for her to announce this. There is absolutely nothing wrong with her being proud of who she is, but this is not the time nor the place to make such an announcement.", "NTA I agree with you, it is weird as she is marrying a woman and not a man. \nCan\u2019t she just talk about discovering being being bi, instead of going into depth about liking men too?\nAnd no this doesn\u2019t make me  biphobic!", "NTA. I would examine her motives for this, actually. The wedding is about the two of you, not her sexual history, FFS.", "NTA\nA speech about being attracted to people other than her spouse is a bad way to start the marriage.", "I am not sure about the speech. Totally depends on what she says. Her identity? Fine. \u201c I also like guys\u201d while committing to a woman? Sounds non respectful. \nSo., without text and tone of the speech it\u2019s hard to tell", "NtA. How relevant is it that she also likes men if she's marrying a woman. Or is the intention to eventually open up the relationship so she can further explore this aspect of her identity?", "NTA if the speech is actually all about her being attracted to men. If it's just a sentence or two in a speech about her life, that's a different story. I'm under the impression that a wedding speech by a bride is supposed to traditionally be about her AND the person she's marrying, with maybe a a small tangent on the people/experiences before. The \"I also find men attractive\" speech shouldn't be at a wedding unless there's a good reason everyone at the wedding needs to know?", "NTA\n\nI'm bi. Married to a man. But at the heart of it, it's nobodies business but mine and my partners. Why does she need to make a speech about her attraction to others on your wedding day? That day should be about the attraction between you two...and no one else. \n\nNot biphobic to not want your btb talking about hooking up with others on your day, that talk is for the drunk MOH speech.", "NTA that\u2019s really strange. I\u2019m bisexual and I\u2019m marrying a man and I would definitely not talk about being attracted to women at our wedding. That\u2019s the time to talk about me and my fianc\u00e9.", "This one is tough. It doesn't sound like you'd have any problem with her saying the same stuff to the same people in another context, but yeah, I get not wanting it at your wedding. I'm straight and I'd be making a stinky face if my wife started taking about ex boyfriends at our wedding. I'm going with NTA, bordering on NAH.", "NAH so long as you just like. Get her to run the speech by you and offer some constructive criticism as opposed to just shutting her down completely. If you do just shut her down completely then YWBTA", "You're leaving a lot out, OP, which really makes me suspect that YTA.  Her identity is important to her, and your post makes me think you're not actually that comfortable with her being bi.\n\nIt's often important for bi people to be seen as bi, not just assume straight or assumed gay. I'm a cis woman, my husband is a cis man, but he's bisexual.  Yes, his marriage is \"heterosexual\" but when people say things assuming he's straight, he is quick to correct them because that's not who he is.  She may have some anxiety that marrying a woman is going to lead to people assuming her orientation is different than who she is, and there's so much bi erasure that it's fair she wants to plant her flag.\n\nBTW buying her a bi flag is sweet, but that's not the be all and end all of celebrating who she is.\n\nFrankly, your insecurity here is weird.  She discovered she liked men and...decided to marry you anyway?  She could choose from another 50% of the population and still chose you.  That's a compliment, not an insult.  Let her tell her story and be proud of her.\n\nDOWNVOTE ME BIPHOBES", "YWBTA - Her being bisexual and attracted to men is a part of her and if you're marrying her, you should be ready to accept all of her. She should be free to speak about it....she's marrying YOU, so what does it matter if she talks about her journey to finding her truth? It's her truth, not yours, and she's entitled to share it. \n\nDo you want her to be in the closet? That seems kinda shitty.", "YTA its her wedding also and she should be able to speak about anything she wants and you deserve the same.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's clearly not what's happening here. OP is omitting pretty much anything about the speech aside from what she took away from it in a very general way.", "I'm bi. I'm married, but I don't run around telling people that I'm monogamously committed to a lady but I'm also super into dick.\n\nI guess I must be one of those self hating bisexuals we always hear about at weddings. /s", "I agree, but people can surprise you either way \ud83d\ude05 That's why I explained that based on the info provided, no, they're nta, but, it actually really depends on what the speech actually says. If op just flat out doesn't want her fiancee mentioning she's attracted to men at all, that's problematic. If it's the focus of the speech, that would confuse me too."]}
