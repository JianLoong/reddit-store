I was getting ready to do homework so it ended up spilling on my grandpa\u2019s laptop he let me borrow to work on an essay.

He said no need to get upset. I said I think I have a right to, the half-sister shouldn\u2019t be acting out like this any time things don\u2019t go her way. My dad then said she is just a little girl. I asked my dad if he seriously thinks that. He shook his head yes. I was so upset this is now my life I said then I hate living here.

You should probably tell him about it as well as the circumstances.  If not, to him you\u2019re the one who did this.  And you absolutely shouldn\u2019t let that fly.  Document these things and communicate with people outside.  You\u2019re not tattling, venting is ok, asking advice is ok.

I think you should ask your maternal grandparents if you can move in. Never stay in an abusive situation.

It\u2019s not her fault they raised her to think that was okay. \n\nThe bigger issue is your (step)parents. They need to acknowledge the position their daughter\u2019s behaviour has put you in, and make reparations accordingly.

That must be extremely difficult. \n\nIt also must be difficult to be in a new living situation with an untamed child. \n\nI do think you need to apologize to your father. You said what you said out of anger and likely greif. Things are different and that is upsetting. \n\nI think you can make a sincere apology and at the same time express how much this is difficult for you and that your younger sisters attitude and behavior are not things you are used to.

Yes you hurt your dad's feelings and you should apologize for that.   Enlist your grandparents if you can to have a conversation with your dad about adjustments he need to make now that his home has a new full time addition.  \n\nAnd your stepmom needs one of them to take her to task about the name calling.   We do not resort to name calling teenagers when the have outbursts.   As adults we chose our lives, we are not slaves and can leave any situation we deem too tough but you as a 16yo do not have that option so your stressor can be deeper without choices.

Trust me, I have one. She needs to be disciplined by your parents for misbehaving, so it doesn't get worse, but being whiny and wanting things are totally normal. In many aspects, she's still a toddler, and I'm sure you were just as spoiled.\n\nI'm so sorry for the loss of your mother and the new, confusing living situation. You should really be in grief counseling, and your parents should look into family counseling to help you acclimate. There are free options available, so maybe calmly talk to your dad and/or stepmom about those, if finances are a concern.", "YTA, but I totally get it. Your life has turned upside down, you're 16, and you blurted out something in the heat of the moment that might be a bit true, but hurt someone who loves you. Yeah, they might be spoiling your little half-sister, but then again, she **IS** 5, and 5-year-olds have very little impulse control. I'm hoping you are self-aware enough to know that sometimes 16-year-olds do, too. You owe your dad an apology, and a sincere one at that. Then you can try to sit down with him and tell him how difficult it's been for you since your mom died and see if you can't make this right.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know I personally would hate living in that situation with a feral child who is being allowed to break things because she is a cute little girl. I think explaining to the father that allowing his child to break stuff and throw temper tantrums makes OP not want to be in the house. You have to be real in situations like this or you have absolutely no hope of fixing it.\n\n I would say simply, \"Dad I love you, however, I have just lost my mother and am now being forced to be OK with my things being broken. This is a situation I do not feel comfortable or safe in. I'm sorry if my being open about my comfort level hurt you but you need to understand that I'm hurting and she is making it worse, and you are allowing it. I'm glad you have a family that makes you happy, but it isn't a good feeling to be walking on eggshells around a 5-year-old for fear she will break something irreplaceable of mine. I would be happy to sit down and discuss how to achieve harmony in this house but not at the expense of my mental health.\"\n\nOP'S father is failing them, both children, horribly and saying sorry I hurt your fee fees dad isn't going to fix it. OP needs to be real while not antagonistic, and open their father's eyes to how his child is being allowed to be hurtful and spiteful. Heck during the conversation about harmony I would ask hard questions like how this attitude will manifest once she is an adult. Ask how they think they are setting her up for success when we all know the world has very harsh realities for grown people who act as this child has been allowed to.", "your 5 year old thinks it's ok to just spill drinks and food during her tantrums?

Dear God.\n\nNo, 5 year olds whine and beg and want attention.

It's on the parents to fix that behavior. OP's parents failed on that front here, but that doesn't make the kid bad, nor does it make her spoiled.\n\nI understand that you may not be a parent, but I promise you, this is NORMAL BEHAVIOR for a child. Regardless of my own parenting skills, I was also a teacher for children aged 1-5 for several years, and guess what, 5 year olds still throw fits, want attention, get jealous, and whiny. That was the point of my comment, and I have nothing further to say to you if you aren't capable of understanding that.  \n\n\nEdit: and, note, I also said that the parents should be disciplining the child, literally right after I mentioned that it's normal behavior.", "NAH. \n\nIt sounds like it\u2019s just a really difficult situation for you, of course you\u2019re going to bubble over from time to time.

See if you can schedule time for a 1-2-1 chat and see if you can clear the air. \n\nYour sister - she sounds hard work, but at 5 kids are all AHs. She\u2019s been used to having the place to herself and now she\u2019s got a full time sister, so that\u2019s a big adjustment. She needs boundaries and discipline, but ultimately her behaviour is to be expected.\n\nYour step-mum - the most AHish of you all, IMO.  I guess it depends if there\u2019s a pattern of her disregarding your feelings or if it was just a blip. Everyone has bad/stressful days and her family dynamic has shifted a fair bit lately too, so she might be feeling a bit of stress about that.
