Last year, the local historical society hosted an afternoon tea at one of the member\u2019s house, which is from the 1800s, and I attended and really enjoyed it. We were allowed to tour to house, which was what I really enjoyed. They\u2019d hired a catering service to make the tea and food that went along with it - finger sandwiches, custard tarts, etc. My daughter expressed interest in seeing the house and attending the tea with me, and this year it happened to fall on when she was home on break.\n\nI asked her if she still wanted to go and she said yes. She is a very picky eater, always has been, despite my best efforts, so I warned her that they might not serve anything she wanted to eat at the tea. She said that was okay and she\u2019d eat something before we left, which she did. We got to the house and did the tour\u2014she absolutely loved it and took a genuine interest in hearing about the restoration efforts and the history of the house. When it came time for tea, she politely refused any tea that was offered and simply drank her water. She took a few bites of one of the sandwiches but it wasn\u2019t to her taste so she simply set it down.\n\nShe was incredibly polite and didn\u2019t raise a fuss over the food at all. She complimented the caterers on their hard work and held conversation with the other women at the table. When the lunch was over, she excused herself to go to the bathroom, and one of the  women sitting nearby (60sF, part of the historical society committee) said it was rude of me to invite my daughter and her not eat anything. Another woman agreed and asked why I even brought her to the tea if she wasn\u2019t going to drink any. I explained that she had wanted to see the house and it was a way for us to spend time together, but now I\u2019m wondering if I had been wrong to bring her.\n\nI am not upset with my daughter at all, I am just wondering if I should have found something else to do with her while she was home instead that wouldn\u2019t have upset so many people.", "created_utc": 1694990382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16leh04/aita_for_letting_my_daughter_come_to_a_tea_where/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your daughter displayed genuine interest and appreciation during the tour. If people are upset with her it's because they are choosing to be not because her behavior was objectionable.", "NTA. Those people who complained are being ridiculous. No one is even required to eat to make others feel comfortable. Your daughter obviously enjoyed the event and social time and they could see that if they weren't so focused on the actual food/drink.", "You are absolutely not TA. Unless it was clearly stated in the invitation/announcement/whatever that every attendee was required to drink tea, you did absolutely nothing wrong. I think you wisely chose to enjoy together time with your daughter,", "NTA in respect to your daughter but why are you associating with a bunch of querulous judgemental jerks? I actually got annoyed reading their comments. What a bunch of ignorant AHs they are. \n\nYour daughter is a gem. Spend more time with her and less with those other... sorry can only think of obscenities to describe them.", "NTA\nAre they seriously watching who is eating/drinking and how much?", "NTA. Some people just want an excuse to be outraged. If anything, the breach of etiquette is on them. How dare they talk about your daughter behind her back and make insinuations at you in public before the lunch is even over? There could be any number of reasons your daughter was not eating or drinking, and it is the host's responsibility to make her comfortable and welcome regardless, and a good guest would not make the host's job harder by being insulting to another guest.", "NTA. Those ladies were critical busy bodies.", "absolutely not. That\u2019s such a fun idea.", "NTA, but those women were incredibly rude and judgemental. Please ignore them as their opinions aren't worth anything.", "You daughter did nothing wrong. Sounds like you raised a very sweet, endearing , kind and polite daughter. She behaved exactly how she should have in this situation. \n\nThe ladies bringing attention to the situation lacked class and grace.", "those women are awful. i think you and your daughter both acted with grace.", "NAH. You invited her, she attended and was polite. Other attendees having an issue with it doesn't mean you have to have an issue with it. Your daughter seemed to enjoy herself, therefore binding activity accomplished. I don't see the issue.", "Info: did your daughter\u2019s participation mean that another person didn\u2019t get to join a limited event?\n\nThe only tea I\u2019ve ever attended was a 3-hour sit down event where the tasting of foods and teas was the whole point. It would be like going to a paint-your-own-pottery event and not painting anything, or joining a knitting circle and never knitting anything. I generally agree that a person shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to eat or drink when they don\u2019t want to, however, I can also see that it would seem rude if someone bought a ticket to an event just to sit around and chat without participating in the design of the event, especially if it was sold out and others who actually wanted to participate were not able to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
