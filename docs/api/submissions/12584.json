Don't you think it would make more sense to ask (whomever might have the answer)?\"    \n\nBut at this point, I would not give an answer beyond \"Dunno\" and then everything after that would be questions.", "And then publish the wild tales!", "Well why don't you know about their life!?", "Definitely feel your rage on this one. It\u2019s SO annoying! Just\u2026why? Why do they think we know every detail of the life story of every random person we meet? Just because they would ask a thousand intrusive questions doesn\u2019t mean we would!", "It's more plausible to the mother that the car was stolen and packed with dead animals than that get child would not think to ask this person what they did with their old car.", "Yeah, it's shitty to take advantage of Mom's naivete, but when people are treating you like a slot machine where if they press the same button enough times a different answer will come out instead of listening to you like a human being, it's understandable to go a little haywire.", "I can see this, and it helps explain it a bit. It\u2019s still just so goddamn annoying.", "Yes, but . . . \n\nEveryone knows squirrel meat and elk meat taste horrible together.\n\nNTA. Funny as this situation is, this method is not sustainable in the long run. Maybe, if you think the reason for your mom's behavior is that she is nosy, redirect your mom to fb so she can stalk people and look for answers there? If you think she does this because she just isn't very smart, just be kind and after you say \"I don't know\", when she asks again, answer with \"Still don't know, mom\" over and over again.", "Honestly, where I\u2019m from, that would be normal and no one would bat an eye!", "Same, except my Dad does one of two things when I am forced to reiterate that I don't know for the 4th time and please stop asking depending on his mood: He either gets really mad at me like I'm some kind of asshole deliberately withholding information, or he acts like a wounded animal that never did anything wrong in his whole life and why am I being so mean to him. \n\nHonestly I desperately want to know the reason behind this behavior because it gets to a point where it feels pathological.", "Might be more productive to ask \"why do you think I'd know?\" And ask it genuinely, not rhetorically. Actually get her to explain her thinking and listen to it.", "From personal experience, that won't stop these people. I don't know what's going on in their minds but they will steamroll right over that shit and ask 3 more times.", "I've noticed that my in laws expect me to be aware of all kinds of information about people I know. 'Who's your cousin two states over dating?' 'What kind of car does your friend from college drive?' Things like that. To some people, these kinds of information are important to keep track of, and I must be deficient if I don't know about them. Maybe OP's mom is expecting OP to be in touch with these acquaintances enough to know what they did with their old car?", "What part of this is taking advantage? All it is is getting Mom off their back for stupid shit", "The squirrels don\u2019t care who did the killin\u2019, they just know who had the bodies.\n\nThey pay for blood with blood.", "Usually because im not fucking them.", "I'm half convinced we're going to find out that Mike the mechanic is secretly a demigod given his incredible ability to keep the beetle running.", "I love how that Black Vernacular turn of phrase (\u201cdo be\u201d) has entered the mainstream.", "This reminds me of my late grandma. When the news anchor ended the lunch news with something like \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow at the same time in your living room\u201d. She was perplexed by who was gonna let him in, she was adamant she was not opening the door to let a stranger in. \n\nMiss her", "That's it. I'm 30. My mom still asks me how certain college friends are doing. I haven't talked to them in 8 years. I think it's her way of trying to encourage me to reach back out to these people and rekindle friendships instead of just going to work, coming home, and sleeping every single day.\n\nIt's also a difference in how convos go now a days. I did reach out to a friend recently. Asked her how work was going and what shows or video games she is into now a days. I was talking to my mom and she asked me how her brothers wedding went. I stared at her like idk I didn't ask about her brother and sisters lives when I was catching up with hers.", "My in-laws are like this too. It\u2019s so frustrating. I don\u2019t fucking know every detail about other people\u2019s lives! They always know what everyone else is doing, but that\u2019s because they\u2019re nosy AF and every conversation with them is an interrogation. Then my MIL shares the details with everyone they know. \n\nAnd then they wonder why I\u2019m closed off and don\u2019t tell them anything.", "My mom is like that too! Why didn\u2019t your friend didn\u2019t have any children? I don\u2019t know mom! It\u2019s rude to ask that kind of questions! But they did ask that kind of questions and so she doesn\u2019t understand why I wouldn\u2019t want to.", "Well of course, but that doesn't explain the compulsive asking all within the same conversation. It is very hard to deal with someone that's treating you like a slot machine where if they press the same button enough times they'll get a different result.", "Yeah, and even more strange that she believes the weird lie over the one that makes sense. And the fact that she remembered to bring it up is crazy.", "You don't need to be sleeping with someone to ask what they're up to this weekend or why they dyed their hair.", "Huh, I still don\u2019t remember a hearse. Guess I also need a re-read!"]}
