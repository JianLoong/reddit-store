Tell me!\" He grew out of it.", "Omg, do I have a sibling I've never met?", "Depends on where you live.", "Nope, sorry, that wouldn't even be slightly odd in a lot of places.", "If she wants to have a conversation with OP, then how about asking questions about OP's life? You know, questions that OP knows the answer to?", "Nobody is taking advantage. She asked and got an answer she didn't like, so she asked again and again and again until she got an incorrect answer. That's 100% on her for not taking \"I don't know\" for an answer despite it being the true answer.", "Yes that's when she raises the real issue that's been on her mind, and if you are in a hurry to leave you're the asshole.", "Real", "I read a few of Butcher's Alera books, but eventually got bored with them. I keep wondering about giving the Dresden Files a shot, but I remember reading at least one more Alera book than I should have (and eventually just giving up on it).", "Or \u2026 could it be that she\u2019s in the early mild stages of dementia?

He also creepily describes the boobs and piercings of his friend's underage daughter quite a bit. If you're into the vibe but want to avoid the awful writing, check out the Rivers of London or Greywalker series.", "You should absolutely read The Dresden files. They're not quite as dramatic well that's not true. They're not quite as epic as the Codex Alera (at first), and fairlt light reading. Only a few hundred pages per book.", "The first couple of Dresden Files are the roughest to get through, IMO. And holy condescending wizards, Batman! Harry is a patronizing @#&$ in the few few, and he does get better. ...Sort of. \n\n(I mostly wanted to hit him with a clue bat, he was so obnoxious. But hey, I was sick with bronchitis and needed SOMETHING to take my mind off of it.) \n\nMaybe borrow them from your library? If your library is like mine they go the paperbacks like crazy (less stealing, more that they're easy/fast enough to read they get checked out a LOT), so if they got something like Libby that might work?", "Harry Dresden as a character is one of my faves. You absolutely should give it a go! Completely different than his Alera books. A modern day wizard in Chicago that wears a cool trench coat and  a talking skull as a partner. It\u2019s witty, bad ass, violent and fun. The first book is a short, it gets better, meatier.", "lotr\n\nthat poor little guy nearly died to protect us from the evil lava wizard......03 sure was a wild year who would have thought theres an evil lava wizard in new zealand!", "So true. Talking to my MIL is like being on a job interview.", "There are lots of different answers to the question that are true, and probably what mom's fishing for.

This is described in detail.!<", "Big thumbs up to Rivers of London.", "I'm so going to check out those series! Thanks for recommending them to the internet at large. I love(d?) the Dresden files but the sexism is getting out of hand, and the author is a douchey neck beard NiceGuy(TM).", "Upvoting for Greywalker series! I haven't read Dresden yet, but would also like to throw October Daye and Mercy Thompson recommendations into the mix", "Well, to be fair, it\u2019s a little hard not to describe when 1) it\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve seen her in a few years and 2) when she decides to get naked in an attempt to have sex with a person she considers a personal hero.", "i always thought that was just what wizards were like in that setting at least the white council ones but i only just read the first book yesterday", "Ugh, gross. It's been a long time since I've read them so it's very possible I just forgot about the continued sleaze.", "No problem! I found the Greywalker series through a Reddit rec but hadn't really heard of it anywhere else. It also has a noir feeling with vampires and other things that go bump in the night, but the main character is a female private detective who takes no shit. \n\nRivers of London is just a really well done series of paranormal police procedurals, but that's giving it short shrift. The world-building is excellent, the characters are unique and well-developed, and there are several plot lines that build across multiple books. I do always tell folks to push through the second book - it's good, but kind of a non-sequitur from the first. I think the author was making up his mind about whether he wanted to go for multiple books. It really feels like a series starting with the third book.", "In addition to the *Rivers of London* series, I'd add Mark Hayden's *King's Watch* books for British occult policing.", "I feel like it's really easy to not describe the boobily boobs in horny detail, especially if they belong to someone your character has known since they were a baby? \"Molly leapt around the corner and flung her naked body at Dresden. Horrified, he backed away.\" \n\nYou don't need to be like \"it was horrifying, but also her boobs were soooo booby, and her piercings glistened, but really I found it horrifying I promise\"", "You realise \"she\" doesn't exist and the writer made the decision to have her do those things right? Writing a teenage girl with a crush on her mentor and said mentor basically feeling the same but keeping back because of age is some barely conceived fantasising/kink.", "It might be? I think it's got something to do with their lifespans (like, they can live for centuries, though I don't recall how many- but at least 4 centuries and it's implied more), and if you live that long you get ALL the trauma. And the person who was your enemy yesterday is your ally today will be your enemy tomorrow might be the one to get your butt outta trouble later... So things can be complicated there. And you do fins you find out more about Harry's trauma in Summer Knight, Blood Right and Ghost Story, but I still wanted to bop him sometimes. \n\n(Well, at least from what I remember; it's been a few years since I read most of them. Gotta do a reread soon.)", "I just listened to the first Rivers of London book and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The narrator was excellent and delivered those Very British Humor lines so perfectly that sometimes the laughter just choked out of me.\n\nI have to use a credit pretty soon, so thanks for the reminder.", "They sounds great! I'm excited to check them out!", "No-o-o, that's not quite right. Dresden's not attracted to her. What fan fiction are you trying to write? He's had his heart messed up continuously, and only sees Molly as the little girl of his best friend.", "He got the Munstermobile after Mab sent him to go kill a certain someone in Cold Days I think it was."]}
