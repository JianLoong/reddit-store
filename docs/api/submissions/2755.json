NTA NTA NTA\n\nIf anyone has ruined anything its your parents....again wtf?!\n\nAlso I'm the mother of a 15 year old and a 13 year old. Wtf is wrong with your parents", "I'd interrupt her gab fest and say out loud: *You changed everything because grandma spoiled your mood mom. I get you feel upset. But, I'm not the dog that bit you. Grandma is. Why kick me or complain about me like I'm the one who started the bad mood party? I just witnessed it and became the aftermath. I'm sorry you were upset. But when I get hurt, I don't blame you. Surely you can see that part?*\n\nOr something to that effect. NTA. And I'd do it while she's on the phone because she can't defend herself to you or her friend if you approach her calmly and reasonably and *sweetly.* Don't let her wriggle out of the net.\n\nSpite fences suck. But, she's already invested in it going up. Time to bring it down.\n\nRemember to be pleasing in tone and manner and sweet when you approach her. If nothing else it will be entertainment for you. Good luck.\ud83d\ude09", "NTA.  This outburst from parents probably isn't the first time they've thanked you with anger.   Parents are TAs.", "NTA \n\nSounds like the tension was already high after the phone call and then your mom and dad used you as an emotional scape goat. Maybe grandma made them feel like they ruined Christmas so they subconsciously tried to pass it on like a curse lol", "NTA. My mother is just like this. Whenever she is jn a bad mood with her own family (usually her brother) she takes it out by being incredibly vile to me. Horrible comments about my character and how I'm the problem when I know I've done nothing wrong. Dad always defends her, leaving me always wondering what I did wrong and what moment caused a problem. \n\nI'm nearly 40 years old now and I've realised that it's nothing I've done and I can analyse my behaviour all I want, but my actions were irrelevant. So it isn't your fault at all. I've moved out a long time ago and I use time outs on my mother when she behaves like this - I'll go no contact until she apologises and then low contact until I'm ready to resume the earlier relationship. The end result - she doesn't pull that crap anymore.", "NTA\n\nIt is wrong of them to take whatever happened with granny out on you.", "Oh look, a chain of screaming. They get crap from your gran, they pass that down to you. I guess you're supposed to scream at your sister or kick a puppy now. Good for you for opting out of that nonsense. \n\nNTA - This is all a them issue. You're not a brat, you didn't ruin Christmas, and there's nothing wrong with having \"an answer for everything.\" Especially when you're trying to stop your own parents from using you like an emotional support pi\u00f1ata.", "NTA\n\nWonder where your parents get it from.", "Nah, sounds like granny ruined that shit.", "NTA.  Did you set fire to the tree?  Did you walk into the mall and tell every kid waiting in line for Santa that he was just a trucker?  Because actually ruining Christmas is a pretty difficult activity, certainly one that doesn't start with someone wanting to watch someone else put up decorations.  Even if your account is even somewhat accurate what actually happened was that your parents were already in a bad mood and you not doing exactly what they wanted was the straw that broke the camel's back.  It was just redirection from emotionally unintelligent people.  You are not a brat, you are not in the wrong, and you're doing just fine.", "NTA.\n\nYou had a lovely day with your family, worked hard and made the house nice for the holidays.\n\nYou didn\u2019t ruin anything by resting and not putting an ornament on a tree.\n\nYour mom is taking whatever her unrelated frustrations are out on you.", "NTA I get that your parents were pissed off because of the phone call, but I can't Imagine taking a huge tone with my child and telling them maliciously that they'd \"ruined Christmas\" just because she let her younger sister, in the crime of the century, put christmas ornaments on the tree while she watched. \n\nYour parents sound really immature. They remind me of my alcoholic, pill-popping verbally abusive,  sister-in-law.\n\nShould ask them for an apology, tell them you don't deserve them insulting you and your sister wasn't doing anything wrong.", "NTA.
