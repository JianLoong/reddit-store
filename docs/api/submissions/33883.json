We used to belong to a family of 5, but sadly our mother passed away from cancer earlier this year. It has been tough for all of us, but has been specially hard on my younger brother who is currently in college. He failed 2 semesters in a row this year due to difficulty coping with this situation and is on the verge of being suspended.\n\nOnly 2.5 months after my mothers death, my father informed my sister and I that he had already found a new girlfriend and was in a serious relationship. My sister and I were shocked and disappointed. Finding a new partner after only 2.5 months seemed rushed and offensive.\n\nMy sister and I explained to him that while we were willing to accept him moving on to someone else, we were however not interested in being involved with this new woman in any way. It was just too soon. We also made it very clear to him that he needed to hide this situation from our brother who was struggling to pass his classes. This was his last chance and if he were to fail the semester again due to difficulty coping with the situation, he would be suspended for a year.\n\nOur father claimed to understand our concerns and apologized for any added stress this put on us. He also claimed to fully agree about hiding the situation from my brother for now. I hoped at this point that the situation was under control. Sadly it was only about to get much worse.\n\nAround a week before thanksgiving, my brother was flying home from school for the holidays. At his school they get around 10 days off before they have to fly back to take their final exams (school is on quarter system). My sister and I expected our dad to stay home to spend time with our brother. After all, this was the first major family holiday since our mothers passing and we assumed our dad would want to make sure our brother was ok and ready for exams. We were mistaken.\n\nThe morning after my brother arrived home, not only had our father decided to tell my brother everything about his new girlfriend, but he also just left the house to travel to a different state to spend the holidays with her. Not only did he show blatant disregard for my brothers situation but also showed no interest in spending the first major family holiday since his wife's passing with his kids. \n\nOn thanksgiving he didn't even text or call me or my siblings to ask what we were doing. My siblings and I were furious with him over this behavior and we had a huge fight. He basically tried to gaslight us, claimed that we were overreacting and that we didn't care about his life. He also acted very entitled demanding we \"get on board\" with his new relationship. He then casually dropped the bombshell that he planned to marry this woman next year. \n\nGiven his blatant disregard for my brothers wellbeing and overall distasteful behavior, I've decided I won't be going to his wedding and I basically don't speak with him at all beyond replying yes or no the rare times he does message me.

I'm so sorry for your loss. Truly. And you obviously can't hold back this tide. But, I don't blame you for not wanting to celebrate his new life. Can your father not bear to be alone? Is that what's driving him now?", "NTA, it sounds like your dads shown you where his priorities lie. \n\nHe\u2019s entitled to move on but he has been pretty inconsiderate of you and your siblings feelings. The first holiday post a close family member passing is tough and I can\u2019t imagine leaving my kids alone to go shack up with someone on the first holidays if my husband had recently passed. Why is he in such a hurry? I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Just focus on supporting your brother and encourage him to get help. I took time off study after my brother passed because it just got to be way too much and even when I went back I needed a lot of support and therapy to struggle through and finish my degree", "NTA. At all. Get your brother in therapy and celebrate holidays with your siblings.", "NTA. I'm so sorry. I bet you feel like you have no parent now.\nTry to focus on your siblings and yourself. Meet up as much as possible to support each other. I agree with an earlier poster about getting all family heirlooms and mementos out of your dad's house asap. What a sorry excuse for a husband and father...", "This shit is hard.  It really is.  Your dad is an adult  just as you kids are.\n\nDad has every right to do whatever feels right for him.  Should he take into account that his children are grieving after 2.5 months and that he's being disrespectful to their mother, his marriage, his wife.  Yes he should, but it is his decision.  Just as it's you and you siblings de ision to get on-board with the relationship, or not!\n\nAll you can do is give it time and take care of yourselves, you 3 make sure you have plans for Thanksgiving  birthdays.  He can be involved or not.  Don't close the door on him, but try to move forward and heal, he actually doesn't need to be involved for that to happen.\n\nTake care, focus on yourselves (you and your siblings)  love each other and be kind \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. At all.", "NAH. You are all grieving in different ways. I get that you are all upset and rightly so. But your father's timeline to start dating may not be yours. Your brother needs more help than he is getting. It is sad that his parent does not currently seem to have the ability to help him. It may be good to see if he can defer his next semester at school to work on his grief and coping. I would suggest you all get into some Lind of grief counselling as individuals and as a family.  If your dad won't go, at least you and your siblings can. You don't have to attend your dads wedding if you don't want to. But please also give him some grace. He has lost his wife, whom he was married to for over 2 decades.", "NTA.  You're all grieving in your own way.  Your father discovered he couldn't handle life alone and he's trying to fill that void so he doesn't have to feel that way again.  Your brother needs some professional help.  Not because there's something \"wrong\" with him, but because he needs some coping mechanics to help him manage his stressors.  As for you, getting together with your remaining family to lean on each other during a tough time was what you needed.  You're hurt because your dad prioritized his own pain over yours.  I think y'all need some grief counseling.  Find a therapist, join a group, go together or alone, but you're whole family needs some assistance in handling your grief.  And THAT'S OK.  We don't know how we'll react to losing a parent until it happens, so there's nothing to be ashamed of.", "How did your brother do on his finals after Thanksgiving?  I hope he passed.", "NTA. It is completely understandable that you prioritize your emotional well-being and set boundaries in light of your father's apparent lack of concern for your brother's welfare and his callous behavior after your mother's passing. By choosing to limit contact and declining participation in the wedding, you are effectively expressing your deep upset and potentially preserving any chance of a future relationship with him.", "NTA. I'm so sorry about your mother. Devastating. It's great that you are able to look out for your brother and sister in your shared grief. For your own piece of mind, you must accept that you cannot affect your father's reaction. He has chosen his own path and is in a different zone from you three, who are understandably still in the rawest stage of grief. You will have to support each other and let him pursue his own course. Of course, you're angry and disillusioned with him, your whole world has fractured and he's opted out but confrontation will probably just cause you all even more pain.", "Definitely NTA. Your father's definitely a big one.", "YTA for replying to his messages. STOP ENABLING HIM!!! Take a stand. Have some guts. Cut off the rotten person from your life. Dont take half-measures.", "YTA. Borderline. \n\nPeople deal with grief in different ways. Some people retreat into a shell. Some people go on ill-advised rampages of drugs and alcohol. Others carry on like normal.\n\nI note that not once have you stated your dad's feelings regarding your mum's passing save for a general remark that 'its been tough for all of us'. Or maybe you didn't intend to reference your dad in that remark at all.\n\nYou don't mention what your dad is doing, whether he's still working or retired, whether he has a business, whether he's active in the community, etc. \n\nIn light of that lack of information, I find your expectation that your dad should be the designated person to stay home and provide support to your younger brother to be entitled. Why can't you or your sister be the ones providing support instead? It is a family unit after all. \n\nMaybe, just maybe, your dad is cracking under the pressure of being the 'strong' one and just wants to get away from it all. Maybe, he's running away with his new gf as a form of escapism. \n\nHave you considered that?", "He was probably cheating on your mom before she passed", "Your dad is still the same person he was when your mom was alive, it\u2019s just obvious now how unimportant he was compared to her.

A bread truck pulled out in front of him, he didn't have enough time to stop, and died instantly on impact. The man wasn't even gone 3 months and his mother was already in relationship, and married the dude with in 6 months. Turns out she was having an affair for the past year, and her husband's death made it easy for her. It didn't last for her. New guy was abusive, and she ended up divorcing him. She never knew how lucky she really was. She had married her high school sweetheart, and he worshiped the ground she walked on. He truly loved her, and supported her in every way possible. I still feel so bad for that man til this day. \n\n\nI'm not saying your dad was having an affair. But, 2.5 months isn't even enough time to grieve the loss of a loved one like that unless they've already moved.", "NTA.\n\nWhile some people do move on fast, this disregard for your brother's grief is quite frankly, monster behaviour from a parent.\n\nIt might be how he is processing his grief - running off into a rebound relationship, running from the pain into a temporary bliss at full speed. But it won't heal him and it will likely destroy this relationship pretty fast if that is what he is doing, while also destroying your relationships with him.\n\nYou would likely be best distancing from him for a good while and see how you feel about things when his relationship has finished blowing up. Which it likely will when he can't find what he wants in this woman. He isn't going to find the relationship he had with your mum in her or the healing he needs. And she likely isn't interested in carrying the weight of his baggage.\n\nIt is up to you and your siblings if this is something you will be able to forgive him for with time and distance, or if you're too appalled to ever want to speak to him again.", "I hate to tell you this, but your dad has 100% known this woman and intended to date her (if he has not already been dating her) for a lot longer than 2 months.

Maybe grief counseling for everyone isn't a bad call.\n\nInfo - was it known to be terminal? How long was she given and how ill was she? Was your father her main carer?\n\n\nYou probably aren't privy to the intimate details they discussed before her passing. She may have encouraged him to find someone. Pure speculation would be if he was already involved prior to her passing. \n\nSome people aren't capable of being alone. Every one processes grief differently, judging or assuming anything isn't a good idea. Hiding things never works, no matter how well intentioned and always ends up worse. \n\nNTA, a gentle ESH.

It felt quick to me, but when I asked my husband how he felt about it, he said he was fine with it and that he just wanted his Dad to be happy. FYI, my FIL just turned 90 two weeks ago, and they've been married 20 years. I'm not going to label you TA or NTA here because how you feel is just how you feel. I just wanted to offer another view of the situation.

It doesn't matter how old you are, losing a parent will fuck you up. Your dad has made his choice. I think a better focus for that energy is making sure your brother is taken care of and getting the help and support he needs.", "NTA\n\nOP, what happened over the holidays?  And did your brother pass?  Has he accessed counseling (both academic and therapeutic) through his school yet?", "NTA.\n\nidk if it\u2019s just me, but everytime i see a story about one parent dying and the other moving on so fast, i feel like they have been cheating. why is it that your dad has found someone only 2.5 months after? has he been with her while with your mother? also i\u2019m not sure if you can, but please get you and your siblings to go NC or LC because the father clearly doesn\u2019t care about you guys.", "EHS. But possibly NAH. \n\nDid your parents have a good relationship? Did your dad lose a wife long before your mom died? Emotionally, physically, and sentimentally your dad probably lost his wife a long time ago due to the cancer. He possibly turned into her caregiver and wasn\u2019t cared for by her (not her fault just probably true). They probably didn\u2019t have intimacy for a while too. Although it may seem like less than a year is short, it may have been years since he\u2019s been heard or felt. If their relationship wasn\u2019t great prior to the cancer, it\u2019s possible he stuck around until she died. Shorter version: your dad may have feelings and gone through something you don\u2019t understand. \n\nYour brother is 20. He\u2019s an adult. He should voluntarily take a leave from school. There are policies in place instead of trying to simply muscle through. Sure your dad can be more supportive but so can you guys towards him. His agreeing then not following through with hiding his new relationship isn\u2019t great, but he isn\u2019t obligated to hide it either. \n\nYou\u2019re grieving and may not accept your dad\u2019s new love interest, but you\u2019re also unsupportive of him as well.

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been a tremendously difficult time for all and will take much more time to heal.\n\nThe degree of your dad\u2019s AH-ness depends on how his new relationship developed. I mean if your dad\u2019s out on Tinder after the terminal diagnosis, that\u2019s super shitty. If it\u2019s someone he met through grief or support counseling where both partners bonded over loss, that\u2019s completely different - and you should cut him some slack if that\u2019s the case. Just to recap, your mother was terminal for 2+ years and off treatment for the last 6-7 months before her death. Not saying it\u2019s right, but the marriage may have felt over for those last 2+ years.

They don't have to be anything formal, I think the r/widowers group was actually decent if I recall, and they should read up on what other people are experiencing. Whether OP realizes it or not, a *lot* of people have already started dating at two months in. A lot of people also fall prey to scammers they think they're dating or various other people who are taking advantage of them at two to three months in (that happened to me and I certainly hadn't been *trying* to date, there are ways people consciously or unconsciously take advantage of new widows and widowers).\n\nAt the end of the day, it's completely understandable that OP and her siblings *don't* get why these things happen, I certainly wouldn't have after my mom died, but it certainly makes a lot more sense after having had to deal with losing my spouse.", "Actions definitely have consequences, and sometimes grief tears families apart.

He may never realize this, and I\u2019m sorry to say it. \n\nFocus on yourselves, as a family, get grief counselling individually, and together if you think it would be beneficial (could be especially due to your dad\u2019s behaviour). Ideally your father would do the same, though he may not believe he needs it since he is \u201cin a serious relationship\u201d which may be masking it for him. And if you don\u2019t want to, don\u2019t attend that wedding. Your dad is doing nothing to make it something you\u2019d want to attend anyway.", "Sounds like Dad only *said* he met her 10 weeks after the passing of your mother. \n\nNTA", "NTA, but I think you have to accept peoole grieve differently and there could be an element of learned helplessness. If you dad has had someone cook and care for him...he might not be coping without his wife and need someone to provide that support you can't blame him for moving on so quickly.\n\nThe thanksgiving thing sounds like miscommunication did anyone say you were planning a thanksgiving dinner? Did anyone ask dad what his plans were? \n\nBut i think you need to let your dad do his own thing and you siblings need to pull together. \n\nCan your brother look at stopping college for a while? I think rather than the pressure of failing can maybe the two of your talk to the college and say he's struggling since mum has died. Can we suspend his studies for a bit. Whilst we focus on his mental health. Can we go part time? Can we take a year off. Can he just do one class or something? I know america has a different system to the UK which i think sounds awesome but i don't know where you are. Get your brother a year out if you can just to work a bit and have some money and time. The most important thing to tell him is no one cares when you finish college/uni they only care about what you come out with. Go backpacking for a bit. Get a job for a bit. Sit on the couch and chill for a bit...but not too much go out and try and do positive things without the pressure for a bit.", "NTA this is a well known thing men do. As soon as their spouse is dead, sick, or injured, they jump ship as fast as possible to a new thing. There's many theories, but its more prevalent amongst men who treated their wives like servants. Did your parents split the house chores and the parenting or did your mom do it all while your dad was on the side lines? \n\nUnfortunately men like this would rather divorce themselves from their families to please their new partner.he is a pathetic coward so afraid of being alone and taking care of himself he would rather abandon his family. Let him. Go NC and let him go.", "NTA, I would agree with your decision to stay away from his relationship and his GF until you\u2019re properly ready. I would also suggest meeting with a counsellor alone and with your siblings. \n\nOne thing your brother may need to consider (whenever he\u2019s ready) that perhaps your father moving on was a decision supported by your mother. She knew she was dying, she knew she and your father didn\u2019t have the relationship as they did when she was healthy. Not saying his callousness is right. But (unless stated otherwise) your mom might have given him the go ahead to move on, so it\u2019s not disrespecting her. It seems that he is running away when he shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nThere have been situations where living parents replace the dead parent ASAP with someone else for convenience.

My dad was in his late 40\u2019s. \n\nMy parents were very happily married and it was hard on my dad-I know for a fact that he loved my mom and he would still be married to her if she were still here. But, that\u2019s not an option. \n\nAbout six months later, he asked permission to start dating again, even though I suspect he had already started. He explained that he was bored, lonely, and going crazy and while I didn\u2019t love it, I made the decision to be fine with it and think of it from his perspective-I gave him my blessing. However, I told him I wasn\u2019t interested in meeting anyone at this time. He agreed, and kept his girlfriends out of my view, and when I went to see him, it was only him-he held his end of the bargain until a couple of years later, he told me he\u2019d been with someone for awhile and they were thinking about moving in together. I agreed to meet her, and eventually gave my blessing to the relationship. They\u2019re married now. \n\nLooooong story short, she\u2019s not exactly my favorite person, but I tolerate her because she is good for my dad and it simply wasn\u2019t fair that I demand he be lonely and unhappy because I still miss my mom. The sad, hard fact is that our moms are gone, not coming back, and life is for the living. \n\nDid you acknowledge your dad\u2019s grief in any of this, or did you think of it only from your perspectives? Did your dad hint at things only for you guys to impose some Victorian standard of mourning on him and now he\u2019s on the defensive? \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s plenty ah-ish for not assisting with your brother\u2019s grief in an appropriate manner, but have you thought of how your dad is holding up in all this, or are you expecting him to be an automaton? \n\nYou aren\u2019t kids anymore, and as much as it sucks, the family you loved died and went with your mom, and it\u2019s not coming back. You need to process and accept this. I\u2019m sorry if this sounds rude, but I\u2019ve been in your position, and that\u2019s just the way it is. You don\u2019t have to love it, but you do have to accept it. Trust me, I know. \n\nSo, you guys are adults and should act as such. Imo, it would be highly beneficial if you told your dad that you realize he has needs and that you accept that, but while  you guys still need him, you\u2019re not ready to accept seeing him with another woman at this time. If he can\u2019t respect that, then it\u2019s time for family 2.0 and you create a new family holiday tradition. \n\nIt sucks, OP. I\u2019m sorry. You don\u2019t have to like it, but this is your new normal so the quicker you accept it, the quicker you can move forward. \n\nMy thoughts and best wishes with all of you.

My uncle described it as he started the grieving process 3 years earlier when they got the diagnosis of terminal cancer. So for him it wasn\u2019t sudden.", "This is something I have seen also. So many older men went from mom to wife, never lived alone. And have no idea how to even care for their own household needs.  Plus had wives who did all the emotional work, meeting their needs for emotional support and closeness and mediated their relationships with the children. They are so lost as widower that a new parter is a huge relief.\n\n I have more than one friend who had widowed fathers marry within a year to a woman they met at a grief support group.", "It\u2019s not just normal, it\u2019s statistically accurate. Men will take less time off work, and start dating quicker after a spouse dies, than women will. I used to work in insurance, and we did a lot of training on how to approach the topic (part of life insurance includes a calculation of debts, time needed off work, etc) with couples, because each spouse will have vastly different answers about how much time off (if any) they would take from work. \n\nI also experienced this, dad was dating again less than six months after my mom died. We supported his choice but didn\u2019t want to be overly involved at the time. It got\u2026 bad. I don\u2019t think he ever truly grieved, and it didn\u2019t help his dating life. Neither did the alcoholism.", "It\u2019s also incredibly common with a terminal illness like that for husbands to mourn the loss prior to the death itself (anticipatory grief), causing them to move on seemingly faster than is \u201cideal\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d (placing these in quotes because I don\u2019t actually believe there\u2019s a normal way to grieve; everyone is different).", "So yes, no evidence it happened here, you\u2019re just trying to make a bad situation between a grieving father and son even worse.", "That's all the more reason for him to prioritize his family and helping his children acclimate to this new normal, though? Instead, he's thinking with his dick.", "Using another person to get over his late wife dead is actually a bad thing. He needs therapy not fucking someone else with no regard of his kids feelings.", "This. I lost my dad in my 20s and it was absolutely AWFUL, but I always imagined that it was worse for my stepmom. After all, I was an adult no longer living at home, so while it was a terrible loss for me, it didn\u2019t affect my day-to-day life in the same way that it affected hers. Unfortunately, my stepmom ended up treating me pretty horribly back then, but I continued to try to make amends, and when she finally apologized years later, I chose to forgive her\u2014as I understood (or tried to understand) the depths of her grief at the time. \n\nAll that to say, I absolutely feel for the OP and his siblings. Losing my dad is the worst thing to ever happen to me (and I\u2019ve experienced a number of other traumatic things). But throughout his post and comments, OP never once expresses concern for how this has affected his dad and how it\u2019s *been* affecting his dad for years as he slowly watched his life partner die. And I just think that by the age of 27 he should be able to be a little more empathetic towards his father\u2019s plight. At roughly the same age, I was hyper-aware of and sensitive to how this would be affecting my stepmom, and she and I were never even that close. But I was the one reaching out to her, being proactive and asking about the holidays, asking her what she needed and how I could help. I can\u2019t even imagine cursing her out, actively judging her choices, and telling her that something she was doing was \u201chumiliating my dad\u201d and that \u201che was rolling over in his grave\u201d (even if that\u2019s how I felt at the time). \n\nI don\u2019t know. I tend to think that *all* people involved in this situation could stand to be more understanding and accommodating of each other.", "Dad's actions are telling his children that he's happy as a clam and cares nothing for his own family anymore. Why should his children even pretend to be fine with that?", "Some of yall are jaded AF", "You just gave me a whole new prospective on my friend\u2019s husband moving on after she died. They had 3 kids together and he was with her to the very end, telling her stories of how they met and how he fell in love with her. He remarried after a year and a half and I felt like he was trying to replace my friend, not just as a wife but as a mom. I couldn\u2019t understand how he could be so absolutely in love with her but find someone and remarry quicker than his relationship with my friend. I\u2019ve been trying to understand it and your one comment really helped. Thank you", "I think I\u2019ve actually read that the happier a man was in his marriage, the quicker he is likely to move on after his spouse\u2019s death. May seem paradoxical to the rest of us, but men are more likely than women to want to replicate that happiness and to do so quickly.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss. \u2764\ufe0f", "I\u2019m so very sorry for your losses and hope that you\u2019re doing okay today. \u2764\ufe0f", "Those are two huge losses so close to each other. There\u2019s no good way to lose our loved ones, but there\u2019s definitely bad ways. I lost my parents 4 years apart, but my mom was 1/3 and my dad was 1/19 and the dates being close pretty much ruined this time of year for me, I imagine something similar for you with it being the same year.\n\nI turned to a grief group to on Facebook (grief beyond belief, for anyone looking for a secular space to grieve), and I think the most important lesson I learned from the various discussions there was that you can\u2019t compare grief. Losing a spouse isn\u2019t like losing a parent, or a sibling, or a child, or a best friend. You can\u2019t even compare person A losing a spouse to person B losing a spouse. Grief is grief and it all sucks. The second most important lesson I learned was to be gentle with myself when I\u2019m grieving, and to try and be gentle with others when it comes to their grief.\n\nI hope you were able to weather the tension with your father, and I hope you\u2019ve gotten to a point where you have far more good days than bad.", ">and after appropriate time for grief\n\nNow this is just funny what exactly is an appropriate time for grieving?  When did all of humanity come together to set a specific timeframe for that?\n\nI get that it's easier to make the father the big bad in this story however op isn't privy to the inner workings of there parents relationship add in the fact that it was known that there mother was terminally ill for an extended period of time.\n\n>It\u2019s not about controlling his life \n\nThey quite literally are upset that a grown man decided that staying in a hostile environment with people who are actively and loudly criticising his activities wasn't conjunctive to his wellbeing. \n\n>grace he failed to show his kids who are obviously hurt after losing a very important figure in their lives. \n\nDoes this not extend both ways? Op discussed everyone's feelings except their fathers its easy to assume the worse. However real life is much more complicated than that op is obviously going to portray the situation from a biased point of view and isn't aware of many aspects of the situation or what's going though their fathers mind.", "I think you need to take a step back and look at things objectively. Have you sat down and asked your father how he's doing emotionally?\n\nYou've focused on your wellbeing, your siblings well being however not once have you spoke about your father's head space. It's honestly easier to jump on the bandwagon and say he's being callous, a shitty dad, dishonoring your mother ect ect.\n\n However the truth is going to be more complicated than that instead of assuming you guys need to sit down and talk about his feelings.\n\nMaybe seeing you guys is so painful a reminder its easier on him to check out of the situation.\n\nMaybe he's the clich\u00e9d caricature your story and many of the comments want to paint him as.\n\nMaybe he's being emotionally manipulated by his new partner.\n\nMaybe he simply needed a shoulder to cry on because he felt no support at home.\n\nReallife is messy and complicated many of the issues you mentioned could've been easily resolved by talking things out instead of letting them fester into resentment and anger. You obviously have zero idea of your father's heads pace of feelings.", "Your father sounds like a heartless, incredibly selfish man. I feel sorry for you and your siblings. \nNTA", "I'm so sorry that happened to you. That's...a lot", "Various faith traditions strongly encourage a formal period of mourning (generally a year) before making any major life decisions. I'm not religious myself, but I see the logic in these traditional expectations.", "Her dads apparently fine, he doesn\u2019t give a shit about his dead wife or living kids. I hope he finds his karma in this evil women he\u2019s with."]}
