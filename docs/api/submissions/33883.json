We used to belong to a family of 5, but sadly our mother passed away from cancer earlier this year. It has been tough for all of us, but has been specially hard on my younger brother who is currently in college. He failed 2 semesters in a row this year due to difficulty coping with this situation and is on the verge of being suspended.\n\nOnly 2.5 months after my mothers death, my father informed my sister and I that he had already found a new girlfriend and was in a serious relationship. My sister and I were shocked and disappointed. Finding a new partner after only 2.5 months seemed rushed and offensive.\n\nMy sister and I explained to him that while we were willing to accept him moving on to someone else, we were however not interested in being involved with this new woman in any way. It was just too soon. We also made it very clear to him that he needed to hide this situation from our brother who was struggling to pass his classes. This was his last chance and if he were to fail the semester again due to difficulty coping with the situation, he would be suspended for a year.\n\nOur father claimed to understand our concerns and apologized for any added stress this put on us. He also claimed to fully agree about hiding the situation from my brother for now. I hoped at this point that the situation was under control. Sadly it was only about to get much worse.\n\nAround a week before thanksgiving, my brother was flying home from school for the holidays. At his school they get around 10 days off before they have to fly back to take their final exams (school is on quarter system). My sister and I expected our dad to stay home to spend time with our brother. After all, this was the first major family holiday since our mothers passing and we assumed our dad would want to make sure our brother was ok and ready for exams. We were mistaken.\n\nThe morning after my brother arrived home, not only had our father decided to tell my brother everything about his new girlfriend, but he also just left the house to travel to a different state to spend the holidays with her. Not only did he show blatant disregard for my brothers situation but also showed no interest in spending the first major family holiday since his wife's passing with his kids. \n\nOn thanksgiving he didn't even text or call me or my siblings to ask what we were doing. My siblings and I were furious with him over this behavior and we had a huge fight. He basically tried to gaslight us, claimed that we were overreacting and that we didn't care about his life. He also acted very entitled demanding we \"get on board\" with his new relationship. He then casually dropped the bombshell that he planned to marry this woman next year. \n\nGiven his blatant disregard for my brothers wellbeing and overall distasteful behavior, I've decided I won't be going to his wedding and I basically don't speak with him at all beyond replying yes or no the rare times he does message me.

I'm so sorry for your loss. Truly. And you obviously can't hold back this tide. But, I don't blame you for not wanting to celebrate his new life. Can your father not bear to be alone? Is that what's driving him now?", "NTA, it sounds like your dads shown you where his priorities lie. \n\nHe\u2019s entitled to move on but he has been pretty inconsiderate of you and your siblings feelings. The first holiday post a close family member passing is tough and I can\u2019t imagine leaving my kids alone to go shack up with someone on the first holidays if my husband had recently passed. Why is he in such a hurry? I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Just focus on supporting your brother and encourage him to get help. I took time off study after my brother passed because it just got to be way too much and even when I went back I needed a lot of support and therapy to struggle through and finish my degree", "NTA. At all. Get your brother in therapy and celebrate holidays with your siblings.", "NTA. I'm so sorry. I bet you feel like you have no parent now.\nTry to focus on your siblings and yourself. Meet up as much as possible to support each other. I agree with an earlier poster about getting all family heirlooms and mementos out of your dad's house asap. What a sorry excuse for a husband and father...", "This shit is hard.  It really is.  Your dad is an adult  just as you kids are.\n\nDad has every right to do whatever feels right for him.  Should he take into account that his children are grieving after 2.5 months and that he's being disrespectful to their mother, his marriage, his wife.  Yes he should, but it is his decision.  Just as it's you and you siblings de ision to get on-board with the relationship, or not!\n\nAll you can do is give it time and take care of yourselves, you 3 make sure you have plans for Thanksgiving  birthdays.  He can be involved or not.  Don't close the door on him, but try to move forward and heal, he actually doesn't need to be involved for that to happen.\n\nTake care, focus on yourselves (you and your siblings)  love each other and be kind \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. At all.", "NAH. You are all grieving in different ways. I get that you are all upset and rightly so. But your father's timeline to start dating may not be yours. Your brother needs more help than he is getting. It is sad that his parent does not currently seem to have the ability to help him. It may be good to see if he can defer his next semester at school to work on his grief and coping. I would suggest you all get into some Lind of grief counselling as individuals and as a family.  If your dad won't go, at least you and your siblings can. You don't have to attend your dads wedding if you don't want to. But please also give him some grace. He has lost his wife, whom he was married to for over 2 decades.", "NTA.  You're all grieving in your own way.  Your father discovered he couldn't handle life alone and he's trying to fill that void so he doesn't have to feel that way again.  Your brother needs some professional help.  Not because there's something \"wrong\" with him, but because he needs some coping mechanics to help him manage his stressors.  As for you, getting together with your remaining family to lean on each other during a tough time was what you needed.  You're hurt because your dad prioritized his own pain over yours.  I think y'all need some grief counseling.  Find a therapist, join a group, go together or alone, but you're whole family needs some assistance in handling your grief.  And THAT'S OK.  We don't know how we'll react to losing a parent until it happens, so there's nothing to be ashamed of.", "How did your brother do on his finals after Thanksgiving?  I hope he passed.", "NTA. It is completely understandable that you prioritize your emotional well-being and set boundaries in light of your father's apparent lack of concern for your brother's welfare and his callous behavior after your mother's passing. By choosing to limit contact and declining participation in the wedding, you are effectively expressing your deep upset and potentially preserving any chance of a future relationship with him.", "NTA. I'm so sorry about your mother. Devastating. It's great that you are able to look out for your brother and sister in your shared grief. For your own piece of mind, you must accept that you cannot affect your father's reaction. He has chosen his own path and is in a different zone from you three, who are understandably still in the rawest stage of grief. You will have to support each other and let him pursue his own course. Of course, you're angry and disillusioned with him, your whole world has fractured and he's opted out but confrontation will probably just cause you all even more pain.", "Definitely NTA. Your father's definitely a big one.", "YTA for replying to his messages. STOP ENABLING HIM!!! Take a stand. Have some guts. Cut off the rotten person from your life. Dont take half-measures.", "YTA. Borderline. \n\nPeople deal with grief in different ways. Some people retreat into a shell. Some people go on ill-advised rampages of drugs and alcohol. Others carry on like normal.\n\nI note that not once have you stated your dad's feelings regarding your mum's passing save for a general remark that 'its been tough for all of us'. Or maybe you didn't intend to reference your dad in that remark at all.\n\nYou don't mention what your dad is doing, whether he's still working or retired, whether he has a business, whether he's active in the community, etc. \n\nIn light of that lack of information, I find your expectation that your dad should be the designated person to stay home and provide support to your younger brother to be entitled. Why can't you or your sister be the ones providing support instead? It is a family unit after all. \n\nMaybe, just maybe, your dad is cracking under the pressure of being the 'strong' one and just wants to get away from it all. Maybe, he's running away with his new gf as a form of escapism. \n\nHave you considered that?", "He was probably cheating on your mom before she passed", "Your dad is still the same person he was when your mom was alive, it\u2019s just obvious now how unimportant he was compared to her.

A bread truck pulled out in front of him, he didn't have enough time to stop, and died instantly on impact. The man wasn't even gone 3 months and his mother was already in relationship, and married the dude with in 6 months. Turns out she was having an affair for the past year, and her husband's death made it easy for her. It didn't last for her. New guy was abusive, and she ended up divorcing him. She never knew how lucky she really was. She had married her high school sweetheart, and he worshiped the ground she walked on. He truly loved her, and supported her in every way possible. I still feel so bad for that man til this day. \n\n\nI'm not saying your dad was having an affair. But, 2.5 months isn't even enough time to grieve the loss of a loved one like that unless they've already moved.", "NTA.\n\nWhile some people do move on fast, this disregard for your brother's grief is quite frankly, monster behaviour from a parent.\n\nIt might be how he is processing his grief - running off into a rebound relationship, running from the pain into a temporary bliss at full speed. But it won't heal him and it will likely destroy this relationship pretty fast if that is what he is doing, while also destroying your relationships with him.\n\nYou would likely be best distancing from him for a good while and see how you feel about things when his relationship has finished blowing up. Which it likely will when he can't find what he wants in this woman. He isn't going to find the relationship he had with your mum in her or the healing he needs. And she likely isn't interested in carrying the weight of his baggage.\n\nIt is up to you and your siblings if this is something you will be able to forgive him for with time and distance, or if you're too appalled to ever want to speak to him again.", "I hate to tell you this, but your dad has 100% known this woman and intended to date her (if he has not already been dating her) for a lot longer than 2 months.

Maybe grief counseling for everyone isn't a bad call.\n\nInfo - was it known to be terminal? How long was she given and how ill was she? Was your father her main carer?\n\n\nYou probably aren't privy to the intimate details they discussed before her passing. She may have encouraged him to find someone. Pure speculation would be if he was already involved prior to her passing. \n\nSome people aren't capable of being alone. Every one processes grief differently, judging or assuming anything isn't a good idea. Hiding things never works, no matter how well intentioned and always ends up worse. \n\nNTA, a gentle ESH.

It felt quick to me, but when I asked my husband how he felt about it, he said he was fine with it and that he just wanted his Dad to be happy. FYI, my FIL just turned 90 two weeks ago, and they've been married 20 years. I'm not going to label you TA or NTA here because how you feel is just how you feel. I just wanted to offer another view of the situation.

It doesn't matter how old you are, losing a parent will fuck you up. Your dad has made his choice. I think a better focus for that energy is making sure your brother is taken care of and getting the help and support he needs.", "NTA\n\nOP, what happened over the holidays?  And did your brother pass?  Has he accessed counseling (both academic and therapeutic) through his school yet?", "NTA.\n\nidk if it\u2019s just me, but everytime i see a story about one parent dying and the other moving on so fast, i feel like they have been cheating. why is it that your dad has found someone only 2.5 months after? has he been with her while with your mother? also i\u2019m not sure if you can, but please get you and your siblings to go NC or LC because the father clearly doesn\u2019t care about you guys.", "EHS. But possibly NAH. \n\nDid your parents have a good relationship? Did your dad lose a wife long before your mom died? Emotionally, physically, and sentimentally your dad probably lost his wife a long time ago due to the cancer. He possibly turned into her caregiver and wasn\u2019t cared for by her (not her fault just probably true). They probably didn\u2019t have intimacy for a while too. Although it may seem like less than a year is short, it may have been years since he\u2019s been heard or felt. If their relationship wasn\u2019t great prior to the cancer, it\u2019s possible he stuck around until she died. Shorter version: your dad may have feelings and gone through something you don\u2019t understand. \n\nYour brother is 20. He\u2019s an adult. He should voluntarily take a leave from school. There are policies in place instead of trying to simply muscle through. Sure your dad can be more supportive but so can you guys towards him. His agreeing then not following through with hiding his new relationship isn\u2019t great, but he isn\u2019t obligated to hide it either. \n\nYou\u2019re grieving and may not accept your dad\u2019s new love interest, but you\u2019re also unsupportive of him as well.

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been a tremendously difficult time for all and will take much more time to heal.\n\nThe degree of your dad\u2019s AH-ness depends on how his new relationship developed. I mean if your dad\u2019s out on Tinder after the terminal diagnosis, that\u2019s super shitty. If it\u2019s someone he met through grief or support counseling where both partners bonded over loss, that\u2019s completely different - and you should cut him some slack if that\u2019s the case. Just to recap, your mother was terminal for 2+ years and off treatment for the last 6-7 months before her death. Not saying it\u2019s right, but the marriage may have felt over for those last 2+ years.

They don't have to be anything formal, I think the r/widowers group was actually decent if I recall, and they should read up on what other people are experiencing. Whether OP realizes it or not, a *lot* of people have already started dating at two months in. A lot of people also fall prey to scammers they think they're dating or various other people who are taking advantage of them at two to three months in (that happened to me and I certainly hadn't been *trying* to date, there are ways people consciously or unconsciously take advantage of new widows and widowers).\n\nAt the end of the day, it's completely understandable that OP and her siblings *don't* get why these things happen, I certainly wouldn't have after my mom died, but it certainly makes a lot more sense after having had to deal with losing my spouse.", "Actions definitely have consequences, and sometimes grief tears families apart.
