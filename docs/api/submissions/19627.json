My bf (30m) and I (28f) have been toghere for 7 years. A lot of things has happend during our relationship but latley he has been financially abusing me. Using the fact that I can't find a job (he made me quit my previous one) and that he paid for some of my studies against me. I have asked my parents to help me get out of my situation and they have slowley gathered some of the money that I need to pay him back. I want to do this, because he did this with his previous ex, paying some of her things and HIS MOTHER of all people took her to court to get back that money and she won. So I just want a clean financial break from him. At the end of July is when my parents said they'll have the money they need to give to me. (I'll be paying them back as soon as I find a job don't worry.) \n\nSo the story: His parents and one of his sisters are coming to the country at the end of June. His parents are staying with us for a week.  I was not informed of this and when I voiced my opinion he said it's his house and he can do what he wants. So I'm going to be stuck with his parents during the day. And then the next week we are all going on a vaction. Staying in one house.   \n\n\nI dont like his parents. ESPECIALLY his mother. She treats me like a maid and a babysitter and they never talk to me about anything. They talk over me, undermine me, judge my decisions and the last  vacation we took with them, his mother and sisters completely ignored me. It was a horrible time. When I told him he said It was my fault.   \nAlso when we go visit my parents for 5 days he takes his gaming pc with him and he will sit in the room for 6 -8 hours and game, only coming out when theres food. He doesn't speak to my parents. And I'll be the first one to say that in the beginning my father and bf did have some dissagreements but MY DAD actually went and appologzed too him, taking him out for beer. \n\nI am not allowed to take my computer. Also, I wouldn't want to because his niece, which will be there steels my stuff. The last vaction she stole my phone case OF MY FUCKING PHONE 3 SHIRST AND MONEY and when I confronted her the whole family ganged up on me saying that she's a troubled youth. I got my phone case back and one shirt, because she lost the other 2 and spent my money.  \n\n\nSo i want to know if I'll be the asshole in telling him that I think he deveserves family time and he should have quality time with them. And I could go home and work part time at a friend of my dad's for 2 weeks for some extra cash (to pay him back)?", "created_utc": 1686751303, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1498out/wibta_if_i_tell_my_bf_to_go_on_his_family_trip/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When he leaves take all your things and move out. He's an abuser who is enabled by his family to do so. Leave and sort out the money later. If he takes you to court that won't happen for a while and you will probably have paid off everything by then. Make sure you have checks written to pay off things.", "NTA, hope you can get out of this situation as soon as possible as it really doesn\u2019t sound healthy", "Break up. Imagine this situation long term? \ud83d\ude33 \n\nYou put 7 years in, and that sounds like a lot. But imagine his behavior in 20 years? It's only going to get worse. With financial abuse, more money doesn't mean that it stops, it just means that they will find new inventive ways to keep you locked in.\n\nPay him off and get out.\n\nNtA", "NTA. For dealing with the immediate question, that's actually a really good idea (except don't tell him a bout the part time work).\n\nWhat I don't understand though is why you are waiting to get out. Leave now. Whether you can go live with your parents again or a friend, don't wait. Pack up, make sure you only take what is 100% yours (consider leaving any gifts from him as well, or anything he's bought you that you absolutely don't need), and be gone while he's at work.\n\nGet yourself a job, and between what you and your parents have saved up, pay him back. Make sure everything is documented (so make sure to do an e-transfer or bank draft, don't just give him cash). \n\nIf you don't have the money now to pay him back, that's ok. Courts aren't instant. Make it a top priority to pay him back. Pay in installments. If you get served, make the first installment payment. Show the courts you are working on it and let them know when the next installment will be, and how many total payments will happen.", "NTA. I'm confused as to why you are with him, are you using the money your parents give you to move out? I think that needs to be your priority right now. I've been financially abused (among other abuse), it only ever gets worse, never better. RUN.", "NTA and honestly how have you been with him 7 years if his family is like this, if my partner and their family were like this I woulda dumped all their asses years ago.\n\n\nGetting you to quit your job and then complaining about your money situation is like shooting yourself in the foot and asking why it hurts.\n\nDoesn't really sound like much of a relationship just a friends (if you can call it that) with benefits situation, he is treating you extremely poorly and showing a lot of disrespect to your family on your visits to them but after hearing about his family I am 100% not surprised.\n\nThe fact that he even has a history of this is a big red flag for me as well, nothing wrong in moving back in with parents whilst you get things sorted.", "Just leave. Let him try and sue you for your \"debts,\" but you are behaving like an indentured servant - that's not necessary. Get out now, get a lawyer, and let him take you to court - he probably won't win a dime, but even if he does, it will be worth it for your freedom.", "NTA. Get out now. Give him what money you have along with a notarized letter of intent to pay him back with a payment schedule. Pay him by check so you proof of payments. He doesn't get to tell you what you can or can't do. You live in his house and he can't kick you out without an eviction notice, I don't care what he says, he can't just kick you out on a whim. Let him go on vacation and then you move out while he's gone.", "NTA - Take anything valuable and go back home.

Good luck on this!!", "NTA - if you have been in a long term relationship with someone they should want to help you with your studies.

Can you use the time he's with his family to get out?\n\nAlso, talk to a lawyer about having to pay back.  Don't you think you've lost enough with him getting you to quit your job?  You wouldn't need money if he hadn't done that.  Also, not sure how enforceable it is if you guys didn't sign a contract saying that you'd pay it back or whatever.  I suspect you don't have the full story about what happened with his other girlfriend.  They've told you just enough to keep you in line.\n\nI would also organise to have someone else in the house at the time they are leaving to go on vacation.  Someone who is on your side. I don't doubt he'll be an utter ass to you (plus his families behaviour) as they're packing up to leave.

By the time it goes to court, you\u2019ll have the money.  Don\u2019t let her behavior force you to stay with her abusive son.  Get out and don\u2019t look back.  It takes one day to grab your stuff and go.  You thinking you have to stay is because he\u2019s convinced you, you did something wrong.  You didn\u2019t except choosing him.  His behavior is red flag city.", "NTA but wondering why you don't simply break up? If you really want to pay him back you can continue to do so after breaking up.
