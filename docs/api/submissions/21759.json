Wanting to plan ahead isn't the bad thing.\n\nAnd while I understand the frustration in dealing with someone who waits to the last minute to decide on where to eat (and many times given multiple locations to go but they're like \"Na, I don't feel like that) every time we go out, you have to remember you're in a relationship. That means you need to set aside what you want to do, and compromise with your wife. If that means occasionally being spontaneous and going outside your neighborhood at a moments notice, there's also nothing wrong with that.", "NAH, it sounds like you and your wife have different preferences for how to plan things. I completely understand, I also need at least a day's notice to wrap my mind around doing something out of my comfort zone. I would be unlikely to go far away from my house on such short notice as well. That being said, this is your wife, and you are going to presumably be with her for the rest of your life or a long time, so both of you will probably need to compromise on this.", "NAH - I think 24 hours is reasonable esp if you have to get reservations, and just because it's not cost prohibitive doesn't mean it's not more expensive. I think you also have to factor in plans of what you're usually able to come home, and just head to dinner within a 10 block radius. I feel like there's a compromise to be made here - maybe just have a set plan on when you're going out/staying in the neighborhood. You don't have to pick the places, but you know when to a lot more time?", "Soft ESH. I relate to wanting advance notice for planning purposes and it\u2019s obnoxious when people who want to do everything spur of the moment think their way is better and force people to go along with it without considering the potential anxiety that arises. *Wanting to know what\u2019s going to happen in advance is a valid desire.* That said I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to require her to bend to your way either. I think you both need to work with each other. I think you could have a productive conversation about each of your personal preferences and word it more as a gentle request (can you try to give me notice? And/or are there any restaurants on your bucket list I can reserve weeks in advance to look forward to as a special night out?) and try to come up compromises. I also think that you could propose something like every other Saturday we eat somewhere outside the neighborhood but she doesn\u2019t have to decide where until day of. Or what about something like every third Thursday we eat in X area, or whatever.

It's really not all that abnormal and I highly doubt it's an American thing, there are still plenty of people that do meal prep as well, I'd say almost equally as many as those that don't meal prep. I'd say anything more than 12 hours advance for something like going to grab dinner at x restaurant instead of y restaurant is more than reasonable when there's no reservations in the question. Especially considering it doesn't sound like it even matters to op what restaurant she chooses so he wouldn't care about the notice as long as it's walking distance. It's not about what to eat it's about how far to go to get the food.
