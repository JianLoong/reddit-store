It can often add 30% to the total cost of dinner or an additional hour of transit time. It makes it more difficult and detracting from the experience. My wife and I both enjoy walking, so walking home from dinner is a treat.\n\nFurthermore, I often agree to spontaneous plans. But I\u2019ve communicated to my wife that I would like to know the day prior if it\u2019s going to be a costly or time consuming trip to eat out. \n\nI feel like a notice period in general is already a compromise. 24 hours is I agree arbitrary, but I would like any time the day before.\n\nI feel much more strongly about eating in my neighborhood than my wife feels about eating outside our neighborhood which is why I feel this is an appropriate compromise.\n\nI (36m) live in a major metropolitan city in a neighborhood known for excellent restaurants, bars, etc. My wife (33F) and I love eating out in our neighborhood restaurants and bars. Our neighborhood has some of our favorite restaurants and bars in the city, and every price point, cuisine, and vibe is available within a 10 block radius.\n\nI typically prefer eating in our neighborhood. However, I still will make us reservations all over the city. When we do eat outside of our own neighborhood it costs additional time and money due to additional transportation (ie uber, public transportation, etc) which is why I\u2019ve asked my wife if she wants to eat outside of our neighborhood, she needs to plan it 24 hours in advance. To be clear, the additional transportation cost is not cost prohibitive. \n\nShe thinks this is a ridiculous requirement. I feel that it\u2019s not that difficult of a request. To be clear, we frequently walk and do errands in adjacent neighborhoods. It\u2019s not like we never leave our neighborhood.\n\nI look forward to plans outside of our neighborhood when they\u2019re made in advance. My wife likes to hold out until the last minute because she can\u2019t make up her mind until the day of. I completely understand not knowing what you want to eat but given that you can find anything in our neighborhood she can generally find what she\u2019s looking for without needing to leaving the neighborhood. I want her to get what she wants, but I also feel like it\u2019s okay to factor in my own preferences, which is planning ahead.

Why?  Do you need to be mentally prepared for an uber?  You have to plot out the bus/subway route and all this takes a full 24 hours????\n\nThat is a rule without any logic.

Even if you want to plan ahead, I can't see any reason to ask for 24 hours notice.

The entire point of Ubers, taxis and public transit is you can use them right away at any time.

Unless the restaurants she wants to go to are so busy you aren\u2019t able to get a reservation day of, which you never mention is an issue, then this really seems like the 24 hours is completely unnecessary.

You are acting like an assy maitre d'", "I think it\u2019s one thing to request notice if you\u2019re just a planner or especially neurodivergent in some way that makes it helpful (if you have autism or PTSD or something) but a strict 24 hour notice requirement that doesn\u2019t seem to actually have a clear purpose is too much. Look, I\u2019m a planner, and honestly I often can\u2019t really enjoy spontaneous things (neurodivergence, mostly) so I get liking a plan, and I could even see how \u201cthe neighborhood\u201d negates a need for a plan and still feels comfortable if you have some kind of mental health need! But you have to compromise too and address that with your wife better if that\u2019s the issue. I\u2019d say light YTA for the inflexibility, especially since it\u2019s really unclear what you\u2019re trying to accomplish except discourage going out of neighborhood (& you\u2019re doing that passive aggressively).", "...oh give me a break, dude.\n\nNAH, but stop micromanaging your wife.  If you don't want to go, don't go, but this is ridiculous.", "NAH\n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting to plan things out ahead of time. It makes things a lot easier as you know where you're going, what time you want to go, how you're getting there/getting back (especially if you're taking public transportation), ensuring the place caters to your needs in case you have food allergies, etc. etc.. Wanting to plan ahead isn't the bad thing.\n\nAnd while I understand the frustration in dealing with someone who waits to the last minute to decide on where to eat (and many times given multiple locations to go but they're like \"Na, I don't feel like that) every time we go out, you have to remember you're in a relationship. That means you need to set aside what you want to do, and compromise with your wife. If that means occasionally being spontaneous and going outside your neighborhood at a moments notice, there's also nothing wrong with that.", "NAH, it sounds like you and your wife have different preferences for how to plan things. I completely understand, I also need at least a day's notice to wrap my mind around doing something out of my comfort zone. I would be unlikely to go far away from my house on such short notice as well. That being said, this is your wife, and you are going to presumably be with her for the rest of your life or a long time, so both of you will probably need to compromise on this.", "NAH - I think 24 hours is reasonable esp if you have to get reservations, and just because it's not cost prohibitive doesn't mean it's not more expensive. I think you also have to factor in plans of what you're usually able to come home, and just head to dinner within a 10 block radius. I feel like there's a compromise to be made here - maybe just have a set plan on when you're going out/staying in the neighborhood. You don't have to pick the places, but you know when to a lot more time?", "Soft ESH. I relate to wanting advance notice for planning purposes and it\u2019s obnoxious when people who want to do everything spur of the moment think their way is better and force people to go along with it without considering the potential anxiety that arises. *Wanting to know what\u2019s going to happen in advance is a valid desire.* That said I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to require her to bend to your way either. I think you both need to work with each other. I think you could have a productive conversation about each of your personal preferences and word it more as a gentle request (can you try to give me notice? And/or are there any restaurants on your bucket list I can reserve weeks in advance to look forward to as a special night out?) and try to come up compromises. I also think that you could propose something like every other Saturday we eat somewhere outside the neighborhood but she doesn\u2019t have to decide where until day of. Or what about something like every third Thursday we eat in X area, or whatever. Which would give you advance notice that things are different that day but the actual restaurant is still spur of the moment for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then I pack my cycling bag with whatever clothes I need (including sports bra, appropriate footwear, weather gear\u2026) I would get extremely stressed if my partner randomly decided to go out to restaurants across the city just a couple hours before because I\u2019d need to make sure I can leave my bike someplace safe (especially in the city center, bikes are often stolen), or have a public transport route planned, and have appropriate clothes! I also live a bit outside of the city, so it takes a lot of effort to get in and out and travel around it. \n\nBut I also have general anxiety disorder and the chaos of the city center in rush hour can get really overwhelming for me, even if I\u2019ve planned in advance. I\u2019ve also been dealing with some health issues for the last couple of years that leave me fatigued and feeling crappy a lot of the time, so I really look forward to quiet nights at home! I can only go out a couple of nights a week without feeling too exhausted - even just going to work and doing nothing else is exhausting for me. \n\nMaybe a hard an fast 24 hour \u201crule\u201d seems a bit extreme, but I think it\u2019s fair for him to ask for advanced notice so he can plan his days or mentally prepare or whatever he needs. Really surprised by the answers in this thread. NAH - can understand that she also likes spontaneity. I think they just need to communicate effectively and find a good compromise.", "It feels like it\u2019s written to be strict, but I also think there are compromises, like she could give a heads up she\u2019s thinking of wanting to go out of the neighborhood tomorrow, most of the time, but it\u2019s not a forever/always \u201crule\u201d just that it\u2019s harder for OP to enjoy spontaneous plans outside. I would imagine she will have more fun if OP can enjoy it too but I think the rigidity of the way OP is approaching it is perhaps hindering her fun. \n\nMore communication and compromise and they could potentially figure out cadences that work, but OP may have to relax the rule mindset or at least make the rules more complicated and below the surface (so they aren\u2019t explicit to the spouse and ruining her fun). Maybe she doesn\u2019t need to make up her mind completely but suggest maybe X or Y and she\u2019ll communicate more tomorrow etc.", "Exactly, not diagnosing them but it does seem that way. My mother is exactly the same and it can be a handful but I can completely understand feeling like you need to know what the plan is and what\u2019s going on.", "We r just judging based on the info presented. He didn\u2019t say anything about neurodivergence so it\u2019s not part of the calculation. It\u2019s not up to us to figure out why someone acts a way only to judge their actions based on the self provided info. If there was an update \u201cI have ND\u201d then I\u2019d change my vote. But not because he might have it when he doesn\u2019t say it.", "I personnaly hate last minute change of plan. Maybe it's an introvert thing ?

With a bit of notice, I can better *brace for impact*.", "What requirement is his wife making?", "Honestly? It\u2019s not an introvert/extrovert thing to not be spontaneous. I\u2019m very extroverted but I like plans, gives me a good idea of my day and how to plan it. I have shit I need to get done and if I\u2019m anticipating 2 hours for dinner in the area and my SO decides he wants to do dinner somewhere else that will take 3 hours or more that\u2019s a whole hour of stuff that\u2019s not getting done.", "Because he's using his personal preference in an attempt to control his partner's life and modify her behavior.

Weird that that's offensive.", "u/Oldladygaming and u/loohahoohaa yup seems this thread is full of ableism. To be clear, I am autistic and also an introvert so that's exactly why I can relate. And I didn't tell him he didn't need to work on it on his end, just that his literal feelings are valid. Pretty disgusting when you think about it.", "Yeah but you simply say \"nah, I can't\". You don't go around enforcing rules. I think if he had just turned down the girlfriend, or talked to her putting it like \"it really messes with me to not have a lot of notice and I can't organise my days like this, there's an high chance I'll just turn it down. If you want to be sure we go out, tell me the day before.\" It would have been as you said, but why go and put a rule. It's just weird", "I get you. I am like that, too. Even if I don't even need to prepare anything, I need to prepare myself mentally. But, it is my issue. They can accommodate me, but if they can't, I will deal with it somehow by resting after the whole event or something. I don't make rules, I ask them if they can do that for me.", "Its going to dinner. Its no different if its 5 minutes away or 20.", "Not to be pedantic but that still sounds like control to me. Just not control of other people, rather control of oneself and your own ability to plan and prepare.", "If you read my comment again, you will see that I am not necessarily talking about controlling other people. I was quite vague, to encompass controlling people\u2019s environment. Like he wants to be in control of everything that is happening to him always.\n\nAnd I will just add that I was also like this few years back - had routine that made me feel safe and I had to have advance warning for any hangouts with friends. I was convinced my life is amazing. And then I got worse which forced me to seek help. Only after that, thanks to therapy and medication I actually realised how I was holding myself back in life and in relationships with people.\n\nBut, hey, it very well might be just me. Not necessarily saying it\u2019s your issue as well, even if your comment describes perfectly me few years back, there probably is a lot more to the story with you.", "but clearly for OP, it *is* about control. He doesn't have issues with spontaneity when it's going somewhere in their neighborhood, but wants her to give notice when she wants to go somewhere else.

I\u2019m ND and kinda have an opposite iteration of the same problem. I can do spontaneous plans but I hate when other people cancel plans (admittedly I don\u2019t hate it when I cancel the plans.) this is because I\u2019ve built my schedule for the day around a plan, and if last minute that plan falls apart I can kinda get stuck not knowing what to do. I have had to do a lot of mental work to be less rigid and so far all I\u2019ve really succeeded in is just masking my inner turmoil better so I don\u2019t take it out on others. \n\nOP needs to work on his flexibility, IMO. He isn\u2019t necessarily being maliciously controlling but he\u2019s definitely trying to control the situation to assuage whatever his brain is telling him.", "Yeah if it\u2019s the case there\u2019s certainly a way to bring up his needs without sounding like a controlling ah.

I love to eat and don\u2019t mind going different places but I drive. There are other times where I HAVE to have advanced notice or I won\u2019t go.

OP should just say so.", "Expectation of following through with last minute plans, that itself is a requirement.", "As an european, your american \"small trips\" are big.

In my own life, I tell people I need warning and decline if they don\u2019t give it.", "Exactly. It\u2019s different when you are married. There\u2019s no room for my way or the high way in a healthy marriage", "I mean, it's different if you can walk vs having to take an Uber or figure out public transport. I still think the dude's an AH, but I can see why the two things are different as he described - I'm assuming they don't have a car.", "They are going to an unfamiliar place, it is different than a familiar place.", "He needs to get therapy to sort this out because it is not fair for him to prioritize his feelings as \"needs\" and call his wife's \"wants.\" This is not a compromise and he's forcing his wife to carry the burden of his own anxiety. I'm neurodivergent myself, but you can't make your issues a problem for someone else. You are responsible for dealing with them in a healthy way that doesn't impose arbitrary, draconian restrictions on other people.", "Thats not whats going on here. OP's wife likes to branch out and try restaraunts in new areas every once in a while, shes not controlling or entitled for wanting to do this. OP's rules dont make any sense.

Does your neighbourhood take 1 hour to leave? He said they frequently walk and do errands in other neighbourhoods", "Actual trips require planning, so knowing a week in advance is reasonable.

I don't know why that requires 24 hours notice.", "I don't think he's evil -- incarnate or otherwise.

If it's actually a lot of times as he seems to imply, I think he would have a point.

It is different when it comes to your spouse as you have a different relationship with them than you do anybody else.

But this guy is trying to argue that his similar feelings should allow him to make a rule that requires his wife to honor these feelings.  That's control.   A better approach for people like us is to say, \"I really do much better if I have more notice.   Can you try to plan ahead as often as possible?\"  That's advocating for what you need or prefer.

It starts with them starting with control over small things to see how you react. And then they just make their influence bigger over time, so you are like that frog that gets cooked because it was stuck in cold water and doesnt notice temperature rising with time, but would jump out if thrown to boiling one.\n\nTo me the story seems controlling, but i am more leaning towards OP being afraid over losing control over their own life than being an abuser.

It\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison between what he wants vs what she wants. What he wants is to eat in the neighborhood, exclusively.
