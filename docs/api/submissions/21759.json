You\u2019re being ridiculous.", "YTA\n\n1) You don't mind leaving the neighborhood for restaurants/evening out\n2) You do in fact do this and have looked forward to these outings (you do admit when planned in advance)\n3) The only reason stated is it takes \"additional time and money do to transportation. but its not the money but seemingly the time to get there? \n4) You then establish some rule that has no rationale, That you need 24 hours in advance?  Why?  Do you need to be mentally prepared for an uber?  You have to plot out the bus/subway route and all this takes a full 24 hours????\n\nThat is a rule without any logic.  Look, you're saying you have no problem going out of the neighborhood, then do it.  What is the downside, ... It'll make your wife happy and you have a good time when you do it, so drop the vapid 24 hour non-existent excuse.", "YTA\n\n24 hours notice doesn\u2019t do anything to change how much it costs to leave your neighborhood so it\u2019s unclear why you even brought that up. \n\nIt seems like your issue is you just don\u2019t like the hassle of traveling farther than you need to. That\u2019s valid to a point but your solution doesn\u2019t make sense. \n\nA better approach would be to agree to try to limit out of neighborhood eating to some certain number of times per week.

Your request for not leaving the neighborhood is.... odd at best, concerning at worst. Your preference IS being taken into account because 90% of the time you're already eating in your neighborhood at the restaurants you prefer.

Even if you want to plan ahead, I can't see any reason to ask for 24 hours notice. Wanting to plan ahead is fine but, unless there's some information you left out about needing to get reservations or something, asking for this much notice is completely unreasonable. Mostly just seems like you're trying to sabotage any attempts to go to the other neighborhood.", "YTA, how in anyway does needing to take an Uber require 24 hours advanced notice? The entire point of Ubers, taxis and public transit is you can use them right away at any time. I\u2019m all for respecting others preferences but this is so completely arbitrary I really don\u2019t understand the need. Unless the restaurants she wants to go to are so busy you aren\u2019t able to get a reservation day of, which you never mention is an issue, then this really seems like the 24 hours is completely unnecessary.

Just have a talk and say how much you\u2019d appreciate it if he can give you a heads up you want but if she has short notice, let it be, don\u2019t even bring it up.", "Have you considered getting an ankle tag fitted to her mate?", "YTA.

It\u2019s time to learn how to be a partner.", "YTA-are you seriously expecting her to give you 24 hours notice for a restaurant outside of your neighborhood?  That is the most RIDICULOUS thing I have ever heard in my life.  Next I\u2019ll be expecting a post from your wife stating that you are expecting her to cover the transportation costs when you do eat outside of your neighborhood. You are weirdly controlling about such an inane thing.", "YTA.  You are acting like an assy maitre d'", "I think it\u2019s one thing to request notice if you\u2019re just a planner or especially neurodivergent in some way that makes it helpful (if you have autism or PTSD or something) but a strict 24 hour notice requirement that doesn\u2019t seem to actually have a clear purpose is too much. Look, I\u2019m a planner, and honestly I often can\u2019t really enjoy spontaneous things (neurodivergence, mostly) so I get liking a plan, and I could even see how \u201cthe neighborhood\u201d negates a need for a plan and still feels comfortable if you have some kind of mental health need! But you have to compromise too and address that with your wife better if that\u2019s the issue. I\u2019d say light YTA for the inflexibility, especially since it\u2019s really unclear what you\u2019re trying to accomplish except discourage going out of neighborhood (& you\u2019re doing that passive aggressively).", "...oh give me a break, dude.\n\nNAH, but stop micromanaging your wife.  If you don't want to go, don't go, but this is ridiculous.", "NAH\n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting to plan things out ahead of time. It makes things a lot easier as you know where you're going, what time you want to go, how you're getting there/getting back (especially if you're taking public transportation), ensuring the place caters to your needs in case you have food allergies, etc. etc.. Wanting to plan ahead isn't the bad thing.\n\nAnd while I understand the frustration in dealing with someone who waits to the last minute to decide on where to eat (and many times given multiple locations to go but they're like \"Na, I don't feel like that) every time we go out, you have to remember you're in a relationship. That means you need to set aside what you want to do, and compromise with your wife. If that means occasionally being spontaneous and going outside your neighborhood at a moments notice, there's also nothing wrong with that.", "NAH, it sounds like you and your wife have different preferences for how to plan things. I completely understand, I also need at least a day's notice to wrap my mind around doing something out of my comfort zone. I would be unlikely to go far away from my house on such short notice as well. That being said, this is your wife, and you are going to presumably be with her for the rest of your life or a long time, so both of you will probably need to compromise on this.", "NAH - I think 24 hours is reasonable esp if you have to get reservations, and just because it's not cost prohibitive doesn't mean it's not more expensive. I think you also have to factor in plans of what you're usually able to come home, and just head to dinner within a 10 block radius. I feel like there's a compromise to be made here - maybe just have a set plan on when you're going out/staying in the neighborhood. You don't have to pick the places, but you know when to a lot more time?", "Soft ESH. I relate to wanting advance notice for planning purposes and it\u2019s obnoxious when people who want to do everything spur of the moment think their way is better and force people to go along with it without considering the potential anxiety that arises. *Wanting to know what\u2019s going to happen in advance is a valid desire.* That said I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to require her to bend to your way either. I think you both need to work with each other. I think you could have a productive conversation about each of your personal preferences and word it more as a gentle request (can you try to give me notice? And/or are there any restaurants on your bucket list I can reserve weeks in advance to look forward to as a special night out?) and try to come up compromises. I also think that you could propose something like every other Saturday we eat somewhere outside the neighborhood but she doesn\u2019t have to decide where until day of. Or what about something like every third Thursday we eat in X area, or whatever. Which would give you advance notice that things are different that day but the actual restaurant is still spur of the moment for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
