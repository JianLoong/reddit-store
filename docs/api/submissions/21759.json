It can often add 30% to the total cost of dinner or an additional hour of transit time. It makes it more difficult and detracting from the experience. My wife and I both enjoy walking, so walking home from dinner is a treat.\n\nFurthermore, I often agree to spontaneous plans. But I\u2019ve communicated to my wife that I would like to know the day prior if it\u2019s going to be a costly or time consuming trip to eat out. \n\nI feel like a notice period in general is already a compromise. 24 hours is I agree arbitrary, but I would like any time the day before.\n\nI feel much more strongly about eating in my neighborhood than my wife feels about eating outside our neighborhood which is why I feel this is an appropriate compromise.\n\nI (36m) live in a major metropolitan city in a neighborhood known for excellent restaurants, bars, etc. My wife (33F) and I love eating out in our neighborhood restaurants and bars. Our neighborhood has some of our favorite restaurants and bars in the city, and every price point, cuisine, and vibe is available within a 10 block radius.\n\nI typically prefer eating in our neighborhood. However, I still will make us reservations all over the city. When we do eat outside of our own neighborhood it costs additional time and money due to additional transportation (ie uber, public transportation, etc) which is why I\u2019ve asked my wife if she wants to eat outside of our neighborhood, she needs to plan it 24 hours in advance. To be clear, the additional transportation cost is not cost prohibitive. \n\nShe thinks this is a ridiculous requirement. I feel that it\u2019s not that difficult of a request. To be clear, we frequently walk and do errands in adjacent neighborhoods. It\u2019s not like we never leave our neighborhood.\n\nI look forward to plans outside of our neighborhood when they\u2019re made in advance. My wife likes to hold out until the last minute because she can\u2019t make up her mind until the day of. I completely understand not knowing what you want to eat but given that you can find anything in our neighborhood she can generally find what she\u2019s looking for without needing to leaving the neighborhood. I want her to get what she wants, but I also feel like it\u2019s okay to factor in my own preferences, which is planning ahead.

Why?  Do you need to be mentally prepared for an uber?  You have to plot out the bus/subway route and all this takes a full 24 hours????\n\nThat is a rule without any logic.

Even if you want to plan ahead, I can't see any reason to ask for 24 hours notice.

The entire point of Ubers, taxis and public transit is you can use them right away at any time.

Unless the restaurants she wants to go to are so busy you aren\u2019t able to get a reservation day of, which you never mention is an issue, then this really seems like the 24 hours is completely unnecessary.

You are acting like an assy maitre d'", "I think it\u2019s one thing to request notice if you\u2019re just a planner or especially neurodivergent in some way that makes it helpful (if you have autism or PTSD or something) but a strict 24 hour notice requirement that doesn\u2019t seem to actually have a clear purpose is too much. Look, I\u2019m a planner, and honestly I often can\u2019t really enjoy spontaneous things (neurodivergence, mostly) so I get liking a plan, and I could even see how \u201cthe neighborhood\u201d negates a need for a plan and still feels comfortable if you have some kind of mental health need! But you have to compromise too and address that with your wife better if that\u2019s the issue. I\u2019d say light YTA for the inflexibility, especially since it\u2019s really unclear what you\u2019re trying to accomplish except discourage going out of neighborhood (& you\u2019re doing that passive aggressively).", "...oh give me a break, dude.\n\nNAH, but stop micromanaging your wife.  If you don't want to go, don't go, but this is ridiculous.", "NAH\n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting to plan things out ahead of time. It makes things a lot easier as you know where you're going, what time you want to go, how you're getting there/getting back (especially if you're taking public transportation), ensuring the place caters to your needs in case you have food allergies, etc. etc.. Wanting to plan ahead isn't the bad thing.\n\nAnd while I understand the frustration in dealing with someone who waits to the last minute to decide on where to eat (and many times given multiple locations to go but they're like \"Na, I don't feel like that) every time we go out, you have to remember you're in a relationship. That means you need to set aside what you want to do, and compromise with your wife. If that means occasionally being spontaneous and going outside your neighborhood at a moments notice, there's also nothing wrong with that.", "NAH, it sounds like you and your wife have different preferences for how to plan things. I completely understand, I also need at least a day's notice to wrap my mind around doing something out of my comfort zone. I would be unlikely to go far away from my house on such short notice as well. That being said, this is your wife, and you are going to presumably be with her for the rest of your life or a long time, so both of you will probably need to compromise on this.", "NAH - I think 24 hours is reasonable esp if you have to get reservations, and just because it's not cost prohibitive doesn't mean it's not more expensive. I think you also have to factor in plans of what you're usually able to come home, and just head to dinner within a 10 block radius. I feel like there's a compromise to be made here - maybe just have a set plan on when you're going out/staying in the neighborhood. You don't have to pick the places, but you know when to a lot more time?", "Soft ESH. I relate to wanting advance notice for planning purposes and it\u2019s obnoxious when people who want to do everything spur of the moment think their way is better and force people to go along with it without considering the potential anxiety that arises. *Wanting to know what\u2019s going to happen in advance is a valid desire.* That said I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to require her to bend to your way either. I think you both need to work with each other. I think you could have a productive conversation about each of your personal preferences and word it more as a gentle request (can you try to give me notice? And/or are there any restaurants on your bucket list I can reserve weeks in advance to look forward to as a special night out?) and try to come up compromises. I also think that you could propose something like every other Saturday we eat somewhere outside the neighborhood but she doesn\u2019t have to decide where until day of. Or what about something like every third Thursday we eat in X area, or whatever. Which would give you advance notice that things are different that day but the actual restaurant is still spur of the moment for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I also live a bit outside of the city, so it takes a lot of effort to get in and out and travel around it. \n\nBut I also have general anxiety disorder and the chaos of the city center in rush hour can get really overwhelming for me, even if I\u2019ve planned in advance. I\u2019ve also been dealing with some health issues for the last couple of years that leave me fatigued and feeling crappy a lot of the time, so I really look forward to quiet nights at home! I can only go out a couple of nights a week without feeling too exhausted - even just going to work and doing nothing else is exhausting for me. \n\nMaybe a hard an fast 24 hour \u201crule\u201d seems a bit extreme, but I think it\u2019s fair for him to ask for advanced notice so he can plan his days or mentally prepare or whatever he needs.

I would imagine she will have more fun if OP can enjoy it too but I think the rigidity of the way OP is approaching it is perhaps hindering her fun. \n\nMore communication and compromise and they could potentially figure out cadences that work, but OP may have to relax the rule mindset or at least make the rules more complicated and below the surface (so they aren\u2019t explicit to the spouse and ruining her fun).

I was convinced my life is amazing. And then I got worse which forced me to seek help. Only after that, thanks to therapy and medication I actually realised how I was holding myself back in life and in relationships with people.\n\nBut, hey, it very well might be just me.

I'm autistic but my bf is not and he has a similar rule as well because he's just a planner personality type of person. I don't deal well with sudden change so it works for me as well. The op and wife should definitely discuss it further bc spontaneous outings can get expensive and become a chore real quick if the last minute planning feels so tedious.", "This was my first thought too. I'm not autistic but I have diagnosed anxiety and I feel way more comfortable knowing the parameters of my day at least a day beforehand. I can cope with 'lets go to the cinema sometime this evening and see if anything good is on' because that's controlled uncertainty, but if my partner says last minute \"how would you feel about crazy golf instead of the cinema tonight' I will need to fight my anxiety, even though I like crazy golf.", "If you the OP start with \"I am nuerodivergent\" or \"I have a fear of X\"...\n\nThey go from Y-TA to N-TA.", "Its upsetting to me that i had to scroll this far down to see someone saying nta.

Last-minute plans and changes to routine can give me major anxiety, as I haven\u2019t mentally prepared for them.

I think I'm leaning towards NAH because I understand both sides really well. \n\nOP has boundaries around dates and he's entitled to them. It's a fine line sometimes between boundaries and rules but if he is okay with not having the dinner date at all if she decides to be spontaneous instead? Sounds okay to me. In the best case scenario nobody should have to change and force the other to do something they're not comfortable because everyone's needs are valid. \n\nI would suggest to OP's wife that she went out to eat with someone else than OP on days where she decides last minute (or give a heads up in advance) and for OP to accept that he might not get to go on a date then (or accept spontaneity if he feels like it) . It's only an issue when one side wants to have it their way completely. \n\nI don't necessarily believe in compromises if that means that both parties will be unhappy with the outcome but I think it's smart to dissect a want into smaller chunks (date night -> going out for dinner, socializing, time with romantic partner) and fulfill those sub-wants in a flexible way. I have no idea if this makes sense the way I'm describing it but it's a concept of non violent communication and I've found it quite helpful in my relationship.", "Part of the idk info needed for me is because the OP says because money and time, but also makes it clear money and time arent really the issue\n\nOP isn't an asshole if they need some heads up. I can understand not realizing a possible diagnosis, but they also aren't given any indication of what the actual issue for them is. They want their partner to accommodate rules that they can't even properly verbalize, even a \"I just feel extremely uncomfortable when I can't mentally prepare.\" But their wanting the gf to follow rules that don't make sense to even them and they need to figure out the issue before asking somebody else to read their minds and accommodate.

And there is nothing wrong with him wanting to know ahead of time if something that is normally an hour is gonna take 3 instead with travel time.", "That's fair - I personally understand a need to know ahead of time when it could add up to an hour to the travel time. Requires a gear switch for me mentally - but people have different needs!", "And you are controlling as well, it is not gender specific.", "Its not compromise, compromise would imply that he\u2019s willing to meet both there wants in the middle and this rule doesn\u2019t seem recent. Maybe the 90 minute travel time seems inconsequential to me because I live 20-30 min away from town so wherever we go takes 40-60 minutes, but 1 hr 30 min travel time is an excuse to have her stay in the area. OP YTA", "I am aware being controlling isn't gender specific. Just mentioned it coz the comment I responded to did so. \n\nBut seriously. Not wanting spontaneity in your life is not somehow controlling someone else's.\n\nWife is free to do what she wants to do without op. Just as my friends are free to do what they want without me.", "need more info, but leaning N A H\u2014\n\nOP, do you live in NYC, and by 'neighborhood' do you actually mean 'borough'? And do you happen to be neurodivergent?\n\nI'm getting some VERY strong vibes on both of those things, and as someone potentially in the same boat (I even suspect we might live in the same neighborhood lol)  I do have some sympathy. I very rarely say yes to truly last-minute plans in Brooklyn because that's minimum 45 min each way on the train\u2014if everything is on time and running smoothly, which it frequently isn't\u2014or a $30+ uber trip home. It's a lot of extra mental energy to take on last second.\n\nThat said, I think the 24 hour notice period is overly strict. Maybe it'd be better to aim for a set proportion of outings in your borough vs. out of borough per week, or month?", "NTA. You're getting answers from a bunch of teens and early 20s who have never been in this type of situation. I have, and it sucks. I commiserate with you. A little notice for an extra 1-2 hours tacked onto your evening helps it not kill the mood, especially if there's plans the next day and chores to do at home.", "On some level this is a compatibility issue: you prefer advance planning, she leans toward spontaneity. By itself, that's NAH. But you become TA by proposing a false compromise.\n\nYou consider the 24 hour window a compromise, but it isn't: you've gained yourself a short window of advance notice in exchange for her giving up ALL spontaneity. She has to totally abandon the option of coming up with a fun (to her) plan in the moment, while the only thing you sacrifice is the duration of the advance notice she has to provide. \n\nA true compromise would give both of you at least some of what you want, some of the time. Your \"requirement,\" on the other hand, results in you getting some of what you want and her getting none of what she wants. Talk with her about a plan you both can agree to (not a requirement from one spouse to the other), perhaps setting a max number of spontaneous outings per week/month or something that gives her some agency.", "NTA. It sounds like the OP lives in a busy city and leaving his neighborhood requires additional time, money, inconvenience, etc.  Imagine you just got home late from work and are starving.  You think you\u2019re going to pop down to the restaurant down the street where you know you can get in, no reservations and you\u2019ll be eating by 7pm and getting home early to go to work tomorrow.  Instead your significant other decides they want to Uber across town, it costs you a ton of money you weren\u2019t prepared to spend, you got home late and don\u2019t have reservations, so now it\u2019s 9:30 by the time you eat and you have to get up early for a meeting and can\u2019t enjoy yourself.  Sounds like he just wants notice so he can plan, maybe leave work on time or make reservations.  Doesn\u2019t sound controlling at all.", "NTA. It's obvious a lot of people here have never lived in a big city.", "Sorry but it seems like everyone else  ITA. OP you are NTA.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t like the added pressure that leaving the neighborhood adds to a night out and enjoys these evenings much less than a leisurely stroll to one of the many excellent local restaurants. There may also be hanger management issues here, in that a trip out of the local area means dinner is delayed to the point where OP is physically uncomfortable. \n\nMarriage is a two person job and really only works if both partners are willing to work with each other and collaborate. It sounds like OP\u201ds wife doesn\u2019t actually give one single fork about OP\u2019s preferences and has a tendency to push for dinner out of the neighborhood on a regular basis and without regard to OP\u2019s preferences or current state of mind. It probably would not have occurred to OP to make this blanket rule otherwise. \n\nIt also sounds like OP isn\u2019t great at setting boundaries and so dinner is generally eaten wherever his spouse wants. OP, how often do you get to choose the restaurant vs your spouse? Instead of being bullied by your spouse into always doing what she wants or, contrariwise, setting blanket rules, maybe you two should just take turns picking the restaurant. On your nights you can count on eating locally because it\u2019s your choice; on your wife\u2019s nights you can expect ahead of time to be eating outside the neighborhood because you know that she\u2019ll probably pick someplace further. If she surprises you occasionally by picking a local place then surprise her back on one of your nights.\n\nIf your wife doesn\u2019t agree to picking the restaurant on alternate nights then you need to find a different spouse. But it\u2019s too soon to say that now; you have to see how she responds to the suggestion.", "I think additional info is required.\n\nIs this an every time occurrence? Is this something that happens with no notice at all every single time? \n\nI\u2019m an introvert and although I like going out sometimes, I also like to make sure I\u2019ll have enough energy to enjoy it thoroughly. So I don\u2019t do very well with last minute invites because I\u2019m generally tired already at the end of the day or already have something planned for myself. \n\nSo I kind of get it wanting a bit of notice for longer more strenuous outings. Because I\u2019d like to adjust my day accordingly. \n\nI get that an specific 24h notice is a bit much for absolutely every single outing ever, but I, personally, appreciate a little heads up either the evening before or the morning of, just so I can maybe finish work earlier, make schedule transportation, change clothes or whatever.\n\nBut I also wouldn\u2019t be mad if occasionally I didn\u2019t get any notice. Somethings do happen at the spur of the moment, and I\u2019d expect the other person to be understanding that I might not have time to shower and change, might be a bit tired to be a great company or might not want to go at all.\n\nSo I\u2019ll stick with NAH for now.\n\nAnd before I go OP, you might not have a neurodivergence diagnosis yet. There are a lot of people that are getting late/adult diagnosis because the criteria has changed since we began considering it a spectrum as opposed to a fixed thing.", "Hello! I am a completely neurotypical person who does not have anxiety and is a big extrovert!\n\nNTA \n\nI love spontaneity, when it's a fun surprise or something rare. I do not want spontaneity several times a week. I like to plan ahead. At the end of the day during the week, I am happy and excited to relax and chill and recharge.\n\nI want to know the day before too if we are going to do something different. The where and when and how long to expect are important factors for me. It would affect different areas of my life and how my night will look vs how I expected it to look. \n\nA night in the neighborhood would probably have me dress pretty typical and not done up. A night out of the neighborhood and I would probably want to look nicer, have my legs shaved, hair done with make up, etc.\n\nA night out of the neighborhood means I probably need to put off certain cleaning and laundry that I could have tried to squeeze in the day before or prepare not to do until the day after.\n\nA night out of the neighborhood means I probably won't be spending extra time that night reading a book or playing video games or whatever and I would plan instead to come home and go to sleep soon after.\n\nNone of those things are problems at all, I just want to *know* what side we're going to be on the day before.", "NTA!

This just seems like practical planning so you don\u2019t have to waste money on an overpriced Uber or try to make last second plans around the public transportation schedule, even if it\u2019s not a matter of money I don\u2019t understand how people here haven\u2019t ever planned a date night before, like spontaneous dates every once in awhile is good but if she\u2019s doing this all the time then the 24hr request doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable.", "NTA. Reasonable", "nah. while you could of been nicer about it it\u2019s kinda understandable. i\u2019m neurodivergent and i need to be able to check out the menu and make sure that there is safe food i can eat and also see if where we going is super busy or not so i can put up whatever protective menta barriers i need. your wife could be more understanding about the situation however", "NTA possibly\n\nThough I do not quite agree with a alot of the ways you phrased ypur argument or your logic, I do like having notice of doing things ahead of time.

Time being an issue is understandable, but the notice OP is asking for and wants to be firm on isn\u2019t flexible enough for most. A few hours notice for a suggestion on where to eat leaves room for discussion over where to eat and to know what they will be in the mood to eat, it also means there is time to get ready. It also still leaves time for either of them to change their mind and pick somewhere closer, order in, or cook something. There is more of a middle ground they can reach.

Would it actually have cost *them* anything to decide that a little earlier?\n\nMy partner is even less spontaneous than I am, in that it's an even greater energy drain to get dragged into plans last minute.
