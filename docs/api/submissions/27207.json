You say it's 99/1, at best (and the \"1\" might be high). \n\nShe loves you, but don't trade on that and give her false hope just because you enjoy being with her. She wants to have children. You know that. You will have to be the more mature party and tell her it's unlikely and your mind is made up. Happiness with her + kid, or happiness without her? That's your ultimate decision, and you can't be wishy-washy about it for years and years. \n\nYou've had 3 years so far.

You have to decide if your life would be better without her than it would be with her and another child.", "NAH\n\nShe is allowed to change her mind, lots of people do around her age.

In my experience once a person goes down this road there is no turning back. \n\nShe was obviously not ready to let go of the idea of not having children.  You have to draw a hard line in the sand and if she is not happy with your answer I suggest moving on.   You can't force her not to have a child and she can't force you to have one.  In marriage terms this would have been called irreconcilable differences.\n\nNTA", "NAH. You were up front and initially she felt the same. Now she wants kids and you still don\u2019t.

I did read your comment that your reason may be fear that your two kids you split with your ex might resent a child with your new partner. Kids survive blended families. But it is also okay if you just don't want any more kids and are 100% set on this.\n\nBut if that is the case, you need to do the right thing and let your partner know in no uncertain terms that you are a hard no and if she wants a biological child, it will never happen with you. She is still young. She has time to break up with you and find someone else who will give her the biological children she wants. Yes it would suck to break up, but you should not feel pressured to have a child you don't want just to keep her, and she should not stay in a relationship with you if it means never having biological children of her own. You two are simply a mismatch if neither of you is willing to bend in this regard, which it seems you aren't. \n\nAnother thing you might consider is dating women who are a little bit older or who already have a kid like you do. You dated someone 5 years younger than yourself and childless. Many women in this age range want kids.", "NTA. But your relationship is already started to see the end. You do not want more children and that's perfectly fine. But it sounds like she does and it's fine for her to change her mind as well. But usually having kids is something once a woman sets her mind on wanting kids she doesn't usually change her mind back and she's going to want to partner who can give her at least one child. If that is not you, that is okay but you should probably start considering ending the relationship so she can find somebody who will give her the child that she wants", "NTA\nGet a vasectomy. Tell her you aren't having anymore and you are having the surgery. You two are not compatible if she wants children and you don't. This is a deal breaker.", "NAH. You haven't lied about having or not having kids in the future. It's a big live changing decision and there is no real compromise. Have a serious talk with your partner about your future. If she really wants a child, you have to let her go.", "NAH but you need to have the conversation. You may not want the relationship to end but it may have to. You shouldn't be forced to have more kids, she shouldn't have to live without kids if she wants them.

There\u2019s always a huge risk of getting attached to the kids and then you break up and she has no rights to them. \n\nShe\u2019s not wrong for wanting to have a family. Just like you aren\u2019t wrong for not wanting more. Don\u2019t waste each others time though.

Please be responsible for your own fertility!!", "YTA for this: \n\n> I'm worried that if we have another conversation about my position, it will signal the beginning of the end of our relationship.\n\nI don't know how long this dynamic has existed and whether you're actually actively avoiding this conversation, but it's wildly unfair to her. If your relationship is only sustained by avoiding the subject of a major incompatibility, it should end. \n\nYou said she supported you. If your course of action is to be dishonest with her in a bid to keep her in a relationship under false pretenses, that seems more like *using* her than accepting her support.", "I have to say NTA, but I do think people like you are typically AHish. You said you didn't want more and found a partner that didn't want kids. There is your mistake. You want someone willing to raise only your kids. Now, after existing with your family, she wants the life experience of having a child. That thing you and your ex experienced that she is helping to care for. So again, NTA, but some clown behavior for wanting a mother for his children, that also doesn't want kids of their own and being surprised at this outcome.\n\nEDIT: also break up with her. Think about your expectations out of future relationships. You're asking a lot out of another person. Perhaps look for someone else with children as well? For perspective.", "NTA at all. This isn't something new, it's been talked about many times previously.\nChanging your mind on wanting kids bc your partner now wants one could lead to resentment and many other things. It's not fair to you, not fair to her and most importantly, not fair for the child.", "NTA but understand that this is most often a deal breaker in relationships.", "NTA. Having kids a huge undertaking in the best of circumstances.", "NTA, never feel guilted into having kids.\n\nMy wife never wanted children & I was not bothered, if she had wanted them I would have been happy, but I do not mind that she did not.  \n\n\nThe problem is if you do not want them then you are likely to grow to resent them, your partner will know you never really wanted them.\n\nIf this is a key part of you relationship then agreeing or disagreeing will potentially result in the end of the relationship, but agreeing will also bring a 3rd party into that breakup.  \n\n\nIf your partner really wants them so much then perhaps it is time to discuss if the relationship has a future", "NTA  Time to move on my friend. This is a deal breaker for both of you.", "NAH. It sounds like you do need to sit down with your partner and discuss this because if things have changed for her and she *does* want kids but you still don\u2019t, it might be time to part ways even if everything else is great between you. Having kids just because your partner wants them is a recipe for disaster and it\u2019s not fair to either of you to stay in this relationship if you aren\u2019t on the same page about this. Delaying the inevitable helps no one as much as it will hurt. Based on your post, I think you already know this deep down.", "NAH \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly ok for a 20-something to realize they actually want kids of their own just like it\u2019s totally fine for to not want any more kid. Those 2 positions however are not compatible. Don\u2019t lead her on, evade the discussion or push it to later, it\u2019d be unfair to her. If she wants children, it\u2019ll have to be with someone other than you", "NAH.", "NAH. I\u2019ve been in this exact situation. You need to again directly tell her you are not interested in any more children.

YWBTA for staying and hoping she changes her mind if you do think she wants her own kids.\n\nThis issue has come up again and again on both sides and the general consensus is that a person is TA for staying in a relationship where the expectation on kids is not clear. It will lead to resentment in the future if you are forced to have more kids or she is forced to give up on her wish to have them.", "NTA but you need to be clear to her that you don\u2019t want more kids. She is 29. Her clock is ticking and she needs that info to decide what her future looks like, with you or without you. I know you said she\u2019s been mostly not interested in having kids  previously but she would not be the first stepmother to decide that if she\u2019s doing the (not very fun) hard work of parenting kids who don\u2019t necessarily love her or have a bond with her, that she might as well have a kid of her own to get some joy out of the parenting effort.", "NAH unless you guys bring a kid into this. You have every right to stand by your guns and she can leave.", "NTA. No one should be pressured to have kids. If you don't want them, you don't want them. That being said, kids are important to a lot of people and a dealbreaker. If your partner ends up wanting them, you will stop being compatible in life wants/choices. Which is fine even if sad. It's better to split as friends over differing wants than to give in and end up resenting your partner, kids and life in general.", "If you two are going to have a big life difference like this it might not work out even if you love each other. I'd be very frank to her upfront that you never want *any* more kids, but you love her and understand if that's a dealbreaker for her.

You don't want kids. Be honest with her and yourself. \n\nIf she wants kids, the kindest thing you can do as a loving partner if tell her NOW\n\nStringing her along in any way, or delaying the conversation, would be selfish on your part.

If you care for her, be honest, and if needed, let her go.", "NTA. You have thoroughly explored your reasons. They remain valid. She needs to either freeze eggs or conceive fairly soon if she wants kids. Ethically, you need to end the relationship. I'm sorry.\n\nPlease consider a vasectomy. It will do a great deal for your peace of mind, and prevent this situation from recurring.", "NTA but you will be TA if you're not completely honest about not changing your position.

That's fine with me now because I love my step children more than I ever thought possible. She's been in these kids lives since they were toddlers, she's had years to bond with and parent them. I feel for her though. It took me quite a few years to accept I wouldn't have biological children but accepting that was very freeing and allowed me to love the kids I do have even that much more.", "It's nowhere near the same thing. Having your own family is very far from living with your partners kids with someone else.", "As you say though, your situation is a bit different cause there was less choice involved. \n\nNot to in any way diminish step parenting- I'm from a blended family and just starting as a step parent too - in OP's case arguably the easiest way to make his gf a part of the family is to have a child with her.", "Not the same situation as here. His gf wants her own biological kids and should be able to have them if she wants. He needs to be honest about his intentions."]}
