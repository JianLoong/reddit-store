Also, do you really think she's going to pay you back?\n\n\\[Edit\\] Okay, so from your OP edit I can see that she has paid back money that you have lent to her previously, so I take my second comment back.\n\nHowever, believing that she's going to suddenly become more responsible with her finances once she's on a better income is naive, I'm afraid. She'll simply have more money to squander on unnecessary stuff and you'll just continue to be frustrated with her.\n\nSo while I'm going to go with NTA, you need to open your eyes and not allow yourself to be taken advantage of by her anymore. She needs to be open to working out a personal budget with your help for next year so that she doesn't end up having to borrow from you again.\n\n\\[Edit #2\\] You need to insist that she pays her share of the rent while she's away.", "INFO: What are your ages? And is she responsible otherwise or does she act out in ways other than in her financial responsibility. It's not an excuse for her to act out, but there are mental health conditions that if left untreated can cause someone to not be financially responsible so I'm wondering if it's age, lack of teaching, or mental health related.\n\nRegardless, NTA because she lives there, too, she should be paying her share of the bills. It's not like she's going to be gone the entire month and her things will still be in the apartment/home you rent together.", "INFO  I'm confused how people are making judgments because your post is not at all clear.\n\nWhat are the usual arrangements for rent? Is she asking you to pay more than you usually do? Or do you think you should pay less because she's away?", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't have to pay for her poor planning. That said, INFO: you say she always pays you back when you lend her money. Does she plan on paying you back for the rent as well? Is this a \"can you cover me for now?\" Or \"you should pay it because I won't even be here\" situation. You're still 100% in the right, I'm just trying to see from her point of view. I've had to borrow money from SO before too but if she's borrowing money, going on a trip AND doesn't plan on paying you back that rent, she is definitely taking advantage", "YTA for letting yourself be treated like an atm. I was in a relationship like this and I guarantee this is not temporary. She will always be bad with money because she has a financial backup plan, which is you. She is spending money on luxurious things instead of paying rent not because she is bad at managing finances, but because she KNOWS you will suck it up and pay things for her. Its pretty clear that she feels entitled to your money, and is comfortable using you for her own needs. You are just making excuses for her and it pains me to read this because it reminds me of myself with my ex who took everything I did for them for granted. You either need to set a firm boundary with money, or think about your long term goals together. Can you picture your future with someone like her? Who would rather go on a cruise trip than pay for rent/your kids tuition?", "ESH. You complain but still justify your gf's latest extravagance based on a supposed work-hours upgrade that is happening next year. What makes you think she will manage her finances better? I feel you'll give her the loan anyway, regardless of what's said here, so add her share of the rent to what's owed or suck it up.", "Edited as i was shown the error on my way of thinking: NTA but she is using money she doesnt have cause shes borrowing off you, a overseas holiday when she cant even pay for anything going by sounds of it shes a gold digger stoo giving her money and paying for her see how she handles that.", "ESH you're loaning her money for the trip and she wants you to pay full rent as well?\n\nFor something *she's* decided to do?\n\nShe sucks but you *are* enabling her. Stop now, not next year. Cause next year will be something else.", "I think both NTA and ESH.\n\nYou're NTA for the rent dilemma. Your girlfriend can't afford to pay her share, so she shouldn't be going on holiday. That's the reality of adulthood.\n\nI think ESH comes into play because you've fought over money before, and you said, \"she would continue to spend her money on things that weren\u2019t necessities,\" - my guy, you're enabling this behaviour by lending her money. Generosity and helping your girlfriend is one thing, but taking the piss is another. It seems like she's taking advantage of you.
