I remember that was stunned, embarrassed and didn\u2019t know what to do, so I went to my room and cried, not eating dinner. My mom came up later on and defended her, saying \u201cHon she\u2019s just jealous. Don\u2019t let it get to you.\u201d I did. Eventually. It still was humiliating. \n\nThe comments were primarily about my hair, though. For reference, I have curly hair, about a 3C pattern. This was around the time that there wasn\u2019t much information about curly hair, so not only did I not know how to take care of it, I was ashamed of it and always complained that I wanted it straight.

So I glared at her.

I defended myself and basically said \u201cI understand that you\u2019re defending your friend, but these comments are not kind and have never made me feel good.\u201d It ended in a screaming match and I left for work. \nSo AITA?
