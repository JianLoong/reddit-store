Never anything bad or insulting, but the comments didn\u2019t make me feel good either.\n\nWhen I was about 11-12, when I was developing breasts, we were all at the table eating. I stood up to grab something and Marie exclaimed \u201cDANCEDANGEROUS7950 YOURE GETTING BOOBS!!\u201d \n\nEveryone laughed. Except me. I remember that was stunned, embarrassed and didn\u2019t know what to do, so I went to my room and cried, not eating dinner. My mom came up later on and defended her, saying \u201cHon she\u2019s just jealous. Don\u2019t let it get to you.\u201d I did. Eventually. It still was humiliating. \n\nThe comments were primarily about my hair, though. For reference, I have curly hair, about a 3C pattern. This was around the time that there wasn\u2019t much information about curly hair, so not only did I not know how to take care of it, I was ashamed of it and always complained that I wanted it straight. It took me a long time (kindergarten to senior year of HS) to grow to love my hair now and properly care for it.\n\nBetween those awkward stages of hating my hair, Marie\u2019s comments would be \u201cI wish I was able to just roll out of bed without doing my hair\u201d or \u201cYour curls are beautiful, but I want to see it straight one day!\u201d OR, and this one\u2019s my favorite \u201cJust brush your hair, then it\u2019ll look nice!\u201d \n\nAt the time, I just dealt with it, and even if I told her to not touch my hair (that\u2019s an entirely different discussion), my parents would tell me to \u201cbe nice.\u201d\n\nSo, this leads to what happened last night.

So I glared at her. She said \u201cIt\u2019s a compliment I love your hair !\u201d I said \u201cThat\u2019s not a compliment, and *you know that*.\u201d Shortly afterwards I went to bed.\n\nThis morning my mom scolded me and said I was unnecessarily rude to Marie and ruined everyone\u2019s mood. I defended myself and basically said \u201cI understand that you\u2019re defending your friend, but these comments are not kind and have never made me feel good.\u201d It ended in a screaming match and I left for work. \nSo AITA?
