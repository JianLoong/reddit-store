She's trying to gauge your reaction and whether you have already noticed or care. That's why she got annoyed when you didn't laugh at the \"joke\"--the whole thing was a test to see how you would respond. She's being an AH by setting relationship traps for you.  But while no apology is due, I suggest you apologize for the misunderstanding and explain you love her but are confused by her mixed messages.

I just don\u2019t know how to respond when you make comments about your weight, because I know you\u2019re self conscious about it, and I don\u2019t want to say anything that will hurt your feelings.

I agree that we shouldn't do that, but it is causing a whole generation of people to be too comfortable being obese and letting their health go bad.\n\nYou are NTA for offering to walk with her, cook with her, etc. I think that was a nice gesture. She is angry because she knows you are right. I hope she takes you up on your offer. Being obese isn't about aesthetics. It's about the horrible damage she is doing to her body that is going to get harder and harder to overcome as she gets older.", "She wants you to agree with her excuses to NOT do a thing, to tell her it\u2019s fine.

She is still relatively young and it just gets harder.  But until she is ready to commit to a healthier lifestyle \u2026 sadly only negative consequences are in her future.

But at the end of the day, while being fat or skinny is relative, but being healthy or unhealthy is objectively defined. So if she does feel winded, it\u2019s a health concern and not an insult.

If she is 220 now and doesn\u2019t want to change her behaviour despite your support then soon she will be even bigger.

What you said to her was clearly in a helpful way because you\u2019re worried for her.

So she threw it back at you and called you a jerk. To make herself feel better. \n\nObviously her weight isn\u2019t giving her a confidence boost based on her reacting.

But not the _smartest_ either.\n\nIt personally drives me up a wall that people will constantly complain about their weight and then go shocked Pikachu face when you say anything about it. But it's a dynamic that exists and it's hard to believe you reached 25 without encountering it before.\n\nWhen people (SO or otherwise) complain about their weight it's usually easiest to make vague grunts of sympathy.", "NTA. I don't know what people think they're doing when they keep talking like that. Is everybody supposed to ignore it?

Maybe you should tell her that you will love her no matter how she looks and that it isn't about her appearance. You just want her to be well. \n\nAs someone who has always struggled with weight - facing up to it is hard.

Say you want to do this for you  too and you are a team, you will work together to get healthier and reach goals together. \n\nAsk her what her goals and dreams are, and what you can do together to reach them. \n\nMake the focus less about the weight, and more about becoming better, healthier and happier people. \n\nNTA but also slightly an Asshole.", "Being fat is not healthy and the #1 issue in the US.

Doesn\u2019t seem like you were pressuring her or anything, just letting her know you\u2019re there if she chooses to embark on the journey and wants company. I think that\u2019s a very nice thing to offer given how daunting and difficult it is to do on your own. It could also be a nice bonding activity to do together. You didn\u2019t mention looks at all, so you\u2019re definitely not being shallow about it. \n\nI will say on the note of her \u201cflip flopping\u201d, that it\u2019s very common for people who aren\u2019t the typical ideal body shape/weight, especially women, to flip flop on how they feel about their bodies during any given hour. On the one had we\u2019re told to be positive about ourselves; that we should love ourselves for who we are and have confidence in our own skin, and we genuinely want to exude that. But then on the other hand, we have the usual things that make us feel like shit, whether that be media, other people, or even just hormonal changes throughout the month that can leave us feeling insecure. So don\u2019t mind the flip flopping too much. She\u2019s likely being torn between two very opposing mentalities that society wants us all to simultaneously fit into somehow.\n\nLet her come down from her initial feelings and talk to her about it. Explain to her your concerns and that you\u2019re clearly worried because you love her and want her to feel good and get the most out of life. If she comes around then great, and if she doesn\u2019t then it\u2019s on her.", "Nah you're NTA, you're just trying to be supportive. She's just really really insecure. I used to be in her shoes, I would be upset about my weight, then not do anything about it, decide to accept myself, then gain more and be unhappy, and then in my unhappiness lash out at people aroeund me for either not being supportive of me trying to lose weight or being shallow for saying anything that wasn't \"you're beautiful and perfect the way you are\".  It was just me being really profoundly insecure and the emotional issues I had planted themselves firmly in my shitty relationship with food and it was a cycle I just got stuck in for ages until I realized it really was up to me to do something about. You sound like you're being supportive about it and that's the best/most you can really do. She has to take responsibility for both her health and the unhealthy emotions that spring up around/cause her issues with it.", "NTA. I would also take this as a serious health issue if it were someone close to me. \n\nAt this point, I would say she is likely addicted to eating. A lot of addicts flip flop between \"I need to get better\" and \"fuck it\" which is why making progress isn't easy. This is why support is often necessary, even though they may not appreciate it at the time. \n\nI would continue offering support but in subtle ways such as making a nice healthy meal to share, asking to go out on walks because you want to spend time with her and not because of her weight. \"Hey, I found this beach on Google maps. I want to check it out with you.\" Don't make everything about her losing weight because then in her eyes, it seems like you are only criticizing her. Weight gain can be a pretty sensitive topic for most people, especially if it's that drastic.", "NTA She was probably fishing for no youre fine the way your are.  But truth is someone of her comments are concerning.  I think you went about it the right way", "NTA. Sounds like she's caught between a desire to lose weight and feedback from social media telling her that it's fatphobic to think that losing weight makes her healthier. It's a very strange trend.

If she wants to stay the same then that\u2019s her choice. She\u2019s not stupid, she does not need you pointing out that she needs to lose weight.

I have always struggled with my weight. So, I have a soft spot for those who are overweight/obese, because the fight is not pretty. Sometimes it is more of a mental battle then an actual motivation dis-connect.  For me, I struggle with a binge eating issue. I can lose weight, exercise, eat well, the whole nine yards. Then suddenly, perhaps due to stressors in my life, I binge. I put on weight quickly and I start to hide my food, eat in secret, disconnect from social situations and the problem gets worse. \n\nSo, half the battle is knowing who you are, and your particular struggles. With that being said, I don't think anyone could have helped me to get healthier. Yes, friends and family members can be supportive. However, if I didn't tackle my particular demons, or decide to change and become more active and eat healthier meals, no one could guilt me into doing so. No one could love me into being healthy. \n\nThis sort of feels like where your GF is at. She is in the denial stage. It is easier to be where she is nos.

Weight fluxation, mood swings, being winded easily, and her age (among a host of others), strikes me as thyroid. Hashimotos is an autoimmune disease of the thyroid. There are easily over 50 symptoms, but her age and sex are a huge red flag. It takes 10ish years for a burnt out thyroid to show, so if she started gaining weight around puberty, it would make sense she is having issues show up seriously now. I would really encourage her to get a *full* thyroid panel done. If she doesn't get the thyroid antibodies tested, it's useless. So help her advocate, hard. On average it takes women 10 years to get a diagnosis, despite women being more likely than men to get it. \n\nSorry to info dump. I have hashimotos and I wasn't diagnosed until it caused me to have a seizure at 27 and it's shockingly common. I was sick basically from age 13 on, and no one listened. I just got lectured that I was eating poorly. In reality, my thyroid was effed and I ended up incredibly sick. It sounds like you love her and care for her well-being.

This means she is starting to realise and get into admitting it, but hearing it by someone else probably hurts.

I\u2019m sorry to say but her being overweight means you could be in for a miserable relationship of hospital visits, skin sores, diabetes, loss of libido, infertility\u2026 You\u2019re NTA for gently wanting to lead her to better habits (without all-out forcing her to the gym 5x a week and depriving her of food).", "NAH. Shes not an asshole for being insecure but she would be if she punished you for demonstrating you care with such sensitivity. OP please don't give up on her and continue to support healthy changes, you're doing it the right way.", "The way everyone\u2019s bypassing the toxic behavior cause she\u2019s insecure is fuckin nuts lol this testing is manipulative and will only get worse if you let her continue to do it.", "You\u2019ve approached it well and I think you sound like a supportive partner.", "NTA. It sounds like she may be upset by her weight or maybe she wasn\u2019t ready to address it with you.

It seems like she\u2019s making those comments and jokes as a way to cope. She probably wanted reassurance that you still like her. You are seeing the concerning sign of her not being able to walk very far and you\u2019re worried about her health. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call them red flags and I\u2019d honestly ignore the pants thing. It\u2019s really about her health and not her actual size label. But it sounds like she\u2019s not ready to make a change, so any comments about helping her are going to feel accusatory and like you think she\u2019s fat and needs to lose weight. Speaking from personal experience on that one. \n\nI would instead encourage her to see her doctor for a physical if she hasn\u2019t had one. See what all her numbers look like and what her doctor says. \n\nIf she\u2019s not in therapy, she can also consider that too. It may be helpful to her for her own body image and lifestyle. \n\nIn the meantime, I\u2019d do subtle things without even mentioning it. For example, my metro parks always do a winter hike challenge that\u2019s fairly easy and fun. It\u2019s about going to the different parks, finding items, getting a stamp, etc\u2026 something like that could be a great way for her to get outside and enjoy herself while also being a nice bonding time for you as a couple.", "NAH.

Unfortunately, I don't really think you can help her until she decides to help herself. Before then, try suggesting healthy meals when you eat together and invite her to go on walks. It'll probably be obvious what you're trying to do, but if she really wants to change, she'll be grateful as long as you don't say anything outright.

While my weight initially went up for gaining muscle it\u2019s starting to go back down. \n\nShe needs to draw the line herself and while you\u2019re looking out for her best interests it seems she doesn\u2019t care. \n\nMe and my partner agreed at the beginning of our relationship that neither of us are allowed to get fat and do nothing about it. It might sound shallow but sexual attraction is important along with wanting to live a long healthy life.", "I\u2019m gonna be honest, if any of my friends/partners/loved ones complained about getting breathless from walking around the block, I\u2019d start a conversation.

I went through some similar things with my mom. She would always talk about how overweight she was and go through bursts of working out and insulting herself when doing so.. it was hard to watch and I never got the courage to try and help her.\n\nYour girlfriend is obviously vulnerable and you expressing your concerns was prohably what she needed to hear.. but not what she wanted to if that makes sense. I would personally ask her what she wants to do and offer a couple ideas you think could work. She could even build her way up to joining you at the gym!", "NTA. I am there now. I used to weigh over 340 lbs... that's where my scale stopped. I used to make these jokes because I hated myself and couldn't see why it would be worth putting in the effort to get better.

He was going to the gym every day, sometimes twice a day. He lost so much weight rapidly that the government paid for him to get a tummy tuck. He would crack jokes about his own weight when he was bigger, but then started commenting about my weight and getting me into the gym with him. Then the jokes about my weight started. I held on to him because I didn't think anyone else would tolerate me. \n\nWhen he dumped me (something he did frequently) after I had spent my time and money caring for him when he almost died right after his surgery and had driven him over an hour back to his town after he was released from the hospital, I let it go and didn't let him try to get with me again. I finally realized I deserved better.\n\nShe's lucky to have your support. I managed to get down to 250 lbs and have never gone higher than 280 since, but I did it alone.

I don't think she's flip flopping or changing her mind about it but I understand why it might seem like that.\n\n\n\nHonestly my bet would be that she does want to lose weight and is insecure, but it's also hard and she might not know where to start. She probably makes the jokes so nobody else will or as a different kind of coping mechanism, maybe hoping you'll reassure her you find her beautiful. \n\n  \nTake some time to think about if you're compatible because it will most likely be years of trying to lose weight, giving up, trying again etc because that's how it usually goes.", "This is a great response.

You can't take good care of a thing you hate.\" \n\nNot that everything she says or writes is pure gold, but this quote has stayed with me for YEARS.", "I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d and ~115 or so, and I could not imagine carrying around an extra 100lbs. I\u2019d feel awful all of the time. I think his response was appropriate, NTA.", "I'm also 5'10\" and noticed an increase in my RA pain when I got to 200 pounds. I'm down to about 180 now, but I know thaty knees and feet will feel better at a lower weight.", "I agree with this.  There\u2019s a lot of shame in being overweight in todays society.  It\u2019s not surprising that people can be in denial.  She was seeking validation.", "Nobody hates fat people more than former fat people, and I say this as a former fat person.", "The \"woah!\" as if no one has ever been obese before and the exclamation point emphasizing the surprise. A statement of fact would be: \"That's medically considered obese.\"", "A factual acknowledgment with double exclamation points\u2014and acknowledging a very obvious fact, at that. We love to hate fat people.", "right now, she( along with a couple friends) is trying to put this happy spin of, \" I'm not fat, I'm thicc. I got a thicc ass that I love\"", "That\u2019s not the impression I got. I think he loves her and wants her to live past 50", "Saying that a person is obese is not hating them.", "Complaining about double exclamation points\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s next? That hyphen is a micro-aggression?", "This is a good attitude BUT she has shown signs that she doesn't like her image and this could be just denial, it could lead to serious insecurities. Also if she's worried about her health she could get a check up to see if everything is alright (depends the country, I know that in some countries it costs a fortune).", "I mean that\u2019s my impression. As you can see from my second comment it\u2019s not about him wanting her to live. SHE HAS TO WANT TO for herself. Like are you dense? Can you read", "I think it's denial to be honest", "It isn\u2019t a good attitude. It\u2019s blatant denial", "It was a little hard to follow. Your grammar is awful. The first sentence is quite the run on. I was assuming you\u2019re a non-native English speaker so I didn\u2019t want to say anything. But you brought it up. I would recommend this - Strunk and White, Elements of Style.", "Maybe those friends of hers have been telling them that she's fine and she doesn't need to change anything? Sometimes there are influences like this and that's why she's been changing her mind so much", "**Imo to throw a comparison in here, it would be like if someone had cancer and opted out of chemo** not you trying to throw shade at my grammar bc you\u2019re illiterate. What part of this is hard to follow? Should I dumb it down for you. No worries, you love your family right and want them to live. Well if they have a disease that could kill them called cancer there is an option of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy helps people with cancer but it can make you really sick and depressed and there isnt a guarantee that it works. Your family member may opt out of this treatment and choose to die by natures course. That is their choice, not one that you can make for them. Of course you want them to live but if they don\u2019t want to go through this process they *shouldn\u2019t be forced to or told to by you* Is that better for you? Do you get it now. Jesus lmfao and you know damn well I\u2019m not a non-native speaker you\u2019re just trying to bring me down a peg. Sorry love that doesn\u2019t work on me I have a superiority complex when it comes to the English language", "i believe so. It would really make sense since some of these friends have put on a bit of weight themselves recently", "Well that's rough buddy, you could try and ask her what she really wants but it could misinterpreted that you care about her looks and not her wellbeing. You could point out that she seems to be going back and forth with the matter and that's why you're having this talk and basically talk to her in a way you know that she won't misinterpret."]}
