Those social security cheques exist for a very specific purpose: to replace the income your father would have brought in and used for your care, as your parent. That's why they were sent to your mum while you were underage, because they were meant for her to use to provide life essentials for you - food, shelter, etc.\n\nNow that you're 18, yes, the money goes directly to you. But that's only because as a legal adult it is assumed that you will be paying your own bills and need the money to help take care of yourself. If your mother is still de facto \"taking care of you\" - if you are living in her home, not paying rent, and she is providing your food, paying the bills, etc. - then the entire amount of the cheque should still be given to her. The fact that she's willing to compromise shows that she's thoughtful and how much she loves you. \n\nRight now, you want to keep all the money meant to be used to pay your bills, and still have her pay for all of those things. Your selfishness is shocking. You have a lot of growing up to do. YTA.", "YTA \n\nWant it all for yourself? Cool! Then move out and pay for everything for yourself by yourself.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t been \u201ctaking your money for years\u201d. She has been getting a government benefit to raise a child. Her child, her money.\n\nYou are feeling bad about it because this is a selfish, childish, absolute dick move.", "Like others have said, you're misinterpreting what SS is for. '[Benefits for children](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10085.pdf)' go to a parent/guardian for a surviving child's support so they can complete their education. That's why payment stops at 18 (aka when you are no longer a minor and therefore your guardian is no longer legally required to support you), but can continue to 19 if on the 18th birthday the child hasn't yet graduated high school, but is still enrolled in school. This type of benefit is explicitly supposed to go to guardians for supporting minors while they complete their education/disabled adults who still live at home and cannot provide for themselves. It is not at all inappropriate for your mom to have used this money for your support. I'd read up on it and apologize if I were you.", "YTA.

You are an adult, and you are not entitled to have all those things for free.", "YTA - if you are living with your mom and she is taking care of you, the purpose of the money is to feed and care for you, not so you can go shopping and have fun.   Your mom should just start charging you rent.", "YTA\n\nThat money is to cover your housing, food, clothing, etc.  \n\nUnless you are moving out and paying rent and food elsewhere, you need to contribute most of it to the household for room and board.  \n\nThink of it as \u201cchild support\u201c from the government since your father isn\u2019t here to pay it.  Child support is literally for the support of the child, to cover expenses related to raising the child.   Room and board, clothing and educational expenses.", "I agree it's your money, but at the same time if you want to \"keep it all\" (or most of it), make sure to pay your rent or pay your part since you live at her place and you're not a minor, so she won't have anything to say. Make a fair budget with all the expenses you have and all the expenses she does to cover your needs. If you pay your part, nobody has anything to say.

A portion of that should cover the cost of your living expenses and go to your mom.", "YTA\n\nAssuming your father left your surviving mother everything, your fathers' social security checks belonged to her until you turned 18.  You are incorrect to say \"she has been stealing your money\".\n\nThat being said, you ARE correct to suggest that the money sent to you AFTER you turn 18 is yours.  [The only way you would be receiving this money is if you are not yet 19 and still attending high school, or are permanently disabled](https://www.investopedia.com/can-adult-child-collect-parent-social-security-benefits-5221671).  If one of these two is not true, your mother is committing social security fraud. \n\nAssuming you are supposed to be receiving this money, you would be within your rights to keep it all, but you would still be the asshole because you are not willing to contribute to a household where you are causing expenses.  You should be willing to part with SOME percentage of that money IMO, even if it is 10% or something.", "YTA that money paid your living expenses. Now that you are an adult, you should be paying rent, food bills and utilities to your mom.", "YTA - If you are living with mom rent-free, she should get the money. All of it. But she's offering to split it with you after she did the legwork of getting the money to continue. This is meant to replace a parent's financial support in their absence. It's not a consolation prize for losing a parent.", "YTA\n\nSocial security checks in most countries - given after the death of a parent - are to support the whole family with the loss of one of the adult earners - given per child but to the parent. That it continues after 18 is a bonus but unless you are no longer living at home and getting supported by your mother then you should be giving her, at the very least, some of the money.", "YTA: you don\u2019t know that it won\u2019t make a difference. Unless it\u2019s like, $20, or very much could. An extra $100 a month can mean the difference between keeping the lights on and not. \n\nIt would have been nice for your mother to put money away for you all this time from those cheques but clearly she hasn\u2019t been able to afford to do that. Since you\u2019re turning 18, should she start charging you rent? I think she\u2019s being generous by not wanting all of it. Whatever percentage she wants from it, you should give it to her. Think of it like rent. A room in a house where I live is $500-$700 a month.", "YTA.  That money was meant to provide you with some financial to replace the support you would have gotten from your father.  If you continue to live at home, it will continue to cost your mother money to house and feed you.", "YTA. It is not YOUR money. It is hers to raise you. When you turn 18, and it becomes yours, PULL YOUR WEIGHT and help your mom out.", "YTA\n\nThe money did go to help you.  She spent it on food, clothes, utilities, mortgage/rent, etc.  All for your benefit, and your siblings' benefit.    \n\nIf you don't want to continue to live there, sure.  Keep the money, but she's not obligated to house you after 18.  She can start charging you rent.  You should contribute in some way.  It's only fair to her.\n\nShe is losing an income that she counts on to support you.  She'll get by better if you contribute a small amount or buy your own food and clothing.  She'll get by better if she doesn't still have to support you.  She it's not obligated and you should be thankful she's allowing you to stay.  \n\nI love my kids, but at 18 if they're not off to college, they're paying rent and contributing to chores or they're not staying.  I'm not raising freeloaders.  They need to learn to be responsible for themselves.  With only one parent, that's even worse.  If you can't stand on your own two feet, what happens to you if something happens to her?\n\nI get it.  You're young and don't fully see the whole picture.  You are correct that is your money, but your mother needs your contribution after 18.  There's no way around it.  You're taking money from her that covers food and bills.  That money was technically yours, but in the same fashion that child support is a child's.  If it goes towards bringing you up, it's used appropriately.  \n\nYou said:\n\n>I can admit we\u2019re not the richest family but we\u2019ll survive without it, it won\u2019t make that much of an impact or change anyways. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being selfish, but I am starting to feel bad about it.\n\nYou ARE actually being selfish here.  \n\nShe lost your father, too.  That's a second income and the costs that those payments covered. She also has more expenses as a single mom because she usually has to pay for childcare if she needs to go literally anywhere or do anything that she can't take you to.  Work, doctor appointments, any other matters she needed to attend to, etc. Not just social outings, but those usually get pushed aside anyway when you're struggling. She did that for years using that money.  You're taking that from her and she's not asking for much in return.  You act like she should have been giving that to you as an allowance.  It's not the same thing, so you can't compare it like it is.  It's probably the only reason you were able to get by. It's not something she stole from you.\n\nMy mother actually did steal from me.  My wealthy uncle sent checks every for our birthdays and Christmas.  She set up accounts and made deposits we weren't allowed to touch it and rarely got an actual gift although that's what it was for.  Then when my sister wanted to go to a fancy boarding school, my mom used all my sister's and my money to pay for it.  I went to public school.  That is an example of theft.  That's what is wrong with parents managing a child's money.  What happened to you isn't even close.", "INFO: are you living with her?  How much does she want?", "No, you and your siblings didn't get the social money. Money was for your mom, so she can raise you, pay food for her kids, clothes etc. That is why at 18 would stop, because you could work or something and she doesn't need to feed you anymore. Somehow she maneged to continue that money support, and you think it all belongs to you now?

Or will you be completely on your own financially?\n\nIf you aren't dependent on your mom financially - then the money is yours. Otherwise you owe her the money.", "NAH as long as she really has been using the money for bills and food. Your father was the breadwinner, it seems. We\u2019re in a difficult time where more than two incomes are necessary to maintain the standard of living we\u2019re used to, and without him she\u2019s probably struggling. Your money now that you\u2019re 18 isn\u2019t just for you to go blow, they do that to pay for school expenses, and other things you need.", "I honestly don't think anyone is going to understand this unless they receive Social Security themselves and why it's important. \n\nYou're basically getting survivors benefits. That means for anyone who doesn't know is that a child can receive those benefits until 18,  still in school, have a disability before 22 or they remain unmarried. \n\nI honestly think you should call Social Security and ask questions about it to be on the safe side.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Benefits end at 18 or upon completing high-school up to 19 which ever happens last.\n\nAs a teen I was upset because I felt my mom was benefitting from my dad's death so I understand where you're coming from. However, once I was the one getting the benefits for my child it all made sense...the perspective changes. That money is money you never would have seen in it's cash form if he hadn't died, you'd have seen it in utility bills being paid, food on the table and a roof over your head.  It isn't a perk or bonus to having a dead spouse it's the government's way of making sure your mom is still able to provide electricity and food and a roof up to the time when you are old enough to legally support yourself..just as your dad would have been responsible for.", "I guess it's time for Mom to charge OP 'rent' once they turned 18", "INFO: When you turn 18, who do you think should cover your expenses? i.e Power, water, gas, phone, internet, food, rent/mortgage, transport... How much do you think all of that costs?", "My mom got money sent to her when her dad died. I don\u2019t know why though", "YTA and you are exhibiting astounding lack of self-awareness and selfishness. Your mom should kick you out when you turn 18 and see how you handle being an adult responsible for everything.", "Then you shouldn't expect your mom to pay for your food and other expenses", "Then you need to start paying for rent, groceries, utilities, and clothing as that\u2019s what that money is for.", "I received child support for one of my children, and it went to bills and food. A few years before the support ended I got a raise that was basically the same amount of money, so I started depositing the child support money in a separate savings account. \n\nAnd then I used it to take a vacation, because it just meant I was using all of my own money on kid expenses. (Which includes family vacations and his first car, before anyone gets mad.)\n\nChild support and SSI are not supposed to be a windfall earmarked for the kid, they are literally to assist with the expenses incurred in caring for them. \n\nIf a parent wants to set the money aside for the kids because they don't need the extra income, that's fine, but it's no different than any parent saving any portion of their own income for their children.", "What does this have to do with Social Security?", "No, you need to grow up because you apparently cannot have an adult conversation or realize what their response actually meant.\n\nThe government response is a conditioned one that assumed you **could** be on your own at 18, and are technically emancipated at 18.\n\nThis means they day you turn 18, mom **could** start charging you for room and board, or **could** kick you to the curb with a bag of clothes and a wave. **This** is why it is in your \u201cbest interest\u201d, if it didn\u2019t flip to you, mom could legally kick you and, and then ALSO keep the checks\u2026.\n\nShe isn\u2019t kicking you to the curb, correct? **Then sign over the check for the household expenses, exactly what it was used for a month before.**", "I do not know my family's expenses either. I'm turning 24 soon and my parents never disclosed it to me. \n\nPoint is refusing to disclose family's expenses does not necessarily make someone in the wrong. \n\nHowever, imo, OP is TA. That money is for the family to be supported. They are expecting to have their cake and eat it too.", "they haven't said that they don't know, they've purposely ignored responding to any questions about it, which is what i'm taking issue with. and they still haven't said how much the check is or detailed what they currently contribute (which they would know) or what they plan to contribute (which they would also know)."]}
