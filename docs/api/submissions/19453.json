Those social security cheques exist for a very specific purpose: to replace the income your father would have brought in and used for your care, as your parent. That's why they were sent to your mum while you were underage, because they were meant for her to use to provide life essentials for you - food, shelter, etc.\n\nNow that you're 18, yes, the money goes directly to you. But that's only because as a legal adult it is assumed that you will be paying your own bills and need the money to help take care of yourself. If your mother is still de facto \"taking care of you\" - if you are living in her home, not paying rent, and she is providing your food, paying the bills, etc. - then the entire amount of the cheque should still be given to her. The fact that she's willing to compromise shows that she's thoughtful and how much she loves you. \n\nRight now, you want to keep all the money meant to be used to pay your bills, and still have her pay for all of those things. Your selfishness is shocking. You have a lot of growing up to do. YTA.", "YTA \n\nWant it all for yourself? Cool! Then move out and pay for everything for yourself by yourself.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t been \u201ctaking your money for years\u201d. She has been getting a government benefit to raise a child. Her child, her money.\n\nYou are feeling bad about it because this is a selfish, childish, absolute dick move.", "Like others have said, you're misinterpreting what SS is for. '[Benefits for children](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10085.pdf)' go to a parent/guardian for a surviving child's support so they can complete their education. That's why payment stops at 18 (aka when you are no longer a minor and therefore your guardian is no longer legally required to support you), but can continue to 19 if on the 18th birthday the child hasn't yet graduated high school, but is still enrolled in school. This type of benefit is explicitly supposed to go to guardians for supporting minors while they complete their education/disabled adults who still live at home and cannot provide for themselves. It is not at all inappropriate for your mom to have used this money for your support. I'd read up on it and apologize if I were you.", "YTA.

You are an adult, and you are not entitled to have all those things for free.", "YTA - if you are living with your mom and she is taking care of you, the purpose of the money is to feed and care for you, not so you can go shopping and have fun.   Your mom should just start charging you rent.", "YTA\n\nThat money is to cover your housing, food, clothing, etc.  \n\nUnless you are moving out and paying rent and food elsewhere, you need to contribute most of it to the household for room and board.  \n\nThink of it as \u201cchild support\u201c from the government since your father isn\u2019t here to pay it.  Child support is literally for the support of the child, to cover expenses related to raising the child.   Room and board, clothing and educational expenses.", "I agree it's your money, but at the same time if you want to \"keep it all\" (or most of it), make sure to pay your rent or pay your part since you live at her place and you're not a minor, so she won't have anything to say. Make a fair budget with all the expenses you have and all the expenses she does to cover your needs. If you pay your part, nobody has anything to say.

A portion of that should cover the cost of your living expenses and go to your mom.", "YTA\n\nAssuming your father left your surviving mother everything, your fathers' social security checks belonged to her until you turned 18.  You are incorrect to say \"she has been stealing your money\".\n\nThat being said, you ARE correct to suggest that the money sent to you AFTER you turn 18 is yours.  [The only way you would be receiving this money is if you are not yet 19 and still attending high school, or are permanently disabled](https://www.investopedia.com/can-adult-child-collect-parent-social-security-benefits-5221671).  If one of these two is not true, your mother is committing social security fraud. \n\nAssuming you are supposed to be receiving this money, you would be within your rights to keep it all, but you would still be the asshole because you are not willing to contribute to a household where you are causing expenses.  You should be willing to part with SOME percentage of that money IMO, even if it is 10% or something.", "YTA that money paid your living expenses. Now that you are an adult, you should be paying rent, food bills and utilities to your mom.", "YTA - If you are living with mom rent-free, she should get the money. All of it. But she's offering to split it with you after she did the legwork of getting the money to continue. This is meant to replace a parent's financial support in their absence. It's not a consolation prize for losing a parent.", "YTA\n\nSocial security checks in most countries - given after the death of a parent - are to support the whole family with the loss of one of the adult earners - given per child but to the parent. That it continues after 18 is a bonus but unless you are no longer living at home and getting supported by your mother then you should be giving her, at the very least, some of the money.", "YTA: you don\u2019t know that it won\u2019t make a difference. Unless it\u2019s like, $20, or very much could. An extra $100 a month can mean the difference between keeping the lights on and not. \n\nIt would have been nice for your mother to put money away for you all this time from those cheques but clearly she hasn\u2019t been able to afford to do that. Since you\u2019re turning 18, should she start charging you rent? I think she\u2019s being generous by not wanting all of it. Whatever percentage she wants from it, you should give it to her. Think of it like rent. A room in a house where I live is $500-$700 a month.", "YTA.  That money was meant to provide you with some financial to replace the support you would have gotten from your father.  If you continue to live at home, it will continue to cost your mother money to house and feed you.", "YTA. It is not YOUR money. It is hers to raise you. When you turn 18, and it becomes yours, PULL YOUR WEIGHT and help your mom out.", "YTA\n\nThe money did go to help you.  She spent it on food, clothes, utilities, mortgage/rent, etc.  All for your benefit, and your siblings' benefit.    \n\nIf you don't want to continue to live there, sure.  Keep the money, but she's not obligated to house you after 18.  She can start charging you rent.  You should contribute in some way.  It's only fair to her.\n\nShe is losing an income that she counts on to support you.  She'll get by better if you contribute a small amount or buy your own food and clothing.  She'll get by better if she doesn't still have to support you.  She it's not obligated and you should be thankful she's allowing you to stay.  \n\nI love my kids, but at 18 if they're not off to college, they're paying rent and contributing to chores or they're not staying.  I'm not raising freeloaders.  They need to learn to be responsible for themselves.  With only one parent, that's even worse.  If you can't stand on your own two feet, what happens to you if something happens to her?\n\nI get it.  You're young and don't fully see the whole picture.  You are correct that is your money, but your mother needs your contribution after 18.  There's no way around it.  You're taking money from her that covers food and bills.  That money was technically yours, but in the same fashion that child support is a child's.  If it goes towards bringing you up, it's used appropriately.  \n\nYou said:\n\n>I can admit we\u2019re not the richest family but we\u2019ll survive without it, it won\u2019t make that much of an impact or change anyways. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being selfish, but I am starting to feel bad about it.\n\nYou ARE actually being selfish here.  \n\nShe lost your father, too.  That's a second income and the costs that those payments covered. She also has more expenses as a single mom because she usually has to pay for childcare if she needs to go literally anywhere or do anything that she can't take you to.  Work, doctor appointments, any other matters she needed to attend to, etc. Not just social outings, but those usually get pushed aside anyway when you're struggling. She did that for years using that money.  You're taking that from her and she's not asking for much in return.  You act like she should have been giving that to you as an allowance.  It's not the same thing, so you can't compare it like it is.  It's probably the only reason you were able to get by. It's not something she stole from you.\n\nMy mother actually did steal from me.  My wealthy uncle sent checks every for our birthdays and Christmas.  She set up accounts and made deposits we weren't allowed to touch it and rarely got an actual gift although that's what it was for.  Then when my sister wanted to go to a fancy boarding school, my mom used all my sister's and my money to pay for it.  I went to public school.  That is an example of theft.  That's what is wrong with parents managing a child's money.  What happened to you isn't even close.", "INFO: are you living with her?  How much does she want?", "No, you and your siblings didn't get the social money. Money was for your mom, so she can raise you, pay food for her kids, clothes etc. That is why at 18 would stop, because you could work or something and she doesn't need to feed you anymore. Somehow she maneged to continue that money support, and you think it all belongs to you now?

Or will you be completely on your own financially?\n\nIf you aren't dependent on your mom financially - then the money is yours. Otherwise you owe her the money.", "NAH as long as she really has been using the money for bills and food. Your father was the breadwinner, it seems. We\u2019re in a difficult time where more than two incomes are necessary to maintain the standard of living we\u2019re used to, and without him she\u2019s probably struggling. Your money now that you\u2019re 18 isn\u2019t just for you to go blow, they do that to pay for school expenses, and other things you need.", "I honestly don't think anyone is going to understand this unless they receive Social Security themselves and why it's important. \n\nYou're basically getting survivors benefits. That means for anyone who doesn't know is that a child can receive those benefits until 18,  still in school, have a disability before 22 or they remain unmarried. \n\nI honestly think you should call Social Security and ask questions about it to be on the safe side.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't recall ever having ss money being sent to me when my dad passed, even after I turned 18.", "Thank you for asking the teen this. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udd6f\ufe0f\ud83d\udc97 it is very likely that mom has insulated all the kids from the reality of things like that, to give them grieving space.  \nI really hope OP sees this and asks their mom to lay it out. OP is a good age to be learning the realities of how much living costs.", "you have exactly zero idea what you're talking about. your take is absurd.", "Wow you made a whole story up. \n\nThe benefit is to help support the children. It\u2019s not her money. It\u2019s for her sustenance which is what her mum has been using it for.", "It's not a scam. Likely OP is still in school in which case the benefit will be provided until 22.", "u/Carpefelem posted a good explanation of the Social Security Benefits for Children [here](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14601bq/_/jnnsqah/?context=1).", "I did because I didnt graduate for a few months after I turned 18 (Sept baby). As soon as I graduated that May the checks ended. Someone told me they got them through college, but I haven't done research to see if that is true.", "In the US if your parents paid into social security and they pass away that money should go to minor children.", "It\u2019s a survivor benefit intended for children.  The only reason it\u2019s being still paid after turning 18 is because OP is still in high school.", "My ex husband and his sister both criticized their mother for collecting his social security benefits, but she did that to pay the bills and put food in their bellies.  They struggled hard, but she did keep them fed and clothed and they turned into halfway decent people.  My ex sorta got it and understood after talking to me, but his sister still holds it against her.  She also did get to see some of that in the form of a car that she soon after wrapped around a pole while driving drunk.  She said that didn't count because she didn't get a replacement car. Yeah, I don't think she deserved a replacement either.", "Mom keeping the money sounds scammy to me.", "I\u2019ve never seen it go beyond high school (my sister got it for her 3 kids when my brother-in-law died).  It ended when the turned 18 or graduated from high school (whichever came later).", "Or it could be that she's been a sole carer for multiple children solo and the money has been used for paying bills and is now going to have to fund OP's portion herself while OP keeps all the benefit money and offers nothing to contribute to the cost of living there.", "She used it for bills and expenses to take care of the children. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for. What\u2019s scammy about that?", "If the government is writing the check to the kid, it\u2019s the kids check. I left home at 18 and never went back so clearly my opinion is colored by my own experience.", "YTA. She hasn\u2019t been \u201ctaking your money for years and not giving you any of it.\u201d She clearly has been using it to provide for you.", "YTA.  She's put a roof over your head, paid utilities, put food on the table.  That's what the money is for.", "YTA - Your mom hasn't been buying sports cars or going on gambling junkets with the the money. She has been making sure you are fed, housed, and clothed. You didn't say how many siblings you have or if your mom also works. Life is expensive these days.", "YTA that money was paid to your parent to help provide for you. I\u2019m assuming you live with her and she pays all your bills which is what it\u2019s meant to go towards.", "YTA It\u2019s not your money, it\u2019s for your support. If you want to keep it all, move out. Then maybe you\u2019ll understand the costs your mother has had to manage if she had no support.", "Oooooo baby. It\u2019s time for you to start googling to learn about SS and cost of living. Be grateful your mom used it for bills. YTA but because of lack of information. Sit down with your mom, maybe she\u2019ll break everything down to you about how this money provided for you and still does, because I\u2019m sure you\u2019re still under her roof.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI was in this exact situation, verbatim. I had this same argument with my mom, but I didn\u2019t truly understand what the money was for. I googled it a few days later and apologized. That money is money from the government to help her raise you and pay bills. Think of it as the income your father would be bringing in if he were here. It is meant for her to use on your living expenses, even though it is technically going to you now. I bet she was able to get around it because you still live with her- that\u2019s how my mom did. If you can, apologize and let her know you didn\u2019t understand. Also, stay well- I know how triggering these situations can be\u2764\ufe0fAlso, some of these commenters are being unnecessarily harsh. Don\u2019t take it personally.", "Me too.", "Your mom should allow you to keep the full amount\u2026if you move out and pay fully for yourself\u2026deal??? YTA, you are very out of touch.", "Have you every heard of rent? YTA if you want it all to yourself, move out", "YTA.\n\nAs others have said, that money is intended to support you in the complete financial absence of your father.  That includes money that your mother put forward in anticipation of a future support check.  \n\nAs an example, in my family, if I passed away as the primary earner, my SO would be forced to spend some of their money immediately in order to preserve housing and utilities.  They would lose earning power because there is no balance of who calls off when kids are sick or have a long weekend.  That loss is supported with survivor benefits.", "YTA", "It's wasn't money for you to blow on clothes and fun. It was meant to keep you fed and a roof over your head. If you live at home after 18 it's fair you help pay some bills and rent. Don't like that,move out. The real world sucks.  YTA", "YTA.\n\nHow dare she spend on frivolous thinks like food!\n\nGive your head a shake, kid. Or move out and do it all on your own. Go for it.", "YTA i had a similar situation dad didnt pass but got injured and was getting benifits i thought similarly as u till i found out we were 1 missed payment from being evicted. First thing i did was pay all the bills", "NTA, and sue her for the full amount of YOUR money that she STOLE from you.", "I\u2019m not going to judge you either way but I also got benefits for my fathers death. I gave them to my mom after I turned 18 because it was how we paid rent. \n\nIt\u2019s a personal decision but if she has always paid for you and treated you fairly maybe just do the same for her ?", "you\u2019re not. that money should\u2019ve been squared away for you to carry out your future for whenever you came of age. it was under your name, she did not have a right to it.", "Yta \n\nI lost my dad at 16, 31 now. My mom received money up until my graduation. I didn\u2019t even think about taking it from her. Instead, I got a job. \n\nIf you want the measly check, you are free to move out. Have fun finding a place to rent, pay for your bills, food, and anything else you want.", "YTA. You\u2019re over 18, an adult. You need to contribute towards rent, food, utilities, and all the things your mother does to make your life comfortable.", "You don't have to give her any money. You can move out! No judgement, but that's where you are headed.", "YTA life ain\u2019t free kid.", "YTA - that money wasn't ever your money - it was intended to go to your mom to help pay for your expenses, since your dad could not longer contribute.  Your mom has to provide an itemization of what she used that money for each year. I was in that situation and trust me, it wasn't fun money - If you are still living in your mom's house once you turn 18 until you graduate,  that money should go to her, unless you plan on paying your portion of rent, utilities,food, plus all your clothing,  medical costs, school supplies, etc. \n\nYTA", "You want all the money? Move out", "YTA and a selfish brat. How do you think your mother kept your family afloat for years?", "I'm going against the grain, NTA. \n\nThat money is being issued to you because of your father's passing. Most parents would take that money and start setting it aside for college education and your expenses as you enter into adulthood. You were underage, that money was being taken from you. So mommy could pay the bills. Why couldn't mom handle paying the bills on her own? \n\nThe money you'll be getting when you're eighteen is your money. You are entitled to the full amount based on federal law. If your mom desperately needs that money that much, then she needs to start looking at her expenses and way of life. Is she gonna help you when you do want to go off to college? Is she gonna pay that with that social security money? I doubt it.", "NTA-as long as you are in school you can collect SS benefits three months over the ago of 19. It\u2019s YOUR money! Put it away and save it for college! Your moms poor spending/saving are not your problem! Let her deal with the fallout! If you\u2019d like you could give her a few bucks if you\u2019re still going to be living with her after the age of 18. Till then pocket the rest in an account that she absolutely cannot touch! Good luck!", "NTAH i know how it feels to have your mom take from you only real difference is my mom took money that was meant for me gave me $50 a month and gave the rest to my brother i\u2019m now 36 and she doesn\u2019t ask. She was still taking after i left home with my daughter", "Even then, they\u2019re inly still being issue because OP hasn\u2019t graduated high school yet.  The checks will need when they graduate.", "Never said it was fun money. Never specifically stated what I planned on spending it on in the first place.", "Totally!  This is the same as kids feeling child support checks should go to them to be used at their whim!", "Agree. YTA here and you need to check that your mom didn\u2019t do something illegal by falsifying information to have this go beyond 18! Feel free to live on your own I\u2019d you want to keep it all, but if she committed benefits fraud and you are collecting the checks, you can be charged as well.", "Giving her the money wouldn't really \"rent-free\" though.", "If the money was meant to replace that parents financial support, then the money would be issued directly to the parent, not the child. That money should be set aside for the child's education.", "That you were planning to spend it on something in the first place is the issue. Only exception would've been if you intend to give it to your mum.", "So, what are you planning on spending it on? Isn't giving your mom some of it for rent and food the same as if you were moving out and paying (likely way more) for rent and food elsewhere?\n\nYou've misunderstood what that money is for and why your mother was getting them. It was never yours, and its only yours now because your mom made sure you would get it, because your entire family needs it.", "Your mother is 100% correct.\n\nThat money is to replace your father's income so she can feed and house and support you.\n\nWhich she's doing.\n\nThere's no reason for it to be spent any differently. It's not supposed to be spent any differently.", "Well you aren't planning on spending it on the bills because you think you should keep it", "As long as they are a student, survivor benefits can be paid, until their 19th birthday.

I had mostly been a stay at home mother who started working part time in retail a few months before he passed. I was also fortunate that my late husband's job kept us on the medical plan for three years after he passed, so I am guessing that the OP's mother might have to pay for a medical plan on behalf of her daughter.", "Some people don\u2019t have that privilege.", "A very long time ago (when I was in college), if your parent was retired you could get SS benefits during your college years.", "It should go to provide SUPPORT for the minor children.
