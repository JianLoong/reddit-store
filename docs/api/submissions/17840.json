Together 4 years. \n\nPersonally I didn't want the child, my work was offering potential advances within my position and I was excited for it. But after alot of talking, we decided to go forward with it. \n\n\nWhen I was around 20 weeks (just after finding out the gender) he disappeared. I couldn't contact him, he wouldn't answer the phone or messages. I got worried and messaged his mother and found out he was living back with her and was overwhelmed with the situation. He kept paying his part of the bills over to my bank each month, but I received no contact. I even tried going over, nothing. \n\n\nBy about 27 weeks I gave up trying, gave up crying and just got on with what I thought was a future as a single mother. I brought everything needed over the next couple of weeks and set it all up. \n\n\nAt 31 weeks I started having pains, but put it down to braxton hicks. Just before 32 weeks my waters went and I went into labour, with the baby coming very quickly. He went straight to NICU. I messaged and rang my ex and his mother, no response. \n\n\nLess than a week later, my son passed due to complications of early birth. I again tried to contact my ex and his mother. Left voicemails and messages. Nothing \n\n\nThe next few weeks were a blur, but with the help of my mother and father his funeral was arranged. They tried to contact ex and his mother also, still nothing. I sent more messages, nothing. I'm assuming we were probably all blocked but honestly at that point I didn't care. I was so broken. \n\n\nHis funeral came and went. It was beautiful and horrible. I stopped messaging and told my family not to bother after the funeral had passed. I couldn't deal with it any more.\n\n\nAbout 5 months after his birth/death my ex turned up. Let himself in. \nI wasn't at home, but when I got back he was instantly hostile. The flat was clearly not set up for nor accommodating a small child. \n\nHe demanded to see his son. I broke down and told him what happened. I have never seen him so sad and angry. He stormed out, slamming the door on his way out.\n\n\nWithin half an hour I got a nasty call from his mother, followed by messages from siblings/other family. How dare I not let them know something so serious. How could I hide something like that out of petty spite. \n\n\nI truly didn't, I tried. But I couldn't keep trying. It's been nearly 3 weeks now of them being awful. I was speaking to my sister this weekend and she said \"tbf, it was a bit of a dick move to not keep trying. They deserved to know\" \n\n\nWas it? I tried so hard to let him know, but I was struggling so hard too. I lost my son too. AITA? should I have done more??\n\n\nEdit - thank you all so much for your responses. Sorry for not replying to any. Reading them has been alot. \n\nHonestly, I'm going to drink a bottle of wine (or two), read your kind responses and cry myself to sleep. Writing this all out and living it again has been hard. \n\n\nUnfortunately I'm not able to change the locks (landlord said no) but my tenancy ends on the 12th of June and I already have a new flat to move into.

I would block everyone and focus on your own healing.", "NTA \n\nFirstly, let me say, I am so very sorry for your loss. Those words are clich\u00e9 and trite, but they are all I have. \n\nSecondly, the sperm donor dropped off the face of the earth because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t deal\u201d, and then he has the audacity to say *you* should\u2019ve tried harder to reach him?? I\u2019m sorry, but you tried, repeatedly. Not just to contact him, but also his family. **They** didn\u2019t answer. **They** weren\u2019t there for you during any of this. That was **their** choice. **You** tried the hardest you could, whilst going into early labour, having a sick baby in NICU, and eventually his passing + the funeral. You didn\u2019t have the mental bandwidth to keep going. And to me, that\u2019s totally acceptable. What\u2019s unacceptable is **his** and his family\u2019s decision to be unreachable (by blocking you or whatever). \n\nThirdly, please change your locks so that he can\u2019t just let himself in and come and go as he pleases. You\u2019re going through enough, without having to deal with coming home to him sitting on your couch out of the blue. \n\nLastly, your sister needs to grow TF up. What an immature response.

I can\u2019t imagine how hard it is.", "NTA, your ex completely cut contact with you, obviously you weren\u2019t able to tell him under these conditions.

I agree with the others, I\u2019d suggest to cut contact completely, you don\u2019t want people like this in your life.", "Your sister is an AH. it is not your job to be responsible for him.

Wtf??? You are absolutely 100% NTA. They are all horrible people. Change your locks and block them all.", "NTA.  Let\u2019s be clear, he abandons you when you are at your most valuable and shows up months later and what!?  How much more can you try when you literally went to their house and nothing.

I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019ve had to go through the loss of your baby.  You don\u2019t owe him, or his family anything. A 28 year old that runs home to hide with his mama during your pregnancy in itself speaks volumes about him.   And then to gaslight you and try to blame you for non contact is despicable.

Fuck those people.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA. Him and his family are disgusting for treating you like that! Not only did you try to contact them multiple times but so did your parents! You gave birth and lost your son, had to arrange a funeral and cope with all of that without him and his family because they couldn\u2019t be bothered! If I were you I would report any messages they send you because it\u2019s harassment. Cut them all out of your life, you are better off!

To hell with those ppl!", "Clearly NTA.\n\nHow exactly did they want you to contact them? (Facepalm)", "NTA. You tried to contact them, it they wanted to be available to you, you'd reach. You were living a nightmare and you were living it without your partner. They are the ones who closed the communication channels, they are the ones who didn't contact you about your child around the time he was supposed to be born to check if everything is okay even though they knew the due date, your ex shows up after 5 months and practically breaks into your apartment and has the audacity to be hostile towards you. He and his family can be angry for what happened to anyone else but you.\n\nChange your locks and block everyone who contacted you from his side of the family.

If anything you should be livid at those people for letting you hang when you needed support. And it's totally on them for going nc with you and therefore not knowing what happend to you and your child. It's been 5 months before the **** even reached out to you (and let himself in your home without your consent!).

Why haven't you blocked them all now?", "NTA\n\nAs someone who was also abandoned during a pregnancy that ended without a living child your ex can stick his special bits in a meat grinder.\n\nANYONE who accuses you of having done something wrong is an asshole. Especially if they are family! OP I am mad for you because it was 1,000,000% not your sister's place to pass judgement as she clearly has no idea what she is talking about.\n\nIt's time to find your self worth and go nuclear. *Do not* allow others to sit on their thrones of arrogance only to put you down. You survived through a horrendous experience and that alone probably makes you tougher than any of these assholes passing judgement.\n\nYou are not soft and broken. You are resilient and powerful.", "NTA.\n\nFirstly I am really sorry for your loss.\n\nHe convinced you to keep the child, but then heartlessly abandoned you while you were pregnant. Despite facing such a devastating situation, you made numerous attempts to contact him and his family, desperately seeking support. Despite your own tremendous loss, you never gave up on reaching out.\n\nI understand being overwhelmed by unplanned pregnancy, but the way he handled it makes him the biggest AH in this situation. Your sister is a soft AH as well, for putting the blame on you despite what you went through.", "NTA and so sorry that you had to go through with it again. You should have told the so called family that if they can find bigger AHs than them, you would listen to them. Its fine for them to cut contact whenever it suits them and does sound like a horrible family to be associated with.

No. No no no. This man ghosted you when you were pregnant. His mother ghosted you. You tried to tell them and they didn't respond. There is no You Should Have Tried Harder in this situation.

I hope you heal.", "Nta he didn't want to be contacted he was trying to advoid responsibility him not knowing is on him. He shouldn't have come into your house in the first place.\n\nYour landlords also messed up for not allowing you to change the lock.", "If you can\u2019t change the locks, get a doorbell camera. So sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Gutless AHs like your ex who abandon their partner and child to run home to mommy deserve no closure and no mercy. You and your parents tried to notify him and his family but his cowardice was too intense  for him to read or listen to anything coming in NEAR YOUR KNOWN DUE DATE? This is wholly on him. He robbed himself and his awful mother of the only chance they'd ever have to meet his child, and I hope that knowledge gnaws his heart every day for the rest of his life.\n\nYour sister owes you a profound apology.", "[removed]", "I\u2019m almost shaking I\u2019m so angry for you. The goddamned AUDACITY of that man. NTA. In no universe would you be the asshole. And I hate him with the burning fire of a thousand herpes.\n\nSo much love to you. I hope you heal well.", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.  It\u2019s your turn now to block these atrocious persons from your life.  As for your sister, I suggest low contact with her until you find yourself in a better place both physically and emotionally.  I will be praying for you OP.  Wishing you peace and comfort.", "NTA", "First off, I am so very sorry for your loss. \nNTA. Fuck them all. \nAs someone who lost my first child to stillbirth AND had the father (my husband) with me to support me, it's still beyond traumatic. I honestly don't remember a good couple months after losing her - it's all one giant blur. Some things my husband will talk about, I don't even remember at all. I was diagnosed with PTSD because of this. \nFor your own piece of mind and sanity, know that you did NOTHING WRONG. You did what you could to contact him, not your fault he ignored you. Also, CHANGE YOUR LOCKS!!! Who TF does he think he is letting himself into your home?!?\n\nEdit: I even lost friends over my child's death. A couple that we were friends with called my husband yelling at him because they found out a few weeks after it happened. They were upset we didn't jump through hoops to contact them so 'they could be there for us'. My response was I am so sorry I was busy grieving the loss of my child. Some people are just shitty.", "Hey OP, if you REALLY want concrete proof to get him off your back, pull your phone records. Send them to him, and also send a letter detailing how he ABANDONED you and this is HIS FAULT and tell him to fuck off. NTA and I'm so so sorry.", "I mean.. how could you ever think you did anything wrong. I'm sorry you went through that and hope you're taking care of yourself! This man is no good at all. Nta.", "NTA at all", "I'm so very, very sorry for your loss.  \n\nFuck your ex and his family.  You don't get to disappear for 5 months and then show up and expect anything from anybody. \n\nYou tried your best.  Actually,  you did more than I would have.  I would have made 1 phone and sent 1 text to him, and left it at that.", "NTA OP.  Your ex and his mom didn\u2019t even deign to respond to your repeated messages, so screw them both.", "NTA. Him and his entire family abandoned you in your darkest time. They can all go straight to the deepest darkest circles of hell.", "NTA, in any way shape or form\n\nYour ex wanted to have a baby, then ghosted you before the baby was born.   OP & family attempted to reach out several times with no response.   Ex then shows up with threats and accusations?   Im so sorry you had to go through all of this with your son, and then face verbal abuse from your ex.   I would get a restraining order and see if that can force your landlord to change the locks.", "NTA, he ghosted his pregnant partner and then just showed up months later. He's the AH 100%. He even had the audacity to let himself into the home he abandoned. WTF? You are so not the AH, I'm sorry you are going through all of this. It shouldn't have happened, and you didn't deserve any of it.", "[removed]", "One more candidate for AH in this story:  OP's sister, telling OP that she should've kept trying to contact absent daddy.  FFS, really?  The woman is grieving the loss of her child.  \n\nOP is NTA.  \n\n(And hugs!!)", "[removed]", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss.\n\nYou tried, which is probably more than many people would do after he basically abandoned you.  Thank goodness you are not married to this guy because he is a jerk multiple times over.\n\nTake care.", "NTA. You tried to tell them. They ghosted you. Change your locks.", "NTA. You really tried. Don\u2019t let them gaslight you like this.\n\nI am also so so sorry. I can\u2019t imagine this heartbreak. I hope you find peace and happiness. You deserve it.", "NTA so so sorry for your loss. Block them all do not respond to them. Get a camera and point it at your door. I\u2019d definitely get some kind of chain or bolt lock for inside the door when I\u2019m home. F the landlord wouldn\u2019t even ask. Is he on the lease at all? If not and he shows up again call the cops. He and his family obviously didn\u2019t give a damn. Move as soon as you can and don\u2019t tell him or the landlord where. If landlord needs an address get a pi box for a couple months. Good luck", "Nta\n\nF*ck your ex, his mother, all of his family harassing you, and honestly your sister too. \n\nNot only did that fool abandon you to go running home to his mother he never said anything to you. Shocked he sent money. But you DID try. You sent countless text and messages from the time you gave birth to the time you buried your kid. Hell you even said your parents tried to contact him and his mother. You guys were all met with radio silence. \n\nHe waited until the kid would have been 5 month to just let himself in. He hasn\u2019t lived there is what close to a year and just barges in. Creep and I\u2019m glad your getting out soon. He and his mother had 5 months to look at all the messages you sent or listen to the voice mails left. They probably just deleted them without looking/listening to em. \n\nHe and his family only have themselves to blame for not \u2018knowing\u2019. You and your folks went well beyond trying to let them know. The only other way would have been going to their place (bad idea) or what send a certified letter letting them know that they would have had to sign for. Even then that could have been thrown out or rejected.", "Think about getting a restraining order from this a-hole. He is pathetic. Stay strong. NTA", "nta not even close and i'd tell your ex off", "NTA. You did everything you could do. You were so strong. Please take this time to heal yourself. You have done nothing wrong.\n\nYour ex and his family are horrible people. Please stay away from them.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nIf they won't stop getting on at you, maybe send them screen shots of the messages and call attempts..?\n\nYou did MORE than enough to try and get hold of them!! It's in no way your fault they refused to respond", "I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nYou are NTA\n\nPlease block all of those awful, toxic people.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\n\nYour ex bailed on you while you were pregnant, ghosted you and then thought he could waltz back in 7 months later with demands.\n\nYou did everything you could to let him know, whilst going through yet another- but far worse- traumatic event.\n\nNTA\n\nMy heart goes out to you. Much love sweetheart xx", "Seriously though, what a bunch of ghouls these people are. They *blocked* you, or at least ignored you, and now they're trying to blame *you*, the grieving mother, for not having any mental energy left to try and force their recalcitrant asses to communicate with you? Hell no.", ">I suggest changing the locks\n\nPlease do this", "So much this. This post hurt my heart. \n\nI'm so sorry OP.", "Tf is wrong with OPs sister? She\u2019s insane too", "This. So sorry for you. I suggest to give them the Same curtesy: Just send the short summary of their BS behaviour (Like a 1 to 5 list ending with you never wish to hear from them again) to all of them \"in Response to your cruelness, ignorance and audacity\" and then directly block them.", "If the sister thought it was so important, why didn't she call? \n\nNTA but they and she are.\n\nEdited to add: they are trying to make you the villain so they don't have to face what they did.", "Even if she didn\u2019t know the specifics of how hard OP tried to get into contact, the sisters comment is just bloody insensitive to someone who went through abandonment by her supposed partner (and his whole damn family), pregnancy, premature birth and then the death of her child alone. \n\nOP was going through a lot. It would\u2019ve completely understandable if \u201ctry and contact deadbeat sperm donor again\u201d missed out on a spot on her to do list.", "Even if she had the emotional bandwidth..how many times would you try to contact someone who has made it clear they want nothing to do with you? I mean at some point it could even be considered harassment or stalking! This is on him and his family and was the minute he walked out and blocked her. Choices have consequences and now he can deal with them,", "And the audacity to just show up IN the house with no notice? Not just at the door\u2014 IN the house. After months. Fuck that guy and everyone who thinks OP is the AH.", "And the ex's timing alone makes him and his whole family TA. OP says he came by FIVE MONTHS after the death. So if she had made it the full 40 weeks that means he didn't call, contact, or stop by to see his son for the FIRST THREE MONTHS! And yet somehow, OP is the AH? Please. And maybe OP should say this to the ex's family. Like even if he hadn't blocked OP on everything, he knew the math and when she was due so he clearly didn't care if he waited until 3 months after the due date to even check in.", "No excuse for your sister. Hoping she us gone or changed her opinion.", "With the edit, I wouldn't stay there a second longer. I'd seek temporary accomodations and move my shit out ASAP. And sister gets to go on a very long time out.", "A buffer is a solid advice. OP has more than enough on her plate right now, this could help a lot.", "This is a great idea. OP, I hope you read this comment. You deserve a buffer.", "Yeah, *conveniently* right around the time he would've been able to get a few cute pics for social media and then bounce again, had OP's pregnancy gone as planned. Fucking ghoul.", "Your sister is also an asshole.", "Agreed. But I would say take it to fb and publicly shame him and his family. Make a post and tag them and people they know. What he did was so unbelievably cruel. I wouldn\u2019t even wish it on my worst enemy.", "Not a soft AH, a full-blown AH nod to your sister.", "Lose that sister tho.", "He didn\u2019t just lose his kid, he lost his kid when he walked out before the kid was even born.", "How is he not an asshole? He walked out on op at 20 weeks pregnant, and didn't attempt to have contact until 5 months after the baby had been born. Not only did he disappear on op when he finally decides he's ready to show his face, he doesn't even call op as a curtsy he just shows up to her house. Instead of talking to her he storms out the house and sends his family to harass op. At no point during any of this does he deserve a pass.", "I think to meant NTA she freaking tried to contact them but they blocked her thats on them 100%. The only assholes in this situation is her ex and his asshole mom.", "[deleted]", "She and others tried to tell him, his mother and their family. OP NTA.", "What more was she meant to do? She texted, called, got her parents to attempt contact, he didn\u2019t want to be contacted. Short of sending out a carrier pigeon, I fail to see how else she could have let him know.", "I\u2019m so sorry for everything you are going through.
