Also, throwaway as my ex follows my main.\n\n\nBoth myself (F) and my partner (M) were 28 when I found out I was pregnant. Together 4 years. \n\nPersonally I didn't want the child, my work was offering potential advances within my position and I was excited for it. But after alot of talking, we decided to go forward with it. \n\n\nWhen I was around 20 weeks (just after finding out the gender) he disappeared. I couldn't contact him, he wouldn't answer the phone or messages. I got worried and messaged his mother and found out he was living back with her and was overwhelmed with the situation. He kept paying his part of the bills over to my bank each month, but I received no contact. I even tried going over, nothing. \n\n\nBy about 27 weeks I gave up trying, gave up crying and just got on with what I thought was a future as a single mother. I brought everything needed over the next couple of weeks and set it all up. \n\n\nAt 31 weeks I started having pains, but put it down to braxton hicks. Just before 32 weeks my waters went and I went into labour, with the baby coming very quickly. He went straight to NICU. I messaged and rang my ex and his mother, no response. \n\n\nLess than a week later, my son passed due to complications of early birth. I again tried to contact my ex and his mother. Left voicemails and messages. Nothing \n\n\nThe next few weeks were a blur, but with the help of my mother and father his funeral was arranged. They tried to contact ex and his mother also, still nothing. I sent more messages, nothing. I'm assuming we were probably all blocked but honestly at that point I didn't care. I was so broken. \n\n\nHis funeral came and went. It was beautiful and horrible. I stopped messaging and told my family not to bother after the funeral had passed. I couldn't deal with it any more.\n\n\nAbout 5 months after his birth/death my ex turned up. Let himself in. \nI wasn't at home, but when I got back he was instantly hostile. The flat was clearly not set up for nor accommodating a small child. \n\nHe demanded to see his son. I broke down and told him what happened. I have never seen him so sad and angry. He stormed out, slamming the door on his way out.\n\n\nWithin half an hour I got a nasty call from his mother, followed by messages from siblings/other family. How dare I not let them know something so serious. How could I hide something like that out of petty spite. \n\n\nI truly didn't, I tried. But I couldn't keep trying. It's been nearly 3 weeks now of them being awful. I was speaking to my sister this weekend and she said \"tbf, it was a bit of a dick move to not keep trying. They deserved to know\" \n\n\nWas it? I tried so hard to let him know, but I was struggling so hard too. I lost my son too. AITA? should I have done more??\n\n\nEdit - thank you all so much for your responses. Sorry for not replying to any. Reading them has been alot. \n\nHonestly, I'm going to drink a bottle of wine (or two), read your kind responses and cry myself to sleep. Writing this all out and living it again has been hard. \n\n\nUnfortunately I'm not able to change the locks (landlord said no) but my tenancy ends on the 12th of June and I already have a new flat to move into.

I would block everyone and focus on your own healing.", "NTA \n\nFirstly, let me say, I am so very sorry for your loss. Those words are clich\u00e9 and trite, but they are all I have. \n\nSecondly, the sperm donor dropped off the face of the earth because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t deal\u201d, and then he has the audacity to say *you* should\u2019ve tried harder to reach him?? I\u2019m sorry, but you tried, repeatedly. Not just to contact him, but also his family. **They** didn\u2019t answer. **They** weren\u2019t there for you during any of this. That was **their** choice. **You** tried the hardest you could, whilst going into early labour, having a sick baby in NICU, and eventually his passing + the funeral. You didn\u2019t have the mental bandwidth to keep going. And to me, that\u2019s totally acceptable. What\u2019s unacceptable is **his** and his family\u2019s decision to be unreachable (by blocking you or whatever). \n\nThirdly, please change your locks so that he can\u2019t just let himself in and come and go as he pleases. You\u2019re going through enough, without having to deal with coming home to him sitting on your couch out of the blue. \n\nLastly, your sister needs to grow TF up. What an immature response.

I can\u2019t imagine how hard it is.", "NTA, your ex completely cut contact with you, obviously you weren\u2019t able to tell him under these conditions.

He doesn\u2019t have the right to expect you to tell him when he doesn\u2019t let you contact him. I am so sorry for your loss and this whole situation, you deserve so much better. I agree with the others, I\u2019d suggest to cut contact completely, you don\u2019t want people like this in your life.", "Your sister is an AH. it is not your job to be responsible for him.

He should've tried,  period.", "NTA  you did your parst your parents tried reaching out and all the screenshots to shut everyone up your sister is a major AH if she cared she should of reach out... change your locks and go NC... sounds horrible", "Excuse me, I would like their contact info so I can scream at them. Wtf??? You are absolutely 100% NTA. They are all horrible people. Change your locks and block them all.", "NTA.  Let\u2019s be clear, he abandons you when you are at your most valuable and shows up months later and what!?  How much more can you try when you literally went to their house and nothing.

I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019ve had to go through the loss of your baby.  You don\u2019t owe him, or his family anything. A 28 year old that runs home to hide with his mama during your pregnancy in itself speaks volumes about him.   And then to gaslight you and try to blame you for non contact is despicable. I hope you are able to get any resources that you need in order to help you with the loss of your baby.", "I\u2019m so sorry for what you went through. As for your ex and his family, just block them. Fuck those people.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA. Him and his family are disgusting for treating you like that! Not only did you try to contact them multiple times but so did your parents! You gave birth and lost your son, had to arrange a funeral and cope with all of that without him and his family because they couldn\u2019t be bothered! If I were you I would report any messages they send you because it\u2019s harassment. Cut them all out of your life, you are better off!

To hell with those ppl!", "Clearly NTA.\n\nHow exactly did they want you to contact them? (Facepalm)", "NTA. You tried to contact them, it they wanted to be available to you, you'd reach. You were living a nightmare and you were living it without your partner. They are the ones who closed the communication channels, they are the ones who didn't contact you about your child around the time he was supposed to be born to check if everything is okay even though they knew the due date, your ex shows up after 5 months and practically breaks into your apartment and has the audacity to be hostile towards you. He and his family can be angry for what happened to anyone else but you.\n\nChange your locks and block everyone who contacted you from his side of the family.

If anything you should be livid at those people for letting you hang when you needed support. And it's totally on them for going nc with you and therefore not knowing what happend to you and your child. It's been 5 months before the **** even reached out to you (and let himself in your home without your consent!).

Why haven't you blocked them all now?", "NTA\n\nAs someone who was also abandoned during a pregnancy that ended without a living child your ex can stick his special bits in a meat grinder.\n\nANYONE who accuses you of having done something wrong is an asshole. Especially if they are family! OP I am mad for you because it was 1,000,000% not your sister's place to pass judgement as she clearly has no idea what she is talking about.\n\nIt's time to find your self worth and go nuclear. *Do not* allow others to sit on their thrones of arrogance only to put you down. You survived through a horrendous experience and that alone probably makes you tougher than any of these assholes passing judgement.\n\nYou are not soft and broken. You are resilient and powerful.", "NTA.\n\nFirstly I am really sorry for your loss.\n\nHe convinced you to keep the child, but then heartlessly abandoned you while you were pregnant. Despite facing such a devastating situation, you made numerous attempts to contact him and his family, desperately seeking support. Despite your own tremendous loss, you never gave up on reaching out. I understand being overwhelmed by unplanned pregnancy but the way he handled it makes him the biggest AH in this situation. Your sister is a soft AH as well, for putting the blame on you despite what you went through.", "NTA and so sorry that you had to go through with it again. You should have told the so called family that if they can find bigger AHs than them, you would listen to them.

No. No no no. This man ghosted you when you were pregnant. His mother ghosted you. You tried to tell them and they didn't respond. There is no You Should Have Tried Harder in this situation.

That they and their family are the worst people you know, that when learning of a mother losing her child, they decide to harass her because her spineless, cowardly, worthless partner wasn't there at all and then just demands stuff when he does decide to reenter your life.

His abandoning you does not create an obligation on your end. HE had an obligation to stay in contact - you reaching out was a courtesy not a requirement.

No. No matter what they will tell you, nobody in their right mind would consider that you were supposed to put your own grief aside for somebody who treated you and your baby like you meant nothing. You lost your baby shortly after his birth. He lost his baby the minute he ghosted both of you. You lost a baby you were expecting to welcome in the world. He chose to turn his back on his baby.
