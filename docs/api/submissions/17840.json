Also, throwaway as my ex follows my main.\n\n\nBoth myself (F) and my partner (M) were 28 when I found out I was pregnant. Together 4 years. \n\nPersonally I didn't want the child, my work was offering potential advances within my position and I was excited for it. But after alot of talking, we decided to go forward with it. \n\n\nWhen I was around 20 weeks (just after finding out the gender) he disappeared. I couldn't contact him, he wouldn't answer the phone or messages. I got worried and messaged his mother and found out he was living back with her and was overwhelmed with the situation. He kept paying his part of the bills over to my bank each month, but I received no contact. I even tried going over, nothing. \n\n\nBy about 27 weeks I gave up trying, gave up crying and just got on with what I thought was a future as a single mother. I brought everything needed over the next couple of weeks and set it all up. \n\n\nAt 31 weeks I started having pains, but put it down to braxton hicks. Just before 32 weeks my waters went and I went into labour, with the baby coming very quickly. He went straight to NICU. I messaged and rang my ex and his mother, no response. \n\n\nLess than a week later, my son passed due to complications of early birth. I again tried to contact my ex and his mother. Left voicemails and messages. Nothing \n\n\nThe next few weeks were a blur, but with the help of my mother and father his funeral was arranged. They tried to contact ex and his mother also, still nothing. I sent more messages, nothing. I'm assuming we were probably all blocked but honestly at that point I didn't care. I was so broken. \n\n\nHis funeral came and went. It was beautiful and horrible. I stopped messaging and told my family not to bother after the funeral had passed. I couldn't deal with it any more.\n\n\nAbout 5 months after his birth/death my ex turned up. Let himself in. \nI wasn't at home, but when I got back he was instantly hostile. The flat was clearly not set up for nor accommodating a small child. \n\nHe demanded to see his son. I broke down and told him what happened. I have never seen him so sad and angry. He stormed out, slamming the door on his way out.\n\n\nWithin half an hour I got a nasty call from his mother, followed by messages from siblings/other family. How dare I not let them know something so serious. How could I hide something like that out of petty spite. \n\n\nI truly didn't, I tried. But I couldn't keep trying. It's been nearly 3 weeks now of them being awful. I was speaking to my sister this weekend and she said \"tbf, it was a bit of a dick move to not keep trying. They deserved to know\" \n\n\nWas it? I tried so hard to let him know, but I was struggling so hard too. I lost my son too. AITA? should I have done more??\n\n\nEdit - thank you all so much for your responses. Sorry for not replying to any. Reading them has been alot. \n\nHonestly, I'm going to drink a bottle of wine (or two), read your kind responses and cry myself to sleep. Writing this all out and living it again has been hard. \n\n\nUnfortunately I'm not able to change the locks (landlord said no) but my tenancy ends on the 12th of June and I already have a new flat to move into. And thankfully my dad has been able to cover the cost of a private therapist and I see her again Tuesday. \n\n\nThank you all so much again for your kind words\n\n\n2nd edit: if I had realised this was going to blow up so much then I probably would have just posted to my main.\n\nIf you see this post anyway, read it Lewis. Then read it again. Then read the comments. Then just leave me alone. \n\n\nThank you all for your comments. I'm going to show my therapist the post when I see her and talk it through, but honestly it has helped alot. Even if I did cry quite a bit. I'm going to sleep now and won't be back on this post.

If they hadn't, they would have known. It is their choices that have put them in this situation, NOT yours. I am so sorry for your loss. I would block everyone and focus on your own healing.", "NTA \n\nFirstly, let me say, I am so very sorry for your loss. Those words are clich\u00e9 and trite, but they are all I have. \n\nSecondly, the sperm donor dropped off the face of the earth because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t deal\u201d, and then he has the audacity to say *you* should\u2019ve tried harder to reach him?? I\u2019m sorry, but you tried, repeatedly. Not just to contact him, but also his family. **They** didn\u2019t answer. **They** weren\u2019t there for you during any of this. That was **their** choice. **You** tried the hardest you could, whilst going into early labour, having a sick baby in NICU, and eventually his passing + the funeral. You didn\u2019t have the mental bandwidth to keep going. And to me, that\u2019s totally acceptable. What\u2019s unacceptable is **his** and his family\u2019s decision to be unreachable (by blocking you or whatever). \n\nThirdly, please change your locks so that he can\u2019t just let himself in and come and go as he pleases. You\u2019re going through enough, without having to deal with coming home to him sitting on your couch out of the blue. \n\nLastly, your sister needs to grow TF up. What an immature response. She must know you tried. And with all you were dealing with, I don\u2019t think you could have tried any harder.

What an awful person.", "Part of the privilege of parenthood involves being there for your child, even when it\u2019s not convenient or when it\u2019s not something you want in that moment. He lost his right to call himself a parent when he couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t support you and your son through pregnancy, birth, and death. That he and his family flat-out ignored you for what sounds like months speaks volumes to his character. NTA, and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it is.", "NTA, your ex completely cut contact with you, obviously you weren\u2019t able to tell him under these conditions. This isn\u2019t your fault, he is the one who left his pregnant (ex) girlfriend alone while she was pregnant and had to get through the death of her son. He doesn\u2019t have the right to expect you to tell him when he doesn\u2019t let you contact him. I am so sorry for your loss and this whole situation, you deserve so much better. I agree with the others, I\u2019d suggest to cut contact completely, you don\u2019t want people like this in your life.", "Your sister is an AH. it is not your job to be responsible for him.

He should've tried,  period.", "NTA  you did your parst your parents tried reaching out and all the screenshots to shut everyone up your sister is a major AH if she cared she should of reach out... change your locks and go NC... sounds horrible", "Excuse me, I would like their contact info so I can scream at them. Wtf??? You are absolutely 100% NTA. They are all horrible people. Change your locks and block them all.", "NTA.  Let\u2019s be clear, he abandons you when you are at your most valuable and shows up months later and what!?  How much more can you try when you literally went to their house and nothing.  They have no right here and should be ashamed of themselves and their treatment of you.  I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019ve had to go through the loss of your baby.  You don\u2019t owe him, or his family anything. A 28 year old that runs home to hide with his mama during your pregnancy in itself speaks volumes about him.   And then to gaslight you and try to blame you for non contact is despicable. I hope you are able to get any resources that you need in order to help you with the loss of your baby.", "I\u2019m so sorry for what you went through. As for your ex and his family, just block them. Fuck those people.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA. Him and his family are disgusting for treating you like that! Not only did you try to contact them multiple times but so did your parents! You gave birth and lost your son, had to arrange a funeral and cope with all of that without him and his family because they couldn\u2019t be bothered! If I were you I would report any messages they send you because it\u2019s harassment. Cut them all out of your life, you are better off! I\u2019m so incredibly sorry for your loss and all the pain that has come with it.", "NTA. You tried repeatedly to contact your ex & his mom. I don't know what else you could have done.

To hell with those ppl!", "Clearly NTA.\n\nHow exactly did they want you to contact them? (Facepalm)", "NTA. You tried to contact them, it they wanted to be available to you, you'd reach. You were living a nightmare and you were living it without your partner. They are the ones who closed the communication channels, they are the ones who didn't contact you about your child around the time he was supposed to be born to check if everything is okay even though they knew the due date, your ex shows up after 5 months and practically breaks into your apartment and has the audacity to be hostile towards you. He and his family can be angry for what happened to anyone else but you.\n\nChange your locks and block everyone who contacted you from his side of the family. I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nEditing to add: while at it, evaluate your relationship with your sister too. \"they deserved to know\". Okay...

If anything you should be livid at those people for letting you hang when you needed support. And it's totally on them for going nc with you and therefore not knowing what happend to you and your child. It's been 5 months before the **** even reached out to you (and let himself in your home without your consent!).

You did try what else were you supposed to do it\u2019s their fault for blocking you and making themselves not contactable. Change the locks on your house and block him and any of his family.

Why haven't you blocked them all now?", "NTA\n\nAs someone who was also abandoned during a pregnancy that ended without a living child your ex can stick his special bits in a meat grinder.\n\nANYONE who accuses you of having done something wrong is an asshole. Especially if they are family! OP I am mad for you because it was 1,000,000% not your sister's place to pass judgement as she clearly has no idea what she is talking about.\n\nIt's time to find your self worth and go nuclear. *Do not* allow others to sit on their thrones of arrogance only to put you down. You survived through a horrendous experience and that alone probably makes you tougher than any of these assholes passing judgement.\n\nYou are not soft and broken. You are resilient and powerful.", "NTA.\n\nFirstly I am really sorry for your loss.\n\nHe convinced you to keep the child, but then heartlessly abandoned you while you were pregnant. Despite facing such a devastating situation, you made numerous attempts to contact him and his family, desperately seeking support. Despite your own tremendous loss, you never gave up on reaching out.\n\nI understand being overwhelmed by unplanned pregnancy, but the way he handled it makes him the biggest AH in this situation. Your sister is a soft AH as well, for putting the blame on you despite what you went through.", "NTA and so sorry that you had to go through with it again. You should have told the so called family that if they can find bigger AHs than them, you would listen to them. Its fine for them to cut contact whenever it suits them and does sound like a horrible family to be associated with. Move on and maybe all that happened was for some hidden purpose from the higher ups. Block them and tell them to get lost.", "My heart absolutely breaks for you.

No. No no no. This man ghosted you when you were pregnant. His mother ghosted you. You tried to tell them and they didn't respond. There is no You Should Have Tried Harder in this situation. You were hurting and grieving and had to bury your baby. HE SHOULD HAVE TRIED HARDER NOT TO BE A COMPLETE LOSER JERKFACE.\n\nHe just let himself in? No. No no no. That's not okay.

Even if she thought that (and she'd be wrong) How dare she say that to you at this time?? \n\nI'm sorry but your sister clearly lacks good judgment here. I would be concerned that she hooks up with your ex because she's got that type of judgment. \n\nMake sure you put up a no trespassing sign on your door since you can't change the locks.. and I would go so far as putting a sign telling your ex that he is not allowed in your house and he will be trespassing if he does.

All by yourself.\n\nFrom what I\u2019m getting, he\u2019s trying to process the death of his son by trying to find the blame in someone: you. It\u2019s not a healthy coping mechanism and he needs to see a therapist. \n\nThe death of a newborn, an infant, a child, teenager, adult- it\u2019s never easy.

You tried everything and nothing worked; what else was there for you to do?\n\nYour sister has no idea how much you tried and to side with them, even by a smidge, is a slap on the wrist.

He's TA for abandoning you and making it impossible for you to contact him about your child's condition. \n\nThe only way I could possibly see pettiness in this is if you only called at inopportune times and only once or twice and your voice messages only said \"call me back\" or something. But hopefully at least enough details were in the messages to convey the seriousness. I know it's not great to share about a death in a voice-mail but if they won't pick up what else can you do? Another thing is if you knew his address or workplace to send a letter or have a friend or family member go in person if it's in town to let him know what happened.

You can't pick and choose to be a parent, you disgusting person!\n\n5. Now Lewis' fairytale has become a nightmare, he's made it about him and the AH family are attacking op because they chose to block and ignore her attempts to let them all know. Eh, projecting much? Likely they were all deluding themselves about being in baby's life once Lewis had a change of heart. Lewis own up to your total a-holery and tell them to back the.F.off op because her trauma is worsening. You told them lies and it's your fault you didn't know. Op did her best \n\nFinally op, you're far from the AH here. I'm disappointed in your sister for her words, she should shut up too. \n\nOp you need to heal and focus on you. Please change your phone number and come off SM. If they are blasting you in there, no one would blame you for releasing a statement but also consider a cease and desist from a lawyer. Therapy will help and hopefully once you're out of the apartment, you can cut all ties from Lewis who is a monster and doesn't deserve anyone's sympathy.

You dealt with so much and he and his awful family have no leg to stand on in ever being upset with you when they ignored every attempt at contact.\n\nAlso your sister better keep her wrong opinion to herself.\n\nYou just went through traumatic situation on your own and had to arrange a funeral. No way in heaven are you to blame.\n\nNTA", "Dear OP, NTA x 100,000,000,000,000, squared! Please accept my sincere condolences for the death of your son. I will keep you in my prayers for strength, healing, and grace to accept this horrific circumstance. Please block your ex and all of his family members. He left because he was overwhelmed by your pregnancy so you had to go through the pregnancy, birth and death of your son without your child's other parent there to support you. How dare he decide to just stroll back in once he had dealt with his whatever his issue, fears or concerns were which caused him to run back home to his mommy?! YOU TRIED! YOUR FAMILY TRIED! You called, texted, messaged and even went knocking on the door, all to no avail. He and his family were no-shows for this major life event because they were totally unaware of  your attempt to get in touch after they blocked you and before they blocked you, they ignored you. Please, do not use another second of your energy thinking about how Lewis feels about any of this - use your precious energy, time and effort to deal with you and allow yourself to process, heal, and continue living. You won't \"get over it\" but you will be able to go on with your life. One day, you may find yourself smiling and hopefully, not too long after that, you will be able to laugh and get through the day without crying. I thank God for providing you with a loving, caring , and supportive family to help you through this difficult time. Worry about you and leave Lewis in the past. His choice and he gets to live with that for the rest of his life because it sounds like he walked out on a wonderful woman. You let yourself heal and see what wonders life has for you in the future - I am sure it is something wonderful! Enjoy your wine!(Have a glass of wine for me sometime - I suffered a spinal injury and my medicine will not mix with alcohol so I cannot drink - please have one for me!)", "Fake. Fake. Fake", "And your sister is kind of an AH for her comment. I am so sorry for your loss and for what you have to go through on top of it. Definitely NTA", "I'm speculating here,  but it really sounds like he talked OP into NOT aborting and then he freaking vanished at the 20-week mark when it's often difficult to abort.", "Ikr. This is literally insane OP even said she didn\u2019t want to proceed with the baby because of a work opportunities and only went forward after a lengthy conversation with her ex. \n\nThis 30 year old man had a long conversation about having a kid, then bounced cause he\u2019s ~ *overwhelmed* ~. Lmao if he\u2019s overwhelmed how would OP, the person carrying the child, feel. He literally ghosted her cause he couldn\u2019t handle having a child he agreed to have, this guy is absolutely useless", "AND when he did finally want to see the kid, he was hostile from the get-go. What the hell was his motive?!", "I think OP's ex's family expected her to send in a proof of life team to extract him and make him read the numerous messages she and her family left regarding her pregnancy, the birth and death of her son.\n\nOP saying 'not trying harder' when she already went 10 times further than anybody else who'd been abandoned by their partner while pregnant and preparing to give birth and bring up a child alone.  \n\nNTA OP, but a part of me reckons you should give a detailing how many times you tried to contact him and ask them exactly what else did they want you to have done - buy giant billboards and sky writers around their house?", "He figured he\u2019d baby-trapped her and then went on a bender to celebrate with his mom enabling him, I\u2019m sure.", "Especially since in most places a 32 weeker has a 95-99% chance of survival. I think it\u2019s almost the same as a full term baby. \n\nIf a baby born at 32 weeks dies, I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s an underlying issue that caused poor health. \n\nAlso, blaming someone for indirectly causing premature labor or the death of a neonatal baby is gross. It\u2019s a step away from blaming the mother herself.", "She'd still be out for the funeral, and loss of income whilst pregnant and caring for a baby in NICU, plus emotional distress from his behaviour afterwards and *breaking into her house*.", "I know, wtf. He abandons his pregnant girlfriend then shows up when the baby would be 5 months and has the AUDICITY to lecture her about the home not being set up for a child?! While he would have been an absent father all this time if it weren\u2019t for OPs loss. He and his family are trash and knowing his true colors is the sole silver lining here.", "My first thought was he wanted to resume.. physical contact..", "Guys who do that are more likely to show up when the kid is at least in school already.  Out of diapers at the very least.", "Yes, that made me so mad. She\u2019s an asshole too.", "Well you know, she could have been going after that pesky child support but now that she's posted it on Reddit, they should obviously go flocking to op and ruthlessly judging her instead. /s", "Not only that but she tried several of them and no one got back to her? Like, they all knew there was a baby and none of them picked up the phone?", "I would have loved to be OPs big brother & be there for her when he decided to show up at her flat. \n\nI'm not 1 to advocate violence but if a dude pulled this shit on 1 of my 4 sisters. Oh lord jesus. \n\nHoping & praying for OP & her recovery.", "Hemingway called again and said, I couldn't have put it more elegantly than you. Keep the story under your name. Thanks.", "Makes you wonder what he told them all. Like maybe he told them she'd gotten an abortion against his will, now he's telling them that she must have lied to him, etc. I can't imagine another scenario in which an entire family would a) turn against her and not hear her out and b) not be expecting a kid at a certain time.", "I don't think it was related to paying for the pregnancy. She uses \"waters\" and \"flat\" so I suspect OP is British. Pretty sure maternity related healthcare is completely covered over there.\n\nI agree with the rest though! I saw another comment suggesting he got bored and figured he has her trapped now so might as well play house for a little bit. It feels about right.", "Nah, the worst part is that he was the one that convinced her to go ahead with the pregnancy in the first place when she didn't want it.", "This thread is now locked due to an excess of rule violations. \r\n\r\n[Sub Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) ||| [\"FAQs\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)", "Orrr, consider this...\n\nDon't.\n\nWoman is grieving and has had an extremely traumatic year. There is absolutely no reason she should be putting that much effort into contacting people who have made it extremely clear that they don't give a shit about her wellbeing by abandoning her in one of the toughest situations a woman can face. Raising a child alone with no support, dude wasn't even sending money to help with the kid knowing her work circumstances had changed and that his desires were the sole reason why she was even going to go through with having the child at all! \n\nAnd then for him to just show up and walk in unannounced and then rage at her as soon as she gets home?\n\nRidiculous. Honestly, the entire way he went about coming back into her life was extremely sketchy. Makes me wonder if he thought he'd take custody of the kid or something.\n\nAgain, absolutely no reason while in the middle of such a long term and traumatic experience to be expending energy trying to placate people who are either obviously abusive like boyfriend and mum or just don't give a shit about her feelings. Feel like they've made it pretty clear that they're useless. And even if boyfriend had lied to them, so what? They still never even tried to get her side or talk to her about what was going on. \n\nIf any of boyfriend's family cared about her well being, they would have reached out, even just one of them, once. Instead, they completely ignored her and decided to write off her entire existence until it suited them. She owes them absolutely nothing. She owes herself some grace and a permanent break from such a toxic family. A shitty situation all around here, but I'm glad she won't be stuck with them or tied to them for the rest of her life. Time to walk away and close the door behind her. She did the best she could with the situation she was given and she deserves to walk away with her head held high and no regrets about what she did or didn't do. There's no reason to lower her self esteem or self worth even more by trying to placate people who have already shown her exactly how vile they are.\n\nBlock them all and move forward.", "I\u2019ll be the third person. I majored in English in college so I\u2019m quite good at writing. I\u2019d probably be able to rip these assholes a new one. \n\nOP is 100000000000000% NTA.", "Can we play bad, worse, worst? As a single mom in a situation akin to hers I'd LOVE to this man a new one.", "I am still trying to figure out what the landlord was thinking as well.\n\nEx breaks back in with key.  Gets violent.  \"No, you cannot change the locks.\"  This is how domestic violence-related murders occur.\n\nOP, I would leave scathing reviews everywhere for this apartment complex after I moved.  I would warn all women that this management does not care if a woman is in danger.\n\nAnd I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nYour sister can suck it.", "You are talking about a woman whose adult son convinced his partner to go ahead with a pregnancy she didn't want, then abandoned the partner before the baby was born.   Your expectations of her are far too high, I doubt she can muster up any womanly solidarity.", "Seriously. When my friend's husband fucked off and left her with three kids, her MIL was horrified. Staged a full-on intervention where she expressed her disappointment in him and his shitty fathering. Was the on her dil's side, helped out with the kids, brought food over... and they have never even gotten along very well.", "NTA he was a deadbeat dad before the baby was even born. He lost all right to be pissed when he walked put on his pregnant partner and went no contact for months. Honestly wouldn't be surprised if the stress he caused led to the complications", "I wouldn't even try to contact him to begin with. He was a big part of why she decided to keep it and he just disappears and runs to mummy?? WTF. Wouldn't need to try to contact him in the first place if he was there doing the bare minimum. A grown ass man"]}
