It would be a lie to say she is a behaved child but she isn\u2019t. She is a difficult child which is something I work on. She throws tantrums, breaks things, and basically typical things that misbehaved children do.\n\nMy sister Jane and her wife Gabby (both 24female) agreed to babysit her as my usual nanny couldn\u2019t make it today. They both know how difficult my daughter is. \n\nWhen I came to pick her up Jane said that Ame (my daughter) broke their vase that Gabby\u2019s grandmother gave her. I was furious and immediately said that I would pay up for it and asked for how much it cost. Gabby proceeded to say that the vase was over 800 dollars.\n\nI was a bit taken aback. If it was 5-20 I would\u2019ve paid up but over 800 is expensive. So I told them I wanted proof that she broke it because I wasn\u2019t just going to pay up that much even if I could afford it if I didn\u2019t know for sure Ame broke it.\n\nThey have cameras pointing to where the vase was so showing the proof would\u2019ve been no big deal. But they refused to show the footage and said it was none of my business. They also said that they weren\u2019t even in the room when the vase broke so they don\u2019t know for sure that Ame broke it. \n\nI told them that they don\u2019t even know for sure that Ame broke it which is why they refuse to show the cameras. I told them that they\u2019re crazy if they think I\u2019m going to pay that much for something that they don\u2019t even know if Ame broke.\n\nThey told our entire families and all are saying that this whole thing will be solved if they just show the footage. I will most definitely pay up if I see proof that they broke it. So AITA?\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that the vase wasn\u2019t in Ame\u2019s range so I don\u2019t know how she would be able to even get it but Jane and Gabby also have three cats that can reach it.\n\nNot to mention I saw the vase and it doesn\u2019t look as expensive as they said it was. It looks like a cheap vase from Walmart.", "created_utc": 1683765205, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13e88fd/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_a_case_my_daughter/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
