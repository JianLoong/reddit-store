There is nothing wrong with you, and the only reason you should ever try to lose weight is if you want to do it FOR YOURSELF. Shame on any mother who body shames her own child like this.", "NTA. She knows it hurts you. That\u2019s why she says it. She deserved to feel bad and cry. People who enjoy picking at others usually feel bad about themselves and take it out on others. My only advice would be to avoid her and enjoy your life. You\u2019d waste your time trying to change someone like that. I\u2019m sorry she hurt you. You deserve better.", "NTA. I hate when parents think they can just call out insecurities on their kids, she shouldn't even be worrying about when you're getting married because its your life, not hers. Her bringing up your size which could possibly have nothing to do with marriage is toxic, she's looking for something to bring you down so you can't have a positive mindset about yourself, so please don't let it work.", "NTA. You mom should just shut up.", "NTA. Simply telling your mom to shut-up is pretty polite compared to what she deserves.\n\nShe's very lucky you maintain a relationship of any kind with her. Just because someone is \"family\" doesn't mean they get to treat others any ol' way they want to.\n\nIt feels wrong for her to talk like this to you *because it is wrong*.", "NTA\n\nThe relationship between moms and daughters is very complex and sometimes moms forget that their words hurt.   Their motives are probably noble, but to constantly be lambasted for weight issues makes you question your worth in the world obsessed with the skinny from the one person who **should** be supportive.    I had a mother like this, so I know how it feels.   She always thought if it'd just do it her way I'd be a happy, contented person, completely bypassing my needs, emotions, wants and desires.  If she keeps this up, get out of there and live your life.   If you want to lose for yourself, do it, but don't do it because of your mother.

NTA, but you are going to have to learn coping mechanisms that don't involve hiding in your room. I'm 43 and my mom still makes completely inappropriate comments about my weight.

Learn to lean into what makes you feel good about yourself.\nNTA, btw.", "nta, shes emotionally abusive for that lol", "Nta.", "NTA\n\nMy mom does the same insulting shit. Every time she sees me, she'll pinch my under arms or my belly and say, \"You've gotten fatter,\" and tell me she just wants me to be skinny and pretty again. I used to be thinner when I was younger, but never was I your stereotypical \"skinny\"\n\nI've always been a little thicker, but now, because I'm fat, she takes it as a personal offense.\n\nBut she's a meth addicted alcoholic living on the streets, so I just remind her of that. \n\nTit for tat, I say.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like mine. I was working out at the time and she told me that I should have lost at least 10 lbs by now (I wasn't big at that time). It started a fight, she hit me with a wooden spoon and I didn't speak to her for 3 months. When I did, I told her she wasn't allowed to comment on my weight anymore and let her know that I'd have no issues never seeing her again. I didn't have body image issues until she pulled this shit and it still pisses me off.", "I hate when people insult you, you call them out, and then they act like the victim. You should ask your mom what it's like to be perfect.", "So your mother has been emotionally abusing you by belittling and demeaning you and then you feel guilty ffs sweetie you are NTA! She is the AH. Go to therapy to work through this toxic crap she put into your head and some space between you and her please. She didn't deserve you in her life if she can't be a decent human being to her own child.", "NTA my friend is 350lbs, she's not tall, she's been happily married for 7 years now, your mom is fatphobic and you deserve better", "I agree. My own mother fat shamed me until I went off on her. Mind you I have had three kids and have tried several times to lose the baby weight I gained each time and struggle. I finally accepted myself and my husband supports me to slowly lose weight by changing our dieting slightly to help in this. Cut down but not cutting out sugars, breads, etc. \nShe occasionally now fat Shane\u2019s my 10 yr old who isn\u2019t skinny or fat just average but because my mom says she could lose ten pounds says stuff to her all the time. Even went to the lengths to weigh her when she visits and then yells at me if she gained weight from the prior time but never congratulates her when she actually loses weight. Tell her it\u2019s a nice start but she could lose more. \n\nSo NTA, parents are suppose to be a safe place to make you feel loved and comfortable. Your mother has not provided that so you telling her to shut up was proper. Sorry but maybe she should cry over this like she has most likely made you cry over her heartless comments.", "yta", "Why does hurting people give you pleasure?
