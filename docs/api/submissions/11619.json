Autism doesn't mean you can be inconsiderate to those around you.

You may have been told that wearing headphones is antisocial, but that's not always true. It can be confusing to get every little social rule (especially when those around you find them obvious and may be annoyed by you not understanding them, a little bit of projection here lol). Communication is key, and also try to be understanding of others around you.

Autism is still a spectrum, which means experiences will vary from autistic to autistic. Many of us have to have music or TV loud for hours on end or even at all times as a self controlled stimulation just to prevent the other sounds and stimuli of the world around us from causing meltdowns or other behavior considered by many to be \u201cage inappropriate\u201d.", "It\u2019s AITA, not Am I Autistic Enough for You. And stims are still not defined in the DSM-V like you claimed.\n\nThe tv volume was one example, but not representative of the entire issue, which is that OP needs sound all the time and flatmate wants silence. In another comment, OP said they\u2019ve reached a compromise with their flatmates, so they were clearly willing to work on the situation with their flatmate. They just didn\u2019t initially understand that they could meet their needs with headphones without being antisocial.", "It usually only applies (a) between 10pm and 7am (got told noise before 8am was okay as the noisy contractor was 'making a living' and I was only trying to sleep on a weekend) and (b) when the police feel like enforcing it...which doesn't include if they are friends with the perp.", "It means that it has to be reasonably quiet. You can\u2019t blast music all day and night.", "CONTEXT", "Check the settings on your TV, it should have different sound options.\n\nSounds like you might have and audio processing problem. Most brains pick and choose what info they pass on to the conscious part of the mind, focussing in on the person you're talking to, or latching onto your name in a crowded room.\n\nSome people's brains say \"THIS IS ALL IMPORTANT STUFF YOU MUST HAVE AND UTILISE ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!!\u201d  It's useful in many contexts (I am aware of everything going on in the busy kitchen at work and can supervise multiple people at once), but sometimes it's overwhelming or there's just TOO MUCH, or in modern TV/film making they don't edit the sound well, and you really only need the relevant data.\n\nI used to put my earphones in when I was in very crowded places or at concerts, even the cinema. It would muffle everything, but it would muffle background noise more and I'd be able to hear what was relevant. Now there are earplugs specifically designed to muffle background noise. They really help with parsing audio. I have a pare of Flare Calmer, but there are other brands.\n\nIf changing the TV settings doesn't work, try sticking in some earphones or those foam earplugs and if they help you could invest in some specifically designed earplugs.", "Yeah if the volume is too loud, it genuinely hurts. Especially in action movies where the volume is unpredictable and dialogue is a whisper.\n\nI like to use the descriptive audio option on blu rays and dvds. Not only does it describe sounds and verbal cues/tones I might have missed, some of the descriptors that get used are just downright comical and make for some great meme material.", ">It\u2019s AITA, not Am I Autistic Enough for You. \n\nI'm starting to suspect this is an emotional regulation issue for you where you've gotten upset so now you're just going to keep arguing just because. Nobody is defining how autistic someone is or isn't by whether or not they can correctly define what is and isn't a stim\n\n>The tv volume was one example, but not representative of the entire issue\n\nI truly don't think you understand the purpose of this sub", "Each time you add 10 decibels I believe the noise gets multiplied by a factor of 10. But I just looked it up and 60 decibels is equivalent to normal conversation and the low end of noise produced by a hairdryer (60-95 decibels). I think any higher than 60 would be disruptive to the household.", "The worst thing in the anime world to me is when a subbed anime has subtitles wildly different from what they're actually saying. I have to turn them off, and just pay SUPER close attention to what characters are saying... which makes it impossible to watch with other people", "Ah, yes, call someone emotional so you don\u2019t actually have to consider or address what they\u2019ve said. \n\nYou\u2019ve never addressed that your whole claim that sound isn\u2019t a stim is based on a \u201cclinical definition\u201d that isn\u2019t actually in the DSM-V.", "I don\u2019t know about the volume settings, and how loud (i.e. reasonable or not) OP actually turned the tv eventually but you could also argue that OP was enjoying their living space watching television when roommates came in and started banging around in the kitchen and then holding a loud conversation, drowning out the show. \n\nNoise all the time is a different matter but in this instance it seems like a mutual annoyance of shared space issue which happens with all roommates, part of the cost of sharing space with others.", "If you use Microsoft Teams you can turn on captions for all your meetings in Settings/Accessibility", "You *are* emotional. Nothing is rational about anything you're arguing in this context because everything is based on what you think I mean vs what I actually said.\n\nEx: I didn't call you emotional. I said I suspect you have an emotional regulation issue...because you're quite literally displaying behavioral expressions of one complete with illogical reasoning.\n\nSound...quite literally...is not a stim. All autistic coping behaviors are not automatically stims. Stim is a word with a meaning. That meaning is not absolutely anything autistic people might do to soothe or self regulate. It just isn't.", "I was pointing out that you were following a common tactic of calling someone emotional to avoid responding to what they\u2019ve actually said. You used \u201cemotional regulation issue\u201d rather than emotional, but the intent is clearly the same since you immediately switched to calling me emotional (among other things) when called on it.\n\nAnd again, your claim that sound isn\u2019t a stim isn\u2019t supported by the DSM-V. \n\n1. Stims and stimming aren\u2019t mentioned or defined in the DSM-V, as quoted above.\n\n2. I\u2019ve seen reports from neuropsychologists who use repetitive and restrictive behaviors (which is what is actually mentioned in the DSM-V) around music and sound as part of their reasoning for diagnosing someone as autistic."]}
