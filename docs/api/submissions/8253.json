Anyways, NTA. First, if she is traveling that much with work, why does she have dogs? Second, and most importantly, you get to decide who, if any, you are going to look after. Your daughter (dog mom) had the luxury of you helping for 3 years, now she can find someone else to help out or pay for a sitter.", "Light NTA BUT - both your daughters have relied on you heavily for their needs. Your daughter with the dogs shouldn't be expecting you to watch her dogs constantly when she is out of town. I don't even understand the point of even having dogs (which need so much time and energy) if she's going to be out of town every week or so for 3 days on end. On the flip side, your other daughter shouldn't be relying on you as well when her and her husband work to take care of the child. What happens in the event your out of town, your sick, etc? Does she have a back up?\n\nWIth that being said, I do understand the need to prioritize your grandson over your daughter's dogs, BUT, why can't the dogs simply be kept in the basement or another room for the hours you have the child? You clearly don't have him 24h a day. I also think the no animals anywhere near the child is extremely excessive and prevents you from ever getting your own pet, in the event you would want let's say a cat.\n\nThere needs to be some form of compromise with both daughters and that needs to start from you. Set ground rules and boundaries within your own home. But ultimately it is your choice and your grandson comes before dogs (childless pet owner here).", "NTA. First of all, any decision that you make is fine, even if you decided to not watch either of them. They\u2019re not entitled to you watching their kid/pets. \n\nBesides that, I\u2019d choose a human over a pet as well (coming from a childless dog owner). \n\nYou did a perfectly fine thing imo.", "You helped her out for three years but circumstances have changed and you no longer can...even though you want to.

Would you daughter really have found other accommodations to watch the baby if you stood fast on the \"no-pets\" rule?  Doubtful.   Most animals get along well with children.  If nothing else, you can find a way to keep them apart if need be.\n\nYou chose the needs of one daughter over the other, and seem surprised that she's upset about it.   I have a feeling the daughter with child KNEW that you watched these dogs, which is precisely why she made up this rule.  You can and should, tell this child that you have reconsidered, and can't abide by the no-pets rule, so she'll have to find other accommodations when you are going to watch the dogs, or live with it.  Don't be bullied by your daughter, just because you want to see the grandchild.", "[removed]", "Nta. Minimum she got 3 years free dog watching.", "NTA. Oof, the entitlement.

It's too much on uiu to do both jobs.\n\nHaving spent time on thus sub, most posters love pets and hate young kids.

Why won\u2019t she let her child around animals? If the dogs are poorly behaved then I get it, but from the post it doesn\u2019t sound like they are. Did your older daughter know that she was putting her sister in a difficult position by doing this?", "NTA\n\nYou've helped one daughter for 3 years already, now you're stepping up and helping your other daughter, and it also serves a purpose for you, you get to spend time with your grand child.", "Nta\n\nShe had three years of free dog care and she throws a tantrum about this?  She chose to have the dogs when her job requires her to travel. That\u2019s her choice.", "Nta! Baby trumps dogs. Daycare is expensive and sometimes abusive. \n\nYou have been helping your other daughter for years, she should be more understanding but I'm guessing she thinks her dogs are just as important as her nephew. No dogs are just dogs. She can hire rover, or kennel then that's still a hell of a lot cheaper than day care. \n\nI get her initial shock but she's being selfish and spoiled", "NTA. You're correct to prioritize your grandson over your daughter's dogs. \n\nThat said, the daughter with a child is an AH. She knew you frequently watch the other sister's dogs and put this rule in there knowing it would disaffect her sister. I don't know the motivation (although I can guess), but that was absolutely inconsiderate of her to blindside your other daughter with that (she could have easily communicated her concerns to her sister and seen if there was a workable compromise). I don't blame the daughter with dogs from not talking to your AH daughter.", "NTA. It\u2019s your time, and I assume you\u2019ve never been paid for it.

Did she also think that this arrangement would last for the entire life expectancy of the dog?

She asked you about babysitting and demanded making changes to your schedule and routine in order to watch that baby. If you are doing her a favor by watching the baby, beyond basic rules (what baby eats, when they sleep, etc) she shouldn\u2019t be making demands that completely alter your life too. \n\nLastly, you get to make whatever choice you want.

It does suck for your daughter that has the dogs but it really is your choice", "NTA dogs are not people! Your daughter is acting like her dogs are the equivalent of a child! Your offer to check on them in the evenings is a perfectly reasonable compromise. She has also gotten 3 years of your help for free. If something were to happen to you tomorrow and left you unable to care for her dogs, what would she have done?", "NAH. I can understand from all perspectives here. My mom once explained to me that she tries to help everyone, but sometimes she has to go where there is the most need, and right now you need to prioritize your grandchild. This doesn't absolve you from hurt feelings, however. In your decision, you have added stress to your other daughter, but she also needs to figure it out because she knows the requirements of her job. She's had free dog sitting for years now, now she needs to find a kennel or something to help her... Her feelings are also valid.", "The needs of a 3 month old infant far outweigh and outnumber the needs of a couple of dogs. \n\nIs there a way you could have the dogs be in like, the garage or just outside while the grandson is there and not allowed in the house near the baby?\n\nPerhaps that would be a suitable compromise, but if that's not practical or possible then grandson trumps dogs for sure. \n\nNTA.", "This is suspiciously similar to another story I saw on here recently...\ud83e\udd14 that being said NTA because you told the daughter with the dogs in advance and offered another solution", "I'm going to go ahead and say NTA only because you are not obligated to do either one.  Your daughters chose to have dogs or kids.  Grandma is not responsible for either one of them, and any watching over them that you do FOR FREE is a major favor.  Your daughters are ultimately responsible for finding childcare or finding dog care as needed for their jobs.", "You know what?  Boarding for 3 days in my area is like 70 dollars a day and includes doggy day camp where my dog can play with others.  Daycare for a child M-F like 600 or more a week.\n\n\nWhile i do think that big rambunctious dogs who havent been around babies or kids, would worry me with my baby, especially when me as a new mom wasnt there,  especially with no pets at home currently. \n\n\n I do think your daughter should understand that if the proper precautions were in place (dog gate, getting a dog walker if no fenced in yard) it could be a safe environment.  If you were able to handle it and the precautions worked to keep baby safe and dogd safe, then you can help both. \n\n\nI do also however think your other daughter has reeped the benefits of free dog care for 3 years while she travels a lot for work.  If I had to travel a lot for work and didn't have someone like a spouse at home, I wouldn't have a couple dogs.  It's unfair for thr dogs to be in and out of their home all the time, and it's unfair that you have to take on the burden for God knows how long.  It's also unfair to expect you to take care of dogs And a baby.\n\n\nWith the baby, at some point will be doing to daycare, preschool/preK, and school.

Situations change, and honestly I prioritise people over dogs. You didn't spring this on your dog daughter overnight, and it's not your job to watch her dogs for her, they are your daughter's responsibility. You have every right to say you'd prefer to see a grandson.\n\nI completely understand the no animals around the baby rule too. I know that plenty of people who love dogs think they're completely fine, but I would not want to take that kind of risk with a 3 month old baby who could easily be hurt or killed by a dog who isn't in control for a second. \n\nOverall, it seems like your eldest daughter is trying to have her cake and eat it, keeping high maintenance animals like dogs, and also wanting to be out for days at a time for work. She has plenty of choices in how to deal with this, you're not the only dog sitter in the world, but you are one of that kid's few grandparents in the world.", "NTA. Things change.

They are her responsibility. \n\nI would feel the same way if you had a preference for the dogs over the baby. Your house and your choice. However, of course your daughter (dog owner) is pissed.
