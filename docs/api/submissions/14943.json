I'm also on immune suppressants because I had critically low levels of platelets (risk being you can bleed out). Having poor immunity has meant catching everything and struggling to clear the infections. I'm currently coughing/wheezing uncontrollably (until I vomit) with congestion, fever, headache and hearing loss/ear pain. The children are also sick with the same symptoms.\n\nMy husband and I moved away from our families, but my family followed me. His are spread over a 12 hour long stretch of the coast, but some are within an hour drive. They go years without talking to each other and make no effort with things like birthdays and Christmas. \n\nRecently, his paternal grandmother died. It was not unexpected, but the woman raised him for a few years during his parents divorce. He adores her, but still went approximately 15 years without talking to her - until his father told him she was terminally ill, prompting a single visit last year.\n\nThe funeral was held approximately 10 hours away from our home. I knew it was important to him so I agreed he could travel down there, despite struggling with the kids. He refused to give me a return date, but has decided to return home today. He was away for four days, which is fairly reasonable.\n\nWhen he told me he was coming home, he said he would be dropping his brother off in a town between ours and his maternal grandmother along the way. I thought that would make his trip home longer, but if he's up for that, fine.\n\nTurns out he's actually bringing his brother directly to our house. He said he may get picked up tomorrow, but how long he stays shouldn't be an issue anyway because it's his brother.\n\nNow, his brother is in his mid thirties and  (although he's good natured) he is a bum. He never finished school or enrolled in further education, never got a licence, never had a job or a relationship. He has been sponging off their maternal grandmother  (who is nearly 90) since he was kicked out of home. His days are filled with gaming and nothing else. No goals in life, rarely even leaves the house, he's just happy to be a sponge. \n\nI should mention that the reason his brother is needing to come up here. Last year she won a multi-million dollar waterfront apartment which she had to live in for a full year before she could sell it. She sold it about a month ago, but for the last year, his brother had been living in her old house alone (and not maintaining it). She is now selling that house and he wants to live in her new home. He has never had to use public transport so he is unwilling to travel by any means other than a car.\n\nTL;DR \n\nAITA for being angry that my husband is bringing his sponge of a brother to our home - and lying, telling me he was dropping him off on the way home - when myself and the kids are unwell and with no guarantee of when he will leave?", "created_utc": 1681630250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nzsel/aita_for_being_angry_that_my_32f_husband_40m_is/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And now your husband brings in basically another child without asking you! \n\nI would be livid. He needs an ultimatum or he might never leave!", "NTA\n\nYou should be angry about the brother. You should be angry about your husband\u2019s unwillingness to give you a return date (seriously, WTF?). You should be angry about him making all these decisions solo then informing you of them (when he can be bothered) instead of making them together.\n\nHis brother could be the ideal houseguest and this scenario would still be 100% not okay. You and your children are sick. You have two newborns. You have been on your own for four days in that situation, during your birth recovery period. The last thing your house needs is yet another person in it.\n\nWishing you and your children a full recovery. Soon.", "Girl barricade the door! How is this super clear cut situation coming up so much on Reddit lately? Stop  with the surprise roommates, people! NTA", "Totally NTA. It\u2019s not only your husband\u2019s house, and you \u2014with three babies no less! \u2014 definitely have a say on who is invited as a guest. You need to nip this in the bud now, before he becomes a legal tenant and you have to evict him. Bums never, ever leave on their own. And if he\u2019s there for 30 days in most jurisdictions, he\u2019s no longer a guest, but a tenant. Get him out now!", "NTA. You are immuno compromised, struggling to get yourself well whilst also taking care of 2 newborns and a toddler who are also all sick.\n\nNow, not only does your husband leave you and the children for an unspecified length of time. He also brings another person back with him, into the house filled with people with weak immune systems, and not only does he not have the manners to tell you beforehand, he actually lies to you about it.\n\nYou were right to be upset at this.", "Make sure your husband is the one that has to entertain, feed, and clean up after his brother. He's HIS guest, not yours (since you weren't even consulted about it). And this is all IN ADDITION TO taking care of the kids all by himself. He knew he needed to give you a break when he got back. I don't know why he would pile his plate with even more, but he did. \n\nMaybe leave to visit your parents for 4 days (without kids), or until the brother leaves. Make sure the house is in the same condition as when your husband came home before you come back. There shouldn't be piles of dishes or loads of laundry. He can wash sheets and make beds, or learn how.\n\nEdit: NTA!", "Change the locks. Tell your husband that he can either drop off his brother wherever he wants to go before he can enter the home. \n\nOnce he returns, have trusted family or friends around and have a good hard long conversation with your husband about responsibility and boundaries. \n\nDon't just be annoyed and angry, act upon it. Under no circumstance should you let your brother in law enter the house. There's no way he'll leave once he gains entry.\n\nNTA", "NTA. At what point exactly is it, that you become worthy of help and support in your husband's eyes????", "None of the extra details you've given really matter.... Like, fine he isn't a brilliant guy, but ultimately, he's your husband's brother, is putting your foot down when it sounds like he is on the way already, really worth the agro? Your husband was selfish in what he has done, but rather than letting it blow up the relationship, simply give him some rules, brother only stays 1-2 days, your husband is fully involved with helping you with the kids and allowing you time to rest because you're unwell, this isn't just down time with his brother, you've been alone with them for 4,days, you need a break and to get better. \n\nYour NTA, your husband should have talked to you beforehand, but is it really worth having a big argument about. Just let him know there are conditions to the brother staying and make it crystal clear.", "NTA. Aaaaand the brother will never leave", "It makes a lot of sense about being immune compromised and recovering from C-section you don\u2019t want people in your home.\n\nIt is just that your husband didn\u2019t choose for his grandmother to die, life can become chaos. And if he was in a car for several hours with his brother will commingle germs already\u2026\n\nNot every family is like your family, you are being pretty judgmental of what your husband should feel. \n\nNTA for worrying he won\u2019t leave, tho.", "That's a whole lot throwing a guy under the bus for reasons that don't have to do with the actual conflict.\n\nYour husband doesn't seem to fully understand the gravity of you being immunosuppressed. As sucky as the situation is for your BIL, now it isn't the time.\n\nNTA being upset he's brought in the home, especially with the hubby misleading you (probably knowing you would say no unless the brother was plopped in the home already).", "op=NTA\n\nbut I get the impression hubby always does what he wants and can't be arsed to respect your needs or wishes.\n\nCan you stay with family for a few weeks while you recover? Otherwise you'll end up having to wait on BIL's lazy arse.", "NTA, but neither are they. This is multiple stressful and difficult situations at the same time.
