{"id": 14635, "submission_id": "12jwyq5", "title": "AITA for telling my mom's boyfriend she only wants his money?", "selftext": "My mom (38) has been dating her current boyfriend (50's) since last September. I (24M) have only met him a few times because I live a few hours from my family and haven't had much interest in spending time with him. \n\nMy mom has 5 other kids (21M, 17M, 15F, 14F, 5M) and her boyfriend has 2 adult kids. \n\nThe boyfriend is fairly well off and lives in a large house by himself. My mom in the past has dated wealthier men explicitly for their money. She married her 2nd husband because she was dating him when another man got her pregnant (with 17M) and she passed him off as his son so he would marry her. Several of her boyfriends since her 2nd divorce she has dated for their money and has literally told me while she was dating them that's why she was with them. \n\nMy mom has expressed to me that this guy is different and that she likes him a lot. Despite this she has him spending a lot of money on her and my siblings and has admitted he's paid some of her bills. I don't judge my mom for dating men for their money if they are only dating her for her looks. She hasn't had it easy in life and has struggled to provide for all us kids over the years.\n\nI decided to spend the long weekend visiting my mom and siblings. I ended up chatting with her boyfriend and he mentioned that he and my mom had talked about her and the kids moving into his house as he has the space and it's going to waste. I don't think this is a great idea for several reasons. For one thing they haven't been dating that long and she doesn't know him well enough. If they then break up my mom is going to be scrambling for a new place to live with all the kids. My childhood was unstable because my mom bounced around with different men and made me move frequently, not just around the same area but different states as well. I don't want my mom to jeopardise the stability she's created for the last 7 or so years, for something that won't last. My siblings seem to like the boyfriend and he is one of the best men my mom has dated (which isn't saying much) and there are some other upsides for her moving in with him but they don't outweigh my concerns. I also feel bad for this man, he seems like a nice enough person and to an extent my mom is just using him.\n\nWhen he brought up moving, I asked him if he wasn't concerned that my mom was only dating him for his money and what he can provide her. He asked me if that's what I think is happening and I said yes. He told me he that was my opinion. At some point he must have told my mom what I said. She was upset and confronted me. We ended up arguing and I decided to leave.\n\nLater my brothers called me to ask about what happened between me and mom. They thought I was an asshole for saying our mom was a gold digger even though they both also agreed that she was clearly dating him for his money.

Believe me, plenty of rich guys know what their money gets them and they\u2019re cool with that. You don\u2019t need to stick your nose into their relationship", "Yta but I sympathise. You're trying to care for your siblings. \n\nBut. Your mam gets to date whoever she wants for whatever motives. This man isn't a child and I assume wasn't born yesterday. If he has money, then he's used to being used for it. He knows what it looks like. Maybe he uses that money to date younger women. That's his decision. \n\nYou also don't know this relationship. There's every chance your mother loves him. There's every chance he loves her and your siblings. You don't get to make these calls.", "YTA. Your mother told you differently and you disregarded that and possibly ruined her relationship.\n\nI can't imagine a world in which you're not the AH.\n\nIt sounds like maybe you resent her for your unstable childhood, which you have a right to do, but you should work that out in therapy rather than sabotaging her relationship.", "YTA - you said in the past that your mother had outright told you she was using this or that man for money but this time she told you she really likes this man. You admit he seems to be decent. Why would you sabotage that? You had it rough growing up, are you jealous some of your siblings might have a better life than you?", "Yta it\u2019s none of your business why they\u2019re dating and to say it\u2019s not going to last is uncalled for. You never know when it will be the right person. How can you expect stability when you go out of your way to ruin it?", "YTA.  It's his decision whether to date your mom or not.  \n\nPeople date for all kinds of reasons, maybe money is a factor but it's certainly not up to you to be giving your opinion when nobody asked you and it doesn't affect you negatively.", "YTA\n\nIts not your business to tell your mothers boyfriend anything. You should've talked to your mom instead", "YTA\nYour mom tells you that she really likes him and you try to ruin her relationship. It's not your job to punish your mother for her past love live.", "It costs exactly zero dollars to mind your own business.  Yta", "YTA,\n\nThat's none of your business and you contradict yourself a ton in your post, first you understand she hasn't had it easy, then you say she's told you this guy's different and she likes him, and now you think you can judge her and tell him about this? What're you playing at?\n\nWhatever her reasoning is it's none of your business, you're 24, go live your life and leave your mother and minor siblings alone.\n\nAlso, your mom's been having kids since she was 14 and stopped having them 5 years ago and you still wanna add on top of that?! As long as it doesn't affect you why do you care? she has a whole set of kids to take care of, and you don't mention helping her.", "This sounds like a Jerry Springer episode. Leave them to their mess. You ain\u2019t changing it no matter what you say.", "Your mom was 14 when she had you? Is that a typo?", "Yta the hell are you doing inserting yourself into someone else's relationship?", "YTA \n\nyou don\u2019t have any business interfering in your moms relationship. that\u2019s way out of line.", "Going against the mainstream - NTA\n\nNormally I'd say y t a, however, given the entirety of the circumstances and your (and your many siblings) experience growing up, I can absolutely not fault you for voicing your concern as the eldest child. They've only been together 6 months, and she has a documented and repeating history of these kinds of things. Hopefully this time is different, but you're certainly not an AH for saying what you said.\n\nHope it does work out this time for everyone, though.", "YTA...stop meddling in other people's business. It's time to live your own life and lead by example.", "I know you are trying to help out your siblings and bring them stability and your mom is now risking that. But what if she honestly does care for him? Maybe you should talk to her directly about it and be upfront about your feelings. Maybe she needs to hear that the instability she brought you, shouldn't be repeated. \n\nBut, YTA because no matter her past, she deserves a chance at happiness if she truly has feelings for this guy.", "YTA. You really going off on your mom's part relationships as a reason to tell her new boyfriend you believe she's only with him for the money? Stay out of it!", "Nta, you tried to save a guy from being taken advantage of. You are an honest person and the world needs more of you!", "I\u2019m on the fence. Yeah it was inappropriate to call her out like that, but I really don\u2019t like the idea of kids moving in with some strange man who will probably be temporary, so I get where you\u2019re coming from.", "YTA.\n\nYou're a grown man. Mommy's relationships are none of your business.", "You overstepped, big time. Only the two of them can know what attracts them to each other. You can't read either of their minds; although your mom already told you she's really into this guy and he's \"different\", meaning she sees something special in him. Presumably it's mutual, or else he wouldn't be offering her and your siblings a home. You need to MYOB on this one.", "YTA, I understand where you\u2019re coming from but you definitely could\u2019ve been more sensitive all around. You didn\u2019t indicate any reason for disliking him other than past trauma, so I say you have some things to work on brother. Specifically with your mother. Good luck with your situation", "NTA you sound like a good person and you\u2019re sick of your mom\u2019s shit. If he continues to date her, that\u2019s on him. But you can rest knowing you were honest. You did it to protect your siblings.", "YTA.  If you had concerns about your mom moving in (totally valid) you should have spoken to your mom about it.  You have admitted you aren't around, don't see the relationship, and that she has told you he is different.  I'm not saying your assumptions are wrong, but you should have kept it to yourself.  \n\nNot your circus, not your monkeys.  \n\nStay out of your mom's love life.", "YTA, yikes, my dude, I hope you get some help, you have some longer term issues to resolve.", "YTA- His money makes him attractive to your mom just like her age is probably attracting to him. Newsflash- looking for financial stability in the people you chose to date is a commonsense practice. Your mother has children, why would she waste her time with a man who would not be able to support the family if the relationship were to get that serious? Get your head out of your ass!", "YTA.  You could have expressed your concerns Olinda a different way, knowing she had told you that she really like him.\nSo your reasons are logical, but you could have just expressed concerns at the speed without jumping straight to gold digger.", "YTA - you really seem to dislike your mother, which is fine but trying to sabotage her relationships is not fine. If you have issues you need to work through, get a therapist.", "He\u2019s a wealthy 50 year old man.  He knows what\u2019s up. YTA.", "Sorry man YTA\n\nYou would have been better off warning your siblings about what could happen more than her BF about your mom's intentions that you aren't sure are even true", "YTA because your mom told you this time is different, all the siblings like him, and he is the best guy she's dated so far. Despite knowing all this, you still decided to shit on her.  Stay a few hours away and let her get on with her life and keep your nose out of her business. You say yourself she hasn't had it easy, so when she gets her chance, why try and ruin it for her?", "YTA.  Not your business.  Stay out of it.", "I don't think YTA at all.  You told the truth.\n\nSorry but your mother isn't a stable person.  She uses men for their money and lies to them.  These relationships are transactional.  Sex for money.\n\nYour mom had you at 14!  That's a child having a child!  The next at 17, then another at 20.  So she doesn't learn from her mistakes.  At an age where she should have been in school or working she's having children with multiple partners.  Her kids don't have a stable home life, being uprooted and moving around to chase after these men, friendships lost, changing schools more than once.\n\nThen she lies to her second husband and passes off another man's kid as her own.  That's outrageous!   \n\nSo if your motivations were, as you said, to warn this guy off so your siblings don't get uprooted again when the relationship doesn't work out  then you were doing the right thing.  Were you sticking your nose into somebody else's business?  Yes.  But you did it to protect your younger siblings.\n\nThe minute your mother gets older and can't attract rich guys anymore, she and the kids will really be up the creek.", "Yes you are TA", "Ok but she is a gold digger lmfao \ud83e\udd23", "I\u2019m going agains the grain and saying NTA. \n\nThis feels like a question regarding your own morals more than anything. \n\nYour empathy for this man, your principles on who is deserving of being dated for their money, and your concern about a situation that will affect your siblings was at odds with your loyalty for your mom and the financial benefits this arrangement would provide your family. \n\nBoth choices have their own merits and associated guilt. You had to make a choice and you chose to share your thoughts. \n\nWe make the decisions we can live with and deal with the consequences of those decisions. \n\n\nNow, to address the actual actions that took place. \nAs others have mentioned, if this man had money, he has probably considered that people might date him for the money. You weren\u2019t telling him anything he hadn\u2019t already considered. \n\nWhen he asked you for your opinion on the situation, you gave an honest answer without going into all the details why you think that. \n(It doesn\u2019t sound like you aired all of your moms dirty laundry. If you had, then I doubt his reply would have been \u201cwell that\u2019s your opinion\u201d.)\n\nThe thing is, he\u2019s correct that it is your opinion. Your opinion as his girlfriend\u2019s son carries some weight and it sounds like he is taking it into consideration. However, now you\u2019ve said your piece and shouldn\u2019t push the issue. If he still decides to date your mom, then that is 100% on him. \n\nAt this point, the moral balance I mentioned above has changed. The only reason left on the \u201cintervene\u201d side is your concern for your siblings getting into this situation. Perhaps you still weigh that highly enough to do more, but I would caution you to be clear-eyed about the consequences. That would pretty much require you to actively and deliberately undermine this relationship and likely ruin your own relationship with your family in the process. \n\nPersonally, I would back off at this point and let things play out as they may. If your biggest concern is for your siblings, then I would argue that the best outcome is the one where you are still in their lives once the dust settles.", "YTA wow the stupidity and entitlement. Your mom deserves better than you. Wtf wtf wtf", "NTA you call it like you see it", "YTA It is none of your business. Familial loyalty should be something that you consider before betraying your mom. There are many reasons that couples live together beyond being in love. Some people genuinely like each other and want companionship. Some people don't like being single and settle rather than waiting for that one great love. Others get together for financial or practical reasons.", "NTA for wanting your siblings to have the stability you never did.", "NTA to the boyfriend, but YTA for your mom. Honestly, two sides of the same coin.", "Jesus Lord, your mum had you when she was 14. Oh my days..", "This is not the popular opinion but I\u2019m going with NAH\n\nNo it\u2019s not you business who your mom is dating but I believe you said what you did in order to protect your siblings. You don\u2019t want them to have the life you did. Could you have handled it better? Probably but the fact that your mom and siblings could be potentially homeless and you would ( more than likely) have to pitch in or even take them in gives me the impression of you trying to protect your family.", "NTA- he asked you for your opinion. Are you supposed to lie?", " NTA", "NTA you gave the opinion to the bf. He can't say he wasn't aware...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds stupid and sometimes cruel. But yes. Because it's not just her mom, it's her siblings, too. She has a 5 year old sibling.
