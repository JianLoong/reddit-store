Not like Eddie is some super unique name, and she's the one that refused to tell anyone the name. what is the worst thing that's gonna happen? you call out the kids name at a family event and both the kid *and* the dog come over to you? the horror!", "Pretty obvious NTA. She didn't tell you the name before you got the dog. There will generally be no confusion between if you're talking about a dog or a baby when talking to others. I don't even know what constitutes a \"bad uncle\" since you aren't actively harming the child. You don't owe someone else's baby priority over your household.\n\nJust say no and if she keeps insisting, change the subject or end the conversation. \"We discussed this and I said no\" is more than enough.", "NTA\n\nOur adopted dog is Sonny\n\nSo is the neighbours child\n\nYou better believe when I yell out the door\n\n\u2018Sonny!

You publicly named him first. Sister could have gave you a heads up and told you to not reveal the kids name.", "NTA and its not like they have copyrighted the name. Tell them that your dog is like a child to you and that you are keeping the name. Also Eddie and Edward are two different names and its not like you did it on purpose or out of vengeance.", "NTA- since you aren't a mind reader you had no idea. And yes many people wont even think of the dog or the baby when using the name.  I had a cat with the same name as my cousin, never was an issue!", "NTA.\n\nIt's weird when people take a claim on a name, especially for a pretty generic name that many kids likely have as well. Plus its not like you purposely stole the name and knew about it anyways. What a weird hill to die on.", "NTA.  I can get your sister having a \"hang on a minute\" moment but it really isn't a big deal if she really thinks about it.\n\nWhat does she think is going to happen, family meeting at yours, banging on the dog bowl with food \"Eddie!  Eddie!  Dinner time\" and the toddler bounds over and starts eating dog food?\n\n\"Mommy, mommy, am I a dog?\"  \"No son, you're not\"  \"Why do I have the name of a dog?\"\n\nIt's all a bit silly.", "NTA . But your Sister is for thinking she owns the copyright to the name.", "NTA you didn't know as she refused to tell you the name.", "My dogs have human names and my eldest has a common dog name (don't worry, it's not Spot or anything, it's just an out of vogue name as a human). It never occurred to me to bother caring what other people named their dogs.\n\nThough I suppose if I has always known what I would name my kid, then someone names their dog it when I was pregnant when they knew that was my always my plan, I'd be miffed... but that's not the case here.\n\nGlad the kid and dog has a name everyone likes.\n\nNTA\n\nJust don't joke she named her kid after her dog.

No there won\u2019t be confusion but you\u2019re stressing your pregnant sister out over something that has no impact on you and means something to her.\n\nMany couples don\u2019t share names because people like the name and scoop in up (Seinfeld and a child named Seven). Considering your feelings about the dog name, you seem like the type who would have stolen the name for your kid if you were having one.\n\nJust change the dog\u2019s name to Teddy.", "NTA - honestly it's at least a halfway reasonable concern for her to not want her kid sharing a name with your dog. They'll probably be together a bit through your dog's life, and the timing makes it a bit awkward, especially with you announcing first. That isn't your fault either, I just think it's a reasonable request.\n\nIt's also a reasonable request to turn down and where she lost me is in calling you a bad uncle.", "Nta. \n\nShe doesn't get to decide what names other people can't use.", "Just tell her to nickname her son Ted.\n\nNTA.", "NTA With the Adams Family being remade, they might do the Munsters next and then everyone will think that she named him after Eddie Munster.", "NTA\n\nYou can name your pet whatever you like. \n\nSide note: I also love human names for pets.

When I remarried I wanted my kids to be part of the wedding party so I took them shopping for some dressy clothes. There was this one adorable dress that came with a doll wearing the same dress in miniature. I thought he would really like that but he refused and started crying (he was 6). \n\nIt took a few minutes to get him to tell me what was wrong and when he did he told me he thought people would mistake him for a doll. There was a certain little-kid logic to it! So we got another dress........ But op is NTA", "Nah, why would he have to use code? The only person making it awkward is the sister. It is her problem, and nobody else should have to deal with it.", ">Considering your feelings about the dog name, you seem like the type who would have stolen the name for your kid if you were having one\n\nlol what?", "There's one on every AITA post", "I just pictured a glitter baby with fangs now.

He did some therapy when he was still a pretty little kid and it helped so much. He's an extraordinarily self aware adult now. And _much_ better about communicating! I'm so proud of all my kids."]}
