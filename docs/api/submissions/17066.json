What gives anyone the right to make such a demand?  \n\nSo what, the name is the same.....big deal, who cares?  And then to demand a name change?  Absolutely not.  It's silly and insulting to you.    NTA", "NTA. Edward/Eddie is such a common name that chances are the kid will run into a few other Eddies throughout their life. Also, I don\u2019t really want to bring this up but a dogs lifespan is much shorter so it\u2019s not like some thing that would be a permanent problem.", "NTA I would love to be named after a pupper.", "if i were you i'd spitefully refuse to refer to your nephew as eddie. he'd be edward, edson, edison, el dente, elephant, ellen degeneres, elijah, elliot, etcetera, echolocation, so on and so forth until your sister stops bugging you about the dog", "NTA. The risk of picking a simple name like this is that people will name their pets the same. It's not like you stole the name from your sister to name your dog that way.", "There are a lot of nicknames for Edward\u2026", "We have a Harry Dog and our friends kid is Harry Hooman, no one cares. *Dog is older", "Buy your nephew a necklace with a matching tag...win-win. Seriously, don't sweat it. Very few children end up with the nickname their parents envision for them. My oldest, Teagan, ended up with \"Tank.\"", "The dog on Frazier was named Eddie, wasn't he?", "NTA. Is she going to freak out anytime her son comes across another child named Eddie? She\u2019s being ridiculous.", "NTA !! I mean did you have a crystal ball to see what name was picked so you can name your puppy that ? Like what ? You didn\u2019t know ! She didn\u2019t want to give the name til birth, you picked a name for your new puppy! Sounds like a her problem not a you problem! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it\u2019s very stupid ..", "NTA. I mean I don\u2019t think this should really be a big deal.  OP didn\u2019t intentionally give his dog the same name as her son. He independently picked a name he liked, and he didn\u2019t know it was also going to be his nephew\u2019s name. I don\u2019t think this should be a problem. And I don\u2019t think OP has the change the dog\u2019s name just because it\u2019s the same as the child\u2019s name. It might be kind of fun in a way, the kid might bond with this dog over the shared name.", "NTA.\n\nalso it's a massive peeve of mine when people name their kids something and then go \"but we'll call them a nickname\"... just make their legal name the nickname then ffs.", "Deffo NTA. However, in a situation like this, especially with it being your sister, I think it's best to just change the dog's name. As others have said you've only just got it anyway and its not worth falling out over.", "NTA. Your sister can get over herself. \n\nAnd not gonna lie, my brain went to Ed, Edd, and Eddy..  \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "NTA, you didn\u2019t know. My sister named her kids after her siblings dogs. People name kids weird shit all the time.", "NTA. \nFind yourself a new sister. Your current one has more entitlement than brain cells. You don\u2019t need that in your life.", "NTA - She refused to disclose the name your not a mind reader", "She needs to get a grip! Our cat is Jess (like Postman Pats cat), and 3 years later our niece was born and also named Jess... It's not quite the crisis situation your sister is making it out to be.", "Our rescue dog was Neddy, we dropped the N and made it Eddy to avoid a name conflict. Maybe you could do the opposite and add the N. Not that you need to cuz clearly the dog came first but honestly sometimes it\u2019s just easier and the dog won\u2019t notice \ud83d\ude05.", "NTA, notice how OPs sister didn\u2019t offer to replace extensive custom dog gear. Kind of the reason why people discuss a list of names they might choose with close family, to avoid this (albeit usually with other new babies). Also, dibs. If you got there first and that changes how they feel about the name, they need to change names. Similar if a mass-murderer called Eddie popped up in your town. Not your problem.", "Nta", "NTA. One can be \u201cbaby Eddie\u201d and the other can be \u201cgood boy Eddie\u201d.", "My \"friend\" named her dog the same as my nickname and pretended that she did not know it. There are worse people out there.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nNoone can own a first name.\n\nIf four legged Eddie is around long enough for little two leg Eddie to understand they have the same name, he'll probably get a kick out of it.\n\nTell sis to chill.", "My son and my dog have the same name! Jack!\nWe adopted the dog at 10yrs old and considered changing his name but my son (11yrs) loves having the same name.\nSometimes it's confusing but most times not a problem.", "Our dog was named Nikko and my cousin was nicknamed Nico (Nicholas). They had a laugh and moved on.\n\nMy aunt and I have the same last 5 letters and not normal age differences. We have fun introducing ourselves.\n\nIt happens. The kids won't care.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. We named our puppy Sophia and then my sister decided to name her daughter Sophia and she didn\u2019t care at all. She actually got more upset when we found out our cousin was naming her daughter Sophia despite my sister already having chosen the name. It\u2019s a puppy not another baby. And I guarantee that kid will love it.", "NTA\n\nBut to keep the peace, change the pups name to Theodore, or Eddie for short", "Obvious NTA, but you're so sister is pregnant so people on this sub will take pitty on her and tell you change the name. Don't listen to these people. Keep the name and tell your sister to get over herself.", "NTA , my dog is named a male human name too. \nI once dated a guy with the same name. He couldn\u2019t really get used to me sternly calling his name when we would go for hikes together.\n\nWe didn\u2019t work out, not sure if that was the problem", "NTA. You hit the name first. We have human in our family with the same names.", "NTA, obviously you don't have to do anything.", "We have this exact thing with my nephew. I got my dog Ed, and he was already named. Then my sister had my nephew and called him Edward. \n\nIt was a complete non-issue. No one cares that they have similar names. Nephew goes by Ted anyway.\n\nNo one confuses the basset hound with the child, and Ted quite likes having a dog in the family with a similar name!", "NTA because your intention wasn\u2019t to screw with your sister. Although if it were me and my sister asked me to change the name of my dog I\u2019d do it in a second because my sisters feelings will always be there whereas a dog will forget and respond to any name said by a familiar", "NTA it\u2019s not your problem that she didn\u2019t tell people what she was going to name the baby. Call her kid Eddie the human when it\u2019s born", "You are totally NTA. And I'm sure Eddie is a very good boy, who should keep his name.", "NTA and your right it's kinda stupid.  I'm really curious to know how long your sister has thought you've had amazing mind reading capabilities?  You named Eddie first and she needs to get over herself.", "I actually named my dog after my dad's first name, nobody has mixed those two up yet...(I  hope O_O, runs to go check his dinner plate)", "Just a thought, I know an Edward, he\u2019s 18months old and his parents call him Ned and it\u2019s super cute!", "NTA.  Let there be two Eddies.", "NTA IF ONLY SHE TOLD YOU WHAT THE NAME WAS GOING TO BE IT COULD BE AVOIDED", "NTA I share my name with a spaniel.  A dog and a boy can both be called 'Eddie'.", "My friend gave her new born chick the same name as me. I think it's cute. I don't give a f#ck. Eddie won't either. I didn't tell her to change the chicken's name. It is awfully cute though \ud83d\ude00", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t own the name and she can still call her son Eddie. Give Ed a big pat on the head because he is absolutely a good boi.", "NTA-and don\u2019t change his name either!my sister did the same when I had my kid,got angry because she wanted to use a name with the same meaning I chose for my kid,she\u2019s never even been pregnant..just entitled!no one can own a name,there will be hundreds of kids and dogs out there with the same name,has she contacted them and informed them they\u2019ll have to change?!ignore her,very pathetic", "NTA", "Agreed, and human baby Eddie will probably think it's cute and funny that he shares a name with a dog friend :) Let your sister know you really hope the two of you have fun with the situation. NTA.", "Oh and NTA, but not wise with your battles.", "When you know it's not gonna end well but \ud83c\udf7f"]}
