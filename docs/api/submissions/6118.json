I have no interest and firmly told her no and set up a boundary that i didn't want to be pressured into doing religious stuff.  I told her i would respect her religion but if she wants a catholic partner i am not the right person.  \n\nI am not a huge football fan but generally watch the packers every sunday with friends as a hanging out thing.  My gf still upset over me not going to mass, declared sunday to be a tv free day so we could have a long discussion about christ and our future.  She hid the power cord to my tv.  I was really angry and firmly told her she needed to obey me because the bible said she had to submit to me.  It was supposed to be sarcastic and a dumb thing to say.  She finally gave the cord back after many tears and screams about how I wasn't even willing to try being a christian for her.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
