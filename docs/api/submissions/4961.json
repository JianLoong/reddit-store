If I do anything wrong please tell me.\n\nI(70s F) am the grandmother to 5 wonderful grandkids (3 women and 2 men). The last of my grandkids got married last October. My husband (70s M) and I usually get them a small gift (usually the cheapest thing on the registry), then the day before the wedding, we privately gift them a check for $40k, we prefer that they use it for a house, but we don\u2019t force them to do so. We also ask them to keep it private (we have a big extended family, and we don\u2019t want them to expect it from us). They all honored this request.\n\nWhen it came to our youngest granddaughter, we bought her an air fryer (that was the cheapest thing on the registry) and sent it in advance. Then she called us furious, she went off on us for being cheap and how she knew we had money, but that we did not love her enough to show it by getting her something more expensive.\n\nWe were horrified by her behavior, then she went ahead and threatened to disinvite us if we didn\u2019t get her a better gift. We discussed it, bought her a China set, but we did not give her the money that was set aside for her. We decided that she did not deserve it.\n\nFast foreword to last week, she met up with her brother, they got to talking and she found out about the cash gift that he got. She asked her cousins and found out all of them got the same gift. She called us furious for discriminating against her. We told her that it was our money, and after how she behaved, we did not want to give it to her.\n\nShe started crying, said that she was just extremely stressed, and that we shouldn\u2019t have taken it to heart. We told her that we stand by our decision. Now she is refusing to attend Christmas, and her mother (our DIL) is calling us AHs.

That\u2019s not stress, that\u2019s spoiled. And her mother backing her up shows why she is spoiled.\n\nIf she\u2019d apologised BEFORE finding out about the money, then you might\u2019ve believed that her remorse was been real\u2026. But she didn\u2019t. \n\nShe called you \u2018furious\u2019 once she found out - trying to force you to give her more AGAIN. Then tried tears to manipulate you. Now, with no wedding to blame her behaviour on, she\u2019s refusing to come to events until you cough up the cash. \n\nGuess you know what value she puts on her grandparents. She\u2019s entitled, spoiled and rude.", "[removed]", "NTA. I would never DREAM of criticizing a gift, never mind coming from a family member. I\u2019m horrified at her behavior. And her doubling down and wanting to not attend Christmas? I\u2019d stay with the decision. If she had apologized profusely and then let it go I might have gifted the original money on their one year anniversary. But her continued tantrum, no. She does not deserve it acting like an entitled spoiled brat.", "NTA.\n\nShe bit your hand and expected you to feed her afterward? *Hell* no. \n\nShe threatened to *uninvite* you over an *Air Fryer*. If she'd just been Grateful or Graceful, she'd have gotten exactly what she was screaming at you about wanting. But no, she couldn't even *feign* composure, and tried to bully you into giving her what she wanted. \n\nIt's not even like you got her something that wasn't on the registry, she just thought she was entitled to your money. Sucks to be her, she gets less now because she threatened you, who the money belongs to. \n\nThis'll be a hard lesson for her, maybe, but it's one that seems to be well overdue, and it's one she needs to learn.", "NTA.\n\nI agree with your decision to withhold that check and I probably would have done the exact same thing if I were in your position.\n\nThe fact that she views you only as a cash cow and wouldn't even want you to attend her wedding UNLESS you forked over a check sounds like extortion. It shows that she only values you for the money she thinks that she can get from you. It's a disgusting way to treat a supposed loved one. \n\nInteresting that instead of apologizing and acknowledging what she did was wrong she chose the manipulative route instead: crying and claiming she wasn't serious. Most likely because this approach probably got her what she wanted as a child. By giving her the check now you would be enabling this atrocious behavior.", "NTA. Calling anyone to complain about a gift is stupid. Your granddaughter has no manners. Just because someone has money doesn't mean they are obligated to give some to you. I am sorry she turned a happy occasion into a s#itshow.", "NTA she's not sorry. She's just sorry she got caught. I can't in a million years ever imagine being this disrespectful to anybody, especially my grandmother. Why does wealth turn people into such AHs?", "NTA\n\nAnd her mother should be ashamed for not raising a daughter with manners. Maybe if she\u2019d been taught that throwing a toddler tantrum didn\u2019t result in her getting her way, this could have been avoided.  \n\nBut then there\u2019s the entitlement. Sigh.", "[removed]", "NTA.  Your first gift option was an air fryer and then a check (at the wedding).  She emphatically told you that she wanted a more expensive gift from her registry instead.  You did that with the purchase of the china set.  She got what she asked for.  All she had to do was show grace which she is incapable of; in reddit land \u201cshe fucked around and found out\u201d and where I come from we call your granddaughter a \u201csmacked ass\u201d.", "I applaud you.  These are hard lessons but she also sounds like a slow learner.  \n\nUnfortunately, this will probably divide your family as your daughter is taking her side.  \n\nI hope you don\u2019t cave in.  \n\nEven if she were stressed, that is no way to speak to you.  She needs to learn to take a step back and breathe before speaking her mind.", "NTA.\n\nAlso can I just say\u2026an air fryer was the CHEAPEST thing on the registry? Don\u2019t those things *start* at around a hundred dollars? I mean\u2026was she just assuming everyone would have to pony up just to come to the wedding? (This whole thing is just very strange to me. I didn\u2019t even *know* what people got me until *after* my wedding.)", "NTA, she deserved that. Stress doesn't make you blatantly disrespect someone you love and act like an entitled brat. If she was unhappy about the gift, she could've just shut up and put up with it. You value the people for who they are, not what they can give you.", "NTA. She was horrible to you. Actions have consequences.", "NTA. Those are the life lessons that I love. She was rude to you and she acted entitled. She now has to deal with the consequences of her actions.", "NTA - she was extremely entitled going off on you guys for getting her a cheap gift. She should have been gracious and thank you profusely for even getting her a gift. Just going to say I don't have any plans getting married but I absolutely will take your gift, the air fryer and the check haha. Honestly you did nothing wrong and the granddaughter is not necessarily being discriminated against, she's just acting entitled", "NTA, nobody deserves that kind of financial help after being so rude and disrespectful. Also, if you're DiL is so pissed about the whole thing *she* can give them 40k, after all, if she'd raised her daughter to be more polite to begin with this situation wouldn't have occurred \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "My grandmother was my only grandparent left when I got married.  The fact that she was AT my wedding was gift enough.  The utter gall of your granddaughter just makes me ill.  She does not deserve your generosity; I don't think I'd ever be able to get over it.  She won't be a great loss at Christmas and her mother should stay and keep her company.  They can be hateful together and not ruin anybody else's holiday.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your choice of gift is entirely up to you. You were nicer than I, since I wouldn't have given her a china set.", "NTA  Your granddaughter demanded you give her  a better gift so in addition to the air fryer, you gifted her a china set. She never apologized and explained she was stressed until she found out that you had gifted your other grand children money in addition to the cheapest thing on the registry. Your finances are no one's business but your own. No one is entitled to monetary gifts.", "NTA, if your granddaughter would have simply been grateful she would have gotten what everyone else did.", "Reddit has plenty of cases of the grandparents having to tell their grandchildren no for the first time in their life, so you are not alone. \n\nGood on ya for not giving in to her entitlement. Sorry that your DIL and son failed your grandchild. You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nEntitlement and disrespect has consequences.", "Nta. She had no grace. How embarrassing for her.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nShe sounds spoiled enough, no need to spoil her more. \n\nLet her miss Christmas, she\u2019ll learn eventually.", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to inheritance/gift money that isn\u2019t currently being offered/given to them.", "NTA\n\nI have secondhand embarrassment for her. The absolute gall of someone to call and complain about a gift, DEMAND another, and then call and complain AGAIN and demand another again. I\u2019m horrified.", "NTA. the fact that your DIL is calling you AH shows how your grand daughter was brought up. Hopefully this lesson teaches both of them to be more polite.", "[removed]", "Nta. You planned to give her the same as the other grandkids. She made it clear she didn't want that - so you followed her wishes. This is a clear case of \"be careful of what you wish for\".", "NTA - that behavior was rude, entitled and disrespectful. Your gift is up to you. She should have been grateful her grandparents got her anything and had come to her wedding. I wouldn't have given her the check after that and I sure as hell wouldn't have bought her that China set either.", "Also my great grandmother was very wealthy and cheap. She bought us (not on our registry) a hello kitty waffle iron. I laughed and kept it tell we eventually had kids. She came to our wedding and a disinvite was never even in the question! \n\nYou are NTA. You gave her what she wanted and had she been gracious she would have received an incredible cash gift instead. \n\nHer actions are the source of her problems.", "NTA she sounds entitled.", "NtA. It is your money and you choose how to spend it. Her behavior and entitlement over her wedding gift was incredibly inappropriate and atrocious!! And her excuse of being stressed is absolutely ridiculous!! She gets this selfishness and entitlement form somewhere and I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s your DIL. She\u2019s not trying to walk her comments back so that she can get her hands on the money. It\u2019s your decision on how to handle it from here. But there Will obviously be consequences with that decision. All I\u2019m saying is if you do decide at some point to give her the money to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d, \u201ckeep the family together\u201d please sit and talk with her about how horribly rude and disrespectful she was and ask for a genuine apology. If she can\u2019t acknowledge and apologize for that type of behavior, she mist definitely doesn\u2019t deserve the money. But if you choose not to give it to her, you\u2019re still definitely NTA. She is and so is her mom!", "If she hadnt called to complain about her gift, none of this would've happened. Thats what you tell anyone giving you flack. NTA\n\nIf she can change her tune in a few years, learn to be grateful for things and chill out, who knows maybe in some time she can earn some $$ for bettering herself, as like an anniversary gift. \n\nBut she clearly is very spoiled/entitled to call to complain about the gift that got picked from her own registy. \n\nI see your frustration, and its valid. You bought her a gift. And instead of saying, \"thanks for the gift\", she basically got mad and told you, \"you can do better\". \n\nWho acts like that? People who deserve a helping hand, dont act like that. I get shes stressed. But she does need to learn that her actions have consequences. And she broke her Grandma's heart. \n\nAt the moment, shes so concerned with the dollar amount she is failing to see how much she hurt your feelings. And THAT is why she isnt getting any money. Good luck Op", "NTA. I would have never, ever even *dreamed* of treating anyone who purchased a wedding gift for me in this manner when I got married. I was grateful for every gift big or small. My mother would have ripped me a new one if I ever acted like that as well, not defend me. \n\nHer I WaS sTrEsSeD excuse is utter BS. I was stressed to tears w/ wedding planning at times & never treated anyone this way, nor any other time in my life. I\u2019m sorry you have discovered that your granddaughter is an entitled, manipulative brat.", "Nta.\nMy grandparents are comfortable (money wise) they always help out family that's deserving of it. I would never call and ask them to spend more than they wanted to on me. Ops granddaughter should've been grateful to of received a gift and left it at that. Instead, she acted spoiled and entitled.", "NTA.  She\u2019s using being stressed as an excuse for being an awful entitled human.  Is she always like this?  I would never talk to my mother or grandparents that way.  Never.", "NTA. She reacted in a way that showed who she is. Your gift is optional and she disrespected you in a huge way. She then doubled down on her reaction and made threats if you don\u2019t comply. She has yet to truly own her poor behavior. \n\nPerhaps save the money and if she grows up in the next year, you can give it to her at her 1 year anniversary.", "NTA - this is a lesson in reeping what you sow and good things come to those who wait. Silly girl", "NTA, wow it's amazing how quickly entitlement appears when people are \"stressed\" about their wedding. She threw a tantrum to get a nicer gift and she got it. $40k is a blessing, not a necessity and she blew it by treating you poorly.", "NTA. She was ridiculous. If your grandparents normally give lavish gifts and you get a low cost item the human response would have been to check and make sure you guys were doing okay. \"Grandma, I don't want to make you uncomfortable but I'm seeing signs that you are struggling financially and I wanted to see if you need help with any costs related to the wedding. I can help out with accommodation or travel expenses because I love you and want you there on my special day.\" That's what you do when you love someone. I'm sorry that your granddaughter is an entitled brat. \n\nIf you feel guilty, throw the $40,000 into a trust for her future kids. Or make a donation in her name to a charity and then she'll get the write off. But all that is unnecessary because *you did absolutely nothing wrong*. \n\nAlso, FYI, I would be delighted to get an air fryer.", "[removed]", "NTA\u2026 she\u2019s suffering the consequences of her own actions.", "NTA - she shot herself in the foot with that one. Not sure why anyone would complain about receiving a gift that was on their registry.", "NTA she should have acted differently period.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. We had grandparents that played favorites and it was very hurtful. Not just with gifts but time and affection. However, you made a point to do the same thing for all the grandkids so far. This was very entitled behavior from her and if someone had told her that 40k was coming to her and she still was angry that you bought something cheap from the registry, she is just ungrateful and undeserving. She picked those gifts for the registry expecting people to choose from them. She asked you to buy something else which you graciously did. People aren\u2019t entitled to gifts or your money and I just can\u2019t believe she treated you like that. I\u2019m sorry, OP.", "NTA you have been very generous with your grandchildren. You can always give it to her for a 5th anniversary gift if her attitude & entitlement changes. I would not be quick to forget how she treated you.", "NTA. It\u2019s a lesson learned for her", "NTA.  She acted like a child and insulted you.  She asked her a more expensive gift which you gave her.  As you said, it\u2019s your money and she didn\u2019t deserve the large check", "NTA. \n\nI did have some limited sympathy for her: her own entitled behaviour at a time of high stress deprived her of a life-altering sum of money. And I'd wondered if perhaps you'd let the lesson sink in and give it to her at a much later date. \n\nBut this\n\n>She called us furious for discriminating against her.\n\ntook the biscuit. She hasn't learned the lesson at all. I don't think she understands that there is a lesson, even.\n\nGiving this woman 40k will likely do more damage than any good she could make of it. \n\nYou've 40k more than anticipated to spend on your retirement. Enjoy every cent of it.", "NTA. At first I thought...yea, she was probably just stressed and you can give her the money after she apologises. But now she's trying to emotionally manipulate you by refusing to attend Christmas- you cannot reward this behaviour.", "Nta, I love what you did. You were going to do something incredibly nice and she had the audacity to complain to you even before the wedding. She got what she deserved. She better be apologizing profusely and not just to win you back so you will give her $$. You don't need to give her anything else.", "NTA. Being \u201cstressed\u201d about your wedding doesn\u2019t excuse that kind of behavior.", "NTA \n\nShe is feeling the consequences of her own actions", "NTA\n\nOh boy! Explain to her mother, what you did to the other grandchildren, with teh cheap gift and the check after.\n\nThe granddaughter showed her greedy colours and can lay now in her cheap bed.\n\nI hope she learns from it.", "NTA she messed around and found out. She was being greedy and it came back and bit her in the but. Is it a life changing amount of money yes. Still she showed how she truly values you.", "NTA \n\nI would have done the same thing. That\u2019s gonna be an expensive lesson for her!", "NTA a lot of expectations and entitlement. Imho you made the correct call here. This is not discrimination, but reaction to her rather rude actions. Pity she only calls you when furious. Pity for her that is.\n\nSo, gran kid was asshole for actions, DiL for her comments, you not.", "NTA. I think we have all been disappointed in a gift from time to time. BUT most of us have been raised to just say \u201cthank you\u201d. It is still a gift and not required. I think she earned this treatment.", "Go Grandma for standing your ground.  Your money do what you wish", "NTA", "NTA. It goes to her overall judgment that she had the nerve to call you and complain about the gift and you should also be upset with the people you asked to keep it private who didn\u2019t. If you want to help her later you can let her know you\u2019ll do a dp on a house if she can qualify for a loan.", "NTA. She needs to learn that her actions have consequences. I totally agree with how you have handled this. She also needs to learn lessons in how to treat people with respect, especially her elders, how to not be materialistic and how not to be a bridezilla. Keep doing what you can to teach her these things", "NTA", "NTA. She acted disgustingly entitled when you had already gotten her a generous gift. If the air fryer was the cheapest thing on the registry, I\u2019m thinking a sense of entitlement might be a theme here.", "Nta. She screw around acted entitled and found out. She screw herself over. She only claiming now she was stress. If everyone still siding with her after they found out about her gross behavior.  There wrong to.", "NTA OP, I feel sorry for you. How are some  people behaving like this with their own family.", "NTA\nShe was ungrateful. She is not entitled to your money.", "NTA your money your decision. It is her and her parents problem on her not being there for Christmas. Maybe her parents can cough up the 40,000 dollars for her.", "It's your money and she and DIL are spoiled.  NTA", "Wow. Talk about entitled. Spoiled... NTA!!!", "NTA. This what happens when entitlement rears its ugly head. FAFO. \n\nNothing wrong with a little humility", "Okay the whole 40k aside, do you know how excited I\u2019d be to get an air fryer for a gift for any occasion? A good one is seriously not cheap. The fact she wasn\u2019t even appreciative for that speaks volumes, definitely NTA.", "\nIt is not discrimination - you didn\u2019t treat her differently on the basis of who she is or some inherent characteristic about her.\n\nYou treated her differently based on her behaviour - which makes it a consequence.", "I can't even imagine how either of these conversations went! Even if you had given them a card with $20 there should have been a call to say thank you and \"we can't wait to see you at the wedding.\" But if she called to say the air fryer showed she was discriminated against, when for all she knew all the other grandkids got some similar gift. I say NTA, especially since you didn't even tell her what the others got, which would have been my inclination.", "NTA\n\nThis is hilarious, I\u2019m glad she showed her entitled behaviour before you gave her the money. An air fryer is an awesome gift", "Your DIL and granddaughter are both entitled brats. You are right by not giving her the $$ because of how she treated you. She threatened to disinvite you to her wedding because she thought your gift was not good enough....just awful behavior.  Do not reward that behavior by giving her the money now.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Miss Entitled screwed herself over with her initial tantrum, and doubled down when she figured out the inevitable result of that. Stay strong. Your family has no right at all to dictate how or to whom you choose to gift money.", "No NTA some people only reflect on their actions after there is reprecautions. Only when it's convenient to them. So no NTA.", "NTA", "NTA and i really hope you don't give her the money down the line. her attitude is atrocious.", "NTA. She should be ashamed of herself for acting like she did. I\u2019m proud of you for not giving it to her.", "OP, everyone here is counseling you to blow up your relationship with your granddaughter and DIL. This has no consequences for them, yet can adversely effect everyone in your family. Don\u2019t blow up your family. \n\n- Buying the cheapest thing on the registry is game playing, it\u2019s a set up. \n\nYou might get pleasure from the \u201csurprise,\u201d but if the recipient happens to notice you bought the cheapest item, they feel badly for a while. They have to worry if they\u2019ve offended you? If you value them? If you\u2019re in financial trouble? I don\u2019t think this choice lands the way you want it to.\n\n- Is there any additional reason your granddaughter felt insulted? Maybe she\u2019s not as well treated as her siblings or cousins? Any reason she found the trick you were playing especially triggering? Please be honest.\n\nIf you\u2019re visibly well off, I hope you can now understand how you directly created this misunderstanding with your granddaughter. \n\nI understand it\u2019s tempting to believe everyone telling you she\u2019s entitled and you\u2019ll be tempted to double down, compound your mistake. She would never have called you upset *if you had not gone out of your way* to buy the most inexpensive thing on the registry. \n\n(Sorry to yell, this is more for the internet trolls)\n\nWRAPPING AN INEXPENSIVE GIFT NOT ON THE REGISTRY OR BUYING SOMETHING MID RANGE FROM THE REGISTRY WOULDN\u2019T SATISFY THE AGENDA TO BEWILDER THE RECIPIENT, WOULD IT? \n\nYou deliberately created a situation where each grandchild feels conflicted, confused, and likely disrespected right before their wedding. This time the recipient (your granddaughter) called you out and it backfired. \n\nYTA. I really think you have to fix this.", "NTA, first of all your money your right who to give and who not give, she ofc, and obviously only cared about the money so please don't take it to heart(as you seem really sweet) the behaviour of her/and your DIL, but they don't deserve even 1 percentage of the money.", "NTA!!! I had several family members buy something small off the registry and also gift a check/cash. I didn\u2019t invite anyone for a gift though. I just wanted to celebrate my marriage with the people I loved.", "NTA. Her refusal to attend Christmas is just more of the same behavior (like when she threatened to uninvite you to the wedding). Clearly she has not changed.  Do not give her the money; it will only encourage her entitled behavior. This is a lesson she needs to learn.", "The audacity, to say your discriminating against her, instead of apologising for being an AH in the place. I literally can\u2019t.. \n\nNTA", "Hmmmm. I would Def say NTA but also that the language doesn't sound like a 70 year old woman so not sure it's genuine.", "NTA", "Info: is this the only interaction with her that you\u2019ve had in her adult life? Is this typical behavior for her? I mean, if you know her to be a good person and this is out of character then is she really not deserving? If we were all judged on our singular worst behavior, none of us would deserve anything.", "Soft Esh. (Soft on op)  40 grand to your whole family *except* her? Did you really think none of your grandkids have EVER talked about receiving 40 THOUSAND DOLLARS?? That is blindly optimistic. I am stressed just thinking about it. I think her behavior was trash, twice over- but there is absolutely NO way she wasn't expecting to recieve \"the traditional family gift\" that literally *every single one of your grandkids* had received and definitely told thier cousins about. One of them told her about it that day. Loose lips sink ships. That is life changing money. The difference between being chronically homeless or having your kids grow up secure. College loans. College prepaid. Medical debt. \n\nI can't imagine singling out one of my kids or grandkids because they said something stupid (granted this was really stupid but weddings make many people completely lose their mind) when they were expecting a big fat check just like every single one of the other grand kids. You kind of baited her for a reaction with getting the cheapest thing on the list. I will bet nobody else noticed the gift once they learned about the 40 large. Do you owe it to her? No. Of course not. Does she have a right to feel singled out? Absolutely. Something tells me she has been reminded she is the baby of the family, and will probably get something even better and more grand over the entirety of her life, being built up by people telling her \"but you can't tell grama!\" \n\n I would sit down and talk to her and her parents. She is the child they raised. Seriously though, there is absolutely no way whatsoever that she didn't know there was a large payday coming. She will spend the rest of her life kicking herself for losing out on a 40 thousand dollar gift due to her own entitlement but she will also probably tell her kids and everyone else in\nthe family because secrets amongst blood never last long. \n\nThe rescinding of the gift is appropriate but if you want to avoid permanent damage,  maybe give her a way to earn back some of it. This is all assuming she is young and in her late teens early 20s. If she has been a functioning adult for a long time and this is typical behavior, there probably isn't much hope here. Good luck!", "This one is tough in some ways, but overall, not the asshole. I don't know your relationship, but I wonder if people told her you guys gave them very generous gifts and then she felt hurt by the air fryer. But her reaction is super spoiled and immature. It wouldn't have me wanting to give her a cheque after that behavior. It's an expensive lesson to learn, but for context, is she always a spoiled brat? Is this a one off? That would factor into the decision. It's your money at the end of the day and no one is entitled to it. Now, if you're looking for a way to spend that money she is no longer getting, I recently got married myself and am a very grateful gift receiptient..... \ud83d\ude0b", "ESH.  Your granddaughter obviously was an AH for talking to you like that. You are an AH for setting up a situation where someone was eventually going to get hurt. You can't keep a $40k gift a secret within the family; if a couple can suddenly afford a downpayment for a house others are going to notice and ask about it. It was always going to come out, and of course someone was going to feel like shit for not being worthy of the gift literally everyone else got. And you're going to let them feel like garbage up until the day of their wedding? \n\nI still think you're justified not giving her the money now, but jesus, you created a bad situation within your own family.", "let me resume to see if i get it right. you GD didn't know about your money gift , she knows you have money, you bought the cheapest gift on the list, and she feel undervalued and pissed by it.\r  \nshe told you agressivly because she feel hurt so you decide to not gift her the money.\r  \n\r  \nYTA you're punishing her because your surprise didn't work as planed", "I'm torn on this. It's your money and her behavior was very poor. But it's a life changing amount for most young people and she'll be at a disadvantage compared to her siblings unless her husband's family is well off. If she was truly sorry about her behavior I'd forgive her, but she seems like she's acting out by refusing to go to Christmas.\n\nPerhaps you could set up an account with the money and give it to her when she's ready to buy a house? She sounds irresponsible and might waste it otherwise. Or if she has student loans offer to give her the money to go toward that?", "My opinion is different than what it seems like everyone else here, but honestly ESH. \n\nYou are playing stupid games with your grandkids and it took until now for you to win your stupid prizes. Maybe the other grandkids didn\u2019t say something to your face, but they certainly felt the same way, until your secret gift. It almost sounds like you were WANTING your grandkids to do this, especially when you go out of your way to send it ahead of time to make it known you were intentionally getting them the cheapest thing on the registry. Just curious if you intentionally sending the cheap shitty gift in advance was what you did to the other grandkids as well? Props to the other grandkids for keeping it secret if so. I don\u2019t think that would ever happen in most families. \n\nYour granddaughter obviously shouldn\u2019t have called you complaining. So she sucks as well. \n\nThis is one of those things where it\u2019s \u201cour X, our rules\u201d. Yes, you certainly CAN withhold the money. It\u2019s your money, your rules. However being able to do something doesn\u2019t absolve you from being an AH for doing it. We have all seen tons of posts on this sub about people who come up with shitty rules for their wedding and try to claim \u201cmy wedding, my rules!\u201d Or people who have shitty house rules that discriminate against friends/family and claim \u201cour house, our rules!\u201d As in those cases, you can make whatever rules you want with your money. But it doesn\u2019t mean people won\u2019t think you are an AH for making those rules. \n\nI think you and granddaughter need to have a \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d meeting here, because it sounds like there is very serious damage to the relationship on both sides as a result of this, where \u201cthis\u201d being shitty moves on both sides. Your stupid game, her shitty response to your stupid game.", "ESH. C\u2019mon.", "I'm doubtless going to get downvoted to hell, but I'm going in a completely different direction here and going to say **YTA.**\n\nWhile your granddaughter's response to your gift was in very poor taste, and she could use some lessons in good manners, I suspect that it was a legitimately hurt reaction to genuine surprise that grandparents who are clearly very well off would deliberately choose to buy her not just something small, but specifically the very least expensive gift on her registry for one of the biggest celebrations of her life. It's not just about the money . . . as she noted when she spoke to you, it comes across as deliberately HURTFUL and a *statement of how you feel about her.*\n\nBut that's not even the important part. THIS IS THE IMPORTANT BIT:\n\nIf this were just about being generous to your grandkids and being private, you wouldn't be doing that whole \"buying the least expensive thing off their registry\" in advance of giving them money thing at all. There's no need for it. You'd just quietly go ahead and give them the cheque at an appropriate time. But you're not doing that. **This is very clearly a test: buy them a cheap gift first and see how they react.** And people who set up and \"test\" their loved ones to see if they are \"worthy\" recipients of their generosity and love - particularly on an occasion already fraught with stress, emotion, etc. - are horrifying. Honestly, the only people I know who test people like this either have Cluster B personality disorders, are immature teenagers, or are inherently cruel and enjoy manipulating others. None of those things speaks well of you.\n\nThis whole situation reeks of you setting your grandkids up for your weird, manipulative satisfaction. It's grotesque. And your excuse about asking them to keep it private is ridiculous. You could easily ask them not to discuss it with the extended family without making it an unnecessary secret from each other . . . unless of course I'm right and you ARE testing them, in which case you need them not to know so you can continue to test each one.\n\nAre you within your rights to do this? Absolutely, it's your money. You could make them walk across hot coals for it if you wanted to and you'd be well within your rights. But you're also a MASSIVE AH for it. Manipulative tests like this are not how you treat people you love, whether they \"pass\" them or not.

I think that a private conversation would be incredibly helpful and healing for your family.\n\nToo much changed between when you got married and now \u2014 heck, too much changed from when *I* got married. (I think I\u2019m about old enough to be the parents of the bride and groom.)\n\nThere was a time that weddings were simple, and people\u2019s expectations were more simple. Times were also easier. The last time mortgage rates were this high, the cost of housing was much lower \u2014 and that is after I adjust for inflation. I really believe that these changes have made weddings into more \u201chigh stakes\u201d events.\n\nI would understand if you don\u2019t want to have that conversation, but sometimes, family is more precious than pride.

If I do anything wrong please tell me.\n\nI(70s F) am the grandmother to 5 wonderful grandkids (3 women and 2 men). The last of my grandkids got married last October. My husband (70s M) and I usually get them a small gift (usually the cheapest thing on the registry), then the day before the wedding, we privately gift them a check for $40k, we prefer that they use it for a house, but we don\u2019t force them to do so. We also ask them to keep it private (we have a big extended family, and we don\u2019t want them to expect it from us). They all honored this request.\n\nWhen it came to our youngest granddaughter, we bought her an air fryer (that was the cheapest thing on the registry) and sent it in advance. Then she called us furious, she went off on us for being cheap and how she knew we had money, but that we did not love her enough to show it by getting her something more expensive.\n\nWe were horrified by her behavior, then she went ahead and threatened to disinvite us if we didn\u2019t get her a better gift. We discussed it, bought her a China set, but we did not give her the money that was set aside for her. We decided that she did not deserve it.\n\nFast foreword to last week, she met up with her brother, they got to talking and she found out about the cash gift that he got. She asked her cousins and found out all of them got the same gift. She called us furious for discriminating against her. We told her that it was our money, and after how she behaved, we did not want to give it to her.\n\nShe started crying, said that she was just extremely stressed, and that we shouldn\u2019t have taken it to heart. We told her that we stand by our decision. Now she is refusing to attend Christmas, and her mother (our DIL) is calling us AHs. So AWTAs.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Her behavior was atrocious, she is not entitled to your money. \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d consider giving it to her at a later date (birth of a child, some other milestone) IF she doesn\u2019t continue to act like a spoiled child.", "Absolutely NTA! Stress is not an excuse for ungrateful, entitled and manipulative behavior. And your DIL stepped way over the line.  It is not her business how you choose to use your money. And the fact that she seems to be excusing her daughter's behavior is a good indication of where the entitlement comes from.  I am sorry this happened. I imagine it was a joy to give your grandkids such a nice start to their married lives.  Being coerced and manipulated into giving is not a joyful experience.", "NTA. Sit her and her mother down and explain to her what you did with the others and why you did it. You always got the cheapest on the registry and then the money before the day of the wedding. You tried doing the same with her but she called you berating you for your \"cheap gift\" demanding you buy her something else. Because of her actions of entitlement means she got what she originally wanted....an expensive gift, therefore she gets no money.", "Nta", "Defiantly not the asshole. When I got married none of my grandparents were alive. I would have rather have them there instead of a present from them. She's just acting very entitled and spoiled.", "Definitely NTA. My husband and I are separated but I still have a relationship with one of my step sons. The other one only calls when he wants something. Guess who I\u2019m spending Christmas Eve with and guess who\u2019s child is getting presents.", "NTA. She's obviously spoiled. If you are worried about fairness, you can put it aside as a future gift to her or her kids if you ever feel a need to give it to her. Just don't tell her you did it.", "NTA - you got your granddaughter something from her registry. It\u2019s not her job to count your money. Who is to say that your financial situation hadn\u2019t changed since the last grandchild\u2019s wedding? \n\nThe stress of planning a wedding does not excuse your granddaughter\u2019s entitlement. Wedding culture has really gotten out of hand.", "NTA, she doesn\u2019t deserve anything", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences. She just learned the cost of being a spoiled jack ass", "Stressed or not, I think you made the right decision. She is turning everyone against you on this instead of truly acknowledging her mistake and showing contrition. Maybe in a couple of years you would have gifted it to her, there has to be some lesson learned, but instead she continued to show she was a spoiled brat.\n\nAlso, an air fryer is a nice gift. What was she asking for that that an air fryer \u201cwasn\u2019t good enough\u201d.", "NTA. Thank you for not enabling her entitlement!  Hopefully she becomes a better person from this experience.", "NTA, I can\u2019t believe anyone would purposely call to complain about a gift, how spoiled and entitled can one person be?

For my wedding my ex and I got a few presents that I wouldn\u2019t give, it wasn\u2019t any where close to anything on our registry and probably costed all of $5. Not only did I NOT complain, I graciously thanked them the same as I did everyone else in put it in our house where it was seen by all. I didn\u2019t even try to hide it. It was a home decoration that to me was ugly as sin. Oh well, that comes with the territory and it wasn\u2019t so horrible that anyone would be embarrassed by them. They just weren\u2019t good gifts. Your granddaughter sounds like a very spoiled brat and she showed her true colors. You responded to her behavior. You\u2019re perfectly right in my opinion!", "NTA. \n\nIf you were my grandmother and gotten me an air fryer, I would be happy to have received the gift and sent you a thank you card. \n\nI know that not everyone can afford a wedding gift, so I would just be happy to see you to be able to make the effort to show up at the wedding. If all what you could have gotten me is that, I would be content. \n\n$40,000 is a lot of money, and you want to make sure that they don't blow it. Her behavior shows that there is such a risk, so that makes you NTA twice over. \n\nI am looking into houses these days and if I would get a $40,000 gift, it's a 10% downpayment on a family-sized home in a family-friendly suburb of Houston TX that both my boyfriend and I would be very happy to own one day: https://redf.in/qanzZF\n\nFor the right person, it is a life-changing gift that starts their marriage on the right foot.

If you still want to give the money to her, at least wait until she shows some insight and humility.", "That is some serious entitled, brat behavior. Absolutely NTA, you were kind enough to get the china set because frankly she didn\u2019t even deserve that.", "NTA, not at all!", "NTA your granddaughter is a spoiled brat. I cannot believe she acted that way not once but twice. She threatened to disinvite you over a gift? Please do not give her the money.

Certainly not someone who is viscious one moment and apologizing only AFTER they find out they lost out big. This is like the princess and the pea story but more modern. People should be grateful for what they have and they should treat their family with respect. Maybe I have crossed over to \"old school\" now that I am 35 but I just was taught better than that. My grandmother (80) would turn me over her knee if I ever talked to her like that.

She told you she viewed you guys as a wallet, and cared about getting money out of you over than actually having you at her wedding. That cash gift is a family gift. She said she didn't view you as family and so you followed that energy.\n\nIt sounds like she shouldn't attend Christmas since that is an event for family and friends, and she is neither family or a friend she has proclaimed", "NTA!! \n\nLet me tell you a personal story.. my grandparents saved well and lived VERY frugally. By the time my grandfather passed away, my gram was left with enough money that she could have lived 100 more years without ever having to worry about a thing. She also lived well below her means. \n\nEvery Christmas after he died when I was a teenager (she didn\u2019t like to drive my grandpa always did all the driving) she would always get me 1 gift and 1 $50 gift card. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget the Christmas I opened up the UGLIEST mint green sweater I\u2019ve ever seen in my life! LOL When I say this sweater was god awful that is being kind to it\u2026.it was truly terrible! Hahaha \n\nI looked over at her biting her lower lip with a look of hope on her face, and gave her the brightest most genuine smile. I told her I absolutely LOVED IT! I gave her the biggest hug, thanking her profusely. I\u2019ve never seen her look so happy. \n\nDespite her including a gift receipt, I kept that sweater, and I wore that sweater often when I\u2019d go to visit her. As much as I truly hated the way that sweater looked, I really did love it. I loved it because I knew the effort my elderly grandmother put into driving (which terrified her) out to the mall (which she hated) to personally shop for me, and try to find something she thought I would like. That meant everything to me! \n\nYears later she still would cry as she told my dad, that out of all of her many grandchildren- I was the only one who EVER thanked her\u2026.year after year after year everyone else took her for granted until she was gone. I could NEVER imagine treated my grandparents this way!! \n\nMy point is you are NTA!! please keep your money. It\u2019s yours and even if you do give her a check- she will still never appreciate you for it. She will still take you for granted\u2026.

Go on Gma!\n\nThe correct response to a gift is \"Thank you!\" For my wedding, my grandmother detailed my car so when we got home from our honeymoon I had a sparkling ride.

Finally made a mends with dad in hospital. Opened bible and found a check written in it for the amount of the car he wanted.", "NAH.  Since you have done this for all of your grandchildren and the fact that you give them an additional gift should have been common knowledge amongst all of your grandchildren as they got married.

Unless you explained this too her prior to her wedding, I could see where she would be upset.  \n\nMy grandparents gave to their grandchildren equally and were a little more financially secure as we were growing up.

Grandma said she had given them to this daughter. Grandma explained that she herself was the youngest of ten, so when her own mother died, she still had little kids at home, and her older sibs wouldn't let her have anything else from her mother's house because all those kids would just break everything else. Grandma, in turn gave the candlesticks to this daughter, the one she was staying with, because this daughter was herself Grandma's youngest.  I thought it was a sweet story.\n\nBut cousin's greedy wife DIL, the wife of this aunt's oldest son, was visiting. She immediately started in begging, whining about how she deserved the candlesticks, and deserved then now. It was embarrassing and appalling.

She got going on wedding presents. (She and my poor cousin, her husband, are past their 50th anniversary now). DIL mentioned that another cousin had gotten married a month before DIL, so DIL had checked out what family members had given this cousin for gifts, so DIL could know what to expect to receive. DIL noticed that this cousin had received a piece of art from my parents, created by my father for the bride, whom he knew very well. DIL said she was so excited to know that she too would receive a piece of art like that from my parents... And think how sad she was when she realized that a) she (+ husband, presumably) didn't get any art from my parents, and b) didn't get ANYthing from my parents. This woman has been carrying that story around for half a century! No WONDER my parents gave them nothing special. There's also the fact that even though DIL's husband was my dad's nephew, my parents really didn't know that family.\n\nAbout fifty possible responses to DIL flooded my mind, but as she continued her story I thought, it's probably better just to ignore all this.

XD", "Just rolled their eyes.  We all knew about the sexism.  I was honestly expecting less and found it funny by that point.  Every year for Christmas grandkids got $2 and a pair of socks.  Not the whole bag of socks, 1 pair.  That bag would cover birthdays and Christmases for 3 years straight.  I actually did take the $5 and buy ice cream.  My friends and I found it hilarious.", "I'm conflicted about this moreso that the top comments. \n\nClearly the granddaughter was an AH. But getting your grandkids the cheapest thing on the registry when you are wealthy and then surprising them with a transformative amount of money at the wedding feels like...I dunno almost like a prank or a game.\n\nWhy do you do this to them? What is the point of getting some cheap shit and then giving money later but making it a secret?  I guarantee you some of your other grandkids were probably like WTF but were gracious enough not to say anything. Or they bitched to the preceding siblings who told them to be patient.\n\nI feel like if you just gave them the gift you planned on giving them without the gotcha prank this wouldn't have happened. As a result your relationship with your grandkids and potential great grandkids is fucked. I'm not absolving your granddaughter but I think this whole charade kinda sucks.\n\nESH.", "This one is tough. This grandchild will always believe that they mattered much less to you than the rest. As the black sheep, I\u2019ve watched my dad and step mom gift the other grandchildren wonderful presents for birthdays and Christmas and mine get gifts that look like last minute after-thought gifts. I\u2019ve never said anything to my dad and neither have my kids, but they definitely can see that my siblings and their cousins matter more. \n\nIt\u2019s your money (but you can\u2019t take it with you) and you\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do. If this is out of her character and you will destroy the relationship or allow it to be destroyed over this, it\u2019s on you, imho.", "Do you really know her so little that this is the only interaction you have to judge her by? Seems like a shame that you saved up all that money for her and yet you never spent time with her. if you had you would probably have a nicer woman.", "I agree. Giving in sets a precedent for her in life. Also it's probably what's caused this behaviour + she sounds like she's never heard a \"no\" before now.", "I know that was long, I actually really appreciate you reading my story. I miss my grandparents everyday and would give anything to have them back, so I enjoy sharing about them \u2764\ufe0f", "This is truth. My niece and nephew don\u2019t even text thank you. I have to ask my sister if they got their presents. My daughter didn\u2019t send cards out after her baby shower so my mother did it for her lol. My mom said it was absolutely scandalous.", "Oooooo\u2026the petty in me LOVES this!!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "So I\u2019m not the one who said RIP instant pot, butttt I hated mine too\ud83d\ude02 \n\nI felt like the learning curve was so high that I was taking more time to cook less food and honestly it scared me a little too. So I gave it to my sister\u2026she uses it every night and my best friend uses hers all the time too so I think it\u2019s really a ymmv type of thing. \n\nAlso, love the username cuz\u2764\ufe0f", "The same person who thought a good 'cheap' gift was an air fryer?", "I mean, I would have. Why would you get another gift? Of course, I would have been grateful for any gift because gift!", "A copy of Charlie & the Chocolate Factory would be appropriate, although I doubt she'd read it.", "Give the other 4 grandkids an extra $10k for Christmas."]}
