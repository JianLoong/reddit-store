If I do anything wrong please tell me.\n\nI(70s F) am the grandmother to 5 wonderful grandkids (3 women and 2 men). The last of my grandkids got married last October. My husband (70s M) and I usually get them a small gift (usually the cheapest thing on the registry), then the day before the wedding, we privately gift them a check for $40k, we prefer that they use it for a house, but we don\u2019t force them to do so. We also ask them to keep it private (we have a big extended family, and we don\u2019t want them to expect it from us). They all honored this request.\n\nWhen it came to our youngest granddaughter, we bought her an air fryer (that was the cheapest thing on the registry) and sent it in advance. Then she called us furious, she went off on us for being cheap and how she knew we had money, but that we did not love her enough to show it by getting her something more expensive.\n\nWe were horrified by her behavior, then she went ahead and threatened to disinvite us if we didn\u2019t get her a better gift. We discussed it, bought her a China set, but we did not give her the money that was set aside for her. We decided that she did not deserve it.\n\nFast foreword to last week, she met up with her brother, they got to talking and she found out about the cash gift that he got. She asked her cousins and found out all of them got the same gift. She called us furious for discriminating against her. We told her that it was our money, and after how she behaved, we did not want to give it to her.\n\nShe started crying, said that she was just extremely stressed, and that we shouldn\u2019t have taken it to heart. We told her that we stand by our decision. Now she is refusing to attend Christmas, and her mother (our DIL) is calling us AHs. So AWTAs.", "created_utc": 1671295217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zoa8ez/aita_awta_for_not_giving_our_granddaughter_the/", "score": 861, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s not stress, that\u2019s spoiled. And her mother backing her up shows why she is spoiled.\n\nIf she\u2019d apologised BEFORE finding out about the money, then you might\u2019ve believed that her remorse was been real\u2026. But she didn\u2019t. \n\nShe called you \u2018furious\u2019 once she found out - trying to force you to give her more AGAIN. Then tried tears to manipulate you. Now, with no wedding to blame her behaviour on, she\u2019s refusing to come to events until you cough up the cash. \n\nGuess you know what value she puts on her grandparents. She\u2019s entitled, spoiled and rude.", "NTA\nAt the end of the day, it is your money. Patience is a virtue and had she a little more of it, she would\u2019ve been rewarded. Instead, she acted like a spoiled selfish brat. She isn\u2019t entitled to that gift, tell her she got her two gifts and that you don\u2019t want to discriminate her siblings and cousins by getting her three gifts when everyone else got two.", "NTA. I would never DREAM of criticizing a gift, never mind coming from a family member. I\u2019m horrified at her behavior. And her doubling down and wanting to not attend Christmas? I\u2019d stay with the decision. If she had apologized profusely and then let it go I might have gifted the original money on their one year anniversary. But her continued tantrum, no. She does not deserve it acting like an entitled spoiled brat.", "NTA.\n\nShe bit your hand and expected you to feed her afterward? *Hell* no. \n\nShe threatened to *uninvite* you over an *Air Fryer*. If she'd just been Grateful or Graceful, she'd have gotten exactly what she was screaming at you about wanting. But no, she couldn't even *feign* composure, and tried to bully you into giving her what she wanted. \n\nIt's not even like you got her something that wasn't on the registry, she just thought she was entitled to your money. Sucks to be her, she gets less now because she threatened you, who the money belongs to. \n\nThis'll be a hard lesson for her, maybe, but it's one that seems to be well overdue, and it's one she needs to learn.", "NTA.\n\nI agree with your decision to withhold that check and I probably would have done the exact same thing if I were in your position.\n\nThe fact that she views you only as a cash cow and wouldn't even want you to attend her wedding UNLESS you forked over a check sounds like extortion. It shows that she only values you for the money she thinks that she can get from you. It's a disgusting way to treat a supposed loved one. \n\nInteresting that instead of apologizing and acknowledging what she did was wrong she chose the manipulative route instead: crying and claiming she wasn't serious. Most likely because this approach probably got her what she wanted as a child. By giving her the check now you would be enabling this atrocious behavior.", "NTA. Calling anyone to complain about a gift is stupid. Your granddaughter has no manners. Just because someone has money doesn't mean they are obligated to give some to you. I am sorry she turned a happy occasion into a s#itshow.", "NTA she's not sorry. She's just sorry she got caught. I can't in a million years ever imagine being this disrespectful to anybody, especially my grandmother. Why does wealth turn people into such AHs?", "NTA\n\nAnd her mother should be ashamed for not raising a daughter with manners. Maybe if she\u2019d been taught that throwing a toddler tantrum didn\u2019t result in her getting her way, this could have been avoided.  \n\nBut then there\u2019s the entitlement. Sigh.", "NTA\n\nAll of your grandchildren got two gifts from you. She was ungrateful about gift #1.  You didn\u2019t discriminate against her. She acted like a brat and learned a very important lesson. \n\nIf you\u2019re feeling generous, you could leave it to her in your will. But don\u2019t let her know that. That\u2019s how you end up on Dateline.", "NTA.  Your first gift option was an air fryer and then a check (at the wedding).  She emphatically told you that she wanted a more expensive gift from her registry instead.  You did that with the purchase of the china set.  She got what she asked for.  All she had to do was show grace which she is incapable of; in reddit land \u201cshe fucked around and found out\u201d and where I come from we call your granddaughter a \u201csmacked ass\u201d.", "I applaud you.  These are hard lessons but she also sounds like a slow learner.  \n\nUnfortunately, this will probably divide your family as your daughter is taking her side.  \n\nI hope you don\u2019t cave in.  \n\nEven if she were stressed, that is no way to speak to you.  She needs to learn to take a step back and breathe before speaking her mind.", "NTA.\n\nAlso can I just say\u2026an air fryer was the CHEAPEST thing on the registry? Don\u2019t those things *start* at around a hundred dollars? I mean\u2026was she just assuming everyone would have to pony up just to come to the wedding? (This whole thing is just very strange to me. I didn\u2019t even *know* what people got me until *after* my wedding.)", "NTA, she deserved that. Stress doesn't make you blatantly disrespect someone you love and act like an entitled brat. If she was unhappy about the gift, she could've just shut up and put up with it. You value the people for who they are, not what they can give you.", "NTA. She was horrible to you. Actions have consequences.", "NTA. Those are the life lessons that I love. She was rude to you and she acted entitled. She now has to deal with the consequences of her actions.", "NTA - she was extremely entitled going off on you guys for getting her a cheap gift. She should have been gracious and thank you profusely for even getting her a gift. Just going to say I don't have any plans getting married but I absolutely will take your gift, the air fryer and the check haha. Honestly you did nothing wrong and the granddaughter is not necessarily being discriminated against, she's just acting entitled", "NTA, nobody deserves that kind of financial help after being so rude and disrespectful. Also, if you're DiL is so pissed about the whole thing *she* can give them 40k, after all, if she'd raised her daughter to be more polite to begin with this situation wouldn't have occurred \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "My grandmother was my only grandparent left when I got married.  The fact that she was AT my wedding was gift enough.  The utter gall of your granddaughter just makes me ill.  She does not deserve your generosity; I don't think I'd ever be able to get over it.  She won't be a great loss at Christmas and her mother should stay and keep her company.  They can be hateful together and not ruin anybody else's holiday.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your choice of gift is entirely up to you. You were nicer than I, since I wouldn't have given her a china set.", "NTA  Your granddaughter demanded you give her  a better gift so in addition to the air fryer, you gifted her a china set. She never apologized and explained she was stressed until she found out that you had gifted your other grand children money in addition to the cheapest thing on the registry. Your finances are no one's business but your own. No one is entitled to monetary gifts.", "NTA, if your granddaughter would have simply been grateful she would have gotten what everyone else did.", "Reddit has plenty of cases of the grandparents having to tell their grandchildren no for the first time in their life, so you are not alone. \n\nGood on ya for not giving in to her entitlement. Sorry that your DIL and son failed your grandchild. You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nEntitlement and disrespect has consequences.", "Nta. She had no grace. How embarrassing for her.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nShe sounds spoiled enough, no need to spoil her more. \n\nLet her miss Christmas, she\u2019ll learn eventually.", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to inheritance/gift money that isn\u2019t currently being offered/given to them.", "NTA\n\nI have secondhand embarrassment for her. The absolute gall of someone to call and complain about a gift, DEMAND another, and then call and complain AGAIN and demand another again. I\u2019m horrified.", "NTA. the fact that your DIL is calling you AH shows how your grand daughter was brought up. Hopefully this lesson teaches both of them to be more polite.", "NTA...struggling to find the right phrase...\n\nPlay stupid games; win stupid prizes?\n\nFuck around and find out?\n\nBe a selfish brat and suffer the consequences?\n\nThe last one is less catchy but sums it up I think.\n\nI'm sorry your granddaughter has done this to you. You've obviously saved up a lot of money for each of them and giving is as good as receiving. She has pulled this experience from you as much as her not getting money herself.", "Nta. You planned to give her the same as the other grandkids. She made it clear she didn't want that - so you followed her wishes. This is a clear case of \"be careful of what you wish for\".", "NTA - that behavior was rude, entitled and disrespectful. Your gift is up to you. She should have been grateful her grandparents got her anything and had come to her wedding. I wouldn't have given her the check after that and I sure as hell wouldn't have bought her that China set either.", "Also my great grandmother was very wealthy and cheap. She bought us (not on our registry) a hello kitty waffle iron. I laughed and kept it tell we eventually had kids. She came to our wedding and a disinvite was never even in the question! \n\nYou are NTA. You gave her what she wanted and had she been gracious she would have received an incredible cash gift instead. \n\nHer actions are the source of her problems.", "NTA she sounds entitled.", "NtA. It is your money and you choose how to spend it. Her behavior and entitlement over her wedding gift was incredibly inappropriate and atrocious!! And her excuse of being stressed is absolutely ridiculous!! She gets this selfishness and entitlement form somewhere and I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s your DIL. She\u2019s not trying to walk her comments back so that she can get her hands on the money. It\u2019s your decision on how to handle it from here. But there Will obviously be consequences with that decision. All I\u2019m saying is if you do decide at some point to give her the money to \u201ckeep the peace\u201d, \u201ckeep the family together\u201d please sit and talk with her about how horribly rude and disrespectful she was and ask for a genuine apology. If she can\u2019t acknowledge and apologize for that type of behavior, she mist definitely doesn\u2019t deserve the money. But if you choose not to give it to her, you\u2019re still definitely NTA. She is and so is her mom!", "If she hadnt called to complain about her gift, none of this would've happened. Thats what you tell anyone giving you flack. NTA\n\nIf she can change her tune in a few years, learn to be grateful for things and chill out, who knows maybe in some time she can earn some $$ for bettering herself, as like an anniversary gift. \n\nBut she clearly is very spoiled/entitled to call to complain about the gift that got picked from her own registy. \n\nI see your frustration, and its valid. You bought her a gift. And instead of saying, \"thanks for the gift\", she basically got mad and told you, \"you can do better\". \n\nWho acts like that? People who deserve a helping hand, dont act like that. I get shes stressed. But she does need to learn that her actions have consequences. And she broke her Grandma's heart. \n\nAt the moment, shes so concerned with the dollar amount she is failing to see how much she hurt your feelings. And THAT is why she isnt getting any money. Good luck Op", "NTA. I would have never, ever even *dreamed* of treating anyone who purchased a wedding gift for me in this manner when I got married. I was grateful for every gift big or small. My mother would have ripped me a new one if I ever acted like that as well, not defend me. \n\nHer I WaS sTrEsSeD excuse is utter BS. I was stressed to tears w/ wedding planning at times & never treated anyone this way, nor any other time in my life. I\u2019m sorry you have discovered that your granddaughter is an entitled, manipulative brat.", "Nta.\nMy grandparents are comfortable (money wise) they always help out family that's deserving of it. I would never call and ask them to spend more than they wanted to on me. Ops granddaughter should've been grateful to of received a gift and left it at that. Instead, she acted spoiled and entitled.", "NTA.  She\u2019s using being stressed as an excuse for being an awful entitled human.  Is she always like this?  I would never talk to my mother or grandparents that way.  Never.", "NTA. She reacted in a way that showed who she is. Your gift is optional and she disrespected you in a huge way. She then doubled down on her reaction and made threats if you don\u2019t comply. She has yet to truly own her poor behavior. \n\nPerhaps save the money and if she grows up in the next year, you can give it to her at her 1 year anniversary.", "NTA - this is a lesson in reeping what you sow and good things come to those who wait. Silly girl", "NTA, wow it's amazing how quickly entitlement appears when people are \"stressed\" about their wedding. She threw a tantrum to get a nicer gift and she got it. $40k is a blessing, not a necessity and she blew it by treating you poorly.", "NTA. She was ridiculous. If your grandparents normally give lavish gifts and you get a low cost item the human response would have been to check and make sure you guys were doing okay. \"Grandma, I don't want to make you uncomfortable but I'm seeing signs that you are struggling financially and I wanted to see if you need help with any costs related to the wedding. I can help out with accommodation or travel expenses because I love you and want you there on my special day.\" That's what you do when you love someone. I'm sorry that your granddaughter is an entitled brat. \n\nIf you feel guilty, throw the $40,000 into a trust for her future kids. Or make a donation in her name to a charity and then she'll get the write off. But all that is unnecessary because *you did absolutely nothing wrong*. \n\nAlso, FYI, I would be delighted to get an air fryer.", "I lean towards NTA. Your youngest granddaughter acted entitled and kinda like a gold digger, expecting from you to give a more expensive gift, calling the fact that you and your husband have money. Then she called this whole ordeal as wedding stress. She kinda tried to gaslight you and make you feel that you're at fault. \nTo the OP, it's your and your husband's money and you decide what to do with it. Your other grandkids showed decency and respect when they received their wedding gift and money, while the youngest daughter didn't show respect and became entitled. \nIn conclusion, NTA.", "NTA\u2026 she\u2019s suffering the consequences of her own actions.", "NTA - she shot herself in the foot with that one. Not sure why anyone would complain about receiving a gift that was on their registry.", "NTA she should have acted differently period.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA. We had grandparents that played favorites and it was very hurtful. Not just with gifts but time and affection. However, you made a point to do the same thing for all the grandkids so far. This was very entitled behavior from her and if someone had told her that 40k was coming to her and she still was angry that you bought something cheap from the registry, she is just ungrateful and undeserving. She picked those gifts for the registry expecting people to choose from them. She asked you to buy something else which you graciously did. People aren\u2019t entitled to gifts or your money and I just can\u2019t believe she treated you like that. I\u2019m sorry, OP.", "NTA you have been very generous with your grandchildren. You can always give it to her for a 5th anniversary gift if her attitude & entitlement changes. I would not be quick to forget how she treated you.", "NTA. It\u2019s a lesson learned for her", "NTA.  She acted like a child and insulted you.  She asked her a more expensive gift which you gave her.  As you said, it\u2019s your money and she didn\u2019t deserve the large check", "NTA. \n\nI did have some limited sympathy for her: her own entitled behaviour at a time of high stress deprived her of a life-altering sum of money. And I'd wondered if perhaps you'd let the lesson sink in and give it to her at a much later date. \n\nBut this\n\n>She called us furious for discriminating against her.\n\ntook the biscuit. She hasn't learned the lesson at all. I don't think she understands that there is a lesson, even.\n\nGiving this woman 40k will likely do more damage than any good she could make of it. \n\nYou've 40k more than anticipated to spend on your retirement. Enjoy every cent of it.", "NTA. At first I thought...yea, she was probably just stressed and you can give her the money after she apologises. But now she's trying to emotionally manipulate you by refusing to attend Christmas- you cannot reward this behaviour.", "Nta, I love what you did. You were going to do something incredibly nice and she had the audacity to complain to you even before the wedding. She got what she deserved. She better be apologizing profusely and not just to win you back so you will give her $$. You don't need to give her anything else.", "NTA. Being \u201cstressed\u201d about your wedding doesn\u2019t excuse that kind of behavior.", "NTA \n\nShe is feeling the consequences of her own actions", "NTA\n\nOh boy! Explain to her mother, what you did to the other grandchildren, with teh cheap gift and the check after.\n\nThe granddaughter showed her greedy colours and can lay now in her cheap bed.\n\nI hope she learns from it.", "NTA she messed around and found out. She was being greedy and it came back and bit her in the but. Is it a life changing amount of money yes. Still she showed how she truly values you.", "NTA \n\nI would have done the same thing. That\u2019s gonna be an expensive lesson for her!", "NTA a lot of expectations and entitlement. Imho you made the correct call here. This is not discrimination, but reaction to her rather rude actions. Pity she only calls you when furious. Pity for her that is.\n\nSo, gran kid was asshole for actions, DiL for her comments, you not.", "NTA. I think we have all been disappointed in a gift from time to time. BUT most of us have been raised to just say \u201cthank you\u201d. It is still a gift and not required. I think she earned this treatment.", "Go Grandma for standing your ground.  Your money do what you wish", "NTA", "NTA. It goes to her overall judgment that she had the nerve to call you and complain about the gift and you should also be upset with the people you asked to keep it private who didn\u2019t. If you want to help her later you can let her know you\u2019ll do a dp on a house if she can qualify for a loan.", "NTA. She needs to learn that her actions have consequences. I totally agree with how you have handled this. She also needs to learn lessons in how to treat people with respect, especially her elders, how to not be materialistic and how not to be a bridezilla. Keep doing what you can to teach her these things", "NTA", "NTA. She acted disgustingly entitled when you had already gotten her a generous gift. If the air fryer was the cheapest thing on the registry, I\u2019m thinking a sense of entitlement might be a theme here.", "Nta. She screw around acted entitled and found out. She screw herself over. She only claiming now she was stress. If everyone still siding with her after they found out about her gross behavior.  There wrong to.", "NTA OP, I feel sorry for you. How are some  people behaving like this with their own family.", "NTA\nShe was ungrateful. She is not entitled to your money.", "NTA your money your decision. It is her and her parents problem on her not being there for Christmas. Maybe her parents can cough up the 40,000 dollars for her.", "It's your money and she and DIL are spoiled.  NTA", "Wow. Talk about entitled. Spoiled... NTA!!!", "NTA. This what happens when entitlement rears its ugly head. FAFO. \n\nNothing wrong with a little humility", "Okay the whole 40k aside, do you know how excited I\u2019d be to get an air fryer for a gift for any occasion? A good one is seriously not cheap. The fact she wasn\u2019t even appreciative for that speaks volumes, definitely NTA.", "\nIt is not discrimination - you didn\u2019t treat her differently on the basis of who she is or some inherent characteristic about her.\n\nYou treated her differently based on her behaviour - which makes it a consequence.", "I can't even imagine how either of these conversations went! Even if you had given them a card with $20 there should have been a call to say thank you and \"we can't wait to see you at the wedding.\" But if she called to say the air fryer showed she was discriminated against, when for all she knew all the other grandkids got some similar gift. I say NTA, especially since you didn't even tell her what the others got, which would have been my inclination.", "NTA\n\nThis is hilarious, I\u2019m glad she showed her entitled behaviour before you gave her the money. An air fryer is an awesome gift", "Your DIL and granddaughter are both entitled brats. You are right by not giving her the $$ because of how she treated you. She threatened to disinvite you to her wedding because she thought your gift was not good enough....just awful behavior.  Do not reward that behavior by giving her the money now.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Miss Entitled screwed herself over with her initial tantrum, and doubled down when she figured out the inevitable result of that. Stay strong. Your family has no right at all to dictate how or to whom you choose to gift money.", "No NTA some people only reflect on their actions after there is reprecautions. Only when it's convenient to them. So no NTA.", "NTA", "NTA and i really hope you don't give her the money down the line. her attitude is atrocious.", "NTA. She should be ashamed of herself for acting like she did. I\u2019m proud of you for not giving it to her.", "OP, everyone here is counseling you to blow up your relationship with your granddaughter and DIL. This has no consequences for them, yet can adversely effect everyone in your family. Don\u2019t blow up your family. \n\n- Buying the cheapest thing on the registry is game playing, it\u2019s a set up. \n\nYou might get pleasure from the \u201csurprise,\u201d but if the recipient happens to notice you bought the cheapest item, they feel badly for a while. They have to worry if they\u2019ve offended you? If you value them? If you\u2019re in financial trouble? I don\u2019t think this choice lands the way you want it to.\n\n- Is there any additional reason your granddaughter felt insulted? Maybe she\u2019s not as well treated as her siblings or cousins? Any reason she found the trick you were playing especially triggering? Please be honest.\n\nIf you\u2019re visibly well off, I hope you can now understand how you directly created this misunderstanding with your granddaughter. \n\nI understand it\u2019s tempting to believe everyone telling you she\u2019s entitled and you\u2019ll be tempted to double down, compound your mistake. She would never have called you upset *if you had not gone out of your way* to buy the most inexpensive thing on the registry. \n\n(Sorry to yell, this is more for the internet trolls)\n\nWRAPPING AN INEXPENSIVE GIFT NOT ON THE REGISTRY OR BUYING SOMETHING MID RANGE FROM THE REGISTRY WOULDN\u2019T SATISFY THE AGENDA TO BEWILDER THE RECIPIENT, WOULD IT? \n\nYou deliberately created a situation where each grandchild feels conflicted, confused, and likely disrespected right before their wedding. This time the recipient (your granddaughter) called you out and it backfired. \n\nYTA. I really think you have to fix this.", "NTA, first of all your money your right who to give and who not give, she ofc, and obviously only cared about the money so please don't take it to heart(as you seem really sweet) the behaviour of her/and your DIL, but they don't deserve even 1 percentage of the money.", "NTA!!! I had several family members buy something small off the registry and also gift a check/cash. I didn\u2019t invite anyone for a gift though. I just wanted to celebrate my marriage with the people I loved.", "NTA. Her refusal to attend Christmas is just more of the same behavior (like when she threatened to uninvite you to the wedding). Clearly she has not changed.  Do not give her the money; it will only encourage her entitled behavior. This is a lesson she needs to learn.", "The audacity, to say your discriminating against her, instead of apologising for being an AH in the place. I literally can\u2019t.. \n\nNTA", "Hmmmm. I would Def say NTA but also that the language doesn't sound like a 70 year old woman so not sure it's genuine.", "NTA", "Info: is this the only interaction with her that you\u2019ve had in her adult life? Is this typical behavior for her? I mean, if you know her to be a good person and this is out of character then is she really not deserving? If we were all judged on our singular worst behavior, none of us would deserve anything.", "Soft Esh. (Soft on op)  40 grand to your whole family *except* her? Did you really think none of your grandkids have EVER talked about receiving 40 THOUSAND DOLLARS?? That is blindly optimistic. I am stressed just thinking about it. I think her behavior was trash, twice over- but there is absolutely NO way she wasn't expecting to recieve \"the traditional family gift\" that literally *every single one of your grandkids* had received and definitely told thier cousins about. One of them told her about it that day. Loose lips sink ships. That is life changing money. The difference between being chronically homeless or having your kids grow up secure. College loans. College prepaid. Medical debt. \n\nI can't imagine singling out one of my kids or grandkids because they said something stupid (granted this was really stupid but weddings make many people completely lose their mind) when they were expecting a big fat check just like every single one of the other grand kids. You kind of baited her for a reaction with getting the cheapest thing on the list. I will bet nobody else noticed the gift once they learned about the 40 large. Do you owe it to her? No. Of course not. Does she have a right to feel singled out? Absolutely. Something tells me she has been reminded she is the baby of the family, and will probably get something even better and more grand over the entirety of her life, being built up by people telling her \"but you can't tell grama!\" \n\n I would sit down and talk to her and her parents. She is the child they raised. Seriously though, there is absolutely no way whatsoever that she didn't know there was a large payday coming. She will spend the rest of her life kicking herself for losing out on a 40 thousand dollar gift due to her own entitlement but she will also probably tell her kids and everyone else in\nthe family because secrets amongst blood never last long. \n\nThe rescinding of the gift is appropriate but if you want to avoid permanent damage,  maybe give her a way to earn back some of it. This is all assuming she is young and in her late teens early 20s. If she has been a functioning adult for a long time and this is typical behavior, there probably isn't much hope here. Good luck!", "This one is tough in some ways, but overall, not the asshole. I don't know your relationship, but I wonder if people told her you guys gave them very generous gifts and then she felt hurt by the air fryer. But her reaction is super spoiled and immature. It wouldn't have me wanting to give her a cheque after that behavior. It's an expensive lesson to learn, but for context, is she always a spoiled brat? Is this a one off? That would factor into the decision. It's your money at the end of the day and no one is entitled to it.

Your granddaughter obviously was an AH for talking to you like that. You are an AH for setting up a situation where someone was eventually going to get hurt. You can't keep a $40k gift a secret within the family; if a couple can suddenly afford a downpayment for a house others are going to notice and ask about it. It was always going to come out, and of course someone was going to feel like shit for not being worthy of the gift literally everyone else got. And you're going to let them feel like garbage up until the day of their wedding? \n\nI still think you're justified not giving her the money now, but jesus, you created a bad situation within your own family.", "let me resume to see if i get it right. you GD didn't know about your money gift , she knows you have money, you bought the cheapest gift on the list, and she feel undervalued and pissed by it.\r  \nshe told you agressivly because she feel hurt so you decide to not gift her the money.\r  \n\r  \nYTA you're punishing her because your surprise didn't work as planed", "I'm torn on this. It's your money and her behavior was very poor. But it's a life changing amount for most young people and she'll be at a disadvantage compared to her siblings unless her husband's family is well off. If she was truly sorry about her behavior I'd forgive her, but she seems like she's acting out by refusing to go to Christmas.\n\nPerhaps you could set up an account with the money and give it to her when she's ready to buy a house? She sounds irresponsible and might waste it otherwise. Or if she has student loans offer to give her the money to go toward that?", "My opinion is different than what it seems like everyone else here, but honestly ESH. \n\nYou are playing stupid games with your grandkids and it took until now for you to win your stupid prizes. Maybe the other grandkids didn\u2019t say something to your face, but they certainly felt the same way, until your secret gift. It almost sounds like you were WANTING your grandkids to do this, especially when you go out of your way to send it ahead of time to make it known you were intentionally getting them the cheapest thing on the registry. Just curious if you intentionally sending the cheap shitty gift in advance was what you did to the other grandkids as well? Props to the other grandkids for keeping it secret if so.

We have all seen tons of posts on this sub about people who come up with shitty rules for their wedding and try to claim \u201cmy wedding, my rules!\u201d Or people who have shitty house rules that discriminate against friends/family and claim \u201cour house, our rules!\u201d As in those cases, you can make whatever rules you want with your money. But it doesn\u2019t mean people won\u2019t think you are an AH for making those rules. \n\nI think you and granddaughter need to have a \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d meeting here, because it sounds like there is very serious damage to the relationship on both sides as a result of this, where \u201cthis\u201d being shitty moves on both sides.

C\u2019mon.", "I'm doubtless going to get downvoted to hell, but I'm going in a completely different direction here and going to say **YTA.**\n\nWhile your granddaughter's response to your gift was in very poor taste, and she could use some lessons in good manners, I suspect that it was a legitimately hurt reaction to genuine surprise that grandparents who are clearly very well off would deliberately choose to buy her not just something small, but specifically the very least expensive gift on her registry for one of the biggest celebrations of her life. It's not just about the money . . . as she noted when she spoke to you, it comes across as deliberately HURTFUL and a *statement of how you feel about her.*\n\nBut that's not even the important part. THIS IS THE IMPORTANT BIT:\n\nIf this were just about being generous to your grandkids and being private, you wouldn't be doing that whole \"buying the least expensive thing off their registry\" in advance of giving them money thing at all. There's no need for it. You'd just quietly go ahead and give them the cheque at an appropriate time. But you're not doing that. **This is very clearly a test: buy them a cheap gift first and see how they react.** And people who set up and \"test\" their loved ones to see if they are \"worthy\" recipients of their generosity and love - particularly on an occasion already fraught with stress, emotion, etc. - are horrifying. Honestly, the only people I know who test people like this either have Cluster B personality disorders, are immature teenagers, or are inherently cruel and enjoy manipulating others. None of those things speaks well of you.\n\nThis whole situation reeks of you setting your grandkids up for your weird, manipulative satisfaction. It's grotesque. And your excuse about asking them to keep it private is ridiculous. You could easily ask them not to discuss it with the extended family without making it an unnecessary secret from each other . . . unless of course I'm right and you ARE testing them, in which case you need them not to know so you can continue to test each one.\n\nAre you within your rights to do this? Absolutely, it's your money. You could make them walk across hot coals for it if you wanted to and you'd be well within your rights. But you're also a MASSIVE AH for it.

I think that a private conversation would be incredibly helpful and healing for your family.\n\nToo much changed between when you got married and now \u2014 heck, too much changed from when *I* got married.

The last time mortgage rates were this high, the cost of housing was much lower \u2014 and that is after I adjust for inflation. I really believe that these changes have made weddings into more \u201chigh stakes\u201d events.\n\nI would understand if you don\u2019t want to have that conversation, but sometimes, family is more precious than pride.

If I do anything wrong please tell me.\n\nI(70s F) am the grandmother to 5 wonderful grandkids (3 women and 2 men). The last of my grandkids got married last October. My husband (70s M) and I usually get them a small gift (usually the cheapest thing on the registry), then the day before the wedding, we privately gift them a check for $40k, we prefer that they use it for a house, but we don\u2019t force them to do so. We also ask them to keep it private (we have a big extended family, and we don\u2019t want them to expect it from us). They all honored this request.\n\nWhen it came to our youngest granddaughter, we bought her an air fryer (that was the cheapest thing on the registry) and sent it in advance. Then she called us furious, she went off on us for being cheap and how she knew we had money, but that we did not love her enough to show it by getting her something more expensive.\n\nWe were horrified by her behavior, then she went ahead and threatened to disinvite us if we didn\u2019t get her a better gift. We discussed it, bought her a China set, but we did not give her the money that was set aside for her. We decided that she did not deserve it.\n\nFast foreword to last week, she met up with her brother, they got to talking and she found out about the cash gift that he got. She asked her cousins and found out all of them got the same gift. She called us furious for discriminating against her. We told her that it was our money, and after how she behaved, we did not want to give it to her.\n\nShe started crying, said that she was just extremely stressed, and that we shouldn\u2019t have taken it to heart. We told her that we stand by our decision. Now she is refusing to attend Christmas, and her mother (our DIL) is calling us AHs. So AWTAs.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Her behavior was atrocious, she is not entitled to your money. \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d consider giving it to her at a later date (birth of a child, some other milestone) IF she doesn\u2019t continue to act like a spoiled child.", "Absolutely NTA! Stress is not an excuse for ungrateful, entitled and manipulative behavior. And your DIL stepped way over the line.  It is not her business how you choose to use your money. And the fact that she seems to be excusing her daughter's behavior is a good indication of where the entitlement comes from.  I am sorry this happened. I imagine it was a joy to give your grandkids such a nice start to their married lives.  Being coerced and manipulated into giving is not a joyful experience.", "NTA. Sit her and her mother down and explain to her what you did with the others and why you did it. You always got the cheapest on the registry and then the money before the day of the wedding. You tried doing the same with her but she called you berating you for your \"cheap gift\" demanding you buy her something else. Because of her actions of entitlement means she got what she originally wanted....an expensive gift, therefore she gets no money.", "Nta", "Defiantly not the asshole. When I got married none of my grandparents were alive. I would have rather have them there instead of a present from them. She's just acting very entitled and spoiled.", "Definitely NTA. My husband and I are separated but I still have a relationship with one of my step sons. The other one only calls when he wants something. Guess who I\u2019m spending Christmas Eve with and guess who\u2019s child is getting presents.", "NTA. She's obviously spoiled. If you are worried about fairness, you can put it aside as a future gift to her or her kids if you ever feel a need to give it to her. Just don't tell her you did it.", "NTA - you got your granddaughter something from her registry. It\u2019s not her job to count your money. Who is to say that your financial situation hadn\u2019t changed since the last grandchild\u2019s wedding? \n\nThe stress of planning a wedding does not excuse your granddaughter\u2019s entitlement. Wedding culture has really gotten out of hand.", "NTA, she doesn\u2019t deserve anything", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences. She just learned the cost of being a spoiled jack ass", "Stressed or not, I think you made the right decision. She is turning everyone against you on this instead of truly acknowledging her mistake and showing contrition. Maybe in a couple of years you would have gifted it to her, there has to be some lesson learned, but instead she continued to show she was a spoiled brat.\n\nAlso, an air fryer is a nice gift. What was she asking for that that an air fryer \u201cwasn\u2019t good enough\u201d.", "NTA. Thank you for not enabling her entitlement!  Hopefully she becomes a better person from this experience.", "NTA, I can\u2019t believe anyone would purposely call to complain about a gift, how spoiled and entitled can one person be? She doesn\u2019t deserve the money bc she showed you who she really is.", "NTA. For my wedding my ex and I got a few presents that I wouldn\u2019t give, it wasn\u2019t any where close to anything on our registry and probably costed all of $5. Not only did I NOT complain, I graciously thanked them the same as I did everyone else in put it in our house where it was seen by all. I didn\u2019t even try to hide it. It was a home decoration that to me was ugly as sin. Oh well, that comes with the territory and it wasn\u2019t so horrible that anyone would be embarrassed by them. They just weren\u2019t good gifts. Your granddaughter sounds like a very spoiled brat and she showed her true colors. You responded to her behavior. You\u2019re perfectly right in my opinion!", "NTA. \n\nIf you were my grandmother and gotten me an air fryer, I would be happy to have received the gift and sent you a thank you card. \n\nI know that not everyone can afford a wedding gift, so I would just be happy to see you to be able to make the effort to show up at the wedding. If all what you could have gotten me is that, I would be content. \n\n$40,000 is a lot of money, and you want to make sure that they don't blow it. Her behavior shows that there is such a risk, so that makes you NTA twice over. \n\nI am looking into houses these days and if I would get a $40,000 gift, it's a 10% downpayment on a family-sized home in a family-friendly suburb of Houston TX that both my boyfriend and I would be very happy to own one day: https://redf.in/qanzZF\n\nFor the right person, it is a life-changing gift that starts their marriage on the right foot.

If you still want to give the money to her, at least wait until she shows some insight and humility.", "That is some serious entitled, brat behavior. Absolutely NTA, you were kind enough to get the china set because frankly she didn\u2019t even deserve that.", "NTA, not at all!", "NTA your granddaughter is a spoiled brat. I cannot believe she acted that way not once but twice. She threatened to disinvite you over a gift? Please do not give her the money.

You should stand by your decision and when your DIL calls you and AH you need to tell her \"well you would know since you raised one\". It may be petty to say but it is your money that you have worked hard for and no one is entitled to it. Certainly not someone who is viscious one moment and apologizing only AFTER they find out they lost out big. This is like the princess and the pea story but more modern. People should be grateful for what they have and they should treat their family with respect. Maybe I have crossed over to \"old school\" now that I am 35 but I just was taught better than that. My grandmother (80) would turn me over her knee if I ever talked to her like that.

She told you she viewed you guys as a wallet, and cared about getting money out of you over than actually having you at her wedding. That cash gift is a family gift. She said she didn't view you as family and so you followed that energy.\n\nIt sounds like she shouldn't attend Christmas since that is an event for family and friends, and she is neither family or a friend she has proclaimed", "NTA!! \n\nLet me tell you a personal story.. my grandparents saved well and lived VERY frugally. By the time my grandfather passed away, my gram was left with enough money that she could have lived 100 more years without ever having to worry about a thing. She also lived well below her means. \n\nEvery Christmas after he died when I was a teenager (she didn\u2019t like to drive my grandpa always did all the driving) she would always get me 1 gift and 1 $50 gift card. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget the Christmas I opened up the UGLIEST mint green sweater I\u2019ve ever seen in my life! LOL When I say this sweater was god awful that is being kind to it\u2026.it was truly terrible! Hahaha \n\nI looked over at her biting her lower lip with a look of hope on her face, and gave her the brightest most genuine smile. I told her I absolutely LOVED IT! I gave her the biggest hug, thanking her profusely. I\u2019ve never seen her look so happy. \n\nDespite her including a gift receipt, I kept that sweater, and I wore that sweater often when I\u2019d go to visit her. As much as I truly hated the way that sweater looked, I really did love it. I loved it because I knew the effort my elderly grandmother put into driving (which terrified her) out to the mall (which she hated) to personally shop for me, and try to find something she thought I would like. That meant everything to me! \n\nYears later she still would cry as she told my dad, that out of all of her many grandchildren- I was the only one who EVER thanked her\u2026.year after year after year everyone else took her for granted until she was gone. I could NEVER imagine treated my grandparents this way!! \n\nMy point is you are NTA!! please keep your money. It\u2019s yours and even if you do give her a check- she will still never appreciate you for it. She will still take you for granted\u2026.

Go on Gma!\n\nThe correct response to a gift is \"Thank you!\" For my wedding, my grandmother detailed my car so when we got home from our honeymoon I had a sparkling ride.

Finally made a mends with dad in hospital. Opened bible and found a check written in it for the amount of the car he wanted.", "NAH.  Since you have done this for all of your grandchildren and the fact that you give them an additional gift should have been common knowledge amongst all of your grandchildren as they got married.  Your youngest grandchild has been well aware of your wealth as she was growing up.  She must have been aware her siblings/cousins got this generous gift from you when they got married.  Unless you explained this too her prior to her wedding, I could see where she would be upset.  \n\nMy grandparents gave to their grandchildren equally and were a little more financially secure as we were growing up.

I think the story indicates there\u2019s a possibility of gaslighting in the family, or maybe this daughter is less favored by her parents so she\u2019s extra sensitive. \n\nI\u2019m working on Christmas right now, and just this morning I was thinking about gifts that felt like backhanded slaps.

Also to me an air fryer being the cheapest thing on there is kind of a gauge. The cheapest one I can see where I am is \u00a3100 discounted because of the season but \u00a3150 seems standard for an average one.\n\nThat\u2019s straying into Le Creuset price point for me which would be unusual to be the cheapest bracket on a registry.

Like, I really hate to break it to you, but the kindest people on earth have judgment that falters sometimes. \n\nNot to mention, that *highly problematic* statement was made based on extremely limited information. Have you considered that they purchased a cheap gift initially because they were planning to give a much larger gift closer to the wedding? Or that they asked their family members to keep such large gifts secret in case their financial circumstances changed and they couldn\u2019t meet expectations for similar gifts in the future? \n\nIf the grandchild was hurt by the original gift, there were ways to express that appropriately.

It\u2019s on their granddaughter to show them that they are more then a checkbook to her.", "Grand daughter lashed out as she felt entitled to someone else's money. Then when confronted with the consequences of her actions gave a poor excuse in an attempt to absolve her of responsibility for her actions. Now she is trying to manipulate them to get what she wants and her mother is supporting that.\n\nTantrum after tantrum has been thrown and she won't take responsibility and show contrition and change. \n\nNTA. Grand daughter nuked her bridge out of petty greed and self entitlement and has shown she is a manipulative person.", "You didn\u2019t read it right at all did you, they got every grandchild the cheapest gift on the registry not just her! She bitched so they bought China also on the registry. Btw a very good air fryer is like over \u00a3100 so not really cheap either but add fine China on it they spent at least a good \u00a3500 over all in total", ">I have an air fryer and there's nothing better\n\nThere is! I have TWO airfryers. It's awesome being able to do fries and onion rings at the same time. Or meat and chicken. Or or or. Just awesome.\n\nOP, you couldn't be farther from AH territory.", "I\u2019m horrified at her behavior. And her doubling down and wanting to not attend Christmas", "Air fryers are awesome!", "It says a lot that an air fryer was the cheapest thing in her registry", "Same. Next to my kitchen aid mixer, my air fryer is my best friend in the kitchen!", "This. I absolutely know my cousins received much more as a wedding gift than I did. I said nothing. My mom was offended but I was clear that it really didn't make a difference to me. I have known for years where I stood, and have made peace with it. So I was absolutely expecting something similar. But nope. NTA. And agreed, air fryers are the best. When I make lists, I put a range of priced items on it to account for everyone situation or willingness and I also never expect anything.", "It may very well have been the cheapest thing on the directory, while still providing the most utility or being the most quality.", "I\u2019m asking for a new George Foreman grill because the nonstick coating is coming off of mine lol. NTA you gave her something on her registry so it\u2019s something she wanted. Just because you\u2019re \u201cloaded \u201c doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s entitled to anything. Do people not get told anymore that you\u2019re supposed to appreciate that someone got you something at all?", "But they did, it might be valuable but it is the cheapest. \n\nI've bought tons of cheap things that have ended up being super valuable due to how much use i get out of it versus other more expensive things.", "Patience is a virtue and had she a little more of it!", "I\u2019ve been teaching myself how to cook and trying to gain more independence in the kitchen. I would be overjoyed with an air fryer!", "Calling your grandparents  yelling at them and threatening to uninvite them for getting you a perfectly reasonable gift isn't a mistake, it's shitty and greedy.", "There is no amount of stress that would have me yelling at my grandparents to give me a better gift or else they couldn\u2019t be at my wedding. Just, no. Now is this a much larger consequence than most of us would face? One that sets her back in life compared to siblings and cousins? Yes. But just like the dudes who shouldn\u2019t get off with easy sentencing because it will hurt their futures, she shouldn\u2019t get a pass on terrible behavior. She didn\u2019t get the boost to her future because SHE, not they, did wrong. If she improves in life, I might consider makeup gift for another life event or contribution to a down payment. But not anything related to the wedding she was ready to kick them out of and probably not the full 40k", "No way, she dug her own grave.", "Stress caused her to become rude and selfish, not once  but twice. She only called the second time when she realized she had messed up. She deserves nothing. In fact, no one ever \"deserves\" a gift. Show that you are ungrateful? She lost her chance at a life changing gift. Her fault.", "If her wedding is stressful it\u2019s because of her, no doubt.  Never in a million years could I imagine calling up a family member or wedding guest to bitch about the gift I got them.", "Lol your heart broke for her? I\u2019m glad she screwed herself with her shitty behavior.", ">In her shoes, you would wonder if you had offended the grandparents, if they valued you, or if maybe the grandparents were in financial trouble or cognitive decline.\n\nSo your response to any of those worries is to call furious that you didn't get a more expensive gift?", "Doesnt matter if it was about testing or not. Who receives a gift they put on their own registry(doesn\u2019t matter the price) and immediately calls the sender to chastise them for the price of a gift. No one with class who isnt spoiled, it should have been a call to thank them for the gift and discuss how excited they are for the grandparents to attend the upcoming wedding. She gets what she deserves from all of the ways she handled it.", "> so wasn\u2019t there some kind of cousins/siblings in joke about OP and Grandparent being cheap/old fashioned wedding gifters?\n\nI don\u2019t see why there would be? I have no clue what my brother and cousins were gifted by family at weddings.", "Right? I think I bought mine for $70, but that\u2019s still a high price item to be the cheapest thing on the registry. Not everyone can afford a $70 wedding gift but still want to help out in what ways they can.", "I would think it more likely that word had gotten around that the grandparents were very generous wedding gifters. (Just without the details. Whose gonna badmouth them after getting $40K?) And she\u2019s probably aware that her grandparents are well off.\n\nTotally speculating, but this granddaughter might be the last and also the least, and there might be decades worth of resentments behind her finally blowing up at them.

LOL.", "That's what I was thinking, too. Just bypass the greedy granddaughter entirely.", "It seems like it's a good thing that you did get her the gift in advance.\n\nWith her \"charming personality\" she just saved you $40k. What a sweet heart.", "Grandma your granddaughter behaved badly - no doubt about it. But my father played games with money - swooping in at the last minute like a hero, keeping secrets, etc. It\u2019s obnoxious.", "It depends on the size and brand, an air fryer can cost anywhere between 50 to 300 bucks.", "Yeah mine is around that price but it is very small and basically just for fries and nuggets lol.", "I\u2019m glad you added that. You might want to include it in your post. I\u2019m curious about who she is as a person that thinks her behavior was okay. Are you very close?", "Honestly, at least it exposes her green to the rest of the family!", "Lol that\u2019s why I said \u201cif she can get a loan\u201d because something tells me this girl has horrible credit.", "OP also followed up to point out that the only reasons other cousins mentioned it to her was because they assumed she had also gotten it. And they were not upset about it.", "I get your point, but if she was smart she would have at least waited for the wedding to see if they got her something else. I had several people get us early wedding gifts, which turned out to just be engagement gifts, because they also wrote us generous checks and gave them to us in cards at our actual wedding. \n\nRegardless, I cannot imagine calling up any of them and complaining about a gift.", "OP says \"she threatened to uninvite them from the wedding\", i.e. she found out before the wedding. I didn't say they were obligated to give it to her, I said they're also AHs for putting ALL the grandchildren in this situation.", "Info: how did the other 4 grandkids feel about how she acted towards you when she complained to them", "Don\u2019t listen to this person OP they\u2019re delusional. With a registry the idea is for guests to buy something off it. You do and graciously gift 40 grand as well. 4 other children had the manners not to say anything. Even if you only got her an air fryer it\u2019s incredibly dissapointing that she would call and shame you as she did for a gift. After her behavior she\u2019s lucky she even got the air fryer. You guys are awesome for saving up and helping your grandkids get a good start in life that money could go a long way. Your incredible people, your youngest granddaughter, well she may be a good person but her entitled behavior speaks for herself in this instance. NTA", "Omg I adore you and desperately wish I had grandparents!", "NTA - Play entitle games get stupid prizes!! It\u2019s does not matter what anyone else thinks!! ITS YOUR MONEY. The fact that she called and shouted at you is enough disrespect to warrant not giving her anything else! I would have done the same!!", "Please ignore that comment! You haven't done anything wrong. \n\nMy grandparents also had a lot of money, but I never in my life felt that I was entitled to that money or to big gifts. In fact, with my wedding I specifically asked not to give gifts.\n\nBig hug to you, I hope the rest of the family has your back. You have done absolutely nothing wrong.", "Grandma, I would have loved an air fryer. You are very kind and loving. \n\nDo what you think is best. Just a couple questions for you to consider. And I am no way justifying her behavior. \n\nYour intent is to help your grandchildren. Could this be a learning moment for your granddaughter?  Does one huge and awful lapse of judgement change how you feel about her core? I\u2019m assuming you still love her. Let her prove that it was a one time thing. Weddings bring out the worst in some people. This could change her life (and I\u2019m not talking about money). If she loses the entitlement now she will have better relationships with her children.\n\nI\u2019m petty AF so I don\u2019t care what you do. I just know how I feel about my daughter (no grandkids). This would be a learning moment and maybe to the tune of a smaller amount.", "I\u2019m sorry but no it it is totally a test or else you would tell them all ahead of time instead of keeping it hush hush. Do you not realize the optics of the wealthiest people in the family giving the worst gift making you seem like cheap people who don\u2019t care about your family? ESH all the way.

Spectacular for cooking multiple things, as you say, but also for reheating leftovers. No more soggy pizza or fries in this house! And we've used both to reheat leftovers that needed different temp/time. Or reheat leftovers and cook a side. Or make two sides. \n\nI pretty much live by my air fryers and instant pots \ud83d\ude02", "Sounds like no great loss to be honest", "Probably for the best if that\u2019s her attitude.

They'd repeatedly skip my birthday to go to their place down south for the winter. They'd often leave less than a week before my birthday. One of the few times they did come, my grandmother described her surgery in vivid detail for over 30 minutes. \n\nBut hey! At least they felt a little guilty the first time they dropped several grand on my cousin so they got me a GameBoy!

It's being discreet. You clearly have your own family issues and you are projecting", "Agreed. I just didn\u2019t want claireclairey to misjudge someone based on an outdated assumption. I know it\u2019s the grandparents asking the questions, but really we are also judging the grandchild too so we should try to be as fair as possible.", "Would they be called \u201cair fries\u201d?", "Mmmmm fries and nuggets.

But she might be a very hot headed person or extremely emotional right now\u2014idk I don\u2019t know her. She made a mistake CLEARLY. \n\nI definitely think this whole situation could be handled better with a conversation than these aggressive phone calls and I\u2019m not sure this grandchild ever got that education based on her mom\u2019s behavior. I went NTA on my verdict but I still think this is a situation that could break a family and should be handled with all care and consideration. Any large amount has that power. Family dynamics are complicated and nuanced, and people grow and change. I\u2019d rather this grandparent take a more careful approach to this than some of these quick NTA verdicts I\u2019m seeing.

Like why even comment here if you're just going to disregard everything OP says.", "Why am I picturing three air fryers with matching outfits and cute names? :D", "If you have reasonably wealthy grandparents and they\u2019ve given you only a small cheap gift so far, maybe consider that the registry gift might not be the only gift?  And it\u2019s not even your wedding day yet, so maybe chill on the gift nonsense\u2026", "I mean, I can\u2019t make them at the same time, it\u2019s that small, but a friend gave it to me brand new because she already had another one, and every so often I tell my son: this is the best present I have ever gotten, friend is so amazing, lol.", "That makes it even worse. So in addition to a gift, to attend the wedding you had to spend money on plane tickets and accommodations.  \n\nYou are entirely in the right, and the next time your DIL complains about it tell her she should have raised her daughter with some manners and grace.", "I\u2019m sorry she is like this. She kinda stabbed her self in the foot here.", "Stand strong OP\n NTA     \n\nSpoilt and ungrateful", "Why do you assume the approach they are taking is not carefully thought out or a reflection of them knowing their grandchild? Their granddaughter has used emotional manipulation twice to try and get more money out of them. Perhaps they are not comfortable with fostering a relationship with someone who views them as a piggy bank. \n\nIn my opinion, it\u2019s on the granddaughter to make amends and fix the relationship. If she\u2019s old enough to get married, she\u2019s old enough to be told honestly how her actions made her grandparents feel and the consequences of those actions.

You don\u2019t have to agree. I just thought a lot of the replies I\u2019ve seen seemed hasty to say NTA but didn\u2019t really take into account the fall out or the possible lead up to this situation. I wasn\u2019t disagreeing with you so I don\u2019t know why you seem so frustrated with my reply.

It's not a test. Also, it's very common for older people to be extremely private and quiet about large gifts of money.
