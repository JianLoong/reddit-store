The man who hit me gave me his contact and insurance information. TBH my dumbass didn\u2019t want to get the police involved as I was already running late and this was a very important flight to catch. The elderly man kept going on and on about how he was a Christian (this should have been my first red flag) and that, as a man of God, he would be agreeable and helpful, admitting fault, when my insurance company contacted him. My gut said to go ahead and get the cops involved but there was minimal damage to the car and I simply didn\u2019t have the time. Well, you can guess how this all turned out. Bottom line: nothing came of the claim so I had to pay out-of-pocket for the damages.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I was driving down a residential street that had cars parked on both sides. A few streets away, a church was having a Thanksgiving food drive for not-well-off families. The first 200 cars in the line would get a turkey and other foods to celebrate Thanksgiving  with. (I didn\u2019t know any of this at the time).\n\nThe short version is that I had the right of way and a car pulled out and smashed into my driver\u2019s door. Nobody was hurt but there was significant damage to the car. The woman that hit me (maybe in her 50\u2019s?) didn\u2019t exit the vehicle to see if I was ok or to inspect the damage. She meerily sat in her car and waited for me to approach. Didn\u2019t say sorry, or look remorseful, simply handed me her information and nonchalantly said, \u201chere\u2019s my information. Just have your insurance company call me. I need to go.\u201d\n\nI straight up told her that she can\u2019t leave. I intended to get the police involved because I wanted all the info on record. At first she was angry, saying that she *needed* to get in the church line for a turkey. I basically shrugged and said, \u201cYou can leave but I wouldn\u2019t advise leaving the scene of an accident. I\u2019m calling the cops either way.\u201d\n\nAt this point she burst into tears and said that her family couldn\u2019t afford a turkey this year - her husband lost his job and they were on welfare and that I was essentially robbing her children of a Thanksgiving feast.\n\nI was so upset by the whole situation that I just shrugged and walked away and called the police from my car. The whole ordeal took at least an hour and a half but everything got resolved. \n\nBut today, now that my anger has dwindled, I\u2019m starting to wonder if I should have not gotten the police involved and let her get in line and just dealt with insurance myself. Kind of feeling like a d***. \n\nAITA for potentially ruining her kids\u2019 Thanksgiving?", "created_utc": 1669125394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1u7lh/aita_for_potentially_ruining_a_welfare_familys/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She crashed into you but that's transformed into you ruining her event!", "NTA you should always file a report because people often try to find a way to make themselves blameless. \n\nShe robbed her kids a thanksgiving feast by not looking where she was going.\n\nYou have her address from the report. Can you bring her a turkey and the trimmings? If you or some of your friends can afford it, that would be an idea.", "NTA. She hit your car and you have every right to call the police and document the accident.", "NTA. Wrong is wrong, regardless of the back story. Everyone has a sad story these days, but it isn't an excuse to act recklessly.", "NTA.   Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice shame on me.  Well done for not allowing yourself to get scammed twice.", "NTA.  I'm not even convinced that she actually needed the turkey, or even had kids. Her behavior after hitting you smacks of entitlement.  You recognized the odds of getting burned a second time.", "NTA. She ruined Thanksgiving by pulling into traffic without looking.", "NTA - you've already experienced what can happen if you don't get a proper report going, so it's only natural you'd insist on getting police involved.\n\nHer background, tragic as it may be, isn't your concern. You can feel bad for her, but at at same time you have done nothing to feel guilty about.", "NTA.\n\nEven if her story was true, you aren't the one who \"ruined\" her Thanksgiving - *she* ruined it herself by disobeying traffic laws, smashing into you, and causing significant damage. That's completely and totally understand on her. She didn't give a crap about how the damage (that *she* caused) would impact your Thanksgiving, or Christmas. She fully expected you to eat the (significant) cost of repairs with absolutely no regard for how it would impact your (likely younger) family.\n\nYou should feel no guilt in this. Sorrowful that the incident happened and she missed out on a free turkey, maybe, but no guilt.", "NTA. She hit you. That sucks for both of you. If you are really down about it you have her info, buy her a turkey. But really, how do you know she wasn't just trying to get you to tell \"oh go ahead, it will be ok\" because there are people who have insurance info but haven't actually paid so you get screwed in the end", "NTA She was going to flake. 100 percent. She did not care. And a Thanksgiving meal, while nice, is NOT a necessity! Having food in general absolutely is, but a turkey, no. She hit you. If you had hit her, absolutely I would have gone with her to a store after calling the police and bought her a Thanksgiving meal because then you would have been responsible for her missing out on the free one. But she was the one solely responsible for missing out on the turkey, which again, is a luxury.", "NTA \nYou don't even know she was going for that turkey (I know...I sound harsh...but how do you really know?)\nAlso, I understand not wanting to get burned again with a car accident...it su*ks\ud83d\ude21 and unfortunately makes you want and need to do everything correctly the next time~such as call the police for an accident report.\nI don't think you did anything wrong.", "Nope you did nothing wrong.  You were burned once by the first man.  You were more cautious the second time and did it by the book.  NTA\n\n>Kind of feeling like a d\\*\\*\\*\n\nYou would be a d\\*\\*\\* if after the first time you didnt learn and made the same exact mistake the second time.  Then youd practically be asking to be taken advantage of.  By a man of god, a good christian like the first guy told you.", "NTA. Turkeys aren\u2019t compulsory at Thanksgiving.", "I appreciate your empathy for someone who could possibly be in a tough spot. From what you described, you did the right thing. It\u2019s inconvenient for both people. Whether she was being honest or just trying to get out of responsibility, either way you did the right thing.", "You aren\u2019t an A for protecting yourself. You can be NTA and still have compassion for the person who clearly was having a horrible day. It sounds like this happened because she was more focused on getting a meal for her family than watching the road, and that\u2019s a heartbreaking situation to be in.\n\nDoes your country have online claims? I file a claim on the spot using my insurance app on my phone with the other person\u2019s information and relevant photos. They let me know what/how things will be covered almost immediately.", "NTA, but save their Thanksgiving and buy them a turkey. You have her info.", "INFO : is it common where you live to involve the police in every car accident ?", "Nta", "NTA- I would have done the same thing. Been bit by the insurance company a time or two myself.", "NTA. You didn't rob her of anything. She didn't have a turkey that you took from her, she had the possibility of a turkey if she got to the church on time and if she was one of the first 200 cars. There is no guarantee she would have been even if she hadn't hit your car. And she did hit your car. She caused thousands in property damage, and then she couldn't even be bothered to get out and see if you were okay. You're a good person for feeling badly about this, but you don't need to.", "NTA. You don\u2019t know for sure that that\u2019s where she was heading. You have to protect yourself. She wasn\u2019t even nice about the thing.\n\nBut just in case it were true, I would have offered to pay for a turkey if I could or to follow her in the line and handle the whole accident afterwards, so that she doesn\u2019t fly out, but still gets a chance for the food. It\u2019s either time consuming or costly for you who have nothing to do with the fact that she didn\u2019t drive properly and hit you, so I won\u2019t call you an asshole for not doing so, but you would sure be extra compassionate and nice if you did.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Seek therapy for that. A turkey isn\u2019t enough of a reason to not do right by someone you have hit. There are lots of other ways to get a turkey. She was being a dxck and you shouldn\u2019t feel guilty.", "NTA", "YTA", "NTA but you messed up. The \"good Christian man\" screwed you so you were too careful with the poor family.\n\nProblem is in 5 year's time you will feel mild annoyance with the Christian man but will still feel guilty about the family.\n\nIt's always better to err on the side of compassion. Because if you're a good person (not a Christian) then you will feel guilt far more strongly when you were not compassionate.\n\nCompared to the annoyance of being screwed for being naive compassionate.", "YTA. You threw a little baby tantrum and ruined some children's Thanksgiving, on purpose, because their mom reminded you of someone you were mad at. Seeing that offer for Thanksgiving probably felt like a holiday miracle to them, and you crushed it, because you couldn't hurt the person you were mad at and you just had to hurt someone.", "NTA\n\nShe ruined her children's thanksgiving by being a bad driver.\n\nAlso where I come from, poor people can't afford cars, so it all sounds too much like a first world problem for me to feel bad about her.", "I would not go to her house. \n1) they often redact addresses on the report\n2) she could accuse OP of something to get back at him", "Yeah, and watch OP pull up to a big ol house. Do they actually put the other person's address on there? That seems really dangerous", "It depends on the damage. I was hit the other week, she made a u-turn into me & hit the driver door. I called my insurance to make sure they got my side & I wasn't at fault. The police wouldn't file a report because there was no significant damage or injuries, it was too minor.", "OP absolutely should not do that. The first thing a poor person would think after getting into an accident would not be about not getting a turkey, it would be about how the heck they would pay for the accident! Even with insurance it is going to at least make your monthly payment more. As a poor person, I would be terrified about the cost, not worrying about getting a turkey", "It\u2019s strongly advised to get the police involved because of situations like the one that happened to me last year. But it\u2019s not a legal requirement to my knowledge. Also it may be contingent on how bad the accident was and if there is any harm to the ppl involved. But I\u2019m not exactly sure.", "Where I am the cops really only come if you're on public property or there's injury.  I was hit in a parking lot and we just had our insurances deal with it. I did have to send pictures and a detailed map of the area.", "I live in southern USA and yes it is common to have the police involved. Insurance companies prefer to pay when they are involved. Otherwise it is drawn out and often one has to pay out of pocket like OP stated in the beginning of post.", "No.", "She does not need to feel guilty. The woman showed zero remorse for hitting her. Drivers in the US are required to have car insurance for a reason and insurance companies usually need a police report to pay out. The women was careless and damaged someone else\u2019s car. OP shouldn\u2019t have to get stuck with all the expenses. The driver who hit her is lucky she didn\u2019t physically harm OP.", "NTA the person who hit her car and then wanted to do the hit and run actually ruined her own thanksgiving.", "I agr\u00e9e that OP is NTA. But I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from but plenty of needy people in the US have cars. We have a lot of \u201cworking poor\u201d here which means they may have one or even multiple jobs but are still not making enough to cover all their basic needs - especially single mothers (men leave and don\u2019t follow through on support obligations). Even if she had a \u201cnice\u201d car she might be in a position where she needs assistance feeding her family. Bottom line you cannot judge a person\u2019s needs based on the fact that they have a car.", "They do. I had an interaction with a crazy old lady once that didn\u2019t result in anything but the officers took note of the incident and handed me a card with her address, and presumably gave her one with mine.\n\nShe\u2019s super lucky I\u2019m not a psycho. She definitely was a psycho but luckily she never did anything to me that i know of haha", "Tell me you're not a poor person without telling me you're not a poor person.\n\nBeing broke rearranges your immediate worries, not to mention priorities. The inability to put food on the table extends beyond the physical effects of an empty stomach, it is absolutely soul-crushing. If you have ever felt worthless, magnify it x1,000, then making yourself get up and try again anyway because wallowing doesn't help the hunger pangs of your children.\n\nSorry for the rant. It's easy to imagine that you know something without having experienced it. I was guilty of that, but life taught me the reality.", "Yep, you're an AH too."]}
