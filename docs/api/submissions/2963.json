The man who hit me gave me his contact and insurance information. TBH my dumbass didn\u2019t want to get the police involved as I was already running late and this was a very important flight to catch. The elderly man kept going on and on about how he was a Christian (this should have been my first red flag) and that, as a man of God, he would be agreeable and helpful, admitting fault, when my insurance company contacted him. My gut said to go ahead and get the cops involved but there was minimal damage to the car and I simply didn\u2019t have the time. Well, you can guess how this all turned out. Bottom line: nothing came of the claim so I had to pay out-of-pocket for the damages.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I was driving down a residential street that had cars parked on both sides. A few streets away, a church was having a Thanksgiving food drive for not-well-off families. The first 200 cars in the line would get a turkey and other foods to celebrate Thanksgiving  with. (I didn\u2019t know any of this at the time).\n\nThe short version is that I had the right of way and a car pulled out and smashed into my driver\u2019s door. Nobody was hurt but there was significant damage to the car. The woman that hit me (maybe in her 50\u2019s?) didn\u2019t exit the vehicle to see if I was ok or to inspect the damage. She meerily sat in her car and waited for me to approach. Didn\u2019t say sorry, or look remorseful, simply handed me her information and nonchalantly said, \u201chere\u2019s my information. Just have your insurance company call me. I need to go.\u201d\n\nI straight up told her that she can\u2019t leave. I intended to get the police involved because I wanted all the info on record. At first she was angry, saying that she *needed* to get in the church line for a turkey. I basically shrugged and said, \u201cYou can leave but I wouldn\u2019t advise leaving the scene of an accident. I\u2019m calling the cops either way.\u201d\n\nAt this point she burst into tears and said that her family couldn\u2019t afford a turkey this year - her husband lost his job and they were on welfare and that I was essentially robbing her children of a Thanksgiving feast.\n\nI was so upset by the whole situation that I just shrugged and walked away and called the police from my car. The whole ordeal took at least an hour and a half but everything got resolved. \n\nBut today, now that my anger has dwindled, I\u2019m starting to wonder if I should have not gotten the police involved and let her get in line and just dealt with insurance myself.

Our auto insurance cards have the address listed too.", "Police reports generally have nothing to do with fault in insurance. \n\nUnless the police *witnessed* the collision why would we assume what they say is fact? All they do is *ask* both driver's what happened and choose a narrative they believe. Sometimes if the police are good, they write each driver's narrative on the report.", "Idk I hit a parked car (I'm a very bad driver) and left them a note. Police were not involved because I didn't know where the owner went. I insurance covered everything just fine for both me and the cars owner who did call me later that day", "*her conscience", "USAA made me jump through so many hoops to get a claim when I was a passenger in my moms car and we got tboned by a semi. It was shared fault. We had full coverage but they pushed to not cover my kids ambulance ride (he needed stitches in his forehead) and my medical bills and missed income because I fractured my skull. They kept switching the form that they wanted and the hospital took forever to fill them out so the 2 year mark came and if I got a lawyer it would have been extended but I couldn\u2019t afford the upfront fees for that. I didn\u2019t have many lasting affects from my injury besides my teeth breaking, so I just let it go. After 2 years\u2026..", "That\u2019s what he did with us. We each received separate forms to fill out, depicting what we went down. Luckily, there were eye witnesses so she couldn\u2019t really lie even if she wanted to.", "Can confirm grew up poor, most of the people who lived around me drove cars with cosmetic damage at the very least, often having far more serious problems. As an adult I get panicky when it is time to go grocery shopping, at first because I have very little food in my house but then at checkout I'm terrified my card will be declined or something and I'll have to go hungry (irrational, and I am aware of it, but it was a thing that occurred regularly in my childhood.)", "Lol clearly no one agrees with you. But, I'm sure you'll only stick harder to your opinion rather than attempt to understand why.", "That story makes my blood boil. Omggggg I\u2019m so sorry you had to deal with that!! FUCK insurance companies - ALL OF THEM", "Just remember it becomes \u201cundrivable\u201d if the air bags go off, even during a fender bender. There are other things too that kind of make me scratch my head.", "Your title is misleading. I fixed it for you : AITA for calling the police due to being hit by a car? \n\nNTA. She should have been looking. You did not potentially ruin her holiday..... she did that. Stop feeling guilty, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  You don't actually know for a fact that anything she said was true.  It's very possible that she just didn't feel like waiting, or that she thought she could pull a fast one one you. You really don't know what the reason for her being in a hurry was.  There's no shortage of people giving wild and untrue excuses to get out of bad situations.", "NTA. She quite probably lied to you. If she really had to go that badly for a turkey, she'd have gotten out and checked on you, apologizing profusely, explained the situation herself and BEGGED you. Instead she tried to guilt-trip you and didn't care at all about your well-being. Plus, \"her husband lost his job and they're on welfare\" but a car accident that'll shoot her insurance through the roof was basically a hand-wave situation for her? Yeah, I don't buy it at all.", "NTA she hit you she has to pay for the consequences.", "NTA, don't hit a car, get a turkey. See, it is easy.", "NTA - Once bitten and all that", "NTA - you learned your lesson the hard way. And, you didn't ruin their TG, she did by driving poorly.", "NTA. you should ALWAYS call the cops for a police report.  It\u2019s convenient for your insurance, and also prevents the other driver from later claiming, \u201cno, he hit ME\u201d and coming after you with a claim.", "Also if there's no report she could come later claiming injuries you could end up responsible for.  People in bad situations sometimes do bad things.", ">*I'm not even convinced that she actually needed the turkey, or even had kids. Her behavior after hitting you smacks of entitlement*.\n\nCame here to say this.  You don't know if her sad story is true or not, OP.  It could be that she was trying to play your kind sympathies.\n\nThere was a family in our area who became notorious for the number of free turkeys and other things the parents scored one year.  Once the city newspaper caught on to their game they were strongly criticized.\n\nNTA", ">ruined some children's Thanksgiving, on purpose, because their mom reminded you of someone you were mad at.\n\nWhat a terrible take. Literally google \"what to do after a car accident\" and you'll see that everything says to call the police. In some states it's required for any accident, but regardless of state law, every major insurance company asks you to do this. To not follow the requirements/recommendations of your auto insurance provider is setting you up to not get your claim paid out.\n\nIn a (now removed) thread, you literally are calling folks sociopaths for *doing what they are supposed to*. I cannot for the life of me figure out how you've made such stunning leaps here, but holy yikes. It couldn't *possibly* be that OP learned from a prior mistake and is now correcting it to ensure her car insurance *will actually* cover her damages. No, it must be that they're inflicting their rage at some poor, unsuspecting person, *obviously*.\n\nJust calm down and apply some rational thought next time.", "She wasn't so concerned was she? She didn't attempt to exit her car. Didn't apologise. Just handed OP her insurance card and acted all nonchalant with the 'have your company call me'. \n\nI would be shitting my pants and apologising to OP for the damage I had caused. I would also be worried about the insurance detectable. Instead she didn't give a fuck until OP wanted to file the police report.", "Uhhh insurance is more important than a turkey, of course she'd pay a deductible vs a turkey if it came down to it", "I've called the police and they've nicely responded to every fender bender I've ever been in.  It would never occur to me not to call.", "And always have a disposable camera in the emergency kit.", "Agreed, but they are proof a collision occurred where and when you say it did , what vehicles and drivers were involved, AND if the other driver admits fault, they can't take it back later.", "My point is that she wasn't concerned  at all about the damage to her car and his and the costs of it, she was focused on a free 40$ turkey", "back in the day (literally like the '60s), my mom got in a car accident and tweaked her neck. It was probably a minor injury at the time and she probably just needed  a neck brace but she didn't bother going to the hospital because why spend the money...\n\nThe difference between what that trip to the hospital would have been and how much my mother has spent dealing with her neck in the 50 plus years since. Ouch is all I have to say.", "If it makes you feel better the 2 accidents our cars have been in the reports have been no hassle. \n\nThe first one was on a military base where my commanders wife backed into husband... per my supervisor who watched it happen, she backed.up hard and fast almost causing the car to go on its side. They admitted fault and their insurance covered it. We got a piece of tail light as a going away gift. \n\nThe second one was early this year where a teenaged girl ended up swerving into our turning lane and hit the back end of our car. Police in tucson won't respond to small vehicle accidents, so no report. The girls insirance covered the cost. Which ended up to.be a but cuz it actually hurt our rear axle.", "I had a coworker that the police said was at fault for an accident. He was turning left, yellow blinking yield arrow. He stopped, looked, and went. At the same time the other person was going double down the road that curved up to the light and smacked into him. He was also given a ticket for \"speeding\", which the court threw out.", "Oh yea, that's a biggie. Those are very important."]}
