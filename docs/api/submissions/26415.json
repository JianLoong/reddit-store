I (m23) have been in a relationship with my gf(f23) for over a year and we were also friends before that from college. When we were in college we both got into Anime after watching some of the famous animes like Naruto, Bleach and Death Note, we went deeper into animes and after couple of months I drop that entire anime genre because of over sexualisation of teenage girl and all that incest plots and many more disturbing things. But compared to me my gf went far deeper into Anime section and started following it religiously like she attends our local anime convention and stuff like that. \n\n Recently my gf started doing this weird thing where she tries to add Japanese word in our everyday conversation. At first it was kinda cute but then it turned cringey and I even offered her to learn real Japanese language through my educational app access which was  given to me by my company where I work but she obviously declined. \n \nLast night gf was spending time at my place and we were just cuddling on couch watching tv suddenly  gf called me Onichan which literally means big brother and i gave her very disgusting look and told her that was creepy because I do have one younger sister, it was just instant reaction from my side. Least to say gf was not happy and she immediately booked a cab and left, I tried to salvage the situation but to no avail but now that I think about it I think  I am allowed have my opinions about certain things so just asking for advice.

Calling her a creep seems uncalled for but she did do it without asking, so I'm gonna say NTA, just be a bit nicer when people are into stuff you aren't", "I think it's a bit more gray that most people made it to be. \n\nOnii Chan and Onii San both mean older brother, but where Onii Chan is informal and specially use for member of the family, Onii San is a more formal term that can be use for your biological brother, an older male cousin, but also someone that isn't related to you. \n\nIf Onii San doesn't have a more sexual connotation in traditional Japanese culture, it's used in a similar manner than the South Korean word Oppa. But even if Oppa mean older brother, it often use in a more sexual connotation. I know there is a similar situation with a Chinese word, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to go into detail about that one.\n\nMy point is that language are not 100% copy of each other and in some Asian culture, brother and sister have developed a meaning of closeness more than familiarity something that is just alien to English and other western language.\n\nThere is also a bit joke about Oni Chan in the anime/manga culture. I don't know what the deeper meaning is in Japan, but honestly Onii Chan have become kind of a meme at this point. Just like the ''what are you doing step-bro'' have become a way to make fun of step-sibling porn in the west, I consider Onii Chan as a way to make fun of the creepy side of anime. \n\nHonestly, I would find it creepy if my GF would genuinely call me Onii Chan, but we both used the word as a sexual joke in some situation and it was funny. I think it's totally fine to find it creepy and an honest conversation would have been the mature way to deal with it.\n\nI mean common we all have kinks and the fear of being judged for them by our partner can lead to unhealthy relationship IMO. I think that making our relationship a safe place for our partner to share their sexual kinks without making them feel bad is just as important as enforcing out own boundaries about those kinks.\n\nBut maybe I'm looking too deep into it and I'm just bored at work lol.", "Nah\nYou are taking it to serious. But it's ok if that's your opinion. But she is not a creep, it's just her trying to be cute.\nBtw not an anime Fan, but your assumption of it being over sexualized and creepy is because of your choice of anime and not animes in general. There's millions of animes.\n\nThat like saying American movies have to much shooting. Might be true for action movies, but not if you watch law dramas.\n\nShe is not taking your opinion serious enough. \nTalk to each other for god's sake.\nShe is not a creep\nYou are allowed to say I don't want to be called that way.", "its true that oniichan means brother, and anime can get really fucking weird with it sometimes. but according to a friend of mine who was born and raised in japan. its not super weird for a younger woman to call an older man oniisan or oniichan if they are close. he said its still odd but not like gross or weird. you should apologize but i dont think yta. i definately get how its weird if your not really familar with japanese. i thought it was weird before i asked him. kinda suprised its not tbh.\n\n\nedit: to anyone curious apparently the distinction between brother and not brother is in how the word is enunciated. like midori is green but its also blue sometimes. even though ao is blue. idk its weird. hard to explain \nanyway words in japanese can get really complex i guess", "I think the term big brother isn't so literal. I watch Stephanie Soo on YouTube, she's Korean and explained that Unnie for example means big sister but it's not specifically your sister sometimes it's an older female figure in your life that you look up to and you can call her Unnie aswell.", "A little bit AH maybe. Calling her a creep is a little harsh, but it's fair to say \"I'm really uncomfortable with that.\" If you've talked with her before that you're uncomfortable with those particular plotlines with questionable sibling relationships, then she took it a bit to far and you're less of an AH, but you still could have phrased it better. \n\nUnfortunately it seems like your interests are not really aligned... You can try and set boundaries about what you're comfortable with, but that may make her feel like she can't be herself around you, which will eventually grate on her.  It does not bode well for your relationship, sorry.", "YTA slightly - not for feeling creeped out but by how you framed it. Rather than creep or cringe, I think uncomfortable would be more appropriate.\n\nThere's not enough here from her side to understand if she has a deeper understanding of the cultural context of the word usage, but yours context of the culture does seem pretty shallow an delimited to some media the you started watching and decided it was trash and avoided, based on your own description.\n\nShe might be a wee, or she might be developing a deeper sense of culture. But the word choice you reportedly used here is antagonistic enough it's likely going to shut down polite discourse. Not cringe or creepy, but uncomfortable. \n\nIt's likely both of you are fine as you are individually, but it's possibly the two of you have a different level mindsets when it comes to open mindedness and the ability to context switch between cultures. It's probably not a bad time to have a discussion and see if that difference is something doesn't grow as friction in the relationship.", "Anime is creepy and weird, NTA", "YTA.

Your woman isn't a woman lmao run", "YTA, I would do anything for a girl like that", "NTA, as a regular person who watches anime myself, I gotta admit that some animes take it too far with some of the stuff and its totally normal if you freak out in such a situation, I would too, honestly.

There\u2019s a whole lot of factors that can make a word more or less appropriate to refer to someone, which is true in all languages and cultures, but in Japanese it can sometimes be quite hard to parse a situation and know what\u2019s appropriate if you don\u2019t just stick to the safe options. \n\nThere are words where the accent pattern is the only thing that makes them not true homophones, but neither of the cases you mentioned are like that; it\u2019s just context. \n\nLast thing about blue and green in Japanese: it\u2019s actually a relatively recent distinction in Japanese to mark those two as separate colors and as weird as that may sound that\u2019s actually true with a fairly large number of other languages. For a long time ao was used to refer to both colors, but eventually midori mostly took over that semantic field. I should be sure to emphasize \u201cmostly\u201d since ao still is sometimes used to mean green, but again you just figure it out based on context. Learning a language is more than just memorizing words and grammar, you also need to develop an understanding of how that language categorizes the world and how that differs from what you\u2019re used to.", "I think it's still might be kinda creepy, since there supposed to be equal.

And while I do think OP tarring all anime with the same brush just because there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s gross is closed minded and foolish, it does make me wonder if the GF might be into that kind of thing.
