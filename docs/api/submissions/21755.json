You can / should be expected to pay for energy for your car. YTA. The way he went about it was fine", "EVs are still relatively rare vs gas cars, and as an EV owner your presumption should always be that people don't expect you to plug in an entire appliance and use their electricity for it. That would be like bringing a bunch of portable ACs or a ton of heaters and plugging them all in. People don't stipulate each and every condition into the terms, and this kinda goes way beyond reasonable use.\n\nMild YTA, and turning into a stronger YTA if you outright refuse to pay.", "YTA\n1. The host did not go \u201cscorched earth\u201d off the bat. He doesn\u2019t know you and can\u2019t be assured you would pay for the extra usage. He\u2019s covering himself financially, whether it\u2019s $1 or $2,000,000.\n\n2. As someone else pointed out already, you\u2019d pay for gas for your car if it were gas powered. You should expect to pay for the utility usage.\n\n3. You are one condescending person talking about, \u201ciF He hAD doNe BAsIc maTh\u2026\u201d. That\u2019s not the point. Not everyone drives electric cars right now, so additional fees aren\u2019t a normal thing for charging your vehicle at an AirBnB or anything else  of that type. Until it is, expect some places to react this way. Again, this is the host covering himself. Much like anywhere else.", "Light YTA. If the guy had a gasoline drum on the property, you would not assume it is free for you to fill up your car. You should have asked.", "Are you in downtown Halifax? There are quite a few places to charge EVs. YTA for supporting air bnbs when there is a huge issue of rental shortage and mass air bnb industry specifically in Halifax.", "Gentle YTA. You're perhaps his first EV and he'll need to figure out an ad change. It's up to you to pay for energy for your car though. The ad also didn't say \"free electricity for your EV\" so there's that.", "I would have asked first, so a gentle YTA and you should pay it.", "YTA. Just because you didn\u2019t like his approach doesn\u2019t make him any less right in the situation. If you drove a gas powered vehicle and he had a can of gas in the garage and you used it, shouldn\u2019t you pay for the gas? Same thing.", "YTA like others have stated if you has a gas powered car you\u2019d have to pay for gas and if you took gas from the host without permission it would be considered stealing. Your attitude seems quite entitled and reactionary. I\u2019m sure you can find a mutually agreeable payment to the host.", "Your real mistake was using AirBnB in the first place. Just a garbage company filled with places owned by garbage people contributing to a housing crisis to be shittier than the average hotel.", "Slightly YTA.  Perhaps tell the host ahead of time?  Negotiate upfront.", "YTA.   This is an extra cost that most do not just assume others will foot the bill for regardless of how little it costs.   He didn't go scorched earth btw, stop being so sensitive.   Him saying he expects you to pay for an unexpected cost is normal....get over yourself.", "YTA and  you need to ask if it's okay to charge your vehicle. Just becuase you think it's fine and dandy to do so. Doesn't make it so.\n\nThey are running that airB&B as a business and that buisness needs to run within a budget.\nPay them for charging your Model 3. You filled your so called tank on thier dime.", "Dude, don't be that guy that gives us Ontarians a bad name in the rest of the country! EV's aren't super popular here yet, and most of them have to have a special port installed by the energy company to charge the vehicle. The guy may not even be aware there were cars that COULD be just plugged into a random outlet to charge, or he may have expected you to charge at an actual charging station, like how people are expected to go to a gas station to fill the car, not use \"free gas\" they come across in the airbnb's garage. $22-$33 dollars extra cost is not an insubstantial amount. Especially these days when every dollar matters. You should have asked ahead of time about charging your car. And I say this as someone who hates the entire business model of airbnb's and what it's doing to the housing market!", "NTA. I manage a vacation rental and we have dedicated chargers. Your host is a cheapskate", "YTA - go to a public charger. It\u2019d be no different if you had a gas vehicle.", "YTA \n\nWhen the cost of utilities is included in a rental it's understood to be referring to hung utilities used within the property you're renting - heating, aircon, hot water, lighting etc . \n\nUnless the landlord stated in their Airbnb listing that EV charging is available / and is included in the fee then you are stealing something that isn't part of what you've paid for.", "You are incurring a nightly cost that probably amounts to 5 or 10% of his profit on the night, so it's not unreasonable for him to be concerned.  He didn't handle it very well.  Seems to me this should be something that can be solved amicably.  And you can reflect whatever happens in your review.  NTA.", "Good grief, YTA. Electricity isn't free!!! His approach wasn't wrong. You also didn't ASK, which would have been reasonable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know a lot of people with EVs and they don't feel they have to ask before plugging them in at an AirBnB. I've even reserved the place and had 2 cars that were other people's plugged in there. It never occurred to me it would be a problem. You can plug in your coffee maker that you love or your white noise machine. I'm sure you can plug in a pump for an air mattress you brought.
