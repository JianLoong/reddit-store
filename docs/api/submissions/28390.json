What happens if she gets another or, God forbid, wrecks this Honda you\u2019re supposedly financially secure enough to \u201cjust give to her?\u201d As someone else in the comments said, a discount is one thing. $9,000 isn\u2019t a discount, it\u2019s a robbery. \n\nIf that\u2019s all she\u2019s willing to spend, then she needs to find something at a used car lot that\u2019s in her price range and pay to put Interlock on that. Her horrible decision (no judgement, I myself have a DUI in my past) does not mean she deserves your spare SUV handed over to her. Firmly NTA.", "NTA imo. \n\nJust because she screwed up doesn't mean she's entitled to your stuff, nor is she entitled to a HUGE discount like that.

If someone is hurt because of her driving without a license and while drunk, you'll have a moral responsibility for enabling the harm.\n\nIf she's willing, help her find actual medically tested treatments for her drinking problems.  (Things that have been through scientific testing, multi-year longitudinal studies, double-blind tests with placebo, etc.) If she isn't willing, if you stay together, you need to work out something that will keep her and others around her safe when she drinks, which means an alternative to her ever driving.", "NTA. Don't fucking drink and drive.\n\nAnd don't give her any vehicle.", "You would only be TA if you let her have this car at all, whether she pays you for it or not. She got a DUI and lost her license over it- she can spend that money on Ubers to get where she needs to go, because that's one of the consequences of drinking and driving and she knew better. \n\nAnd besides, what if she drinks and drives again in *this* car and gets into a crash that costs someone their *life*? \n\nNTA.

If you genuinely wanted to gift her 75% of a car, sure, go for it, but it's clear that you are not comfortable with her DUI or gifting her such a big gift.

You got it!!", "Still not your problem, honestly. Hers got taken away because she proved she can't be trusted with one.
