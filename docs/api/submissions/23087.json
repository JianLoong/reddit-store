His brother would have zero reason to do this because the house has to be kept in trust for grandkids. Why would he buy out an asset like that unless he wants to live there himself? But then he doesn\u2019t really have to because his brother can\u2019t sell or force the sale. It\u2019s also going to be very difficult if not impossible for two separate family branches to jointly occupy the house. So now nobody really benefits in the near term.

Then what happens if Sam does start gambling again and can't afford property maintenance and taxes?  Alex has to pay for everything to maintain the house while Sam/Sam's kids still have a 50% right?  Do you no see how screwed up this is?  What is Alex supposed to do in this situation?  Try to sell his half of the house to Sam who may or may not have the money (or try to find a buyer who is willing to buy half a house while knowing the other person has full rights to live there and has a gambling problem? - not an investment I'd take a risk on), have lifetime arguments over who can live there, or be expected to watch his brother's finances for the rest of his life?

I understand your concerns about Sam but I\u2019m not sure what exactly you hope to achieve with this arrangement outside of conflict and heartache with your children and grandchildren.

Do you honestly think it\u2019s realistic for them to just be able to \u201csort this out\u201d amongst themselves without conflict? Who will maintain it while they are coming to an agreement? \n\nFWIW, have seen many versions of this play out in my family and can only conclude that it is pure selfishness on the part of the person dying to do something like this. If you wish to keep the house in the family, just leave it to the \u201cgood\u201d son and provide for Sam in another way. The worst example I have seen in my family is STILL playing out with a house that was left to SEVEN children in equal portions because they wanted to \u201ckeep it in the family\u201d. That was 30+ years ago. Since the kids could not agree on what to do with it, it was left languishing and in disrepair with no one wanting to take responsibility over it. Some of the children at this stage have died, which means their portions have passed on to their children, who also cannot agree on what to do with the place. It\u2019s a legal nightmare with 30+ people involved. \n\nIn my own immediate family, I\u2019ve got a mother and a MIL who wish to leave homes \u201cin the family\u201d with myself and my husband as the main ones who might be able to actually swing having them. In my mom\u2019s case, she\u2019s wanting to leave it 50/50 with me and my sister. \n\nProblem is, neither one has actually asked if this is what we want. My mom\u2019s house, as nice as it is, would be a burden for me to assume responsibility over. I\u2019d be the one having to do ALL the work and my sister wouldn\u2019t do any of it. It\u2019s honestly a huge headache and not one I want to deal with because this house is in another COUNTRY, has not been maintained, and does not have a clean title. All of the sentimental value in the world cannot make up for the time, effort, and money I\u2019d have to spend for a home that I could not under any circumstances, live in as a primary residence. Period.", "I\u2019m not going to call you an asshole, but rather give you some insight into an addicts mind.\n\nI used Xanax as a coping mechanism for my trauma of being sexually abused as a teenager. I abused the drug in order to forget about events and to \u201cnumb\u201d my emotions. Was my addiction valid due to my trauma? Absolutely not, but it doesn\u2019t change that it was my reasoning. \n\nI finally opened up to my family about my abuser and got a reaction I didn\u2019t expect. Half of my family hated me for it, and the other half was supportive and wanted me to get treatment. I ended up in a rehabilitation center and joined Alcoholics Anonymous. \n\nDuring my time there I came to the realization that I have to accept the past and also accept that I can\u2019t change the past. The only thing I can change is how I act in the present. The same is also true for how others perceive me for my past actions, I can\u2019t change what people think about me but I can accept it.\n\nWith that acceptance I no longer worry about what others think of me and my path to recovery. If they don\u2019t believe me, fine. Don\u2019t believe me or have faith in me, but at the same time while it\u2019s their right to believe whatever they want, I also have to right to keep that negativity away from me. What good is my recovery if people just hold me down for what I used to do and hold onto the idea that I can\u2019t change? That\u2019s destructive for my personality within itself.\n\nSo what I\u2019m getting at here is you have every right to feel how you want about your child, but if you have given up on believing in him and no longer trust him, then your child also has the right to remain distant in his path to recovery. \n\nIf you want him to be better, then you have to accept that someone on their path to become better doesn\u2019t need the constant reminder of their past actions. Because I can assure you if he truly does want to be better, he\u2019s beating himself up everyday. Every second.

However, I added some stipulations for Sam.\n\nIf they're already set to be 50/50 owners who would need the other to agree in order to sell the property, adding extra stipulations is dumb.  Sam already wouldn't be able to sell without Alex.  Alex already wouldn't be able to sell without Sam.

Once you pass, it isn't your house to decide on anymore - You aren't paying the taxes.  You aren't paying homeowners insurance.  Or maintenance and upkeep, or utilities, or anything else on the property.  And given it's been in the family for three generations, it's not unreasonable to think that there are updates, repairs, etc that *will need paid for*.  You're setting up a future of conflicts, arguments, and expenses for your kids because of what *you* want, disregarding what they want and any expenses or hardships it may impose to get your way.\n\n>I wrote this for Sam, so the house will go straight to my grandchildren after Sam.\n\nAgain, selfish.  But from a practicality standpoint, what happens if Alex is still alive after Sam passes?  Now he owns a property jointly with your grandkids who may or may not want to keep the house and live in it?  For that matter, what happens if Sam doesn't want to live in?  Or neither of them?  Or, for that matter, both of them?  What about the grandkids who inherit joint ownership of an old house that they now need to pay maintenance, upkeep, etc on?  Like... it's not as though they can just do nothing with the house, pay no costs for anything, and have it stay pristine just because Granny's Ghost wanted it to stay in the family.\n\n>Sam will only be able to live (not sell) and use the house and after he passes it will go straight to his children.\n\nSam already can't sell the house because he isn't the sole owner.  Again, a lawyer should have made this clear to you.  He can't supercede the other owner just because he wants to, whether you think he would use the proceeds to gamble or not.\n\n>Alex doesn't have these restrictions, but technically **woudn't be able to sell either as he doesn't have Sam's permission.**\n\n*So you do understand that because there's a joint owner, they both need to agree to sell it*.\n\n>Alex's portion is willed to straight to him though.\n\nWhich, honestly, sounds like favoritism.  You put a pointless restriction on one son but not the other, strictly so you could shame him for having an addiction he's seeking help for.\n\n>I hosted dinner at mine, inviting Sam and his family and Alex and showed them my will. Sam got very upset when I explained my will and said I don't trust him over something that was ages ago and asked I favour Alex\n\nHe's right to be upset and ask why you're favoring his brother.  You're adding a needless stipulation to him in particular because of a) Your own selfish desires about what happens to the home after you've passed, b) Out of your own need to show shame/displeasure with something from his past that he's receiving help for, and c) Possibly because your lawyer just isn't very good.\n\n>He is not talking to me.\n\nYou just made it clear to him, with documentation, that you favor his brother over him.  I wouldn't talk to you, either.\n\n>I am not sure if I am in the right here and I just want Sam to talk to me.\n\nTry rewriting the will and talking to *both* of your children about what *they* want, instead of focusing on what *you want them to do*.

You didn't favor Alex. He didn't gamble or make mistakes with his money as Sam did. Nah, you checked and double-checked with your lawyer and came to this decision, and Sam can't do anything because it's your house, your money, your will, and your choice. I hope your DIL is fine with this, considering she almost left Sam due to his ways.", "To your question, you're nta - Sam has had gambling issues and the worry that he may unwisely waste the inheritance.

Alex won't be able to do anything with the house until his brother *dies*. Inheriting a house that his brother is only allowed to live in until he dies (in which his children gain half the proceeds) does Alex no good: Alex could easily be, say, 75+ until the house is sold (assuming he outlives Sam), and in that whole time, he may be unable to live in it unless both brothers move in their respective families. In that whole time, Alex will be saddled with making sure the house is maintained.\n\nUnless this is a ***massive*** house and both families are OK with that sacrifice, that doesn't really do anyone any good, unless Sam and Alex decide to make it a rental and collect passive income from it. There really should have been a deeper discussion to your children about their life plans.\n\nUnless Alex has interest in owning and living in that house, you should probably have it set that Alex will own 50% of the house, with the other 50% put into a trust. This way, if Alex wants to sell he can, otherwise, Alex could buy out Sam + Sam's kids interests in the house if he wishes to own it in full. \n\nThe trust can have stipulations on how and when the money can be removed.

How many years or how much does he have to do until he can be \"trusted \". Or any addict for that matter. Is anyone's past supposed to affect how they are treated their whole life? No matter how much they have progressed or how long its been? Yes, if he was in active addiction or in treatment, or it hasn't been long. But from the sound of it, it seems he has turned his life around and is still being treated as untrustworthy. Addicts who aren't in active addiction are no different than anyone else. That stigma of they're all liars, cheaters, and stealers and always will be is outdated and harmful. He isn't saying she is the \"bad guy,\" but does he have no right to be upset for being treated so differently. Maybe she is being paranoid or overly cautious when it isn't needed. But let's treat the person who struggled with addiction more like the other or black sheep. I'm sure that's great for him and this whole situation. If there is more info about where he is at and how long it's been. What he does to keep himself in a good place, then maybe there could be more nuance here. Addiction is a medical illness.

I\u2019ve been working on it :)", "40+ years as an estate administration atty.\n\nMy comments are based on US laws (OP is I think US based because of her description of the trust) and of course things vary by jurisdiction.\n\nThe will may stand up in Court (although it sounds like the trust was created to avoid probate so it would never even be seen by the Court unless there was a dispute); it is the testamentary trust created under the will that is the problem.\n\nStates that follow the UPC (18 states), California, and states that follow the same model as CA (another 3 states) have procedures to allow the heirs to get out from under burdensome estate plans; and most other jurisdictions have something similar. (Louisiana is its own animal). If all the beneficiaries of an irrevocable trust agree, and it is otherwise reasonable to do so, the trust terms may be changed (for instance, to allow the house to be sold). But it involves Court costs and fees (about $15-20,000 in CA to do this properly and assuming everybody is 100% in agreement).\n\nAnd OP's plan is burdensome on the heirs as it will require cooperation between bros using the property + ongoing accountings to the minor beneficiaries etc. that can become quite expensive. While also preventing either brother from having full use of the property or selling it even if that is what they both want.\n\nWhat she planned is doable (and avoids probate) so long as both brothers are in agreement.

Alex gets 50% regardless.  Sam only gets a life estate with remainder (50%) to his kids.  Both lines get equal portions but in different ways.
