And you should be okay with that. Since you're not, it solidifies our reasoning to give it to them.", "NTA at all! You are protecting you DIL and grand kids", "Everyone saying YTA must not have any experience with a gambler in the family. Like any addict they will lie. They hold nothing sacred, most certainly not a valuable and nostalgic asset such as a family home. That property would get liquidated in a heartbeat and vaporized at the casino. Your son's anger likely is proof that you made the right call. He should be grateful to be getting half an asset that can benefit his children but he's not, probably because he can't transfer it to cash and flush it down the toilet.

Do Sam and Alex want to live together until they die?\n\nETA: is Sam going to be responsible for half the property taxes on a property he doesn\u2019t technically own and can\u2019t sell if they get too expensive?

Not a 'being up at dinner'. \n\nAlso, so if Alex also has a couple kids, and maybe Sam has one more, at some point 4 or 5 people are all going to 'own' the house. And it'll only get worse as generations go on. Its a pain in the ass and i know this bc a friend owns family land.......with 8 other cousins.  Doing any maintenance is such a big deal!", "NTA but your house situation sounds like a freaking nightmare. What if Alex wants to live in the house?

I can appreciate wanting to keep the house in the family and wanting Sam and his children to get something from the estate but you're engineering a conflict by not giving the house to one of them. It's untenable for two families to co-occupy a home under most circumstances. If you can't trust Sam, give the house to Alex and get Sam some other compensation from the estate. The only way to get a fair split on the property is by selling it and dividing the cash.", "YTA. You're setting your sons for conflict.

Not a right. I understand the hurt, but I don\u2019t understand the entitlement.", "YTA.\n\nFirst, my condolences on both the loss of your husband last year and your diagnosis. I'm sure it has been a difficult time and, unfortunately, this decision isn't going to make it any easier.\n\nAs a parent myself, I know one immutable fact - if you treat your kids differently where the kids can see, they WILL take it as favoritism. Period. It doesn't matter how old they are or how logical the decision is, someone will always take offense. And you didn't just do this without thinking, you intentionally did it with forethought. No wonder Sam is upset.

That forces people to be joint owners that may have very different ideas on how to maintain a property. And what happens if Alex does decide to sell his half and NOT to Sam?

You will be making your family self destruct.", "NTA - you\u2019re doing the right things momma bear! Gambling addiction is very real and that house is important.

You can even state that the house can only be sold at xx% under market value (due to not needing a realtor) if selling to family and that intention to sell must be communicated with enough notice that a family member could get their finances in order to buy.\n\nYour gambling son cannot be protected from himself and his own bad decisions, no matter what you do. And you are setting up your other son to be dragged down by him.", "NTA for limiting Sam\u2019s access to the estate but have you thought about how they will realistically live in/maintain the house?  Yea it\u2019s nice to keep it in the family but how will Alex benefit from it if Sam can\u2019t sell it? So Alex will need to wait until Sam\u2019s children grow up to utilize the funds from the house? Or do you expect two families to live in the house together? Is it some sort of mansion/castle? Or is their only option to rent it out until Sam\u2019s children can make financial decisions? It\u2019s a recipe for disaster tbh.", "YTA - to encumber your sons with an asset (the house) that they have to maintain and insure and pay taxes on and can't get out from under it until Sam dies.  With two sons - what if they both don't want to live together, how do they decide who gets to live there and does the other son get \"rent\"?    Maybe neither wants to live there, who has the burden of being a landlord and property maintainer?  What if the they both want to move far away, they are stuck with a house that they have to throw money at and can't sell?  You want the house to stay in your family, but as an asset, not as a burden.  Put Sam's portion of his inheritance in a trust so he can't gamble it away.  Allow the boys to do what they want with the house.", "YTA. Yes you can carve up the family home like this, but how is this actually going to work? They both have the right to live there, but neither can sell? You\u2019re setting up a disaster.", "YTA - why didn\u2019t you just set up the trust for BOTH sons instead of only one? You already said that it was effectively the same thing, since it couldn\u2019t be sold without Sam\u2019s permission. Why was it important that Sam know you didn\u2019t trust him?", "YTA for not setting it the same way for both sons. Neither of them can sell the house, so why not put the same stipulations on both sons?", "YTA. I don't get people wanting XY to stay in the family. Why do you care after you're dead?

Don't call a damn party at your house to tell them that. \n\nYou came in like a wrecking ball with your news.
