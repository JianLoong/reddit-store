I\u2019m a PT and he is in residency for internal med which will last 4-6 years depending on what he wants to specialize in. We met in college while he was in med school and I was in the PT graduate program. He is in year 1 and his salary is barely enough to cover rent. Rent is $2600 for both of us and $1300 a person not including utilities. It\u2019s expensive because we have to live near the hospital as he has call sometimes. With food, car insurance, gas etc he is just making it. And with interest rates on his student loans he doesn\u2019t want to take more out to live. I make over double what he does and he wants me to cover most of the rent. But I feel hesitant because he said he doesn\u2019t want to get married until he is done residency and becomes a fully qualified doctor. We have been dating for 3 years and living together for over 2 and I feel like waiting 3-5 more years to get married is way too long. He says it\u2019s because he can\u2019t marry me with so many loans. But I have a lot of loans as well. Not as much as him but it\u2019s not like we both don\u2019t have a lot of student loan debt. \n\nI also just started making this much money and have been putting in lump sums into paying off my student loans. I just feel like if he is going to wait so long he probably isn\u2019t sure about this relationship and I don\u2019t want to pay into a relationship he doesn\u2019t feel confident enough about to go further in. I told him I don\u2019t want to pay more towards rent until marriage and he is accusing me of pushing him before he is ready. I have dropped the topic of marriage but he keeps pushing for me to cover more rent, saying if I\u2019m not willing then how can he consider the relationship serious enough for marriage. We also want kids and I don\u2019t want them out of wedlock so in 3-5 years I\u2019m going to be 30-32 before we even try for a child. I\u2019m not saying we will have one now, it\u2019s too early but I\u2019m not sure this timeline works for me especially since we have been dating for 3 years already. But he thinks since I make more I should cover more even if we weren\u2019t serious enough for marriage.

Both can be remedied with one fell swoop. \n\nOr, you could play hardball and let him know that you'd consider the rent payments to be a loan, repayment of which will be negated upon marriage, but without a proposal, it'll be due the moment he becomes a fully qualified doctor. \n\nSide note \"can't marry you because I have loans\" is a bizarre notion - what, will those loans disappear once he becomes a fully licensed doctor? No. He'll have them for years and years.", "NTA. I'm sure you're aware of all the \"I put you through med school and you dump me after you're making the big bucks\" stories. I'm not saying bf is one of those, but you'd be silly to ignore the phenomenon. What would he be doing if he were single, ask a roommate to pay more? No. He would only ask a girlfriend. He obviously needs you to subsidize his life, but won't give you any security in return. You need to find out what is different, in his mind, about being married as a full doctor, as opposed to being married as a resident. Given your situation, he really should know by now if he wants to marry you. If not, what does he hope to discover, in order to be \"ready.\" If I had to bet, I'd say he is so busy, and so completely absorbed in his arduous work, that this decision isn't his top priority, and he thinks (correctly) that he can put it off, and put it off...which would be fine, but he just can't have the benefits of commitment, until he chooses. This is not \"putting pressure on him\" it's just saying you won't unilaterally up the ante.", "NTA\n\nThere are many stories about people who helped their partners during studies/residency/internship, just to be abandoned when partner no longer needed their help. Actually, this is a popular scheme. You have the right to protect youself.", "The number of people who actually get married after all their premed studies is very low. If you aren't wanting to wait another 5 years to get married then find another person.", "NTA\n\nHis job requires living in the high rent area so he is close enough for call, but he wants you to subsidize his convenience yet does not want to talk about marriage after being together this long?  If money is the problem, most folks look for something cheaper, but apparently only he gets to be cheap.", "NTA - he is giving you the run around.  What is the actual story here?  He can't marry you yet because he doesn't have enough money, or he can't marry you yet because you won't pay his bills for him, so he can't trust that you are serious?  I really don't like these mind games, and it doesn't make him seem like a super honest or straight forward person.  \n\nIf he doesn't see marriage for another 3-5 years, then it's an awfully big ask for you to fund him for that period, especially because you have no guarantee that he will ever be ready for marriage with you.  He's going to be a doctor, so he will make enough money to pay back those loans, and he's really just being greedy.  He should either marry you or take out loans.  Why give him the financial benefits of marriage without him having to make any commitment to you?", "He is playing you with no intention of marriage. If he is not willing to commit, finances should be equal and separate.", "NAH.\nYou\u2019re not on the same page yet, and you both have valid perspectives. Only you can decide if you\u2019re okay with compromising or not\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, my now husband and I were together 7 years before marriage (living together for 3), together almost 11 years before having our first baby this summer (I\u2019m 33, he\u2019s 34). He wanted to finish graduate school and be on better footing financially, and we both wanted better footing overall before children. Sure we got some comments but we knew we loved each other and had the rest of our lives for all that stuff, so we were in no rush. We\u2019re both VERY glad we waited!", "Mmmm I\u2019m struggling. Why does marriage have to mean commitment? Do you have any idea how many posts real or not are here on a daily basis of marriages going bad? Cheating? And a host of other issues? Marriage is not an end goal and it shouldn\u2019t be the defining factor of whether or not you actually love and care for someone. \n\nEither you want to be with him or you don\u2019t. Either you want to help support him or you don\u2019t. \nEither you care enough to help with his struggle or you don\u2019t. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s using you as a cash cow but asking for help with the rent in a place you both share because he can\u2019t make his ends meet and you know can\u2019t get a second job to do it. \n\nIf you\u2019re covering 50/50, that isn\u2019t a fair split already if he\u2019s making less than half of what you do . I\u2019m strongly of the mind that if you make 30% more than him, you should cover more of the expenses, so bump it to 70/30 where you cover 70% of the shared expenses. Note SHARED. So if your shared expenses is 3k you cover 70% of that. Numbers are examples obviously. Just something to consider. \n\nBUT. And there is one. \nHe needs to be realistic in his own expenses and look at what he can cut out or down on. Or maybe y\u2019all need to look into a smaller cheaper apt that makes it easier for him to cover. Especially if his monthly income isn\u2019t enough to cover the rent. \n\nWhen living with someone (partner) always ask, \u201ccan I afford all the bills by myself?\u201d If the answer is no or barely then don\u2019t do it. \n\nOh judgement is E S H or maybe NAH to be honest.", "NTA. Do a quick google on the number of men who leave the person who supported/sponsored their life during med school/residency that ditch them once they\u2019re better off financially.

That is not your husband and may never be.", "NTA your boyfriend sounds like the type that'll dump you as soon as he finishes  med school, it's a huge thing, you're the starter girlfriend", "No assholes here.  This is just a different opinion on what is fair.  Some people divide evenly.  She could divide proportionally to salary, since would even says 50\\50 on cost of a reasonable apartment and he pays the upcharge for the location he wanted.  Neither of you are assholes and neither of you are wrong.  You do need to get in the same page with money though.  Both now and in the future.  What makes him uncomfortable with marriage? Something a prenup could fix?", "You are wise to look out for your financial future.  No body else is going to do that.", "NAH\n\nLet's be honest. You want to pay down your debt. He wants you to pay so he doesn't go into more debt.\n\nIf you marry this won't matter (assuming you share income and debt). He will have x more debt and you will have x less debt.\n\nIf you don't marry you think the money will be better in your hands and he thinks it will be better in his hands.\n\nThat's all that's going on here.\n\nQuestioning what's fair, well in a serious relationship I would generally go for % of income rather than 50/50 but that's not a big deal.

I just saw a thread where a guy got roasted and dragged for not wanting to pay more than 50/50 because he made more money and GF wanted to save her money. And here we have a role reversal where the guy is STILL the bad guy for being in the opposite role and wanting the GF to cover more. \n\nSeems there is a bias on the threads here, is all I'm saying. Guy makes more, he should pay more than half. Guy makes less, he should still pay half.", "NTA\n\nFamily helps each other out and don't worry so much about the percentages. I feel it is different if you're just dating or even living together. He doesn't want the commitment of a marriage and you don't want to deplete your savings or potential savings to support someone who isn't your husband.  It all makes perfect sense.", "NTA. You need a different bf or have a serious talk.  It sounds like he wants you to support him while he is in med school.  If he can\u2019t put a ring on it then he can\u2019t expect full financial support from you.  Always keep some separate money and have a joint account for shared expenses.  Money is not worth fighting over.  If you discover he can\u2019t manage money then it is time for another talk.", "Nah but it sounds like some counseling, at least individual counseling for you, may be a good idea. He has good reasons (residency) for not getting married yet. You have good reasons (biological clock) for wanting to get married sooner. Your long term plans may simply not be compatible. You\u2019re being smart not to get too involved financially without a commitment. I think you need to work out what it is you want because you\u2019re currently in limbo, which induces a lot of anxiety if it was me.", "NTA. I would not take anyone seriously who says they will marry me in 4 to 6 years. Thanks to you, he is already  in a very comfortable position with low rent in a convenient location. If you pay the full rent, he will finish school in 5 years and suddenly decide that the relationship isn't working. Let him pay his rightful share, if he needs extra time to decide. For now, he is just a roommate.", "NTA \n\n\"I have dropped the topic of marriage but he keeps pushing for me to cover more rent, saying if I\u2019m not willing then how can he consider the relationship serious enough for marriage.\"\n\nYou need to tell him to shit or get off the pot.

That makes zero sense.\n\n\nJust say you\u2019re not ready to pay more towards bills. He wants to benefit from a joint income but not get married right now.

Really, it would be best if you werent even living together at this point, otherwise why does he need to marry at all.", "NTA. He has already been with you three years. Most people know by then if you want to marry someone. He probably knows he doesn\u2019t want to marry you but he wants to reap the benefits of having a spouse. If you were married then I would say combine the incomes and pay everything together but right now you are basically roommates that hook up. You have no protection if he decides to dump you when done with school. You need to think about your own future and pay down your own debts.

They broke up when my sister was 36 - and she gave up her dream of having a family.\n\nWaiting until your in your early thirties puts your dream of building a family in serious risk. If having kids is truly a dealbreaker, an ultimatum is reasonable.  Just know it could end the relationship or cause lingering resentment if he\u2019s not really not sure you\u2019re the one.", "NTA - how many times do we see stories of the woman who basically bankrolled the med student through the long years of training only to be left high and dry the minute they fully qualified and were making mega bucks. If you are not good enough to be fully committed to now then your money is not good enough to be used to subsidise him In his training. You need that money for yourself - but i would bet he won\u2019t actually commit to marry and make a family with you so if that's your ultimate goal you need to think carefully about whether this is the forever relationship partner of choice.", "NTA\n\nHe's asking you to invest in him while he has no skin in the game. You are smart to see it for what it is. He is not going to have any less loans in 5 years and he will probably still have shit ton of loans in 10 years. You are already investing in him as you had to select a place close to his work which is more expensive than if you lived somewhere else. \n\n\n\nThere is no guarantee he will marry you in 3, 5 or 10 years but if you start paying more for rent now that is for sure going to result in you taking much longer to pay off your student loans and having much less in your retirement account while he gets discounted rent. \n\n\nHe is looking for wife benefits from his gf. It's a no from me", "ESH. If you are committed to each other and live under the same roof, it makes sense that you cover more rent. But him wanting to wait to get married until after school is also weird if you know you want to be married. Eventually your finances will be one unit anyway unless you intend to keep it separate. \n\nAlso marriage as an ultimatum is not out of the question. He should be prioritizing you over a career.", "NTA and pretty smart on your part, why should you pay more when it could be you just paying for him to live till he completes hes stuff and then he can bin you off once hes got that better wage.", "Lol love reading the comments on this one compared to a guy in the same situation in a similar recent post", "YTA you won\u2019t even pay a little bit more in rent why on earth would you think he would want to marry someone like that without being able to fully support himself?", "NTA, unless you are married with a claim on his future income, there is no reason for you to subsidize his expenses. It\u2019s honestly a big red flag that he expects you to pay more than he does at this stage.", "NTA\n\nIt's not about who pays more.  It's about who is being entitled and making demands.  To be fair, he may be thinking that he'll be making a lot more once he's done with training and he wants to be sure that you're not just in it for the money, but if he's serious about marriage then why does he keep making excuses?\n\nMarriage counselling might be good here.  You're talking past each other.", "3-5 years in the grand scheme of spending 50+ years together is nothing.

Really, the key sentence is him saying he can\u2019t marry you with so many loans.  What\u2026does he think that problem is going to magically disappear as soon as he finishes his residency?  So, a few more years after he finishes his residency.  Not 3-5 years\u2026more like 6-10 years.  \n\nReally, the issues he\u2019s bringing up sound more like excuses to not commit.  Which would make me very cautious about compromising my financial stability to help fund the education of someone who won\u2019t commit.  It\u2019s not that you\u2019re unwilling to pay more of the rent.  You just need the assurance that you are both in it for the long haul.

My best friend dated his Gf for 9 years from grade 9 before they got married? He wanted to be a journeyman and have a house before they had kids and she figured married meant kids.

Almost like getting married before you\u2019re financially stable working a steady job and living in a child friendly home is some peoples way of caring for their family and making sure it lasts.

Nothing he does is selfish because he's a man, period.  Gotcha.\n\nAlso, she's fine not marrying him right now; she just won't pay his rent.  He's the one crying foul and holding money over her as a precursor to even considering marriage.  Your hypocrisy is hilarious.", "\"Making it so he can afford rent when he\u2019s trying to become a dr to support their family...\"\n\nAnd that is the problem.

She becomes less financially stable by paying less on her loans, he gets surer financial footing and support. And she gets....??? No commitment that he'll stick with her after she's done subsidizing him or that he's serious about the relationship. She wants an assurance, he wants money. \n\nYou know a geriatric pregnancy is 35 years and up right?
