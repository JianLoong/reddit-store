{"id": 33448, "submission_id": "18n1ip4", "title": "WIBTA if I give gifts on Christmas after it\u2019s been stated that there will be no gift giving among the adults?", "selftext": "Normally I (28F) would be all for respecting other people\u2019s wishes. However, this year we\u2019re hosting Christmas in our home and to ensure I\u2019d prepare everything on time I purchased all gifts late November early December. Nine days before Christmas my MIL (mid 60s) told my husband that SIL and her decided there wouldn\u2019t be gifts, except for the children, because they don\u2019t have time to do shopping.\n\nI\u2019m not in need of any gifts in return, but the idea that my thoughtful gifts I spent weeks figuring out would go to waste feels unfair. My friend suggested I should just save the gifts and hand it out on everyone\u2019s birthdays, but they\u2019re all a ways away and I don\u2019t know where exactly I\u2019d store everything. \n\nI\u2019m contemplating just giving the gifts and explaining the situation (that I purchased them way before I was informed of the no gift policy) but I\u2019ve been informed that it would be rude and make the other people feel bad.\n\nEdit: to clarify a few things.\n\nWhy don\u2019t we tell MIL? \n\nHusband told her I was not on the phone. Husband said she was neither upset nor happy, she stated she will not have time to get gifts. Husband said there was absolutely no expectations of gifts in return.\n\nI was personally only informed through my husband. \n\nThe reason I haven\u2019t spoken to SIL/BIL about this is because they\u2019re on vacation and can\u2019t be reached.\n\nWas it an agreement?\n\nMIL stated the gifting policy and said she already told SIL. The grandmas were never informed by her. SIL hasn\u2019t spoken to my husband or I about this.\n\nWhat does my husband think?\n\nHe believes we should absolutely give the gifts and think his mother is ridiculous. I\u2019m much more concerned about her opinion and offending his family.\n\nWhy did I buy the gifts so early?\n\nEvery Christmas for the past 10 years there have been gifts. The no gift policy has never been brought up previously. In fact MIL is the type to come over and every time she sees something she likes in our home she mentions she\u2019d love to get it as a gift. She has never had an issue accepting gifts. \n\n\u201cBlaming\u201d the gifts on Santa?\n\nWe live in a part of the world where baby Jesus and the angels bring gifts. It wouldn\u2019t really make sense for us. \n\nReturning/storing the gifts?\n\nWe got a vacation for my in-laws, we\u2019ve done this every year for the past 5 years. BIL\u2019s gift is a collectors item it was purchased from an individual, I don\u2019t think I can return it. SIL\u2019s gift I got on sale so I can\u2019t return it. The grandmas are getting larger items, technically could be returned. I don\u2019t understand fully why I can\u2019t give my own grandmother a gift\u2026? I could give it to her a different day I suppose, but it is a Christmas gift. \n\nSpecifically storing it grandmas gifts are currently at my husband\u2019s office. We could store SIL and BIL\u2019s gifts until their birthdays next Fall if we absolutely had to.\n\n", "created_utc": 1703096877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18n1ip4/wibta_if_i_give_gifts_on_christmas_after_its_been/", "score": 357, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Tell them NOW \u201cHey, I know you guys decided you didn\u2019t want to deal gifts for adults this year, but with hosting I tried to get ahead of the game and already had my shopping done before I knew about your decision. I don\u2019t want the gifts to go to waste, so I\u2019ll have them here for you; but I don\u2019t expect anything in return and understand you won\u2019t have anything for me.\u201d I think it would be better if they knew coming in that you will have something for them rather than being blindsided and feel put on the spot.", "Ugh 9 days before an event at YOUR house, someone just decides that because they were lazy and didn't bother, no one should get to give gifts. That's asinine. NTA. Your house, your choice whether or not to give gifts. BUT I would reach out to everyone else and let them know so they don't feel like the AH for showing up with no gifts. I would be SUPER surprised if you're the only one going, \"What do I do with the gifts I bought now?\"", "Well you can\u2019t do anything about it if SANTA leaves gifts for everybody.", "NTA.\n\n9 days is suuuuper short notice for a decision like this. Especially if it's different from previous years. And it seems weird it was \"stated\", rather than you being involved in the decision, especially as SIL was.\n\nI do like the idea of holding the gifts back for birthdays, but I get it may not be practical.\n\nJust explain that you normally do your shopping early, and that you're excited about the gifts you picked out. You can make it clear that you will gladly follow their plan in future years. If they still make a fuss, say that while you're unable to store the gifts, you're happy for people to consider them early birthday presents.", "NTA - Honestly 9 days before Christmas seems like an unreasonable amount of time to inform everyone \"no gift giving\". Some people start shopping on Black Friday. I had all my shopping done in November. \n\nJust call them elaborately thought-out party favors and hand them to people as they walk out the door.", "NTA - Why do 2 people get to decide what everyone else does?  It'd be different if you had all agreed beforehand, but 2 people don't just get to decide nobody's exchanging gifts.  Just tell them you've already bought gifts and will be giving them out but you don't need anything in return.  What they do with that is up to them.", "YWNBTAH \n\nA) You did not agree to this no gift giving \nB) You already purchased the gifts, it's not like you saw the message with no gifts and then went out and purchased them\n\nHowever, please give them a heads up and explain the situation. \nDear family I know you have agreed on no gifts for the adults, but unfortunately I already purchased yours before this information was given to me. I really looked forward to giving them to you guys. Please know that I do not expect any kind of reciprocation.", "NTA You can do whatever you want with your money and efforts.\n\nMy family does this too. One or two people unilaterally decide for everyone that there will be no gift giving. I don't care what they want, I will do what I want.  I usually get nothing but at least I bring a nice little gift for everyone.  I keep my gifts under $20. One year I sent the gifts up in a nice basket and when surveyed a week later, someone actually took all of them for themselves.", "NTA but give them a heads up that you had already done all your shopping long before they said no gifts and you would like people to have them regardless", "We have done this. Different reason, but same thing. We were hosting. We were told no presents.     \n\nNah...   As the hosting couple, WE make the rules. So we got presents for every person coming, and a few extras in case we had drop ins.  \n\nWhen everyone was there, we had the kids go into the closet and pull out the presents handing them to everyone. I mean, who will say no to a 5 year old, right? While they did that we explained that as the host we wanted to thank everyone for coming, and what better way than a gift.", "As the host, you get to define who gets gifts in your house. They are not obligated to reciprocate. \n\nNTA", "NTA  they want to change everything so they don't feel like the assholes. Someone telling you \"no gifts on Christmas\" is about as grinch as it gets, to hell with that. Just give your gifts out and forewarn them because it isn't going to stop you. The effort you took should be appreciated. Tell them to stop at a gas station and pick up some candy and keychains....whatever....anything. There's still time, so no excuse.", "Nta since she told you so late", "NTA. Giving gifts isn\u2019t about having a gift back in return. It\u2019s about how much you love and appreciate the people who you are giving gifts to. Someone earlier said send a text to the group chat and explain you\u2019d already bought them so they\u2019re not blind sided and I would agree. As long as you\u2019re clear about not having anything in return, and you\u2019d bought them before the no gift rule, I think you\u2019d be fine.", "Be honest\nSimply say that you did shopping early and you have present for all and you would like to give them and be clear you do not want anything om return.\n\nIf a grown person is offended my that then it is that persons problem.\n\nAnd honestly to give 9 days notice of this is really to late and sort off rude.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd if they feel they must give something back then they can do that after christmas. You are adults.", "I say NTA. Why do your in-laws get to decide who gets gifts and who doesn't? Give the gifts and explain the situation. Be clear that you don't expect anything in return.", "NTA. THEY decided not to do gifts and they want you to follow suit so they don\u2019t feel like losers for not getting anyone presents. Their decision did not involve your input and there\u2019s no onus on you to make the same decision. It\u2019s especially rude that they informed you of this like a blanket rule for everyone when you\u2019re the goddamn host and its just over a week away.\n\nJust say, \u201cthat\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t need to worry about buying gifts if you don\u2019t have the time, but I already did my Christmas shopping and have gifts for everyone so I\u2019m going to be giving them out on Christmas.\u201d", "NTA if you warn them ahead of time.  I personally HATE receiving gifts, and always tell people please no gifts.  A few people still feel the need to get me something, and it honestly does annoy me.  To be clear I do enjoy giving gifts but would prefer nothing in return.", "NTA at all! Gifts are not supposed to be a competition. Maybe your family needs to learn to give you the joy of giving and not Make everything transactional.", "I say NTA, but I may be biased because I lived through this exact scenario last year, except I wasn\u2019t hosting. For context, the person who stated no more gifts for adults wasn\u2019t either. \n\nI think gift giving is fun. I have a notes app that I fill throught out the year for this purpose. And buy when things go on sale. So most things are bought in advance. \n\nI don\u2019t have kids and don\u2019t plan on having any time soon. But the person with kids is the one who made the statement that \u201cthis is how it will be for coming years\u201d. No one said anything when this statement was made. It\u2019s my in-laws side so I said nothing. \n\nPeople this year are just giving gifts to adults \u201cin private\u201d. Instead of just doing it like usual. Which i find very silly. \n\nOn my side when someone is in a tough spot and can\u2019t buy gifts, we just say it. \u201cHey can only do kids gifts this year\u201d or whatever the constraint is. But that doesn\u2019t refrain someone from offering a gift to the person who can\u2019t give. \n\nWhy would it? Buy what you can afford and to whom you want to give. I feel like it has nothing to do with receiving.\n\nEdit: Your house your rules! Let there be gifts!!", "She \"won't have time\" to print an Amazon voucher?\n\nGive the gifts and expect her to do better. I also sort out all the gifts in November. What kind of nonsense is this?", "No, YWNBTA, but only if you provide the explanation. Even a prior group text would work.\n\n\"Hey everyone, we're afraid it's too late for the no gifts rule for us - we definitely don't need gifts in return, but we're so happy with what we've chosen that we would be heartbroken if we couldn't give them to you. So we're exempting ourselves! And we can't wait to see you all. xoxo\"", "Give the gifts! Make a little speech before: picking out gifts for our loved ones makes me happy. We need nothing in return. Sharing Christmas with you is our greatest gift.", "INFO - Have you spoken to them about this?", "NTA - your mother and sister in law decided this 9 days before Christmas without consulting other adults, that\u2019s rude. They should have asked if everyone was okay with that first and provided more notice. Since you brought the gifts before this decision was made for you, that would not make you an AH if you decide to give them out", "NTA\n\nYou're hosting Christmas so I think different rules apply.", "INFO: How many people are going? Did everyone agree or was it just your MIL letting you know?", "NTA - I would do exactly as you would like to, and I have - I gift shop over the whole year because I really dislike shopping in November and December, so I save things and gift them either at birthdays or during the holidays. I don't expect gifts back and that works really well for me,", "NTA. You're the host. They didn't consult you. Not that not bringing gifts is an issue, things happen and maybe it's time but it could be finances. I've been there. But you're hosting. Just tell them as the host you wanted to gift everyone and you don't need or expect anything in return.", "Christmas is about the giving part not receiving. If you want to give a gift that's fine. \nI don't see what the big deal is. \nWe have said no gifts this year on my husband's side but I'm still going to give everyone something small. \nGift giving is one of the love languages.", "MIL and SIL dictating how you're going to behave at your party? SMH. Just be sure no one feels left out.", "NTA. The only people who are AH\u2019s here are the two who thought they had the power to mandate this for others. Give the gifts as intended and fail to engage otherwise in this nonsense.", "NTA\n\nYou are the host - you decide.  Why would MIL decide that? I MIL gets mad, just say, oh, you said you aren't giving gifts, we are cool with that - we just want to give gifts so we will.\n\n I'm beginning to think my family was super strange growing up bc we didn't have so many of these Reddit problems.", "NTA ..\n\nJust give the gifts with the explanation that they were already bought before this 11th hour \"mandate.\"\n\nI have to say though, that I've never quite understood adult relatives exchanging gifts with each other. You'll see people complaining about not Knowing what to get their sister-in-law, or their third cousin twice removed.  WTF? That stuff's for kids. Of course spouses should get each other gifts, but any others? Nah.", "Nta.  I think it\u2019s rude of them to expect no one else plans ahead for the holidays.  My boyfriend\u2019s family has said that to us before and we just responded with, \u201coops, should\u2019ve warned us about that in august!\u201d  (I always travel in august/September and try to find some cool stuff then.). \n\nWe explained that we very much enjoy giving presents, and it is not at all about a desire to receive things in return.  \n\nPrivately I feel that the labor of time and consideration is a big part of the gift giving tradition and they already told us they hadn\u2019t bothered with that, so buying random crap later wouldn\u2019t do any good.  \n\nI also, however, refused to have any part in buying them gifts for 2 years after that incident.  I\u2019ve started again because I really do enjoy it, but I still have reservations about it.", "NAH, even with the edits I'm not sure what the problem is. The MIL isn't getting anyone gifts, fine, that doesn't have anything to do with you. It doesn't seem like she's particularly concerned that you are giving gifts to other family members, everyone's just trying too hard to avoid the possibility of making her feel like she's \"the cheap one\" or something. Everyone is free to say \"that's okay mom, we totally understand\" and just give gifts as usual.", "NTA It's super last minute to decide no gifts. Just make sure to let them know. \n\nYour husband does need to communicate directly with his sister instead of playing telephone through their mom though. It sounds like MIL is one of those people who thinks she's in charge of the whole family and can speak for everyone, but you're all adults so he should just call SIL and have an adult conversation about it.", "I get having no-gift events or parties, but to ban gifting is rude, IMO. If they don't want to give gifts, that's fine, but why are they trying to suck the joy of giving amongst others? I say give the gifts, but maybe not at the event itself. Perhaps out of earshot of the IL who banned the gift giving. Let the others know so they won't feel blindsided.", "NTA - let em know they\u2019re getting gifts, give em gifts, f\u2019em if they can\u2019t appreciate that you planned in advance like a normal person. Christmas goes up in Walmart in August for chris sakes, 9 days \u2026..", "NAH, but I would not give the gifts without informing others you will do so. It is true that it can feel really crappy when you think you\u2019ve agreed to not exchange gifts and then somebody gives you one anyways. It makes you feel like an asshole who doesn\u2019t care about the other person as much as they care about you. When in reality you are just complying with the agreed upon arrangement. \n\nBUT\n\nI think you can absolutely just inform them that you don\u2019t expect any gifts and you understand the agreement but that you already purchased things for people before then and would still like to give them their gifts and do not expect anything in return. Generally people won\u2019t have an issue with it at that point, and you\u2019ve done your due diligence to not set them up to feel like a jerk.", "NTA - Having a no gifts Christmas is fine, but announcing it 9 days before Christmas is rude as hell unless there was an actual extenuating circumstance like a hospitalization or death or something. This is a classic \"you lack of preparation does not constitute an emergency on my end\". Change nothing about your plans. If MIL and FIL are empty handed that is their own problem.", "NTA because I'm sorry, dropping a \"no gifts\" ting NINE DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS is not on.\n\nThey don't have time, but most other people do and have gotten their shit together way before then.\n\nI'd simply say \"I'd already bought gifts so no point them going to waste\".\n\nIt doesn't matter if you don't get anything in return!", "NTA. I feel like most people are already finished shopping 9 days out from the event.

Everyone but them had already done their Christmas shopping, so we exchanged gifts before we went to their house. \n\nYou could just pull people aside as they leave, walk them out to their cars and give their gifts away from others. \n\nIf people want to adopt a no gifts policy, they need to announce that a month before hand.

And that your not expecting anything in return.", "OP, I upvoted the top comment, but I'll add a little more:\n\n1. Let your husband send the message to HIS family.\n2. Just as MIL informed everyone she did not have time to go gift shopping, your husband can inform everyone that (the collective you-he) you had already got gifts and will be giving them (with no expectation of a gift in return).\n3. When adult family members are getting together, no one person (even the matriarch) gets to unilaterally tell everyone else 'the rules' - and especially not at the last minute.\n4. It's perfectly normal for people to try to buy gifts ahead of the Christmas rush; there's nothing to apologize for.\n5. Don't you think the thoughtfulness of the gifts you chose will warm the hearts of your in-laws? Don't lose that because you feel you should contort your plans to fit into a last-minute word from MIL. Give the gifts simply and without guilt.", "NTA.  I would just let everyone know that you were informed far too late of the no gift policy and had already selected gifts for everyone, but you are absolutely fine with the gift of their company and nothing else this year.", "If you\u2019re going to, tell them now.

That doesn't mean you have to follow them. Give everyone gifts anyhow. \n\nWhen I visit my aunt for Christmas usually I'll give her, my uncle, and their dog a small gift each. All 3 gifts can be carried in 1 arm, but when I leave I need 2 trips cause of all the gifts I received.

I\u2019m not doing that. \n\nI would just inform them before hand, and explain this was bought a while before and unfortunately the return by date has expired. You don\u2019t expect gifts in return. If they would like their gifts you will hand them out. If not, you can keep them and try to resell. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but as others have mentioned, it just sounds like they didn\u2019t realize they didnt have enough time, or just don\u2019t want to spend money. Nobody should fault you for doing shopping in advance. Especially knowing you were hosting and wanted to do it before all the minute details were of forefront in the mind.", "NTA. It is so presumptuous of MIL and SIL to drop this on the family because SHE screwed up.

And as she hosts all family dinners and holidays I defer to her.

These things have to be decided well in advance, not days before. There are go getters and last minutes shoppers, but families need to be on the same page for holidays/traditions in advanced.

Unfortunately, around goft giving holidays giving people gifts they weren't expecting makes them feel a lot of things like guilt, obligation, and awkwardness.

I tend to ask friendly acquaintances if they'll mind getting a small gift from me.\n\nPut their gifts in bags. If they show up with something for you, give them their gifts. If they don't, take them the gift sometime after the holidays and present it with a very casual, \"Oh here's something that made me think of you\". Or give them as birthday presents.

It\u2019s just Christmas presents, really not that big a deal.", "I\u2019m not clear on whether that was an argument or just a comment. OP said there wasn\u2019t a positive or negative response to it. In any case, it wasn\u2019t a resolution. The original situation basically feels like it\u2019s not done, like I\u2019m waiting for act three before I can really opine on it. Which is even odder-feeling because it\u2019s such an anemic situation to start with - sure storing gifts for later giving, returning, giving to someone else etc, is a wee pain in the ass, but really minimal.", "Because communication is helpful and more pleasant than being passive-aggressive.", "They do get to dictate what happens to them tho is all I'm saying.", "Oh yeah SIL probably deserves the benefit of the doubt from us here on Reddit, but OP or her husband should probably hear SILs side of the story & figure out what her role is. Or at the very least inform her that the presents have already been purchased, that way if SIL is an innocent bystander she has a chance to grab presents if she hasn't already", "I didn't mean it to be angry, I just wouldn't give time to someone deciding something without discussing it with me. Definitely wise if the OP has the patience. \ud83d\udda4", "It\u2019s not passive aggressive to ignore it and proceed.", "Fair enough to decide what they are doing/not doing and to request that no-one gets gifts for them, but based on the OP it sounds like they have said that none of the adults can get gifts for anyone except the kids. That\u2019s just not for them to decide.", "I definitely get that. They are in no position to dictate how other people choose to celebrate the holiday. My comment was meant specifically between OP/husband and MIL/SIL.", "NTA but tell everyone before hand or turn it into a game like a white elephant that you are hosting.", "NTA.  Just give the people the gifts you purchased.  If they feel bad, it is on them, not on you.   You can explain you are an early bird and had already purchased these gifts before you were told of no gifts.  Also let them know how good it makes you feel to be able to gift them these things.  \n\nI hope you have a Merry Christmas!", "Never so happy to be Jewish", "NTA.  If this is how it's going to be done in the future, it should have been AGREED UPON by everyone last Christmas.  Just give your gifts, be happy, and don't buy any next year.  Never mind what mil thinks.", "I wouldn't talk about it anymore. Give the gifts on Christmas day.", "NTA, a 'no gift' policy brought in nine days before the event is ridiculous. Just because she left shopping to the last minute doesn't mean you should go along with it.\n\nAlso OMG of course you can give your grandmother a gift. Your MIL is not the boss of your Christmas.\n\nHave your husband let her know politely it's too late to change the gift plans but you absolutely don't expect gifts from any adults.", "NTA\n\nThey waited until 9 days before Christmas. There are some years where I\u2019ve been done shopping by early December. This was a decision that should have been made much earlier.", "I live in the wrong part of the world. Baby Jesus and the angels need to bring mamma a Lexus and some Gucci.", "NTA. Bc they didn\u2019t budget time to shop no one gets gifts? Fuck that. They can be scrooges all they want but if I were you I\u2019d still hand out the presents you bought.", "If I come across something that feels right for a particular person and is small enough to hide in my closet, I'll buy it no matter how early in the year it is. I've bought and stashed Christmas presents as early as May. If all is going well, I'll have at least a third of my shopping done by November, and Black Friday is just a reminder that I need to kick into high gear to finish out the rest by the first week of December.\n\nI hate scrambling to figure out presents in December. It's too stressful and I never feel like I have enough time to find the right things. So I don't do that to myself anymore --by nine days out I'm at most waiting on a few things to show up in the mail.", "Yeah I\u2019m happy if I have my shopping done entirely by Thanksgiving honestly, that\u2019s what I shoot for. If someone told me 9 days before Christmas that there would be no gifts they\u2019d just get a \u201cwellll I already bought gifts, so too bad\u201d", "Seriously. Nine days ahead of the holiday? If things are going well I'll not only have bought everything by then, but it'll be wrapped and ready to go. Nine days is ridiculously short notice.", "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing\\_Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_Day)", "That's so fucked up. \"We lied to you and you believed us, and now we think you're the bad person\". WTAF is wrong with them?", "Oh yes, wikipedia, the most reliable of sources.\n\nNone of that says what you said, and, again, I live in a Commonwealth country. It's not universally true even if it is in some."]}
