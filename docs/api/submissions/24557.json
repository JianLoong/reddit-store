It just causes problems.BF is kind of an asshole.", "You sound kinda smug that you caused your stepsisters boyfriend to dump her and then started dating him.\n\nSince your stepdad mentioned the job to both of you, I\u2019d say you weren\u2019t the asshole in this situation (you were a better applicant).\n\nNTA (in this situation) but you kinda seem like an asshole in general.", "NTA.  Good luck with your new job.  The best revenge is living well, so do your best.", "I think your stepfather is a bit of an asshole for putting both of you in this position. Given your history, giving you the same lead on a job was cruel at best. Unpopular opinion here, but personally, if you had any idea that your stepsister planned to apply, then I think YTA. \n\nYou say that your bf \"pursued you for a year\"....but someone who is any good at shutting down a guy's advances would not have had the year-long pursuit. They would have called the police to report a stalker. I definitely get the vibes that you were leading him on for a year. You \\*have\\* taken enough from her. Why would anyone compete with someone they've already demoralized?", "NTA\n\nAnd how would she know shed get the job after you turn it down and not someone else?", "NTA. If the company wanted to hire her, they would have offered her the job. Maybe they looked at her social media and saw how immature she acts. Edit to add it\u2019s bonkers to claim you are a jerk for \u201cstealing\u201d her bf. You are not being smug either. What are other commenters seeing that I\u2019m not? You did nothing to cause their breakup. You also didn\u2019t agree to date him for a year.", "NTA for the job thing but you are a terrible sister.  Just awful.", "YTA \n\nFor stealing her boyfriend when she brought him to meet the family. She just needs to cut you out of her life.

Did she have a chance?\n\nYou didn't cheat with her boyfriend, but it is still icky, so you do have making up to do, but not if she isn't in the running for the job..", "NTA for accepting the job. Step sister wasn't offered the job, if you turned it down doesn't mean she would be offered. That's an entitlement mentality.\n\nNo onto dating her ex. That really does read like you're a woman intent on hurting her.  That's just beyond cruel.", "NTA. It's not your fault that the job chose you over her, and there's no way to tell if you turned it down that they'd have given it to her. I get her ire as she's clearly still sore that your fiance broke up with her for you. She's allowed to have those feelings, and it wasn't an excellent look, but 4 months to 2 years.... and it's not like he tried to pursue you while dating her. And you turned him away for quite a time. It would have been nice if she gave her blessing or didn't mind but I don't think you should have to give up on the love of your life because you met in an awkward way and it caused some pain. You shouldn't have to bend over backwards forever to make her happy, because where is the line drawn? Hopefully it will sting less as time moves on and hopefully she'll find the love of *her* life, and/or a more fulfilling job, etc. that makes her feel golden.", "You sound like the worst thing that's ever happened to Maggie and you will never stop making her broken. I wonder why? Why this hatred?", "Come on, girl. Be for real, did you really want that job? I can't help but feel like you did it because she wanted it. You stole her man because I refuse to believe you two barely spoke that night. You can't pay me enough to believe that. Going off the assumption that you actually wanted the job NTA, but your step sister isn't either because it definitely looks like you like robbing her.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t think this has anything to do with you getting the job, I think Maggie is still angry that her ex-boyfriend chose you over her, so she\u2019s taking her anger and frustration out on you.\n\nNTA, for getting the job congratulations on that, but I do think that the boyfriend is acting a little weird, i\u2019m not sure why, but it\u2019s just a little weird the way he broke up with your sister and pursued you, I also can\u2019t blame Maggie, I mean granted she is angry, but it\u2019s possible she\u2019s more angry at her, ex, so she\u2019s blaming you for that, because her ex broke up with her and pursued you, so she sees you as competition.", "NTA for taking the job. Dad told you both. Had she gotten the job, would you have been mad? Only one of you can have it.\n\nHOWEVER, as for the boyfriend, unless your sister broke up with him, and then you guys met up again later in life, this wasn't a great look for you.\n\nHe broke up with her because of meeting you at family's house.  Even if you waited a year, she knows he broke up with her as soon as he met you.", "NTA for taking the job. You don\u2019t know it would have gone to her if you had turned it down. You don\u2019t owe her that even for the situation in which you were TA with your/her boyfriend.", "NTA about the job. You did not take it from her - the company made the decision to offer it to you based on your qualifications and, I assume, your interview. And, even if you did turn it down, there was no guarantee that they would offer the position to your step sister as opposed to some other candidate.\n\nNow, about the boyfriend - it seems like that is the real reason why she is mad, but that isn't what this post is asking for judgement on.", "This is messy as quite frankly you shouldn't be dating HER ex boyfriend without substantial time between him being with her and then with you. What he did to her, he can do to you. As for the job, thatis separate but I get why Maggie is \"ballistic\". NTA for taking the job.", "NTA for taking the job but you kind of broke code with the bf. Actually it's a red flag. If he didn't to her odds are he's going to eventually do it to you. Why do people think their situation is going to be different somehow.", "NTA. Haters gonna hate. You owe her nothing.", "NTA in any way shape or fashion.", "You have a planned engagement time frame?  Aren\u2019t they a surprise?", "NTA\n\nThe company had both your resumes. For whatever reason, they chose to offer the job to you and not Maggie. \n\nYou turning down the job wouldnt necessarily mean they would offer it to Maggie, so her reasoning is flawed.\n\nAs for the boyfriend issue. You waited a year before you would agree to go out with him, which gave Maggie plenty of time to work things out with him. But she didnt (or couldnt) so you werent the AHole there either.", "NTA about the job bc fair enough they offered it to you. If you turn it down there is no guarantee they will offer it to her.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re not my sister. The boyfriend thing was savage.

If the info about him being smitten with you got out though that would be an ah thing to do. \nThe job thing, you both applied and you got the job fairly.

I had to be honest about it otherwise the story would make her look completely nuts.", "He told me about the job first, and he never said he was going to mention it to her.

That\u2019s ludicrous.", "Firstly, yeah I did want the job. My stepdad told me about it before he told her. I didn\u2019t even know he\u2019d told her until after we both applied. \n\nAnd yes, we did barely speak. We were at a table with Maggie, our parents, and my two other stepsiblings, we literally couldn\u2019t even have spoken that much.", "She didn't date him for a year after he broke up with the stepsister.", "The situation is already different. They were together 4 months, we\u2019ve been together for two years. He continued to ask me out for longer than he was even with her.

It\u2019s not like he cheated on Maggie because he broke up with her right away, and OP didn\u2019t shack up with him right away either. He pursued her for a year, longer than he was with Maggie in the first place. It\u2019s kind of a strange situation, for sure, and I can see why Maggie would be humiliated and hurt by that happening, but I don\u2019t think this situation is as bad as everyone is making it out to be. We can call OP an AH for that I suppose, but I\u2019d say the boyfriend is a bigger AH in that case. And yeah, strong NTA about the job thing. You\u2019re right, if OP didn\u2019t take the job, it\u2019s not a given than Maggie would have got it lmao. At the age of 28 you gotta stop competing with everyone around you and just live your damn life.", "He wasn't Maggie's bf. He was her EX boyfriend.  He broke up with Maggie. OP didn't break them up.  And it was a year later they started dating. Once a couple breaks up, they have NO say-so in who the other dates, whether it's a stranger, a friend or, yes, a family member.

As a parent, I cannot understand hurting my own child like this. \"Hmmm...given their history, let me tell them both about the same job opportunity.

After meeting, 'getting pursued by', then hooking up with stepsister's boyfriend, I think that it would make sense to stay as far from any kind of subsequent competition with her as possible. There is too much history there. After plunging the boyfriend knife in her back, that becomes the history for any future events.", "Does it matter when he was actively pursuing her for over year after they broke up? Step sister is going to be seeing this all take place. \n\nThis is a messy situation and why people shouldn\u2019t date their siblings ex\u2019s. It only brings the drama.", "4 years, 8 years...as soon as that real bad patch hits you will see if that same behavior pops up. Maybe you'll be one of those \"lucky\" ones but those are few and far between.", "She says in her post that he broke up with her stepsister two days before he started dating her. What are you seeing that I'm missing.", "I don't mean physical space, i mean emotional.\n\nYou dated her boyfriend. You're definitely in her space.\n\nI agree, the job is rightfully yours, but the way you describe the bf situation is a bit... twisted.", "Stepsister didn't date her boyfriend.", "That\u2019s fair.

But I get that is makes both of us look like complete jerks.", "That\u2019s fair. But that can happen to anybody. Anybody\u2019s boyfriend/husband can do that. I get if he\u2019d cheated on her but he didn\u2019t. Again, he could dump me for somebody else, but anybody could.", "No, she says that bf broke up with sister 2 days after meeting her. It was a year beyond that before they started dating.", "And pursued her for a YEAR before she agreed to go out with him.", "It is twisted. There\u2019s no way to say it that\u2019s not weird as hell. Who wants to tell people they met the man they\u2019re going to marry at a lunch to meet his gf\u2019s parents. It\u2019s gross. But I can\u2019t change it", "As I understand, OP is dating her ex. And she started to date him after a year he became her ex.", "Like I said, NTA for the job.\n\nYou\u2019re an asshole in general and so is your bf. It\u2019s a massive dick move. I wouldn\u2019t do it to my sister because I have some class.", ">But I get that is makes both of us look like complete jerks.\n\nBoth you & your boyfriend, right?\nYour sister doesn't look like a jerk.", "Better make up a better story. If you kept telling that and I were her, I'd feel humiliated every time.", "I am sorry, I don't get it. Her ex is a person with his own life and preferences, not a slave or property of OP's step sister just because she met him first. He had every right to stop relationship with her any time. As I understand OP never encouraged his break up with her sis and did not agree to date him for a year. And I don't see her fault in this break up. what I would do - I'd go LC or NC with her just to live separate life, preferably far away.", "Yeah I meant me and my bf", "Everyone who knows both of us already knows. But that\u2019s just family. We don\u2019t have overlapping social circles", "It's women code; just one of those things you don't do", "I do understand codes when we speak about flirting with your friend's or sister's BF. We are talking about ex of 1 year, who happened to realize he is dating wrong person. I don't think he should pay for this mistake for his whole life just because of codes. But I am old and not competitive at all, I believe life is short to spend it on punishing people."]}
