It's not your fault that the job chose you over her, and there's no way to tell if you turned it down that they'd have given it to her.

She's allowed to have those feelings, and it wasn't an excellent look, but 4 months to 2 years.... and it's not like he tried to pursue you while dating her. And you turned him away for quite a time. It would have been nice if she gave her blessing or didn't mind but I don't think you should have to give up on the love of your life because you met in an awkward way and it caused some pain.

It was a year beyond that before they started dating.", "And pursued her for a YEAR before she agreed to go out with him.", "It is twisted. There\u2019s no way to say it that\u2019s not weird as hell. Who wants to tell people they met the man they\u2019re going to marry at a lunch to meet his gf\u2019s parents. It\u2019s gross.

We are talking about ex of 1 year, who happened to realize he is dating wrong person. I don't think he should pay for this mistake for his whole life just because of codes. But I am old and not competitive at all, I believe life is short to spend it on punishing people.", "Honestly it's extremely fucking weird that the dude barely spoke to you at a meet-the-family function and then broke up with his girlfriend for you. That's on him, but on you... I would have stopped talking to him after he broke up with my stepsister? Instead of giving him the chance to keep asking me out for a year? Like literally why were you even in contact with this random guy, that you only knew as your stepsister's asshole date to a family dinner? I would say I'm surprised you didn't ignore or block him, but I guess \"attention seeking and self centered horny 23 yr old\" is some kind of archetype  \n\nNta for the job thing. It sounds like you were both given the information about the job at the same time and both encouraged to apply; you apparently didn't even know she was also applying until rather late in the process.  Also stepsister needs to work on her emotional regulation, because going ballistic at you and on social media is probably just making her look unhinged. But her situation does definitely suck.  And I highly doubt you have bent over backward for her in any way, so I'm confused by what you mean about \"bending over backward for her forever\". Obviously she just needs to cut you out of her life and pretend you don't exist. Which the stepfather is apparently making difficult, so he's the a h for that...", "What about if you think about it from the perspective of the bf?\n\nHis gf brought him home to meet her parent. \n\nHe saw the sister & dumped his gf and hit on the sister unrelenting for a year.\n\nIf they simply ran into each other after a year, it would be different.  He actively pursued her immediately after breaking up with her sister.\n\nThat's uncool, at the very least.", "NAH her feelings about you overall are valid, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong about the job", "NTA for the job , that's the way the world works. \n\n\nnow onto the other thing, you don't think it's completely weird to date your step sisters ex, when the only reason he dumped her was to persue you? I could never that's just wrong on so many levels not to mention the two of you wouldn't of even met if not for your step sister.", "NTA but going on social media won't help her out.. jobs look at people's  social media... the boyfriend yeah the AH", "NTA\n\nThe whole bf situation IS kind of sticky but as I replied somewhere earlier, it's not like he cheated on her with you or you just had a meaningless fling. I understand her and the feeling you're out to \"get\" her, but what does she expect you to do, not have a job or boyfriend cause she wants the exact same ones?\n\nAt the end of the day, you got offered the job because you obviously either have more experience or credentials and if she has an issue with that, she should work and become better at her job", "NTA but you're not a very nice person.\n\n I mean, if you did give up the job it doesn't mean she'd get it. But it wasn't nice of you to go for the job she really wanted.\n\nYTA for dating her boyfriend though. There are 8 billion people on the earth, but you chose the 1 person that your sister really wanted.", "NTA for the job thing but you have bigger problems in that either you encouraged the attention of your stepsister\u2019s boyfriend (asshole to her) or you are marrying your stalker who fell for a fantasy version of you he concocted in his head and then pursued you relentlessly (still asshole to her for caving in but also to yourself for getting tangled up in the marinara bunting).", "NTA, you were offered the job, she wasn't.\n\nThe boyfriend situation, it was 4 months of dating, it wasn't like they were engaged.

Never will. Sounds like she\u2019s happy there, so I\u2019m happy for her. Sometimes, we need space to see that.", "NTA.

I would have just tried to give her some space and have some grace. \n\nThe bf wasn't a mutual friend, nor was it a high school boyfriend or even a brief college fling. I'd get it more if that was the case. If he was Maggie's age, he was 26 when he decided it was appropriate to dump his gf after meeting her sister and then pursue her sister. It's a gross ass story.

That's  just gross.", "So what\u2026she had zippo to do with him breaking it off and waited a year efore dating him. Sis needs to\u2026get over it.", "So he did the one thing everyone on reddit tells cheaters they should have done before cheating. \n\nHe didn't cheat on Maggie with OP. He broke up with Maggie when he realised he likes someone else more and didn't date OP straight away, OP took a year to say yes which means he had liked her for 3times as long as he had dated Maggie.\n\nAnd yet, OP is just supposed to bend over and give up a job that she had been deemed more suitable for than Maggie. There is also no guarantee that Maggie would have gotten the job even if OP gave it up.\n\nOP is NTA.", "Precisely", "No one said fault, they said smug, this entire story didn\u2019t need any info on the bf being \u201csmitten\u201d. You know who sucks? The guy who meets your parents and dumps you after to go after your sis! I think most of us are uncomfortable that sister just doesn\u2019t get that, you can change sister to cousin, friend, anyone you\u2019re remotely dealing with and it\u2019s not just weird but kinda shitty of them.", "Sounds like you have got with a relative/friends ex in the past and you are trying to justify in your head tbf", "Lol because what? People can't reject advances and then give it a try after a year? Op didn't pursue the relationship and only finally went out with him after a persistent year of him trying to woo her.\n\nSounds to me she knew it was weird and even respected stepsis enough not to pursue a relationship. In the end it wasn't OP's fault her BF had broken up with stepsis because he was smitten with OP. Hell even if OP didn't? They would have still broken up."]}
