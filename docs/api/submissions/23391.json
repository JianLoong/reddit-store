You didn't leave because of her medical condition, you left because of the consequences of how she was handling it. \n\nIf she had told you early on, you could've planned your life out differently, you could've done things to make life with the condition more livable for both of you. On top of that she betrayed you, no matter how you put it, lying for 20 years about a chronic life altering medical condition is betrayal. Even if you want to forgive, it's not easy to trust someone after that.", "NTA, she deliberately hid a major life-limiting chronic illness from you for years and because of that it had a much greater negative affect on your life than it might have otherwise.", "NTA. She lied and kept a medical condition from you. A serious one. However... I guess I can see why. She was scared you would be judgmental... Turns out you were.", "NTA - You're both better off now.", "NTA\n\nAs someone with a medical condition, this isn't ok. My own standards for dating is having a conversation with the other person and just saying \"Hey, I have xyz, this is lifelong. If you don't think you can handle this it's 100% ok, I just need to let you know. I won't be mad if you don't want go any further.\" It's so simple. \n\nHonestly, she lied to you. She lied to you for years and her parents upheld the lie. And then they just keep pushing it under the rug even after you're married and have brought a child into the world. Not to mention her never revealing this until after ya'll had a baby is wild. She had a huge chance of flaring/relapsing during pregnancy, then what? How does she explain that? You deserved to be told at least before she was even pregnant so you could prepare yourselves and come up with a strategy in cased she relapsed.", "NTA:\n\nHonestly I can totally understand her reluctance to discuss her medical issues with you at an early stage of the relationship. That can be an exceptionally uncomfortable conversation and could end the relationship as the impact of living with someone who has medical issues can be draining both physically and mentally for all involved.\n\nHowever you know what's worse than those awkward conversations? Not having them at all and just hoping it never comes up. \n\nI can totally understand how emotionally horrific this must be for you both. You are suddenly second guessing if you can trust your partner as they've withheld important information for a long time and the impact on you, her, your child, it's shit for everyone involved. \n\nIt's absolutely worth going to couples counselling and seeing if there is a way forward, regardless of what's happened you both have a long history and a family. Don't throw that away without thinking long and hard about it. It's absolutely worth remembering that the chances are she didn't mention it early on due to the fear of losing you, a mistake but a mistake made because they where afraid. The only person who can decide what to do next is you, I wish you all the best.", "INFO. If you had known she had MS, would you have married her? You're not TA if you left because she lied to you, but you're kinda TA if you left because she had MS.", "I'm leaving towards YTA but there are factors here.\n\nShe absolutely shouldnt have lied, however I understand why she didn't tell you. I've been fortunate but I've also seen far too many people remain single and hurt because of other peoples fear and the stigma about people living with disabilities that they often don't give someone a chance. We don't know you or know how you think but at least to me to what you said it appears like its more than about the lying and even if you've never consciously thought it or been aware of it, maybe you wouldn't have given her a chance if she had been honest about it from the start and by walking away it looks exactly like that. That's what makes you seem like TA even if it weren't aware of that feeling. \nAlso, the amount you were doing wouldn't have changed regardless of if you knew about it or not. Although I get it can be a lot to handle, you knowing doesn't change her ability of what she can and can't do.\nSo can you honestly and whole heartdly say you would have chosen her if you'd known about her health?\n\nIts done now and a few years have passed so there's no point in dwelling on it and I am really glad that you are both amicable and still get on well so I'd encourage you to keep being that way with eachother but also think about what you want from the future when you meet someone else", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The first time I took her to my parents house for lunch they told me \"son, do whatever you want but there's something wrong with her\". She told me she had an eye nerve  inflammation and diopter in her eyes are different, hence clumsiness, even though she is wearing glasses.\n9 years into dating, we discovered a lump on her stomach. Doctor found huge myomas outside her uterus, suggested a surgery and that if we are planning on marrying and having kids that we should do it as soon as her body will be capable of carrying out the pregnancy.\nWe loved each other, naturally. So we rushed into arranging marriage, she had a surgery, recovered and two years after we are married and she's pregnant. Clumsiness is always there, always the same. \n7 years into marriage. We have a beautiful, smart boy. I'm working, she's not, tried to find a job twice, didn't turn out well and she gave up. She's stay at home mom but she's not cleaning, cooking or anything  else. Every time I get home from work I am greeted by a piece of half thawed meat and an excuse.\nI'm doing all the cleaning, cooking, homework  and most of the patenting, homework, playing, bathing, putting to bed, etc.\nAnd then a relapse came, the first one after 20 years (which I realised later on). \nShe went to see a doctor and she couldn't hide it anymore from me. She has MS, mild type. All the pieces sat in their place. She knew, her family knew. Her first relapse was six months before we started dating. And every time I tried to start a conversation about it she and her family would either ignore me or start a new topic completely.\nCOVID came. I feel betrayed, crushed, living on a autopilot for two years, working, cooking, cleaning, pushing through the pandemia with all that on my chest. Intimacy is completely gone. Can't muster the courage to leave her, knowing that there's no chance to get the custody of my son.\nSleep is getting worse and worse, one morning I wake up with chest pain. I knew if I don't get out of it I'll go crazy. Decided to tell her I'm leaving, a bit of drama and arguing bur everything went rather peacefully. \nTwo years later (present day), I'm a completely new man, happy, still single but I don't care about that, I'm happy being by myself. We have a shared custody over out son, he's with me wed-sun and with her sun-wed. We are on good terms, we are able to make an agreement about everything regarding out son. Once she even told me I was the best husband a woman could have.\n\nStill, every now and then I feel like an asshole for leaving her. So, am I the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

All good in the hood.. unbuckle your guilt braces and breathe a little", "Absolutely, our son is the best student in his class. He seems happy, socially active, and completely unaffected by our divorce. Everything we decide about him and his activities we do in front of him so he can see that mom and dad are on the same page. I am a completely different person, my mother said to me a year after the divorce, \"I'm happy to see you laughing again\" which I didn't even notice, that I wasn't laughing before. I noticed she looked better and started working out and getting fitter. I'm glad for her, but that's all I know or care about her at this point.", "Thanks, I'm glad to hear this from someone who understands the condition. Although her type is not progressive and very mild, I was giving her Copaxone for the last two years of marriage every 2nd night. I was fine with it, I could live for the rest of our lives with it,  but constantly getting back to the thought that I was lied to was eating me from the inside.", "I don\u2019t think that is a fair statement. They might have been able to do things differently if she had been honest from the start.", "NTA. This is a serious disease and she tricked her husband into supporting her for years. He left because of the deceit. Maybe he would have left after he find out, but we will never know. She never gave him the choice. Fuck her.", "I don't mind her medical condition. As I already answered to another redditor, her MS is relapsing, not progressive. Physically, she is the same person she was on the first day I met her. It's the lying that she and her whole family were a part of.", "Yes, turns out he's judgmental about being lied to over a period of many years. NTA", "Thanks, I'm thinking exactly like you. You're not getting into short-term agreement. You're getting into lifelong commitment. Everything has to be on the table. I'm sure I'd stay with her. Even if it was progressive type. I would understand her unwillingness to do stuff, I'd be ready to care for her  even if she would end up bedridden. She is my wife after all, I loved her. Now, all I want is to have as less possible contact with her.", "Probably. Her type is not progressive but relapsing. She hasn't changed in any way for the past 20 years. What hurt me the most is lying and unwillingness to pull her weight in the family. She'd rather go out with her mother shopping, leave our son with her father instead of taking care of the home and lunch. Which I had to do every day when I got back from work.", "Thanks, and bear in mind. I decided to marry her despite the fact she had multiple huge myomas, and the question was if she would be able to carry out the pregnancy with them. 95% of men would walk away, and I decided to stay because I loved her and was ready to grow old with her, kids, or no kids.", "Unreal that he's doing so good. Be proud of yourselves as parents \ud83d\udc4f", ">95% of men would walk away\n\n95% of men who value their partner first and foremost for their ability to give birth, perhaps. There are plenty more than 5% of men who would stay with a partner they love, even if it meant no biological children.", "> I decided to marry her despite the fact she had multiple huge myomas\n\nThat makes you the AH. Her value is not tied to her reproductive abilities. Another thing that makes you the AH is total unwillingness to see that she might have been unable to do her share of chores due to her illness.", "I get what you're saying but as someone who's looked after people living with MS (and I live with both reproductive and internal physical disabilties) it is a lot and I do absolutely get that, but it does appear like you left when you became aware of the extent and also appears as though you having been viewing her as lazy even if you haven't meant to. I don't look disabled and it would look to other people and my fh that I can do alot, but no one is living in my body to know how I'm really effected. I used to dance and still go out for walks, play with my kids etc i have to keep going and exercise, so again, no one would know to look at me so I understand why people assume when there's other things and times I can't do things. As I said I'm lucky because my fh took the time to research and has stayed, but I'm sure he forgets sometimes and becomes frustrated. I'm not completely calling you TAH because I get that its hard to understand but I also get what she was more than likely feeling/thinking. It may be sounding more harsher to you than how I'm meaning it maybe, but its difficult to get across when it's typing", "I'm just pointing out the truth: the vast majority of men would get out of that situation before the marriage. Her physical state is not at all affected by it. She's just a bit clumsy, that's all. She can do house chores and cook when she feet like. Which was maybe twice a year. Now, she's taking a pilates class, so her physical condition is not affected by her illness.", "I understand completely, I saw what she was capable of, and when she would say that she couldn't do something, I was fine with it. It was the lying that her whole family took part of that pushed me over the edge. Even before the official diagnosis, I had absolutely no time for myself because the whole household was my responsibility.", "Odds are she's taking those pilates classes to improve her physical health.\n\nHow frequently is she taking those classes and how long does she have to rest afterwards?", ">I'm just pointing out the truth: the vast majority of men would get out of that situation before the marriage.\n\nIt can't be truth, considering that around 50 percent of women have myomas.\n\n>Her physical state is not at all affected by it. She's just a bit clumsy, that's all.\n\nThere is no such kind of MS that would not affect the physical state of the ill person. Even in the do called benign MS one of the main symptoms are overwhelming fatigue ans brain fog.", "No idea about the rest. Our son says she goes twice a week.", "Yes, in their post mid-life period stage and not that big. Her largest was 13cm big and a few around 6cm. And a dozen of smaller ones. Big ones were surgically removed, but the doctor warned us that they would keep growing, hence the hurry with conceiving a child.\n\nShe did get tired easier, but I was always understanding about it. Even when I wasn't aware of her true medical condition.", "If you don't know how long she has to rest afterwards, you shouldn't hold them up as an example of how unaffected she is by her illness.", ">Yes, in their post mid-life period stage and not that big.\n\nAgain, not true. Myoma's growth is stimulated by estrogen. Production of that hormone reduces radically in post mid-life stage, so it's quite rare for myomas to develop that late. Myomas are typical for women in reproductive age. 6 cm is a lower limit for medium sized myomas (these under 5 are considered small). 13 cm, yes, that one was big, but not enormous. So nope, you don't get hailed a hero for not dumping a woman because she had some reproductive health issues.", "I don't know how much she has changed for the past two years, but she was not that affected by, let's say, an active day out (whole day bbq outside of town, in the nature). She would feel tired in the afternoon, but after a one hour nap, she would suggest a short walk through the city.", "I'm not asking to be hailed a hero, I'm just pointing out that a lot of men would not accept a marriage where they're not sure whether they would have kids or not.", "All activities are not equal. \n\nWhen I suffered from fatigue post covid cooking and vacuuming were insurmountable obstacles that would take me out for the rest of the day and sometimes more. I could still go to the grocery store or spend an evening with friends on good days, but I'd be bedridden the next."]}
