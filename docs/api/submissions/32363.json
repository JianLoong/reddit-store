Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. I'll say that I'm from a similar situation.\n\nYou're the child in a relationship where your father was an absentee for whatever reason. This is, unfortunately for him, the consequence of neglecting his daughter for 21 years.\n\nDo not succumb to pressure to accept an apology that you are not ready to accept.  You will wind up resenting it and anyone who forced you before you were ready.\n\nI know you've heard bad stories about your father -- were they from your mom or from grandma and auntie as well?\n\nEither way, I think it will become important for you to see and decide for yourself based on firsthand experience via a conversation with your dad, someday. Everyone has their own bias/interpretation of the truth based on their own personal feelings, and if he were my dad, I'd wanna know his side--if only because that's part of MY story, and I want to know where I came from and the two different perspectives and life experiences that went into my creation. You might hear something from him that helps you release some of the anger you might have from his neglect, or something that makes the abandonment issues you might grapple with a little bit easier to overcome. And that doesn't mean you have to have a relationship with him at all, after that--it can be a one and done conversation! It can be whatever you want it to be, but ONLY if/when you are ready.\n\nI will say I had a half brother I didn't contact because of my mostly absentee father. (Basically, my half brother lived w/ my father, who was always too busy with his 'other' family to care about me/replaced me w/ them, in my eyes.) I think I was scared to disrupt my half brother's life b/c I knew how hard it was to deal with having family that SHOULD be there, but just never was. As an adult, I'd, instead, eventually reached out to a cousin of ours -- my way of dipping my toes in to test to see if I felt okay with it without hurting him, or so I thought. He heard about it and found me on social and DM'd me some scathing stuff out of hurt. I could feel the deep cut, the abandonment, the way he'd longed for me to be in his life ... it all came out. And I was blindsided by it -- I was literally staying away to avoid bringing drama into his life, I thought it was better that way. And that sort of humanized a parental perspective for me -- that yeah, it is possible for parents to think their kids are better off without them. Just like I thought my half brother's life was better off without my drama / those old feelings being all kicked up for him. And he didn't feel it was better at all. (Turned out, he missed me. But he never reached out, either. And what we wound up with was a lot of wasted time and hurt feelings.)\n\nWe can be self-righteous and hold onto the ideals of what a parent should and shouldn't do. But parents are people. They struggle, they're flawed, they make the wrong decisions. They have fears of rejection, just like we do. And some people DO try to be better people.\n\nSo again, I realize everyone's emotional and his part of the family wants a happy ending so ya'll can put this behind ya'll and have you all over for holiday dinner (or maybe so your dad won't be disheartened and will continue on this better path for himself instead of succumbing to his inner demons), but that is his journey, not yours.\n\nHe had 21 years to process whatever he was processing. Grandma and auntie should be supportive of whatever TIME you need to process this new development and whatever decision you make, in general. And if they can't, that's their loss -- why do they expect you to be more understanding and empathetic to your father when they cannot find it within themselves to do that for YOU, here and now?\n\nGood luck.", "Grew up without my dad too who did bad things and was in and out of prison. NTA", "NTA.  You aren't responsible for allowing someone into your life who has dismissed your existence.  Biology doesn't trump behavior.", "He had no desire to be in your life and thinks he can pop in now? I read some stories and wish I could throw hands and smack people. \n\nIf your relatives are upset tell them to go sit naked on live electric wires. \n\nThis irritates me especially because I\u2019ve several deadbeat uncles. One was abusive and his wife left with the kids. The father went looking for them after they were grown and they welcomed him with open arms and I was baffled. Like this man used to kick your mom around like a ball. \n\nUgh\u2026", "NTA. Something similar happened to a friend of my family. The husband took off, leaving his wife and two young sons behind, never sending them so much as a postcard. Then years later, when the boys were teenagers, he called out of the blue like nothing happened, saying \"Hey, buddy, this is your father!\" The boy responded \"I don't have a father\" and hung up. Simple, yet effective.", "My grandma on his side is crazy. Now they don't want me to see my aunt or cousins at all. I guess this is a price to pay for not wanting to see my \"dad.\" I mean it hurts but I wasn't very close to my cousin's just my aunt. But now she's turned on me.", "She said nothing he just wanted to have a relationship with me after not raising me. He never wanted to raise me but wanted me in his life is what she said. She said that he said I could make my own decisions now and he was confident I'd want him in my life. He thought wrong lol.", "Yeah I think I will. Sucks my aunt turned against me. But....yeah :/.", "No he's known me. He just didn't want anything to do with me.", "My mom is amazing. My best friend really! And yeah my aunt gave him my number.", "No he didn't.", "Yup. Funny how that works. Kid doesn\u2019t need me so now let me pretend not to be a total deadbeat. Tell Tina, you have no interest in having a relationship with someone who abandons his kids and his responsibilities even if you do share genetics. The fact that you are that kid makes this doubly true.", "Lmao, sure, dude. Calculate how much child supprt he owed and tell him to pay that first.", "Sheesh \ud83d\ude29. But yeah, you\u2019re totally within your rights to not want to mend fences. One caveat is you wanna be ABSOLUTELY sure this is what you want, so you don\u2019t end up falling into a regret pit when he passes away one day. (Which may be something to unpack in therapy just in case)", "And now you don\u2019t want anything to do with him. Idk how this doesn\u2019t make sense. Maybe family wants to play house more than they care about your feelings. Let them go too.", "Yeah. They care a lot about him and out him on a pedestal. But all he's done is cause problems for my mom and never cared about me. So I really don't give an f bout him. This may seem mean but I really don't. He isn't a good person.", "Girl don\u2019t feel guilty. Man waited till you were 21. Sounds like an alcoholic."]}
