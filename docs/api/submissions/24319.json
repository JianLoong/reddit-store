Your Aunt and the other kid's parent are AH here.", "NTA. Kim deserved her candles. That mother is out of line to complain when all you did is try to stop her kid from ruining Kim's bday. You wouldn't need to be doing any back seat parenting if she would do some front seat parenting!", "you saved that childs memories. and your aunt suxx. how can something like that even be remotely allowed. her kids get bullied in front of her eyes and she does nothing. everyonee including the other parents suxxx besides you and your cousin. they are HORRIBLE PPL.

You handled this very well, NTA and little Kim is lucky to have you looking out for her.", "NTA. You wouldn't have needed to back seat parent if her actual mother didn't choose to ignore the problem.

Maybe, if she coukd be bothered to do some front seat parenting, you would not have had to get involved. Bad parent raising a bad kid. She is lucky her kid didn't get kicked out of the party.

Continuing to brush things like this off, as little as they seem, will make Kim feel like her feelings don't matter as she grows older.  Maybe the other kid was just being a kid, but that kid has no manners and doesn't seem to get or care that this was KIM'S day, not theirs.

Yeah she's 5 and it shouldn't happen to her either >:(", "Right? If I was a kid, I would be so excited someone relit them for me. Especially with the childhood I had. I'd be like \"wow I'm important\" but I'm from the forgotten generation so no one would have noticed. Did I have parties? Hahaha this took a turn.", "Yeah I didn't touch her, but why the other guests and the mother were annoyed was because I stopped the party to tell her to move her kid. I tried telling her to move back a bit until her mother moved her back.\nAt first my aunt was a bit surprised, but she kind of laughed it off and was more \"let's just get it over with\" once Kim started crying, idk what her plan was, Kim would stop crying once she had cake?", "Idk she's not really parent material, it's just something in a long list of parenting stuff she has to work on.

(Fat chance my aunt will stop it happening again). She's a tough little thing but this was her first experience, so by the next one she might actually be the one telling the other kid off LOL.", "Believe what you will. I say it happened to me because it did as a child, my mum didn't let me get candles a 2nd time after a kid blew it out, so I felt for my baby cousin and didn't want her to go through it.", "You did the right thing.

Dude do you really believe she's going to face a life of hard bullying, that the other toddler is going to remember it every day and take her anger out on her? I literally said she's rough herself when needs be and if that other toddler somehow remembers this insane injustice I inflicted upon her, and decides to hassle Kim, Kim is going to whoop ass.", "So youd rather let a child get bullied than stand up for them, simply because you feel you have no skin in the game? You are whats wrong with society", "You're actually hilarious. Your point is my baby cousin is going to be bullied now because I stood up for her one instance at her birthday party. Yet you're totally fine with her being bullied all day and during the candle blowing? Just say you wouldn't do shit either if it was your kid and go", "Her* read the post again. I get if you called me an asshole for making a scene, but your point being that because it wasn't my house nor my child, makes it wrong of me to stand up for my cousin, is weird af. That you think 1 instance of not letting her be bullied is going to suddenly lead to a life of bullying and harassment over cake?", "So if you saw an innocent woman getting raped you'd leave her alone because you don't know her? You are an awful human being", "he fixed it", "No. I would let the parents handle it bc at 23 and childless OP doesn\u2019t know what the consequences can be for the child. Every adult decision has ramifications (well even childhood decisions do lol). This could make things exponentially harder on the child. You don\u2019t know why the aunt wasn\u2019t making a bigger deal of it. You\u2019re looking at it from the immediate emotional aspect.", "No. You\u2019re trying to justify it. I am saying the bullying could get exponentially worse. I\u2019m saying the bullying of the child and the dynamics in regards to that could have more lasting of an impact than getting to blow out candles and we don\u2019t know why the aunt decided to let it be. OP is the one who doesn\u2019t have any skin in the game. OP is the one who gets to walk away saying they fixed things when they probably just made things worse long term. Ever been bullied in school? Did some adult standing up to the bully one time then disappearing actually make a difference? (If you say it did you\u2019d be lying) BUT it probably made it worse. And now the cousin is left to deal with that on their own\u2026OP isn\u2019t there to have their back. He\u2019s gone.", "I didn\u2019t say lead a life of bullying. I said the bully would make things worse. But that doesn\u2019t matter to you. The consequences of your actions don\u2019t matter to you bc cousin got to blow out the candles right? If that means the bullying gets worse because the bully didn\u2019t like you stopping them\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter. I mean you aren\u2019t there to see it so who cares right? Oh wait\u2026your cousin would care bc they are the one who has to deal with the bully every day\u2026not you.", "The parents didn't do anything, op asked them to control their child multiple times. If you're so pathetic at parenting that you find it easier to let your child bully others, you are a failure. That child would be crushed if she saw everyone in her family ignoring her mistreatment. You're the one getting emotional, you'd rather let the bully get away with their actions than simply correct their behavior, because of hypothetical what ifs. Look at the facts, a child was being bullied and no one was stopping it. Either your children are bullies or they no longer speak to you", "\"Could\" it could get worse. You are throwing a tantrum over something that doesn't exist, has not happened, has no proof of happening, and is entirely speculation. You genuinely think that allowing a child to be bullied, simply because op doesn't have any skin in the game? (thanks for using my phrase, even if you understood it wrong). People like you, who value tradition and authority over fairness and equality, sicken me. Your only issue with op standing up for her is that he won't be able to in the future, meaning youd rather let the child suffer than do anything to stop it. For all we know, op stepping in was the push needed to make the bully no longer a bully. If your entire argument is imaginary and based on stuff that hasn't happened, then we can both say whatever we want and its just as valid.", "You've chosen a weird hill to die on. Assuming multiple times my family dynamics, I see my baby cousin multiple times a week and she hasn't come crying about some kid harrasing her since the party a couple days ago.", "So ask yourself this question: why didn\u2019t the aunt stop it? What dynamics are at play? Why did the aunt feel it wasn\u2019t in the best interest to have the parents step up? Why did the aunt not try to rearrange the children \u201cfor a family picture\u201d and move the child away? Why didn\u2019t the aunt do something? The facts are: the aunt, in her own home, made a decision regard her child\u2026why that decision was made I don\u2019t know. We can speculate until we all pass out. But at the end of the day\u2026she made a decision about her child in her home. You don\u2019t know why she made those decisions. But we do know that Kim will have to continue dealing with the bully.", "Yes bc a bully only does it on your birthday. You were wrong. Not your house. Not your child. Not your decision. You don\u2019t know all the dynamics at play and you don\u2019t have to deal with the consequences. I get that you\u2019re ok with that bc your cousin blew out her candles. Great. But you don\u2019t have to live with their behaviors for getting upset. Your aunt and cousin do. And with that\u2026I\u2019m out bc you don\u2019t want to hear opinions. You want people to tell you you\u2019re right and you were a brave strong person for pushing a 5 yo out of the way. So props to you.", "This is my last reply to you cuz it's exhausting at this point. I said in another comment my aunt isn't the best mother, so her overlooking bullying to her child is one of her many faults, and that she was shocked the child blew out the candles but continued with the party anyway. She wasn't happy with me because she's a \"don't make a scene\" type person, and yes, that's at the expense of her child being bullied. Kim isn't dealing with anything rn man", "So your entire argument is based on hypothetical questions, and instead of blaming the irresponsible parents you blame the one person who came to the childs aid. You are a flawed human and i hope you can fend for yourself the way you expect actual children to.", "You don't know all the dynamics at play, so who are you to speculate what may or may not happen? It takes a special kind of low life to let a child get bullied, no matter how many imaginary scenarios you can come up with", "NTA. I\u2019m so happy that you relit those candles. That\u2019s such a shitty thing of that parent to do; clearly, that child was either never shown consequences, or learned that behavior by watching said parent.", "NTA, your poor cousin", "Thank goodness Kim has a hero like you to teach her she\u2019s worth fighting for. NTA", "NTA,  Your aunt is, though. She should have stood up for her own daughter.", "NTA you were a lot nicer about it than I would've been. I would've waited until it was that little brats birthday and done the same to her", "NTA: good for you. Sad a cousin has to stand up for her because her mom won't.", "NTA. I would've asked the mother \"So if your daughter was celebrating her birthday, and another kid blew out *her* candles, you wouldn't be upset?\"", "NTA, Why tf are the other 'adults' annoyed at the candles being relit. It's Kim's birthday and she deserves her candles if they're important to her. I feel bad for her :(", "Yea OP. NTA. You\u2019re an incredible cousin though! I swear I felt the bond !", "NTA - You wouldn't have to 'back-seat parent' if the bratty kid had an actual front-seat parent.\n\nBlowing out someone else's candles is a HUGE faux pas. it's such a part of tradition that it truly hurts the feelings of the birthday person to have that honor trampled over. Would she still feel that same way if someone showed up to her kids party and blew her candles out? Cause... that should happen.", "NTA. Good for you OP! I'm sure the birthday girl is thankful for you stepping in and helping her and hopefully the mom of that kid takes this as a reality check. I would be horrified if either of my kids did that at someone else's birthday!", "NTA becuz kudos to you for standing up for the cousin, she is going to experience nostalgia from seeing you when she comes over. Bratty kid and mommy couldn't 'ave their own way could they", "\"Well I don't appreciate your lack of parenting, so we're even.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA -- Parents need to stop keeping the peace at the expense of their kids. If someone is mistreating your child, step the fuck up. Otherwise all the children will learn is that they don't deserve to be respected and treated kindly.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Everyone else is though including your aunt.  You're not the one that should've done that, Kim's mother should've done it.  But bc she wasn't going to, you did it for her & you made your little cousin happy.  After all, isn't that the point of the day?  It's HER day & she should be able to blow out HER candles.  You didn't make a scene.  Your aunt & the other kid's mother are the ones that made the scene.", "\"The tree remembers, the axe forgets\"\n\nShe's gonna remember that you did this for her for the rest of her life, good on you \n\nNTA", "Noman. If I were that kid on my birthday, I'd be happy that you thought I was important enough to relight them for me.
