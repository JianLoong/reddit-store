My last job was entirely WFH and while great at first, I wound up hating it because :\n\n1) It felt too easy to get trapped indoors considering my gaming PC was the one I also did work from - I would work, and immediately start gaming after clocking out only to realize I\u2019d been sitting in the same spot for like 13 hours \n\n2) I snack a lot so I was burning through our groceries like crazy \n\n3) My gf\u2019s two cats are a pain in the ass. Dont get me wrong, I love them both dearly but they\u2019re so annoying if you don\u2019t constantly pander to them. They\u2019ll meow very loudly nonstop for hours and eventually start getting destructive for attention \n\n4) My gf WFH full time and she (understandably) has a lot of meetings and phone calls to take, but shes also really loud to be around. Shes kinda clumsy and will often drop something super heavy once every few hours. She also smokes weed all during her shift and she coughs like crazy every time and its just annoying to hear someone borderline gagging every 30 minutes \n\nDont get me wrong I smoke too but I have a very strict boundary between work, and my personal life. I work in corporate finance so I don\u2019t want to be high when dealing with clients money and I feel like being around her and seeing her smoke will tempt me to also. My job said after 90 days you can start WFH and my gf keeps asking when I plan to but I havent told her that I just dont care to. Plus theres a lot of benefits to me going into the office :\n\n1) Super short commute makes it manageable \n\n2) We have 4 break rooms with unlimited snacks and coffee\n\n3) A lot of social events with free food and occasionally alcohol \n\n4) Working downtown means I can walk around on my lunch break, find somewhere to read a book, or grab lunch from a restaurant (our apartment is in the middle of bumfuck nowhere) \n\n5) More privacy! At our current place we share the spare room as an office / gaming room, but at work I have my own office with a door and its way more private and quiet than being at home\n\nAITAH for deliberately opting to go into the office for the reasons above?

Your reasons for wanting to work from the office make sense. You need to just rip the band-aid off and tell her that you are going to primarily work in the office. If you keep dragging this out then eventually it is going to become a situation where you are lying to her or purposefully being deceptive. \n\nYou don't need to give her EVERY reason for why you prefer the office. Just focus on the reasons that have to do with you - it is easier for you to focus at the office and you feel like you can have better work/life balance if your work location is physically separate from your home space.", "NTA Just go into work and don't say anything.

You don't have to go into all the specifics if you feel she may become sensitive about it or perceive it as a slight against her.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. These are all extremely valid reasons for wanting to go into work.

You've decided to work in office because your home life can be distracting. Totally reasonable.", "NTA, for all the reasons you listed, and remember absence makes the heart grow fonder.", "Nta cant blame you also if shes smoking weed all day i think you might want to smell test your clothes cos it clings to them.", "NTA. WFH doesn't work out for everyone. Its a nice option for you but you are under no obligation to do it.", "NTA. Just tell her you need the change to avoid the sitting/eating/gaming  problem which is physically something you want to avoid - sitting the long isn't healthy and as someone who WFH but used to work in office through 30 years of my career, I definitely suffered weight gain/bad back from sitting too much while WFH", "NAH at this moment but YWBTA if you continued to avoid the topic and keep this a secret instead of having a conversation like adults. \n\nif you\u2019re scared to tell her, dig into that. are you afraid she\u2019ll hurt you or herself? are you afraid that you\u2019ll realize you don\u2019t want to be with her? or that she\u2019ll leave you if you don\u2019t WFH? only you know the answers to that.", "NAH, if anything very slight Y T A for not telling her yet.

Sometimes, the time you spend together will be of higher quality if it's less frequent.
