Your reasons for wanting to work from the office make sense. You need to just rip the band-aid off and tell her that you are going to primarily work in the office. If you keep dragging this out then eventually it is going to become a situation where you are lying to her or purposefully being deceptive. \n\nYou don't need to give her EVERY reason for why you prefer the office. Just focus on the reasons that have to do with you - it is easier for you to focus at the office and you feel like you can have better work/life balance if your work location is physically separate from your home space.", "NTA Just go into work and don't say anything. If she asks you can say you have the option to work from home but you are more productive in the office and you want to show how valuable you are to the company to move up.", "NTA. When she asks again, just tell her you feel more productive at the office. You don't have to go into all the specifics if you feel she may become sensitive about it or perceive it as a slight against her.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. These are all extremely valid reasons for wanting to go into work. I don\u2019t see how any reasonable person would have a problem with this.", "NTA - title of your post was a bit misleading but all your reasons are valid.", "NTA dude, nothing wrong with healthy boundaries and space", "NTA. You've decided to work in office because your home life can be distracting. Totally reasonable.", "NTA, for all the reasons you listed, and remember absence makes the heart grow fonder.", "Nta cant blame you also if shes smoking weed all day i think you might want to smell test your clothes cos it clings to them.", "NTA. WFH doesn't work out for everyone. Its a nice option for you but you are under no obligation to do it.", "NTA. Just tell her you need the change to avoid the sitting/eating/gaming  problem which is physically something you want to avoid - sitting the long isn't healthy and as someone who WFH but used to work in office through 30 years of my career, I definitely suffered weight gain/bad back from sitting too much while WFH", "NAH at this moment but YWBTA if you continued to avoid the topic and keep this a secret instead of having a conversation like adults. \n\nif you\u2019re scared to tell her, dig into that. are you afraid she\u2019ll hurt you or herself? are you afraid that you\u2019ll realize you don\u2019t want to be with her? or that she\u2019ll leave you if you don\u2019t WFH? only you know the answers to that.", "NAH, if anything very slight Y T A for not telling her yet. She is looking forward to spending more time around you. You (understandibly) choose to work from the office.

Sometimes, the time you spend together will be of higher quality if it's less frequent. Now that it's possible to spend 99% of your waking hours with one person, people are discovering that might be too much. For different couples, there are different ideal amounts. Some might like 90%.
