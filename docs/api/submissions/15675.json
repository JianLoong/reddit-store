{"id": 15675, "submission_id": "12ywdoa", "title": "AITA for not sharing my late son's life insurance with his girlfriend?", "selftext": "My son Eric passed away in an accident in October of last year. He was 33. \n\nHe wasn't married, but he lived with his girlfriend (Emily) of only 2 years, she just turned 30. They purchased their home together in June of last year. The house was $525k and they put down $225k. They each paid half of the down payment and had been splitting the mortgage equally (as well as all of the rest of their bills). She makes about $80k per year after taxs. The house mortgage is $1775 per month.\n\nMy son has a life insurance policy that paid out $750k. About 6 months before he passed, my son mentioned that he was \"thinking about proposing\" but it would be a few years before we actually married, in a later conversation he mentioned plans to update his life insurance because he wouldn't want to leave a wife with nothing. That's all that was ever said about it - obviously he passed before he ever decided to propose. This means the entire life insurance went to me and my wife. \n\nMy wife and I are both in our late 50's. We usually do okay financially but losing our son has completely shaken our worlds and we've been taking some time off of work to process and grieve. This money will allow us to pay off the rest of our mortgage, take stress off of our lives while we grieve, and hopefully retire a couple years earlier than we intended (we both have medical struggles so this is a big deal). \n\nOur other son, Mike, came over for dinner yesterday and we mentioned that we received his life insurance payout. He went quiet for a minute and asked how much we're going to give Emily. We explained that we have good intentions to use the money to make our lives easier going forward - this is why our son left it to us, to help out should anything tragic happen. Later way after he left, Mike said he understands that we're grieving but we're selfish and narcissistic for not considering how tough this is for Emily and not even helping her by giving her enough to pay off his share of the house (if not the whole mortgage. He said we're kidding ourselves if we think Eric would have wanted this. \n\nI've tried to keep emotions out of it and stick to the facts. All of us - my wife, son, rest of the family, and Emily - are absolutely devastated by Eric's passing. I don't want people to think I'm heartless. \n\nTl;dr: My late son left his life insurance to my wife and I and I'm not sure if we're being assholes by not letting his girlfriend have some of it to help with expenses.\n\nEdit: just for clarification - the house they bought was expensive but they paid more for the view (shitty house on a gorgeous river) than the property. My spn rented it for 3-4 years before it was put up for sale, and after 1.5 years of memories in it together they couldn't walk when it went up for sale. The house itself is outdated and far from a dream home for either of them. They had plans to build a new one when they eventually paid off the mortgage and just planned to make do in the meantime.", "created_utc": 1682457437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ywdoa/aita_for_not_sharing_my_late_sons_life_insurance/", "score": 2260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He had clearly reached the point with his girlfriend where his finances were comingled with her and where they intended to support each other long term, as evidenced by the fact they bought a house together, and he would obviously have wanted his insurance payout to go to her (at least in part) the same way his income did.

They may not have been married but they were committed enough to each other to buy a house together. You're following the letter of your son's wishes but not the spirit.\n\nLooking at the numbers, $1775/mo is 38% of her income, which is more than the official definition of rent burdened (30%). If you gave her 1/3 (one part for you, one part for your wife, one part for the girlfriend), you'd still be getting a lot out of it and she would be, too. Easing the burden of your medical struggles is worthwhile, but I wouldn't make the same choice. So I gotta vote YTA.", "YTA. It's clear steps were being taken by your son to protect Emily.

He just didn't know he'd be taken from her too soon to implement those plans.", "wow YTA.  you should be using the money to pay off his portion of the house, at the very least.  that isn't your money.  none of it should be considered yours.  our children are not supposed to die before us and leave us money.  he didn't leave it to you - that was for his future heirs, whether that be a wife or kids or both.  he didn't have a terminal illness, he didn't plan to pass away when he did, so that money was never intended to go to you, like you think it was: \"this is why our son left it to us, to help out should anything tragic happen\" - that statement is just gross.  honor his wishes and put the money where HE intended it to go.    \n\n\nthat being said, i'm very sorry for your loss.  we shouldn't have to bury our kids.", "YTA  \n\n\nyour son dies and all you can be concenred about is taking advantage of the life insurance policy that he speciffically wanted to change to help out the woman he intended to marry, and you?  \n\n\n  \njust want to make your life better at the expense of hers?  \n\n\nsounds like instead of grieving you are celebrating  that he never got the chance to update the policy, you should feel ashamed, but then again if you were someone to feel ashamed at this you never would have done so in the first place", ">About 6 months before he passed, my son mentioned that he was \"thinking about proposing\" but it would be a few years before we actually married, in a later conversation he mentioned plans to update his life insurance because he wouldn't want to leave a wife with nothing.

He told you to your face. You're being deliberately obtuse about this. \n\nYou know what he wanted and that was to marry Emily and to leave her the life insurance.

Doesn't that just feel icky to you?", "YTA Mike is right.

As someone with a similar income and similar mortgage payment, it\u2019s a lot. That money could easily pay off the house and then some. At the VERY LEAST you should be giving her enough to cover his half of the mortgage (in a lump sum, not over time). She also was probably counting on his income for other finances as well since they were living and owning a home together.

He was 33. \n\nHe wasn't married, but he lived with his girlfriend (Emily) of only 2 years, she just turned 30. They purchased their home together in June of last year. The house was $525k and they put down $225k. They each paid half of the down payment and had been splitting the mortgage equally (as well as all of the rest of their bills). She makes about $80k per year after taxs. The house mortgage is $1775 per month.\n\nMy son has a life insurance policy that paid out $750k. About 6 months before he passed, my son mentioned that he was \"thinking about proposing\" but it would be a few years before we actually married, in a later conversation he mentioned plans to update his life insurance because he wouldn't want to leave a wife with nothing. That's all that was ever said about it - obviously he passed before he ever decided to propose. This means the entire life insurance went to me and my wife. \n\nMy wife and I are both in our late 50's. We usually do okay financially but losing our son has completely shaken our worlds and we've been taking some time off of work to process and grieve. This money will allow us to pay off the rest of our mortgage, take stress off of our lives while we grieve, and hopefully retire a couple years earlier than we intended (we both have medical struggles so this is a big deal). \n\nOur other son, Mike, came over for dinner today and we mentioned that we received his life insurance payout. He went quiet for a minute and asked how much we're going to give Emily. We explained that we have good intentions to use the money to make our lives easier going forward - this is why our son left it to us, to help out should anything tragic happen. Later way after he left, Mike said he understands that we're grieving but we're selfish and narcissistic for not considering how tough this is for Emily and not even helping her by giving her enough to pay off his share of the house (if not the whole mortgage. He said we're kidding ourselves if we think Eric would have wanted this. \n\nI've tried to keep emotions out of it and stick to the facts. All of us - my wife, son, rest of the family, and Emily - are absolutely devastated by Eric's passing. I don't want people to think I'm heartless. \n\nTl;dr: My late son left his life insurance to my wife and I and I'm not sure if we're being assholes by not letting his girlfriend have some of it to help with expenses.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019m mad reading this holy hell", "YTA. Everyone has pretty much covered the bases here, but I want to share an experience. My dad died when I was 12 and before he died (he was sick for a while beforehand) my grandmother changed the beneficiaries of their policy on him to them instead of my mother. They hadn\u2019t taken one out on at that point themselves because my grandparents are very well off and wanted to take care of them that way.  Now my grandparents did this with good intentions (they set the money aside and split it to buy my sister and me our first homes), but it still caused tension in our family. They didn\u2019t tell my mother what they did beforehand, it was a surprise to her after the trauma of his death. She had a good job and they\u2019d been able to save well, especially considering their ages at the time, so ultimately we were okay without the life insurance payout. I don\u2019t know if that would have remained true or not if we continued to live with a single mother. But she remarried after about a year so we have no way to know what our financial situation would have been if she hadn\u2019t. The point is, we were lucky enough at the time to live comfortably with or without the life insurance. But though my grandma had good intentions, what she did still felt like a betrayal to my mother in a lot of ways. It made her feel like she wasn\u2019t trusted, or they thought she\u2019d use the money for herself, or like they thought they had to go behind her back, or any other number of things.  Who knows, maybe she had plans for the money at the time that we never knew about. Idk but when I look back on my life that feels like a turning point. There were a few things that happened after my dads death and before my moms second marriage that definitely strained their relationship (mostly at the hands of my grandma but that\u2019s a whole other can of worms), but the insurance thing feels like the starting point of the end of their relationship. They can barely be in a room together anymore, but we\u2019re just thankful it\u2019s civil now (again, lack of civility is mostly on grandmas part). \n\nAll this to say, things like this irreparably change families, I know that by personal experience. And what happened in my family was so, so, so much better than what you\u2019ve done to your family. Because like it or not, your son considered his partner his family and intended to marry her very soon, so she should be family to you too. And you\u2019re just fucking her over when she\u2019s already experiencing the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to her.  \n\nPlease reconsider your actions.

Makes my skin crawl. My goodness gracious.", "You\u2019re doing gods work by continuing to post this comment. Is your name Mike by chance?", "I guarantee he will, as he should. I cannot believe these parents can be so callous. It would be one thing if it were 100k and not enough to pay off anyone's house, but this is a huge amount of money! Not wanting to share 750k is just obscenely greedy.", "For real, how can ppl get so money crazed through grief ??\n\n We lost my aunt to suicide very unexpectedly in 2020. No will, no note. My aunt was a single woman in her 50s. Never married. No kids. She had put my mom as her beneficiary a few years back, despite my grandfather (their father) being still alive.\n\nWe had to sell her apartments, pay some her debt back, and then my mom was left with a good chunk of money. This money was literally the last thing on our minds - it felt sad, abnormal and almost dirty. She busted her ass her whole life from age 18 to earn her money and buy property and nice things for herself. And then, she was gone. And we had to do something with all her hard earned money ? This felt like squandering her whole life away. \n\nEven thinking about it was taboo for a while. Took us time to acknowledge it and reach a decision about how to use it. It was a really difficult time. My grandpa still can't think about this money without crying.\n\nIn the end, we bought a vacation house with it because that's the kind of project she had and she would have loved. This is still extremely bittersweet to have this privilege, this house, knowing that the price was my aunt's death.", "Yeah, legally OP can keep the money. But he\u2019s still a major selfish AH for it.\n\nEdit: technically speaking, a mortgage is a debt to a bank. The gf legally has inherited the remaining debt on the house. So while the beneficiaries in a will or estate do not inherit his debt, a debt was still inherited upon his death. \n\nBut sure, his debt wasn\u2019t inherited by his parents so they don\u2019t have to worry about it and can run off into the sunset and retire early just like they always planned.", "Buuuurn!\nNice one, they fuckin\u2019 deserve any shit coming their way.", "\\*puts on reddit detective hat\\*\n\nOr OP killed son before he could change the life insurance so they could claim it all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe all my wifes true crime podcasts are starting to insinuate themselves into my brain.", "Read the comment that was linked. Basically, OP and his wife looked into how the property was titled because they weren't sure if their son's portion of the property belonged to them.

On my policy I can even designate percentages to each person.", "You can divie it up with stated percentages. There also also contingent benes, in case the main recipient dies before the insured.

I bet the other son is re-evaluating their finances, life insurance policy, etc. My boyfriend & I don\u2019t plan on getting married, but we are each others POA when it comes to medical stuff & we have both mentioned when we get life insurance policies to make each other the beneficiary. My heart goes out to the GF, she must be going through a hell of a time right now.", "In a perfect world, they wouldn't have that money, so losing their son (as unfortunate as it is) shouldn't affect them financially. They haven't lost funds on anything, so they've had a windfall of three quarters of a million dollars as recompense for that sad fact. I don't know if it's grief or just his really shitty PA way of trying to block Emily from being part of the family, because I have a really uncomfy feeling that even if he HAD proposed and they were engaged, he'd justify it with 'they weren't married yet'. \n\nI'm really just hanging on the fact that the brother sees what a crap thing it is to do and is calling them out on it. Emily is the one that's going to not only be swimming in grief, but in debt as well with the financial obligations of pulling off a mortgage on her own. One that by the sounds of it, Daddy didn't approve of either. So this is just some really backhanded PA way of punishing her for something he has no right to punish her for and putting her in a worse place then she needs to be right now. \n\nThe worst part is that he's not even going to lose any sleep over it.", "I feel like OP was like, \"Welp, she's not technically the wife, so the increase in policy was clearly for us\" \ud83d\udc80", "Then notice how he edits to say the house isn't very nice etc etc.....\n\nOP YTA big-time.", "I\u2019m in Canada and we have life insurance for the amount of our mortgage - just seemed like the sensible thing to do.", "More like GreedyDad666", "Did they really", "If I were the other child, I don\u2019t know how I could be in any kind of regular contact with my parents after this.  I\u2019m going to guess this isn\u2019t the first incident of such behavior, but I really hope it\u2019s the worst.  Definitely a \u201cwhen people show you who they are, believe it\u201d moment for their surviving son, who has my deepest sympathies.  It sounds like he lost the only family he had worth having.  I hope he and Emily can keep in touch and support each other.", "With the caveat that they should work with a financial adviser or lawyer on the best way to handle it, because gift tax kicks in much sooner than estate tax.", "I just want to point out, unless I missed what you mean, that $375k is 1/2 of the life insurance money. $75k is only 10%.", "Even if he wanted to leave some $ to his parents it would probably have been a small % 80/20 if we\u2019re generous and these greedy AH know that!", "Seriously if they split it they with Emily the parents would be much better off than they were before son died and Emily wouldn\u2019t be struggling as much.  \n\nOP would still be the AH because he knows that money is not meant for him, and is taking ALL of it", "If I could up vote this a million times I would.

And yes, mortgage insurance is different than life, when my dad died the mortgage got paid in full by mortgage insurance. If she had it the mortgage could already be paid in full."]}
