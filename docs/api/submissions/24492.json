Or it was a doorbell camera. \n\nYou are taking this way too far.\n\nEdit - OP confirmed it was an outdoor camera", "This is a great example of why air bnbs are such a bad idea. Who wants to pay to stay at a place where you'll be recorded and watched around the clock by the owner? That sounds more like a stint in prison rather than a weekend getaway. \n\nNTA. This guy sounds over-the-top intrusive and his tacking on a surprise \"party fee\" for *$500* to the bill is ludicrous.", "Air bnb are a waste and take housing opportunities in neighborhoods. They used to be a novelty when they was cheap alternative to hotels but know it\u2019s fees fees fees for every single thing and most are shit holes run by wannabe slum lords", "ESH. \n\nTechnically, having guests over is against the rules for almost every single AirBnB listing. I\u2019m not sure if he stated it explicitly on the listing, but that standard is essentially expected. Similarly, almost every listing will say that there are security cameras in outdoor spaces. \n\nHowever, he also had no reason to make a big deal about it, from what you said. If he got a complaint, then he certainly does. \n\nThe review was probably too harsh. He\u2019s not spying on you for looking at his outdoor security cameras. That what security cameras are for. He wasn\u2019t \u201cwatching\u201d you grilling and eating, he looked at the camera and saw 7 people when he rented to 2. \n\nNone of this warranted the scene he made about it nor the nuclear option you took. This could have been handled like adults, so you\u2019re all assholes. Respectfully.", "For clarity: you booked the AirBnB for 2 guests, ended up with 5 people total eating a calm dinner on one night, which included a 7 year old. Was there a guest limit on the listing that you went over?\n\nWithout knowing the official AirBnB etiquette, this feels like an egregious overreaction from the owner. Camera in the unit to watch you that you didn\u2019t know about? Random $500 \u201cfine\u201d assesses on nothing but the owners sense of principal? Drop the payload on that guy. 1 star review, and a lengthy explanation of his spying. I would do everything I can to discourage anyone renting his listing again. \n\nNTA based on this context. Soft ESH IF you violated a clear rule on the listing. Even in that case, secret filming of your family and the egregious fine are absolutely nonsensical.", "Info, what is the layout of this place, and how many people did you say were staying there?  \n\nIf this is like a 1 BR place, and you said there would be 2 people there, having 3 others is... questionable. \n\nI guess there is a weird line between where you would and wouldn't consider it a party.  You know that this is the other family you are visiting (I assume anyway), but they don't know that.  They just see twice the number of people who rented it.  \n\nAlso, I'd hardly call having cameras outside in the yard \"creepy\" or spying.   \n\nI think this could've been a calm conversation that you guys escalated.  It could've been \"this isn't a party, just my family that we are in town visiting\".  Instead you \"had words\", which I'm guessing it was probably pretty aggressive, and called them a creeper.", "NTA, even though airbnbs, hotels, leases, etc., might have occupancy limits, and require you to notify them if they're changing, it's absurd to have a guest limit like that. Yeah, the 'no parties' rule makes some sense if they're worried about noise complaints or property damage, but this is just bizarre. If I'm at a hotel or an airbnb and invite a couple of friends over for a few hours, I don't expect to get someone freaking out because I had a few guests, unless there was some specifically listed rule that was made clear to begin with, and that I agreed to up-front. \n\nI also understand that people have doorbell cameras and security cameras as a safety protocol, but I can't fault you for feeling a little skeeved out if you weren't informed about them in advance.", ">he\u2019s sent us emails trying to explain his situation and we are putting him out of income\n\nOh dear god, I'm crying.\n\nNTA.", "> he\u2019s sent us emails trying to explain his situation and we are putting him out of income.\n\nHis fault and deserved.

I think you did the rest of the renting world a favor.", "ESH\n\nBut at the same time \u2026 justified. Air BNB is just full of the creepiest people who want money but obviously also hate the idea of people being in their houses.", "NTA. That is what reviews are for. He spied and you left him with a bad review. Well deserved on his part", "NTA - It wasn\u2019t a party. I mean, he was recording a minor. So I don\u2019t even think the police report was too much. Sounds like he wanted to scam you for the fee and when you didn\u2019t cave to avoid the headache it backfired on him. Sounds like he didn\u2019t like the find out portion\u2026", "NTA, he effectively tried to steal money from you, what you describe is a meal with family, not a party.  \n\n\nOne of the problems with AirBnB and the others is that the people you're dealing with have zero sense of customer oriented mindset or of market economics.  They're going to do what seems best for themselves in the moment, rather than of thinking of the bigger picture and how their actions today can hurt their business tomorrow.  My wife and I have done basically what you describe and we made sure to tell the host what we planned before actually reserving the property.  That way, if they say no then we go elsewhere and if they say yes, there's a paper trail if they try to backtrack.  Maybe try that in the future?", "YTA. You come across as super abrasive. When you reserve an Airbnb you specify how many people will ne saying. Would have been easy to shoot a quick message about possibilities for hosting a dinner before booking. Of course the host shouldn\u2019t be filming you, but do you even know that\u2019s what happened? Maybe the host has neighbours keep an eye out for anything suspicious.", "NTA. It was not a party. I am unsure how he knee abt it though, maybe some whistleblowers. But if he did eatch you guys then thats creepy. You were harsh, but fair, and the 1 star rating was just honest, and good for potential other guests.", "NTA.\n\nIf you were truthful, why worry?  Block him and move on.", "Block him. You owe him nothing. And it's good that you gave the review. NTA.", "YTA. Yeah\u2026you were in the wrong here from start to finish. Unless the Airbnb listing says it\u2019s acceptable to have guests who aren\u2019t registered, you need to ask permission. He has every right to monitor who comes in and out of his home, and has to do so to make sure if guests are respecting the rules of the property. You were a shitty guest and now you\u2019re trying to tank his business over it. Stop.", "NTA. He invaded your privacy. A landlord can own an apartment complex but has no right to spy on their tenants. I don\u2019t see how this changes with an air bnb.

What is the grill for if not to cook dinner for a small group of people?", "Screw other people. How very 21st Century of you. I\u2019ve now met part of the problem.", "I don\u2019t know what you want to argue with, it is objectively true. Feel free to call Airbnb customer support if you want to confirm it? You register for the Airbnb with the number of guests who are staying and it\u2019s up to the host if they allow visitors beyond that. You are paying for use of the house for the number of guests you registered and any visitors the host approves.", "A lot of AirBNB people use cameras. It makes it easier to prove when damage is done. If it was a motion censored one, he may not of been spying. He may of got a notification, saw more people than agreed and messaged you.", "Does the listing include info about the camera? If it\u2019s omitted, I can see being a little upset. But you sound nuclear.", "I mean, i feel for people with shitty neighbors but shouldn\u2019t they just deal with that? \n\nMake noise complaints. Call the police.", "I\u2019ve looked it up. Hosts are instructed to make their rules clear to potential tenants. They can deny guests, but they cannot retroactively invent a no guest policy to justify a $500 charge.", "They\u2019re encouraged to do so to avoid misunderstandings, but \u2018no unregistered guests\u2019 is still the default. Also, OP has studiously avoided questions about whether the cameras and no guests rules were on the listings. At minimum, it definitely said \u2018no parties\u2019 which is enough that OP should have known to clarify what that meant. There is very little chance Airbnb or anyone is going to side with him on this. IF the listing didn\u2019t disclose the cameras, the host will need to fix that going forward. Everything else is on OP here."]}
