You aren't \"babysitting\" your own kid when your wife needs a break. You are just taking on your share of raising your kid. \n\nYou are an adult. It's your house too. You know what needs to be done around the house. You don't need your wife to make you a list of what to do. That's asking her to do the mental work of managing you, in addition to everything else she does. You have eyes. You can see if the trash is full and needs to be taken out, the sink is full of dirty dishes to put in the dishwasher, the dishwasher needs to be emptied, or the floors cleaned. Look for when those things need to be done and JUST do them, and look for other things you can do around the house (watch the other things your wife cleans to see what is important to her and do those things for extra credit!).", "NTA. \n\n She was being unreasonable and hypocritical by expecting you to do everything yourself and not contribute anything.

Don't retaliate and don't hold something as critical as money over the other.", "NTA\n\nIf you are not being asked to do more chores, she should be paying some of the bills.

I do agree you need to help your wife with chores, but this list sounds like way too many chores!!\n\nI can get down with your Monday and Tuesday chores, those are reasonable to do weekly, though I think you can spread them out more throughout the week vs just those 2 days. \n\nWhere it starts to get to be a bit much are the Wednesday, Thursday, Friday chores. Those are all monthly chores (except possibly block the shop, I don't know what that is). Like what are you doing to your fridge and oven that they need to be cleaned weekly?? \n\nAnyway, the most equitable chore balance I have seen is, for both of you to be roughly equal in your sum total of work hours + chore hours. If you work more hours, she can spend more hours doing chores, though if she's pregnant, maybe give her the lighter ones that are more time consuming. Folding laundry comes to mind. \n\nThat way, you'll both have the same amount of leisure time. It is also nice to plan to do chores together when you can. Like doing different chores but at the same time, is more fun than just being home alone and doing chores by yourself imo.", "NTA, she either goes full traditional and takes care of the house or you start dividing everything equally, she can't expect to receive the benefits of an equal relationship without putting her part", "NTA - I can\u2019t deal with these old school relationships.

I did go and knock out most of list today since it\u2019s my day off and none of the list takes very long", "Right now she's working part time and only bringing in 30% so yeah she should be doing a lot more of the chores. As a woman myself her list is ridiculous for the bloke who works full time. \n\nAlso is it just me or is AITA full of couples who got married and had kids really darn young?!?!", "How does his argument not hold up?\n\nHis wife wanted a \"traditional\" marriage. Well guess what, the unfortunate reality of the modern world is that one median income really isn't enough to afford the traditional american dream of a home, a spouse, and kids. If OP is expected to shoulder that responsibility solo, then why shouldn't OP's partner be expected to manage the domestic situation, which is literally the arrangement she requested?\n\nAnd why does OP's wife even need a new car if she doesn't work? When did cars go from being necessary modes of transportation in certain regions to being something someone feels entitled to?\n\nAnd look at the list of chores. So on Monday OP is supposed to work their full time job, but then find time to also break down a bunch of old boxes, clean the yard, and clean the \"side tables in the bedroom\" whatever the fuck that means.\n\nNBD on Weds, at least. I mean, all OP needs to do is clean the fridge for a couple hours, then clean the oven for a couple hours, then clean the pool for a couple hours! If he starts right when he gets home he might be done by midnight!\n\nOP's partner is nuts for this. Expecting the person working full time paying the bills to spend all their free time on domestic tasks is a little insane when you literally demanded to be a housewife(or houseperson, whatever).\n\nas a side note, not to attack OP but like, if OP's partner is managing to make 30% of their household income by working part time at Starbucks, then quite honestly it doesn't sound like they can realistically get by on one income. They should really both be working full time. And OP's wife getting to work part time at star bucks IN ORDER TO BUY A NEW CAR is not the same thing as OP working full time in order to put food on the table.

What happens to the eggs?\n\nIf she's doing all the cooking and working part time, I think asking you to do the heavy lifting while she's pregnant is reasonable.

It turns out she was pregnant, but I think she should've started with that and asked for more help around the house with tasks that she couldn't do anymore, instead of asking for some help and then throwing that list at him. I'd have reacted the same way honestly, but I'll admit, I'm petty. My husband is aware of this as well, and when I was a sahw, I took care of all the domestic tasks.
