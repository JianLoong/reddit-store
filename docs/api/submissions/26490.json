During the preparation for our wedding, my mom got diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. She went through multiple surgeries in the past few months, removing her tumor cells. The doctor mentioned that she\u2019ll be getting chemo for rest of her life. \n\nMy dad lives overseas for work and did not come back to the country due to mom\u2019s wishes on having stable income during her treatment. That means, while she\u2019s going to her appointments and getting chemo, I\u2019m getting no support from the family while I\u2019m working full time to support the wedding cost. My brother (36M) lives about an hr and half away and he shows up once in awhile. My fianc\u00e9 comes to every single appointment to show support, but I\u2019m still the only one who can take her to appointments. \n\nWhile preparing the wedding we already paid for, my mom suddenly asked me if my fianc\u00e9 and I could move in with her after we get married. My mom is difficult to live with (she always needs to keep the house tidy and free of clutter), so I don\u2019t want to force my fianc\u00e9 to move in with her. Also, the house is not big enough for all 3 of us. She tells me that she wants to live my life and move out, but at the same time she\u2019s scared of chemo and she wants me around the house, in case of emergencies.

Help her through this period and work on alternative plans for the future. I understand that your dad is at an age where it's difficult to find work. Can she move to him? Can your brother commit to frequent visits? Have you spoken to a social worker about a home health aide or attendant? Can she or you or your brother move closer? Can you spend the night with her the days she has chemo (when she'll presumably be feeling the worst)? Can you have a blunt conversation with your father and brother about how to care for your mother when you can't? This shouldn't all fall on you.", "YTA\u2026. ALREADY LIVED THROUGH THIS SITUATION!

So my advice is purely for the sake of your own future self here. It doesn\u2019t mean she should live with you, but maybe have a think about what you would be willing to do and if there are other things you might want to try doing that would help (while preserving your own sanity.)", "YTA if you let your mom go through all this alone because she likes things neat.
