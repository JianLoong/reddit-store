Speaking from experience, being single is substantially better than being in a relationship where you feel alone. If you do breakup, it sucks and it's not an instant relief necessarily so don't think fi you split that you struggling emotionally is because you were meant to be with him. Relationships that drain you can make it hard after because you're so depleted emotionally, but it won't get better if you stay. \n\nDon't buy into sunk cost fallacy or focus on the good times when he can't give you basic understanding.
