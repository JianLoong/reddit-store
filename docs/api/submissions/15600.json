Her oldest is a girl. When expecting their daughter my sister and BIL did not agree on names and ultimately compromised on her giving the first name and him giving the middle name. So my niece is Margaret first name and her middle name is something more uncommon like River.\n\nMy niece does not like her first name and uses her middle name. My sister hates it. She has told my niece the middle name is not her name, her name is Margaret and she could go by Maggie, Meg, Mag, Maisie or something related to her name, but it's silly to go by her middle name which stands out so much. My niece said doesn't like those nicknames, that she doesn't want a name that my sister sees as normal. BIL calls her by the middle name. So do my nephews (her younger brothers) and so does the rest of the family. My sister and one or two teachers, are the only ones who refuse to call her by the middle name. My sister has raged at everyone for using her middle name. She has told her daughter she is no longer allowed to introduce herself under something not Margaret or a nickname that makes sense from it. My niece told her she can't decide what she calls herself. My sister told her she is her mother and she is sick and tired of her dismissing her name. My niece said it was a horrible name, she hated it, that my sister had terrible taste in names and she won't ever go by Margaret again.\n\nOn top of this my sister is giving her husband such a hard time over the name. She said he should never have given her such a stupid middle name. Why couldn't he have given her the middle name Mary or Elizabeth or Marie. He told her they are boring names and since she gave her a boring old lady name, he wanted to give her something more fun and young and could be good if she didn't want a boring name. She called him an asshole. She told him he did not get to name all their kids (she let him name the boys because she felt he would know better than her about what boys would like) and I think she hates their names, so the fact her daughter hates the name she actually loves is driving her crazy. All my sister seems to do now is pick a fight with her husband.\n\nA few days ago we were all at our brother's house and she was telling my niece she was being difficult and she was fighting with her husband over him calling their daughter by her middle name and because he had bought her a keyring with the middle name on it. She glared at me when BIL said that my husband and I were lucky that we had been on the same page with our kids names. She told me I should not look so happy that she's being disrespected. I told her to get over herself and she'll lose her husband and her daughter if she continues the way she is, because she is being unbearable. She told me I should be on her side and it's \"such a cruel thing to say\".
