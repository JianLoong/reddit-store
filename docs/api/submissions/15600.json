Her oldest is a girl. When expecting their daughter my sister and BIL did not agree on names and ultimately compromised on her giving the first name and him giving the middle name. So my niece is Margaret first name and her middle name is something more uncommon like River.\n\nMy niece does not like her first name and uses her middle name. My sister hates it. She has told my niece the middle name is not her name, her name is Margaret and she could go by Maggie, Meg, Mag, Maisie or something related to her name, but it's silly to go by her middle name which stands out so much. My niece said doesn't like those nicknames, that she doesn't want a name that my sister sees as normal. BIL calls her by the middle name. So do my nephews (her younger brothers) and so does the rest of the family. My sister and one or two teachers, are the only ones who refuse to call her by the middle name. My sister has raged at everyone for using her middle name. She has told her daughter she is no longer allowed to introduce herself under something not Margaret or a nickname that makes sense from it. My niece told her she can't decide what she calls herself. My sister told her she is her mother and she is sick and tired of her dismissing her name. My niece said it was a horrible name, she hated it, that my sister had terrible taste in names and she won't ever go by Margaret again.\n\nOn top of this my sister is giving her husband such a hard time over the name. She said he should never have given her such a stupid middle name. Why couldn't he have given her the middle name Mary or Elizabeth or Marie. He told her they are boring names and since she gave her a boring old lady name, he wanted to give her something more fun and young and could be good if she didn't want a boring name. She called him an asshole. She told him he did not get to name all their kids (she let him name the boys because she felt he would know better than her about what boys would like) and I think she hates their names, so the fact her daughter hates the name she actually loves is driving her crazy. All my sister seems to do now is pick a fight with her husband.\n\nA few days ago we were all at our brother's house and she was telling my niece she was being difficult and she was fighting with her husband over him calling their daughter by her middle name and because he had bought her a keyring with the middle name on it. She glared at me when BIL said that my husband and I were lucky that we had been on the same page with our kids names. She told me I should not look so happy that she's being disrespected. I told her to get over herself and she'll lose her husband and her daughter if she continues the way she is, because she is being unbearable. She told me I should be on her side and it's \"such a cruel thing to say\".

If she doesn't address her daughter by the preferred name, her kid will cut her off one day and will most likely be changing her name when she reaches adulthood. This is her daughter's identity. It's not about what your sister likes.", "NTA and you're right about her losing her daughter at the very least.", "NTA. Your sis needs to chill. Also Margaret is a very boring name.

It should serve as a wake-up call for your sister, because it is the truth. She making her relationships with husband and daughter miserable over a very silly issue. Lots of kids decide at a certain age to go by a middle name or a nick name. This is not a hill to die on for your sister. If this becomes the major content of her interactions with them her husband is going to leave and her daughter withdraw from her. You did her a favor.

She's making other people's names about herself entirely. It's controlling and weird.", "NTA. You told your sis nothing but the unvarnished truth.

You're doing an amazing thing by accepting your nibling by their requested name. This is an important thing for anyone, whether straight/gay/trans/cis. Allowing kids to have a say in their identity is a great thing. When I was a kid I established very early that I didn't like my full first name (a very Irish catholic name) and wanted to go by a nickname of that name. This was accepted by the majority of people but I have had the odd person call me by my government name, even as an adult. And I will straight up tell them, \" The ONLY person who calls me *Full First Name* is my mother. And only when I'm in trouble.\" please stand by your nibling as they are finding their identity. And you're right, your sister is absolutely going to lose her family if she continues. NTA.", "I don't see how you can be TA here for speaking the truth. Your sister needs therapy or she is going to end up alone.", "INFO: How old is Margaret?", "NTA but I think *both* parents are using their daughter to prove a point. \n\nA father shouldn\u2019t tell their child that their first name is boring and for an old lady. Even if he didn\u2019t ever say those exact words kids listen and pick up on those types of feelings. While I don\u2019t doubt or question her feelings I do think their daughter absolutely understands that going by River makes her dad happy while also upsetting her mother.\n\nA mother shouldn\u2019t forbid their child from using their own name however they like or tell them their name is weird or wrong. They shouldn\u2019t punish their child at all for their choice, let alone so severely.\n\nNo one hears a name and automatically thinks either \u201celderly\u201d or \u201cweird.\u201d Those judgements need to be learned and/or taught.\n\nBoth Margaret and River are fine and fairly common names. Neither is antiquated or unique enough to truly stand out. To have such strong opinions about either says far more about your sister and her husband - and their relationship - then it does about names.", "ESH, but 20:80\n\nSister is an asshole for just about everything here. All the name stuff, the kid stuff, the husband stuff. And for saying you are supposed to be on her side.\n\nIt's good that you spoke up. But your specific points were over the line and make you an asshole.  And more importantly, they ignore the real problem. The child should have autonomy in their name, and for you to support that you have to support THAT.
