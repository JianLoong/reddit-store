He gave several hints including that I needed to not make plans for Christmas Day, how far it was from our house, etc. I knew his mother will be in town and I asked if she was coming with and he stated yes. After many guesses and him going back and forth on whether he wanted to tell me now or wait for Christmas, he gave told me that he had purchased tickets to attend an NFL game. \n\nI grew up in the south and am a big football fan. We have not yet gone to a game together and I have mentioned that I really wanted to go to a game with him several times over the nearly 5 years that we have been together. However, this wasn\u2019t really what I had imagined-going to a football game on Christmas Day with my husband and MIL. He was a little taken aback when I didn\u2019t burst with joy. I shared that while I thought he was very thoughtful and I love that he thought about the things that I love and put so much thought into it, it\u2019s just not really what I had imagined for our first game. He told me that he had a cancellation policy on the tickets and I asked him if I could think about it before making up my mind. However, I was leaning towards wanting him to return the tickets and we can go to a different game at some point later when my MIL is not in town. \n\nNow I\u2019ve been told that I\u2019m a selfish brat, I\u2019m being exclusionary and I\u2019m not being very Christian-like because I wanted to pass on the game with my MIL being in town. I was told that she was excited to go and I\u2019m making her miss out on her first NFL game. It\u2019s been suggested that I don\u2019t like my MIL even though I\u2019m the one who booked her tickets to be here for over a week and never batted an eye at that length of time. I\u2019ve recommended we go on a short trip while she\u2019s out here so she can be somewhere she\u2019s never been, etc. I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind because I thought when my husband gave me a gift, it was with the purpose of giving me something that would make me happy and was what I wanted. When I very gently turned it down after thanking him profusely, it turned into a character attack because I\u2019m not excited about us not being able to share in that experience together without my MIL in tow.\n\nETA: I had mentioned that I wanted to go with him but never specifically said only the two of us because our family doesn\u2019t live here and he is very particular about us both being on board with what our families are involved with in our lives to the point where I feel uneasy about inviting my parents/family at times.\n\nI also didn\u2019t suggest that my MIL be excluded from our plans. I wouldn\u2019t leave our company at home to go out. \n\nBefore telling me the gift, he did tell me he had bought extra insurance if I didn\u2019t like the gift.", "created_utc": 1667367850, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjwsqn/aita_for_turning_down_my_husbands_christmas_gift/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You clearly want this to be a special date experience between the two of you. But I get the feeling you didn\u2019t know that until he gave you the gift and you had a gut reaction of disappointment. There was no way for your husband to know you wanted a special date because you didn\u2019t tell him and there was no way to tell him beforehand because you probably didn\u2019t know until you had the reaction in the first place.\n\nThe best way to handle this is to talk to him and say, this is not an attack on your mom nor is it an attack on you. I did not realize I wanted this to be a special date between the two of us until you told me about the game and that your mom was coming with us. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like your mom, I just realized in the moment you told me that I clearly hadn\u2019t communicated my feelings well mostly because I didn\u2019t know how I felt until faced with the situation. Now I know that deep down, when I said I wanted to go to a game, I meant I wanted a husband and wife date night, with some flirting and maybe some drinking (if that\u2019s your style) and things like that. But I didn\u2019t know until faced with a game with your mother where I will have to keep my hands to myself and watch what I say and pay attention to how I drink and act.

It\u2019s Christmas Day and you are an adult who has an opinion on how you would like to spend the day. That\u2019s totally fair.

They are treating you just awful now, using religion to guilt you and attacking your character because you are acting like a person with opinions and feelings instead of their accessory.", "YTA\u2026.and a party pooper. It\u2019s a nice thoughtful gift that you\u2019ve been wanting for years, yet you turned it down because your MIL is going? It\u2019s a football game!

I can understand the sentimentality on your part but I\u2019m going to go with yeah, YTA. Its not like he\u2019s bringing his mother along with the two of you on a romantic getaway to Bora Bora, it\u2019s just a football game.. *thousands* of people will be there, which is fine.. as long as one of them isn\u2019t MIL?

It\u2019s Christmas, not Valentine\u2019s Day.  Christmas is a family holiday.

You're very much a selfish brat. I hope they go without you. You're acting like a child. Infact, i know children who act better than this. \n\nEveryone knows if you get a gift you don't like, you just accept it and keep your mouth shut, because the other option is that you don't get any gifts. This is something even children understand. Wtf op.", "Just throwing this out there, but dosnt sound like the issue here is the football game at all.\n\nSounds to me like you would have rather gone to the game with him for the first time with your family, but he seems to have some intense feelings arround family and so you don't feel like you can express you want your family to visit more.\n\nYou are seeing this as one more thing he is trying to replace from your past with his future.\n\nThe two of you ever spent the holiday with your family?", "NTS. Boy, they\u2019re bringing out the guilt artillery, aren\u2019t they? It\u2019s a nice family experience but you are not wrong to want something more personal.", "NTA. He got the tickets for his mom and added you on lol", "NTA it's not really a gift but, more of  a family event.  It does make sense that it's a gift for you but not for him.  \nHe planned a family trip and tied it into a gift.  If it involved including others in this gift. It's no longer personal.  My advice.  Get tickets for a game before Christmas for the two of you and then do the family event.", "A very soft YTA. It\u2019s Christmas, and Christmas is a time for spending time with family, especially family that you don\u2019t get to see often. You and your husband have plenty of time to go on dates by yourselves.\n\nAlso, if you really want to your first football game to be just you two (which to me is kinda odd because I never looked at football games as romantic but to each their own), then you can always go to one together before Christmas. But it may cause too much of a scene to cancel the Christmas game now. Can you imaging explaining the reason for cancelling to your family and friends? It can easily be taken the wrong way, and cause you a lot of headache with all the explaining and reasoning you will have to do for everyone.", "ESH\n\nThis is why surprise gifts suck. A gift this expensive should be discussed and agreed before making the purchase. It would have been so much better if he told you in advance his idea...\n\nLeaving that aside, it is weird that he's making you and MIL the same gift. It's also weird that it's on Christmas day. That's a day to sit around the tree and enjoy Christmas dinner with the family (you don't mention kids, but if you have kids, leaving them alone on Christmas is a really shitty move).\n\nOn the other hand, if an NFL game has been your long-time dream, you should have at least appreciated all his effort and be at least a little bit excited. Also cancelling the tickets is incredibly rude.", "Yta- you posted this yesterday. Did you not like the result?", "How many times are you posting this? Until you get the result you want? \ud83d\ude02", "I agree with this.

It\u2019s not like the ticket\u2019s value is lesser because an extra person is tagging along.  I wonder if she told her husband that she specifically wanted their first game together to be just the two of them.  She only says she wanted to go together, which they would be", "Honestly for the same reason I haven\u2019t just bought tickets to go with my husband before this-they\u2019re just not football people. I\u2019m concerned that I won\u2019t be able to fully enjoy the game with people who aren\u2019t very into it. I was hoping at some point my husband would care more about the sport and get into it but that hasn\u2019t happened yet lol. At least in that case it would only be one person not enjoying themselves. Now I feel the responsibility of 2 people\u2019s fun", "I agree with this.  It's a gift, it is up to the giver.  And it's not an entire lifestyle change, it's one outing.  YTA.", "I can see where she\u2019s coming from though\u2026 this is something she wanted. She wanted to do it with her husband. But it kind of seems like it\u2019s a gift for her, him and his mom? Maybe if they were going to bring a group, he should have asked her if she wanted to bring someone from her family too. \n\nTotally reasonable that if they go on Christmas, the family would attend but I can understand how it feels like \u201cher\u201d present isn\u2019t really for her any longer.", "Also NFL game isn't exactly a quiet intimate setting. You're going to be in a crowd of thousands of screaming people, if your MiL is a couple seats over you'll barely even notice if you don't want to.", "It\u2019s not something nice for her anymore, however.", "Well I\u2019ve been to many NFL games, I just have been wanting to go with him as a date for years but he hasn\u2019t taken a particular liking to football in spite of my influence lol.

This is the only post I made.", "What are you talking about?", "But then its not a christmas gift for her, its just a family event.", "The ticket is actually *worthless* because someone\u2019s mother is also going to be there. \n\nThis is about going to a game *together*, not about just going to a game.", "I don\u2019t think you need to pressure yourself into taking responsibility for their fun.  I\u2019m not a sports fan but when I go to a game in person, I\u2019m completely sucked into the energy of the crowd.  It\u2019s a blast.  I can\u2019t imagine staring blankly at the field while everyone around me is cheering.", "It's not your place to regulate what people do based on what they might or might not enjoy. Your husband chose to buy the tickets, your MIL is choosing to go. Whether they regret going or not is on them, not on you.", "So, your husband chose to buy you a gift that is wholly about you and something you\u2019ve wanted for a long while, even though he\u2019s not a huge fan, just so you can be happy? Has he stated he won\u2019t have fun? It sounds like this man is ecstatic to go with you and put a lot of time and thoughtful effort into this gift OP. Idk if I would say y t a, but I might think about how much love he put into this gift for you \u2665\ufe0f", "I can sort of see that perspective, but I still think it\u2019s an over the top reaction from OP to completely reject the tickets.  If the same thing happened to me with my favorite musician\u2019s concert, I\u2019d snatch the ticket, enjoy the evening and tell my bf \u201cbut I\u2019d still like to do this again in the future, just the two of us!\u201d But that\u2019s just me.  It doesn\u2019t sound like she mentioned to him that it was something she wanted to do intimately with him and him alone.  If she did, that might change my judgement.", "It is something nice, also again, you don't throw a fit about gifts.\n\nGift giving has always been something where the thought matters more than the gift.\n\nEven children know to accept and be thankful for gifts even when they don't like them. If i acted how OP is when i was a kid, I'd not have any gifts. \nOP is being a brat and doesn't deserve to get any gifts ever if this is how she acts.", "So, you actively admit it won\u2019t be as fun as a date activity, but you\u2019re acting like a child over the fact that not only did your husband make a heartfelt gesture, but is trying to make it into a fun holiday activity. Just because it isn\u2019t what you envisioned in your mind (which we already know is moot because he doesn\u2019t enjoy football like you do), doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be enjoyable. Heck, it could even become a holiday tradition (not necessarily on Christmas Day itself). Sometimes you have to look on the bright side of things. He made a very nice gesture and you stomped all over it.\n\nIf you never mentioned it being a romantic date type activity (which you could have planned yourself, btw, seeing as you are the one who likes it and wants it to go a super specific way), why would he assume a football stadium filled with thousands of screaming fans would cause a tiff if one more person came along? Unless he planned this for your anniversary or something, I say you should really reassess your attitude about this.", "This exact same post was put up yesterday", "See I disagree. Just because someone else is getting the same gift doesn't make it not a gift.", "It\u2019s a football game, not a romantic candlelit dinner. Unless OP specifically mentioned wanting it just to be the two of them or it was on their anniversary or some other romantically sentimental date, I personally wouldn\u2019t assume a football stadium filled with thousands of spectators was intended to be this super romantic only for us two outing either. OP can be bummed, but honestly I think they\u2019re making too big a deal of it. There\u2019s always another game to go to alone, and quite frankly, if going to a game alone with hubby was such a big deal, OP could have planned this outing themself at some point.", "They\u2019ll still be together.  Unless OP told her husband beforehand that by \u201ctogether\u201d she meant an intimate one on one experience I don\u2019t see how completely rejecting the tickets is the correct response.  I\u2019d never reject tickets to my favorite music group no matter how many randos my bf invited along.  I\u2019d snatch the ticket, enjoy the night, and say \u201cbut I still want to do this again, just the two of us next time!\u201d", "So much love and thought put into his wife that he made sure to include HIS MOM.\n\n\nDo you frequently bring your parents to intimate couple things?
