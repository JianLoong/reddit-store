Sorry for the bit of extra background here but I think its relevant:\n\nI started talking about my history with the car and how it was the first car I bought by myself to move across the country and get away from my abusive dad. After I graduated from college I decided to move across the country and work for a year before applying for a PhD program but my dad did not approve of that plan and kept holding the car he bought me as a graduation gift over my head saying he wouldn't let me take it to California. Well, I decided to buy my own car and completely sever my last tie of financial dependence on him and I was really proud of it. It felt good to drive away with a big FU. Anyway I moved out to Cali by myself and started a life and it wasn't always easy so that car went through a lot with me! And I really loved it.\n\nMy husband knows this entire back story as he was friends with me at the time all this was happening. Anyway a few years after I had bought the car while I was in grad school my mom started paying my car payment as a way to help me out. She always said she would support me while I was in school, but I got a full scholarship with living expenses paid for so she didn't really have to. So this was just her way of helping out a poor grad student. This lasted for about a year before I insisted I didn't want her to pay anymore.\n\nThe argument: I made a brief statement reminiscing about the car and how much it meant to me to get out from under my dad financially for the first time. My husband said, I mean you didn't really buy it yourself, your mom paid for it for a year, so it doesn't count. I said well that was unnecessary, why did you think it was important to diminish my accomplishment in that moment when I'm thinking back on a happy memory? And he basically just said he was just telling the truth and I don't know how privileged I am that I never had to worry about not being able to pay for my car so I didn't really do anything on my own cause I always could've fallen back on my mom to pay for it. While that's technically true its not like I couldn't afford my car payment (it was less than $200) and needed my mom to bail me out. She just did it so I would have a little more flexibility in my budget and enjoy some nice things while I was a struggling overworked PhD student. And regardless none of that felt relevant when I was just looking back on a happy memory so I kinda went off on him about how rude and unnecessary it was for him to say all that and that i didn't want to talk to him until he apologized.\n\nSo AITA for going off on him?

Year two he racked up a bunch of debt and then joined the navy and finished his degree while he was in for free. \n\nAnd no he hasn\u2019t ever thrown anything in my face like that before. I\u2019m mad that he said it in the context that he did. It just seemed like an unnecessary distinction to make when that wasn\u2019t the point of my comment. I was just thinking back on a happy memory and how I was proud that I could get my own car to do what I wanted and tell my dad to kick rocks.

I was saying that I was proud I initially bought it myself to escape my dad, not that I was proud that I paid for it 100% for the entire life of the car. It just seemed unnecessary to bring up in that moment, like it wasn\u2019t relevant. But maybe it was still warranted, what do you think?", "We had the exact same opportunity school-wise though. We both got full scholarships to undergrad and I worked my ass off and got straight A for 4 years, then went on to get a full scholarship for my PhD. He failed out his first year bc he partied all the time and lost his scholarship, then he racked up debt his second year before dropping out. None of that is even remotely related to the car thing so it just makes no sense to me. Just let me share a happy memory about missing my old car and be proud of myself for one second. Why would someone that loves me feel the need to rain on that parade?", "I don't blame you for your reaction, having something so important to you stepped on like that *hurts*. \n\nThe fact he did it, and that it isn't one of a series of similar behaviors, tells me this was a trigger point for *him* for some reason.\n\nI wonder if there's also some shame and defensiveness over you having completed your degrees while he washed out. You both had scholarships and you succeeded while he failed.  He may be bolstering his ego on the topic by attributing your success and his failure to external factors, namely the presence of parental support.\n\nIf that's the case then you talking about being independent may be inadvertently pressing in on some insecurities for him.", "I think he might have some unresolved issues because you managed to get and keep a scholarship, while he was able to get one but also solely responsible for messing it up...and therefor rather knock your accomplishments down, to make himself feel less like he fucked up his.\n\nScholarships bring money, but also prestige, like you get a reward for being special (as in hard working and/or smart), after all this time I doubt it's about the money he lost out on, but maybe his hurt ego?\n\nI'm gonna go with NTA and I suggest you sit down with your husband and explain to him why his remarks were so hurtful.\nYou did accomplish a lot. You studied, got a PhD, with you father being abusive, you found the strength to leave and the money for it through hard work.\n\nIf he doesn't understand or apologise...

Good to know.", "My judgement would change between N-T-A to N- A-H depending on if he was in a worse position than you.\n\nIf he truly did not have the support like you had for your mother, it's possible that he feels a bit resentful over the fact that you don't acknowledge the safety nets you did have. It could very well be a flash of financial privilege.\n\nWhile it's true that he may be financially stable due to military service, a lot of people make the choice of enlistment not because they want to but because they feel like it's the only way for them to achieve certain things later, such as being able to go to college or get out of a bad situation. It's very possible that the reason he joined the navy really came down to the fact that he didn't have the same support you did, if you get what I mean.\n\nI don't know his full situation, but that's a possible perspective. It baffles me that you have no clue of the financial history of someone you married. That seems like a basic thing to discuss.", "I think it\u2019s good to be regularly reminded of the privileges we have. It helps us stay humble and develop empathy for the less fortunate.", "I appreciate your perspective. Maybe this is a bit deeper than just the car. It was so long ago that he lost his scholarship (10yrs) I didn\u2019t think of it still affecting him. Thanks for your comments", "Nope that\u2019s not what I was saying at all\u2026Just plainly answering the question the above commenter requested.", "That makes sense. I guess I didn\u2019t think of it being an important thing to acknowledge in that moment because a) while I appreciated it, I didn\u2019t NEED my moms financial support to survive. b) whether or not I paid for that car 100% or not did not change my attachment to the car or how proud I was that at the time I bought it, I did it by myself to get away from my dad and do what I wanted. That\u2019s what I was proud of. The fact that I got help with some of the payments years after I bought the car wasn\u2019t important to the happy memory of my old car and how I used it to escape.\n\nAlso, I do know his entire financial history I just wasn\u2019t sure which part of his history you were inquiring about and didn\u2019t think I should detail his entire history in the post. His parents did not offer him financial support after he moved out. His dad was retired navy and that\u2019s a huge part of why he joined. But it was also for some of the reasons you said. He wasted his full ride scholarship to college by flunking all his classes and partying all the time instead of going to classes. So he racked up a bunch of debt his second year when he lost his scholarship. That\u2019s when he decided to join. If there is more of his financial history you need to know for this situation, just ask.", "That\u2019s fair. I agree with you and that\u2019s something i think about often. It wasn\u2019t so much being reminded of my privilege i was annoyed by. More so his timing. I just still don\u2019t think it was necessary to say in that moment when I was just sharing a happy memory of my car lol", "I think unless he's just kinda a pedantic fuck in general then it's 100% a him thing that he should not be taking out on you.\n\nAnd by in general I mean even in situations where the corrections diminish *his* accomplishments. If he's fine with being inexact when it makes him look good, then again, a him thing he needs to work on"]}
