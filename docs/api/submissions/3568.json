Not Wanting to Leave My Apartment So My Ex Can Host His Coworkers", "selftext": "For context, I (23F) and my ex (22M) have been living together until our lease is up in Q2 2023. We were together for nearly 5 years. We are still friendly toward each other but of course there are still disagreements. \n\nMy ex has talked to his coworkers about me, about our issues, and has told me multiple times in conversation that his coworkers \u201chate\u201d me, due to the fact that he was constantly complaining about me, never explaining the things he had done wrong, etc. I\u2019m not gonna say I was the perfect girlfriend, but there were a lot of nice things that he could\u2019ve said about me too. I have never even met these people in person so all they know about me is what he has said. \n\nI have never had anyone in my life tell me I was as \u201cmean\u201c and \u201crude\u201d and \u201cembarrassing\u201d as he has described me. Literally never. \n\nWith Xmas coming around his coworkers want to come by our place to hang out with him. He approached me and asked me to stay at a friends house for the night so they could come over. \n\nFor me, I was shocked. This is still my home until the lease is up. I still pay half of the rent, even though he makes way more than me. Some months, I actually end up paying more than him once the utility bills come in. I told him that I thought it was disrespectful for him to ask me to leave my home so that people who don\u2019t like me could come in and put an ornament on the Xmas tree that I bought and he didn\u2019t even help put up.\n\nI asked him to let me know what date he\u2019s inviting them over so I can just get a hotel. He doesn\u2019t want me pay for a hotel, because I think that would make him feel guilty. So, instead he\u2019s asking me to stay at a friends house, but why do I need to put that burden on my friend? Why is it any of her business? I know my friends like me, but do I really have to bug them so I can stay the night on their couch when I have a perfectly fine room that I already pay for?\n\nSo, am I the asshole for being upset that my ex is kicking me out of our apartment for a night to invite his coworkers that hate me?\n\nTLDR; my ex asked me to leave our shared apartment for a whole night so that he can invite his coworkers over who all hate me.\n\nUpdate: Thanks everyone for taking the time to read and respond. I feel like over time I\u2019ve started to feel like I was the problem because everyone around him didn\u2019t like me. I have bad imposter syndrome in all aspects (work, friends, love relationships) and I let the things he was saying to other people shape how I saw myself. It\u2019s weird that validation from strangers on the Internet would be the thing to make me see my worth. Thank you. I will update after his friends come by.", "created_utc": 1669745651, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z81gw1/aita_not_wanting_to_leave_my_apartment_so_my_ex/", "score": 196, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Chances are the reason he wants you out is because he is going to look like an AH when his coworkers realize you are not actually an ogre /screeching banshee/medusa or whatever else he has painted you as being. \n\nHard for him to play the victim when you are just sitting in the bedroom being all normal and only coming out to make a cup of tea. I say be there and be as sweet and as pleasant and unobtrusive as possible. \"Sorry, didn't mean to disturb the party! I'm just grabbing a cup of tea and then I will be out of your way! Just pretend I'm not here!\"", "Do his coworkers know that you\u2019re still sharing a place?

As I see it, he should be booking you a room at the nicest hotel in your area, as well as providing for a nice dinner, perhaps even a spa day. After all, thanks to his complaining, you now have a reputation to live up to. So don't be be foolish, lean into it. Own it. What do you have to lose, the respect of his friends? Forgive me for being crass, but let your inner asshole loose and make him pay.", "NTA - I would suggest that he should pay for a nice stay at a local spa or resort in exchange for this request.  You are obviously better off without someone who badmouths you to his coworkers.  And telling you to couchsurf rather than stay in a decent place is just further evidence of high-grade AHdom on his part.  F his \"guilt\".  And if he doesn't like that, don't leave--it's your home and he has no business chasing you out of it.", "NTA Stay and let him know you can\u2019t wait to tell them your side of the story!", "NTA.  Asking him which night he wants you to leave was more than reasonable.  A better idea would be for him to get a hotel, so he can have his party and let you stay in your own home in peace.", "Stay in the apartment and when they come, act super nice and polite and friendly. Make your ex look like an asshole for talking trash about it obviously good person. Why can\u2019t they hang out at one of the friends houses? You pay the rent.

I\u2019d give him the option of that or you stay.", "NTA. First off, if you guys were together for 5 years, it's a pretty major self-own on his part to describe you as selfish and rude. It took him 5 years to figure that out? Does he have less ability to judge character than a MAGA? Secondly, he doesn't want you to take a hotel because he knows he's being a goddamned dick.", "NTA\n\nI would have told him to hang with his colleagues elsewhere. Or he can pay for your hotel.", "This story makes me wonder if he has misrepresented many things at work, including when he became single again.
