I think you need to talk with your mother about steps forward - ***not excluding having the sister getting sterilized if she wants to keep her current status quo of getting help. At this point it should be required of her to do so before anymore assistance is given.*** It's utterly ridiculous to be having so many children and not even be 30 yet. By this time next decade, she will have a classroom full of children if she doesn't stop it.\n\nLaury's father can complain as much as he wants and call you a brat, but ultimately he isn't giving her housing or raising her brood now is he? That would be you and your mother, and he can damn well show some appreciation for it - and no, before he says she's a good mother, he needs to rethink that - especially if she's leaving her large brood to be cared for while she goes out and makes another baby. If she has time to breed, she's not using it to raise her children or work to pay for the things her children need.\n\nAt 16, your focus should be on school. The fact you were left watching the boys, I am assuming all 4, the morning after speaks volumes. I assume the children were left overnight if I am not mistaken? She just got emotional and so easily walked out without her children? A good mother doesn't just do that.\n\nObnoxious is also objective. Having 6 children running and screaming about, with you complaining in the background would be considered so, but objectively, it's well within your right to be upset and to complain given your autism - people with it enjoy quiet and like scheduled routines. Children by nature don't. If there were fewer instances of the children being in the home, I bet you would be feeling much more calm and contented, and less likely to be \"obnoxious\".\n\nYour mother may have the financial means to care for these children, but she clearly doesn't have the mental or emotional capabilities now - especially if she didn't defend her daughter and instead cried and went to put one of the children back to bed.\n\n***If everyone is silent, they aren't excited either.
