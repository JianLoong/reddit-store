His failure to plan doesn\u2019t mean you have an emergency on your hands. He actively chooses to not carry a key. That\u2019s 100% on him.", "NTA.  If he's not responsible enough to keep a key on him, he probably shouldn't be living independently.  I know I grew up as a latchkey kid, but I find this entire situation infuriating.", "NTA - when you enable someone to be irresponsible and childish - they stay that way.  Your roommate is not your responsibility.  Personally, I would be petty enough to never open that door for him.  \n\nAlso his entitlement about driving 45 minutes one way to let him in is crazy.  Maybe if he sleeps on the porch enough times - he will think of a solution on how to be an adult.", "NTA.  You are not obligated to drive home from work or disturb your sleep.  He can hide a key or get a biometric lock.", "If it was a one time thing,  it would be reasonable for him to be upset at you. But since it's a chronic issue,  it's on him to fix it.  He has lots of options that he's just ignoring.  He could wear the key around his neck like a 90's latchkey kid but using a retractable cord so the cord stays on his neck and so does the key.
