I've never had to let him in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe roommate that usually lets him in is on a three week travel vacation trip with his girlfriend so he's not been home for a week. My room is in the basement and the small window faces the backyard. The first day of roommate being gone. I was at work(I work 11-7 and my roommate gets home at 3ish usually) and get a call from him. He asks me if I am at home and can let him in. I told him that you know I work 11 to 7. He said he forgot his key and needs let in. He asked if I could stop by and let him in. My job is a 45 min drive away so I told him no. I said your best bet is to call the landlord and pay the fee that he charges to come out and unlock the door. Or call a locksmith. He just groaned and then hung up. The next day there was no issue, but then the day after he calls me at work again asking if I am home. I'm a pretty deep sleeper. I've slept through tornado warnings, loud construction, and thunder. Nothing really wakes me short of someone shaking me or an alarm right in my ear. I also sleep with my phone on mute. I woke up to tons of missed calls and texts at like 4 AM asking to be let in. He eventually gave up and just slept on the porch.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe told me I am being a dick and should let him in. I asked him \"you really think I should leave work, drive 45 minutes home, and let you in every day?\" He said I should have woken up to let him in and that he was knocking on my window but I never responded. I said he is an adult and should bring a key with him when he leaves. I even said that if you are really that bad at taking a key with you. You should just leave the door unlocked. His floor is the middle and the roommate has his upper floor area locked and my basement area is locked so I wouldn't really mind. he said that is not possible because he has expensive instruments and electronics. I just said \"well think of something\" and left it there. He said he doesn't like bringing his key out because when he gets drunk he always loses it anyway which I think is a dumb excuse.

If he loses his keys then he can get a lanyard and wear them around his neck or get a fake rock to put in the yard for a spare key or any number of other solutions that don't require inconveniencing other people regularly.", "NTA. \nHow old is this guy?  \nI wouldn\u2019t let him in either, even if I heard him. This is lower than even basic adulting. \n\nHe remembers to lock the door and that doesn\u2019t instantly make him realize he needs a key?\n\nYou can always tell him to wear his key on a string around his neck like the latchkey kids always did.", "NTA. His failure to plan doesn\u2019t mean you have an emergency on your hands. He actively chooses to not carry a key. That\u2019s 100% on him.", "NTA.  If he's not responsible enough to keep a key on him, he probably shouldn't be living independently.  I know I grew up as a latchkey kid, but I find this entire situation infuriating.", "NTA - when you enable someone to be irresponsible and childish - they stay that way.  Your roommate is not your responsibility.  Personally, I would be petty enough to never open that door for him.  \n\nAlso his entitlement about driving 45 minutes one way to let him in is crazy.  Maybe if he sleeps on the porch enough times - he will think of a solution on how to be an adult.", "NTA.  You are not obligated to drive home from work or disturb your sleep.  He can hide a key or get a biometric lock.", "If it was a one time thing,  it would be reasonable for him to be upset at you. But since it's a chronic issue,  it's on him to fix it.  He has lots of options that he's just ignoring.  He could wear the key around his neck like a 90's latchkey kid but using a retractable cord so the cord stays on his neck and so does the key. Or he could hide a key in a rock or plant at the front door. Or he could switch out his door lock for a digital one that connects to his phone or just needs a code.  NTA", "NTA. \n\nI will suggest having him get those outdoor lockboxes for keys. It\u2019s a small metal you can mount on the wall or hide somewhere and no one can get to the key if they don\u2019t know the pin. We use this often and it\u2019s a life saver.", "Not the a hole you\u2019re his room mate not his mother tell him to grow up and take responsibility", "NTA. He's an idiot.", "NTA - He's an adult. Your life does not revolve around him.", "This isn\u2019t your problem.  If you didn\u2019t exist he would still have this problem.  NTA", "NTA he needs to be an adult and bring his keys.", "NTA, and a few nights of porch sleeping might help him remember to take his key. I don't think I'd bother letting him in even if I was home.", "NTA. He is an adult who does things with the assumption that it's OK to inconvenience someone else so they can help him out. He's not forgetting his key; he leaves it home on purpose, as if it's your Job to wake up at all hours to help out his drunk ass.", "NTA but this has an easy solution. Get a rock key.", "NTA. You are all grown adults, responsible for yourselves. Calling you while you\u2019re at work and asking you to stop by? Inconsiderate. He\u2019s def the TA.", "NTA you did not wake up so you did not hear and you where at work. he's just being entitled now. like really get a key chain or something if its that big a problem.", "INFO: The way you tell it, it's as if you were never in a situation where you could actually consciously hear him and simply refused to go downstairs and let him in.\n\nWere you ever in that situation?  (If not, seems really hard for you to be TA.)", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t even think you\u2019d be TA if you were awake and just didn\u2019t let him in.  He\u2019s a grown adult who needs to problem solve, and you are not the solution.", "nta. you\u2019re not his valet. he can bring his key or he can stay outside.", "NTA, it\u2019s not your responsibility to drive 45 minutes home if you\u2019re working and it\u2019s inappropriate for him to ask you to do that. You\u2019re also not an asshole for not waking up. If you had woken up, you would\u2019ve let him in, but you can\u2019t be an asshole for not letting him in in your sleep. He needs to figure out how to remember his key or needs to hide an emergency key somewhere hidden.", "NTA It is true that if you\u2019re home you should not *choose* to not let him in. But he needs to take responsibility for his house keys like the rest of us, and it is totally unreasonable for you to be on call for him if you are at work, and it\u2019s not your problem if you are so sound asleep you don\u2019t hear him.\n\nUpstairs roommate\u2019s vacation sounds like a great learning opportunity for this guy! Maybe he can figure out a place to hide a spare key for himself.", "NTA - you\u2019re not responsibile for his poor choices.", "NTA. If this were a rare thing and you happened to be around, then it would be reasonable for you to help.\n\nSince this is his regular habit, you should *never* help. This is not your problem to solve and he needs enough incentive to actually come up with a real solution that works for him.", "NTA. You are not responsible for his irresponsibility.", "From the title I was going to say YTA and just let him in\u2026but then I read it. This is a grown adult. His excuse is weak. Also, I can wake up for every little sound. My husband and my kids could sleep through everything.\n\nYou are NTA.\n\n\nHe needs to bring a key or leave a hideaway key under the rock or a mat or something. Lord.", "NTA. \n\nYou could keep fighting this or just go get a key lockbox for like $20 and hang it outside. Put the key on a long piece of string tied to the lockbox so he can't wander off with the key. If he messes up that you can confidently tell him he's the asshole and to fark off.", "This really depends on if you were actually asleep or if you were awake but didn\u2019t want to get up & let him in. \n\nEither way, I still agree that it\u2019s his responsibility to have his key with him & not expect others to deal with his lack of care. \n\nOverall situation, NTA.\n\nIf you were awake & chose not to let him in, YTA in that specific situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His gender doesn't matter. His propensity to forget his keys doesn't change the fact that you aren't home. The roommate being on vacation is immaterial.

I had a door that auto-locked and a shitty memory. The first few times I either waited until my roommate was home on her own schedule to go in with her or I went to her place of work, borrowed the key and then brought it back to her immediately so that she wouldn\u2019t have to be without her own key for any more time. And I apologized profusely because she had no obligation to help me even that much! Then I learned techniques to stop messing up this daily requirement - spare key in the car, a phone case with an attached key, a reminder note on my room door, and a genuine desire to stop bothering my roommate.
