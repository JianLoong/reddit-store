If he\u2019s going to the grocery store, he doesn\u2019t need to dress up. \n\nI think you should be able to wear your comfortable clothes to the store if you want to.", "NTA - to me this is the equivalent of a woman going braless. Can you see the outline of some private parts? Sure. Are you totally covered and really only pervs and prudes would stare? Yes. Are some people going to think it's \"poor taste\"? Yeah and fuck em.\n\nNow I won't go braless in public, but I sure don't judge or stare at women doing so. I don't judge or stare at men in gray pants and I don't stop my husband from leaving the house in gray pants -- though I will tease and flirt with him about it because I'm a bastard that likes to see him blush. He will usually change out of them but only because he realizes it's a thing and HE wants to be more low key in public. He can wear sheer white shorts that let his ass cheeks hang out for all I care.", "Sorry\u2026I thought this was just a post about grey sweatpants being ugly (with grey marle being the absolute ugliest of the greys for clothing).\n\nNTA. Wear what you want\u2026but after listening to how uncomfortable other women seem to feel about a guys penis mound being an unwanted sight, maybe take that into consideration as you dress.", "NTA. It's just that everyone's going to think that you're a lazy loser.", "It doesn\u2019t matter what color they are. If they are tight they are tight. Personally I wouldn\u2019t want to see an outline of your privates just like I don\u2019t like seeing braless females in tight shirts. Wear proper underwear folks", "You can buy joggers in a different material, if the color is what you like, and the material is the issue with the outline. Joggers don\u2019t have to be grey, and they don\u2019t have to be sweatpants material.", "I read this post and all I see is a guy telling the world he's got a big package. But to answer the question NTA", "Stop sexualizing men.", "Then I hope you find a way to conceal your boobs when out in public too. God forbid someone sees an outline of them", "I agree-nta", "Imagine thinking that woman shouldn't wear yoga pants...", "100% agreed. They are tripping over themselves to support the wife...those weird double standards.", "Yeah, I\u2019m surprised (though maybe I shouldn\u2019t be) that the top comment isn\u2019t a resounding NTA because wtf is with trying to forbid a spouse to wear something?", "Ok but people would be up in arms if he didn\u2019t want her to wear leggings because he didn\u2019t didn\u2019t want to \u201cshare the view\u201d, I don\u2019t understand how people are okay with her doing it.", "[deleted]", "My mom once told me about a guy in her high school that would go commando in short-shorts (like, the 70s short-shorts). He left nothing to the imagination and loved the reactions. Huge yikes.", "Right? Grey sweatpants season is popular\u2026for some of us. \ud83d\udc40 (I know, I know.

Your wife may even be willing to help.", "Get some clothing dye and dye them darker", "its because previously people don't understand or respond to nuance well. i mean dress however you like but there was some girl in my past who liked to wear skirts that ended above her panties, and started below them.\n\ni did not enjoy laying my eyes upon her visage, although she was otherwise not unsightly.\n\nI think the truth is that some clothes are simply revealing, whereas others are overtly suggestive. But clothes that outright show the functional parts are niether this nor that, they are unsightly.", "Part of it is that we live in a ra8pey culture.  So dicks make some women uncomfortable.  I literally don't know any woman who hasn't be SA'd, molested or sexually harassed.  Exhibitionists like to show their dicks to intimidate women.  So it's a bit different.", "It's not about ogling a man's dick.  A visible dick outline is a threat for many women, not an enticement.", "LOL. Nope. 100% not that issue. I actally think its funny you took that from my stayment. \n\nWe had a conversation and I explained my thoughts on it. He doesn't wear them because ultimately it was his choice but her understood my view point. \n\nHe also had communicated to me about stuff he like me not wear because x,y, and z. \n\nIt's called communicating.

Breasts and dicks are not comparable", "Ok, but can you post a link to the grey sweatpants dick outline phenomenon, and not athletes in spandex? \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Nah I got flamed in a thread on here for saying people would find the outline of a dude\u2019s junk uncomfortable. This sub is wild sometimes.", "This may be, hands down, the most asinine rationalization I've ever come across.", "That is outrageous. Men are not wearing grey sweatpants to threaten you.
