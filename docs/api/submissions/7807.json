I have a good chunk of college debt, so since I moved in I almost never go out and cook mostly at home. A lot of the food I cook uses a lot of vegetable and olive oil and I usually use a lot of hot water and dish soap to make sure this stuff doesn't build up.\n\nAbout a month ago the sink starting draining extremely slow, and a week later it stopped draining entirely. I called in my landlord and told him about the issue. He called a plumbing company, but because of the holidays, they didn't come in till a week after I called. The plumbers took three hours cleaning out my kitchen drain pipes, and the bill they wrote up was around $350. \n\nBecause it was through the rental company, the plumbing company charged my landlord directly. When my landlord got the bill, he demanded I paid for it. Apparently the plumbing company told him they haven't seen a drain this bad in years, most of these uncloggings only take an hour, not three. According to my landlord, my cooking was responsible for the clogging of the drain.\n\nI refused to pay and the situation escalated from there. I am already a month behind on rent because of holiday shopping but now my leech a landlord is trying to squeeze more and more money out of me. I told him that regular maintenance is to be expected on a unit, and this is nothing new. I also found out that the drainage pipes used on the sink are a 1/4 inch smaller than city code, and  that I am willing to go to court over this issue.\n\nReddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1674188116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gn2xw/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_landlord_a_plumbing/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have found videos with step by step instructions on how to build a coffee table. Gifts mean 10x more when it is something so special and unique.

The issue with oil is, although it's liquid at room temperature, pipes can experience colder temperatures which can lead to solidification, especially if you've cooked fats which will mix with the oils and create solid fat deposits. Where I live, we need to pour used oil back into bottles (cooled down first) and throw out with the rubbish. As it's sorted into recycling etc, the oil is seperated out together....I am not sure what happens past that point.....I'd suspect it's filtered and cleaned and then sold cheap to street food vendors.", ">if you like cooked veggies in a pan with oil you can still just wash it out in the sink with dish soap, right?\n\nIt depends on the amount of oil - are we talking about a light dusting of oil that is all broken down by the dish soap... or are we talking a layer of oil you can pour off?\n\nI have a container for reusable oil and a jar for ruined oil beside my stove where I pour off any excess oil, lightly scraping it into it. \n\n**Disposal:** When the Ruined Oil container is full, I close the container and put it in the trash. Make sure the oil cools if your container isn't glass or metal; because melting plastic can be dangerous; or better choice is to use a metal container to catch it, and periodically pour into another sealable container to dispose of.\n\n**Re-Use:** Amazon also has [various oil jugs](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=kitchen+used+oil+container&crid=3BKA6UHUQOTK2&sprefix=kitchen+used+oil+contain%2Caps%2C212&ref=nb_sb_noss_2) with a filter on top to catch chunks to allow for re-using oil. The one I have is about 1 L and silver. It works well if you do similar cuisine & spices; but can cause some cross-contamination of flavor if you do a wide variety of cuisine & spice mixes. (This can either be good, or bad, surprises :) ) --> but - oil from this container can be re-used (at your discretion) until it's ruined.\n\n**Summary:** If there is enough oil to pour - it should go in a container and not down the drain.. if there is just a film - put soap on it to break it down before washing it away.\n\n(Another redditer above shared [HOW TO DISPOSE OF COOKING OIL](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-do-i-dispose-of-used-cooking-oil-908995))", "Hair clogs pipes.
