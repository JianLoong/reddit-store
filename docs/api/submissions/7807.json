I have a good chunk of college debt, so since I moved in I almost never go out and cook mostly at home. A lot of the food I cook uses a lot of vegetable and olive oil and I usually use a lot of hot water and dish soap to make sure this stuff doesn't build up.\n\nAbout a month ago the sink starting draining extremely slow, and a week later it stopped draining entirely. I called in my landlord and told him about the issue. He called a plumbing company, but because of the holidays, they didn't come in till a week after I called. The plumbers took three hours cleaning out my kitchen drain pipes, and the bill they wrote up was around $350. \n\nBecause it was through the rental company, the plumbing company charged my landlord directly. When my landlord got the bill, he demanded I paid for it. Apparently the plumbing company told him they haven't seen a drain this bad in years, most of these uncloggings only take an hour, not three. According to my landlord, my cooking was responsible for the clogging of the drain.\n\nI refused to pay and the situation escalated from there. I am already a month behind on rent because of holiday shopping but now my leech a landlord is trying to squeeze more and more money out of me. I told him that regular maintenance is to be expected on a unit, and this is nothing new. I also found out that the drainage pipes used on the sink are a 1/4 inch smaller than city code, and  that I am willing to go to court over this issue.\n\nReddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1674188116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gn2xw/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_landlord_a_plumbing/", "score": 315, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know it's a little wasteful - but it does keep the oil sealed and from leaking in the garbage.", "My FIL works for the city sanitation department, hair should go in a bin, no matter if it's short clippings or long hair from a brush. I'm unsure about shaving in the shower, since I don't do it, but I'm guessing the hairs are so small they will be unnoticeable in the sewage or pipes... But if I clip my bangs that goes in the bin too", "Why aren't you abiding by the lease by paying rent and abiding by common sense by not dumping oil down the drain?", "I also have electrical in some of my units and plumbing that doesnt \"meet code\".  The thing is, decades ago when it was installed, it did meet the code.  Code gets updates and usually better as time goes on.  E.g. some of my outlets dont have grounds on them.  Not permitted in new installs but are grandfathered in and can continue to operate.", "Oh, gotcha!", "I have an old oil bottle that I decant it into then I can either put in the bin or if I'm going to the recycling centre they have a cooking oil recycling spot", "We keep jars from stuff like pasta sauce and put all oils and fats into and then toss them when full.", "If you're in the UK, there's often a cooking-oil recycling point at your local tip. I don't know if other countries have anything similar though.", "Disposals can be a learning experience in themselves(I remember AOC getting flack for making jokes about her new/first time with a garbage disposal online)\n\nThe first house, we rented, that had a garbage disposal(it didn't come with a manual and it was pre-google days) we didn't really use it  Until one day we found weevils(?) got into a bunch of stuff in Pantry.  \n\nSo we(kids) put down everything bad....including uncooked rice.  \n\nWhat a mess.  Landlord was not happy.", "The funny thing is the worst tenants I\u2019ve had are family and friends.", "The tenant isnt the victim in this case, and I will admit that there are horrible tenants but ANYONE who willingly makes a profit off of a human necessity is a leach.", "And only bootlicking potatoes stand up for landlords.", "Man I wish I thought of this the other night when I didn\u2019t have any spare glass jars. Thanks for the tip!", "If it is enough to pour out, into the jug it goes", "Maybe just throw out the contents and recycle the jars. Just sayin", "There's also a declogging powder sold in Wal-Mart that works wonders. Just pour the powder in, let it set for a few hours, and flush with hot water. It took care of a paper clog in my toilet that was just out of reach of my augur but I've also used it for sink clogs.", "Unfortunately for grease that doesn't really work. Especially if it's years worth of build up.", "Caustic soda plus boiling water was what my Mam used to use. \n\nIt worked lovely, but the first and only time I tried it I ended up dissolving my own fingerprints.\n\nAlso it's not on sale in this country any more, because some maniac tried to use it to make a bomb.\n\nIf you can get hold of some (in a legal and safe manner, you do NOT want to try buying it from some shifty guy over Amazon, yes I tried that and it was STUPID of me) then caustic soda is like the nuclear option of the drain world. My Mam swears she once used it to dissolve a dead rat that got stuck in our waste pipe.", "It would be funny if it were not so sad and infuriating", "I hear you, we had a friend live with us for six months... Never ever again.\n\nHe wanted to rent our place but luckily we had already entered a agreement with the leasing agent and she turned him down...\n\nWe've also turned colleges and old neighbours down.", "Well in all honesty what do you expect?\n\nNo matter if the house is standing empty or has poeple live in it the owner is going to have to pay maintenance and taxes.\n\nAnd in the first few years the rent covers the mortgage but when the mortgage is paid off so you suggest the owner suddenly stops charging rent?\n\nThe owner of the property took the risk of buying l, and is paying maintenance and insurance as well as taxes...\n\nIf a tenant is unwilling or unable to purchase a property of thier own and take that risk then unfortunately they have to pay for the service provided...\n\nAccording to your argument all groceries, clothes and other necessary items items should be free as well...", "Landlords can be good or bad if your experience with landlords is always bad maybe you need to look in the mirror", ">By ruined, do you mean until the oil's gone off/rancid? \n\nIt could be this - though generally it's more the latter option. That said - the more often you use it for food - the more likely a contaminant from the food will inspire it to turn rancid.  \n\n>Or is there a limit to the amount of times cooking oil can be reused?\n\nYes - Over time food particles and spices get into the oil. Over time it gets darker and more burnt. Eventually it will add a burnt flavor to the food.\n\nIf you are always cooking the same thing in the oil - you can use it for longer periods of time than if you are cooking different things and want to minimize impact from one to another.\n\nCooking shrimp in Oil will make it go bad much faster than cooking plane fries, for example. I'm not sure I'd re-use shrimp oil for anything other than shrimp or keep it long afterwards ... but oil for French fries I'd be happy to re-use if it didn't get too dark & gunky for anything, not just for fries.", "To build upon your comment, it is also a good idea to occasionally pour a 50/50 mixture of vinegar and boiling hot water down the drain as maintenance to clean up any residual build up of grease that will inevitably go down the drain. One every 6 months or so is fine.\n\nTake care of your drains and they will take care of you.", "The drains love language was holding onto oil and grease", "This is not going to get downvoted!!! Everyone except the OP recognizes that he or she is not just an AH, but a complete irresponsible can't-say-it-or-my-comment-will-be-removed!\n\nI'm sorry you had that experience. I had a similar one with my first home (minus the cigarettes and cats), and the people were supposed to be my friends!! Ha!", "Not all landlords are awful, that\u2019s a fact. I\u2019ve had amazing landlords and really bad ones. It\u2019s unfortunate we only see the bad ones get talked about.", "When it comes to plumbing, phrases like \u201ccovered in crap\u201d and \u201cshit happens\u201d are almost always literal.", "I see, that makes sense. Thank you for the detailed explanation!", "Unfortunately their are way more tenants than owners and the majority voice is that owners are evil and profiting from basic necessities...\n\nIm sorry you had that experience as well, especially from friends, that makes it even worse...", "Ugh, everything was broken when they moved out. Things I didn't see when I would visit them because an occupied house looks way different from an empty one. I am not exaggerating when I tell you that every wall - EVERY - had to be patched and/or repainted. They \"painted\" bedrooms but didn't tape off the woodwork, so one room had paint smears all over the woodwork and another room had the paint stop about an inch from the woodwork and then an ugly space with the old paint showing through. Holes in almost every wall. (We HaVe ThReE bOYS!) (My parents had four - we never had holes in our walls!) They laid bricks end to end beyond the back door and called it a patio. Said it \"increased the value of the home!\" What BS!! They didn't even level the ground under the bricks or put anything down to stabilize the bricks. When they moved out, there were enormous weeds growing up in between every two bricks. I could go on and on. I took them to court and got about 1/10th of what I spent to fix everything."]}
