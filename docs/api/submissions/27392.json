It's just nice to talk with your partner about things like this. Although it is different when you're married and even more important, especially if you share finances.

I would definitely have a talk with her about it.", "NTA Not unreasonable to expect some communication, especially in a long-distance relationship.", "NTA - seems like she\u2019s checked out of this marriage.

Obviously she should've at least mentioned it before now. I don't think she's very committed to you two being together.", "Yes, she indeed has to attend an appointment in that city this weekend, I've known that from the beginning, and we've discussed the trip. But she never mentioned she was going to the festival. She's gonna go alone, which makes me a little fearful because we live in a third-world country with high rates of violence against women.", "She has an appointment in that city this weekend, so we were talking about that and what she would do. She mentioned that she would visit some relatives and that's when she told me she would go to the festival.", "Yes, we talk in a daily basis about our days, what we did and what was good or bad. I\u2019m not in our home country so I rarely do something beyond work. She is in our home country, so usually she has more to tell. But never mentioned this.", "Thank you :) I trust her completely, and honestly, I don't even think that she might be lying when she tells me she'll go alone. Suspicious behavior? Totally.", "Yeah, and we've discussed these kinds of behaviors before. I try to share my plans and stuff with her even if they don't directly involve her because, first I like her to know my plans and second, after all, we're not just dating, we're married, so individual decisions each of us makes in a way affect the other.", "Thank you. Yes, that's part of what I mentioned in another response. We're not just dating; in some way, our individual decisions do affect each other. However, what I think affects me the most and makes me feel bad is not being informed, which makes me feel like I'm not important to her. I mean, come on! You got a ticket to go to a festival we were both interested in, and you wait until a day before to tell me? I don't know, it just seems a bit disappointing.", "Thank you!", "Thanks. I'll come back in december... Let's see how it turns out.", "I think both. Of course I'd like to know her plans (at least big plans like this), but also because is a festival we were talking about in the past but decided to not assist because was to expensive to go and then the moving to a new country came. So knowing that she would go was going to make me very happy at that moment.", "I understand. I don't expect her to 'report' to me as if she's giving statements or explanations for everything she does. It's not something I expect to be one-sided either. I share my plans with her because I'm interested in her knowing where I am and because I like sharing my interests with her.  \nThere's no checklist of things. For example, in the movie scenario you mentioned, if she's willing to go to another city just to see that movie, it's because she really likes it, and as her spouse, I would expect to know because I would expect her to share her likes with me. I believe it's part of a relationship. I would expect her to have told me when she bought the ticket something like 'heey!! I managed to buy a ticket for the festival!!' and that's it. Making me a part of the situation. Finding out just a day before makes me feel like I'm not important to her and that she's not interested in involving me in her life.", "you are confusing communicating as adults with being controlling . who hurt you ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwhen you are into a committed relationship , you are suppose to communicate with your partner , even if you are not  living together during that time  ...the fact that she has not even mentioned this to OP ...is weird and a RED FLAG .....", "This is such a bizarre comment. There's a huge difference between buying a ticket to a weekend long festival that you hide from your spouse (yes, buying a ticket and then not saying anything about it IS hiding it) and reporting daily activities like going to a grocery store.\n\nIn OP's case I do not see malice, more like she was probably just nervous about telling him because she didn't want him to be disappointed or upset that she was going alone, but hiding things from your spouse when there is NO reason to hide anything is very odd behavior and most people will have a problem with it.", "[removed]", "Thank you. I doubt that's the case, as I am in another country and couldn't attend regardless.", "We\u2019ve been together for 12 years. Of course I won\u2019t toss everything in the trash without talking things and trying to fix it before. Thank you for your comment :)", "So she did tell you. I was wondering if you found out by accident.", "That\u2019s good. Just one question, did she forgot to tell you or why didn\u2019t she? \n\nAnother possibility is that she could be angry at you or something and that\u2019s why she decided to go on her own.\n\nBetter communication is probably needed, so neither of you get worried like this.", "I hope you are right. People dont go around forgetting about big events like a music concert.\n\nGood luck in your marriage.", "Is it just that you want to know or that you want to control what she does? In another comment, you mention she was nervous to tell you. Are you saying she shouldn\u2019t go to a music festival? That seems a bit controlling. Wanting to know is fine, but how does this effect you if you weren\u2019t going to see each other during that time anyway?", "Okay. This is a common thing - the issue is just communication. You just need to talk to each other. Tell her how you feel about this whole situation, and make sure she knows how this made you feel. It'll be about finding a middle ground that works for you both. Navigating long distance is hard, never mind when you're married.", "I wish you the best :)", "did she bought the ticket long time ago or just bought on a spur of moment and told you after ?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I also would like to know how her being nervous about telling me implies that I think she shouldn't go to a music festival. At no point am I trying to control what she does.", "Thanks! :) We've already talked about it and expressed how we feel about the situation. It is indeed a communication issue, a significant one, considering that we talk daily and chat about what happens in our day-to-day lives. It's just weird that she 'forgot' to tell me about this. But anyway.", "Long time ago", "it\u2019s possible she thought you\u2019d be jealous she got to go while you can't\n\nedit cuz i can't brain today", "It\u2019s also possible she genuinely forgot? Unless this is a pattern with suspicious results.\n\nBut if I were to use myself as an example, I often forget that stuff until something pops up to remind me. I have actually forgotten to tell people I\u2019d go on vacation once. My brain was too occupied with other things. \n\nHowever, if you are uncertain and insecure about it, definitely address that, because it sounds like there\u2019s a different root that\u2019s causing you those feelings. \n\nShe\u2019s your wife, I\u2019d assume she would like to know you are having those feelings.", "Not just her being nervous but you thinking she sounded nervous (she didn\u2019t post so I don\u2019t know if she was, but why you\u2019d focus on that as anything but \u201chey cool, you don\u2019t have to be nervous\u201d but like a bad thing seemed weird). I don\u2019t understand why you focused on that if you\u2019re fine with her going and just want to know. That seems like it\u2019s fixed more by just sharing with her you want to be more included (not that she needs to get approval, just share) but your manner of thinking seems more like it would shut down conversation, I guess. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong I can see so if she\u2019s nervous, that\u2019s an issue in your relationship unless she\u2019s just a nervous person. And you focusing on her being nervous makes it sound like you think she did something wrong.", "NTA, it's just this subreddit calling every attempt for communication as controlling behaviour. I also expect my fiancee to inform me if she has plans like this because then i won't get worried if i can't contact her when she's still enjoying her time out there.", "Yeah that is a bit weird.", "this begs to question why she didnt tell you ... might be good or bad but this definitely needs a face to face conversation and to communicate better", "Yes, it is absolutely possible. Thanks! :)", "Ah, I understand now. I didn't solely focus on that; it was something I noticed and mentioned because it caught my attention. It's definitely something we should work on in our relationship, and it can be resolved through conversation and understanding each other. Thank you! :D", "Sure, we need to talk and improve communication, I totally agree on that. Thank you for your comment :)"]}
