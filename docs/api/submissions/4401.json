My dad told me that's the gig, you don't have to like it but when your parent marries someone, they become your parent too. They mentioned when they married 18 months later that calling her mom would be the right thing to do, and she told me repeatedly how it hurt her feelings that I didn't want to and then she insisted that I call her ma'am if I wouldn't call her a mom name.\n\nWith my mom's husband it was so different. He started out asking me about video games and art and he told me he hoped we could be friends, and maybe family in the future, but that friends was good too. When my dad and his wife were pushing the whole mom thing I had asked him what he wanted me to call him. He said there was no way to wear out his name so I was free to use that or his childhood nickname that only his favorite people got to use. I used his name for a few more months but by the time he was living with me and mom, I was using the nickname.\n\nWhen I was 11 dad and his wife moved to another town to take care of her parents.

At the same time my mom's husband would listen to me vent about dad and her, but never spoke a word, and sometimes even reminded me that even if I felt like he preferred his wife, he still loved me.\n\nMy dad and his wife had three daughters together. Mom and her husband have 5 kids. I think dad's wife only having girls deprived her of the son she always wanted and it made her want me to be her son even more.

She said it wasn't fair to compare him and she's my second mom.

His mother's partner saw things differently, but that doesn't make him right or her wrong, it just means that they saw things differently. \n\nOP has presented no evidence or abuse, hostility or favoritism from his step mother -- who, again, it needs to be stated that he lived part-time with for at least 11 years, and has been a part of his life for more than 3/4ths of it. He simply likes the man his mother married more than the woman his father married. He's entitled to think that, but he's a prick for throwing it in her face.

That would feel pretty hostile to most people. \n\nAs for embarrassing his dad\u2019s wife at the wedding. He is literally treating her the same as his step-dad. He isn\u2019t excluding her from family pictures, he just isn\u2019t treating her as equal to his mother. The parent of the groom roles are reserved for his bio parents. She is the one demanding a special role.", ">His mother's partner saw things differently, but that doesn't make him right or her wrong, it just means that they saw things differently\n\nBased upon the results I'd say the step father absolutely was right. \n\nForcing relationships does not work. Had the step mother simply treated OP with kindness,  respect,  and love,  a bond might have naturally formed.  Instead she demanded OP immediately think of her as a mom.  That's not how feelings work.", "I mean I think cursing him out when told no shows she doesn\u2019t really care about him, but what she thinks a relationship with him means. Also he said she would say to his dad/her friends in front of him that his mom was selfish for \u201chogging him\u201d. That\u2019s an attempt at parental alienation. And she\u2019s demanding to be treated the exact same as his actual mother. \n\nShe came into his life with an exact expectation of what their relationship was going to be, and it was going to be like that immediately. And she didn\u2019t give a shit if he was comfortable or not. Her feelings were all that mattered. Like to actually tell a kid how much they\u2019re hurting your feelings because they don\u2019t want to call you mom?? How gross, how selfish.\n\nHer behavior pushed him away, and she has never made up for it. She is owed nothing from him. It sounds like his mom\u2019s husband approached him like he was a person of his own, not an insta-son. Like he actually cared about OP\u2019s feelings over his own.\n\nIf step mom is upset, she should look at her own behavior and think about how poorly she\u2019s behaved and consider herself lucky to get an invitation to the wedding at all."]}
