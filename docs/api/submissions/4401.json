My dad and mom both met their spouses within a couple of years of the divorce. I met my dad's wife first. I was introduced to her within four months of their relationship and she made it clear from the get go she wanted a mother-son relationship with me. My dad told me that's the gig, you don't have to like it but when your parent marries someone, they become your parent too. They mentioned when they married 18 months later that calling her mom would be the right thing to do, and she told me repeatedly how it hurt her feelings that I didn't want to and then she insisted that I call her ma'am if I wouldn't call her a mom name.\n\nWith my mom's husband it was so different. He started out asking me about video games and art and he told me he hoped we could be friends, and maybe family in the future, but that friends was good too. When my dad and his wife were pushing the whole mom thing I had asked him what he wanted me to call him. He said there was no way to wear out his name so I was free to use that or his childhood nickname that only his favorite people got to use. I used his name for a few more months but by the time he was living with me and mom, I was using the nickname.\n\nWhen I was 11 dad and his wife moved to another town to take care of her parents. So I was every other weekend with them after the move. They wanted me to move with them but I didn't want to and I knew my dad's wife disliked my mom afterward.

At the same time my mom's husband would listen to me vent about dad and her, but never spoke a word, and sometimes even reminded me that even if I felt like he preferred his wife, he still loved me.\n\nMy dad and his wife had three daughters together. Mom and her husband have 5 kids. I think dad's wife only having girls deprived her of the son she always wanted and it made her want me to be her son even more. But today I really don't care for her and if dad were dead or they were divorced, she would get no invite to my wedding at all. While my mom's husband is one of my favorite people.\n\nMy dad's wife has been all up my butt about what she'll be doing at the wedding and how she should be treated the same as my mom. She's just as much my parent, etc. I said she wasn't and she was not going to be a parent of the groom. That she's dad's plus one, just like mom's husband is her plus one. She said it wasn't fair to compare him and she's my second mom. I told her I would rather give him the title of parent of the groom than her and she needed to accept she would never be a mother of the groom.
