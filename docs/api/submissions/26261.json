So he comes home from work and knocks on the door about 12pm, I have no idea who it is so I stop what I'm doing and answer it and it's him. So I say \"Dont you have keys on you?\" and he replies \"Yeah but it takes too long to get them out and use them so I just knock and if no one answers then I'll use them.\" and I reply \"So you just inconvenience other people instead?\" and he got legit mad and replied sarcastically \"Wow I really ruined your life by making you answer the door.\" And it's just like ????? he literally has keys on him, why should I answer for him? It could have been anyone knocking so of course I'm going to answer it. This guy is 20 and is too lazy to use his own keys that are on him lmao. I just don't know how to go about it next time he knocks cos he'll probably get annoyed if I bring it up since he says it's such a 'small inconvenience' to just answer. And if he thinks I'm intentionally not answering the door for him he'll think that's me trying to 'get back' at him. This whole situation is absolutely ridiculous to me.
