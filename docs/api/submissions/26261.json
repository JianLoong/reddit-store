{"id": 26261, "submission_id": "16apjxb", "title": "AITA for not answering the door anymore when my brother knocks when he's home from work?", "selftext": "Basically, this guy literally has his keys ON HIM, but refuses to use them for the front door when he comes home from work unless no one's in and he has to because he says it's 'too much effort' to use them. Apparently this has been happening a few weeks and my parents just laugh it off/ignore it. So he comes home from work and knocks on the door about 12pm, I have no idea who it is so I stop what I'm doing and answer it and it's him. So I say \"Dont you have keys on you?\" and he replies \"Yeah but it takes too long to get them out and use them so I just knock and if no one answers then I'll use them.\" and I reply \"So you just inconvenience other people instead?\" and he got legit mad and replied sarcastically \"Wow I really ruined your life by making you answer the door.\" And it's just like ????? he literally has keys on him, why should I answer for him? It could have been anyone knocking so of course I'm going to answer it. This guy is 20 and is too lazy to use his own keys that are on him lmao. I just don't know how to go about it next time he knocks cos he'll probably get annoyed if I bring it up since he says it's such a 'small inconvenience' to just answer. And if he thinks I'm intentionally not answering the door for him he'll think that's me trying to 'get back' at him. This whole situation is absolutely ridiculous to me.

Put in earphones as soon as you hear him knocking (even if you don't know for sure it's him) and then just say, \"sorry, I had my phones in and couldn't hear you\".

My sister sometimes too, but not nearly as much. My mom always has her keys on her. But she also insists on carrying her entire life and half of Texas in her bag at all times. And so she doesn't want to \"dig around in her bag defined them\". so she expects me to drop what I am doing, regardless of how important it is, to come down and get the door for her. I have expressed to her on multiple occasions how irritating it is, especially because I work freelance from home and I don't want to have to abruptly stop my work just because she doesn't wanna be inconvenienced to get her keys. Even my dad thinks that it's asinine, but he doesn't say anything.\n\nIt's different if like her hands are full or something, but nine times out of 10, that's not the case. I'll come down there and she's just standing there, staring into the window on the door with this stupid \"Pwease dont be angwy at me\" guilty smile that a kid might make when they get caught doing something. It's incredibly irritating. And I'm gonna not lie, I've often times been tempted to not answer the door and just act like I've had my headphones on or something.\n\nAnyway, not that anyone asked. Bottom line, in my opinion, NTA. He can stop being lazy and get his damn keys", "That's just rude. Quit~~e~~ answering the door, and don't acknowledge him when he complains.
