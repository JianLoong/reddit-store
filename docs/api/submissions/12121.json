People are not obligated to relive their trauma for you in order to \"prove\" that it impacted them deeply. That's a terrible thing to make someone do, especially when you're already dismissing their experience as \"supposed trauma\" before you even know what happened to them.", "She was twisting herself up to accept it being her son's name for her husband's sake.

I said he would be if he forced her to use the name and didn't understand her feelings. She was considering herself selfish for wanting to not use the name, for feeling the way she did about the name because he liked it. She was in so much distress. I do believe it would be selfish to make her use it anyway in those circumstances.", "I couldn't disagree more with your take. OP's SIL approached *her* because she needed another perspective on a very loaded subject. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, especially in this situation, because both the SIL and her husband both had such deep emotional attachments to the proposed name (for two very different reasons), so confiding in someone who doesn't have those same attachments is perfectly logical, as they can offer a more rational opinion. \n\nClearly, the SIL was struggling with this dilemma a great deal and needed time and encouragement to open up to her husband, which is exactly what OP guided her to do, so saying she had turned this into a \"husband v. wife scenario\" is totally wrong:\n\n> *\"I encouraged her to be open with her husband and to not give into the name just to please him, because she didn't deserve to be traumatized every time someone used her son's name.\"*\n\nAnd OP absolutely did not say that SIL's husband was selfish. She said that if SIL talked honestly to her husband and opened up to him about how conflicted she felt giving her baby a name that represented only pain and trauma to her, and he *still* insisted they used that particular name, then that would make him selfish:\n\n> *\"She asked if it made her selfish and I told her no. That if her husband couldn't understand why it would be hard for her that it would make him selfish.\"*\n\nAnd she's right. It *would* make him selfish. \n\nPeople are allowed to confide in others when they need a different perspective. OP is not an AH for providing a safe and encouraging space for her SIL to open up about very difficult subjects.", "Then he is worlds biggest asshole to not care about his wife\u2019s mental health and more about honoring his dead father.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure his dead father would be disappointed in the man his raised if he was alive today.\n\nNTA", "I suppose that is a compromise, but (I presume?) if your SIL has significant trauma associated with the name, not using the name in any capacity would be the ideal solution for her, so that she doesn\u2019t have to think about that person at all.

Initially I thought it might be to use that name as a middle name. Still insisting on it being a first name but just not referring to the child by it feels like he\u2019s really minimising her feelings. That could be me projecting though!", "There is real trauma that people go through, i.e., abuse, violence, medical issues, mental illness, etc.", "Not what I asked.  I'm asking if there was any compromise she was willing to do (like maybe it's the child's middle name and she never have to acknowledge that) or did you simply say no matter what he says tell him no", "You admitted yourself it is a very loaded subject for BOTH parties but the only correct solution is prioritising SILs needs. However since its a loaded subject it would not be too much a stretch to say Husband will be upset and be reluctant at first. This is reasonable as long as he eventually gives in, its human nature to be upset. However OP clearly stated that if he wouldn't understand he WOULD BE SELFISH. This is completely invalidating his response and as I already addressed she may as well have said he is selfish because he was always going to have a little trouble with it at first, especially since sil initially seemed OK with it. At a subconscious level causing SIL to believe he is selfish.\n\nBasically as you admitted yourself OP more or less said the husband is selfish as he was always going to react in said way. The correct way to go about this would be to address how he is going to react but encourage her sil this reaction is OK and he will eventually understand", "Yes, that would be my thinking. She was in so much distress over the name and I cannot imagine, especially in those early days, filling out paperwork or hearing the name when she was already fragile from a slightly tricky birth and adding in her past trauma on top of that whenever the name was mentioned.", "Yes, and the fact that it took the SIL an *entire month* to build up the courage to open up to her husband about how much distress this particular name caused her is a pretty good clue that what she went through was something really bad. We don't need to insist on knowing all the gory details.\n\nYou don't get to judge what qualifies as \"trauma\" for someone else. And again, people are in no way obligated to rehash their deeply painful experiences in order to plead their case to you.", "Most likely is was sexual abuse based on context. However it doesn\u2019t matter. Trauma is different for everyone. Doesn\u2019t mean someone trauma is less because someone out there had it worse.", "She never mentioned a compromise to me. Just that she'd push through it for him.", "There wasn't a compromise that wouldn't cause the SIL distress, though, and I'm guessing that's why she went to OP. If she was willing to compromise, she simply would have, but in the end she couldn't bring herself to use that name and was worried that made her selfish. \n\nIt seems like she was struggling a great deal and needed someone to reassure her that her feelings were valid and not irrational, and that's what OP did.", "That is completely wrong. She never said that if the husband was upset about not using the name that would make him selfish. She said if he refused to understand and made the SIL go through with the name, *that* is what would make him selfish. And she's absolutely correct, it *would* make him selfish to make her use the name regardless of how much stress it caused her.\n\nOP even clarified it further in her comment to you. It's literally right there:\n\n> *\"I said he would be if he forced her to use the name and didn't understand her feelings\"*", "Really, good for you for helping her muster the confidence she needed!", "For baby doctors appointments they call them back by their first name. So every appointment she would hear the name. Not to mention school events and teachers. The closest thing to a compromise is middle name. But who would want their partner to be in pain hearing their own child name", "Eh, that's my opinion, and you're entitled yours. A lot of people say they have trauma over things our super small and they make a bigger deal out of things. The problem with that is that it hijacks support from people who have real trauma.\nI don't know what the sister-in-law went through, but that's why I would like to know.", "NTA", "She left it pretty vague in the original post and I didn't see the clarification until now. I still think it was a stupid comment to make even after seeing the clarification. It goes with out saying that if she was forced into using the name then she should leave him. However it was never hinted he would force her so I think it was an absolutely stupid comment abouy a hypothetical situation that wouldn't happen so why would you go there in the first place. By making the comment you are just worrying SIL that it is a possibility and again, creating that subconscious link that husband would act in such a selfish way. Completely unnecessary.\n\nI'll explain it on a way that is much more obvious.\n\nImagine SIL had an argument with husnand. She asked OP for advice and OP told her \"If husband ever hits you don't hesitate to call 911\".\n\nWould you not agree that OP is implying that husband is violent and aggressive and is blowing an argument completely out of proportion by linking it to a scenario that will never happen. If I was SIL it wouldn't be very encouraging to hear this would it?\nSimilarly OPs comment has the same effect, except on a trivial level making OP the asshole", "\"honoring his father\" should come waaay below his wife's mental health. \n\nNTA, well done for being a supportive friend", "NTA \n\nConsidering she told him all about the issues she has with that name, he\u2019s just looking for someone to blame.

My other brother got my father's first name as a middle name. They're both named after our dad, but there was no pressure on either of them to \"live up to their namesake.\"", "NTA. Your SIL needs someone to look out for her, since apparently her husband will not.", "NTA. You gave your friend good advice. Did she communicate all of this to her husband?", "I was named after my aunt who died as a teen only a 3 years after she passed. It was the biggest mistake my parents made. It has negatively impacted my entire life and relationships with my family. \n\nIf the name reminds your sister of a trauma the baby WILL pick up on that emotion and only assume it is related to them. You did nothing wrong, as you were confided in and asked for your perspective", "NTA\nYour SIL asked for advice, you gave her advice (and it was excellent advice), she used your advice, and now her husband is butthurt. You're not the asshole here, your SIL is not selfish, her husband is a straight up dick. Good for you for sticking with your SIL, she obviously needs somebody in her corner", "NTA\n\nSIL asked for your opinion. You gave it.

Plus, he thinks that family has no business discussing family issues with her? Does he always try to keep her separate from the rest of the family?", "Yeah, a giveaway that he\u2019s a controlling ass is that he thinks a \u201ccompromise\u201d to naming the kid what he wants is to name the kid what he wants.", "Agree. I share my first name with my late grandma and my life choices would probably kill her a second time.\n\nOr make her clutch her pearls in one and a rosary in the other hand as she chants bible verses. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Hellyeah \ud83d\ude00I\u2019m glad we all are rewriting our passed down names", "My grandma used to sing an old song, \"My papa's name was Ferdinand, my mama's name was Liza, they named me after both of them and called me Ferdiliza!\"", "Missed opportunity to go for James James Morrison Morrison.", "Renesmee Carlie Cullen.

It's not your fault that name brings up traumatic memories for her, and you did the right thing in supporting her. If he's throwing a tantrum this much over a name, I feel sorry for the shit your sister is going to deal with while raising her child when he wants something done differently.", "NTA.\n\n\"I discouraged her from trying to reach a compromise of using it as a given name \" LOL\n\nthe SIL giving in to the name is not a compromise", "uhm NTA\n\nthing about honor names and all must be on board. trauma can not be a passenger i am afraid.", "No good spouse would want to further traumatize someone they loved by forcing an issue like this.", "As someone who comes comes from families where several family members were named after other family members to honor them, I find this tradition annoying and ridiculous. BIL sounds like an asshole with no empathy, compassion and care for his wife\u2019s trauma and feelings. BIL is the asshole who thinks \u201chonoring his father\u201d should come before SiL\u2019s ptsd. NTA. Sounds like SIL is in an abusive relationship with BIL.

It's good she has you to talk to, sounds like he's a bully.", "I\u2019m named after my very catholic great grandmother and covered in tattoos so same boat \ud83d\ude02 10/10 would not approve of my life choices.

Change it if you don't like it.\n\nMy parents gave me a series of names that were so bad that it upsets me every time I think of them. I started telling them when I was 3 years old that I was going to change the whole thing when I grew up. \n\nWhen I reached my 21st birthday, I chose a name I loved, and I went to court to make it my legal name. It's been mine for nearly 43 years, and I still love it.\n\nWhat blows my mind to this day is this: I told everyone who would listen several times a day for 18 years that I hated my birth name and I was going to get rid of it when I turned 21. Yet; they were all shocked when I actually did it!", "Me too! I love it for us \ud83d\ude00 tattoos are the best", "I literally can't sleep from wondering about that poor kid's name. Tedgar Dandrew?

And we just fostered him, he didn't even stay for us for more a few months.", "NTA. You were minding your own business. She confided in you. She asked for your opinion and advice. You gave it. Maybe her husband should be more worried about what he did wrong, to prevent her from being able to just as comfortably confide in him instead of riding your ass. That being said, you should discuss this with your husband, if you're comfortable, and decide together whether you should tell SIL. My personal opinion is that she has the right to know what a jackass her husband is being, but I'm not in your shoes. All I know is, if my SIL confided in me, instead of her husband, and then he tried to give me shit for it later, I'd have put him in his place.

The boys in my partners family always have their grandfathers first name as their middle name. There was no way I was giving my kid Allen as a middle name, or hurting my own dad by not doing his name. So I smashed them together till I found a acceptable compromise.
