She has a daughter who is 17, who I consider mine in everyway, but she doesn't see it that way and I try to respect that. Her father is still in the picture, but she only visits one weekend a month. We usually have a decent relationship, but recently there's been some tension\nYou see after my wife and I got married, her and my stepdaughters financial situation improved massively. With our combined incomes I was able to move them out of the dumpy neighboorhood they were living in, and we enrolled our daughter in a private school near our new home.\n\nShe wasn't happy about leaving her friends and old neighboorhood behind, but ultimately this will go miles towards helping her choose colleges once she graduates. She's currently in her senior year. She's mostly calmed down about the move and the school itself, but one thing she constantly complains about is the uniform.\nIt's a pretty standard school uniform I think. Blazer jacket and tie and all, but they make her wear skirts. They're allowed to wear pants under that, but they still have to wear the skirt, which she hates. I don't think it's a big deal, and it will prepare her for the real world where there are dress codes and other cultures that dress differently than we'd prefer.\n\nThe issue is it's been two years, and she never stopped being so vocal about hating it. She calls it her \"torture suit\" and makes a big deal about changing out of it as soon as she gets home. This is a bit of a pain for us because of the extra laundry, so we had her start doing her own laundry as a condition of changing when she gets home.\n\nThe other day she was once again on a tirade about how much of a war crime it is that she wears a skirt, and I'd had enough. I grounded her for the next few days, and told her to stop complaining. My wife upheld the punishment, but wishes I'd talked to her first. She thinks she has a right to be uncomfortable, but I don't think that justifies her being making a scene about it every day.", "created_utc": 1678171700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11krwg0/aita_for_not_tolerating_my_stepdaughters/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Teaching her how to do her own laundry is an important life skill- but it shouldn\u2019t be a punishment. Every uniformed school kid I ever knew ditched their uniform the second they get out of school- why are you bitching about \u201cextra\u201d laundry? This is normal behavior and keeps down the wear on her blazers and skirts. \n\n2. From your writing here it sounds like you feel that you saved your wife and her daughter and improved her situation- for which she should be grateful. News flash: from her perspective you and her mother uprooted her life and took her away from her friends in order to marry you. She didn\u2019t really get a say, or a chance to say \u201cNo, mom, please don\u2019t marry him until I\u2019m out of the house.\u201d We usually do t give kids that kind of power. And it sounds like you expect her to be grateful for this. - OP, she is a teenager who doesn\u2019t have the long-term vision to see the benefits that *might* occur because of two plus years of private school. Gratitude- real gratitude- isn\u2019t going to happen until she is in her 20\u2019s if she actually ever feels that the adjustment she went through with this family and was worth the outcome she experiences in life. \n\n3. Changing social classes is stressful. Does she feel like she fits into this school or does she feel like she\u2019s faking it all the time dealing with a bunch of entitled kids who know how to academically achieve and spend their parents money but have no idea what it is like to function in a lower middle class (or wherever she came from) world? Do you even know? She\u2019s learning how to code switch between the friends she has from her previous school and her world now- which is great- but at an age when you are trying to figure out who she is- it\u2019s a lot. \n\nSo she bitches about the skirt. And frankly, they are a sexist relic when it comes to school uniforms and a source of endless bitching and moaning from female Catholic/private school survivors the world over. (My friends lit theirs on fire.) What she\u2019s not doing is a whole list of teenage rebellion shenanigans that entitled kids with access to money tend to get into. Because if she was- this would be the least of your problems. \n\nLook- parenting kids is like having an investment account. When they are young and easy- all the time you put in nurturing and bonding with them- those are deposits. You build up a balance and when the challenging times come around the teen years- that\u2019s when you take out the withdrawals. Thing is- you weren\u2019t there to put the deposits in, and you are trying to take out withdrawals. And you don\u2019t have the balance with this kid to pull it off. Let your wife handle this stuff. You have only known your step-daughter for four years. You were your wife\u2019s choice, not hers.", "Is this a new private school stepdad troll? I feel like there have been a lot recently.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t have punished her without talking to your wife. And what sense does it even make to punish her for complaining?? She\u2019s complying with your do her own laundry rule. \n\nINFO: is this a religious private school? The only private schools near me are religious and they do have very similar uniform rules. It might not just be about the uniform, but about all the meanings and nuances behind it.", "Um... What exactly is she supposed to do when she gets home from school but change out of her uniform and into her regular clothes? And I ask this having grown up in the UK where uniforms were the norm for most schools at the time (don't know how much has changed but my old school still has them and they haven't changed since the late 70s). Changing when you get home is sensible, hygienic and the smart thing to do even when you love the uniform. I'm not trolling you, I really want to know what you expect her to do when she gets home.\n\nAnd I mean... Pants and then a skirt over them is just overkill as a school rule and absolutely not going to have any meaning in her adulting life.\n\nYou're right in having her do her laundry because at 17 it's time she learned, presumably she'll be going off to university in a year or two, but she's allowed to not like stupid rules and complain about them. Where's she going to complain except at home where she's supposed to be in a safe space, grounding her is just telling her she's not allowed to vent.\n\nShe's doing as she's been told, she's not breaking uniform rules in school because surely you would have immediately informed us of that, so she's obeying you and obeying the school.

You force her to attend a school that forces her to wear a skirt. You force her to have an extra chore because she attends said school. And you ground her for expressing frustration. \n\nAnd for the record, once she\u2019s 18, she will never have to wear a skirt again if she doesn\u2019t want to. You\u2019re being a dick.", "YTA. You aren't her parent. You shouldn't be punishing her at all, but this was certainly no hill to die on. It was a weird flex on your part. She's a teenager, a human being, with thoughts and feelings.

No student whose every had to wear a uniform for school leaves it on for a moment longer than necessary. Plenty of adults do this very same thing as well. Every other adult I know that has to wear a suit for work immediately changes to something like jeans or shorts and a t-shirt upon getting home.\n\n>This is a bit of a pain for us because of the extra laundry,\n\nBecause you might have to do 1 extra load? Doing the laundry is not difficult and doing 1 more load, if that's even required is extremely minimal in total effort or even time required.\n\n>so we had her start doing her own laundry as a condition of changing when she gets home\n\nHaving her do her own laundry because she's 17 would be reasonable. Forcing her to do it or not allowing her to change is overbearing as fuck.\n\n>The other day she was once again on a tirade about how much of a war crime it is that she wears a skirt, and I'd had enough. I grounded her for the next few days, and told her to stop complaining\n\nThis is a ridiculous overreaction. A better one, that would be a more positive learning experience would be to help her formulate an argument for why the uniform policy is unfair to present to the school board. That would be a lesson into how to properly handle complaints and might make the school experience better for plenty of other students.\n\nAll your reaction is going to do is make her hate you, her mom and especially hate the dress code even more because now it got her grounded as well.\n\n>but I don't think that justifies her being making a scene about it every day.\n\nShe has a right to complain about being uncomfortable.

Her entire life was uprooted, she was moved to a new school and your only complaint from a 17 year old is she hates her uniform?\nI get it can be annoying,  but let her bitch. Let her change (most kids do change after school so that's normal behaviour anyway) and let her voice her frustrations without reprimand as long as shes not screaming about them. Shes still young, growing and maturing...stop expecting her to just accept everything as peachy keen when you and her mom are the reason shes struggling to begin with. Yes you did what's right for your family and yourselves...but she still had her whole life uprooted and changed. That's a trauma for alot of people, especially teenagers. Very happy shes only bitching over a torture suit and not sneaking out every night in rebellion. It's all about perspective and understanding. Try seeing hers, remember being 17 and imagine how she felt and could still be feeling. If shes well behaved, gets decent grades and is respectful to her parents I dont see why she cant have this one thing to want to rebell against.\n\nBut also, fuck uniforms.

The girl will be unsettled after so many moves, she's coping by moaning about her uniform, yes it's all the time and it will do your head in, but from what you've written if that's ALL you get in reponse, she's had to deal with a lot of changes to her that ADULTS have decided, you weren't doing too badly.\n\n\nI know you done the school thing as a better start for her, but again it's more and more change and did you all talk?\n\n\nThe school uniform policy is ridiculous btw and wearing a skirt all the time is cold quite often. Clammy and feels unsafe during those times of the month, I know from chucking my uniform in the wash it's \"that parts over for now and breathe\" guessing it similar for her.\n\nI often think what is minor to you will feature quite largely in her decision about what she thinks about you in the future \n\nThink you've blown it though.", "Yta she was happy in her old school you make it out like you've swept in and saved her from a life of poverty and she should be so grateful but actually you upended her entire life.

That\u2019s illegal gender discrimination. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to ask for help being treated equally and despite you looking down on her old school and moving her away from all of her friends and the classes she is accustomed to and dropping her in the middle of a place where they have likely all gone to school together since kindergarten she adjusted well and quickly and is comfortable enough with you to address it. \n\nabsolutely cannot believe that not only did you punish her for speaking out against something that would be considered illegal anywhere but ridiculous private schools AND made it worse by trying to insist that she wear something that deeply uncomfortable around the house where she should be comfortable and feel safe and punishing her further by forcing her to do laundry because it\u2019s inconvenient to you that she wears more than just her school uniform at any given time.

It's only creepier when you add in that you want her to wear her school uniform after school too, what's that about? It's pretty common for people to change out of their work clothes once they get home, either because they're less comfortable or to save wear & tear on their work clothes. You need to take ten steps back from this whole uniform discussion dude, because you are just veering all the way into creepy stepdad territory at breakneck pace. \n\nAlso, it's ridiculous that in the year 2023, educational institutions still exist that force girls to wear skirts as part of the uniform. If the boys can wear pants then why can't the girls, too? It's such a dumb, arbitrary rule, and honestly, punishing her just for complaining about it is absolutely draconian. She abides by the rule to attend the school of YOUR choice, you can at least let her gripe about it. Honestly, if the absolute worst thing this teenager has done is complain about having to wear a uniform, she sounds like a pretty damn good kid, and maybe you shouldn't ground her over something so inconsequential. \n\nYTA, btw", "YTA\n\nThese archaic school uniforms with women only being forced to wear skirts need to be overturned.

My high school was a very traditional, all girls school, but in the early 1990's they started letting us wear trousers/pants, and not with the downright weird stipulation of being still under a skirt. Many schools in the UK changed at around that time, often pupil led. So how about encouraging her to think of ways the school could be persuaded to change the dress code. There are numerous case studies from around the world that will show that it doesn't negatively impact on learning. There will also be information on the arguments that others have presented in the past that have worked. I bet there are other kids in the school feel the same way that would want to work together on this. \n\nHelp her be the change she wants to be in the world, be supportive, be constructive, this is an opportunity and you are blowing it. \n\nIf she got them to change the skills are going to look great on a college application.", "Wow they are so lucky you saved them from their home, school and friends.

Think about it from that perspective.\n\nIf he keeps asking the same stupid question every day, i.e. \"Why are you changing out of your uniform now\", he's going to get told she fucking hates it every day until it penetrates his impressively thick skull.\n\nLike seriously, think about it. She agreed to do her own laundry just so she could change. He probably thought that would make her concede the point and wear the uniform until bedtime instead of doing her own laundry. He's now angry that she didn't concede the point and is punishing her for it."]}
