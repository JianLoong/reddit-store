So some background: my BF and I have been together over a year and lived together since the beginning of the year. He doesn't hold down a job for more than a few weeks and has been through like 8 this year already. We are already rocky because of his attitude and not helping with finances when I've told him I need help. \n\nAITA: I'm looking at selling my house. I got my house in my divorce from my ex-husband and it's paid off.i have primary custody so he wanted me to keep it.  I want something different and a 3 to 4 bdrm instead of the 2 bdrm I have. I want to buy another house from the proceeds of this one. Either through using the money from it as a down or buying straight out. The problem is BF wants to be on the deed for the other house. He's not helping with bills as it is and he's not contributing any money to buy the next one. His mother is throwing a fit because I told him it's not happening I also think that's because she wants to move in and rent a room which I also said no to ( severe drinking problem) but now he's mad that I said no and that everyone said I'm being a bad person. ( Everyone being his mother and friend that doesn't like me anyway). We're not married and he wants to be someday but I don't. I've been down that road and am not in a hurry to do it again.

Absolutely do not put him on the deed. He wants to just be given half your house that you are buying for your family? WTF?", "NTA. Omg runnnnnn, girl, run!!!!!!!! Enjoy your new house ALONE!", "NTA.\n\nWhy are you with such a mooch?", "NTA, why should he be entitled to half of your house when he hasn't contributed anything? What does he actually bring to the table, because it sounds like he's just leeching off you.", "Let\u2019s look at this another way. Say your new house has $100k in equity: Would you be comfortable handing the bf $50k? What\u2019s to keep him from selling if he is on the deed?", "How is this even a question?! Major NTA. But you really should dump him & stop being an asshole to yourself & your children! Everyone you meet is either a blessing or a lesson. Time to realize he's a lesson & get our of that relationship!", "NTA and it would be foolish to put him on.", "Girl run. Just run. You know he's trouble and you thinks it's going to get better after adding him on the deeds.\n\nRUN!!!!!!", "NTA. Stay legally independent of him. If he gets into trouble and his name is on the house, you could lose your home. Keep your Financials separate. Please don't ever give him access to your bank accounts. It's your house, you're paying for it,  you're responsible for taxes and upkeep. Charge him rent if you like. Hire an attorney to keep him from pulling any shenanigans if ypu need to. And I'd rethink this relationship because he sounds like a mooch and a deadbeat instead of a functional adult who can be your partner.", "NTA\n\nit's not a reasonable request.  You don't just ask someone to give you half of a house after dating them for a year.  It would be extremely foolish to do so.", "NTA.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.\n\nHe wants equity for nothing.  That's not how ownership and assets work.\n\nHe apparently comes by his horribleness honestly, though.\n\nWhy are you still with him....?   There are much worse things than being alone: being with a sponge is one of them.", "NTA! Sooooooo NTA.  \n\nit\u2019s a trap and you are seeing that already. You know he has zero right to be on the deed.  You know he will somehow mess it up for you, maybe by moving his mother in.  Everything else is just manipulation on their part.  Please don\u2019t let them blind yourself to your instincts on this.  You don\u2019t owe him this by any stretch, either logically or emotionally. \n\nHonestly, with this behavior, it may be a good idea to take a break from him for a while\u2026.just to get a bit of breathing space so you can think about this relationship more clearly.  Like I read in another post a while back, he has the right to ask, but you have the right to say no\u2026and to do so safely.  Him getting mad about it is \ud83d\udea9", "NTA and you spelled \"boyfriend\" wrong...LEECH....hope he's your ex...does not work, entitled and runs to his Mommy when hes upset with you not agreeing to his insane demands....like literally ANYONE would be a better BF!!!!", "NTA. You\u2019re not going to marry him. No need to entertain his silly request. He\u2019s trying to use his family and friends to manipulate you. You\u2019re doing a disservice to yourself and your kids (you mentioned custody) if you stay in this relationship.", "NTA, why are you still with this leech? He sounds toxic and you sound like you are setting the bar way too low. You deserve so much better.", "Nta get a new house and leave the bf at the old one lol", "NTA.  It\u2019s only been a year, he doesn\u2019t really work.  Keeping him off the deed safeguards the house for your children, if god forbid, something happens to you.", "NTA\n\nNo, he does not automatically get on the deed. You aren't even married. Even if you were married. Being on the deed isn't automatic. If one partner is putting up all the financing and finances are separate.\n\nDo you think he in any way deserves your assets? He's just hoping to come up on free money. Ditch the guy. He'll always be a drain. If you have a kid with him, you'll have a kid and him to take care of.", "ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DO IT!\n\nDepending on the state you're in, he could prevent you from selling if he doesn't sign off on the deed in the future. In fact, I would consider keeping him off the deed even if you marry. It's your home - your asset.\n\nThis is not about being an AH, it's about taking care of yourself and not letting someone bully you. You are not an AH for standing up for yourself. \n\nDo you want to be with someone who is brow beating you into submission?\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Is this even a question?  You\u2019ve been dating a year, he contributes nothing to the relationship but wants half ownership of your biggest asset?  Of course you shouldn\u2019t put his name on it!  He\u2019s using you!  Why are you even with this guy?", "Hell no!\nWhy are you with a deadbeat with drinking issues when you have a kid?", "You\u2019re definitely NTA for not being willing to put him on the deed. However, **you** ***are*** **an asshole** **to yourself** for continuing to be with this person. You deserve better than this.", "NTA.\n\nDo.  Not.  Do.  This.", "NTA. It's your house and proceeds and he isn't contributing to it. Put your foot down. He drops this or you drop him.\n\nMove on.", "Info: what are you ages?", "NTA\n\nWhy would be be on the deed for the house you're paying 100% of?   Get yourself a better boyfriend.", "NTA. Whatever you, do NOT put him on the deed and don't let his mother move in, or you'll quickly find yourself kicked out of your own house.", "NTA. You don't need more \"children.\" That's all he's been so far and might be expecting a free ride in life. You're better off with a supportive partner who isn't trying to coerce you into something you don't wanna do.", "DO NOT PUT HIS NEED ON THE DEED OR ON BILLS OR ANY LEGAL DOCUMENTS. \n\nYes. I yelled at you! He has NO right to homeownership using your money. He\u2019ll have 50% ownership even if he never contributes a dime. Why would you do that to yourself or your kids?\n\nNTA. \n\nFurthermore, is this relationship really what you want? His mom seems to have a lot to say, even though there\u2019s nothing legally binding him to you.", "INFO:  What does he bring to the relationship that outweighs the fact that you already support him, he's at the least emotionally abusive, and is financially abusive, and is now trying to get ownership on half of your house?\n\nNTA for not putting him on the deed, but YTA if you don't kick the freeloader out.", "NTA. Hell, no. He's contributed and is contributing nothing. Nope. And yeah, you really need his mom. Not.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are T A for being in a relationship with this man and exposing your kids to a guy who treats you poorly and isn't productive.", "NTA! Your BF will not contribute with any money to buy the house or pay any bills so his request of having his name on the deed is unacceptable. Are you really sure you want to live with this guy?", "NTA. Under NO circumstances should you put his name on the deed. This is your home, not his. If he wants his name on the deed, he needs to come up with half the money upfront.", "NTA, of course", "NTA. Even if he was laying bills or rent NTA. If he isn't on the mortgage, he isn't on the deed. He is taking advantage.", " NTA. Why are you still with this guy?

Hahahah. \n\nNo. \n\nNTA. \n\nAnd I\u2019m adding my vote to everyone else saying he\u2019s a leech and you should dump his ass.", "NTA - Get rid of the bf and buy your house. Under NO circumstances add his name to the deed. He is not a responsible adult. My mom did that with an ex that contributed nothing, he got half and she could do nothing about it.

Not a good example to set for your kids.", "NTA, I\u2019ve seen messy situations and if you guys break up, you\u2019ll have some major issues to deal with.

He lives in your home, rent free. Why would you want to support a deadbeat?\n\n\nRespect yourself and dump this guy", "Nta. I would even say don't let him move in from the start. Wait a while, just so you cannlegally say you bought and occupied it before.\n\nYou dont want him to claim that you guys were common law partners and the house is \"marital property\"", "NTA. \"Over a year\" is not a long relationship and he shouldn't be making such a demand this early. Do not give him this much control over your situation. Once his name is on the deed he can tell his mom she can move in and you can't stop it.", "NTA. These two are cuckoos, and you're their mark. Get rid of the boy, and his mother will follow.", "NTA. DON'T DO IT.  A family friend did this. She and the boyfriend broke up eventually. He then sued her for half the value of the house, even though he had never paid a cent of it.  She fought him in court, but ultimately, the law was on his side.

What us he contributing?", "NTA\n\nHowever, I think you should check into common law property laws before you do this. If he starts living with you in the house after you purchase it for many years, he could be entitled to half if you all ever break up. Be careful. He sounds shady. He's already mooching off you so he will definitely try to take you to the cleaners if you ever try to kick him out.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely DO NOT put this man on the deed.  He is a leech, and his mother is as well.  They want him on so he can leech even more.  \n\nIf he is living with you and not working, that means you are letting him mooch off you.  Stop it. \n\nIf he wants to be on the deed to a house, he needs to get a job, save money, and buy his own house.", "NTA. I know two women that did this and had to buy out the BF. I suggest that you send Mr. Greedy on his way. If he wants a house, he can save and buy one himself.", "NTA.

Never in a million years should you do this.\n\nIf this is the hill he wants to die on, let him fucking die.", "Nta at all. Listen do not put his name one the new house oke. You will have to pag for everything while he does nothing. And there will be an time when you break up and he will claim half of your house. And you can do nothing about it. Also mayor red flag.
