So some background: my BF and I have been together over a year and lived together since the beginning of the year. He doesn't hold down a job for more than a few weeks and has been through like 8 this year already. We are already rocky because of his attitude and not helping with finances when I've told him I need help. \n\nAITA: I'm looking at selling my house. I got my house in my divorce from my ex-husband and it's paid off.i have primary custody so he wanted me to keep it.  I want something different and a 3 to 4 bdrm instead of the 2 bdrm I have. I want to buy another house from the proceeds of this one. Either through using the money from it as a down or buying straight out. The problem is BF wants to be on the deed for the other house. He's not helping with bills as it is and he's not contributing any money to buy the next one. His mother is throwing a fit because I told him it's not happening I also think that's because she wants to move in and rent a room which I also said no to ( severe drinking problem) but now he's mad that I said no and that everyone said I'm being a bad person. ( Everyone being his mother and friend that doesn't like me anyway). We're not married and he wants to be someday but I don't. I've been down that road and am not in a hurry to do it again. So I question... am I the asshole for not being willing to put him on the deed?\n\nEDIT*******\nSince everyone is asking.... I think I needed to hear it from others to make sure I wasn't overreacting... when we got together he had a stable job that he had had for years and was paying all his bills and seemed stable. Second, we moved in together it changed and he had to find a different job because I lived an hour and a half away. Then just never stayed in them. He lost his car this year cause I wouldn't pay for it. I think I just needed to see that I wasn't overreacting because I've been ready to end it for a bit.", "created_utc": 1668186857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysgmza/aita_for_not_being_willing_to_put_my_bf_on_the/", "score": 843, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus, they had just gotten out of a bad financial entanglement with their ex of the house that the two of them had bought together, and my partner said they never wanted to do that again, so even if had been in a position to help somewhat equally, they would not have wanted me to. \n\nAnd so, I am not on the deed, I do not help on the mortgage, the house is entirely theirs. I do help with the utilities and the household expenditures, but all of the big things that are specifically for the house proper, like major maintenance and improvements, are taken care of my by partner. \n\nAnd both of us are fine with this arrangement, your bf is out of line until and and unless 1. He can afford to be in 50-50 with you, and 2. You *want* him to be in in this 50-50 with you.", "Hell No!  NTA!  And ditch the hobosexual while you're at it.", ">The problem is BF wants to be on the deed for the other house. He's not helping with bills as it is and he's not contributing any money to buy the next one. \n\nThis right here is all I needed to hear.  NTA.", "NTA, he sees an easy mark.  Would he do the same for you?  If he's on the deed then you can't make him move out and he has the right to force a sell for easy money.  Run away as fast as you can!", "NTA. Do NOT put him on the deed! You will regret it! I promise you that.\n\nI honestly would not let him move in until he has a stable career. He will get squatters rights blah blah blah.", "You have to be fucking crazy to put him on the deed. NTA.", "NTA- this guy is a straight up loser and a mooch. Dump him because you\u2019re doing a grave disservice to yourself.", "I'm so glad you added that edit, it was worrying up until then!  A person wants to legally own half a house without paying or contributing, you've only been together a year, it's already rocky, and his mother wants to move?!  Sorry but it made me laugh how bad this is.  NTA x a million.", "When you move into the new house, do not let him move in!", "NTA\nDoes this even need to be said? This dude doesn\u2019t pay bills, can\u2019t hold down a job for long, and gets mad when his mother isn\u2019t allowed to live with him and his partner after only ONE YEAR!? Throw the whole man away OP, run and never look back.", "NTA - do not put that man on your house unless you want to lose it.", "DO NOT Do IT. NTA. I\u2019ve seen this done and it was a huge mess. And drop the grifting BF.", "You would be boo boo the fool if you put him on the deed.  I\u2019m trying to figure out why you are even with him.", "NTA Do not put him on the Deed. He needs to pay for half the house if he wants on the deed. You have to protect yourself and your children's future. Don't ever gamble with your children's financial security.\n\nYou owe BF nothing, he has earned nothing. He sounds like dead weight.", "NTA Sounds like you got yourself into a bad rebound situation with this boyfriend. People break up and bounce back from those all of the time. Have fun dating as a divorcee!", "NTA \n\nthe only way you would be the AH here is if you stay in a relationship with this loser. Do yourself a favour and save yourself future heartache and being used by ditching him", "NTA and regarding your edit: go ahead and end it. This internet stranger understands what you are going through.", "NTA\n\nAlso, you know it's hella lot easier to never let him move into the new place at all than to evict him once he's there, right?", "NTA leave the BF take the cannoli", "NTA, he's a loser that will take half your house and have his mom living there. No need for you to listen or even have a conversation about this with her. Just say to her, they can both go out and buy a house by themselves. \nGive him x amount he needs to pay a month towards monthly bills. He can't, well after you sell the house don't let him move into your new house.", "NTA. You are the Sugar Momma.", "NTA.  If he doesn't pay at least half, he doesn't go on the deed.  Period.", "Don\u2019t let him move in when you buy the new place.", "NTA Why are you with this guy? What does he bring to the table beside strife?  He is no help, I am sure you do nothing right according to him and he expects you to just take care of him. Take your child but you another house 1000miles away from this Yahoo.", "I was about to say everyone sucks, you for being with that leech and even thinking for a second your a bad person for not allowing him on the deed, then I read your edit..so NTA and get rid of him asap.", "NTA but Y T A to yourself if you don\u2019t just end this already and send the entitled bum back to his mommy. I\u2019d get him out now before he sabotages your home sale. What value does he add to your life besides a warm body so that you\u2019re not physically alone?", "DO NOT PUT HIS NAME ON ANYTHING AND GET RID OF HIM NOW.", "RUNNNN \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 NTA. Leave him.", "Run run run run run. And when you\u2019re done run some more", "NTA! Do NOT do this. Week 1 in law school we are told this is a huge money maker for use because it only works 30% of the time and the rest of the time its a legal battle. According to my law prof getting a house with your SO without being married or qualifying  in common law is one of the stupidest things you can do. Marriages have a divorce rate of 60% and 9/10 romantic relationships fail. Dont do it!", "NTA, please don\u2019t add him. As soon as you break up, you\u2019ll either have to buy him out or sell and he gets 50% even though he\u2019ll attribute negative money (he\u2019ll keep spending your money while attributing nothing)", "Yeah. It won't matter if he is on deed or not, momma will be moving in. Get rid of him before that happens.", "That is not how common law marriage works at all.", "Read this, OP!!!", "Don\u2019t do it even if you\u2019re married!", "So much this. Best comment.", "By it lock down, you mean stop sleeping with a leech altogether,  right?", "Why are you with this dolt? He\u2019s a grifter. Do not let him move in. Work on your self esteem.", "I am taking notes", "You are a rare gem Jilltro. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "This is the truest thing I've ever seen. Well put!!", "Info- Are you kids still with you? He's a shitty role model and will take half your money and move his mom in. You can do better.", "Oh honey, cut bait and throw that one back in. There are lots of fish that have working parts.", "Kick him out, and for the love of whatever you find holy, don\u2019t be moving men you\u2019ve just been dating a few months into your house with your children in it!", "Jaja. Great advice for OP. NTA at all. Do not put him in the deed to your house. Wtf. The answer is obvious.", "Lol. Please take my poor person award: \ud83c\udfc6", "I died \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d best reply everrrr!", "\ud83d\ude02", "\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I love this", "Yo, but apparently he's not even giving any richard. Like no redeeming qualities", "Jesus, NTA, and under no circumstances put his name on ANYTHING. The whole family is trying to take advantage of you. Run. Run fast.", "NTA. Everything is in your name because you are paying for everything. That man doesn't deserve to share property that he hasn't invested any money in.", "NTA\n\nHim and his mother r traping u, he want to own something which he does not have right. The house is ur and it should be only ur name on deed of new house coz its baught by ur own money. That mother and son are using u for their selfish reasons. \n\nIdu why u even with such a man who dosnt do job, dont pay rents, bills and demanding his name on something he dosnt own. Hes not just looser he might even scam u in future. \n\nLeave this guy without thought before u rue the day u met this man.", "Never jeopardize the roof over your child's head.\n\nNEVER.", "Dump this guy NOW.  Bad news.  If you don't find a way to get him out of your house RIGHT NOW, he could create a situation where he sabatages your sale (for instance making a mess right before a showing).   Talk to an attorney if you have to.", "NTA get rid of them both!", "OP, you should reread your own post. Or have a friend read this OUT LOUD.\n\nagain and again. Slowly. Clearly. Then ask yourself, \"why am i with this fool?\"\n\nNTA", "Why are you living with someone you\u2019ve known less than a year, letting him be around your kids, and letting him take advantage of you financially? How long have you been living together if he was in a stable job when you met and has gone through 8 this year?", "Some of these questions are just too silly to take seriously.  \"AITA because I won't put my lazy good for nothing boyfriend on the deed of my house?\"  I mean seriously?", "NTA,  and sounds like from your update,  you realize that and may be ready to move on from this relationship.   I think that's a wise decision.", "NTA\n\nWhat on earth does he think gives him the right to be on the deed of your new house when he hasn't contributed a cent towards it? There's some huge entitlement right there.\n\nDon't put him on the deed. Ask him to pay his fair share of things. If he can't maybe he can move in with his mother instead.", "Putting him on the deed is the same as gifting him half the value of the house.  And he can break up with you and force a sale and walk away with that money the next day. Do you want to gift him that money?", "Plz break up w him NTA", "NTA He wants your assets because he can't or won't build any of his own. Protect your future. Move on without him as you know what he's like now.", "NTA and please dump this loser. Tell him to go live happily ever after with his mommy and they can stay home & pound back drinks all they want- he ain't driving anymore since you sensibly refused to lay for his car (wise choice). He can't even lay for a car- so most likely he'll never pay his fair share for a house.", "NTA. You would be to yourself if you did and if you stay with him. My fianc\u00e9 and I got a house together after about a year but we both have jobs and contributed to the down payment. If you broke up you\u2019d be screwed.", "You\u2019re not overreacting and you already know the solution to your situation. NTA", "Definitely NTA!! He\u2019s a bum and wants you to put his name on YOUR house so that if you split up, you\u2019ll have to sell the house and give him half. You deserve better.", "NTA. But you will be an idiot if you put him on the deed to your children\u2019s home, let his mother move in with you, or him. But that comes from a place of love. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s going to do what he needs to, and is trying to take from you. I\u2019ve watched my sister in a similar situation and I reallllly hate it. I wish you luck", "INFO: you don\u2019t really need us for this one do you? Re-read your post - your bf isn\u2019t responsible enough to take care of a goldfish \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. Definitely don\u2019t put him on the deed. It sounds like instead you might want to buy a new house and not allow him to move into it at all.", "I guffawed, I tell you", "This made my night\u2026I\u2019m going to sleep with a smile on my face\ud83c\udf7b"]}
