We\u2019ll call them R(28f) J(26m) &M(21f).So i am getting married in June and have been engaged for a year.\n\nMy older sister R and I have had our ups and downs but my parents raised me to keep the peace.  When I got engaged R had a meltdown and was upset because she wanted to be married first.\n\nBack in February R\u2019s boyfriend came to my house and asked my parents if he could marry my sister. We were all really happy, and just had to wait for him to pop the question.\n\nNow before my sister got engaged her fiance told R he wanted to be married in September. So she started planning the wedding without the engagement because she thought he\u2019d ask soon. \n\nSo in May R gets engaged and when she returns home from her trip she doesn\u2019t say anything to me. She decides she wants to be married in October 2022.\n\nWithin the 4 months of my sisters engagement she told my M, J, and my parents that \u201cI\u2019ve had my turn to be engaged\u201d \u201cthat no one should talk about my wedding because hers is more important\u201d. Once I heard these thing I told my parents I need some space from the wedding planning and for all of our sanity that I would not be too involved in her wedding.\n\nFast forward to the big dayR ignores me, M, and mom and spent all her time and love with her new in-laws. She made me feel like I didn\u2019t belong and that I wasn\u2019t even her sister. I felt like a leper, but I kept saying \u201cit\u2019s almost over\u201d. \u201cI want her to be happy\u201d.\n\nThen came the real problem \u201cI want the ladies to get on the dance floor\u201d she said\nR turns around and goes to throw the bouquet, but instead turns around and says \u201cnow that I\u2019m married, now you can have your turn\u201d. And gives me the bouquet.\n\nAll I wanted to do was cry and scream, but I kept it inside, and accepted the bouquet. She hugged me and I said \u201cI hope you\u2019ve had the wedding of your dreams. The rest of the night I felt sick  as everyone talked to me about how nice it was. I put the bouquet in R\u2019s bag and left to go home.\n\nLater on at night with my parents, some family and my fianc\u00e9 the topic came up. My mom said that if R asked why I gave the bouquet back she would tell her that I loved the gesture but I thought she should keep her bouquet. \nI told my mom that I in fact hated the gesture, and I called think about was her saying \u201cnow that I\u2019m done weddings are no long important so I guess you can get married\u201d. \n\nMy dad preceded to yell at me, and tell me that I always turn things in a negative way regarding R. I tired to appeal to him logically and reminded him that I did as I was told and took it like a champ. I told him we\u2019d have to agree to disagree and I left.\n\n\nNow my parents think that I\u2019m taking it to far and I should just forget about it.

It\u2019s your wedding which means you get to choose who is in it. Just be prepared for the backlash, even if it isn\u2019t deserved. Your sister is obviously the golden child, which means no matter what you say or how much you argue your point, they are still going to side with her."]}
