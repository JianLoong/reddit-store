I feel for you, it sounds like really annoying behavior and it would drive me absolutely bonkers. But in this instance, I feel like it would be kind of asshole behavior to not let the friends in, since they weren\u2019t the one\u2019s telling you they weren\u2019t coming and may have no idea of this conflict. I\u2019m going to go with NAH, except for your parents for doing this to both of you. I\u2019d let them in and maybe see if you can go to therapy with your sister to see if they have any ideas on how to break this behavior of hers.", "INFO\n\nWhy not just order more food than needed?\n\nIf she has such a pathological difficulty with telling you about this kind of thing, perhaps saying \"I've ordered more food just in case you decide to invite your friends last minute\".\n\nTake away pizza can be frozen and reheated in the oven another time if you're concerned about food waste. Other food I'm not sure about but I know you can do that with most pizza.\n\nAlso, would it help to ask her psychologist about things you could do to help her understand that she's safe to tell you the truth about food she's eaten or clothes she's borrowed?\n\nSo far I'm leaning towards NAH as my vote", "If you tell her your plan in advance, YWNBTA. Otherwise, you would.", "Plan for Ellie.  It's one person.  If she doesn't come it's no big deal.  Honestly, I kind of feel like the way you are approaching this probably feels a bit to her like your parents shadow is hovering over you too, and it might be.  Are you discussing this stuff or are you just talking at her?  She seems to retreat into a shell when she feel confronted.  Your frustration is possibly coming off as anger and making her pull away even more.  What if you just told her you were going to add 4 people to your planning for her to add some friends.  You could tell her, \"I'm adding 4 to the number off people I am planning for so you can invite some friends.  Just let me know if you go over that number so I can adjust.\"  then leave it at that.  No pressure.  If she doesn't invite anyone ... do it again next time.  She's been trained her whole life to act a certain way.  You cannot expect to undo that learned behavior so quickly.  Especially when you are putting pressure on her and that reminds her of your parents.  You guys are trying to both adjust to life away from your parents and out of their reach.  Be patient with each other.  NTA for how you feel, but YWBTA if you just don't let her friends in.  She will see you as your parents.  Is that who you want to be?", "It sounds like your sister has some profound mental health issues around security of possessions, personal space, and speaking up for herself.\n\nI'm guessing that when you show annoyance, press your sister for a Yes/No answer, ask her to \"fess up\" for borrowing something, or give her an ultimatum or deadline, she *goes passive:* flop or freeze response. This may have helped her survive your parents' home, but it's extremely irritating behaviour in a roommate and I feel for you.\n\nShe's only been out of your parents' home for a couple of years -- you've been out for four. So she's lagging way behind you in healing and turning into a fully autonomous adult. Hopefully she'll get there (psychotherapy is good!) but it may take a while yet.\n\nMaybe you could adapt your expectations and tactics a bit, OP -- like, have some extra bags of snacks around in case Ellie shows up, and keep your dealings with your sister as mellow and calm as you can. One or two more guests at a party is not the end of the world, eh? Praise her on the occasions when she speaks up for herself. Also, put a lock on your bedroom door if you are totally fed up with her pinching your clothes, and that's that.\n\nYWBTA if you flex, bar her friends at the door, and pile more shame and upset onto your sister. Sounds like she's already had a lifetime of that. I'm sure you are a better brother than to continue it.", "NAH. Your sister is obviously dealing with a major trauma due to your childhood and she's battling to get out of these habits. These things don't change overnight and they require patience. You however are also doing your best to create a safe space and are within your rights to get annoyed. I personally would rather just count on Ellie being there and I wouldn't act on the threat personally. She'll get there. Besides, you can never have too much pizza.", "NAH. You sisters has issues and needs help. Maybe you're being too authoritative and it's triggering her to react like she did around parents. She needs help. Therapy - maybe you can go with her to it. Get some extra pizza in anyway and let her have her friends over. A normal social thing will be good for her.", "NAH. Keep in mind the habits she has took 18 years to build. It's a lot to overcome.", "NAH. Honestly it sounds like your sister is still processing the trauma from her childhood. What happened when she disobeyed your parents? Seems like she\u2019s still stuck in the mindset of not being free and having to hide stuff. Maybe your sister would allow you to go to her counseling session so you can have a better idea of what she is dealing with mentally and how to help her through the healing process.", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t let her friends in. \n\nYou guys grew up with strict parents. And they were harder on her. \n\nI also grew up with extremely strict parents. \n\nYou learn to lie. And lying is a hard habit to outgrow because you still worry there will be consequences. \n\nIt took me 5 years of being out of parents house to outgrow that habit. And even then, sometimes I still fall in it about stupid little things. \n\nTherapy will help her eventually. But just let her friends come by and start \u201cpunishing\u201d her over the stupid little things - like not mentioning the food or the sweaters.", "Overall, NTA. I get it, constantly being kept out of the loop on purpose is not fun, especially considering it's your stuff and your money.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that this is a trauma response for her due to your parents. It is VERY hard to break conditioning set up over 18 years. I highly suggest both of you going to see a counselor about this, and for her a therapist.\n\nFor the upcoming get together, allow the friends in but definitely have a talk with your sister. Explain why you're upset, try to keep from sounding accusatory. It's hard AF having the conversation but it needs to be done. Good luck!", "YWBTA\n\nIt's her home as well and you can't tell her she's not allowed to invite friends into *her* home. It would be fair to say that she would need to order extra pizza or provide her food but actually preventing them from entering? Nope.", "I get the frustration, but she clearly has some mental health issues she is struggling with. You can try to make a point with the knowledge that it may make thing worse or you can just assume she is coming and order a bit more pizza. Worst case scenario is you have leftovers for the next day. YTA", "YWBTA if you don't let your sister's friends in without giving them a chance to explain themselves. While it's understandable that you're frustrated with your sister's behavior, it's not fair to punish her friends for something they may not have any knowledge of. Instead, you should talk to your sister and try to work out a solution to the underlying issue. Maybe you can come up with a system where she has to ask for permission before taking your things or eating your food, and if she doesn't follow the rules, then there will be consequences. But don't take your frustration out on her friends who may not have done anything wrong.", "NTA. You need an accurate count of guests to your party so that you can purchase enough food, drinks, and other party supplies. You have told her, repeatedly, that she needs to tell you who she is inviting for that purpose. If she lies, she has no one to blame but herself (for lying) if the consequence is that you don't have enough for her friends to join. I would give her one last chance to give you an accurate count. And then, the consequences of an undercount are her responsibility.", "YWBTA - your sister is getting the help she needs to work through her trauma. Therapy is not the magicical 1.session and everything is perfect. 2 years in,  she is still learning. Are you also seeing a therapist to work through your trauma from your family? Are you working together with a therapist to help with healing together? She had it worse than you and you admitted it. She needs to fully know you are a safe space and not like your parents. When you ask her questions or get frustrated, does it come out like how your parents reacted? Or is it more passive aggressive? Your sister goes into her flight mode often still so some self reflection on your end might help negate those for some good conversations. \n\nI get you are frustrated. It sucks,  but your sister needs support. She needs to feel safe. I might even stop commenting on the food or friends over \"behind your back\" for a while. Let her see it does not bother you. You can always check and see what is in the fridge. Or do weekly grocery shopping together. That way, she can speak up in a positive interaction vs her scared one she has.", "Ywbta\n\nShe lives there too and you're her brother not her dad. If they were bringing in someone who was potentially hazardous or dangerous it'd be different though. \n\nAlso this is not likely to have the results you want. Instead it will make her more likely to hide things from you since you'd be causing her severe emotional distress over it. You'd be positioning yourself as an authority figure, like your parents, and that's why she's acting like this to you.", "YWBTA\n\nI understand this is a profoundly irritating situation for you. But your current tactic of \"just tell me\" isn't working.\n\nSo change your tactic up. If you think your sister might want something, provide it without asking her if she wants it. Let her get used to the idea that what she needs *will be there*. It might help her get out of the deprivation mindset.\n\nAnd do make sure she keeps going to the psychologist.", "YWBTA you're just doing to her what your parents did to her, you're acting like her dad and not her sibling and it's not fair, she's obviously dealing with some major trauma, i don't know what it was like in your family but most abused kids do have issues with hiding things so i'm betting that it's coming from the same place psychologically", "Hmm. I'm going with WYBTA but it's understandable. It sounds like she has some complex needs. I'm glad she's going to a psychologist and I strongly recommend you also have communication with that psychologist. You might have your own issues, but also you need to get on the same page about what's acceptable and what's not at home. Stealing things is tough and tricky. It's obviously learned behaviour from traumas but it's not as easy to just turn that off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe may not even understand that what she's doing is wrong. Which is why talking to her psychologist might help. They could be limited with that they can say, but you'll find that out quickly. But this seems like a casual party. There's nothing wrong with ordering extra food and giving an open invitation. Her issues might make it tough for her in this space too somehow. If you end up with too much though, that's not the end of the world.", "YWBTA.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re wanting her to absolutely commit to plans.

I know it's hard, and it's not fair that that burden falls on you, but it sounds like you love her a lot and do want to make this work. \n\nIn the interim of her getting better, you could try short term solutions to the issues you're facing at the moment. If she has trouble verbalising when she has finished some food, could you put up a black board in the kitchen for a shopping list, and just ask her to add whatever she has finished onto the black board list. For the jumper problem, you could say 'I don't mind if you borrow jumpers from x draw, and put them in the communal washing basket once you're done, however the jumpers in y draw are the ones I use for work/dates/whatever, so please do not borrow these specific ones'.\n\nOf course the goal in the end is for her to no longer feel the need to hide things and to be able to properly communicate with you, it's just going to take time. \n\nIf her friend does turn up to the party, in this instance I would just let it go, and afterwards have a calm discussion about some ways you could both improve things going forward. \n\nTruly wishing you both the best!", "Nta.

You won't eat any of them (buy yourself he same and keep in room if it'll help convince her that you won't take any of these). Then tell her she is free to eat any or all of them, but she has to start to work on letting you know she took them.\n\nMaybe vocalizing is too scary. Maybe have a chalkboard or a piece of paper stuck to the pack with the number 12. And when she takes one, she has to subtract one from the total. \n\nMaybe something like this could help her \"admit\" she's taking food without having to face you directly about it.\n\nI am so sorry that your parents were so awful. Please be patient with her. She's healing, slowly.", "Her nervous system doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s safe yet", "NTA. But you care for your sister so if Ellie comes, you\u2019ll let her in. Considering she\u2019s currently in treatment I\u2019d say this particular scenario isn\u2019t the right hill to die on. If she still sucks at telling the truth when time has passed and therapy has ended, then you can die on that hill.", "I wonder if she needs a different way to express it - does she fear punishment for verbally expressing it, but might be able to tick a box on a whiteboard indicating how many friends are coming?? Clearly she has complex trauma going on - perhaps working in a different way of communicating things to you will help her.", "Unfortunately it's not just about the food or this specific incident. Also AITA isn't the right sub for this.", "You recognize she had it worse growing up \u2014 and that's just from the maltreatment you were actually privy to. There could've been another layer as well.\n\nIt's rough, but your survival mechanisms were clearly borne of different expectations, and despite your good intentions, this approach doesn't seem to be working. \n\nCan you go to family therapy together?", "What about changing the phrasing?  Tell your sister that You want to invite Ellie and a few of her friends over because You want them there. \n\nIt could be good to emphasize that you want her to be happy, and you are willing to help her needing to be afraid.   She can\u2019t \u201cget in trouble\u201d if you did the inviting.", "If your sister can, she should get a job to have money to contribute, such as buying food to replace what she eats, or contributing to the party costs when including her friends  If she is not in a position to work, does she have access to some money to be able to go and just replace the food without having to discuss it with you.. If you are providing all of her living expenses, she probably feels guilty for being a burden. This can then trigger her lying about finishing something, because she is faced, each time, with being a burden to you. She has been conditioned not to take, that conditioning will take time to break. \n\nPut up a white board that you both write shopping list items, and let her go do the shopping. If it's only sweaters she is borrowing, set up a sweater shelf in a shared space- linen closet, coat closet, bathroom- that she isn't going into your bedroom to access. That probably triggers her hiding behavior because she entered your private space to get the sweater. Finding ways to give her permission, within her mind, to occupy space by working around the triggers can help her overcome them, and help relieve your frustration that she isn't getting better quicker.", "NTA. This is a very simple request. I understand y'all had a shitty childhood but she's got to learn. If you keep catering to her you won't be doing her any favors.", "NAH. As another child of abuse I feel for you guys. In my case my sisters and I refuse to accept any gifts or financial support in any circumstance because we always feel like we\u2019re burdens to others. Something we\u2019re all trying to get out of, and all collectively get annoyed with each other for despite the fact all three of us take part in this. Your sister is working through trauma and she needs time. It doesn\u2019t go away after one conversation. Let her be as secretive as she needs but continue assuring her you\u2019ll never be mad.", "Or sister can just be honest. This is something very simple. OP can't spend the rest of his life coddling his sister. He has to say rules for her to adhere to and if she doesn't there are consequences.", "I think it's very likely you have no experience of trauma at this level. What you wrote is akin to saying to an anorexic \"why don't you just eat? You'll die if you don't eat\".", "You are right if it\u2019s only one person.NTA.", "Hey stranger, first I just want to say NAH. Reading this broke my heart over and over and reminded me of my own controlling parents. My response was similar to your sisters- hide, deny, deflect; essentially freeze or flop as others have noted. When you're coming from a space where everything you do is questioned, monitored, and interrogated by authority figures (and by this I mean those who have financial control over you), it's hard to hear similar questions and not react with the same flop/freeze response. I know your questions arent coming from the same place as your parents' questions; you know your questions aren't about controlling her actions but about keeping your lifestyle smooth and efficient. Unfortunately, she might not be able to hear your questions outside of the context of her trauma. This isn't your fault, or her fault. \n\nI'm trying to think of strategies that would've helped me when I was fresh out of my parents house. Have you considered less direct ways of addressing the problems? For example, rather than ask her to tell you when she finishes off the orange juice, maybe keep a white board on the fridge where she could write \"out of OJ\" or something. More than anything she needs to feel she has power over her own space and life. Have you considered giving her a mini fridge for her room and giving her money to stock it with whatever she wants? Think of it this way- when you moved away from your parents, you moved into your own space. When she moved out from your parents, she moved into her siblings space. She may not be able to fully heal until she gets a true space of her own, which may involve moving out. \n\nId also like to add support for getting therapy for yourself. You were both in the same traumatic environment- you deserve to heal from it too.", "NTA. Maybe she is worried her friend/s will cancel at the last time after you already buy the pizza?", "Also why not consider inviting your sister's friends too and tell sister \"I know you are having trouble deciding whether you should invite your friends or not, so I've extended an invitation from my end\"\n\nWould this work? Or will it be considered crossing a boundary?", "I feel upset reading this as it brought back horrible memories of what I was like when I was recovering from having an abusively controlling parent. I lied like I breathed and trusted nobody. I got therapy and it helped, but I spent nearly ten years learning first to be honest, then learning that not all truths were good to tell, and finally acquiring tact. I couldn't let anyone too close as I was so afraid they would hurt me.\n\nI'm so glad you are there for your sister and that she is in therapy. You sound like a great brother. \n\nI got over it in the end, but it's hard to recover from having your identity and all your choices attacked by the very people who are supposed to be on your side, your own family. I hope your sister makes it out and she can rebuild herself from the broken pieces into someone she wants to be.", "Does your sister struggle with basic adulting things like grocery and clothes shopping? Does she have a job as and her own money? (No judgement if she's not there yet).\n\nI'm thinking that when you moved out, you were on your own. You could do what you wanted, buy the food you wanted, invite friends over, etc. without having to check in with someone else or get permission. I imagine that went a long way toward helping you feel like a free person with your own autonomy. Your sister hasn't had that. She moved in with you and even if you give her whatever she wants, she probably still feels like a scared kid again having to ask. Not that you are doing anything wrong, it's just sort of the default dynamic when you move into someone else's space. \n\nI'm wondering if she could do some of the shopping herself, so when something runs out she doesn't have to report it to you (or even keep a list on the fridge door that she can add to without asking directly). Or you could give her a bit of cash to go to the mall with friends and get a new hoodie. Or involve her in things like party planning so she has input on the guest list as a host, not as a guest bringing extra guests. Things like that could help empower her to feel like an equal in your home and gain a bit of her own autonomy.", "My upbringing wasn't this bad, but I still reflexively hide information from my parents. I was a good kid (bit mouthy, but still) who was raised under constant suspicion that I might be doing something \"wrong.\" \n\nIn retrospect I understand that this had little to do with me, but stemmed from my parents' bad marriage and my mom's unmanaged anxiety disorder. But it has made me ... private, at best. Shame-ridden at worst.", "NAH I don't know how to help your sister, but setting reasonable rules and boundaries is a reasonable thing to do.", "NTA. Order pizza as if none of her friends are coming and tell her. I ordered enough for...if anyone else shows up send away. Perhaps she needs a different doctor too", "Whatever you choose, you\u2019re a good person and your sister is lucky to have you.", "I would encourage you, if you know who her therapist is, to send her therapist a letter outlining your concerns about her hiding things from you and whatever. Maybe let the therapist know that your sister could use some assistance, developing some coping mechanisms regarding this issue.  You are absolutely NTA.  Childhood trauma sucks.", "NTA. But you should not be living with her. She needs her own place.", "I understand that to live together you have to tell each other about stuff and I would be annoyed as hell. Maybe she needs a wake up call, but not this one.\nDon\u2019t just consider your sister consider her friends too. Imagine you where invited to a party, dressed up, traveled awhile and were send back at the door. It would suck and you would be the A H. \nTalk to here and make the consequences clear. For example: \u201cI want you to tell me when you eat stuff. If you don\u2019t I will have to look the food away.\u201d I mean there should be food she can eat just not the stuff she really wants. Maybe that helps but don\u2019t harm innocent bystanders.\n(I realize food may be a bad example, maybe try it with something less important first.)", "You said yourself your sister had it way harder than you did. \nShe\u2019s deeply traumatised. \nNAH", "NAH. Keep in mind the habits she has took 18 years to build.", "NAH. You sisters has issues and needs help. Maybe you're being too authoritative and it's triggering her to react like she did around parents. She needs help.", "Overall, NTA. I get it, constantly being kept out of the loop on purpose is not fun, especially considering it's your stuff and your money.", "You have no idea WTF I've been through, survived and fight against daily. I know exactly WTF I wrote and stand by my opinion. Something as simple as saying \"yes my friend is coming\" should be respected if they want there to be accomodations for them. If OP spends the rest of his life letting her pull this kind of stuff he does her zero favors. He shouldn't have to order extra food because his sister can't say yes."]}
