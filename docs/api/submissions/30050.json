I\u2019m diplomatic enough to tell my kids (who are close to their cousins) not to ever talk about Steve or my mom. Just be kind. We get a cake because I know SIL has it rough with her 4 kids and previously she was a SAHM. It was a good party and my kiddo\u2019s had a lot of un playing video games with our cousins. \n\nI talk to my mom on the phone and she calls me a traitor saying Steve was hurt that I went. I tell my mom to stop enabling Steve and she too could have a relationship with her grandkids again. I reminded her of what Steve did and how he\u2019s not working so he doesn\u2019t pay child support and mom is ok with supporting that. \n\nI told my mom it\u2019s her choice from being ostracized from the family because she\u2019s already babying a grown ass man. \n\nMom is worrying because Steve has no support that he will off him and we\u2019ll all feel guilty if that happens. I told my mom I don\u2019t feel sorry at all for what Steve is going through and he\u2019s not the victim here just a deadbeat father and how (mom) is just as bad for enabling him. \n\nMom is now not talking to me because I have turned my back on Steve and I'm supporting his ex. I'm also being disrespectful to my mom.

IMO in situations like this the main consideration should be the children involved. Based on your account it sounds like you were just being a good, supportive aunt and that's awesome. Your brother, on the other, is a full blown AH. You never detailed what the \"argument\" was about but based on how you're writing about him it sounds like it was probably something he did and now he's making his kids suffer in an effort to get revenge on his ex. He needs to man up, realize that his main responsibility is to his children, get off his ass and start looking for work. As far as I know every state has offices that are specifically tasked with helping people find work, for free.

So I am going to make some presumptions. I am trying to be fair though.  \n\n\nThe way \"argument\" was phrased sounded like possible DV. That's rhetorical. I know people might not want to go into that for a lot of reasons. So I can understand why you might try to help his ex wife and their children. And why you might be annoyed with your mother for helping and supporting him.  \n\n\nI think (again presuming, which is really all I can do, online) your mother is terrified he will harm himself. I think she is sincere in saying that. Who knows what he has told her or done to make her believe that. And to be ultra fair: Maybe he really has been that depressed. About what, doesn't really signify in this point, because, that's *her* child, and she's afraid. So she's thinking with her emotions.  \n\n\nIf she believes anything less than full support might result in that, she has concluded she could not live with herself, so she is giving her full support, 'right or wrong.'  \n\n\nI do not think you should be ostracized for choosing differently.   \n\n\nIt is a sad situation all around. Enabling might be stringing him along from pulling himself together or he might be clinically depressed and or abusing substance/self medicating that way. Which only compounds a lot of issues, including, being able to hold down employment.  \n\n\nHe should be paying something in child support.   \n\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA, you hit the nail on the head. He's become a deadbeat, mom is enabling him. Gross behavior and shame on both of them for abandoning those kids.", "NTA.   You nailed!!!   Deadbeat dad.  How would your mom feel if your in-laws did the same thing to you, and left you and your kids to struggle?   Your mom needs to treat your bro like an adult, not her baby boy.   That went out the window when he his babies were born.", "NTA\n\nI think you were perfectly right in what you'd aid to your mom. You can't play the victim when you are not.", "NTA.\n\nYou're absolutely right. Steve is a deadbeat and his mother is enabling him. If she were so worried about his mental state enough to put it out there she's worried about him being suicidal, then shouldn't she be seeking intervention for him? No, Mama's baby boy doesn't want to be a responsible parent and husband and she is holding him up in his wrongdoing. The terrible part about it is that she expects others to be on his side to the injury to his children? Your mom is so, so wrong in this.", "NTA Your mother *is* an enabler. Clearly she only cares about your brother, and I bet you and your kids are just as disposable as Steve's children.", "NTA! \n\nIn fact you sound incredibly sane, and great to have around. I am sure that your brother ex and his children really could use that support and kindness that you are offering. Regardless of anything else, not working to withold legally entitled money to his spouse makes him a big steaming AH.", "Info -  by an 'argument'  do you mean he physically abused her?", "NTA. You\u2019re supporting your nieces and nephews. They\u2019re the innocent ones in all of this. Your brother is acting like an AH and a deadbeat. How is your mother ok with him harming his kids?", "NTA\n\nMaybe be a bit kinder to your mom. Steve, while an asshole and a deadbeat, is still her son.  Though you aren't wrong.", "Yta. He owes his wife nothing. Good idea not having a job so his money won't be stolen to give straight to someone who hates him.", "Good. Your mom IS an enabler. Actions have consequences- NTA", "NTA  It always helps when the trash takes itself out!", "NTA \n\nYou sound like a good man, good dad, and a good uncle. \n\nGood I mean great \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA\n\nYou are right, you said it correctly and your Mom can suck it.", "It's a pretty easy choice between supporting a deadbeat father and supporting his kids.\n\n\"Support me in hurting my kids or I'll do something drastic\" indicates his logic and reason has gone right out the window.\n\n\"I'd strongly prefer you don't do something drastic but I am not going to stop doing the right thing,\" is about the only reasonable response, given the facts as presented.\n\nIf he does do something drastic, that's on him and only him.", "Not just a deadbeat -   based on OP's use of the \"argument\" euphemism I think it's very likely that he physically assaulted his wife.", "This 1000%. My father's mother was like this. Her precious son could do no wrong, and my mother was the devil because she dared to divorce him. My dad paid little to no support when we were kids, and my grandmother didn't care.\n\nShe also resented us kids as the living reminder that her son was a deadbeat. She died when I was 13. I still refuse to visit her grave - 40 years later. I have nothing good to say about her. Only 2 of my siblings acknowledge her, the other feels as I do. We've all forgiven my dad, who's worked to make amends. My grandmother - she can rot.", "Reddit wouldn\u2019t let me say but yes and he turned around and blamed it on the stress for the whole 2020 situations while they was stuck together every day. He\u2019s awful.", "He blamed it on the stress of the 2020 layoffs and being stuck with his wife and kids all day with nothing to do. Reddit flagged the original post.", "Ah that makes sense why you didn't fully spell that out.", "Wow, your brother is trash, sorry to say.  And your mom wants to support someone who did that?! The excuses don\u2019t matter!  I understand not wanting to abandon your child, but to then act like you\u2019re the bad guy for still having a relationship with his wife after what HE did?  She\u2019s no better.", "You are being respectful to those you should be respectful to. He is an AH and your mom is enabling him way too much. NTA.", "NTA. You told it like it is. I can't believe your mom thinks you should turn your back on her grandchildren when their father is acting like a baby trying to avoid paying for their upkeep. That's some crazy thinking right there.", "NTA.  You called it correctly.\n\nI also hate to say it but if your brother is in his 50's that puts your mother in her 70's.  She won't be around to enable him forever, and it's not going to look good with employers if he's in his 60's looking for a job after not having one for a decade or more.", "NTA. Let Steve be Mom's project and let mom be Steve's project.", "Literally not giving money that could go to his kids .", "I see where your brother gets it. With all that support for bad actions something tells me your brother has always been a piece of work...", "NTA. Just want to say your are awesome for stepping up for those kids and their mom. It was super nice of you to bring the cake too. You are modeling being a decent human for your kids. Keep it up."]}
