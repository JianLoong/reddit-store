The problem is I (17m) made a joke that turned out horrible. Me and my Dad have always been close we would go fishing, fix cars, and he would teach me general life skills and I've always been grateful for that and what really made us get along was our very similar sense of humor. When my Dad had his surgery we both made our fair amount of jokes about him passing and life insurance. I know that sounds terrible but it's just how we are and we were both just trying to stay positive. So about four months after his surgery we had some family over just my two sisters little brother and my dads wife.About an hour into the night he made a joke about me not getting his life insurance yet to which I responded \"Its a shame ill have to try harder next time\" at that we both laughed for a minute and then continued the conversation as normal. well two days later My dad had a brain aneurism and he didn't survive. he died pretty quickly I know this because I was the one who had to kick down the door and find him. It's a horrible feeling and I can't get it out of my head . my family hasn't said any thing directly but they don't look at me anymore. none of them even look me in the eye. I don't know what to do we were just joking and now he's gone and my family can't look at me I'm not sure if I'm a terrible person but it feels like it please tell me if I'm a  awful person.

That humor was something you shared. Never forget your dad laughed too, remember how he laughed keep that in your mind. He loved your humor and loved all of what you and he shared.\n\nI lost my mother very recently, I understand the flood of various emotions churning inside. Therapy is always suggested to the point of sounding cliche but it IS the best medicine at these times.\n\nNTA, it's not possible.", ">he died pretty quickly I know this because I was the one who had to kick down the door and find him. It's a horrible feeling and I can't get it out of my head \n\nOh Jesus. Oh sweetheart. You have nothing to feel guilty about. Your dad knew you adored him. Your shared sense of humor was just one way of bonding. Don\u2019t forget that he joked back in kind. He knew you weren\u2019t serious.   \n\n\nYou\u2019ve all been traumatized by the loss. It does not speak well of the adults in your life that they are behaving this way, but grief does strange things to people.   \n\n\nI am so sorry that you lost your beloved dad. I wish he was still here with you. If you ever want to talk message me. I am no stranger to loss and grief. There are people who care about you. Even strangers on this thread.   \n\n\nI wish you peace and healing during this difficult time \n\nNTA", "You are NTA and have no reason to feel guilty.\n\nNo matter the outcome, this was a joke you and your dad shared and was likely a way to help keep his fear at bay.\n\nYou did nothing wrong and helped to bring laughter to his life in his last days.", "Nta at all. Your dad laughed because in the context it was fine. Absolutely no one would ever think you had been serious. Please let this misplaced guilt go. This circumstance isn\u2019t your fault and you have no control over the events. I\u2019m am sure your dad loved you beyond measure and knew you felt, and still feel, the same. Your whole family is reeling right now, all you can do is be gracious and understand if someone lashes out, it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about them. You can\u2019t feel worse than you already do because your dad is gone. I\u2019m so very sorry for your loss.", "My family always makes \u201cdark\u201d jokes. When my mom broke her neck and was in rehab we told her we were going to put her in the wheelchair and roll her down the giant hill next to the rehab (and into the pond). She laughed her ass off. The guy visiting his wife in the next bed was so horrified.", "NTA if my dad lived near me when he was dying we probably would have made similar jokes. And he was actively dying of liver failure. In fact I\u2019m sure he did joke around in the hospital with his friends and brother. Be glad you gave him humor and a laugh in his last days!! And idk your families beliefs or anything but just in case it needs to be said. You. Did. Not. Curse. Your. Dad.", "Man....my sincerest condolences for you. You had absolutely no clue your father was going to pass so quickly. Everyone deals with lose in their own ways. Some just cry about it and feel sad, others use dark humor to get by. Your father and you used dark humor to get over the hard times. He probably wanted your memories of him to be smiling and laughing, not filled with sorrow. Your family will take his lose as they will. Don't be worried about them. In time they will heal. Remember you had a loving father who loved spending time with his son. Some people just don't have that.", "NTA- first, I am so sorry for your loss. That must have been horrible and traumatic. You are not a terrible person. \n\nHumor is super common reaction to stress.  My child had a near death experience this year in a way that is ridiculous.  And there are times that I talk about it. Flippantly.  I actually looked online to read of what happened to us happened to somebody else, one other family.\n\nAnd I was talking to a friend about it, and I said I had to joke about it because it was literally my nightmare. Trust I do not want my child to die and I know you did not want your father to die. \n\nYour mind does it to protect you.  Because the mind can only take so much without letting it out.\n\nI want you to look into therapy and maybe specifically survivor's guilt.  It's a super strong thing.  You're a good person, father knows that you loved him very much.", "NTA \n\nAw babe I don\u2019t think your family is mad or anything! It was a joke and your dad made it too. It didn\u2019t make anything happen or affect the outcome in any way. Your dad loved you and you helped bring some levity to his final hours. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA - that was a joke you and your dad shared. *Shared*. Everyone (including yourself) is grieving right now, so emotions are going to be running both high and weird. \n\nIt\u2019s normal to feel some guilt, as long as you come to understand in time that you don\u2019t need to feel guilty because you did nothing wrong. \n\nCarry on making jokes like that when you feel up to it. It\u2019s a part of your dad that you can carry with you for the rest of your life. Also, humour is a useful and healthy coping mechanism", "Of course you are NTA!! \n\nPlease know that, from someone who is old enough to be your mum, from the bottom of my heart. I absolutely, 100% promise you that you are not an AH,  and you did nothing wrong at all. On the contrary, you made your dad laugh and smile during his recovery. You were his joy! He must have loved you so much and felt so close with you, to joke with you like that. My dad had a heart attack pretty young, and he liked (and still likes) to joke about it too. Jokes are how we get through hard times sometimes.\n\nOh honey, I'm so sorry that you even feel like you need to ask this. My heart is breaking for you. You are so young, and your dad clearly loved you so much. I don't think your family blames you for anything, I think they are just lost in their own grief . . .and your brain is telling you that they are blaming you and your joke because you are hurting so much and trying to make sense of something unbelievably painful. But if none of them have said anything to you, probably they don't even remember the joke. They're just horribly sad, and stuck in their own heads right now, not angry at you.\n\nSending you much love and a million hugs. Be kind to yourself. You were a wonderful son who gave your dad joy and laughter at the end of his life. That's something to be proud of.", "Not even remotely close to an A.  This from a dad of a 17 year old son who can tell you first hand just how much your father cherished your relationship. NTA whatsoever young man - rest easy.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t do something wrong here. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. And that the timing of it makes it hard on all of you. But everyone\u2019s likely overwhelmed with grief and still processing what\u2019s happened. \n\nPlease don\u2019t blame yourself or bottle this up. Maybe sharing how much it bothers you would help them know what to make if it. If they do  for some reason blame you, they\u2019re not doing so rationally.", "Nta", "NTA, this was the sort of banter between you and your dad.  I get it.  Just because the two of you joked about it does not mean in any way shape or form that you wished for this or caused it.  Sometimes things just happen and this was one of those situations.  Please don't blame yourself.", "NTA - Humor helps in dark times. It's called dark humor. You didn't think he'd actually pass away. I send my sincerest condolences.", "NTA.  Your Dad made the joke  because he wanted you to laugh.  He wanted you to find some bright moments in a dark time.  Yeah the timing is terrible, but neither of you knew what was coming in the future.  Don't worry about them, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nYour dad obviously loved you kiddo, and shared a special bond with you that maybe the rest of the family didn\u2019t understand but they never were going to\n\nThat was your special relationship with him and no one else\u2019s\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your dad, bud\n\nI love you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s a horrible thing, but my dad and I have always been close, just like you and your dad, and we cope with jokes. I tell him I\u2019m gonna attach his medical marijuana to a little RC car and run it into the desert so I won\u2019t have to pay his medical bills.

Now that his treatment has stopped working and he only has a few months left, *he* jokes about all the fun we\u2019ll have with his life insurance money.  \n\nSome people don\u2019t like dark humour, but for many others, it\u2019s a valid and *healthy* coping mechanism.", "NTA. The most important thing is that you and your Dad loved each other. You made him laugh at a tense time. No one could have caused or predicted what happened. Nothing you said or did hurt your Dad, instead you made him happy. Do not feel guilty or think your siblings blame you. They knew the way you and your Dad joked. They are grieving the same as you.\n\nMy neighbour had an inoperable brain tumour and knew he was terminal. He planned his own funeral and the after gathering. When you walked into the gathering hall, the song playing was Queen's \"another one bites the dust\". He wanted people to laugh and be happy. \n\nMany big hugs to you.

You never know when or how it's gonna happen. It seems like the joke was a SHARED joke between you that your father started up- you have nothing to feel bad about. If anything, it shows how dearly he loved you, that he felt so comfortable joking about a serious thing like that. Just take it day by day, everyone is grieving, but I promise no one is blaming this on you. You're gonna be okay, and when you're ready for it, therapy helps a lot. Take care dude, and my deepest condolences.", "As hard as it is to accept, their opinions don\u2019t matter. Your dads thought are the only ones that are important. When my dad died, I didn\u2019t know a lot of people at his service so I didn\u2019t share my emotions freely. Instead made a smartass joke about my dads ideas on timing.

Maybe they feel guilty that you went through that on your own and they don\u2019t know what to say?", "NTA. It's really special that you and your dad had the same sense of humor. Those jokes probably helped him get through some really shitty times.", "NTA\n\nMy dad and I had a dark sense of humor. The day he died we were joking about him having too much chest hair for the heart monitors to pick anything up (I had driven him to the ER because of the chest pains he was having). Then he started seizing and I had to scream for the nurse. I watched as they tried to shock his heart into beating again before being dragged out of the room.\n\nHe died that day. I was 16. Alone. My mom was still a 45 minute drive away and my older brother an hour. I sat with my dads dead body waiting for my family to come so they could say goodbye.\n\nNone of that was your fault. It will feel like it is. I sometimes still catch myself thinking that if only I had taken him to the hospital sooner. If only we hadn\u2019t wasted time joking about the heart monitors falling off and just got a nurse to help. If only I had done *something* different, then my dad would be alive.\n\nBut I didn\u2019t. There\u2019s nothing I could have done then and there definitely isn\u2019t anything I can do now.\n\nFind your support system. If not in your family then your friends. Hell even the internet strangers here have shown they are willing to listen. It will take time. It\u2019s been five years for me and like I said I still have those moments of doubt, but it will get easier, as long as you\u2019re willing to try.\n\nI knew that my dad wouldn\u2019t want me to be miserable forever because of his death and I\u2019m sure your dad felt the same. I\u2019m not religious but I do believe in an afterlife, and I think my dad is there laughing about the irony of his last joke. He\u2019s probably proud of the fact his last words was a cheesy line. I can\u2019t speak for your dad but he sounds a lot like mine, so I\u2019d think he\u2019d feel the same way.", "Oh, honey. I\u2019m so sorry. You are not an awful person. No one thinks you are an awful person. They probably don\u2019t even remember that joke.  My family also enjoys dark humor. It\u2019s a healthy coping mechanism. Sometimes it\u2019s even hilarious. Please give yourself time to grieve. It sounds like you had a wonderful dad and that he loved you very much.\n\nIf you think some counseling might help, get some counseling. It helped me when my dad died when I was young.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo much NTA", "I am in 100% agreement with you here. This is worded perfectly. OP has nothing to feel guilty about and is NTA."]}
