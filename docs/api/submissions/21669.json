Your dad laughed because in the context it was fine. Absolutely no one would ever think you had been serious. Please let this misplaced guilt go. This circumstance isn\u2019t your fault and you have no control over the events. I\u2019m am sure your dad loved you beyond measure and knew you felt, and still feel, the same. Your whole family is reeling right now, all you can do is be gracious and understand if someone lashes out, it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about them.

You had absolutely no clue your father was going to pass so quickly. Everyone deals with lose in their own ways. Some just cry about it and feel sad, others use dark humor to get by. Your father and you used dark humor to get over the hard times. He probably wanted your memories of him to be smiling and laughing, not filled with sorrow.

I actually looked online to read of what happened to us happened to somebody else, one other family.\n\nAnd I was talking to a friend about it, and I said I had to joke about it because it was literally my nightmare.

He must have loved you so much and felt so close with you, to joke with you like that. My dad had a heart attack pretty young, and he liked (and still likes) to joke about it too. Jokes are how we get through hard times sometimes.\n\nOh honey, I'm so sorry that you even feel like you need to ask this. My heart is breaking for you. You are so young, and your dad clearly loved you so much. I don't think your family blames you for anything, I think they are just lost in their own grief . . .and your brain is telling you that they are blaming you and your joke because you are hurting so much and trying to make sense of something unbelievably painful. But if none of them have said anything to you, probably they don't even remember the joke. They're just horribly sad, and stuck in their own heads right now, not angry at you.\n\nSending you much love and a million hugs. Be kind to yourself.

The day he died we were joking about him having too much chest hair for the heart monitors to pick anything up (I had driven him to the ER because of the chest pains he was having). Then he started seizing and I had to scream for the nurse. I watched as they tried to shock his heart into beating again before being dragged out of the room.\n\nHe died that day. I was 16. Alone.

You're way too young for this :( I'm 44 and just lost my mom 2 weeks ago after we lost my dad 7 years earlier. None of them managed to turn 70.\n\nWell, my mom was a nurse and I think that's where I got my sick sense of humour from. When my dad was admittet to a new ICU where they didn't know my mom, some of the nurses kept a pretty close eye to us the first few days because our sense of humour was apparently a red flag. It didn't take them very long to realize that we loved that man dearly and did whatever we needed to stay afloat for those weeks to be there for him.\n\nOne of the jokes was fighting over who got to tell him that he was now a non-smoker. Another comment was when they had to remove his beard because of bedsores that we'd love to see him with a Lemmy moustache. \n\nYour dad was scared shitless too and humour is often a coping mechanism. It doesn't look good seen from the outside but a lot of us know what the world is really like and that we need to cope however way we can because the alternative is collapsing. Your dad got as much out of those jokes as you did and if he was here, he'd hug you and tell you that.\n\nYour dad didn't die alone, he had his beloved son with him and THAT's what you should be focusing on.

We even agreed I pick his more recent furniture because I\u2019ll be the one getting it. Some are mortified but that\u2019s how we cope. My dad often made jokes with his late wife before she passed. All that matters is the other party was not offended", "NTA - as someone who blamed themselves for their father's death \\[for similar reasons\\] for a long time, i can tell you very honestly it is not your fault.  please seek help to deal with this as finding a loved one dead is never easy. \\[ . .i can also relate to that but, not the point.\\] i promise you are NTA. I hope you can find some peace and know it's not your fault nor are you an awful person.", "NTA. You and your dad were making those jokes together. There was no ill intent behind it. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "NTA your dad loved to joke and you just got along with him ... I don't believe he could be more happy, it was something between you and him, this is the reason why your family can't understand ...", "NTA. Your dad obviously felt comforted during his illness by joking with you, IMO you showed him respect by continuing the light-hearted banter.", "Oh man, I'm so sorry for your loss. My immediate family is like this too with the dark humour (my mum regularly jokes that she's still worth more alive than dead, so don't murder her for her life insurance yet) so I get it. \n\nYou're NTA and you're not an awful person. Your dad participated in the jokes, so it's not like you were joking and he hated it (that *would* make you an asshole). Virtual hugs.", "NTA - My wife was terminally ill and we made awful jokes. The humor helped us release the obvious ever present tension of our situation. We had to be careful though, because those outside of our relationship could find it shocking and disturbing. The fact that you and your father could joke with each other speaks volumes about the closeness of your bond, and it indicates that you both felt safe enough with one another to express yourselves in that way. Clearly, you miss him terribly.  I am so sorry for your loss! Cherish the love he had for you.", "[removed]", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s normal to feel some guilt, as long as you come to understand in time that you", "This would be me.... Forgetting that not everyone in earshot shares the same sense of humour..", "Just remember that every time you dream of him , that\u2019s him coming back to visit you.", "Wow. I'm so sorry for your loss. NAH here but it I had to pick id say your family are assholes for making you feel terrible even though he's your dad too. Again, I don't think they're actually assholes bc grief is sometimes irrational and maybe that's just how they're handling it. Try not to take it personally and hopefully when they process things a bit more they'll start treating you normally again. It sucks though that you're having to put up with this while also mourning your dad, but idk what advice to give you. Sending you strength though", "NTA - don\u2019t blame yourself. You also couldn\u2019t have controlled this at all, this isn\u2019t your fault \n\nSorry for your loss, you\u2019re certainly not an awful person", "I am sorry for your loss. That\u2019s horrible to lose a parent so suddenly. \n\nNot everyone appreciates jokes about death or dying, but your dad did, so you and him laughing about it was okay. It\u2019s just a shitty coincidence that he passed soon after. You didn\u2019t make it happen.", "Lost my mom to a brain aneurysm, too.  I'm so, so sorry for your loss.\n\nEverything is raw right now.  I don't think anyone in your family truly faults you (and if they do, they're being very unkind).  Try to be kind to yourself here.  NTA, of course.\n\nI'd like to share something with you that a friend told me when I lost my mom.  We were very, very close, but we'd recently started arguing because of the guy I was seeing (turns out she was right about him), and when she passed so suddenly and unexpectedly, I lamented to my friend that so many of our final conversations were tense, if not outright arguments.\n\n*\"It's a drop in the ocean compared to a lifetime,\"* he reassured me.\n\nThis joke you made, which there was nothing wrong with in the first place, is a drop in the ocean of your relationship with your father, all the years and conversations and love.\n\nI wish you peace as you navigate your grief.", "NTA!! \n\nYoung man, I (53F) am so sorry for your loss. That's absolutely brutal especially after he survived the scariness of bypass surgery.  You are not an A for sharing the jokes with him. \n\nYou need to find someone safe to talk to. Some ideas: a coach. Teacher. Guidance counselor. A pastor, priest, or Rabbi if you are a person of faith. Possibly a family friend. A therapist. Right now, family is too close to the situation to be able to process things with you in an objective manner.\n\nLosing a parent, although an expected life event, is almost always too soon. I just lost my Daddy the month before my birthday. You are at an age where you're starting to transition into independence and adulthood and sometimes parent- child relationships can get a little hairy. He clearly loved, are you, him. Cherish that as you grieve. Hugs to you.", "OP, I am sorry for your loss. I can\u2019t imagine how awful it must have been to be the one to find him. You and your dad shared humor that may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but that\u2019s for you guys to share and cherish.  Your family is grieving and everyone grieves differently. OP, NTA, again I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA \n\nmy dad went to the ER for a headache that wouldn\u2019t go away. He made jokes the whole time. He told the doctor he needed a perception for a guillotine. \n\nHe was fine in the end.\n\n\nYou and your dad used humor as a coping mechanism. If you were both making life insurance jokes I don\u2019t see the problem.\n\nYou didn\u2019t cause his brain aneurysm. You didn\u2019t kill him. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that.", "NTA - you both laughed, part of humor is the joy of shared laughter. He passed unexpectedly and grief is a strange beast; you did nothing wrong and your family is reeling just as you are. When i was grieving a serious loss, I felt like I lost myself as well and couldn't be myself around others. You may be focusing on their interactions with you, but it's also possible they aren't making eye contact with each other or acting like themselves with others. Best of luck with your healing process, I'm so sorry for your loss. You did nothing wrong in making a joke with your father, making him laugh and bringing him joy. It's unfortunate that life played out as it did, but you did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nDark humor isn\u2019t for everyone, but it was for your dad. The only thing here is the timing of that humor. You couldn\u2019t have known what was going to happen the next day, or even 3 days after that interaction. \n\nTry a reflect on the interactions with your family. Grief does weird things sometimes. You might be putting more guilt on yourself to see how they interact with you vs. each other. It\u2019ll be ok, but everyone is grieving. \n\nDon\u2019t think too hard on it and just know that as long as your dad was ok with those jokes, then that\u2019s all that matters.", "Oh sweetheart you are nta at all. He made the joke too, he knew it wasn\u2019t serious, it\u2019s not your fault that the other family members don\u2019t have the same humour as you did with your Dad.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss and for how you\u2019re feeling now.", "If you find yourself continuing to feel badly about this or feel any other kind of guilt, I hope you'll seriously consider the therapy suggested above. I didn't do that and I struggled with unnecessary negative emotions about it for decades. Wouldn't want to see you go through the same. It's clear that you both were on the same page. You have no reason to feel bad or second guess yourself. I'm so sorry that you lost your dad, and so early.", "One of the jokes was fighting over who got to tell him that he was now a non-smoker.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Gallows humor", "Bot \\^\\^\n\n[Original](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u3l19/aita_for_joking_about_my_dads_death/jr5iyd1/)", "Bot \\^\\^\n\n[Original](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u3l19/aita_for_joking_about_my_dads_death/jr6ovb9/)", "Bot \\^\\^\n\n[Original](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u3l19/aita_for_joking_about_my_dads_death/jr6cit6/)", "Bot \\^\\^\n\n[Original](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u3l19/aita_for_joking_about_my_dads_death/jr6g54b/)", "Bot \\^\\^\n\n[Original](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u3l19/aita_for_joking_about_my_dads_death/jr6cit6/)", "Bot \\^\\^\n\n[Original](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u3l19/aita_for_joking_about_my_dads_death/jr5q6ab/)"]}
