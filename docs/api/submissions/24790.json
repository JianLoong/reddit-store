I understand the question was sudden but you\u2019re an adult and could\u2019ve listened to their thoughts about it and then talked to your fianc\u00e9 who should then relaying and communicate it to mom. \n\nI don\u2019t think the screaming was appropriate but I\u2019d be so angry if my ex told my kids it\u2019s fine to call someone else Daddy regardless of if they\u2019re remarried or not. I agree with Mom ultimately despite the distasteful delivery and probably would of had a similar initial reaction.", "NTA. It's understandable that their mom would be wounded to hear her kids calling someone else 'mom', but the kids are *so* young, if you're marrying their dad they should be able to look to you as a mother figure. At the end of the day, the adults' feelings in this situation come second to the kids' secure attachment.", "Why couldn\u2019t you have come up with a special name like Mom in another language or Ma Ami or something like that? A lot of kids do that for Grandparents   Problem solved", "ESH \n\nThe mom was way out of line to blow up on you like that.\n\nBut do not allow those kids to call you mom. That hurts so bad which is why she is lashing out.", "NTA.  But I have a concern about all of this. You are still in the honeymoon of your relationship with their dad.  Time will tell if an 8 month living together will last. Creating this bond must consider the lasting nature of your relationship with their father. I would soft pedal this until the marriage takes place.", "NTA - She's being possessive over her kids, which is understandable, but she's going about this the wrong way. The kids have so much love in their life they want to call you mother as well as their own mother. She has no actual reason to be threatened. The kids brought this up themselves, and as long as you aren't putting little birdies in their ears about this and coaxing them to call you mom (which would be messed up imo), I think you're in the clear here. The kids can call you what they want to!", "NTA for allowing it, but this was a big mistake for a healthy coparenting relationship. It would have been way better to include their mom in this decision. When they began to call you mom they were 2 and 3 years old. Typically children at that age call people mom, because they do the things a mother would do like make them food, give them a bath or tuck them in at night. The whole stepparent thing is really hard to understand for kids at that age. \n\nUnfortunately now there are a lot of hurt feelings involved, because their mom was ambushed with your decision. She clearly was very wrong for her way to handle the situation. But to stop further escalations you need to meet without the kids and have an honest talk about it. Coparenting is no joke and whenever there are hurt feelings involved the kids are always the ones that have to suffer the most.", "YTA. Especially for referring to their mother as their \u201cbio mom\u201d; a term reserved for markedly different relationships. You\u2019re talking about a woman who has joint custody of her children; not one, who, for example, might receive an annual letter from her offspring\u2019s adoptive parents\u2019 about their progress. Not that those women wouldn\u2019t deserve more consideration than you\u2019ve managed to show here.\n\nDo you genuinely have no concept of \u201cmom\u201d (& associated terms) being a precious designation? Absolutely zero understanding of the level of pain you have caused? It\u2019s perfectly true some children will call a woman other than the one who birthed them \u201cmummy\u201d; but vanishingly rare for that to happen if they retain a relationship with - & here I am using the term correctly - their biological mother.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said \u201cyes\u201d, you should have asked \u201cwhy?\u201d; & informed the children\u2019s mother. \n\n(I\u2019d not be too overwhelmed with emotion about them calling you mommy at bedtime etc btw: even older children quite routinely call anyone female in a vaguely caring role \u201cmummy\u201d: did you never hear a teacher call a classmate mummy?)\n\nTopping it all off by deciding to tell the children to ignore what their mother had said? How can you possibly think that will end well?\n\nNo, she shouldn\u2019t have used profanities in front of the children, but she\u2019s still not T A. That crown is yours, but your fianc\u00e9 holds the sceptre, given he so willingly facilitated this.", "ESH....the adults should have talked about this together before telling the kids. Mom is Mom, maybe OP is Momma, or Momma \"name\".\n\nAlso, OP referring ro Mom as \"bio mom\" raises some flags. She's Mom, not bio Mom. Or else you should refer to Dad as bio Dad.", "NTA, mom\u2019s ego is bruised and that may be why she lashed out on you. It\u2019s probably very tough to hear her kids calling another person mom. Hopefully y\u2019all can revisit the convo when she calms a bit", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have made the decision of letting the kids call you mom without talking to their actual mother.

I couldn\u2019t fit it all in the post but I do remember her bringing up how miserable I\u2019m going to be with my fianc\u00e9, even though he\u2019s the guy from my dreams. Hoping time will either heal this or allow the kids to figure out who they want in their life. I can\u2019t force them to love me, but I can love them naturally.", "Apparently it is from what I\u2019ve heard from my SO and bio moms parents. She has a mental health history I won\u2019t divulge to the internet but she acts like a 14 y/o who had her phone taken away. She\u2019s always decent around me but I have heard stories from anyone who knows her and after that phone convo we all had, it showed me she isn\u2019t going to listen to anything I say so I\u2019m saving my energy", "No she is not. She is becoming their fathers wife, not their mother.", "I unfortunately had an abusive step mom & dad growing up, and I never want to make the kids feel the way I did around my step parents..", "We\u2019ve known each other for 3 years and I met his kids maybe a year after that? I knew about them and had seen pictures but we weren\u2019t dating at the time I met the kids and I was just a friend to daddy. And believe me, even still when they call me mom it\u2019s weird for me, but it shows me I\u2019m doing the right things for when his and I\u2019s kid comes into the world.", "No one is asking you to be afraid in your relationship with your boyfriend.  I was suggesting that you are acting like their mother.  Why isn't he tucking them into bed and reading them stories.", "could you guys come up with another name for mom for them to call you? That was the ex can be mom and you could be ma, momma, mumsy, etc.\n\ni googled and this fun list came up. There are some silly ones! https://www.lovetoknow.com/life/relationships/120-clever-names-mom-mother", "As a child whose parents are not together anymore, one thing I know for certain is that parents sometimes let their egos get in the way, but eventually they can come around, I hope that\u2019ll be the case. Y\u2019all have the same goal in your heart which is to be the best parents to those little ones", "Actually coparenting must be based on mutual respect and communication. My parents were divorced. My mother had full custody and we spent every other weekend with my father. My mother talked to my father about all decisions concerning my and my sister. She didn't legally have to. But she did. Because that was what was best for us.", "No it's not up to the kids. It's up to the adults to set boundaries, which you are not doing.", "You should have talked to their mother first. And then, depending on the result of the conversation, you could go back to the kids and 1) do what you did if the mother was ok with that or, 2) explain to them that even though you love them very very much and they can always count on you, their mother is their mother and that out of respect for her, they shouldn't call you that.\n\nI'm not saying you should forbid them, but if the mother doesn't like it you should explain to them why they shouldn't.", "No it\u2019s not up to the kids. You\u2019re the adult and set the boundaries", "You\u2019re the girlfriend. Not a mom to them. Just because you\u2019re a shack up honey doesn\u2019t make you a mom", "You can pretend all you want, you are the stepmother, not their mom.\n\nIn my line of work I see the damage a new woman coming into a relationship thinking they are better than the other parent can do.  The Dad is not innocent here either.  He\u2019s playing you so hard and your desperation to be \u2018the best\u2019 is telling.  \n\nReality is, he picked you so he has a built-in babysitter,  so doesn\u2019t have to take care of the kids, you do it for him.  \n\nNo one should interfere with the parent/child relationship, and if you are going to be one of those people that do, don\u2019t be so proud of yourself on the internet for all to see.", "Please get counselling soon. Speaking this way is going to hurt these kids. Try to be empathetic and not sound so judgmental.", "Because an actual mom knows that adults do what\u2019s best for children which is setting boundaries and not creating extra trouble when co parenting. And calling her a term for moms that give up their children is extra dramatic!", "Life isn\u2019t always a perfectly planned timeline. Sometimes the situation arises where you have to have the conversation with the kid first because they brought it up, and it gets back to the mom before you can figure out how to bring it up properly. Life is messy.", "I agree. There could have been a discussion with the mom about what the kids said and what names the mom would be comfortable with them calling OP. I understand it was a situation that came out of nowhere for OP, but to go from being a \"special friend\" to \"mom\" is a big leap. Mom should have been made aware of this change in situation by OP's fianc\u00e9.", "Clearly there was a lack of proactive, adult communication going both ways here.", "Except you should have spoken to her first. It\u2019s possible that her reaction is not coming from a place of ego but of protection of her very young children. Yes she reacted badly. You are an adult though, you can see that if your relationship with this man doesn\u2019t work out it\u2019s going to be mom that has to help these children through the difficult times. You\u2019re setting it up not respecting her or her children by not creating a safe place for these kids by setting boundaries! In the moment you should have put your own ego aside and said to these children \u201cyou have a momma, how about the grown ups talk this over and we\u2019ll let you know what the best thing to call me is.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just that simple. Be the adult. You owe her an apology big time!", "Yup! You\u2019re doing what you can. It might be worth asking your SO if he thinks you should stop them from calling you mom, only because he\u2019ll understand the dynamic better than anyone. \n\nNot an easy situation, but you have your head on straight. Best of luck!", "But you have upset her. Sooo badly. The question is whether you\u2019re prepared to rectify it?", "Yeahhhh she needs to move on to a less bitter place and be happy her kids don\u2019t have to experience an \u201cevil step mom\u201d situation cause it could be worse.", "If she has a mental health history, it'll be harder to talk to her, no wonder why she isn't going to listen to anything you say. Yeah, better to save your energy, it'll be pretty much impossible to talk to her if she won't listen to anything you say.", "She is going to do everything their bio mom does for them and will be a maternal figure, that\u2019s a mother", "He does, they always want a hug, kiss, and \u201cpows\u201d (little fist bumps) as they call it from \u201cmom\u201d (me) & dad. Him and I co parent them as if they were our own, so when his and I\u2019s little one(s) arrive no kid will feel the wrath of favoritism.", "Mutual respect and communication doesn\u2019t mean that decisions involving things going on in your household need to be run by the other parent who has nothing to do with what goes on in your household. The kids CHOOSING to call stepmom \u201cmom\u201d in their household with stepmom and bio dad literally does not affect biomom except to hurt her ego and feelings. You have your experience with your situation but that doesn\u2019t mean your experience applies to other situations across the board.", "In this situation, it should be up to them. As long as they aren\u2019t calling either of us bad names, it honestly shouldn\u2019t matter. They do still refer to me by my legal name, but only if I don\u2019t respond right away to \u201cmom\u201d", "Sounds like projection but I hope if it is you heal from it and take care of your kids/ step kids like they\u2019re your own too", "she not even the step mom yet.", "You sound like you\u2019re going through her emotions. I\u2019m sorry, I hope you heal and feel better", "Oh, that I agree with but why wouldn\u2019t they call mom right after the conversation to let her know. It\u2019s a big deal.", "Calling a step parent by their first name has no bearing on the type of relationship they will have.  You can have a loving and healthy relationship with step kids and still be respectful to their bio parent", "I know it will. There\u2019s obviously so much more than what I was allowed to type. But at the end of the day, if I\u2019m doing a better job naturally being their mom and they like me more, that\u2019s on her. She can\u2019t punish them 24/7 then wonder why they resent her", "She will be a parental figure, not their mother.", "Ah. Now the truth comes out.  He got you pregnant without marrying you. You take care of his kids like a mother and soon you will be completely trapped. Remember he dumped his first woman with two kids to care for and he is only 28.", "No it absolutely shouldn't, you over stepped.", "This is not your call to make. You are not their mother.", "Is it a hill worth dying on? Your relationship with their mum has been good up until now. For a peaceful family life the aim should be to maintain that. Yet you are continuing to hurt her when you know how upset she is by this?", "Info - How old are you?", "I agree with that. There\u2019s definitely a lack of proactive, adult communication on both sides here."]}
