She still did not like that, and went on about how it hurts her feelings that the kids are saying she isn\u2019t their mom anymore and all this nonsense. I got firm quickly and explained that I understand why it would hurt her feelings, but I don\u2019t believe what she\u2019s saying because of what I have heard the kids themselves say.

I understand the question was sudden but you\u2019re an adult and could\u2019ve listened to their thoughts about it and then talked to your fianc\u00e9 who should then relaying and communicate it to mom. \n\nI don\u2019t think the screaming was appropriate but I\u2019d be so angry if my ex told my kids it\u2019s fine to call someone else Daddy without even talking to me regardless of if they\u2019re remarried or not. I agree with Mom ultimately despite the distasteful delivery and probably would of had a similar initial reaction.", "NTA. It's understandable that their mom would be wounded to hear her kids calling someone else 'mom', but the kids are *so* young, if you're marrying their dad they should be able to look to you as a mother figure. At the end of the day, the adults' feelings in this situation come second to the kids' secure attachment.", "Why couldn\u2019t you have come up with a special name like Mom in another language or Ma Ami or something like that? A lot of kids do that for Grandparents   Problem solved", "ESH \n\nThe mom was way out of line to blow up on you like that.\n\nBut do not allow those kids to call you mom. That hurts so bad which is why she is lashing out.", "NTA.  But I have a concern about all of this. You are still in the honeymoon of your relationship with their dad.  Time will tell if an 8 month living together will last. Creating this bond must consider the lasting nature of your relationship with their father. I would soft pedal this until the marriage takes place.", "NTA - She's being possessive over her kids, which is understandable, but she's going about this the wrong way. The kids have so much love in their life they want to call you mother as well as their own mother. She has no actual reason to be threatened. The kids brought this up themselves, and as long as you aren't putting little birdies in their ears about this and coaxing them to call you mom (which would be messed up imo), I think you're in the clear here. The kids can call you what they want to!", "NTA for allowing it, but this was a big mistake for a healthy coparenting relationship. It would have been way better to include their mom in this decision. When they began to call you mom they were 2 and 3 years old. Typically children at that age call people mom, because they do the things a mother would do like make them food, give them a bath or tuck them in at night. The whole stepparent thing is really hard to understand for kids at that age. \n\nUnfortunately now there are a lot of hurt feelings involved, because their mom was ambushed with your decision. She clearly was very wrong for her way to handle the situation. But to stop further escalations you need to meet without the kids and have an honest talk about it. Coparenting is no joke and whenever there are hurt feelings involved the kids are always the ones that have to suffer the most.", "YTA. Especially for referring to their mother as their \u201cbio mom\u201d; a term reserved for markedly different relationships. You\u2019re talking about a woman who has joint custody of her children; not one, who, for example, might receive an annual letter from her offspring\u2019s adoptive parents\u2019 about their progress. Not that those women wouldn\u2019t deserve more consideration than you\u2019ve managed to show here.\n\nDo you genuinely have no concept of \u201cmom\u201d (& associated terms) being a precious designation? Absolutely zero understanding of the level of pain you have caused? It\u2019s perfectly true some children will call a woman other than the one who birthed them \u201cmummy\u201d; but vanishingly rare for that to happen if they retain a relationship with - & here I am using the term correctly - their biological mother.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said \u201cyes\u201d, you should have asked \u201cwhy?\u201d; & informed the children\u2019s mother. \n\n(I\u2019d not be too overwhelmed with emotion about them calling you mommy at bedtime etc btw: even older children quite routinely call anyone female in a vaguely caring role \u201cmummy\u201d: did you never hear a teacher call a classmate mummy?)\n\nTopping it all off by deciding to tell the children to ignore what their mother had said? How can you possibly think that will end well?\n\nNo, she shouldn\u2019t have used profanities in front of the children, but she\u2019s still not T A. That crown is yours, but your fianc\u00e9 holds the sceptre, given he so willingly facilitated this.", "ESH....the adults should have talked about this together before telling the kids.

Or else you should refer to Dad as bio Dad.", "NTA, mom\u2019s ego is bruised and that may be why she lashed out on you. It\u2019s probably very tough to hear her kids calling another person mom. Hopefully y\u2019all can revisit the convo when she calms a bit", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have made the decision of letting the kids call you mom without talking to their actual mother.

Both my husband and I made it clear that I was not his mom and he can\u2019t call me mom because it would hurt his actual Mom\u2019s feelings. Telling him no made him cry, and it sucked for a few weeks because he kept on trying to call me mommy. If the mom is in the kids life, the concept of \u201canother mom\u201d can be confusing to kids as young as 3. I think neither you or your bf considered that when you gave the kids the go ahead to call you that. Just because they say they understand doesn\u2019t actually mean they grasp the concept. My step son could not pronounce my name when he started talking and he heard his dad call me babe all his life, so he calls me babe too. He\u2019s almost 7 now, and understands exactly who I am to him and his dad. You can always get the kids to call you another name that allows them to express affection for you, but it definitely doesn\u2019t have to be mom.

Just because they said one thing to you, does not mean they said the exact same thing to their mom. Extremely inflammatory to basically call her a liar when she calls expressing genuine concern about their dads gf being their \u201cnew mom\u201d. You were looking for a fight here, and you got one. \nYou were \u201cfirm\u201d with their mother about their right to also call you mom, but it simply isn\u2019t your place to get \u201cfirm\u201d with a mother about what SHE is comfortable with her children doing. The bottom line is they are her children, and encouraging them to call you mom as young as 3 and 4 is extremely confusing for them, whether they initiated it or not. They can call you another affectionate name that isn\u2019t mom and it will not have any detrimental effect on your relationship with them since they clearly do view you in a maternal role. And calling her their \u201cbirth giver\u201d? Are you for real? She\u2019s their mother. As a stepmom of over 5 years, I literally cannot imagine ever referring to my stepsons mother like this, even though we\u2019ve definitely had our issues and my husband and I have had our disagreements with her and she hasn\u2019t always been the most attentive parent. It\u2019s not a competition between you and their mother, and you don\u2019t need to constantly compare the way you take care of her kids with the way she takes care of her kids. I think all adults in this situation could have handled this better.

The same can be said of people not blood related, who we call brother or sister.\n\nThe biological mother will always be that and no twist of fate will change that. However to be called mom (in this case) is a treasured title that is imparted, most likely because these kids feel safe and loved despite the OP and her marital status.

Skids were young when they came to live with DH and I.  The oldest started poking around saying that BM was totally okay if they wanted to call me mom since they lived with me 24/7 (BM also told me as much as well).  As much as it made my heart sing that she cared enough about me that calling me mom was something she wanted to do, I know how I would feel if my own biokid called someone else mom and, even though BM *seemed* to be okay with it, I did not feel comfortable letting them start with it and didn't want it to become a weapon for her to pull out of her arsenal at a later date when it suited her to try to hurt my skids or my H.\n\nH and I sat down with them and told them that while it was sweet that they wanted to give me the title of mom, they had one mom and she was the only one who should have that title.  But, that I would love it if they could come up with a name that was special for me that only they called me so everyone would know how special it was.  The youngest came up with calling me by a nickname for my given name that I truly and honestly CANNOT stand (like I will cut you if you call me by that name), but she explained herself that it sounded like Mommy but wasn't actually calling me mommy and in her little bitty baby talk voice, it was actually endearing so that was what I became (and still am 20 years later).  The older one came up with one of her own ... It's \"pretty\" in a foreign language that I speak (not fluently, but sometimes things sound better in another language than they do in English lol) or actually pretty momma but she never really used the momma part. \n\nThe kids are all grown and now, they both refer to me as their mom when talking with their friends and they both call me by the dreaded nickname more often than not.  But now that they are adults, they are better able to check themselves and not call me their mom when speaking with their BM and risk hurting her feelings.", "I am so conflicted here.. \n\nI have my own experience with this, and it's very painful. To this day it causes me bouts of grief and uncontrollable crying.\n\nMy gut tells me \"why should it matter? It's the kids decision\" but due to my specific situation, my mind is saying how dare you, YTA. \n\nIf you care to read about it, I had a fling with a girl when we were both very young and stupid. Neither of us were ready for a child, but she was set on having one, unbeknownst to me. She was still in love with a previous boyfriend, and wanted to have a baby in short order and claim it was his. That's where I came in, young dumb and completely oblivious to her very forward sexual nature. She said she was on the pill, but actually was lying. The condoms I attempted to use broke every time, and I think she was doing something to cause it. \n\nAnyway, she got pregnant, and I was all for helping out despite not having a clue what to do.., but she promptly ended our relationship as soon as she found out. She said she didn't want me to see the baby, or have anything to do with her except for child support money. I asked why she lied about the pill, and was promptly ignored on MySpace, not to be spoken to again. \n\nI knew what was coming so I got a job and apartment as quickly as possible. I began reaching out to the only cell number I had for her with no luck, tried MySpace repeatedly, but no response. I found her on Facebook, and got the same silent treatment for months. She must have had a change of heart, because she reached out and told me that we had a beautiful baby daughter. I'm thrilled and at the same time shocked because I found out my name was not added to the birth certificate. \n\nStill, I was happy to finally see her, we lived so far apart and I made 8$ an hour, so I didn't get to drive down and see her often. I paid as much of my paycheck as I could, about 150 dollars a week, via western union for about 2 years and saw her as often as I could. My brother lost his job, and couldn't pay his half of the rent, so I had to send her less, about 50 bucks a month. She wanted more than what I was paying before, but I just couldn't do it. \n\nAgain, I didn't hear from her, she stopped responding to my Facebook messages and texts/calls. And didn't accept the western unions I was sending. \n\nI looked into free/subsidized legal services, but because she lived in another state, I didn't qualify. \n\nI had the money once to drive my car with overheating issues back to her last address, but she had moved. \n\nThis went on for about 3 years, I found my current wife, who is amazing, and she was able to see her Facebook profile because she wasn't blocked like I was. I saw my now 5 year old daughter and nearly had a breakdown because I was so happy to see her face again in pictures she posted. \n\nWe eventually got a message back from her, stating that my daughter is doing very well, and she's living with a nice man who is a great father who she calls \"daddy\" and that if I want any sort of contact, the money has to flow and it has to be entirely on \"her terms\" which is that I am only to be referred to as a \"friend\".. \n\nYou could hear me scream for miles. I was destroyed. \n\nSince by then, we were in a much better place financially, we layered up and took her to court with piles of evidence of what transpired, it was promptly overlooked by the court and the very most I was able to get was every other weekend visitation. \n\nWe got nothing at all for the alienation and Indoctrination of a child. And I was stuck trying to repair a relationship with my own child. \n\nShe didn't remember me of course, because she was barely 2 the last time I saw her. We met at a restaurant, and I was introduced as a \"nice man who helped make her\"... I was fighting tears and frustration and anger the whole time. I wanted to pick her up and hug her like the last time I saw her but I knew what had been done to her and I didn't want to risk traumatizing her.\n\nIt was a very long road trying to repair our relationship, years before she called me dad... I feel like it was wrong to change how she saw me but it was so wrong what was done to her, replacing me with another man that was not her father. \n\nShes going to turn 16 soon, and to this day, she still sees him and calls him dad, she doesn't think I know, but I do... I feel like she only calls me dad because she knows I'll be hurt if she doesn't. I'm conflicted because it feels like I'm forcing it, but she's my daughter, I never stopped loving her and never stopped trying to find her. Her horrible mother took something from me that she can never give back, and I will never forgive her for it. \n\nI don't know how to process these feelings, so I'm still prone breaking down from time time when I think about it. \n\nSo part of me wants to tell you that you're a really big fucking asshole for taking that from their mother. \n\nOne part of me says that it's OK for the kids to feel that way. \n\nIt's a shitty situation, and clear boundaries need to be set with children. Like \"no I'm not your mother, and could never replace her, but I love you and will take care of you as she would when she's not here to do it.\" \n\nThe title of mother or father is very special, and has to be given in some way if it's ever to change hands.", "ESH - kind of.\n\nI don't think your the Ahole for letting them call you mom, but when Mom expressed her discomfort (and she could've done so in a much better manner) then you should've backed off and you and the kids come up with a different thing to call you.\n\nI'm a step-mom and have 2 boys of my own. My step-son was 10 when I met him. Husband had him on the weekends and he lived with his mom during the week.

If I had a child and they called their step-mom \u201cmom\u201d, as long as their relationship was healthy and step-mom was actually being a part of their lives as a parental figure, then that\u2019s perfectly fine for them to do so.

Deliberately damaging those bonds can cause significant emotional harm to children, and can damage their ability to form healthy emotional bonds with others. \n\nIt is not only extremely normal, and healthy for young children to refer to step parents, as \"mom\" or \"dad\", it is also extremely common, and I always encourage parents who experience this, to allow their children to express those bonds in whatever way feels most comfortable for them, because that is what is best for the *children*. \n\nScreaming at someone you co-parent with, in front of your children, because your feelings are hurt that they have formed a strong bond with another adult support figure in their life, is not only incredibly self centered, and toxic, it is incredibly emotionally damaging to the child.

That yea, it would hurt but I would support them because ultimately, the kids are what matter most.", "YOU are the asshole bro its not like she asked them to call her mom the kids wanna call her mom and the bio mom got unreasonably pissed and op had clearly stated she told the kids shes the \"other mom\" op nta ur stupid", "Definitely one of the most abrasive comment sections I\u2019ve seen yet, though I\u2019m super new to Reddit browsing. As a child of divorced parents- kids are much smarter than they are being given credit for here, even very young kids. \nMy step niece\u2019s father died when she was very little- as a result of that, her moms new marriage, and both sets of grandparents from my step sisters side, niece had 4 sets of grandparents. Adults are the one who make this complicated. Kids are just happy to be loved. \nAll this pitchfork raising over calling her \u201cbio mom\u201d what the heck was she supposed to refer to her as\u2014 my fianc\u00e9s ex the whole time?", "Yeah I\u2019m adopted and use that term for my legit bio mom that gave me up as a baby. Would never dream of using it for a living parent that is actively parenting AND is literally the ONLY mother for these kids. OP, YTA. you\u2019re not their mom.  Maybe it feels good to get little digs at this other woman, but is that really what is most important here? Your ego?", "Step moms who use the term biomom are always inflammatory. It's like a dogwhistle for drama and insecurity.", "She\u2019s only been around for 8 mos lmfao", "So... still not a step parent. And you\u2019re rude.", "She\u2019s trying too hard to paint the mom as a bad person but trying to make her looks like an amazing women that kids are all over her and love her too much have to call her mom right on. But hey, her ugly red flags still shown.", "Dude, honestly, who cares if the BF wants zero involvement with the kids. He's not the dad. I'm a single mom, and my last boyfriend kept trying to impose rules that I should have for my kids or things I should make them do and he didn't even live with us, barely saw my kids. I'd choose uninvolved and out of my parenting business over someone who oversteps boundaries any day. I prefer to parent my own kids. Maybe the mom in this situation does, too. We don't know. \n\nAnd using terms like \"birth giver\" which was used in the comments while saying she is a better mother to the kids is a slippery slope toward alienation. Add in the disrespect of not even having Dad discuss this with their mom, I cannot blame bio mom at all for being upset or accusing alienation. This is exactly how it starts. So I'm seeing more red flags from OP. They may be subtle, but they're there. \n\nAlso, if people are really doing co-parenting right, there should be at least SOME similarity and cohesion in parenting between the households so it's less confusing and more stable for the kids.  So while the other parent doesn't get a say in how things run, they should at least be doing their best to get on the same page.", "More details from her comments she's been daddy's friend for 3 years, youngest kid is 3.. she's been called out on that and no response. I came here to say NTA but after that little detail.. fuck her she has no right toom title", "Yeah she was vague about it too.

Your fianc\u00e9 should apologize to her, too, because he owes her one and because that is what it takes to successfully co-parent: own your missteps and move forward. If she has integrity, she will apologize to both of you for her approach and her mouth.

If he were to break up tomorrow would you still have access to the children, would you even want to? Would he even want you to? You would be a stranger.\n\nRight now it doesn't look that way and hopefully you stay together but there isn't enough commitment and time for them to be calling you mom. Even if there was if Mum is uncomfortable its a no.\n\nAlso you going straight against her wishes will cause problem in the long wrong because you are teaching them  not to listen to their mother.

It\u2019s perfectly okay for them to see you as a maternal figure but if their Mom doesn\u2019t want to share that title then that\u2019s it no sharing. They can refer to you as a stepmom when talking about their parents or who you are to them but you do not get to be called mom. It may seem like the kids understand what\u2019s going on and that you are a bonus mom but they are so little they probably don\u2019t.
