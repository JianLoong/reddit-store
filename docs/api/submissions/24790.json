I have met her and the kids before in person, she came off as a decent person and we never had any issues.\n\nNot an exact measure of time but 2/3 months ago, S would randomly call me \u201cmom\u201d or most commonly, \u201cmomma\u201d like before going to bed as we tuck them in and say our good nights. It was an odd adjustment, but I know they\u2019re little and I mostly brushed it off with a \u201cokay goodnight hunny\u201d. D would only call me \u201cmom\u201d if S did (he\u2019s 3, so imitating).\n\nWell, about a month ago while S was with Dad and I, she asked me if it was okay for her to call me mom. Up until this point really, both kids called me by my legal name and only knew me as daddy\u2019s \u201cspecial friend\u201d since we aren\u2019t officially married yet. \n\nIt was quite a surprise for me ( a sweet one, I should say). Dad and I both explained to them that if they want to call me \u201cmom\u201d, \u201cmomma\u201d, etc, it was okay as long as they wanted to. \n\nS has on her own made it clear (to us, at least) that she has two (2) moms, and one dad (bio moms bf doesn\u2019t want to be involved with the kids). Both kids understand they came from their moms belly, and not mine.\n\nDad I went to drop kids off to mom as usual, no issues. I stay in the car, and she leaves with the kids. Nothing crazy. \n\nAs Dad and I were driving home, mom calls and I told him to answer but let her know she\u2019s on speaker with both of us.

I told her that the kids chose to call me mom, and we explained to them that I\u2019m not their real mom, just an extra mom. She still did not like that, and went on about how it hurts her feelings that the kids are saying she isn\u2019t their mom anymore and all this nonsense. I got firm quickly and explained that I understand why it would hurt her feelings, but I don\u2019t believe what she\u2019s saying because of what I have heard the kids themselves say. I allow the kids to call me mom because they see me as a maternal figure, and it\u2019s about how they feel, not your (her) insecurities. \n\nShe then went on to not only scream at him and i on the phone, but in her car in front of the kids, \u201cYOU BOTH ARE PIECES OF F-ING SHIT AND THESE KIDS ARE MINE NOT YOURS, I HOPE YOU BOTH F-ING GO TO HELL\u201d and honestly I can\u2019t make out much more of what she said as most of it was unintelligible.\n\nAfter the kids weekend with her, they came back & were sad because their bio mom said I\u2019m not allowed to be their mom. I asked them \u201cdo you want me to be your other mom?\u201d. They both said yes.

I understand the question was sudden but you\u2019re an adult and could\u2019ve listened to their thoughts about it and then talked to your fianc\u00e9 who should then relaying and communicate it to mom. \n\nI don\u2019t think the screaming was appropriate but I\u2019d be so angry if my ex told my kids it\u2019s fine to call someone else Daddy without even talking to me regardless of if they\u2019re remarried or not. I agree with Mom ultimately despite the distasteful delivery and probably would of had a similar initial reaction.", "NTA. It's understandable that their mom would be wounded to hear her kids calling someone else 'mom', but the kids are *so* young, if you're marrying their dad they should be able to look to you as a mother figure. At the end of the day, the adults' feelings in this situation come second to the kids' secure attachment.", "Why couldn\u2019t you have come up with a special name like Mom in another language or Ma Ami or something like that? A lot of kids do that for Grandparents   Problem solved", "ESH \n\nThe mom was way out of line to blow up on you like that.\n\nBut do not allow those kids to call you mom. That hurts so bad which is why she is lashing out.", "NTA.  But I have a concern about all of this. You are still in the honeymoon of your relationship with their dad.  Time will tell if an 8 month living together will last. Creating this bond must consider the lasting nature of your relationship with their father. I would soft pedal this until the marriage takes place.", "NTA - She's being possessive over her kids, which is understandable, but she's going about this the wrong way. The kids have so much love in their life they want to call you mother as well as their own mother. She has no actual reason to be threatened. The kids brought this up themselves, and as long as you aren't putting little birdies in their ears about this and coaxing them to call you mom (which would be messed up imo), I think you're in the clear here. The kids can call you what they want to!", "NTA for allowing it, but this was a big mistake for a healthy coparenting relationship. It would have been way better to include their mom in this decision. When they began to call you mom they were 2 and 3 years old. Typically children at that age call people mom, because they do the things a mother would do like make them food, give them a bath or tuck them in at night. The whole stepparent thing is really hard to understand for kids at that age. \n\nUnfortunately now there are a lot of hurt feelings involved, because their mom was ambushed with your decision. She clearly was very wrong for her way to handle the situation. But to stop further escalations you need to meet without the kids and have an honest talk about it. Coparenting is no joke and whenever there are hurt feelings involved the kids are always the ones that have to suffer the most.", "YTA. Especially for referring to their mother as their \u201cbio mom\u201d; a term reserved for markedly different relationships. You\u2019re talking about a woman who has joint custody of her children; not one, who, for example, might receive an annual letter from her offspring\u2019s adoptive parents\u2019 about their progress. Not that those women wouldn\u2019t deserve more consideration than you\u2019ve managed to show here.\n\nDo you genuinely have no concept of \u201cmom\u201d (& associated terms) being a precious designation? Absolutely zero understanding of the level of pain you have caused? It\u2019s perfectly true some children will call a woman other than the one who birthed them \u201cmummy\u201d; but vanishingly rare for that to happen if they retain a relationship with - & here I am using the term correctly - their biological mother.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have said \u201cyes\u201d, you should have asked \u201cwhy?\u201d; & informed the children\u2019s mother. \n\n(I\u2019d not be too overwhelmed with emotion about them calling you mommy at bedtime etc btw: even older children quite routinely call anyone female in a vaguely caring role \u201cmummy\u201d: did you never hear a teacher call a classmate mummy?)\n\nTopping it all off by deciding to tell the children to ignore what their mother had said? How can you possibly think that will end well?\n\nNo, she shouldn\u2019t have used profanities in front of the children, but she\u2019s still not T A. That crown is yours, but your fianc\u00e9 holds the sceptre, given he so willingly facilitated this.", "ESH....the adults should have talked about this together before telling the kids. Mom is Mom, maybe OP is Momma, or Momma \"name\".\n\nAlso, OP referring ro Mom as \"bio mom\" raises some flags. She's Mom, not bio Mom. Or else you should refer to Dad as bio Dad.", "NTA, mom\u2019s ego is bruised and that may be why she lashed out on you. It\u2019s probably very tough to hear her kids calling another person mom. Hopefully y\u2019all can revisit the convo when she calms a bit", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have made the decision of letting the kids call you mom without talking to their actual mother.

You mean when she actually cared about what they want?", "My experience showed me how a person who actually has their kids' best interest in their heart and is able to put their pride aside acts. Part of mutual respect and communication is, for instance, ensuring the same rules apply in both households so that kids have a sense of routine and consistency in their lives (this includes punishments, for instance). It also includes discussing how the kids should be raised and the type of education they should get. Respecting people's feelings is part of that. They should teach the kids they shouldn't make a decision on how to treat the step mother without considering their mother's feelings.", "Never had to, I've never seen the woman with whom my mother cheated on my father as a mother. And still my mother taught me that I should respect the woman because she was my father's new wife. And when they had a kid she taught me that I should treat my new sister as a sister and regardless of my opinion of that woman, because the kid was innocent in all of it.\n\nBecause she knew that teaching me respect was more important.

An adopted parent is the parent, mother and father. A step-parent is different. These children already have a mother and a father, and they will have step-parents alongside that. But they already have a mother.", "That's a highly inappropriate way of expressing her feelings have been hurt at a highly inappropriate time.\n\nWhat a terrible way to model behaviour to the kids. They will learn that this is an acceptable way to express anger because that's what their parent does.\n\nScreaming profanities over speaker while your two kids are in the car is... horrible. \n\nHer feelings are hurt. She needs to work through that in therapy. If she doesn't want the kids calling stepmom mom then they could have come to a compromise.\n\nInstead she told them to go to hell.
