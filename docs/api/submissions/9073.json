Her mom calling you to complain is insane. I guess we can see where your ex-friend's behavior and entitlement come from.", "NTA. \n\nTough love. She needs to get over it and stop doing it. \nThat sounds incredibly frustrating. I'd almost be inclined to block the number temporarily or put my phone on airplane mode to stop the calls coming through. A subtle way of saying fuck off. \nBut it sounds like you've been putting up with it for long enough. Good on you for standing up for yourself and anyone else who gets frustrated by this. \n\nINFO: Have you had this conversation with this friend in the past, regarding the ridiculous phone call habits? What was their excuse for calling you this time? Does her mother know about this rude and frustrating habit? How often does it happen?\n\nAlso, don't feel bad. Focus on your studies. She'll live.\n\nEdit: omg, I just read that you're both 23. There is absolutely no excuse for this immature behaviour. Good lord..", "NTA all the way. Someone had to tell her. I personally would have just blocked her and told her in person next time and that she would stay blocked. Calling twice in a row insinuates an emergency, this is common knowledge and I've made that clear in the past to my own family members.", "NTA. Your friend needed this wake up call.", "Nta.  She needed to understand that what she's doing is rude.  If that's all you said I don't think it was out of line.", "NTA - Tough Love is still Love.  Even if the recipient doesn't see it at first.", "Eh, NTA. I think she needed the wake up call that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her and that it is rude to blow up people\u2019s phones like that for no reason.", "NTA. The fact that her mom called you tells you that she is not mature enough for adult relationships. And mom might be why.", "INFO: have you ever sat her down and told her you don\u2019t like being called over and over? From the way this is written, it sounds like this was an all of a sudden realization for her", "Esh Maybe? \n\nThe way you said it and behaved towards her was downright spiteful and even a little cruel. You lost your temper and whether you feels it\u2019s justified or not you should apologise for the way you spoke to her. \n\nHowever. The fact she does this all the time without considering whether you\u2019re busy or not is incredibly rude and entitled. She is not entitled to your phone and the fact she spam calls it till you answer is harassment.", "ESH, i absolutely HATE it when people call on repeat until you answer. honestly, i hate when they just call twice. it's totally okay to tell her that that is annoying and she should call once or just text because people aren't always available to talk to her immediately. i don't know how old you guys are, but having your mom call a friend is a very childish thing to do.\n\nanyway, you could have been nicer by explaining it to her, but i understand being frustrated with her, especially since this happens often.", "ESH\n\nOP commented below that she and the girl in the story are 23. Sorry but this isn't high school, learn how to communicate. If she's been calling you non-stop like this for a significant period of time, your first address of it shouldn't be to completely blow up on her.\n\n~~You summed it up well. This is classic \"crying wolf\". If it's not an emergency, don't call 5-6 times in a row.~~\n\n~~The fact that your friend had her mom call you afterwards tells me that you are both likely teenagers. I always give the same advice to older teenagers/young adults: be kind. You're not wrong to feel frustrated but she obviously doesn't understand boundaries and an easier answer would be to calmly say, \"Hey if you're going to keep calling me 5-6 times in a row for unimportant things, I'm going to have to block your number\" and leave it at that. You're not saying anything negative about her, but drawing a boundary. It puts the ball back in her court and keeps you from sounding as harsh as you did.~~", "ESH- The only reason I'm saying you suck here too is because you let it go on for this long. Your (ex) friend obviously should know how to take a hint but going forward waiting until you legitimately can't bare it anymore isn't a good way to approach issues in friendships.

Because going from no feedback to rudeness is an AH move. Ignoring calls is passive aggressive . People aren't  mind readers.", "NTA", "NTA that shit is my biggest pet peeve. You\u2019re better off without her and your friend circle. Just keep your distance from her at her drama. I can\u2019t believe she made her mother call you. How old is this chick .", "NTA that is obnoxious.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI understand your frustration, but if you know this is something she does a lot, why not just answer the first time and tell her you don't have time to talk/ politely ask that if you don't answer the first time, then text you?\n\nI have ADHD and deal with Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. The fear of rejection/ failure is strong and causes severe anxiety. I would do this too. If someone didn't answer, I would panic and keep trying. I'm not saying this is def. what your friend is dealing with for sure, but do you know?? A little empathy and actual discussion could go a long way.", "YTA for the way you spoke to her - totally understandable, but still. Although the way you handled it was uncool, I think it\u2019s a good thing to be away from this person. A grown adult has their mom call you??? Or, the mom of an adult takes it upon themselves to call you??? Both scenarios are really cringe. \n\nI am a parent of a young adult and cannot ever imagine in a million years doing such a thing - yikes! \n\nIs this an actual thing that people do? My kid tells me about helicopter parents but I assume this only applies to minors or freshman in college- does this really happen?\n\nJFC, my kid would be mortified and not speaking to me. WTF? Who are these people?", "ESH. \n\nWhen someone has an annoying habit, it's perfectly acceptable to tell them so. What is not acceptable is to be a dick to them out of the blue and act like it's okay. There was a right way and a wrong way to address the issue, and snapping at her and hanging up was not it.", "NTA for being bothered by the calls, but YTA for how handled it,  there was no need to be so rude and hateful about it. Maybe if you would have answered the first call and said you were busy, or put your phone on silent when you don't want to be disturbed.\n\nHowever this is kinda unbelievable because I don't know anyone under 50 who still calls people, everyone texts now.", "Or 100 wake up calls\u2026\u2026..until she answers", "Yo that\u2019s what I said. I lost respect for her for that", "I have brought it up with her a few times before and so did some of our mutual friends. She would say she would work on breaking that habit and things would be fine for like a month before going back to the way they were. When I noticed that pattern I started giving her less and less of my attention", "The repeat calls are (ding!)\n\nright up there with people (ding!)\n\nwho sent a lot of (ding!)\n\ntext fragments to complete their (ding!)\n\nthought (ding!)\n\nsame rage as listening to a dog endlessly lick as you're laying there in the dark, staring at the ceiling, trying to get to sleep.", "I brought it up a couple times before. Definitely should have put that in the original post", "My thing is she\u2019s an adult. We\u2019re 23. She should know better", "We\u2019re not teenagers, but two grown ass women. We\u2019re 23, only a few months difference", "Bad habits are hard to break but she has to understand the frustration, especially when you're in the middle of something important like studying for an exam. \n\nWhen I found out you're both 23, I was gobsmacked. \nI assumed high school age (I mean no offense towards you, mainly your friend)", "Please do add this because most peeps are calling you the AH only because they think you came out harsh as they assumed this was the first time you communicated about it.", "Bawhahaha! Your friend is 23 years old and felt it was necessary idea to have her mum call you up to defend her? Holy shit, I thought she was in middle school!", "I lost all sympathy for her when she tattled on you to mommy. As an adult! Some people don't understand boundaries unless you hit them in the face with them to make the point. I can understand if she's socially awkward or doesn't do well socially that you blowing up at her is the only thing that actually makes the lesson sink in but to turn around complain to her mom?\n\nNTA.", "Omg, I though you were a teenager since her mom call you back for being cruel to her daughter.....\n\nBut indeed, if is the first time you were communicating this to her, the way you did it was not the best.\n\nESH", "Honestly, then you definitely could've been a bit less harsh. You're both old enough to know better.", "While you may be 23, neither of you appear to be grown ass women.", "Oh holy shit I thought OP was  younger too. Oh boy..", "OP added comment that OP and friends had discussed the issue with her.", "I thought these were teenagers too!", "I only half agree with this. They are old enough to be able to handle tough love. However I guess OP could have turned airplane mode or DND on temporarily and then spoke to the friend later once they are finished their study session and had a chance to calm down. But I have a feeling the outcome may have been the same..", "That comment might make me even more of an AH in your eyes but at least I don\u2019t get my mom to fight my battles for me at my big age"]}
