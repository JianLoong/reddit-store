I hate cats. I think their litter boxes are gross and I can\u2019t stand the smell of cat urine.

My siblings and I own our own houses so we\u2019re splitting up out of town family members so no one will have to overpay for hotel rooms. I\u2019m hosting the single cousins so they can have a little fun outside of family time.\n\nMy cousins started to arrive yesterday. Shelby arrived and when I opened the door, I saw her standing there with a big smile, her luggage, and a pet carrier. I pointed to the carrier and asked what\u2019s that. She happily told me that she just adopted a cat and didn\u2019t want to leave it at home with her roommates. I stood at the door for too long without letting her in so things got awkward.\n\nI admit I didn\u2019t have a no pets rule but I didn\u2019t think I had to. I thought that asking the host if they\u2019re cool with pets before bringing them was one of those unwritten rules that people just automatically follow. You know, like you don\u2019t have to tell every adult coming into your house not to pee in the kitchen sink. Besides, no one else brought their pets and a couple of them own dogs.\n\nFinally she asked if she could come in and that brought me back to my senses. I told her I don\u2019t allow pets in my house and that her cat can\u2019t come in. She thought I was joking but when I didn\u2019t move, we started to argue. The other cousins came to see what the commotion was about and in the end, a couple of cousins left with her while the rest remain.\n\nMy parents called to chew me out saying that I could have put up with Shelby and her cat for a couple of days while I argue that it\u2019s rude to bring a pet without asking first. Plus I don\u2019t want my house to smell like cat urine. They said I\u2019m making thanksgiving awkward and now I feel a little bad.

They need a home base to stay in and this is just setting her up to have a very unhappy cat who won't bond. And a just adopted cat is going to have territorial issues right away.

Cat poop does stank when they first bury it, granted, but they don't like to smell their pee any more than you do and use litter religiously unless it's not available. It's equivalent to saying \"I don't want a dog in the house because it's definitely going to shit on the bed.\" You have turned a situation in which you're correct (it's your house, you don't have to host pets, especially without warning) into one in which you're being petulant and giving a terrible reason for *why* you're not hosting that targets the specific pet/pet owner.\n\nSo I'd say ESH; your cousin is being insensitive by bringing a pet without asking, but you're (implicitly) escalating by accusing her of being likely of serious pet neglect as the reason why *she* can't bring a pet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My cat travel list is: their litter box with the litter freshly scooped, his cat bed and binkie/blanket, a couple toys, treats & food. That is a lot more than a kitty carrier!", "NTA Catlover here, I would be pissed as well. You don't just bring your pet without permission. If someone comes to me with a pet they can find another place to stay as well.", "Okay so NTA because it is rude she didn\u2019t ask and it\u2019s your house, end of story. But \u201cmy house to smell like cat urine\u201d rubbed me, a certified cat lady, the wrong way. My cats have never peed anywhere except their boxes and if scooped immediately there\u2019s no smell. A few days probably wouldn\u2019t have killed you, but overall, it\u2019s your decision and if you say no cat, then no cat.", "NTA", "NTA my cat is my baby he acts more like a dog than a cat and I still wouldn't bring him somewhere unless I had prearranged it", "I'm not even sure it's unwritten. You should never bring a pet to someone's without asking. \n\nI'm allergic to cats but even if someone showed up with a dog (and I am one of those people who loves dogs too much) the answer is no. I like my place to be allergen free for guests. And I have 0 trust that someone who brings a pet without warning (especially a brand new one) is going to cover any damages their animal does during the stay.", "I love cats but I would never show up to a friend's or family member's house with my cat unless I got the okay first", "Who wants to bet the roommates weren\u2019t asked too and she didn\u2019t have a choice because they told her they wouldn\u2019t take care of it or would take it to a shelter if she left it with them over the break?", "And I love cats but wouldn't dream of bringing mine somewhere without asking.  Plus, as others point out, cats like routine and generally don't travel well.  \n\nI once had some folks cat-sit for me, when I was going to be gone for several months.  They got a puppy.  Can you imagine, you are suppose to be taking care of 3 cats and you get a puppy?  You are living there temporarily, have no idea where you are going to be in 4 months and you get a puppy.  I was beyond livid.  When I kicked them out (not even due to the puppy) they didn't even take the dog to a shelter.", "And cat urine is sooo hard to get out. I would not risk an accident.", "This right here! Plus the cat being newly adopted may not be fully litter trained. This absolutely horrendous to OP and to the pet. I hope the cousin actually knew what she was getting into by getting a cat. Yes, they are typically easier than dogs, but they are still living creatures with their own personalities, likes, fears, and they don't understand why they are being shipped around like a toy. Newsflash: pets are not toys!", "Had a friend show up unannounced threw my back door right into the kitchen with her dog \"since I never say no to dog sit\". My kids had just finished making chocolate chip cookies and there where chocolate everywhere on the floor. Well, she didn't do that again \ud83d\ude01", "All cats are litter trained within a day or so.  I had a litter of kittens I fostered and they litter trained in a day.  Shelters would have had litterboxes.  What would be more concerning is that stressed cats can eliminate outside the litterbox. A newly adopted cat that is still learning their new environment and then traveling would be a stressed cat.", "I know it was always stressful for all my cats over the years and so they only went into the car for moves or visits to the vet (aka spa day, lol)", "God bless you because all our friends have dogs and twice now one of them has made the assumption that all the dogs will be welcome in our house once it\u2019s done being built. We are a cat family and I\u2019m SEVERELY allergic to dogs, like immunotherapy and carrying and epipen allergic. \n\nIt drives me crazy because I\u2019m expected to suck it up at their house or look like a dick for refusing to go over anymore and now they seem to expect me to compromise my health in my own home. Feels bad man.", "Bot. Comment taken from u/Trin_42.", "Okay, thank you for clearing that up. It's likely the stress I've experienced and not the training. Plus I got my dog more recently than my cat so his potty training is fresher in my mind.", "Yeah, my MIL was the same with her cats. From what I can tell they're often very territorial and being moved stresses them out.\n\nNot all cats, obviously. We take our dogs to a beach near us, and saw a couple having a picnic with their cat. My partner took the dogs on and I chatted with them, apparently their cat had been very adventurous but was coming to the end of his life, so they took him on little excursions as often as they could. It was so sweet! Little black cat just relaxing on a beach towel.", "I'm a crazy cat lady in every sense. \n\nNTA. \n\nYour home is your home. Shelby is TA.", "NTA. I love cats and I would never bring any pet to anyone\u2019s house without clearing it first. Maybe she can trade spots with another family member who didn\u2019t bring a pet.", "I am a cat person who wouldn't want to leave my cat alone either, but I would never dream of just turning up at someone's house with my cat.  I would ask beforehand if my host was OK with it, and respect their choice.  Your house, your rules.  Your cousin's rudeness and entitlement in this scenario is astonishing.  You are totally NTA.", "NTA, no I don't think you should have had to go out of your way to make them no pet rule, if someone was going to bring along their animal they should have asked before just bringing their animal. Your cousin is so weird for just showing up with a cat and expecting it all to be fine. Especially because cats are the type that if they are unsettled they can start marking territory to feel more secure. So basically all of your disgusts to do with cats, would happen in your house", "NTA for all the reasons, but also because cats smell and you can always tell a house that has a cat in it because of the SMELL.", "NTA.  So many people are allergic to cats, it's incredibly rude to show up with a cat when you're invited for the holidays.", "I love cats. I absolutely adore them.  \nShe was 100% out of line to bring her cat to your house without asking, and you are absolutely NTA for refusing to allow the cat in your home.  \nYour cousin and your parents are absolutely bananas.", "NTA from someone who adores cats, that\u2019s just so rude!", "Team cat and you are absolutely NTA.  In addition,  cats are very territorial creatures and do not like being moved out of their home for the most part.", "NTA\n\nI love cats but the cats are NOT dogs. The vast majority of cats can't just be picked up and taken on vacation w/o freaking out about being in a new territory. The chances of them peeing basically anywhere an everywhere are very high.\n\nAnd, she sounds like an ignorant new owner. Was she also carrying a litter box? Litter? Food?  Food and water dishes? \n\nI feel sorry for the kitty.", "NTA. Shelby's parents are family too, right? Why the hell didn't they teach their kid basic manners? Do not bring animals into other people's home without asking first. YOU are correct, Shelby is being rude. You parents are obviously \"don't rock the boat\" people, and we all know how obnoxious that is.", "NTA. As a cat and dog person I agree with you. You're right it is an unwritten rule you don't bring uninvited guests with you. Human or other wise. If your family is so upset over it they can house her and the cat. Like how selfish of her. I'm assuming these plans haven't been last minute. So she could have kenneld the cat or asked the roommates to watch it. She going to be living with them, so the cat needs to get used to them. I'm hoping she didn't get the cat after plans were in process cuz that makes her even worse.", "NTA as one of THOSE \"crazy cat mamas\", I 100% agree with you standing firm. Sure, it hurts to read \"I hate cats\", but I don't like kids so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nKitties are very curious and like to explore. They sometimes destroy when \"hunting\"/playing. Kitties gotta kitty, but not in your space. Thank you for being honest about why the cat wasn't allowed, because it will serve as a reminder for potential future incidents.", "NTA. Not showing up at someone\u2019s house with a pet without asking them first IS one of those rules that all non-AH people *do* follow. Clearly, however, your cousin is an AH. \n\nI\u2019m also struck that she *wasn\u2019t carrying a litter box.* You don\u2019t have cats. What was her plan for that?", "Nope NTA. Even though I disagree with your feelings on cats. It is 100% rude as hell to show up to someone's house with a pet without having asked permission. Cousin can turn her happy behind around and take kitty home. Unless her roommates are complete psychopaths, the cat will be fine. Fun fact: Most cats hate to travel, so your cousin is stressing that cat out way more than letting it spend a quiet night in her bedroom with its food, water, and litterbox.", "NTA. The cousin is entitled, rude and ridiculous.", "ESH - not sure why you have to say you hate cats so many times. Anyone who hates a specific animal for no reason is a walking red flag. \nYour cousin shouldn\u2019t bring an animal without telling you first.", "AND with a cat she just adopted! Who knows if its potty trained even, OP is right to expect cat pee smell ih his house for as long as they stay!", "Yeah, I'm a total cat person but agree OP is 100% NTA. The gall of just showing up with an animal and expecting that to be OK! Unless specifically invited to do so it would never even *occur* to me to bring a pet somewhere.\n\nAlso, this is a recently adopted cat so we don't know how it does with strangers or how likely it is to pee outside the box. Cats can take a while to get used to new people and spaces, and some of them *will* pee outside the box to express their discomfort. She probably hasn't had the cat long enough to know whether it's likely to do this.\n\nFor example, my very special tuxedo boy *hates* when his environment changes, which means that if I dare to move furniture (EVEN IF I PUT IT BACK! like when I clean behind the couch!!) he will poop in between litter boxes to let me know he *could* have pooped in the box but chose not to because He Is Angy. (Yes he regularly goes to the vet and the vet agrees 100% that this behavior comes from spite and nothing else.) She's bringing a new cat into a strange house *full* of strange people; I'd say the likelihood that the cat becomes distressed and decides to pee on something is relatively high.\n\nAlso, I sure as fuck hope she's responsible enough to be *also* traveling with a litter box and cat litter, otherwise she has no business having a cat.\n\n^(edited because I cannot) *^(stand)* ^(an open parenthesis)", "She should never have adopted the cat before immediately going on a trip. Adopt once she was back home and a poor cat had a chance to adjust to its new home.", "NTA. I\u2019m a cat person but I\u2019d never just rock up at someone\u2019s house with my cats and expect them to accommodate us. At the very least your cousin should have contacted you first and she should have been willing to accept a no answer", "I'm a cat person \n\n1000% NTA. Your house, your rules. And who the heck brings a pet to someone's house without asking? If your parents think you should have toughed it out, they can lead by example and let Shelby & her furball stay with them.", "NTA I love cats but would NEVER take a cat to anyone\u2019s house without checking first. Plus if it\u2019s a recent adoption, it may have accidents and be terrified of all the new people and activity. Sounds like there are plenty of other families hosting so she can easily stay with them -especially your parents!", "NTA. As a cat lover currently on the couch with my cat, solid NTA. I can\u2019t imagine bringing even a goldfish without asking permission first. Eek!", "If she simply arrived with a cat  NTA. I love cats myself but you don\u2019t carry them around with you.", "NTA. I am a cat lover but I understand not everyone feels the same way and I respect that. Your cousin imposed her wishes and her pet on you. Cats do shed and if you have a household that has been cat hair free, it's a lot to expect from you suddenly to tolerate cat hair in the air, on your clothes, etc. And FYI cat urine does not smell unless a pet sprays and marks territory. Spayed and neutered cats do not have spraying issues, usually.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine bringing a pet without permission to anyone\u2019s house", "I have a cat and he pees three times a day so that at least six pees worth of cat smell you'd have to put up with.   Not to mention the poop that stinks to high heaven.  Your cousin was hoping she could get away with begging forgiveness instead of asking permission.  NTA - there are plenty of things she could have done with the cat including leaving it at her own home for a couple days.", "Agreed. Not only is it rude, but what if there's an allergy or other health concern? But, regardless, not asking before bringing an animal to someone else's house is an AH move.\n\nOP, you're fine. NTA.", "My uncle tried to do this with a brand new puppy that wasn't even house trained one year. He know's my dad (his BIL) hates animals. When my dad told him to leave the dog outside or go take it to his brother's house and return sans dog (5 miles away and dog friendly), he just got back in his truck and drove straight back home (4 hour trip one way). People are insane about their pets sometimes...", "THIS! NTA I am severely allergic to cats, to the point where my whole face swells, I get hives, and have asthma attacks immediately after breathing somewhere a cat has been. If someone showed up at my house with a cat, after I used my inhaler/downed a bunch of Benadryl, I would be so pissed off.", "I\u2019d rent a giant one just to do this!!", "My feeling is the cat IS family, and so you should ASK before showing up with another family member who is looking to stay at your home. Like, if her cousin brought along another cousin unexpectedly, that'd be very uncool too.", "I travel with my cat all the time. She doesn't care about being on the underground (London's metro), bus, the train or car. And I adopted her when she was 16 years old already.\n\nMy cat is not arsed about the change, she mainly cares about being able to see for the first day in a new environment. After she doesn't even give a fuck about me anymore.\n\nMy cousin also travels with her cat everywhere. The little fucker thrives with new people...\n\n\nI really depends on the cat's temper, their confidence, if they were used to travel while young, and most importantly - if they love their pet carrier. My cat loves sitting in it when we travel, my cousin's cat sleeps in it even at home"]}
