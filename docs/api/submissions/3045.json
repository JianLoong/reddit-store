I hate cats. I think their litter boxes are gross and I can\u2019t stand the smell of cat urine. Also, everyone involved in this situation are adults.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve gotten that out of the way, here\u2019s my problem. \n\nMy parents are hosting thanksgiving this year and they invited immediate and extended family, it\u2019s going to be huge. My siblings and I own our own houses so we\u2019re splitting up out of town family members so no one will have to overpay for hotel rooms. I\u2019m hosting the single cousins so they can have a little fun outside of family time.\n\nMy cousins started to arrive yesterday. Shelby arrived and when I opened the door, I saw her standing there with a big smile, her luggage, and a pet carrier. I pointed to the carrier and asked what\u2019s that. She happily told me that she just adopted a cat and didn\u2019t want to leave it at home with her roommates. I stood at the door for too long without letting her in so things got awkward.\n\nI admit I didn\u2019t have a no pets rule but I didn\u2019t think I had to. I thought that asking the host if they\u2019re cool with pets before bringing them was one of those unwritten rules that people just automatically follow. You know, like you don\u2019t have to tell every adult coming into your house not to pee in the kitchen sink. Besides, no one else brought their pets and a couple of them own dogs.\n\nFinally she asked if she could come in and that brought me back to my senses. I told her I don\u2019t allow pets in my house and that her cat can\u2019t come in. She thought I was joking but when I didn\u2019t move, we started to argue. The other cousins came to see what the commotion was about and in the end, a couple of cousins left with her while the rest remain.\n\nMy parents called to chew me out saying that I could have put up with Shelby and her cat for a couple of days while I argue that it\u2019s rude to bring a pet without asking first. Plus I don\u2019t want my house to smell like cat urine. They said I\u2019m making thanksgiving awkward and now I feel a little bad. I don\u2019t feel bad enough to let Shelby and her cat in though.\n\nAITA for not letting my cousin and her cat to stay at my house because I hate cats?", "created_utc": 1669213994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2qnhk/aita_for_not_letting_my_cousin_and_her_cat_to/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you keep it clean (clean twice a day) you'll barely smell it.

We don't play favorites here.\"", "NTA\n\nTo quote Jackson Galaxy, CAT IS NOT A DOG! They do not do well with constantly changing homes. They need a home base to stay in and this is just setting her up to have a very unhappy cat who won't bond. And a just adopted cat is going to have territorial issues right away. She's starting off as a very bad cat owner.

Cat poop does stank when they first bury it, granted, but they don't like to smell their pee any more than you do and use litter religiously unless it's not available. It's equivalent to saying \"I don't want a dog in the house because it's definitely going to shit on the bed.\" You have turned a situation in which you're correct (it's your house, you don't have to host pets, especially without warning) into one in which you're being petulant and giving a terrible reason for *why* you're not hosting that targets the specific pet/pet owner.\n\nSo I'd say ESH; your cousin is being insensitive by bringing a pet without asking, but you're (implicitly) escalating by accusing her of being likely of serious pet neglect as the reason why *she* can't bring a pet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
