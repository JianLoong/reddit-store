I hate cats. I think their litter boxes are gross and I can\u2019t stand the smell of cat urine.

My siblings and I own our own houses so we\u2019re splitting up out of town family members so no one will have to overpay for hotel rooms. I\u2019m hosting the single cousins so they can have a little fun outside of family time.\n\nMy cousins started to arrive yesterday. Shelby arrived and when I opened the door, I saw her standing there with a big smile, her luggage, and a pet carrier. I pointed to the carrier and asked what\u2019s that. She happily told me that she just adopted a cat and didn\u2019t want to leave it at home with her roommates. I stood at the door for too long without letting her in so things got awkward.\n\nI admit I didn\u2019t have a no pets rule but I didn\u2019t think I had to. I thought that asking the host if they\u2019re cool with pets before bringing them was one of those unwritten rules that people just automatically follow. You know, like you don\u2019t have to tell every adult coming into your house not to pee in the kitchen sink. Besides, no one else brought their pets and a couple of them own dogs.\n\nFinally she asked if she could come in and that brought me back to my senses. I told her I don\u2019t allow pets in my house and that her cat can\u2019t come in. She thought I was joking but when I didn\u2019t move, we started to argue. The other cousins came to see what the commotion was about and in the end, a couple of cousins left with her while the rest remain.\n\nMy parents called to chew me out saying that I could have put up with Shelby and her cat for a couple of days while I argue that it\u2019s rude to bring a pet without asking first. Plus I don\u2019t want my house to smell like cat urine. They said I\u2019m making thanksgiving awkward and now I feel a little bad.

They need a home base to stay in and this is just setting her up to have a very unhappy cat who won't bond. And a just adopted cat is going to have territorial issues right away.

Cat poop does stank when they first bury it, granted, but they don't like to smell their pee any more than you do and use litter religiously unless it's not available. It's equivalent to saying \"I don't want a dog in the house because it's definitely going to shit on the bed.\" You have turned a situation in which you're correct (it's your house, you don't have to host pets, especially without warning) into one in which you're being petulant and giving a terrible reason for *why* you're not hosting that targets the specific pet/pet owner.\n\nSo I'd say ESH; your cousin is being insensitive by bringing a pet without asking, but you're (implicitly) escalating by accusing her of being likely of serious pet neglect as the reason why *she* can't bring a pet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents and other relatives who side with Shelby are disrespecting you.  YOU ARE NOT making the holiday awkward - Shelby is doing that.", "NTA.  You do not just show up with a pet to a house without asking if it is okay first.  This allows the host to let you know if they have an issue so you can make plans accordingly.  Plus, most people who do not have pets don't have their house pet proof, meaning the pet will be in danger.", "NTA - my dog is wonderful, and everyone loves him, and I ALWAYS ask if I can bring him places where he doesn't already have an explicit invitation, even if he's been welcome before.", "I absolutely love cats but you're NTA, your cousin is for putting the cat through all that damn stress when the poor thing just got adopted from the shelter which probably also sucked. She should have just stayed home or better yet waited until AFTER the holidays to adopt the kitty. Or just leave it at home to get settled in, if you don't trsur your roommates around the cat why live them in the first place?", "NTA.\n\nI love cats. Can\u2019t have any because my daughter is allergic. Would never think I could show up to someone else\u2019s home with a pet without asking if I could bring said pet beforehand. Anyone who thinks otherwise can go kick rocks or touch grass.", "NTA seems like the rest of your family is going to put her up. That was pretty rude on her he cousins part.", "NTA and I have a cat, I would never just bring him to someone home without asking first. When I go away he stays with family members", "NTA", ">My parents called to chew me out saying that I could have put up with Shelby and her cat for a couple of days while I argue that it\u2019s rude to bring a pet without asking first. \n\n\"Parents, sounds like you're cool with the cat being in your home.  When you learned I wasn't, why didn't you volunteer to house Shelby and her cat?\"\n\nNTA", "I love cats and even I would be SHOCKED if someone just showed up with their cat. I would be able to easily accommodate them, but frankly, it's not even about it being a cat specifically. She showed up with an entire extra guest without asking! NTA", "NTA have two cats whom I love and they\u2019d freak out if they had to go to a stranger\u2019s house, a) she should\u2019ve called beforehand and b) her roommate could take care of the cat for a couple of days", "NTA. No houseguest should arrive with a pet without permission. Cousin is a totally tool and idiot for thinking otherwise. And not even a cat that she she knows is well-behaved - straight from the foster! A pet owner can pay for their pet boarding when the owner is away.\n\nYour parents are too much of a doormat lol. I can\u2019t imagine any parent accommodating that.", "NTA. It is rude to just show up with pets. Especially when the host dislikes your animal of choice.", "Not the AH.  Your house, your rules and to just show up with a pet without asking is just plain rude.   Tell your parents that you agree Shelby is making tgiving ackward, but you\u2019ll forgive her\u2026..if they try to blame you, tell them you weren\u2019t raised to be a doormat and your place is for SINGLE cousins, not cousins with kids, furry or non.  Stick to your guns, or you\u2019ll smell that cat forever.    And, by the way, I\u2019m an animal lover who usually puts my fur babies above furless people\u2026.but you do NOT go to someone\u2019s house with a pet of any type without checking with the host FIRST.   NTA", "NTA.  What if someone in your household had an allergy?  The audacity of her to bring a cat to your home without asking.   Sounds like she can stay with the other family members.", "NTA in the slightest bit\u2026 I have a cat and a dog but I know that if I\u2019m staying with someone I\u2019m going to ask in advance to see if I can bring them along with me\u2026 that\u2019s just called courtesy", "Who the hell brings a pet to someone's house and doesn't ask them for permission first?! I need to stop reading this subreddit, lol. Also who travels with a new pet - that must be an additional stress for the animal. And there is no guarantee the cat wouldn't pee all over the place - just adopted, plonked in a new environment. Like WTF. NTA OP.\n\nEDIT: And I'm a huge cat lover, lol.", "I love cats, but you are 100%  orrect. Its uncalled for and extremely presumtious to bring a pet to someones house without permission and askinf first.she is the 110% asshole!", "NTA I have pets but there is no way in hell I would allow a strange cat to stay at my house, that cat would be stressed out, pee everywhere, scratch up the place and would be miserable. You don\u2019t just bring a cat to a new place and expect it to go well. The nerve!", "Im a huge cat lover. And I think the litter is gross and I hate the smell of cat piss too.\n\nI only put up with it because I love cats. I could not imagine trying to force it on someone else who didnt love cats.\n\nAnd Ive never brought a cat anywhere without asking first if the cat was welcome.\n\nNTA. She was just rude and entitled all over the place.\n\n(Also: did she even bring a litter with her? Where was this cat supposed to pee?)", "Nta. I have cats and dogs, and would never go to someone's house with them without asking. If nothing else, she doesn't know what allergies people may have that are staying there.", "NTA. I have a cat. I adore cats. But I would never bring my cat to someone's house without asking first. I would feel the same way if someone brought their dog or other animal to my house and assumed it was ok to bring it in without asking.", "NTA.  If a guest wants to bring a pet, they should ALWAYS ask the host first.", "NTA\n\nPeople are stupid about their pets. She 100% should have asked you beforehand but didn\u2019t want to chance you saying no. This was her playing the \u2018better to ask forgiveness than permission\u2019 card and she lost.", "NTA.  I can't imagine just showing up at someone's house with my pet in tow and hadn't asked them for permission.  How incredibly rude and entitled.  She didn't want to leave the cat with her roommates, then she should have left the cat at a kennel (they are not only for dogs) or at least asked OP if she was ok with it.\n\nI am fairly allergic to cats but can survive with allergy pills.  My little sister's allergies are so bad that after 2 minutes in the house, she'd have to leave as she would start swelling up and have a hard time breathing.  To go to someone elses house and not even ask is so inconsiderate.\n\nYou were right to give her the boot.", "YTA. My aunt hates cats and took in a family from Ukraine with cats.\n\nAnd you can't even do it for family", "The \"just adopted\" part makes it worse! Poor cat is already trying to adjust to a new home, new routines, new people, when suddenly they're moved somewhere new *again* (with the stress of a long car ride or even a flight), and they're now surrounded by a ton of unknown people! A dog might be better able to handle it, but I've never met a cat who liked upheaval.", "Shit, I have a cat and i make sure to let people know before they come to my house in case they have allergies. The absolute audacity. \n\nNTA", "It\u2019d be funny if OP showed up at cousin\u2019s house with a snake or something. Thanks for letting me stay! So glad you\u2019re cool with unexpected pets. Just adopted this big boy.", "This. OP, I ADORE cats, and I'd never pull this on someone. My cats occasionally throw up on the carpet, sometimes they're messy, and sometimes they scratch stuff, I'd never bring them to someone else's home unless I had no other choice AND they gave me permission.\n\nAnd to be fair, I would never be okay with someone showing up to my house with their cat or dog.", "\u201cBuT iTs fAmiLy!!!!!\u201d\n\nEff all that. NTA and it IS rude to show up and not ask if it\u2019s ok to bring a pet. THE AUDACITY UGH", "Yep, and he's not going to have a litter box set out, so guess what's going to happen", "NTA, she brought a pet carrier, but did she also bring a litter box, a scratch post?", "Absolutely, I have two sweet dogs, but have always asked first, would never show up unannounced.", "Then when they do it next time you say \"ok but next time the answer is no\" then you do it every year until they have the argument you always allow them to bring their cat. Nope NTA.", "From what I've been told, travel is very stressful for most cats, so it would never occur to me that a guest would show up with a cat in general, let alone without asking first.", "NTA, I\u2019m a huge animal lover and seeing how my dog gets along well with other animals,", "We got hit with a gnarly ice storm last winter and were without power. My parents are NOT cat people. They have a generator and told us to pack up the critters and bring them over, something we never expected of them (to bring the cats over, the  humans, totally), and I was a nervous wreck- because last thing I wanted, was for one of my cats to \"mark\" my parents' house. Fortunately they were good, but no, one should NEVER assume their critter will be OK to just be brought over", "See, Ill go the other way. Ive also had cats for a couple of decades now. Except I bring my cats all over the place. Had one cat, I strapped his carrier to my bike and Id bike him over to my parent's or GF at the time. A few cats now, Id pack up the carrier, take em across town on the metro, put em in a harness/leash and have a picnic in the park. Another, I lived down the hall from my buddy. That cat was back and forth so much he learned how to paw our doors open to come and go as he pleased.\n\nAnd I still wouldnt show up with a cat without asking first!!", "Even if it is someone you know you still need to ask rather than just assume it\u2019s okay. My brother brings the family dog to Thanksgiving at my sister\u2019s every year and she loathes the dog and complains about our brother\u2019s rudeness until Christmas. I don\u2019t have much sympathy because she never set the boundary (too chicken), but he should have asked rather than assumed that first time it happened. Even though we grew up with dogs my sister isn\u2019t an animal person at all."]}
