He was so rude for screaming at you and you were so kind for not humiliating him.", "NTA. If he is scared of dogs and dogs are allowed in your building, then he needs to avoid the dogs. It\u2019s not incumbent on you to get out of his way.", "NTA if they have a problem with dog they should wait until the elevator is free and not to push themselves into small elevator with a big dog and be rude about situation they put themselves into.

I definitely wouldn\u2019t have been comfortable with someone yelling at me about my dog at all.", "NTA. You were waiting first.", "NTA. He saw the dog. He could\u2019ve chosen not to ride the elevator with you.", "Nah, the one who has a problem is the one who has to leave", "NTA. \n\nThe guy could\u2019ve waited or taken the stairs. \nThe moment he yelled I would\u2019ve punched the button to stop at the next floor and invited him to step off the lift immediately.", "NTA\n\nIf that person didn't wanted to be near a dog then he simply shouldn't have taken the same elevator when there already is a dog inside duh.\n\nSome people just can't be helped.", "NTA, have seen a ton of posts like this.

It\u2019s not like you were hiding the husky until the doors closed and then surprised him with it. He could have waited if it was that big of an issue. \nI\u2019m guessing he maybe has some kind of mental health issue? If you frequently cross paths at elevator time, you could let him go first, just to be kind.", "NTA ..the gentleman had every opportunity to remove himself from the elevator. He chose instead to stay and act foolish. ( Don't get me wrong I understand phobias are real ..his yelling was the foolish part not his mental health). \nYou could have gotten off as well , but somehow I feel had you, you would have to every time you shared the elevator with him.", "NTA. I am also scared of dogs despite loving them a lot. But I won't be screaming at some person and their dog like this. I understand that phobias are intense but they could have waited for the elevator to clear considering you were there first. And if they were in a hurry then they could have taken stairs as well.", "NTA. If he was that fussy about it he should have turned around and exited the elevator.", "From the way this is worded it seems like he saw that the elevator was leaving and rushed to catch it not realizing a dog was already in there.\n\nHe probably has a dog phobia and was terrified. He probably wasn't even thinking beyond his fear or he would have simply just got off. \n\nNAH. He told you yo keep your dog away  you kept your dog away. There is no conflict here. \n\nHad he demanded you get off or something then yea he'd be T A but again I chalk his response up to a fear response. We aren't always able to control or think clearly dyring our fear response", "That\u2019s a him problem, not a you problem. He doesn\u2019t like it, he doesn\u2019t need to get in. NTA.", "NTA. You didn't know he'd freak like that. He could've said smth before jumping in with you. I am a dog owner as well, and I know what it's like when people suddenly act panicky around my black lab. I honestly try to avoid bringing other non dog people in these situations. Personally, I find that other people didn't choose to have dogs, we did, and that's why we should try and think one step ahead. I would've perhaps proactively asked if he's alright with the dog, and if not, I'd have waited or used the stairs.", "Hahahaha\n\nHe's so ridiculous.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI was going to say that he should have left at the next floor but maybe his fear is preventing him from acting.\n\nNot your fault anyway.", "NAH. You did nothing wrong. I\u2019m going to assume he either didn\u2019t see the dog before entering the elevator, or maybe misjudged his level of discomfort and panicked once he was stuck. He shouldn\u2019t have yelled, but was panicky and over reacted. A forgivable miscalculation.", "He came into the lift and yelled at you?? I'm confused on how such a cramped elevator could even HOLD two people and a Husky, but maybe it's more a weight capacity thing than a space thing.\n\nEither way, sounds like the dude was either going through or on something. Nothing to do with you, you can put the incident out of your mind. NTA", "NAH. No reason for you to have gotten out. Certainly he saw that there was a dog in there before he got in, but maybe he was in a hurry and thought he could deal with it. Until he couldn't and it was too late to get out. He clearly was afraid and that makes people behave in strange ways, not that I'm excusing him yelling at you.", "Yeah, it is a pet-friendly complex.", "This. I wish it was a rule everyone respected. When I see someone boarding our elevator, I just pretend I am not using it and would never get in, Only in a few instances there is a lady calls and asks me if I want to board the elevator because he loves my dog and she pets him until we arrive.", "Well that is not how i would say it. But as the guy saw the dog before going into the elevator he could just have waited for the next if he is so scared of dogs\u2026 see no problem there.", "Yup , I see many of those owners all around, But We were cornered, thats the thing, My dog stood up to reposition himself in the corner and it scared him.", "Yeah, it's a small building and we cross paths every now and then but not too frequently, It's just that the whole interaction was quite bizarre.", "The elevator was not there yet when he arrived, We were waiting outside, I and My dog were in front of the elevator waiting when he arrived.", "even if he jumped in right after you? I didn't even think he wants to use the elevator when he was approaching, I thought he is just trying to head out, but no, he came straight inside the elevator.  As he was approaching us, he just entered the elevator very casually.", "He definitely saw the dog actually, He has always seen me with a dog. But I guess he panicked.", "I just measured the elevator. It is 1.4X0.8 Meters.", "The thing is, he has always seen me with my dog, Apparently, because my dog looked at him and sniffed him, it scared him.", "Has it never happened before? Like, has he previously been in close proximity to your dog before without it being an issue?", "Phew, that is pretty cramped. Still NTA, the elevator size wouldn't change that.", "People should just grow up. Seriously. You did nothing wrong", "NTA if he saw the dog before he entered the elevator, then he knows what he is getting himself into. As a person with a phobia, I'd have thought the first instinct is to get away from the thing you were afraid of (ie either not get into the elevator with you, or press any upcoming floor to leave the elevator asap).\n\nMy understanding though, based on your post and comments, is that he might've been specifically afraid of your dog in this instance. You say he always sees you with the dog, but was this the first instance he was up close with your dog that s/he got curious enough to look at this guy and was able to sniff him? If so, it might explain why the dog didn't bother him before and why he panicked this time.\n\nThe question now is how did you react? Because if the dog was leashed, and you didn't at least try to communicate with him that this dog is friendly (I'm assuming the dog is friendly), or try to keep the dog occupied so s/he wouldn't focus on the man, you softly M B T A H.\n\nETA under no circumstance was it correct for you to leave the elevator as you were there first, unless you wanted to be kind. But you staying in that elevator does not make you an AH.", "I remember him avoiding my dog carefully, but today I didn't expect him to follow us in the elevator.", "My dog is really big, he is a massive Siberian husky, he just turned his head toward him and things went south for us. feeling so sad.", "The sniffing was not up close, There was about 50 cm of distance between my dog and him, My dog never got even close to him. The dog was just sitting there. He just looked at him and sniffed him from far.", "Yeah. I\u2019m thinking mental issues. Avoid when possible, lest he somehow bait the dog and then call the cops. Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "Your dog didn't do anything bad he just wanted to know who is in the very closed space with him. It's like someone woud be angry at other humans that they look at people in close distance.", "NTA. We're in charge of our own mental health problems *and* you were in there first.", "NTA first come first served", "NTA, if he has dog phobia he could've used the stairs or just waited. You were already in the elevator when he got in.", "I don't like dogs.  I know!  I'll get in this tiny elevator with the man who was there ahead of me with his dog.  Maybe if I say, \"Keep your dog away from me!\" over and over he'll jump out with his dog so I can ride alone.  Because God forbid I should have to wait for the next elevator.\n\nGood grief!\n\nNTA", "NTA he could have waited for the next lift or took the stairs he chose to get in a small space with a dog", "NTA. You and your dog were first in line. If you don't like being in an elevator with a big dog, don't go into an elevator with a big dog. Your neighbor caused this problem himself. Waiting for the elevator to return was a valid option that he did not choose.", "NTA\n\nHe could have/should have waited for the next one, he put himself in that situation as you were there before he was. His constant yelling was just adding to his anxiety.\n\nI don't see any issue with your behaviour and I assume your dog was well behaved and did not in fact have anything to do with this person's outburts.", "NTA. He should of just not gotten on the lift. Not your problem. Also I love huskies. I miss mine. I would be in the floor of the lift with that dog .. obviously with your permission. But ya this is a him problem. Not a you problem.", "NTA he should\u2019ve waited for the next elevator", "NTA   \nStupid people do stupid things don't let it bother you", "Nah, that's what I mean. I'd *usually* try to avoid that, but you are obviously NTA if he just joins you like that. He clearly panicked. It's just a very unlucky situation, I'd say, and try not to think about it further. Just next, you see that person you'll know", "Yeah, honestly I would do the same in the future. No perfectly healthy person who is afraid of dogs would get into a small elevator with one. You can be right, but do you really want to deal with what an unwell person could put you through?", "YTA for having a husky living in an apartment. That poor dog.", "nta", "Nta. As long as your dog was leashed and was under control, you were doing everything right.", "NTA, first come first served.", "NTA\n\nI have lived in apartments for 15 years now. If I need to use the elevator and I don't want to ride with a certain person that is already there because of anything (bad smell, to much groceries, etc), I just wait for another one. \n\nAlso, I have a greyhound similar to a whippet size. If I can wait for another elevator with my dog as a way not to bother the people that are already riding it, then this person could also do it....and that even when the elevators at my building are way bigger.", "NTA. You were there first, no reason why you should have waited for the elevator next time around. No excuses for him, he shouldn't get in an elevator with a dog in it when he is afraid of dogs...or just doesn't like them.", "NTA. In theory you could (though I would not say \"should\") have handled it differently. You could have asked the other guy to use his head and not get into the lift with a dog next time if he's afraid of them. But then there's no telling how crazy some people are. Anyway, no, you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA - he could have waited the extra minute if he's so scared of dogs. I'm scared of dogs and I avoid them for this very reason.", "Nta he could have waited if he didn't want to get on with your dog", "Good lord, not this post again.", "NTA. I have a severe cat allergy. A lady in a building that allowed pets was carrying her cat in a carrier when I went to get in. I mentioned the allergy quickly just to not confuse people why I wasn't getting on, she apologized, I said it wasn't a problem and I would wait and that was that.\n\nRule of thumb I use is whoever was there first has right of way. If someone with a cat tries to get on, I would ask if they could wait for the next one. If they refused though I wouldn't bother arguing about it.", "NTA, he could've taken the next one", "NTA", "NTA. How were you supposed to know about his phobia? He never told you beforehand. Even if you knew - he entered on his own free will, Again: what were you supposed to do once he was in the elevator? YOu could have tried to place your dog in the corner and yourself between doggo and neighbor, but then, it wouldn't have been much of a difference within a small elevator.", "NTA. You were there first. If he really had an issue then he should have stepped out and waited or taken the stairs or something.", "NTA.  You were both waiting for the elevator.  If he didn't want to ride with a dog, then he could have either waited for the next one, or taken the stairs. He sounds like an AH. You did nothing wrong", "Hell no he can wait", "If he was afraid of dogs, he could have waited for the next elevator. You were there first. NTA.", "NTA. He chose to get in that elevator and was stupid to do so if he has a phobia. He doesn't have a handicap that would give him priority, either, he did t need to go first.", "NTA dog or not he could\u2019ve waited for the next elevator ride. He chose to get on knowing that there was a individual with a dog in there. What a weirdo that guy is.", "NTa. They saw the dog and new what they were getting themselves into. (I strongly assume that your dog is well-behaved, even around weirdos.)", "NTA, he chose to enter the elevator with you, it's not on you and your dog to accommodate him after that. \n\nBut how the hell do you manage to keep a husky in an apartment? I'm imagining a mini warzone here lol.", "NTA If he didn't want to be on the elevator with a dog, he could have waited.  You were there first.", "Well, if you search this reddit for elevator and dog you'll find most of the judgements are as consistent as the repeats of this post.", "NTA he needed to wait for the next one.", "NTA\n\nIf someone has a dog phobia and sees there is a dog in the elevator, they should wait for the next one. \n\nFirst come, first served. You were waiting there first.", "This is a simple one! NTA. Doesn't want the dog, doesn't get in with the dog. Not rocket science.", "NTA. He's presumably living in a dog friendly building. If he has a phobia he needs to use the stairs or wait for the next elevator.", "I'd have yelled right back. NTA. If the dog was behaving there was no need for him to make a scene. And if he's that scared HE should have waited for you to go up and for the elevator to come back empty.", "NTA\n\nYou should have calmly reassured him \"Sir, you have nothing to worry about, my dog isn't a shit eater.\"", "nta", "NTA. Why would he jump in with you then get dramatic? Your poor dog was probably thinking the guy was nuts! Lol!", "NTA. If he is scared of dogs he should wait for the next elevator.", "NTA. You were there first, he entered knowing the size of the lift and couldn't have missed the husky. \n\nAlso if he's scared of dogs, as an adult he should know better than to start yelling at you with the dog. Couldn't blame the dog if he responded by either standing or growling/barking", "INFO Did you block him in the corner or was your dog between him and you rather than you between the person and dog.  Because I think it is just manners to keep dogs away from people unless they indicate that they don't mind.  I think this may be NAH because people can't help their phobias and he probably didn't notice the dog until he was in the lift and trapped with it.", "Depending on how good your dog is at listening to commands, I would\u2019ve dropped the leash and scared the shit out of the dude if he wanted to talk to me like that when I was in the elevator first \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f if I dropped my dogs leash he\u2019d just sit there and stare at him \ud83d\ude02", " \nYou were already in the elevator when he entered.", "I'd love a surprise Husky", "You don't want to do that in confined space with an already aggressive, potentially mentally not well person.", " \n\nI'm assuming your dog is well behaved and actually has nothing to do with this person's tantrums.", "Well no, the guy entered WITH them when the elevator arrived and then he freaked out.", "It's so weird, unless your dog is the smallest in existence, how can you miss a whole husky when entering a tiny 2-persons elevator?", "I\u2019m just picturing some guy opening his trench coat to reveal a full grown husky. \u201cHey, buddy.
