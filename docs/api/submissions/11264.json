It\u2019s not like you were hiding the husky until the doors closed and then surprised him with it. He could have waited if it was that big of an issue. \nI\u2019m guessing he maybe has some kind of mental health issue? If you frequently cross paths at elevator time, you could let him go first, just to be kind.", "NTA ..the gentleman had every opportunity to remove himself from the elevator. He chose instead to stay and act foolish. ( Don't get me wrong I understand phobias are real ..his yelling was the foolish part not his mental health). \nYou could have gotten off as well , but somehow I feel had you, you would have to every time you shared the elevator with him.", "NTA. I am also scared of dogs despite loving them a lot. But I won't be screaming at some person and their dog like this. I understand that phobias are intense but they could have waited for the elevator to clear considering you were there first.

If he was that fussy about it he should have turned around and exited the elevator.", "From the way this is worded it seems like he saw that the elevator was leaving and rushed to catch it not realizing a dog was already in there.\n\nHe probably has a dog phobia and was terrified. He probably wasn't even thinking beyond his fear or he would have simply just got off. \n\nNAH. He told you yo keep your dog away  you kept your dog away. There is no conflict here. \n\nHad he demanded you get off or something then yea he'd be T A but again I chalk his response up to a fear response.

You didn't know he'd freak like that. He could've said smth before jumping in with you. I am a dog owner as well, and I know what it's like when people suddenly act panicky around my black lab. I honestly try to avoid bringing other non dog people in these situations. Personally, I find that other people didn't choose to have dogs, we did, and that's why we should try and think one step ahead. I would've perhaps proactively asked if he's alright with the dog, and if not, I'd have waited or used the stairs.", "Hahahaha\n\nHe's so ridiculous.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI was going to say that he should have left at the next floor but maybe his fear is preventing him from acting.\n\nNot your fault anyway.", "NAH. You did nothing wrong. I\u2019m going to assume he either didn\u2019t see the dog before entering the elevator, or maybe misjudged his level of discomfort and panicked once he was stuck. He shouldn\u2019t have yelled, but was panicky and over reacted. A forgivable miscalculation.", "He came into the lift and yelled at you?? I'm confused on how such a cramped elevator could even HOLD two people and a Husky, but maybe it's more a weight capacity thing than a space thing.\n\nEither way, sounds like the dude was either going through or on something. Nothing to do with you, you can put the incident out of your mind. NTA", "NAH. No reason for you to have gotten out. Certainly he saw that there was a dog in there before he got in, but maybe he was in a hurry and thought he could deal with it. Until he couldn't and it was too late to get out. He clearly was afraid and that makes people behave in strange ways, not that I'm excusing him yelling at you.", "Yeah, it is a pet-friendly complex.", "This. I wish it was a rule everyone respected. When I see someone boarding our elevator, I just pretend I am not using it and would never get in, Only in a few instances there is a lady calls and asks me if I want to board the elevator because he loves my dog and she pets him until we arrive.", "Well that is not how i would say it. But as the guy saw the dog before going into the elevator he could just have waited for the next if he is so scared of dogs\u2026 see no problem there.", "Yup , I see many of those owners all around, But We were cornered, thats the thing, My dog stood up to reposition himself in the corner and it scared him.", "Yeah, it's a small building and we cross paths every now and then but not too frequently, It's just that the whole interaction was quite bizarre.", "The elevator was not there yet when he arrived, We were waiting outside, I and My dog were in front of the elevator waiting when he arrived.", "even if he jumped in right after you? I didn't even think he wants to use the elevator when he was approaching, I thought he is just trying to head out, but no, he came straight inside the elevator.  As he was approaching us, he just entered the elevator very casually.", "He definitely saw the dog actually, He has always seen me with a dog. But I guess he panicked.", "I just measured the elevator. It is 1.4X0.8 Meters.", "The thing is, he has always seen me with my dog, Apparently, because my dog looked at him and sniffed him, it scared him.", "Has it never happened before? Like, has he previously been in close proximity to your dog before without it being an issue?", "Phew, that is pretty cramped. Still NTA, the elevator size wouldn't change that.", "People should just grow up. Seriously. You did nothing wrong", "NTA if he saw the dog before he entered the elevator, then he knows what he is getting himself into. As a person with a phobia, I'd have thought the first instinct is to get away from the thing you were afraid of (ie either not get into the elevator with you, or press any upcoming floor to leave the elevator asap).\n\nMy understanding though, based on your post and comments, is that he might've been specifically afraid of your dog in this instance. You say he always sees you with the dog, but was this the first instance he was up close with your dog that s/he got curious enough to look at this guy and was able to sniff him? If so, it might explain why the dog didn't bother him before and why he panicked this time.\n\nThe question now is how did you react? Because if the dog was leashed, and you didn't at least try to communicate with him that this dog is friendly (I'm assuming the dog is friendly), or try to keep the dog occupied so s/he wouldn't focus on the man, you softly M B T A H.\n\nETA under no circumstance was it correct for you to leave the elevator as you were there first, unless you wanted to be kind. But you staying in that elevator does not make you an AH.", "I remember him avoiding my dog carefully, but today I didn't expect him to follow us in the elevator.", "My dog is really big, he is a massive Siberian husky, he just turned his head toward him and things went south for us. feeling so sad.", "The sniffing was not up close, There was about 50 cm of distance between my dog and him, My dog never got even close to him.

I'd *usually* try to avoid that, but you are obviously NTA if he just joins you like that. He clearly panicked. It's just a very unlucky situation, I'd say, and try not to think about it further. Just next, you see that person you'll know", "Yeah, honestly I would do the same in the future. No perfectly healthy person who is afraid of dogs would get into a small elevator with one.

Anyway, no, you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA - he could have waited the extra minute if he's so scared of dogs.

A lady in a building that allowed pets was carrying her cat in a carrier when I went to get in. I mentioned the allergy quickly just to not confuse people why I wasn't getting on, she apologized, I said it wasn't a problem and I would wait and that was that.\n\nRule of thumb I use is whoever was there first has right of way.

It was terrifying and they were very lucky to not be more severely injured.)\n\nFor a long time, they were scare of all dogs but they are doing much, much better now.\n\nThey are still very wary of medium to large dogs, depending on the breed and still very scared of specific breeds of larger dogs, German Shepherds obviously, but also any others that appear to be more 'scary', in their eyes.\n\nFortunately, pitbulls and some of the other breeds of fighting dogs with an extremely bad reputation are banned in France - I'm not that well informed on the specific details of the laws because I've never needed to be, as a cat owner, to be honest!\n\nThey can interact carefully with a family friend's weimaraner now, for example, and just yesterday, while out fir a walk in the forest, we met some people walking a young, excitable dalmatian that they really wanted to meet (very positive!) but ultimately, they had to back off as it was just too excitable and it was too much for them to handle. \n\nEveryone stayed very polite, we said \"Bonjour\" to each other, the other people saw my kid pulling back so pulled their dog in response, instantly. \n\nThey, a young teen, took control of their fear, managed the level of interaction they could handle and when it became too much, they stepped away. \n\nIf we were approaching a lift with OP in it - well, my kid loves huskies, so they'd probably want to meet OP's dog!\n\nBut if OP had a GS, then it's first come, first served.\n\nWe'd either wait for the lift at a very comfortable distance, or, we'd take the stairs but only to go down!

You were there first, the idiot should have waited for the next elevator if he's afraid of dogs.", "NTA. He got into the elevator with YOU not the other way around", "NTA he not only got in the elevator without saying anything he decided to move into a pet friendly building knowing that crossing paths with pets was going to be a thing at times. Would it be nice of you to skip the elevator if he's already in it when you see him again, yes. Are you an ah if you don't, no.", "Nope you are NTA\n\nThe guy shouldn't have got on the elevator since you were already there.  Were you supposed to magically make your dog disappear, Get off at the next stop and wait for it to come back so you could get to your floor?  \n\nGuy needs to deal with his issues.", "NTA. He had the chance to not go in the elevator with you but still chose to.", "This has been posted before.", "NTA especially if he rushed into it and you where waiting. He was probably hoping you would leave if he \u201centered first.\u201d NTA.", "NTA\\~\n\nYou were waiting for the elevator before the guy even arrived.  HE choose to get into it.  It is not your issue that he did not pay attention to his surroundings and did not see your dog  (I mean a Husky is a sizable dog)", "I feel so sorry for people with dog trauma, I'm sure it's difficult to deal with. I once took my dog to a restaurant with outdoor seating on a date. We sat in a corner out of the way. My girl was just chilling, relaxing, and being the good, calm girl that she is. This woman dressed to the nines began freaking out. I didn't notice her reaction at first. You had to walk through the outdoor seating area that had iron fencing around it to get to the entrance of the restaurant. I may have made the mistake of sitting right at the entrance of the iron gate, I didn't think anything of it. So her man got fed up with her reaction and went ahead into the restaurant without her. She was pressed up against the wall, arms splayed, trying to slowly inch past us. She kept saying she's afraid of dogs over and over. It took about 10 minutes for her to get by us. I apologized to her but I didn't know what to do. My dog wasn't even acknowledging her. I still don't know what I should've done in that situation. \n\nNTA. Sometimes people have previous trauma and enter into situations without being fully aware of their triggers. You didn't do anything wrong and this person had a traumatic response they probably weren't prepared for. You can't realistically live your life accommodating for everyone. \n\nMy dog isn't even a \"scary\" breed. She's 60 lbs, brindle, and has no pit or any other breed like that in her. She looks like a brindle dalmatian.  Now I could 1000% understand if I had brought my 100 lb staffordsire bull terrier, he scares people pretty easily with his appearance.", "The arguement could be made for both, personally NTA because if you were indeed there first he could've waited.  Though dog phobias are real, and they're scary and can make up a big part of day as dogs are extremely common.", "NTA.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Some people just think that it's up to the rest of the world to adjust to them, as opposed to them adjusting to their circumstances.", "NTA. People are responsible for managing their phobias and triggers. A good way to manage this phobia would be to not rush into an elevator containing said phobia. Probably wise to not aggravate said phobia, as well.", "NTA\n\nHe knew about his own phobia he should have waited or taken the stairs. It was not on you to manage his shit.", "You were not in the wrong to stay on the elevator. I would say N.AH if he was just visibly frightened.  I could understand if he was in a rush and didn't notice the dog at first.  I could also understand if the dog made a motion towards him that scared him. I could understand freezing in fear and not being the person to exit the elevator first.   But repeatedly *yelling* \"Keep that dog away from me!\" is taking it too far.    I don't care how scared you are, *yelling* is clearly not a good solution for anyone, including the dog. Yelling is only going to make things worse.   NTA", "NTA.  You and your dog were already on there. He could have taken the next elevator.", "NTA\n\nYou were there first, you go in first. You can also let the person with phobia go in first if you want, but by your story, he didn't say anything about being too afraid to take the elevator with you and the dog.\n\nI hope he won't tell the neighbors some crazy version of the story, knowing how some pet-hating neighbors can be when they live in a building with people who have pets.", "NTa. He got in the elevator with you and the first time he said something I would have reminded him of that fact so he needs to stfu.", "NTA he is responsible for managing his phobias. He chose to get in a small elevator with a dog. It is what it is. Honestly, he was incredibly rude to you.", "Ngl if that was me and my dog and that man had tried talking to me my dog would have gone off. Strangers arent allowed to speak to me lol <3 \nTo clearify he only barks but he will bark for as long as you try to speak", "WTF is wrong with you.... why do you think you did something wrong? you literally did nothing. this post is like sentences.... \n\nCome on dude... are you bored? is that way you posted here??", "NTA. You were there first. And why on earth would someone yell when they are afraid of a dog? That would rile up many dogs.", "If dogs are allowed in your building (which I assume they are) then no, you don't have to get out because this guy is afraid of dogs.  If you have an aggressive dog, then perhaps I would have done it for everyone's sake, but if your dog is good and wasn't being bad, and you were waiting first, then no don't get off.  He didn't have to get on behind you once you had already gotten on first with your dog.  Perhaps he should have considered moving into a building where pets aren't allowed.  And you are much better than me.  I would have told him to shut up while we were on the elevator and he was yelling.  NTA.", "Done", "NTA. You were there first. At my complex, if someone doesn't want to be on the elevator with the pet, then they wait for the next one. They do not push past you and get on the elevator and expect you not to get on with your pet.", "NTA he shouldn't have gotten in the elevator if he is scared of dogs", "NTA\n\nI'm scared of dogs too, and would definitely not have been comfortable being in such an enclosed space with a dog. But that's my problem, not yours, and I would've just not gotten into the elevator with you and your dog. I'd either wait for the next one or take the stairs.  Him getting into the elevator, knowing there was a dog in there and that he'd have a problem with that, and then shouting at you for it was completely uncalled for", "INFO: Was the dog leashed?", "NTA. He should\u2019ve waited for the next elevator. Main character energy lol", "NTA -It's not you. It's him, and he should have waited if he didn't want to ride the elevator with another person and their dog.\n\nAnd NO, you didn't need to be polite. He needed to read the room, take pre-emptive measures and not ride the elevator with you if he has an issue with dogs generally, not get on the elevator with you when YOU were there FIRST, then yell at you about your dog.\n\nYou'll run into idiots like this all over the place.
