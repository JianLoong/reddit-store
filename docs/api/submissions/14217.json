You have graciously helped him by asking your FIL to go a bit out of his way.  In return, your friend has acted very disrespectfully. He is regularly late and makes you wait for him, causing you to be late twice.  That's unacceptable and disrespectful, especially when he stated he'd get up earlier to b ready on time.  \n\nHe never offered to pay for gas for your FIL.  On top of all of that, you offered one time to help him, and he assumed you'd always be his transportation.  He is taking advantage of your kindness.\n\nYou say that your friend offered to let you use his car, and he'd pay for gas.  Not the most reasonable compromise if you don't drive.  And if he has a car, why isn't he driving?  \n\nYou are not responsible for getting your friend to work on time.  He is an adult who needs to make arrangements for his own transportation.  Your job duties don't include providing transportation for others, and the secretary should not have come to his defense.

They will manage again.  This is their responsibility.**\n\n *he assumed that I am 100% open to picking him up every time.*\n\nThat's **manipulative, to assume that a one-time offer was now an everyday assumption.**  There's a thing some manipulative people do, where they just --expect-- at you.  And it's so easy to comply with that, because they aren't demanding or being rude.  It's that expectation that you will jump in and offer, or just comply with their wants.    \n\n *I am not sure if it is still possible to pick him up,* \n\nHis response to you telling him that you might stop, is to expect at you more strongly. \n\n *he said \u201cno problem, i\u2019ll wake up earlier.\u201d*\n\nHe made it sound like he would be thoughtful and make picking him easy for you. It was almost, but not quite, a promise to be considerate of what FIL was doing for him, and of your time.  But then **he didn't.  He made you late.  He made you wait.  And the reasons for this weren't reasonable ones.**  He wasn't late because he fell or had a really bad night of pain.  He wasn't late because he had a plumbing disaster and the plumber just left.  He was late because he didn't prioritize being ready on time.  **He was late because he wasn't considerate or gratefu**l for what you have done for him, and the inconvenience it is for your FIL and you, both.\n\n*I shared this to my husband, and he said that i sounded like an ass when I said it was not my responsibility, and could\u2019ve said it in a better manner.* \n\nCould you have said it better?  Maybe.  Did he have suggestions for how to say it better?  How many \"better\" ways did he come up with, on the spot?  \n\n**Truth is, this coworker** is capable of working and paying for rides, **has been taking advantage** of you for free, **hasn't offered to even pay** for gas once, **sees no problem with making you late for work and justifies his disregard with purely selfish nonsense**.  He's not a good friend to you, **he's using you.**  \n\nRead the book ***The Gift of Fear.***  Manipulative people can \"be nice\" while they manipulate and use others.  That you are seeing this and objecting to being used this way isn't wrong.  It's you talking the step back to see that you are being used and you are the one to make it stop.\n\n*Now i\u2019m overthinking this. AITA?*\n\nNTA.  ***All*** you have to say to him is **\"We won't be able to pick you up any more.\"  or \"Sorry, but we can't be your ride again.\"  Then don't discuss it.**  \"Excuse me, I've got things to do.\"  \"No, I don't want to discuss it.\"  It's a weekend.  Send the message via text, and let him find a ride for himself next week.  He's got time to do this.  Do not give reasons.  Do not explain or justify your decision to him.  You do not owe him reasons.  This is your decision, and it's between you and FIL, not this coworker.  All the coworker needs to know is the free rides just stopped, because **\"it doesn't work for us now.\"**  End of discussion.\n\nIf he tries to send people to humiliate you for stopping the rides, you can ask them when they are going to volunteer to give him free rides.  Or say \"I did what I could.  I can't continue to ask my *own* driver to do this anymore.\"  Or **\"It didn't work out.\"**  \n\nI use a cane if I have to walk much.  **You aren't in any way doing a disservice to the disabled by stopping the free rides to a rude and inconsiderate person.**  There are manipulative users in every category of people.  Manipulators, and emotional abusers,  love to try to make other people responsible for their responsibilities.  Own that word.  **You are right.**  You are not responsible for him, however much he's trying to make you feel responsible.  **His behavior has become an obstacle in your life.  You absolutely have a right to stop this before it gets worse for you.  Protecting yourself from a user isn't wrong.**", "NTA, he's making you late.
