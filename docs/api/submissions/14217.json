Since working in this office, my father in law is sweet enough to offer bring me to work as it gives him \u201cpurpose\u201d to wake up early, and do something. He only drops me off, leave, and go do his morning run, that\u2019s it. \n\nNow, my Friend is on crutches due to knee issues, and has been using ride-sharing apps like uber to get to and from work for many years now. \n\nOne time, I offered to pick him up because technically, it is on the way to work, but it consumes 10 more mins of travel to get to him. Once. But he assumed that I am 100% open to picking him up every time. \n\nInitially, I had no problems, because I had no specific time in/out at work until I officially sign the contract. Since I officially had one at 8am, I told my friend this, and that I am not sure if it is still possible to pick him up, and he said \u201cno problem, i\u2019ll wake up earlier.\u201d\n\nI have been late on my first week of work twice, because when I arrive at his place, he is still dressing up, and I had to wait for 10 mins. I told him about this, and he acted like nothing is wrong. So I tried the tactic where I tell him i\u2019ll pick him up earlier than my arrival time, but few minutes before I arrive he\u2019ll say \u201ci had the mistake of opening my email and asnwering some work messages, I forgot the time\u201d, and had to wait again. Also, he never gave me gas money for all this. Though he offered for me to use his car, and he\u2019ll put gas in it, which I refused.\n\nI talked to the office secretary/time-keeper, which has also become my friend and asked if she could move up my schedule to 7am. I told her about my problem, and initially, she tried to explain that my friend had mobility issues, and had trouble booking uber. I then said that I myself don\u2019t drive and I am feeling pretty guilty that my FIL is doing these extra things, and that it is not my responsibility to chauffeur friend to work. Secretary lives around our area as well, and she realized the logistics of our travel coul have gone better if i\u2019m not picking him up. So she agreed. \n\nI shared this to my husband, and he said that i sounded like an ass when I said it was not my responsibility, and could\u2019ve said it in a better manner.

If you're not ready to leave when we get there, we're going to leave without you. I can't risk my job because of your lateness.

He obviously abused your generosity and didn't think to take your schedule into consideration, so you don't have to take his Uber problem into consideration as well.", "NTA\n\nYou helped him once and then he expected you to do it everyday. The least he could have done is to respect your schedule and appreciate the help.\n\nBut I do think, that you could have handled the situation better and communicate with him better. I think it would be better to express a boundary much earlier to stop this from happening altogether.", "NTA. \n\nOld mate is saving money on Uber. He should give petrol at least.

She did it because we\u2019re friends. I still offered to pay for gas. I buy her dinner sometimes to repay her kindness of literally driving me somewhere.

As they say no good deed goes unpunished.

Although it would be better if you'd had a direct conversation with your friend instead of changing your roster to so much earlier. I have disabilities and take ubers a lot as part of my morning commute and while I sympathise with your friend because it can get expensive and is sometimes reliable, I think he definitely took advantage of your offer and was rude in making you late to work. If someone is giving me a ride I make sure I'm dressed and ready to go at least 15-20 min before they get here!", "YTA - You could have solved this situation by telling your friend that you won\u2019t be able to pick him up anymore.

What on earth is wrong with people (especially family) calling people arsewholes for being honest about inconveniences in their life that affect either their job, health, or family. Like if I can't go to my S/O without being judged or made to fell guilty about a situation that is literally no fault of mine and is causing problems at work, and they go \"well u sound like an AH\", I'll just keep things to myself and no longer discuss life problems with them. \n\nPeople need to wake up and learn how communicate better rather than pulling the \"you're an AH\" card.", "NTA - It is not your responsibility to chauffeur your friend to work.  Speaking a straightforward truth is not being an AH.

Your FIL has been kind enough to provide transportation for you.\n\nYour friend is responsible for getting himself to work on time.  You have graciously helped him by asking your FIL to go a bit out of his way.  In return, your friend has acted very disrespectfully. He is regularly late and makes you wait for him, causing you to be late twice.  That's unacceptable and disrespectful, especially when he stated he'd get up earlier to b ready on time.  \n\nHe never offered to pay for gas for your FIL.  On top of all of that, you offered one time to help him, and he assumed you'd always be his transportation.  He is taking advantage of your kindness.\n\nYou say that your friend offered to let you use his car, and he'd pay for gas.  Not the most reasonable compromise if you don't drive.  And if he has a car, why isn't he driving?  \n\nYou are not responsible for getting your friend to work on time.  He is an adult who needs to make arrangements for his own transportation.  Your job duties don't include providing transportation for others, and the secretary should not have come to his defense.  I'm glad she realized that this is putting an undue burden on you.", "NTA This coworker is taking advantage of you and making you late. You needed to put your foot down.", "NTA take care of yourself. Coworker was managing before, he can manage again.", "There's nothing in this post about how her FIL felt about giving the ride or whether or not she was giving him gas money or if he even wanted it (some families don't expect it). So I think your judgement is a little harsh here and maybe should have been INFO instead."]}
