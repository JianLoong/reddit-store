I tend to spoil them and my siblings\u2019 children but no one has ever had a problem with it before \n\nI\u2019m an executive at a company. This was hard work and dedication on my part (hence no children of my own who would have been neglected on this path) so I can provide the comforts of life to the fam. I was able to cash out my shares recently. In celebration, I bought courtside seats for myself and my nephews and niece (18M,14M,10F,8M) for their favorite NBA team.\n\nDay of the game I\u2019m picking up the younger two kids. My sister asks \u201cwhat section did you say you would be in so we can keep an eye out?\u201d I told her \u201cjust look for [player] and you\u2019ll see us.\u201d My BiL caught on super quickly and realized they were court side seats. He loses his mind and says he should go instead of one of this kids. I said you can go but you\u2019re not sitting with us and can buy your own tickets. Then he said the kids won\u2019t appreciate going the way he would. I said I wouldn\u2019t appreciate him going the way I would for them. My sister told him to shut up and pushed us out the door. \n\nHe followed us out and again asked one of the kids to switch spots with him. I said the kids are going that\u2019s final. He then said how about he goes in my place instead since I hate basketball (he\u2019s not wrong I\u2019m not a basketball fan) i said if it was just me and his kids I would switch but I have my brothers\u2019 kids too and I just want them all to have a night out, no parents. Also I love having adventures with them. My sister comes out and tells him to get inside. He leaves and so I thought that was the end of it. \n\nOn my way over to the stadium I get a call from my mom. She says my BiL called her complaining that I spent way too much money on the tickets. My mom is a highschool teacher at a title1 school in our city and so she\u2019s sensitive to overspending. I told her that my company (a lie) gave me the tickets and I just wanted to have an evening out with my niblings and create memories with them. She hangs up. We go to the game. Everyone has a blast. \n\nSince then my BiL keeps throwing jabs at me to my parents and sister. He\u2019s complaining to them that I\u2019m  going to just blow all my money away on BS and they need to talk to me about my spending. ESP if I\u2019m wasting it on children like that. I told him to get over himself and he had no problem with my spending any other time of the year for any other gift except for now. His response was this gift is unreasonable when I could have saved and spent it on my parents. \n\nSo AITA for taking kids to a game?", "created_utc": 1686490156, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146tzc2/aita_for_buying_courtside_tickets_for_kids/", "score": 152, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would just sit down with big fancy jealous butt and let him know how you want to spend your mad stacks and he can either get behind it or you won't take his kids. Hah. Nah not that.
