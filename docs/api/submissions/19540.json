He leaves and so I thought that was the end of it. \n\nOn my way over to the stadium I get a call from my mom. She says my BiL called her complaining that I spent way too much money on the tickets. My mom is a highschool teacher at a title1 school in our city and so she\u2019s sensitive to overspending.
