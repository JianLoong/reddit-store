I have the same thing from my mom.", "So in other words; your mother and sister are afraid of your father, so they want to send you into the lions den while you are recovering from surgery.

Not fighting other's battles.", "NTA, but your mom is in this story. She shouldn\u2019t be asking you to get in the middle of a conflict between your father and sister. If she believes your sister is being punished unfairly than she needs to take it up with your dad, not you. \nYour sister has access to a phone currently, if mom feels your sister doesn\u2019t like it for any reason than mom should be the one speaking up. \nI don\u2019t know why your dad didn\u2019t want her going on the date, but your sister went regardless and now she\u2019s suffering the consequences of her actions.

Your dad rounds like an AH, your mom and sister acted like AHs.", "NTA.\n\nIf your father is such a caution, it would be a mistake to test his patience in this matter.\n\nLet your mother and sister do the pleading with him. You don't owe them this.", "If she has another phone why does she need it? Nta", "Definitely NTA!!

Mom is going to have to learn, even if it takes therapy how to co-parent with your father without manipulating one of her kids to benefit the other. That type of behavior is just as abusive as dads intimidation tactic with his anger, the aftermath may not be the same initially, but over time it produces the same anxiety. And anxiety is not something that is easy to overcome when it is used to control a persons behaviors and/or actions, it can in fact produce a lifetime of limitations.", "NTA. The thing you learn from fishing is it never works out well for the bait.", "NTA- First rule of first aid is make sure it's safe to assist, and do not make yourself an additional casualty. It really doesn't sound safe for you to intervene and a 15 YO can do without her main phone for a few days.", "Nta. This is sister's problem. She might give a heartfelt apology and offer an alternative to the punishment.", "Your moms the asshole for putting you in the middle of it. She's using you to gang up on him. The man knows boys in a way you can't see. Your mother encourages you girls to disrespect your father regularly it seems.
