My father (42m) hasn't been in the picture for 2 years. Although, I do try to include him through messages and phone calls my mother does not know about; she doesn't want me to talk to him. My mother has a restraining order that states he is not allowed on the property of her work. The only place my father is allowed to pick me up for visitation is my school. So what does my mom do? Work for my school district. i will admit, my father got involved in bad decisions a few years back, but he has shown some serious improvement since then.\n\nMy mother and I don't have a very good relationship, nor do I plan to build a better one.\n\nI share a room with my stepsister, Jamie (13f), on the weekends because she lives at her grandma's during the week. I hate it. She burns my clothes at her grandma's if it looks nice on me, smacks me, says racist things like \"go bomb ukraine\" because I'm Russian, but God forbid if I defend myself, because then I'm a condescending bitch, right?\n\nThis is a reason I get therapy, but not the main reason. A month ago, my infant cousin passed away while I was in the room, and it has given me PTSD, depression, and anxiety.\n\nI also have gained weight since then.\n\nMy mother was making food for everyone, and when everyone was eating, I asked her if I could have some, she tossed me a diet salad packet and said, that if I didn't want that, then I could starve until dinner.\n\nA few weeks before that, I came back from therapy with my confidential papers. My mother demanded I tell her what I talked about. Given it is confidential, I don't have to tell her. She then got pissed at me, and proceeded to threaten to kick me out for keeping secrets because, \"my paycheck is confidential\", then snatched the folder and read through my papers. Worst part is, she lied to get everybody to side with her.\n\nI have told my counselor about this, and my father. I have been messaging him, planning to move with him, and he is planning family court within the next few months. I have not told my mother about this because I want it to hit her out of nowhere so she can't make up lies to get me to stay.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1691660966, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15n7vai/aita_for_not_telling_my_mother_im_planning_to/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Talk through your decision with your counsellor thoroughly. People don't get restraining orders for no reason. Be careful and perhaps it may be wiser to actually just report your mother.

Are you sure that dad will be able to get custody?  If he doesn't, your life will probably get a lot worse.  Document everything that happens like the salad incide.  If she doesn't have access to your devices,  email your notes to yourself so she doesn't find them.  Otherwise, find a good hiding place or have someone you trust keep copies.  Good luck.", "NTA.
