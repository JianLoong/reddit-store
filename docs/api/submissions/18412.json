It\u2019s funny how these posts never start with mentioning their undies were poopy, like that\u2019s NORMAL. \n\nthe slow realization that he had in the post that yeah, she was making sure he washed his poopy ass and not foreplay was palpable.", "Some straight men think that washing their bum will give them the gay. Because only gay men are interested in men\u2019s bottoms. \n\nIt\u2019s such silly logic, because I bet they wank a lot, and having a man\u2019s hand touch your willy is a lot gayer than washing your arsehole.", "I'm a free cheeker!
