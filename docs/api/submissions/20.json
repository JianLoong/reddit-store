Anytime i wanted to bring something home to have for myself, if it made it over the doorstep it was immediately community property and i usually never even got to enjoy it because my brothers would scarf it down before i even got a bite. So due to this, i have a (bad) habit of what is known in the animal kingdom as resource guarding. I'm very protective of my food. Don't touch it. Ask me for it and at least give me the opportunity to say yes or no. Plain and simple. \n\nI go to this local gym and we're a super tight knit group there. When i get off work I'll usually stop somewhere and get myself a small snack or something to have before or after my climb. A single mom brings her child to the gym (this is normal for people to bring their children to this gym) and everyone typically loves him but he's a little ill behaved. He has a really bad habit of going through my stuff. His mom has told him several times not to do it, and he'll stop then but the next time I'm at the gym he'll do it again. \n\nSo this time i brought some pretzel bites to the gym and was eating them before my climb. There must've been one left in the bag and he zoomed up while i was talking to his mom and reached into the bag and grabbed it just looking at it. I had enough and i fussed at him \"(child's name) stop touching my food. You didn't ask, you didn't even acknowledge me. You don't just run up and grab people's stuff especially without asking\". \n\nMom gives me the death stare and tells him to put it down and he goes  back off to play. She then tells me that i shouldn't have fussed at her child because he's just a kid and doesn't know any better. I told her my two year old knows to ask people for food and not to just run up and grab it. Unfortunately, this \"doesn't know any better\" attitude is a result of poor parenting since my 2 year old is better behaved than a 6 year old in this category. She told me i didn't need to be rude about I and just understand that she's trying. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667230473, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiff72/aita_for_fussing_at_a_6_year_old_for_touching_my/", "score": 2090, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like you have been patient and understanding with this kid's behaviour and simply stood up for yourself when it continued for too long. From what you said, it wasn't overly aggressive or stepping on the mother's toes. You have a right to maintain personal space for your body and belongings.\n\nI don't have kids but did work in a toy store for 5 years. I have seen many a tantrum and poor behaviour in my day and can respect that parents are often doing their best and kids are still learning. I don't see a kid having a bit of a breakdown or acting out as a definitive sign of poor parenting, and I understand that part of the learning process is socializing kids in public spaces. They're going to be disruptive sometimes and that's fine.\n\nThat said, it's the parents' responsibility to determine what their own children can handle and make sure they don't cause other people too much inconvenience or discomfort, especially in spaces that aren't specifically kid-friendly. Child starts fussing during a movie? Be respectful of every other paying customer and take them outside. \n\nI try to be respectful of different parenting styles but I draw the line on leaving people to deal with their own kids in their own time where staying quiet could allow harm to the child, myself, or someone else. If your kid is trying to light a cat on fire, just snagged my phone, or has started hitting another person, deal with it however you want after but I'm stopping that immediately. Rights as a parent do not override other people's rights or safety. \n\nYou didn't hurt the kid or threaten them.

I did like to play with my Cabbage Patch dolls, but in a VERY limited capacity, and was much more interested in climbing trees. I specifically thought Barbie Dolls were stupid. Except my mom's old Barbie from the 1960s, but I only played with her after I gave her a \"modern (read: mid-80s)\" haircut, and converted her \"mink stole\" into her pet worm, who helped her solve crimes. For my 7th or 8th birthday, my 3-days-younger cousin gave me a Malibu Barbie, complete with different fashionable bikinis and I don't know what the hell else. I instantly knew I would never once play with it, but I also knew that my cousin, the ostensible gifter, DID like Barbie Dolls, didn't have this one, and would love said Malibu Barbie. So with the best intentions in the world, I asked her if she wanted it, since I knew she'd like it and I wouldn't really play with it. She eagerly accepted, but my mom overheard and swooped down and HOO-BOY, did I get an earful about how inappropriate it was to tell someone you didn't like a gift; even if you despised it, the polite thing to do was graciously accept it and then find a better home for it without ever making the gifter feel bad or that they'd done something wrong. I never forgot that lesson, and have graciously accepted some truly stupid/horrific gifts since, some of which I have thrown directly in the trash after getting them, though the original givers are unaware of that (a kitchen clock with badly-painted grapevines along the circumference, on a plainly-visible styrofoam backing from my step-grandmother comes to mind).\n\nPoint is that, after I did something inappropriate, even though my motives were genuinely pure, my mom took the trouble to 1. LISTEN to my explanation (Laura would like it while I didn't really like Barbies), 2. Tell me WHY what I'd done was inappropriate (it's not polite to tell someone you don't like their gift, and also Laura's mom didn't have a lot of money, so to say I didn't like the gift she'd spent money on would make her and her mom feel bad), and 3. EXPLAIN to me what an APPROPRIATE action would have been--i.e. provide a template for me to navigate such situations in the future (thank the person graciously in the moment, and if I truly don't like the gift, privately re-home it with someone who will appreciate it, without the giver ever suspecting).\n\nThe little Gremlin who went through OP's things had none of these advantages, which is a failure of the mom, because even if he DIDN'T know better--just like I didn't--it is literally her job to TEACH him better.

That\u2019s literally what \u201csocializing\u201d your child *is.* They will learn how their behaviour impacts others when others respond to their behaviour - this includes animals, other children they play with, and adults. \n\nIf you tell your kid not to play in the poison ivy, and they damn do it anyway, are you going to get mad at the poison ivy, and tell it to \u2018knock it off\u2019 because can\u2019t it see you\u2019re just trying to be a parent? No! This is just how children learn the natural consequences of their behaviour. As parents, the best you can do to minimize the child\u2019s shock / upset is by warning them what the natural consequences of their actions will *be.* But you can\u2019t force them to listen. Sometimes kids just need to learn the hard way.\n\n**If you get insecure and take it as a personal attack on your parenting every time your child is corrected or redirected by another adult, you\u2019re going to put yourself through a lot of unnecessary anxiety.**\n\nIf a child didn\u2019t know any better (which, frankly, this one DID because he has been told multiple times before), that\u2019s a reason *not to be angry* with them for doing the thing in the first place. It\u2019s NOT a reason *not to correct or redirect* them from doing the thing once they\u2019ve done it. Otherwise, how on earth are they ever expected to *learn* any better?", "I feel like it depends on the behavior and the child's developmental stage. A toddler dropping a toy in a fish tank? There's no way a two year old who's not really speaking sentences yet is going to understand that can harm the fish and they aren't comprehend an explanation. At that point you redirect, say \"that's mean to our fish friends\" which isn't gonna fully sink in, and keep them away from the tank because they do not know better. If a 9 year old is dropping stuff in a fish tank they know better; they're old enough to get cause and effect and know that animals can be harmed. \n\nA six year old should know better than to take someone else's food without asking. I'd say they start grasping that in the late toddler-early kid range and by ~4 they should absolutely have that down pat.", "Hard agree. IMO, \"They don't know any better\" is only acceptable for behaviors that a child is not developmentally able to comprehend aren't acceptable. So like infants pulling hair/jewelry/glasses.", "Thanks for clarifying :)", "And the mom sat there and did nothing. And it wasn\u2019t even the first offense", "\u201cFeral McTiny\u201d\nThat is all.\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Somehow all I can think is that Tiny McFeral seems to be a more realistic name.\n\nIn my defense I have a massive headache\u2026", "I train at home so children are around sometimes.  But my children and their friends know not to get in the way from kettle bell swings.", "I love your style!!!!!  Dildos, lube, condoms, handcuffs, all of it!", "You're an evil genius!  I like you!", "Then you'd be the sex weirdo. Never going to live that down.\n\nA lot of high fiber food comes chocolate flavor.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I'm not sure this would achieve anything other than give you a weird reputation. Child isn't going to be embarrassed.", "All of this. As a parent whose child has been *that* kid in public many, many times - like, cops have been called to the grocery store parking lot over a coloring book I wouldn\u2019t buy - unless someone hit my kid, threatened, or said something inappropriate, I would be embarrassed to be defending her shitty behavior like that. It\u2019s embarrassing enough when someone else has to say something to your kid because they\u2019re out of pocket and not listening to you, but then to act like the person who was inconvenienced by having to parent your kid is the one in the wrong? I don\u2019t know how these people don\u2019t involuntarily crawl away into a sewer and die of embarrassment and shame.", "This is similar to a post where people were trying to argue that a 6 (?) year old who had been putting snails in the drinking water tank \u201cdidn\u2019t know it was bad because nobody said snails were poisonous\u201d - no, but she sure as hell knew they didn\u2019t belong in the drinking water.", "You're completely right. In my defence it was like midnight and I was on a very delayed train. Brain wasn't working.", "Whipped cream and chocolate syrup", "But the mother will be and that's the point. To make the mother to parent her child.", "YES!!!", "I bet he doesn't do it again. NTA", "NTA\n\nsome parents dont have the heart to properly educate their kids.\n\nhad a similar issue with a kid a few years ago, was at the park doing some juggling practice and this kid just took some of my props and run around with it. I told him to give it back nicely like twice and he didnt listen.. and the mom just doesnt care\n\nnow.. i have a rule, i only play nice twice, and not three times.. so i shout at him with all my lung capacity.. immediate crying ensues \ud83d\ude05\n\nhopefully that shock therapy can be good lesson to the kid..", "One need not defend oneself when one makes such amazing contributions to this world.\n\nBesides, I hear last names as first names are all the rage these days\u2026", "Aw, thank you."]}
