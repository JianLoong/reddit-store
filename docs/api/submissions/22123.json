I, 30f, was at the beach this morning with my 3 children. Where it was so early, the beach wasn't even remotely crowded (residents only place). There was maybe 5 or 6 other people there and the beach is huge. Well, almost as soon as we got there some guy with a dog on a leash comes walking in our direction and noticeably shifts so he is walking closer to us than the beach (which was a good 60 feet away from where we had our towels set out). When he got closer he dog started pulling and he did that thing that some dog owners do, where he pulled the leash just enough to not let him jump all over us but kept the dog close enough, just in case we wanted to pet his dog. He then mumbles some half assed \"sorry, he just loves pettings and kids\" and slows down to a crawl, waiting for us to reach out and pet his dog, which we didn't. Then the dog starts whining and trying to get closer and he let him. So at this point this dog is right in our faces and stepping all over our stuff. He then says \"you guys want to pet him?\" So I said \"no, get your dog away from us\". He then proceeds to scoff at me and say \"he only wanted attention\", pulls his dog off and starts shit talking us to the dog. \"It's okay baby, some people are just assholes, everyone else here will love you\". \n\nAfter this he proceeded to walk by several times and did the same thing to others who showed up at the beach. Some of them pet the dog and loved on him but others looked visibly uncomfortable. This is also a no dog beach but the dog had a vest on saying \"ESA\", so of course it can't be turned away at the front gate.

I would NEVER allow my dogs to approach someone unless the person/people were actively encouraging it. They could be allergic, phobic, or simply not like it. Nobody has the right to push their passion onto another person, whether that be an animal, hobby, religion, politics. I love punk music.
