I play online and also do time trials mode (at some point I even held a world record in mario kart 8). \n\nNow my ex boyfriend Ethan (21M) is an avid gamer, he has a ton of diferent consoles and plays almost every game gender you can think of. He gets very competitive in basically every game, even minecraft. I on the other hand, don't enjoy gaming that much, I only have my switch in which I play minecraft mario kart and short games I find on sale sometimes. I'm also not that competitive when I play with friends, I usually make sure to chose a bad combo or not take shortcuts to even things a bit and make the game fun for everyone. So before this past sunday whenever I played with Ethan and our friends I always downplayed myself a lot and everytime I lost a race he would scoff or say things like \"I don't understand why you cousins say you're a menace in this game\" or \"is this really you best babe?\". \n\nAt the start his comments didn't bother me because I know he gets like that with everyone in every game he plays but recently he started to include this type of comments when I was doing nothing related to gaming. For example when I'm driving he says he hoped I didn't drive in real life like I do in the game.\n \nLast sunday we were over my friend's Elle place, playing the game again and he finally managed to get under my skin. I was fed up so I asked for a moment to change my combo and started to play like I do when I play online, I won every race we played. Ethan, as expected made a scene, acussing me of cheating or having my joy-cons tricked somehow, he got to the point where he was screaming and flexing his fists real hard. I just told him something along the lines of \"I've been holding back when playing with you to not hurt you sensibilities, Ethan. And you gotta learn how to lose, specially when it comes to something as stupid as a videogame.\"\n\n After that he left without me even tho he was the one who gave me a ride to Elle's house, so not only was I feeling mortified because of the scene he made in front of all my friends but I also had to ask my mom to come pick me up. I guess this was the strand that broke the camel's back because I sent a text telling him we were fucking through that night. He's been calling me and texting me a lot since monday, asking for a chance to talk but I realized I really don't want to have anything to do with him anymore so I've been ignoring him.  However I can't help but feel I created an embarrasing situation for him and should apologize for it and for the shitty break up I delivered.", "created_utc": 1697685145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17b989p/aita_for_humiliating_my_boyfriend_over_a_mario/", "score": 326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And when he persisted, you showed him that he really doesn't have a reason to trash-talk.\n3. When he started trash-talking you in real life, I'm going to suppose you let him know that you didn't like him doing that and that it wasn't OK. That was his warning that he ignored. (If you didn't say a word before this, that is a mistake you made... but it doesn't excuse his behavior at your friend's home.) He was perfectly fine with insulting you in private, among friends, over the game, over life. You didn't insult. You showed him his superiority was only in his head. And he displayed his incredible toxicity and lack of anger management. That is who he is and has been. There's nothing for you to feel guilty about.\n4. You aren't interested in being with someone like him. You broke up over text and consider it a shitty way to exit a relationship. Generally, I'd agree with you. It's good to talk, listen, and then decide for yourself whether there's a relationship worth working on or not. But sometimes, people's actions are just deal-breakers. No discussion needed. You didn't yell at him the way he yelled at you. You didn't ghost him. You told him - and he knows - exactly why you are done with him. You know you don't want to be with him anymore. **So (1) You do not have to apologize for being clear and decisive and timely with telling him you are out of the relationship. (2) You don't need to apologize for not wanting to be with him anymore.

In my book, you wouldn't have done anything wrong even if you talked shit the entire time you kicked his ass in Mario Kart. \n\nThe way he responded to all this absolutely should solidify the reason you dumped him. You are 100% in the right here.", "NTA. Tell him to get good", "NTA. Don't feel guity. Your good!", "NTA, however if he keeps calling you I think you should give him a message saying how he shouldn't be making a scene after losing a videogame at his age, and that you are 100% over.", "NTA. Competitive people like him are so toxic and it\u2019s good that you got out early. Usually people like him can\u2019t control their temper when they lose a game and lash out smh.", "NTA, his insecurity is really pathetic. Don't take him back. Also, I had no idea people could even be competitive in minecraft.", "NTA you were trying to have fun and he was trying to feel \"better\" than you. Sounds like he really does need to learn how to lose since it seems he's a sore loser and sore winner. The fact he clenched his fists over you beating him in Mario Kart says volumes.", "NTA. RIP bozo. He\u2019s a fucking baby.", "NTA lol", "NTA - he's completely over reacted and been a dick there.\n\nThat said, as a general bit of advice, and it's hard to know from what you've written here, it feels like he knew you were holding back and that can be annoying- it comes across as condescending.  He's clearly communicated that really badly, but it might be part of what's behind the blow up.\n\nIf I'm playing someone a lot better than me at something I either want them to play their best so I can improve / learn, or if that's just undoable, I'd rather agree some formal handicap type system, but so they are still playing \"properly.\"\n\nYour point about picking a bad combination and agreeing no one uses short cuts is a great example. That's a way of evening up the game up so you still have to play well. \n\nMaybe you just needed to play at \"Full strength\" a few times with him in private to get over the \"you're deliberately going easy on me but won't admit it,\" hurdle and agree a way to play together.\n\n(Or that its just not possible, my wife and I had to stop playing a particular board game because we couldn't find a way to balance it which didn't rely on my just deliberately playing badly.)", "He was a sore winner talking all that shit. And he was a sore loser when he realized you\u2019ve actually been pretty graceful around him. He also left you in front of your friends. What an abysmal excuse of a boy. NTA.", "NTA. You didn't embarass him, he embarrassed himself, and he had it coming. Nothing is more irritating than a competetive cocky person who gets worked up over things that litterally don't matter at all. Maybe this will be a lesson for him. He's too old to be throwing tantrums like a toddler.", "I can't imagine anything more unattractive than an adult gloating about a video game to their partner and then throwing a tantrum in front of my friends when they lost. Add on top that they left you without a ride and it would be an easy decision to break up. I'm not sure you could be attracted to someone like that ever again.", "NTA\n\nOoh, Ooh, my pride and ego\u2026", "NTA\n\nHe caused that much of a scene over a game? toxic masculinity coded. I\u2019m glad you managed to get out because these red flags over something minor can escalate into something more detrimental especially if he blew up like that about you winning a game \nWhat about rainbow road? If you boss this race then you have even more of my respect lol", "NTA - your ex is both a sore winner and sore loser. he played stupid games and won a stupid prize. good on you for serving up the lesson", "Nta. The ex needed an ego check and you gave him one. The ex needs anger management and less screen time.", "NTA - you'd been losing on purpose because you knew he was going to be a big baby about losing. But he was also being a jerk about winning. The guy needs to learn how to do both without being an AH.\n\nLet this be a lesson to you on not dimming your shine for anyone. You deserve to be with someone who wants to cherish all of your strengths.", "Welcome to the world of gaslighting! NTA, he just is a boy baby who needs a few knockdowns to grow up", "NTA, if you\u2019re gonna want a career for yourself and not be a SAHM then you\u2019ll have to make sure your career makes less than Ethan\u2019s because if he can\u2019t handle 2nd place in a game he won\u2019t handle it in life.", "NTA. He\u2019s acting like a child. Games do NOT equal real life.", "NTA for sure, that being said my Grandpa used to say this thing, bear in mind I don't remember ever beating this man at pool or bowling, but I love both of those games more because he never let me win or held back. No offense, but your boyfriend sounds like he ITA that also being said, he is probably just embarrassed.", "Def NTA\n\nIf your partner can't handle having a light shown on their own shortcomings, they aren't worth it. The pattern of belittling speech is even worse. Glad you got out of there when you did.", "NTA. \n\nHe embarrassed himself. You did nothing wrong.", "Can you come over and beat the time trials for me? I'd love the gold wheels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways NTA.", "NTA, don't trashtalk when you can't handle being trash talked.\nMore seriously, he seems to have a lot of red flags.\nIgnore him, letting him get out of your life is the best decision for you now.", "NTA. \n\nHe humiliated you, you humiliated him.\n\nHis reaction, turning from competitive to full ape-shit, is definitely something, where you made the right call to end things. \n\nThat being said, take some time, and then, if you\u2019re ready and want to, have a conversation with him about what happened. If not, that\u2019s also fine.\nBoth ways don\u2019t mean, that you\u2019re getting back together. But talking maybe helps in the long run, for you, maybe even him, to understand his mistakes and grow.", "If your \u201cboyfriend\u201d got hurt over you winning a video game and then proceeded to ball his fist at you while screaming over you winning- that\u2019s your sign to leave. Especially because he\u2019d make comments in the beginning that\u2019s very disrespectful. You deserve better.", "NTA, he sounds like a dick, he is supposed to be an adult.", "NTA. I used to be pretty good at Mario Kart when i played it and i can confirm, When it comes to Mario Kart, Show no mercy. He\u2019s just a loser lmao", "NTA. You\u2019re the Hashirama of Mario Kart, you were gentle enough till he had to taste your power.", "Nta he's a sore loser, and probably a worse winner.", "NTA you dodged a bullet. Never make yourself less  than for a man\u2019s fragile ego! If they can\u2019t stand how great you are, get someone who can. The men who need their egos protected are not worth it!", "Talk about a rage quit", "NTA - he asked you to play your best. You don\u2019t need a weak ass man like that in your life. In Mario Kart - mercy is for the weak, my daughter kicks my arse every time we play it.", "NTA, he was the one who chose to act like a child and that's not on you", "I dated someone like this when I was your age, but instead of Mario Kart, it was about Tetris. I guess he just assumed that he would be better than me because he was a gamer and actively played many games, whereas I only really ever played Tetris from time to time. The reality was that I beat him in every match, and it slowly wore on him. He could not understand or accept that my score was better than his.  He did not flip out, but I was able to pick up on his frustration very easily, and it made him so less attractive in my eyes.  I\u2019m not going to stifle myself to make someone else feel better.  Also, it\u2019s damn game. \n\nNTA. You dodged a bullet.", "My gf and I have gotten into screaming matches before over Mario kart\n\nIf you can\u2019t game and be competitive devils then laugh ab it\n\nIs it really a relationship", "YES!!  Let him go if he can\u2019t handle the heat. My husband and I have been playing videos games together for 20+ years. We are both insanely competitive but we have fun with it. He is currently killing me at Tetris (which is MY F*CKING JAM!) but I still congratulate him and also I WILL REIGN AGAIN.", "I agree to both no mercy in mariokart and yeah he was basically a total jerk", "I agree to both no mercy in mariokart and yeah he was basically a total jerk", "I never hold back in video games, even with my neices and nephews. How the fuck do you learn and get better if I'm letting you win? Screw that noise. Step up or get stepped on", "Nawh guys like this are dicks to EVERYONE\u2026\u2026Not just women lolz. I grew up with gamers like this. I knew a dude who bragged about being good at MK so I faced him and beat him. He got angry and stormed out. It\u2019s not because she\u2019s a women\u2026.", "This sounds like excellent training for my daughter.

That said, I do understand downplaying yourself. There was a point in my life where my housemate got a proper foosball table for the house and for about two years we played/practiced every day and got very good at it, to the point that if we played together in random bars like we did at home we'd beat most teams by 5-0 in short order and no one would have any fun with the games, not even us. We fixed that by not allowing ourselves to do most of the plays we knew by heart and were very good at, making it a bit of a challenge for us and giving others a chance to win and enjoy the game.", "She nta he dose need to learn how to loose", "I don't think OP has been purposefully losing so much as she doesn't pull out her fully competitive play when she's not engaging in a real competition. For some ppl, when they play with friends or family, they don't care about winning so much as having fun with everyone. And OP realizes it wouldn't be fun for others to play with her if she won every single time. So she doesn't use everything in her arsenal and instead plays at their same level, not to be condescending, but to actually enjoy the game with everyone. At no point does OP say she does it to make them feel better about their skills. \n\nI mean, literally the first or second paragraph, OP says she's not competitive when playing with friends and wants them to have fun like she is too. Which makes sense, bc yeah, some ppl are competitive and would feel the drive to keep going and try to beat a player who was much better than them. But for anyone who's playing just for fun, it *would* get boring to keep playing when you always know the outcome.", "How she manipulative he got under her skin that's why she was no longer holding back that ain't manipulative", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I have no problem losing, but if someone has let me win for a long time and eventually revealed they are really good at x game it would be upsetting. It is being deceitful/lying. I think this is a bit worse because OP had a reputation for being great at Mario Kart. To provide a slightly exaggerated example, it would be like if I faced off with Tom Brady or Michael Jordan and I beat them only sometime/years later find out that they let me win. Obviously I know it is not a great example because a person would have to be delusional to think they beat TB or MJ, but the point being that if you beat someone that has a reputation for being good at something you can feel proud/excited to have that  wiped away would be disappointing. \n\nBF sucks more for how much he gloated about being \"better\" at Mario Kart than OP, and for his extreme reaction to learning she was letting him win.\n\nBut I don't think OP should purposely lose to others. It is one thing to not go all out and make it fun, but still win, it is another thing to actually throw the game/race entirely, OP should stop doing that.", "You guys should try out Tetris Attack.

Should she have held back true ability? No. Are young women brought up being told to be polite and to not brag or boast or do anything that might put men off? Fragile egos and all that? Maybe my generation but I still see it continue with some younger women. It was a dumb thing to do for sure. My issue is with his reaction, he was so quick to talk trash but when schooled he crumples and throws a tantrum? That conversation should have went something like this \u201cNo f*ucking way! You were holding out on me, damn I feel like an ass!\u201d Etc.\n\n\u201cSorry babe, didn\u2019t want to hurt your feelings\u201d\n\nThen he feels pride that his girl can kick butt at Mario kart and feels a bit of a fool too.\n\nThis is the kind of guy that won\u2019t be able to be supportive if she does better than him in life.
