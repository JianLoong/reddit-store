I play online and also do time trials mode (at some point I even held a world record in mario kart 8). \n\nNow my ex boyfriend Ethan (21M) is an avid gamer, he has a ton of diferent consoles and plays almost every game gender you can think of. He gets very competitive in basically every game, even minecraft. I on the other hand, don't enjoy gaming that much, I only have my switch in which I play minecraft mario kart and short games I find on sale sometimes. I'm also not that competitive when I play with friends, I usually make sure to chose a bad combo or not take shortcuts to even things a bit and make the game fun for everyone. So before this past sunday whenever I played with Ethan and our friends I always downplayed myself a lot and everytime I lost a race he would scoff or say things like \"I don't understand why you cousins say you're a menace in this game\" or \"is this really you best babe?\". \n\nAt the start his comments didn't bother me because I know he gets like that with everyone in every game he plays but recently he started to include this type of comments when I was doing nothing related to gaming. For example when I'm driving he says he hoped I didn't drive in real life like I do in the game.\n \nLast sunday we were over my friend's Elle place, playing the game again and he finally managed to get under my skin. I was fed up so I asked for a moment to change my combo and started to play like I do when I play online, I won every race we played. Ethan, as expected made a scene, acussing me of cheating or having my joy-cons tricked somehow, he got to the point where he was screaming and flexing his fists real hard. I just told him something along the lines of \"I've been holding back when playing with you to not hurt you sensibilities, Ethan. And you gotta learn how to lose, specially when it comes to something as stupid as a videogame.\"\n\n After that he left without me even tho he was the one who gave me a ride to Elle's house, so not only was I feeling mortified because of the scene he made in front of all my friends but I also had to ask my mom to come pick me up. I guess this was the strand that broke the camel's back because I sent a text telling him we were fucking through that night. He's been calling me and texting me a lot since monday, asking for a chance to talk but I realized I really don't want to have anything to do with him anymore so I've been ignoring him.  However I can't help but feel I created an embarrasing situation for him and should apologize for it and for the shitty break up I delivered.", "created_utc": 1697685145, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17b989p/aita_for_humiliating_my_boyfriend_over_a_mario/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you were afraid of beating him because he would respond poorly, why the hell did you let things continue for so long? It seems like you would have learned that he was too immature for a relationship with you if you had demonstrated your skills earlier.\n\nStop pretending to be bad at things to make your partner feel superior. It's a super toxic thing to do, because you're either trying to make yourself look less competent for their approval/to avoid a tantrum or you're acting in a condescending manner towards them when they'd be able to handle you being better like a normal person.\n\nFind someone who regards you as an equal, and make sure you view *yourself* as an equal as well.", "NTA!

When it was just during the games, you considered it annoying but minor.\n2. When it spilled over into him insulting you in your daily lives, you were not willing to accept it. And when he persisted, you showed him that he really doesn't have a reason to trash-talk.\n3. When he started trash-talking you in real life, I'm going to suppose you let him know that you didn't like him doing that and that it wasn't OK. That was his warning that he ignored. (If you didn't say a word before this, that is a mistake you made... but it doesn't excuse his behavior at your friend's home.) He was perfectly fine with insulting you in private, among friends, over the game, over life. You didn't insult. You showed him his superiority was only in his head. And he displayed his incredible toxicity and lack of anger management. That is who he is and has been. There's nothing for you to feel guilty about.\n4. You aren't interested in being with someone like him. You broke up over text and consider it a shitty way to exit a relationship. Generally, I'd agree with you. It's good to talk, listen, and then decide for yourself whether there's a relationship worth working on or not. But sometimes, people's actions are just deal-breakers. No discussion needed. You didn't yell at him the way he yelled at you. You didn't ghost him. You told him - and he knows - exactly why you are done with him. You know you don't want to be with him anymore. **So (1) You do not have to apologize for being clear and decisive and timely with telling him you are out of the relationship. (2) You don't need to apologize for not wanting to be with him anymore. (3) You don't need to give him a chance to convince you that you should give dating him another chance.**", "Nta, nah you got nothin to worry about, he embarrassed himself.
