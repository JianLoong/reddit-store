When I came back,  it was still there. I took it inside, called Amazon customer service. After being asked for and giving the associate the name, tracking number and contents of said package, I was told their policy was to either keep it or trash it. I kept a part of it, threw the rest away.\n\nLast night, the owner of the package knocked on my door loudly. I answered it and she immediately accused me of stealing her stuff. I apologized and asked what was talking about (I had completely forgotten about it at this point) she mentioned that she had a camera in her car and it recorded Amazon dropping off the item (plus they take photos of the home number) and she was contemplating getting the police involved. I remembered the items and asked about the specific one. She confirmed it was hers, then went into a story about Amazon not replacing the items or refunding her money and I apologized again and explained the situation, my actions and what I was told by Amazon. And since I still had one part of her package, I gave it to her, she left after repeating her concerns/assumptions about our thievery.\n\nToday (literally 30 minutes ago) I learned that she previously took her complaints to the only neighbor that I know and am friendly with in the complex. Bothering him at his job for over 10 minutes, calling my family thieves and threatening police action. \n\nSo, AITA for keeping (and trashing) someone else\u2019s property?\n\nETA: The individual unit/apartment number was not on the package. Just her name and the townhouse/condo/complex address itself. There\u2019s no manager office, no lobby, no communal area, no communal mailbox. It\u2019s a townhouse/condo type situation.\n\nI also didn\u2019t know her before last night.

I know about privacy policies and procedures, this is called \"wrong delivery\". Amazon (or any other similar company) will never pick up a wrongly delivered package, they prefer to refund the order, that's why they said that you could keep it or trash it. The customer who placed the order can be informed about the issue and the refund, but he/she should never be informed about the recipient's name or address. The customer was refunded immediately after your call (that's why they ask for the label details). It's clear that somebody made a mistake at some point and put you in this awful situation. I don't believe the camara recording story because it make no sense and she lied about the missing refund too (too much to explain, I don't want to give more details in here because it's also about financial agreements and it would be very unprofessional). It can be translated in a good money for you if you can find the way to document the interaction you had with the customer. In that case, ask to a lawyer if you can initiate a legal process in the state you're living in and if it's worthy. You're not a thief and the best thing to do when somebody comes to your house and accuses you is calling the police...you already have all her data. Any other opinion is based on complete ignorance about how business, policies and laws, because in many countries you're committing a violation if you try to deliver the package yourself to the person named in the label or if you try to contact them in any way. Last point: before the unfortunate encounter you had no idea she was your neighbor because it's your same address, just different number, unspecified.

Considering you live in an apartment building, I would\u2019ve just taken it down to the front desk, main lobby, etc, or placed it on the front steps downstairs with a note attached, if it\u2019s one of those types of buildings. Amazon did give you horrible advice, as well, telling you to keep or trash it\u2014which you did, you kept it. \n\nThat lady was a way bigger asshole.

NTA you called Amazon. You tried. You even left it there for while you shopped. Leaving it out starts to make it look like you aren\u2019t home. Which could cause a separate issue.

It\u2019s up to them to fix it not you. I had this same situation happen last week and Amazon told me the same thing, either keep it or trash it.

I have never had an issue with getting a refund or replacement from Amazon.", "NTA-\n1. There was no \u201ccommunal area or leasing office\u201d to put it in per OP\n2. You called Amazon \n3.

It is a federal offence to open someone else's mail. I live in a house that obviously has had multiple previous tenants and the two times a package showed up for one of them it wasn't that hard to find them and let them know I got their mail so they could come pick it up. Likewise people who moved into an apartment I used to live were aware enough to bring inside my package for a couple days while I realized the error and left a note in their mailbox about it. No it's not your responsibility but there is no reason to be a trash neighbor and a trash person. Was the proper name and address not on the package? This is a clear golden rule type situation.", "YTA. Why didn't you ask around to see if anyone knew this person? Packages get dropped off at the wrong house all of the time in my community.
