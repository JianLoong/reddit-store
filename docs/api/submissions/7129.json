I think this is something that most people would expect you to tolerate. They would agree he was wrong but in the end, it is just cake.\n\nExcept it isn't. This was a person who put in extra effort, (you are willing to order your own and he argued heavily against that) to make sure he says, \"fuck you\" every birthday. \n\nHe is not ordering cake because he likes it. He is ordering it because you don't. There are lots of ways for him to give you your cake and have a flavor he likes for himself. (I like controversial flavors so we do little Bundt cakes each year.) He could take a pass on cake for one day and eat chocolate cake any other day of the year.\n\nHe is deliberately doing it to you on a day you would like to feel special. I don't know his motivations but it sure isn't love and seems a lot of effort for just selfishness.", "NTA Honestly it sounds like he wants you to performatively not have dessert in front of his friends which is gross", "Oh he listened, he just ignored what he heard.\n\nIf I were OP I'd be making it quite clear that *he* humiliated *himself* in front of their friends and the resteraunt by getting this wrong *again*. I think at some point OP would have to stone-cold stare him in the eye while spitting on it and slowly scraping it into a trash can to be accused of being responsible for any part of the humiliation here.", "I can\u2019t get over the audacity of getting it wrong every year AND sulking that she doesn\u2019t trust him to get it right.", "I don't really understand. I like chocolate cake. My boyfriend prefers less sweet cakes. I heard him mentioned he loved tres leches, so a few months later I got him tres leches for his birthday. He was over the moon! And like, isn't that what you want to give your partner on their birthday? That feeling? I don't get it", "Though if you do the last part just get divorced instead.
