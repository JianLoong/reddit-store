It's YOUR birthday FFS.", "NTA. Your husband needs to learn to be more considerate. It\u2019s your birthday, you shouldn\u2019t be worried about the flavor of the cake. It makes no sense that he could mess up such a simple task.

My sister doesn\u2019t like cake at all.  So she usually gets pie on her birthday.  Since they can\u2019t get the cake flavor right (or refuse to) perhaps that would be easier for you.\n\nEDIT:  People are assholes though.  My mother will make a cake anyway and say that my sister is lying to be difficult.  She likes bread, muffins, brownies, cookies, doughnuts.  How can she not like cake?  Maybe.  I don\u2019t care.  If she wants pie, get her a pie.  Its her birthday, her choice.  And why would she have to hate cake to have pie?  What\u2019s it matter to you?

He's claiming you embarrassed him when he's very much embarrassed himself.", "NTA, but yes you did embarrass him, but only as a natural response for him giving you a cake you don\u2019t like.
