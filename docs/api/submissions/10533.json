My friend Ollie and his wife Rebecca have a daughter, Beth (4). Ollie and I have been friends for ten years, he's been with Rebecca for six. Rebecca and I have never had any issues, but I wouldn't say I know her very well. \n\nMy husband and I settled abroad full time last year as Maddie started school. I hadn't seen Ollie in a while, so I invited him and his family to visit us for a week. \n\nI absolutely adore Maddie, and being her mother is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. That said, the meta experience of \"motherhood\" is something I just don't identify with. When I'm in social situations, I talk about Maddie when it's topical, but I don't talk about what it's like \"to be a mother\", I don't talk about parenting, or kids. Conversely, this is the only thing Rebecca talks about. If she's not trying to gather a consensus on parenting, she's pre-packing snacks a day in advance even though anywhere we're going is ten metres from a cafe. It can be very tiring, especially as most of the time these conversations are directed solely at me, and she can be very judgemental if I try to shut the conversation down.\n\nSo, five days into the visit we all decided to go in the hot tub after the kids went to bed. My husband was fetching drinks so when I went out to the hot tub only Rebecca and Ollie were there. Ollie asked if the swimsuit was my design (I design some of my own clothes as a hobby) and I said yes, and Rebecca commented that it was \"a bit risqu\u00e9 for a mum\". At this point, I was just so tired of hearing the word come out of her mouth. I said, \"what exactly does that mean? Do you realise being a mother isn't a personality?\". Rebecca started tearing up and Ollie was trying to calm her down. Eventually, she got out and went upstairs, and Ollie thought it was best to give her some space. He said it was a harsh thing to say considering how Rebecca throws herself into parenting, but I made the point that since I've had a kid, he doesn't treat me any differently so why is it fair that his wife does. He said it's just different because I'm not a \"mum-ish\" type mother while Rebecca is so it basically is her whole personality. The next day, I did say I was sorry if I'd upset her, and Rebecca said it was fine and she was just tired, but it was awkward the rest of the trip. \n\nI've spoken to other friends about this and most say I was cold to say that to Rebecca because obviously being a mother is her entire identity and I basically told her it wasn't allowed to be. I understand where they're coming from but didn't she basically tell me it had to be mine, also? People also say Rebecca's way of being is completely normal and I don't understand because all my friends are either men or don't have kids. I don't think I'm wrong for what I said, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm not the AH, so, am I?", "created_utc": 1676978818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11818sk/aita_for_telling_someone_being_a_mother_is_not_a/", "score": 266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I see it much more often with the women in the couples I'm friends with that the *only* thing they talk about is their kids and being a parent. It's soooooooo fucking boring.

Rebecca wasn't just judgemental about your swimsuit, she'd been judgemental about not being as good a Mum as she was all holiday. Every chat about parenting and judgemental if you try and show interest in anything else.\n\nYour comment was that you think there is more to life than being a parent. And weirdly so does Rebecca, she only hyperfocused on you, the mother. Is she from a strict culture or religion because she has internalised fact that once a mother, you cease to exist as a person. And that was a good reality check for her. People have different beliefs. (edit to say: the men are also AHs as implying your need to be more than a mother conditioned because talking mainly to men and childless women.

It would be great if both of you realized that there are different ways to be a parent & other people don\u2019t have to do it the same way you do. It\u2019s fine if Rebecca wants to pack snacks that suit her & her kids rather than spending the time & money to buy things from cafes. In the instant case at the hot tub, Rebecca said something minorly rude, & instead of rolling your eyes, you got out the big guns & blasted her entire life. That was way out of line. Your so called apology was another AH thing to say. An apology is, \u201cI am sorry I said or did\u201d whatever it was. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had a bad reaction\u201d just absolves you & puts the blame on her. Rebecca was gracious enough to accept it. You should try being gracious, too.", "Rebecca's way of being isn't normal. What's she going to do when Ollie is 18 and she has to actually get her own life?\n\nESH   She started it with the negging on \"how a mother should be\" which is what you should have taken issue with (there is no way for a mother to be, risque or not) and you shouldn't have said what you did.", "YTA. You said something hurtful on purpose, from a place of anger. Textbook asshole move.", "ESH. \n\nDid you ever stop to think the reason she packs snacks is because they can't afford to go to every cafe? \n\nI think she's jealous of you and wishes she had your freedom, your carefree attitude, your financial situation, and your free time/hot bod. \n\nThe comment, isn't that too risque wasn't directed at your momhood as the comment suggests, she was getting at the bathing suit is a bit too sexual to wear around her husband. My money is on the fact she's jealous of your relationship with her husband. She probably thinks he loves how you're not bogged down in momhood. \n\nA lot of women struggle to find their identity after becoming a mum. Stop ripping them down. Instead of being all nasty, you could have said, hey you should try wearing a sexy bathing suit too. It's empowering. You'd look fabulous in a piece like this, you should try something like it or I know the perfect suit you can try.", "ESH. I don\u2019t agree with taking away someone\u2019s before personality, you should be able to wear what you like when appropriate and not be judged because you are a \u201cmom\u201d so Rebecca sucks for that. However, some people honestly just are \u201cmoms\u201d she\u2019s probably the one who collected all her drunk friends things and got them home when they were younger, she played with dolls and pretended they were her babies, I would disagree that mom isn\u2019t a personality, I definitely know some moms and I know some dads too.

Honestly, Rebecca sounds like an anxious parent. Like she feels like she has to do all of these things to live up to the expectation of being a SuperMum. She didn\u2019t come across as being a know it all kind of parent or anything like that, to me it came across like she has a lot of insecurities about being a mum and it\u2019s something she works hard at, maybe harder than you realise, and you\u2019re telling her she\u2019s gone overboard with it and it\u2019s too much and she hasn\u2019t taken that well. \n\nIt sounds like she even was happy to have another mum to share that burden of parental responsibility with I guess?

There are absolutely those women who turn bring a mother into the own personality they have. My sister is one of them. It is her sole topic of conversation and she manages to drive every conversation back round to her children. It is irritating as F.\n\nAlso this talk of \"too risqu\u00e9 for mother\" is absurd.

What is it about being a mother that makes this swimsuit inappropriate?\"", "ESH, she shouldn\u2019t have commented on your bathing suit but your comment was unnecessary and rude.

Yes", "NTA at all you have a valid point I wish a lot of mothers would realise.

She\u2019s conformed to the stereotype whether by choice or by pressure and you should show a little more dignity in your responses. She\u2019s entitled to have her mum personality just as much as you\u2019re entitled to have your more well-rounded personality.

Rebecca, for the bullshit risque for a mum comment, wtf. But you could have called her out on that without attacking her so broadly, that was uncalled for.

You should be thankful.\u201d Uh yeah, I\u2019m thankful but I\u2019m also frustrated and one doesn\u2019t negate the other. Society tells women that becoming a Mother is necessary to \u201cbe a real woman,\u201d and then judges us when everything we do isn\u2019t for our kids. It is really hard when your kids are young, especially if you\u2019re a stay at home parent, to have anything else to talk about cause in the early years you aren\u2019t doing much else. Women are heavily judged in motherhood no matter what choices they make and I imagine this woman has just lost herself to being \u201cBeth\u2019s mom.\u201d Society at whole treats with women children like incubators instead of people when pregnant and then once the baby arrives and after we recover tells us we can\u2019t wear the same clothes anymore cause \u201cyou are a mom now.\u201d She might be jealous but she might also be facing these sorts of comments from people around her and that\u2019s hard to deal with especially as a first time parent.

So I'm going with YTA for escalating the situation. OP, if you think you're superior to somebody at least act like it.", "I had a subordinate at work that ONLY talked about her two girls. It was definitely exhausting. But I knew to keep my mouth shut. Her kids are what made her happy so who am I to really judge her for that?", "It was something that came to mind, I guess random if there's no context to the story. She was cutting up crudit\u00e9s and asked if I wanted to do it with her and I said no because I'm not a snack planner, and she insisted that I do it otherwise she was going to have to feed both kids (absolutely not the case, if my daughter is hungry I will get her something, I would *never* expect anyone to give her anything), or that Beth would get upset if Maddie ate something different. When that didn't work she tried to have a whole conversation about why I don't have weekly meal plans. All that over carrot sticks and a dip.

If you try to shame someone for doing things differently than you they\u2019re allowed to clap back and defend themselves. Rebecca can define herself and motherhood however she wants she just needs to learn when to keep it to herself.", "This is the correct reply. Op also says she doesn't know this lady well- it could be that motherhood is the only thing she feels she has in common with op and that's her way of trying to bridge the gap. Op says Rebecca is judgemental, but she's the one who's mad Rebecca is packing snacks. (I pack snacks for my guy anytime we go anywhere in case the closer by restaurants are busy or the plan changes, because I like to be prepared, and I don't like hangry toddler screams.) Rebecca had no business commenting on how risque the suit was, but OP basically told her she had no personality.

Rebecca is likely feeling mom pressure to perform and sees that her husband likes OP's non-mom attitude and sexy bathing suit. And that makes her feel insecure. She shouldn't judge OP's choices and OP shouldn't judge hers, but it seems like OP is one of those women who isn't interested in building friendships with women. And it might rub Rebecca the wrong way.", "She was being boring and judgemental", "She was shaming OP. Rebecca made little digs at OP on how she isn\u2019t mom 100% and still wants her individuality and that her parenting style is not \u201ctv perfection mom\u201d where all she should focus on is being a mom and minding the kids and home. That\u2019s not right.

Your assessment was spot on- women like this use motherhood as a form of one-upmanship. They\u2019re usually insecure (and yes, boring and basic) and project that onto other women in an attempt to feel superior. Child-rearing and housekeeping are their favourite things to bitch about (and she will).

It\u2019s just passive aggressive digs all the way with women like that- you did right in shutting her down, haha! \n\nWhat a cheek, when she was benefiting from your generous hospitality.\n\nETA: Definitely NTA", "That's true.\nBut in this particular interaction, Rebecca was the one who initiated it by shaming OP to make herself appear better. It happens, people can be like that sometimes even without bad intentions.", "OP was defending herself not attacking. Unless there is something left out of the story then OP is most definitely not TA and Rebecca is.", "OP's reply wasn't based on the one comment, it was based on a week of interaction in which she felt judged. I don't think the snacks example was brought up to condemn packing snacks, but as something that illustrated the differences between their parenting styles. I've met a lot of people who think that if you're not doing things how they do, it's not a difference in style but you're actually wrong, and it's a very frustrating experience.", "Not really. She was being slut shamed in her own home by the guest she had graciously hosted.", "Yes but that's not what you said.

Just because she said something judgmental and rude doesn't mean you're justified in doing the same.", "You say you don\u2019t know her well, though. Is being a mother the only thing she knowingly has in common with you? If so it\u2019s not her \u201cexpecting every other woman in [her] vicinity to be passionate about it\u201d, it\u2019s just her trying to connect with you over one of the only things she knows you two have in common.", "Let\u2019s henceforth refer to the kid as Ollie Jr. A.k.a., OJ.", "People are allowed to be rude regardless. But it's childish to do tit for tat. Sadly this sub is all about the binary world view.", "I mean, defending herself is, \"I don't appreciate you speaking about my swimsuit; it's not your business what I wear.\" Attacking is, \"Everything you value about yourself is worthless in my eyes because I don't feel the same.\" I'm not saying op couldn't be offended or salty about the swimsuit comment, but it was a knife fight and she brought a gun.", "And she made an assumption that just because she birthed someone she can\u2019t dress or wear what she wants. That\u2019s an asshole thing to do. She just said being a mom isn\u2019t a personality trait which it isn\u2019t. it\u2019s just something you are by extension of the act of birthing a human. If Rebecca has to bring being a mother and her child I to everything that\u2019s a HER issue.", "I don\u2019t see OP\u2019s retort as being any ruder than the one Rebecca made, unprompted and unprovoked. \n\nIn fact, what Rebecca said was a quadruple-punch combo aimed at OP by (1) questioning OP\u2019s right to be an autonomous sexual being (i.e., not to be confined to unsexy mummy muumuus for eternity); (2) criticizing her tastes; (3) shitting on her work; (4) judging her parenting choices. \n\nIf anything, Rebecca was the one who shot the opening salvo in the mommy wars here. She opened herself up to being engaged on that same topic. \n\nHonestly, as harsh as OP\u2019s retort might seem, I hope this gives Rebecca something to think about \u2014 because she is surely many other great things in addition to being a mom (which is a wonderful and admirable thing, don\u2019t get me wrong). \n \nYes, OP chose not to de-escalate, but what she said doesn\u2019t make her an asshole. NTA.", "There is a difference between being passionate about something , and that thing being your entire personality. If someone engages me on a topic i am passionate about, i can talk for hours on it. But its not the only thing that interests me and i can have conversations about other things. Pretending that women whose entire personality is their children or their status as a mother aren't unhealthy is insane. You would look down and judge a neckbeard who only existed for his figurine collection, or a horse girl, but not someone who has lost themselves in motherhood? get some perspective.", "I feel like so many people come to this sub just wanting to hear that it's ok to be an AH as long as the other person was an AH first.", "I don't know how much she knows about me, I know a fair bit about her from Ollie but I don't know if that's true in reverse. The thing is, when you don't know someone, you can engage them on pretty much any topic or ask them what their interests are. Certainly when you can see they are constantly trying to steer the conversation away from something, even if it's something you have in common, you wouldn't continue trying to make them talk about it. Even if it's us and our husbands she tries to start a bilateral conversation about motherhood, surely if she didn't know what else in common she'd prefer for us to engage as part of a group?", "Rebecca brought up it not being appropriate as a mom, OP was only saying that being a mom shouldn't be a factor in it. Rebecca was the one attacking and brought up the whole mom thing.", "Being passionate about motherhood is not wrong or bad. Neither is not being passionate about it. Both women in this scenario are being judgmental of each other for no good reason other than their own senses of superiority."]}
