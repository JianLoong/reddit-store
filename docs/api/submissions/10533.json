My friend Ollie and his wife Rebecca have a daughter, Beth (4). Ollie and I have been friends for ten years, he's been with Rebecca for six. Rebecca and I have never had any issues, but I wouldn't say I know her very well. \n\nMy husband and I settled abroad full time last year as Maddie started school. I hadn't seen Ollie in a while, so I invited him and his family to visit us for a week. \n\nI absolutely adore Maddie, and being her mother is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. That said, the meta experience of \"motherhood\" is something I just don't identify with. When I'm in social situations, I talk about Maddie when it's topical, but I don't talk about what it's like \"to be a mother\", I don't talk about parenting, or kids. Conversely, this is the only thing Rebecca talks about. If she's not trying to gather a consensus on parenting, she's pre-packing snacks a day in advance even though anywhere we're going is ten metres from a cafe. It can be very tiring, especially as most of the time these conversations are directed solely at me, and she can be very judgemental if I try to shut the conversation down.\n\nSo, five days into the visit we all decided to go in the hot tub after the kids went to bed. My husband was fetching drinks so when I went out to the hot tub only Rebecca and Ollie were there. Ollie asked if the swimsuit was my design (I design some of my own clothes as a hobby) and I said yes, and Rebecca commented that it was \"a bit risqu\u00e9 for a mum\". At this point, I was just so tired of hearing the word come out of her mouth. I said, \"what exactly does that mean? Do you realise being a mother isn't a personality?\". Rebecca started tearing up and Ollie was trying to calm her down. Eventually, she got out and went upstairs, and Ollie thought it was best to give her some space. He said it was a harsh thing to say considering how Rebecca throws herself into parenting, but I made the point that since I've had a kid, he doesn't treat me any differently so why is it fair that his wife does. He said it's just different because I'm not a \"mum-ish\" type mother while Rebecca is so it basically is her whole personality. The next day, I did say I was sorry if I'd upset her, and Rebecca said it was fine and she was just tired, but it was awkward the rest of the trip. \n\nI've spoken to other friends about this and most say I was cold to say that to Rebecca because obviously being a mother is her entire identity and I basically told her it wasn't allowed to be. I understand where they're coming from but didn't she basically tell me it had to be mine, also? People also say Rebecca's way of being is completely normal and I don't understand because all my friends are either men or don't have kids. I don't think I'm wrong for what I said, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm not the AH, so, am I?", "created_utc": 1676978818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11818sk/aita_for_telling_someone_being_a_mother_is_not_a/", "score": 2551, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I see it much more often with the women in the couples I'm friends with that the *only* thing they talk about is their kids and being a parent. It's soooooooo fucking boring.

Rebecca wasn't just judgemental about your swimsuit, she'd been judgemental about not being as good a Mum as she was all holiday. Every chat about parenting and judgemental if you try and show interest in anything else.\n\nYour comment was that you think there is more to life than being a parent. And weirdly so does Rebecca, she only hyperfocused on you, the mother. Is she from a strict culture or religion because she has internalised fact that once a mother, you cease to exist as a person. And that was a good reality check for her. People have different beliefs. (edit to say: the men are also AHs as implying your need to be more than a mother conditioned because talking mainly to men and childless women. Wonder if they encouraged Rebecca so you'd see the light). \n\nDelivery a bit harsh maybe hence the ESH but understand why after drip, drop of judgement. She just got the same judgement back.

It would be great if both of you realized that there are different ways to be a parent & other people don\u2019t have to do it the same way you do. It\u2019s fine if Rebecca wants to pack snacks that suit her & her kids rather than spending the time & money to buy things from cafes. In the instant case at the hot tub, Rebecca said something minorly rude, & instead of rolling your eyes, you got out the big guns & blasted her entire life. That was way out of line. Your so called apology was another AH thing to say. An apology is, \u201cI am sorry I said or did\u201d whatever it was. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had a bad reaction\u201d just absolves you & puts the blame on her. Rebecca was gracious enough to accept it. You should try being gracious, too.", "Rebecca's way of being isn't normal. What's she going to do when Ollie is 18 and she has to actually get her own life?\n\nESH   She started it with the negging on \"how a mother should be\" which is what you should have taken issue with (there is no way for a mother to be, risque or not) and you shouldn't have said what you did.", "YTA. You said something hurtful on purpose, from a place of anger. Textbook asshole move.", "ESH. \n\nDid you ever stop to think the reason she packs snacks is because they can't afford to go to every cafe? \n\nI think she's jealous of you and wishes she had your freedom, your carefree attitude, your financial situation, and your free time/hot bod. \n\nThe comment, isn't that too risque wasn't directed at your momhood as the comment suggests, she was getting at the bathing suit is a bit too sexual to wear around her husband. My money is on the fact she's jealous of your relationship with her husband. She probably thinks he loves how you're not bogged down in momhood. \n\nA lot of women struggle to find their identity after becoming a mum. Stop ripping them down. Instead of being all nasty, you could have said, hey you should try wearing a sexy bathing suit too. It's empowering. You'd look fabulous in a piece like this, you should try something like it or I know the perfect suit you can try.", "ESH. I don\u2019t agree with taking away someone\u2019s before personality, you should be able to wear what you like when appropriate and not be judged because you are a \u201cmom\u201d so Rebecca sucks for that. However, some people honestly just are \u201cmoms\u201d she\u2019s probably the one who collected all her drunk friends things and got them home when they were younger, she played with dolls and pretended they were her babies, I would disagree that mom isn\u2019t a personality, I definitely know some moms and I know some dads too.

Honestly, Rebecca sounds like an anxious parent. Like she feels like she has to do all of these things to live up to the expectation of being a SuperMum. She didn\u2019t come across as being a know it all kind of parent or anything like that, to me it came across like she has a lot of insecurities about being a mum and it\u2019s something she works hard at, maybe harder than you realise, and you\u2019re telling her she\u2019s gone overboard with it and it\u2019s too much and she hasn\u2019t taken that well. \n\nIt sounds like she even was happy to have another mum to share that burden of parental responsibility with I guess?

It just seems like her veiled disdain for you not being mom enough seems to come from a place of jealousy and non-approval, like you may be more badass/cooler than her but never mom enough, now there\u2019s where she\u2019s loads more superior than you.

You being closed minded as her is counterproductive, I agree with your touching on that. Establishing mutual trust would repair this I imagine.\n\nJust elaborating....\n\nYou are totally an AH for how you framed it, you were clearly triggered and taking her personality personally. Her comment would obviously be the straw that broke things given how you took everything else.\n\nThat said, I am more like you and I get not being 'momish' (my sitter was recently laughing with me as I added scarves to my outfit asking her if I look 'mom' enough lol). What's helped me in such situations is lightly acknowledging I am just not built like that.\n\nEg.\n\n\\- 'I'm learning on the job when it comes to parenting, definitely different to being the workaholic.'\n\n\\- 'I couldn't do what you do, I need to get away and work, etc. I admire SAHM, childcare workers etc. lol'\n\nSure they can be projecting, like that comment, but you dropping to that level and doing the same thing still is not cool. I genuinely don't feel like my life is less than I guess, so I don't take it personally at all. I take it as a perspective they don't fully understand, and I don't get theirs so I get it.\n\nMy approach generally works. I either get moms who agree with me, have their own thing going etc. (and sometimes I realise their mom look was misleading) - and/or sometimes we connect over the fact they give me good childcare tips (yay shortcuts!), and they find me a breath of fresh air (as one friend put it 'yes, they do mostly spend their time gossiping, and get out of touch with the world and news' lol). I wouldn't even know how to carry a conversation solely talking about events or people. I go off on tangents about the issues at play, or whatever.\n\nAnd then there are the rude diehard 'mom types' that will always make you feel odd, I put it down to their own insecurity and need to feel better than. It doesn't bother me, we don't become coffee buddies. I have a polite indifference, cause it just ain't my jam. I do work with them on volunteer stuff etc. cause I want to learn enough about this parenting stuff to manage my kid's needs, be involved in activities etc. In that sense you are also benefiting from making them your allies (imho it is smarter to), so you can maintain a balanced lifestyle yourself. It helps to have those different perspectives on childrearing, they've studied that in depth while you've been busy living your best life.\n\nNo shame or judgment to whichever way from me, imho. I'm loving being a single mom, still ambitious, find it awesome having a kid full of character, imagination and love of adventure. I do read and work on childrearing (just more project managed - it doesn't take over my life). I don't pretend I don't need to know about the mom stuff, and I don't depreciate the time and effort such parents put in (and what they're giving up to do so). I see them as the network that keeps me in touch with the parenting side of my responsibilities and loves. I manage doing it all in a way/to an extent, does not mean I am not aware of how much I juggle and the value they have for being focused on parenting in depth.\n\nI don't agree they have to dress a certain way of course and my usual response to such comments (even about themselves) is 'please, you look good and you should wear what ever gives you joy! Encourage your kids to do the same too, and they love seeing us happy and dressed up. ;)'\n\nHope this helps repair things. She should not feel insecure for her life choices, neither should you.

I wasn\u2019t the center of my own universe anymore. I had to change priorities. Had to change the vehicles we had, the schedule, the places we ate, so so many things.

You have to be prepared so all those tiny splashes of time you wouldn't necessarily have otherwise aren't yours. How much summed up time is that? If you forget to prepack food when you're poor and you can't go out to eat, your kids will go hungry. Your experience of being a mother isn't the same because you didn't need to define your personality by whether you're a mother or not. You've had time to define yourself because you are able to with the life you lead. Other people's experiences may not be so luxurious. And I say this with the empathy of a full time worker, because being a mother is a full time job too. I don't have kids but I'm aware of it. I really feel like you should be more sympathetic", "YTA.

Even though you are not offering her the same respect. You look down on SAHM\u2019s and you have made it very clear that you think you are better than her and that the things she cares about are ridiculous. My guess is that this has become very obvious to her as you probably aren\u2019t that great of an actress. You may not have said it outright but people can feel when you don\u2019t respect them. Especially women and moms who are already experiencing this judgement from society. \n\nYour values seem to align with mainstream capitalist ideology. Your value is based on accomplishments that can be monetized or creating an image that is envied by onlookers. \n\nHer values are more traditional. Taking on a caregiver role to support her husband and their growing children is important. Her attachment with her children, her children\u2019s health and education, etc, are things that she has taken on as her responsibility. She finds joy and success in creating a healthy, happy family. \n\nYour views are different. You made different choices and have different ideas of what is happiness. Neither is more or less than the other. Feminism isn\u2019t about succeeding in capitalism, while also being a mother, or to dress however you want without being judged. It\u2019s the ability to choose and to be respected no matter what choice you make. \n\nTo her. Making and bringing snacks for her children is her way of supporting her family. It\u2019s important to her that her kids have nutritious food available, and it\u2019s important for her family that she isn\u2019t spending money on an overpriced piece of cake described as a muffin. \nIt seems a little ridiculous that you feel the need to judge or be annoyed by these choices. \n\nBeing a mother is her identity right now and she is passionate about. Pregnancy, childbirth and everything that encompasses being a mother has inspired her to take on this identity that she is proud of. Why are you cutting it down? Just because you don\u2019t feel the same way? Some would argue that her interests are more in tune with nature, rather than the capitalist, materialistic, status centred society that humans have created. \n\nThis just seems a lot like women cutting down other women and it\u2019s pretty ridiculous. \nShe should not be judging your choices to show your body. But it seems like you have already created a pretty judgemental environment here. \nThis comment might have been a good opportunity for you to explain that even mom\u2019s can show off their bodies even though society tells us we shouldn\u2019t. That all women have the right to express themselves and shouldn\u2019t feel ashamed too. But instead you took it as an opportunity to cut her down for doing an already thankless, under appreciated job. She probably already gets all the judgment from men and boomers in her life. She doesn\u2019t need it from you too. She is probably trying to connect with you over something you all have in common - parenthood. \n\nYou probably wouldn\u2019t be the asshole if you hadn\u2019t spent the entire post explaining what a simpleton you thought she was for enjoying her identity as a mother.

I mean, for sure, she meant that as a mother, you should be more conservative and less, female......because that's her identity now. But by responding like this you're just ignoring the jab and putting it back in her face that, you can still be a woman and have a nice bathing suit despite having had a child. \n\nI can't have children of my own (have known since I was 15) and live my \"motherhood\" through my step children (respecting boundaries from themselves and their parents of course). I never really wanted to have kids (maybe because I made my peace with it young) but I'm happy with the kids in my life and I do have a parental role with them (I've been in their lives since they were 2 and 4 and have done everything from bath time, whipping bums, homework, story time, bed time routine, lunches, picking up/dropping off at school, comforted them when they got hurt, broke up fights, you name it). We are very much a family of 4 and although I'm called by my first name, the kids consider me like a second mom when they're at our place (50/50 custody). I have a great relationship with their mother. It's a success story as far as blended families go. But I do realize that blended families come with time apart from children and I never gave birth to them so I don't have that \"made them from my flesh\" feeling.\n\nMy best friend always wanted to have kids/be a mom. She tried for years, eventually resorting to in vitro which resulted in two beautiful babies (5 and 1) that she loves more than life itself. She is a quintessential \"mom\". She has lost any interest in doing anything that involves not having her kids around, she dresses the part, acts the part, blames every forgetful moment on \"mom brain\" you name it. She also complains that she doesn't see her friends anymore. So we had a get together last month with all our friend group, going to her house (any party we expect her to attend is done at her place, always cuz \"she loves to host\", or \"it's easier with the kids that way\" and if we offer to have it done at one of our houses, she will always recommend we move the party to her place). And within the first few minutes, she said that she was just so happy to see us all, it had been faaaaar too long and you know \"she just doesn't know how to not be a mom anymore\". \n\nTo me, on a personal level, it was just a very ridiculous phrase. But I know, she just lives for this stage in her life, she wanted to be a mom so desperately and she just loves them so damn much and I know that one day, she'll be in the stage every parent finds themselves when their kids grow up and start doing their own thing and mom/dad is just not cool anymore and I know it will break her heart........and aside from finding her slightly annoying, who am I to make her feel like she's wrong. It's my opinion that making \"being a mom\" your whole personality is kinda silly, but to her, it's her whole world and I love her so, I let her be the momest mom ever. I accommodate her need to be always near her kids because, frankly, I can. \n\nBut definitely, don't let any \"momsies\" shove it in your face that you're not like them.

Not because you don't make motherhood your personality - but why can't being a mother be a personality?   \nI mean if it's something you enjoy, you are part of mom groups and invest your time in it- what's the problem? \n\n  \nMost moms fall into these groups to help with loneliness and isolation. They basically use info and experiences to guide them and often friendships do develop and grow with the kids and evolve beyond the kids. But mostly they are just like minded people who enjoy parenthood and it can be a personality. Maybe it seems boring to a lot of people, but dont a lot of things seem boring to a lot of people?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n I personally find gaming extremely boring. My kids will watch people doing youtube videos of theirselves playing games and all they do is talk about gaming and their lives really revolve around it. It's a personality. It's not MY personality and I personally would rather be outside or something but I'm not going to say \"hey, thats not a personality, get a life\". Because to them it's exactly what they want to be doing, it's enjoyable, a community and enriching to them. Just like motherhood is to many women. They found a place to belong. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd yes, there are some weird rules to \"belong\" in mom groups and often you are kind of cast out if you don't comply and wearing \"risky\" clothes happens to sometimes be part of that, depending on your social circle. Because yes, despite making motherhood or parenting a personality there are faucets to that personality which include fashion. You'll notice a lot of moms all follow the same fashion trends. So maybe she's been conditioned to think certain things are taboo because she doesn't want to be cast out of her groups. Many groups have weird little taboos. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I do think it's entirely ok to make being a mother a personality. It's a phase of life. People will eventually move past it as their children have grown (my kids range from 20-6) so most of the friends I made who have 20 year olds have expanded their personality and we enjoy new things together.

You don't have to roll over for them, but you can show your backbone in a way that doesn't in turn insult something about them.

Everyone in the comments is hitting the nail on the head. We live in a world where young girls are told to dream and fantasize about marriage and babies. Then when they fall in love and have their babies they're no longer the woman they were. They're just mom and wife, nothing else at all. Might as well forget they ever had a name in the first place. Women then devote all of themselves to uphold this standard, they sacrifice everything for it. Then suddenly 18 years have gone by, your child moves out of the house and starts their new life and it feels likes you're starting a new one yourself. Or like you're pressing resume on a movie that's been paused for 18 years. That movie being yourself and your life, someone you completely forgot about and left behind.  Women who lived like this throughout their motherhood have such a hard time with letting go of their kids once they've moved out because for them, they're not just letting their kids go, they're letting go of the only life they've known for 18years. They don't wanna start over. So naturally, they console themselves by reassuring themselves that they had to do this in order to be a good mom and wife. But that notion is challenged when they see other women who have defied the social standard that states \"once a woman is mom and wife that's all that she is. No longer an individual\". When they see women who are great moms, and wives but still have a social life, careers, hobbies, etc.; they're still individuals. They have no choice but to realize that they could have gone that route but they chose not to and lost all that time forever because of it. So of course, what's the one thing they can do to console themselves through this? Live in denial while vehemently judging any mother who is happy still being an individual. Because sadly, that illusion of a moral high ground is all they have left...\n\nI became aware of the fact that my mom wasn't like most mom's when I was about 15-16years old.

I know this is gonna sound harsh... but they were some of the most miserable people I've ever met. They were VERY gossipy and we're very judgy about everyone, including the innocent kids who were just being kids. Not only that but you could tell they just didn't take very good care of themselves. They were almost always very over weight, had no sense of style or identity and pretty much only talked about their kids or motherhood. They were also all helicopter mom's and drove the athletes and the coaches nuts. Never giving their kids any space. And tbh, I actually find this parenting style to be toxic and selfish. Cuz you're basically making your children responsible for your own happiness and sense of accomplishment. So when they're not being perfect angels, going in the direction you want them to or simply move out an move on, you can't help but feel like your child is attacking you. \"I've done and given everything for you! And this is what I get for it??? This is how you repay me??? You go and leave me??\"\n\nMy mom on the other hand, is honestly one of the coolest people I've ever met. I look up to her more than anyone else in this world tbh. For my entire life my mom has had a career, social life and a few hobbies. I think because she always is making time for herself, she's just genuinely a really happy person so she's always great company. She shines bright. And while I wasn't able to spend every second with her in my childhood because she was so busy, she was still present and I was still with her almost every day. We are and will always be close and I've never once felt neglected or left out of her life. She's also a ton of fun, parties, is super raunchy, has a great sense of humor and wears heels and bikinis in her 50s. She doesn't give a damn what people think of her and I rarely meet people as free and content with themselves as much as my mom is. So yeah, she never came to my practices, but she always came to my comps and we had a great time together. And to be completely honest.. YOUR KIDS DONT WANT YOU AT THEIR PRACTICES. They need a break from you too, let them have some independence. I had an amazing mom and hope to be just like her when I become a mom. So please, don't fall into the trap society tries to set for mother's. You'll be so much happier if you don't!", "ESH. Both her comment and your response were unnecessary and thoughtless. She clearly loves being a mother. Even if it's tiresome for you, and I personally find it strange, it still brings her joy. Accept that she enjoys her life differently than you do.", "Yta, all you had to say is \u201cmums can wear whatever we want\u201d.", "NTA, you gave back the energy she gave you.", "NTA \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll I've ever wanted to be was a Mum. My dad had to coax me into career choices and education decisions \"as back ups\"\n\nI choose teacher, Kindergarten teacher.... lmao \n\n  \nHOWEVER. It is not 100% of my personality. I also read, write, do amateur photography, art, obsess over tv shows, love languages (I technically speak 5 but not fluently).  \nBeing a mother is essential for society and amazing and wonderful. I adore my girls... \n\nBut. It is not everything I am. I would be so very bored and boring if it were.  \n\n\nShe got upset because like many women she decided to leave behind most of herself when she became a mother. Unfortunately many societies expect that. It was her choice to do that though. And maybe she regrets not doing things she used to enjoy and is a bit resentful. Maybe she truly made herself the quintessential Mom and loves every minute. It doesn't matter.\n\nWhat matters is she was being judgy and trying to make you into her vision of what is \"appropriate\" for a mother. She was offensive and you called her out on it. Good for you Op.", "NTA.  We are more than just mothers, daughters, etc.  People lose themselves in these roles and often forget who they use to be or who they want to be.  Others go further and think that everyone should stick to the role according to their own idea of it.  We are all individuals that may be part of many roles and should not necessarily adhere to what is \"normal\" for said roles.  \n\nYou seem at peace with who you are and that probably pricks at Rebecca because she has decided to let herself be defined in a more \"restrictive\" mother role.  Either she can not see herself outside of it because she's made it who she is now, or she feels a bit of regret or jealousy because she is seeing another mother who thrives outside her conception of the mother role.  Approach her with more empathy going forward, but do not let her try to push you into her idea of motherhood.", "ESH\n\nShe was rude, you addressed a trend she likely isn\u2019t aware is an issue.", "NTA\n\nHowever, maybe a comment that targeted her sexism and her unwillingness to mind her damn business would have been 1) funnier, and 2) gotten your point across better, and 3) might have avoided some conflict since it wasn't a jab at her personality.\n\n\"Next time, I'm going to design a swimsuit even skimpier just to piss you off.\" would have been my response.", "NTA,  you didn't comment on her personally.  You responded to her incredibly rude comment about your bathing suit.  What the hell did she mean?  Are moms only allowed to wear one piece bathing suits?  Was she expecting some pantaloons and a turtleneck?  On top of it, she was potentially insulting your own design.  You were not out of line.", "Honestly, this is something I've had to remind my wife of her entire pregnancy. I had to remind her that, even though she is having a child she is still an individual person. Yes, she is a mom now, but that doesn't mean she stops being 'her' and enjoying the things and activities she previously did. Becoming a parent is an addiction to your personality as a whole, not a replacement.", "NTA", "So she thinks mothers shouldn't wear anything sexy? She knows that's how they got be mothers...right? LOL I seriously feel bad for her husband. He lost his wife when his kid was born...now he's married to his kids mom that sounds like she's stuck in the 50s! How long till he can't take it anymore? \n\nYou're NTA she was basically slut shaming you over a bathing suit that wasn't her style. Using your kid to do it is despicable!", "NTA. Add me to the bandwagon of non-momish moms because I would also like to know what she meant by that comment. Last I checked, popping out tiny humans has less than nothing to do with what style of swimsuit I choose. I also don't plan on foregoing crop tops in the year of our lord 2023 either, not with it already feeling like summer in February in my corner of the world. If that's the journey she wants to be on, great, but the rest of us are just as free to be as 'risque' as we please. All I did was pop a kid out, it's not like I died.", "I read her comment more like \u201cwhy is my husband complimenting and inspecting another woman\u2019s skimpy bikini right in front of me\u201d and then he stayed behind with you in the hot tub instead of checking on her after you insulted her\u2026it\u2019s got nothing to do with being a mom", "NTA\n\nSorry, but you don't get to shame someone's clothes choices and then cry when you get called out on it.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nMight get downvoted for this, but she basically slut-shamed you because you are now a mom, and it doesn't fit what she considers to be \"non-slutty\" outfit for a mom. You have every right to stick up for yourself; you weren't even that mean tbh.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nShe loves being a mother. Most likely has been her dream since she was younger. My wife is the same way. She loves spending time with our children and constantly does little things to make them happy. Nothing wrong with that.", "ESH she shouldn\u2019t have made the bathing suit comment but you were rude as well. It\u2019s perfectly fine for different women to have a different approach to motherhood. Neither of you are wrong. She\u2019s not wrong to be completely immersed in it and you aren\u2019t wrong to do things your way.", "Esh. I think what she said about your suit was NOT okay. I think you might have found a way to express that without expressing what is clearly disdain for her choices. I might offer you the perspective that sometimes people throw themselves into something because if they don\u2019t, they fail. It might be easier for you to multitask. She may be making her entire life about one task because she\u2019s struggling with it. I think you were already judging her and she knew it.", "NTA. That is all.", "NTA...I've had more than a few friends and family members that after they gave birth they became a completely different person and being a mom becomes their entire identity (including quitting really good careers) and I literally don't understand it.", "NTA Hopefully it\u2019ll stop her boring someone else to death.", "NAH. You weren\u2019t the asshole, and neither was she, even if it was a bit harsh. Although she should keep her mouth shut about other people\u2019s fashion choices.", "This one's tough because frankly I don't think you're a very nice person--most people don't have to keep reminding people that they love their kid. It comes off a bit 'protests too much' and, as someone else said, a bit of a 'pick me girl'.\n\nHOWEVER. It sounds like you've been putting up with her extra ness....fairly well.  It sounds like the whole issue is about the bathing suit. And in that case, Rebecca was WAY out of line, and out of line first.  Not just for judging what another woman wears but for what you wear...in your own home?!?  You had every right to clap back at her, and as we used to say, don't start nothin', won't be nothin'...and she started something.  SO you finished it.  Wear your sexy as hell swimsuits.\n\nHonestly I think she's got some bigger issues. This all sounds really performative on her part.  Has anyone done any talking to her about post partum depression? There's a reason she's clinging this hard to the identity and if she's not some kind of weird mommyblogger...there's something pathological.  \n\nGrudgingly though NTA", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have said that about your bathing suit. It was rude and inappropriate. That said, you\u2019re being an AH to her. You have done nothing but judge her when she\u2019s doing nothing wrong. She probably also doesn\u2019t love it that her whole personality is being a mom. Losing yourself in motherhood sucks and it\u2019s not actually easy to dig out of. There are other mothers I dislike for various reasons, but I don\u2019t say asshole things to their face because I know that I\u2019m the problem, not them.", "Idc what anyone says. If you have kids you\u2019re a person first and a parent second. Not every aspect of your being has to revolve around your children. It\u2019s okay to have a life outside of them.", "Yeah mothers should only wear house dresses and overcoats ... nta a mother can wear whatever she wants", "NTA. She insulted your choice of bathing suit and you had enough of her judgy self. She needs to apologize to you.", "NTA.\n\nI'm a SAHM, but I desperately try and find others who don't just want to talk about their kids.\n\nI have hobbies, I do freelance work, and have an identity besides my kids.\n\nIt is very hard to find others who feel like I do. I often feel like I'm the bottom barrel of the mom universe. There are these amazing moms that do everything for their kids and more while looking perfect and I'm not that. I would love to be able to do that concept, but it isn't me.\n\nI understand the defensive reaction you had and I get it, but I know there are a lot of women who think and are taught to see that their motherhood is their only identity. It feels like this woman might be one of those who doesn't have anything else but her kids. The reaction she had might actually be a sign she is struggling with that exact issue. Maybe you hit a little too close to home and set her off.\n\nIt isn't your responsibility, but maybe the fact you are confident, maybe you could help her? Have a book reading night? Podcast listen party? Maybe she is actually really stress or felt threatened because you are put together?", "NTA. I'm a mom, and I love my children, but to be honest, I'm not just a mom. I'm a woman with desires, wants, and needs as well. My whole identity isn't mom, or boy mom, or Autistic mom. It's hey, I'm Aray, I have kids, but I'm also a woman who is a bit of a comic geek and has an unhealthy addiction to caffeine, chocolate, and reading smut. If you want your whole personality to be mom, then go for it, but don't mom shame me.", "NTA! You are correct, we are more than just mothers, we can be cute and wear risqu\u00e9 things when we aren't around our kids, it's what lingerie is for even. Our whole being doesn't have to revolve around our children and such. It's not an identity but part of who we are.", "NTA", "Nta. It\u2019s true. We need to teach this to our kids too. I\u2019ve got 3, I love them, always wanted to be a mum, but I\u2019m a person before I\u2019m a mum. Plus what BS hey. We have to act like it\u2019s all we should focus on but no pressure on dads to change? It\u2019s a load of bollocks ( I love that word )", "NTA she should shut the fucking", "Two things\n\nNTA. Her risqu\u00e9 comment was mean. Moms can still wear clothes that they used to wear when they were childless. Heck, if you have the confidence then go for it. As long as you're not showing your hoo has to the kids, it should be fine. It is archaic to think that moms should be covered from head to toe just because they became moms.\n\nYour reply to her comment only sounds mean because it shows your judgment of her during their stay. \n\nMotherhood can be different for every mother. Some may embrace it (and hey, be their personality!) and some may see it as another part of their life. Some may find it as an experience that outweighs their other experiences. Who knows? Maybe that's all they can think about because that's the first time in their life they have made such a huge effort. As long as they are not harming anyone, who shouldn't judge them for that.\n\nBut in this situation, Rebecca does sound like she forces the people around her to listen and even expects you to act the same. She might be a product of conservative ideas, especially the misogynistic view that moms should revolve their whole life to parenthood.", "So no one addressed the fact that Rebecca made an out-of-the-blue, uncalled for jab at you before you had done anything to her? They're only focusing on what you said *back* to her? I would not have handled it as well as you did, and I would not have apologized. You have a right to not have your clothing and lifestyle insulted in your own home. NTA", "+\u2070", "Agreed. It was a seriously rude thing to say to OP. She should have been crying in embarrassment rather than as a reaction to OP\u2019s response.", "OP is NTA for not wanting everything in life to be centered around her being a mom but a little bit of an AH for saying that to her. But she was an AH for the risque comment so I can't fault OP. There's a whole mommy cult and they're exhausting to deal with. I'm not surprised OP snapped.", "being a eager invested mother is most certainly a personality. they were both AHs in this situation.", "The first thing my hubbie said to me about sexuality after our first was ...\n\n\\*gasp!\\* \"You're a MILF now!\" with a delighted grin on his face... He's pretty great sometimes haha", "Well, isn't that why parents mostly hang out with other parents? My husband and I are childfree, and while we are friends with some couples with kids, we don't see them very often, because, you know...they're busy with their kids. \n\nWe don't really mind them talking about their kids though. It's an interesting glimpse into a life we don't have (and an excellent reminder of why we don't want it)!", "Not everyone is annoyed. I enjoy talking about kids. I enjoy other things, too, but kids are part of my life, so they are fair game when it comes to conversation topics, IMO. If others have other topics, they can feel free to bring them up and we can discuss those things, too.", "I feel like this could be a soft ESH or a NAH situation; both parties were a little out of line but to an approximately equal and not huge degree, in my opinion. \"Risque for a mum\" is an eyeroll kind of statement, but it's also a bit aggressive to say being a mom *isn't* a personality when it can be for some and seemingly is for that person. I think apologizing and making up is the right way to go about things, and if everyone involved is decently mature this hopefully does not have to go any further as an issue.", "I agree.", "I wish I had an award for this comment", "Good thing that inappropriate judgment wasn't met with a personal attack, then.", "Got. You reduce people to stereotypes by knowing one thing about them.", "Why does the subject of your kids come up if you are talking about your hobbies?\n\nSo if you like stamp collecting/video games/insert random hobby, why can you talk about those things in isolation?", "yeah, my mom sorta did this. and she felt that it was really unhealthy. everything was about us kids.\n\nand she loved us- still does. but she'll be the first to tell anyone that the best thing you can do for your kids is to have you time, have couple time, don't forget that you are an individual.\n\nbecause you'll be a better mom and a happier mom if everything isn't about your kids.\n\n(she'll also admit this really requires a support system.)", "Yes! Exactly. I was a SAHM as well, and I tended to do the same as you. My biggest problem was the age at which I had my children. By the time I was 21, I was the mother of a 5yr, 3yr, and newborn. This meant that all my friends were still out partying, and most of the mothers with kids the same age as mine were at least 5/10 years older than me. I was lucky that my mother and I were very close. She helped me see that making my kids my sole focus wasn't a good idea. As she said, once your kids are gone out into the world, you don't want to turn around and realise that you have lost yourself and have no idea how to talk to your husband. So I changed focus, I began to plan what I would do once the kids were all at school, and focused more on my relationship with hubby. That worked well for me.\n\n Unfortunately, there seemed to be a divide between working women and SAHMs. I remember going to a work function my hubby had. All the women there were married but childless at that time. One asked me what I did, the minute I said I was a SAHM I was dismissed as unimportant and they didn't speak to me again. I also noticed that whenever I was with other SAHMs ALL they talked about was their children and how terrible their partner was. It was maddening to be honest. \n\nAll and all I'm very happy with my life. Having my kids ridiculously young meant that hubby and I are now in our middle 60s and will soon celebrate 50 years of marriage. Not bad considering that when we got married, at 16 and 18, the bet was it wouldn't last a year lol.", "So much this. I don't have kids, but I have seen and see so many moms that totally seem to be only moms. \"Hi, I am Stevie 's mom, etc.\" Even as monikers on gaming or other sites. Yes, you are, but if I'm meeting you in person, who else are you??  I'd rather hear \"Hi, I'm Evelyn, and Stevie's mom (if he's there). And it's nice to hear the \"and\" as opposed to \"Evelyn, Stevie 's mom.\" Darn it, you are a whole person by yourself. I can almost tell what the conversation will be like based on that.", "Just hear to say I have no idea why you are being downvoted\u2026.", "Oh, you don't like that? Because you said you don't know much about Rebecca but reduced her to \"your personality is a mum.\"\n\nSee how that works? That's why you are not remotely blameless here.", "Because it WAS an attack. That\u2019s how OP meant it. She doesn\u2019t like the way Rebecca does motherhood and made the comment to attack her about it. Rebecca shouldn\u2019t have made the swim suit remark, but OP\nwas no better with her reply.", "\"Everything you value about yourself is worthless in my eyes because I don't feel the same.\"\n\nGood thing she never said anything of the sort, then. Or even implied it. \n\nHoly projection, Batman.", "Tell your husband to back off.  3 kids is plenty and you deserve some of your identity back", "The reason I feel that way is because all Rebecca has ever allowed me to see about her personality is \"mum\". That's her choice, but that's what she chooses to show me for the time that I've known her, which is considerably more than one conversation.\n\nMy having male friends is a singular statement upon which you've based your opinion about my entire attitude to social interaction. It's not the same.\n\nI never said I was blameless, what I said to her was dick-ish behaviour and quite petty, I can own that. I'm not an AH or a pick-me just because I have male friends though.", "That might be your viewpoint which is fine. But not everyone feels that way. Some people love the fact that they are \u201cmom first\u201d. You don\u2019t, that\u2019s cool too but it doesn\u2019t make them wrong", "It's not singularly that; it's what you've chosen to show us. It's in your comments, your behavior, your interpretations, and your phrasing. I think you have a lot of self-examination to do. I personally hold to the concept that we can't control other people's behavior and attitudes, but we sure as hell can control our own, so we should probably focus on that whenever possible. Nothing Rebecca said or did excused you being an AH. You're in control of that. Stop passing the buck and looking down on other people. You're not special.", "No, but projecting it onto other people and expecting them to be the same as them is wrong and that's what Rebecca did to OP.", "Do you realize that not every statement that starts with \u201cdo you realize\u201d is intended to be mean or harsh in any way? Kinda like this one.", "Totally agree which is why this is an ESH situation.", "Well, that's your prerogative, but I genuinely didn't. I have other friends I keep up with in the same way, they don't have an issue with it, neither does my husband. Genuinely I never considered it, but you don't have to believe me.", "I don\u2019t and neither does his wife.", "Ahhh, no, it's definitely not one of those. Ollie and I aren't best friends, I've never made those kind of overtures. I'd feel bad if it came across as something untoward, it genuinely never crossed my mind that it would. My husband is fine with it, I have the same relationship with multiple other people who are in relationships, we don't find it weird. I guess I always thought if she found it uncomfortable that Ollie would act differently. Maybe it's just me being naive.", "NTA. As someone who is child free it is very draining for someone to only talk about their kids. Especially since she opened the door to critiques if she is going to judge you, why can't you do it back.", "Reminds me of that SNL sketch for mom jeans \"because you're not a woman anymore, you're a mom\".", "But she didn\u2019t say that.
