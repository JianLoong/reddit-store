My friend Ollie and his wife Rebecca have a daughter, Beth (4). Ollie and I have been friends for ten years, he's been with Rebecca for six. Rebecca and I have never had any issues, but I wouldn't say I know her very well. \n\nMy husband and I settled abroad full time last year as Maddie started school. I hadn't seen Ollie in a while, so I invited him and his family to visit us for a week. \n\nI absolutely adore Maddie, and being her mother is the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. That said, the meta experience of \"motherhood\" is something I just don't identify with. When I'm in social situations, I talk about Maddie when it's topical, but I don't talk about what it's like \"to be a mother\", I don't talk about parenting, or kids. Conversely, this is the only thing Rebecca talks about. If she's not trying to gather a consensus on parenting, she's pre-packing snacks a day in advance even though anywhere we're going is ten metres from a cafe. It can be very tiring, especially as most of the time these conversations are directed solely at me, and she can be very judgemental if I try to shut the conversation down.\n\nSo, five days into the visit we all decided to go in the hot tub after the kids went to bed. My husband was fetching drinks so when I went out to the hot tub only Rebecca and Ollie were there. Ollie asked if the swimsuit was my design (I design some of my own clothes as a hobby) and I said yes, and Rebecca commented that it was \"a bit risqu\u00e9 for a mum\". At this point, I was just so tired of hearing the word come out of her mouth. I said, \"what exactly does that mean? Do you realise being a mother isn't a personality?\". Rebecca started tearing up and Ollie was trying to calm her down. Eventually, she got out and went upstairs, and Ollie thought it was best to give her some space. He said it was a harsh thing to say considering how Rebecca throws herself into parenting, but I made the point that since I've had a kid, he doesn't treat me any differently so why is it fair that his wife does. He said it's just different because I'm not a \"mum-ish\" type mother while Rebecca is so it basically is her whole personality. The next day, I did say I was sorry if I'd upset her, and Rebecca said it was fine and she was just tired, but it was awkward the rest of the trip. \n\nI've spoken to other friends about this and most say I was cold to say that to Rebecca because obviously being a mother is her entire identity and I basically told her it wasn't allowed to be. I understand where they're coming from but didn't she basically tell me it had to be mine, also? People also say Rebecca's way of being is completely normal and I don't understand because all my friends are either men or don't have kids. I don't think I'm wrong for what I said, but that doesn't necessarily mean I'm not the AH, so, am I?", "created_utc": 1676978818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11818sk/aita_for_telling_someone_being_a_mother_is_not_a/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You weren't really personally attacking her; you were standing up for your own preserved sense of identity as a sexual creature (assuming based on the comment that the bathing suit was \"risque\") and individual despite also wearing the hat of \"mother.\" I'm a middle aged dad and all my friends have kids. I see it much more often with the women in the couples I'm friends with that the *only* thing they talk about is their kids and being a parent. It's soooooooo fucking boring. I can understand why a woman like that would have a level of jealousy of a woman who hasn't just handed her entire sense of self over to that mindset.", "NTA. How is a bathing suit \u201crisqu\u00e9 for a mom?\u201d She tried to shame you and you called her on it.", "NTA. It sounds like you were patient and gracious with her until she did some outdated combo punch of body-shaming and insulting your parenting values.\n\nBeing a parent is an important part of someone's identity, but everyone holds that differently. Nothing about the way you are a mom is harmful to her and you did a fine \"live and let live\" until you had to defend yourself.", "NTA.\n\nYour attire in a hot tub has nothing to do with your ability to parent, but she equated the two.\n\nShe completely and intentionally attempted to insult you (in her mind) in terms of your appearance as well as your judgment. In her mind you were basically inappropriate, simply because you were a mother.  \n\nThe fact that she was trying to do that, opens her up to any defense, even one taken as offensive.  And again it was their choice but they took it as offensive. You simply stated an actual fact", "NTA she has only herself to blame, as her remark about your swimsuit was stupid and rude.", "NTA but your words must have sounded harsh to her. I get it because I\u2019m not a \u201cmommy\u201d kind of mom either.  Never had the mini-van, didn\u2019t do play dates or soccer, basically did motherhood my way and my now-adult daughter is still a joy.", "[removed]", "NTA.  You are right on both counts - being a mother isn't a personality and she was trying to shame you for not making it your personality.  Thank you for not replacing your personality when you spawned.  Listening to \"mums\" babble on about their kids is exhausting.", "NTA.\n\nYou are correct.", "NTA i used to see my mother naked daily as a kid so i Dunno whats this mother issue is but you can be in different stages of dress when you have kids and its not crazy to dress sexy or not at all even around your kids. imo modesty has gotten out of control in the western cultures the kids arent going to be fazed by mum in a bathing suit other than wishing they hadnt seen that but thats cause your mum is alwways gross to you no matter what age", "NTA, she tries to implore her thoughts onto you. That's not okay, you retaliated, but in a very proper manner. And yeah, what was the misterious swimsuit for her to call it \"a bit risqu\u00e9 for a mum\"? Was it 100% see through or smth?", "NTA, don't make a rude comment and then get upset about the response.", "Gonna say ESH. Her comment about your swimsuit was shitty and unnecessary, your reply was also cruel.\n\nTo her, being a mother is a massive part of her identity, and that's okey, in the same way that it isn't really part of yours. It's okey to find it a bit grating, but it isn't fair to suggest it's wrong of her to define herself that way. You're just different people with different ways of viewing motherhood.", "NTA. Just because you didn'tsay it at any other time, but when she chose to comment on how you should dress \"as a mum\". \n\nIt was pretty cold though. I would take the high road and apologize again, like texting (her) \"hope you got a safe trip back, sorry again for that stupid comment blablabla.\". Just because Ollie is your bff and he will chose his wife/mother of his kid over you, and you probably don't want the friendship to change.", "ESH. Rebecca sounds tiresome and not someone I would personally get along with. And her remark was undeniably rude. But your comment was unnecessary. You could have just said \u201cwhat do you mean by that?\u201d but instead you said something that cut her to the core. I\u2019m with you in terms of the substance of the comment but you shouldn\u2019t have given voice to it.", "ESH\n\n\nHonestly, I don't like her comment to your swimwear. \n\n\n\nBut that she is passionate about parenting is not a character flaw.", "ESH but mild for you as think justified. Rebecca wasn't just judgemental about your swimsuit, she'd been judgemental about not being as good a Mum as she was all holiday. Every chat about parenting and judgemental if you try and show interest in anything else.\n\nYour comment was that you think there is more to life than being a parent. And weirdly so does Rebecca, she only hyperfocused on you, the mother. Is she from a strict culture or religion because she has internalised fact that once a mother, you cease to exist as a person. And that was a good reality check for her. People have different beliefs. (edit to say: the men are also AHs as implying your need to be more than a mother conditioned because talking mainly to men and childless women. Wonder if they encouraged Rebecca so you'd see the light). \n\nDelivery a bit harsh maybe hence the ESH but understand why after drip, drop of judgement. She just got the same judgement back. Hopefully she might think about what you said.", "YTA. It\u2019s fine that you don\u2019t like Rebecca or think she\u2019s boring, but you don\u2019t need to attack her or re-litigate the mommy wars. It would be great if both of you realized that there are different ways to be a parent & other people don\u2019t have to do it the same way you do. It\u2019s fine if Rebecca wants to pack snacks that suit her & her kids rather than spending the time & money to buy things from cafes. In the instant case at the hot tub, Rebecca said something minorly rude, & instead of rolling your eyes, you got out the big guns & blasted her entire life. That was way out of line. Your so called apology was another AH thing to say. An apology is, \u201cI am sorry I said or did\u201d whatever it was. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had a bad reaction\u201d just absolves you & puts the blame on her. Rebecca was gracious enough to accept it. You should try being gracious, too.", "Rebecca's way of being isn't normal. What's she going to do when Ollie is 18 and she has to actually get her own life?\n\nESH   She started it with the negging on \"how a mother should be\" which is what you should have taken issue with (there is no way for a mother to be, risque or not) and you shouldn't have said what you did.", "YTA. You said something hurtful on purpose, from a place of anger. Textbook asshole move.", "ESH. \n\nDid you ever stop to think the reason she packs snacks is because they can't afford to go to every cafe? \n\nI think she's jealous of you and wishes she had your freedom, your carefree attitude, your financial situation, and your free time/hot bod. \n\nThe comment, isn't that too risque wasn't directed at your momhood as the comment suggests, she was getting at the bathing suit is a bit too sexual to wear around her husband. My money is on the fact she's jealous of your relationship with her husband. She probably thinks he loves how you're not bogged down in momhood. \n\nA lot of women struggle to find their identity after becoming a mum. Stop ripping them down. Instead of being all nasty, you could have said, hey you should try wearing a sexy bathing suit too. It's empowering. You'd look fabulous in a piece like this, you should try something like it or I know the perfect suit you can try.", "ESH. I don\u2019t agree with taking away someone\u2019s before personality, you should be able to wear what you like when appropriate and not be judged because you are a \u201cmom\u201d so Rebecca sucks for that. However, some people honestly just are \u201cmoms\u201d she\u2019s probably the one who collected all her drunk friends things and got them home when they were younger, she played with dolls and pretended they were her babies, I would disagree that mom isn\u2019t a personality, I definitely know some moms and I know some dads too. It\u2019s okay to be different.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

How close are you / were you , and how often do you talk ? And whats the context around your friends saying you have only male friends", "I\u2019m struggling to make a judgement here. Honestly, Rebecca sounds like an anxious parent. Like she feels like she has to do all of these things to live up to the expectation of being a SuperMum. She didn\u2019t come across as being a know it all kind of parent or anything like that, to me it came across like she has a lot of insecurities about being a mum and it\u2019s something she works hard at, maybe harder than you realise, and you\u2019re telling her she\u2019s gone overboard with it and it\u2019s too much and she hasn\u2019t taken that well. \n\nIt sounds like she even was happy to have another mum to share that burden of parental responsibility with I guess? Though some mums will surround themselves with the same types of people, so perhaps her friends are all just like her and someone like you, who loves their child just the same of course, but who is comfortable in who they are outside of being a parent, could be a new experience for her.", "She said her husband is a 35year old female? I'm kind of confused", "ESH. True she's annoying and judgemental. But a better at to address it would have been to say that being a mother isn't YOUR whole identity. She put out a global judgement that isn't true for you ( among others) but that doesn't make it ok to respond with another, equally hurtful global judgement. I realize that Reddit generally supports tit for tat living, but it's not a way to sustain relationships, if that's what you want to do. Sit down with her privately and talk this out.", "NTA. My partner and I have made similar points during the same types of conversations. Parenting is neither of our personalities. It\u2019s never expected of fathers.  Why is it of mothers? I would say even mothers who \u201cthrow themselves into mothering\u201d shouldn\u2019t be defined by that mothering as their entire being. It should be one part of a varied set of beliefs and actions and encompassing personality.", "NTA she started with the judgemental attitude you just shut it down", "I think your frustration and being fed up with her got in the way of the point you were making to her. Saying your bathing suit was risqu\u00e9 for mom is kind of silly and I don't know why it matters if you're a mom or not. That being said, I think if you weren't coming from a place of being offended it might have went better.

I think it's fine if she wants to make her life all about being a mom. It's her life and if she wants to focus on and talk about being a mom nonstop, that's her right just as your right is to feel alienated and maybe spend less time with her. Where she crosses into AH territory is the level of passive aggressiveness and judgement she gives you. She shouldn't be commenting on your clothes, for example. But the kicker is that in that moment you were the same way. Instead of addressing how her judgment was making you feel, you heard her comment and took an opportunity to also voice your judgement toward her (which you had clearly been bottling up). Neither of you ever needed to express such negative feelings so passive aggressively to one another.", "ESH.

It doesn't excuse her behaviour , but I do wonder if she is like this with everyone . It's also a little bit clear from your post that you find her a bit annoying ( again , I can see why , but the snack comment and the way you are viewing her will be coming across ) and I do wonder how she feels about someone who is closeish to her husband feeling like that about her \n\nThat being said , if she doesn't want to be around you , Ollie is going to pick his wife and family , and you will lose that relationship, so I do not really see how your comment helped anyone , not matter how justified it might have been \n\nESH for me , you were harsh and she was judgemental .both need to either be kinder or don't be around each other", "True, but OP would have been on firmer ground by focusing on Rebecca's behavior rather than her personality."]}
