{"id": 3907, "submission_id": "zc2hvb", "title": "AITA for bringing my husband to Thanksgiving Dinner and leaving early?", "selftext": " My husband Dean (M23) and I (M22) have been married for almost 4 years. We live across the country from my family, so we usually get excluded from family events but my mom invited me this year. I didn\u2019t realize the invitation hadn\u2019t included Dean and brought him with me.\n\nBefore I start, Dean has an \u201cadopted brother\u201d. They found each other as children who needed support and have been inseparable since. His brother and I have gotten very close and I consider him to be my best friend.\n\nWe got the baking supplies Dean needed to bake the various things he would be bringing to the dinner and went to the house. As soon as we arrived, my oldest brother was surprised to see him and even commented on it, which we both brushed off. I was put on babysitting duty over my nieces. I had met the older two once and had never met the youngest but still, I had to babysit them. I did my best to watch over them and play dress up, I make a pretty good fairy princess if I do say so myself. But when we were outside I could see my mom, SIL, and her mom interrogating Dean from the kitchen window. When the girls finally had enough and decided to bother their dad, I went to find Dean who told me about some of the questions he had been asked. Highly personal questions like our sex life, his mental health, and his parent's death. I was disgusted but he told me to drop it and just get through dinner.\n\nI was willing to drop it until his answers were used to put him on blast in front of the entire dinner table. The SILs mom told the dinner table about a disgusting rumor she\u2019d heard about Dean and his brother being incestuous. I told them it wasn\u2019t true but it made my blood boil, but he grabbed my hand and told me to eat. I listened, but they didn\u2019t stop. My mother used his mental health diagnosis as a joke. I was beyond pissed and ignored Dean to ask what their problem with him was. My mom outright told me that she had never invited him and that I had brought him without thinking about how that would make them feel. I demanded they tell me how they feel about my husband, and the SILs mom once again brought up the rumor. My mom nodded and said she didn\u2019t feel comfortable around incest. I once again told her that it had never happened. But she once again said she hadn\u2019t invited Dean. I turned to my dad and asked his opinion but he just shrugged. So I picked up everything Dean had made for the dinner and we left.\n\nDean thinks I did the right thing, and I think I handled the situation to the best of my abilities. But my oldest brother, his wife, her mom, my mom, and my dad think I\u2019m the bad guy and that I need to apologize.\n\nI figured I need an outsider's opinion, so Reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1670135053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc2hvb/aita_for_bringing_my_husband_to_thanksgiving/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I genuinely don't know what changed, but honestly, I'll think about going no contact.", "I would ONLY suggest they stay in contact because there are apparently some little ones who are stuck there, and whose parents are 100% fine with foisting them on an adult they barely know. I think those kids would benefit from having some relative even distantly keeping an eye on things. Any family that would accuse someone of incest is a family I would be watching VERY VERY CLOSELY for that myself.", "Yep. I'd say NC with most of them, frankly, but if you want to keep in touch just so you can help shelter the next generation from the adults, that would be kind.

I'm not sure if he was defending himself while he was in the kitchen with them, and he had just tired himself out, or just didn't feel like it. A lot of comments have been suggesting I go no contact, and I think it is our best option.", "Yeah going no contact seems to be a really big theme throughout the comments. I was practically no contact already, this was the first invite to anything I've gotten since I moved out. And that wasn't even because we were too far.

The oldest was 13 but there was a 7, a 5, and a 3-year-old listening.

I was skeptical about it after the first few comments, but the more I see other people say it, the more it makes sense.", "My husband is known to be vindictive and nasty, so this is right up his ally. The only reason he held his tongue was that there were children present. I will definitely be passing this idea on to him.

If they weren't like this growing up you may have been the golden child who does no wrong...and now you've lost your favored position. It's also possible they got a nice poisonous dose of religion or other things, but I honestly think that such a major change in behavior? You aren't the golden child now, you're the scapegoat.", "Pretty sure, those people don't want contact between their kids and OPs husband and ultimately OP. I would value my integrity over family contact in this case.", "Are you sure? A new SIL and MIL are easy targets to blame. It's a classic tactic, in fact.", "Things like this don't just suddenly happen. They've probably been badmouthing your husband for a long time.", "Then they found other adults to support their hate and felt more confident in speaking out.", "Did you ever ask why you weren't invited to these things?

I wasn't favored but I wasn't disliked, just overlooked like the typical middle child. I have 5 other brothers, and 4 of them still live at home. I have spoken with my youngest and he says that my mom and my SILs mom have gotten super close since their kids got married. The oldest and I didn't get along, for many reasons, but I think that dislike was fed to his wife which was fed to her mom.", "I'm not sure, as I haven't been around them in about 4 years. But before I left, my dad really liked Dean's brother because he would work out with him, which transferred into my dad liking Dean. I knew that my mom always wanted me to marry the neighbor's daughter because we were the same age, but she was never openly hostile toward him before.", "That does seem to be the case, but I'm just wondering who started it.", "I figured he didn't pass his geography class and didn't know that California bordered Mexico since he also didn't invite his aunt or cousin that live near us. Now that I've mentioned them, they weren't invited to dinner either.", ">ve\n\nIt was never clear in the phone call that I was the only one invited. If I had known my husband was being excluded I wouldn't have even thought of going. It wasn't clear he wasn't invited until we got there.", "Due to distance, they say in comments that their family has known their spouse (and his brother) for a long time and never had any issues with either of them.", "You could go low to no contact and get some therapy to work some of this through. The pair of you. Or even the three of you. It isn't okay for your man to be willing to sit through that kind of attack, or not feel like he can set boundaries on conversations (? which is how it sounds). Plus, he grew up with these people? Wtf?  It isn't okay to have your family to cut you out, attack as they did and then demand an apology when you set your own boundary. It all stinks. You might even want to look at the emotional neglect sub, and the raised by narcissists one, and see if anything resonates.", "I would venture a guess as to SIL since your family seemed fine with your husband before.", "Did you edit your post or did I misread it? I thought you said you realized they hadn\u2019t invited Dean and you took him anyway.", "Doesn\u2019t matter.  She still lives far but was invited this year for some reason.", "Checking those subs might be a good idea. Dean and his brother are in therapy. I will think about seeing one myself. Dean is the kind of person who is willing to spoil meals to defend himself, but there were multiple children present.", "I haven't edited it. We learned that he hadn't been invited in the middle of dinner after we traveled across the country to be present. We left partly because she told us that he hadn't been invited, but it was really more so because they were claiming that he was cheating on me with his brother.", "OP is a man. And it does matter, no one said his husband WASN'T invited until after they got there. In most families, when someone is married they are a package deal for holiday visits, unless there is a previous understanding otherwise. \n\nThe idea of confirming that my spouse was included in an invite to family Thanksgiving sounds absolutely insane to me, and I believe that to be true in most families.", "Nothing to lose by scrolling through. I was actually thinking about the original conversation, where they were grilling him about his sex life and other deeply personal matters with zero consideration or care. But if he is already in therapy then hopefully this sort of thing can be worked through there. Still. Astounding that they were willing to raise it all at a table with multiple children present. You sound like you handled a terrible situation in the best way you could, both of you.", "Then I misread the post. My apologies.", "Nah it's alright, I just wanted a full review, if someone thinks ESH then I would like to fully know why but I would be willing to take it, even if it was just one person.
