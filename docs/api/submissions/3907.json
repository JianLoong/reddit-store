We live across the country from my family, so we usually get excluded from family events but my mom invited me this year. I didn\u2019t realize the invitation hadn\u2019t included Dean and brought him with me.\n\nBefore I start, Dean has an \u201cadopted brother\u201d. They found each other as children who needed support and have been inseparable since. His brother and I have gotten very close and I consider him to be my best friend.\n\nWe got the baking supplies Dean needed to bake the various things he would be bringing to the dinner and went to the house. As soon as we arrived, my oldest brother was surprised to see him and even commented on it, which we both brushed off. I was put on babysitting duty over my nieces. I had met the older two once and had never met the youngest but still, I had to babysit them. I did my best to watch over them and play dress up, I make a pretty good fairy princess if I do say so myself. But when we were outside I could see my mom, SIL, and her mom interrogating Dean from the kitchen window. When the girls finally had enough and decided to bother their dad, I went to find Dean who told me about some of the questions he had been asked. Highly personal questions like our sex life, his mental health, and his parent's death. I was disgusted but he told me to drop it and just get through dinner.\n\nI was willing to drop it until his answers were used to put him on blast in front of the entire dinner table. The SILs mom told the dinner table about a disgusting rumor she\u2019d heard about Dean and his brother being incestuous. I told them it wasn\u2019t true but it made my blood boil, but he grabbed my hand and told me to eat. I listened, but they didn\u2019t stop. My mother used his mental health diagnosis as a joke. I was beyond pissed and ignored Dean to ask what their problem with him was. My mom outright told me that she had never invited him and that I had brought him without thinking about how that would make them feel. I demanded they tell me how they feel about my husband, and the SILs mom once again brought up the rumor. My mom nodded and said she didn\u2019t feel comfortable around incest. I once again told her that it had never happened. But she once again said she hadn\u2019t invited Dean. I turned to my dad and asked his opinion but he just shrugged. So I picked up everything Dean had made for the dinner and we left.\n\nDean thinks I did the right thing, and I think I handled the situation to the best of my abilities. But my oldest brother, his wife, her mom, my mom, and my dad think I\u2019m the bad guy and that I need to apologize.\n\nI figured I need an outsider's opinion, so Reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1670135053, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc2hvb/aita_for_bringing_my_husband_to_thanksgiving/", "score": 679, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you have male friends that are straight, you can bet your bottom dollar that your fam are also talking mad shit.

If they are so prejudiced against gay men that they are accusing your spouse of incest, they clearly aren't too far from think that gay men are predatory towards minors/people whom they have authority over. It's the reason that lgbtqia teachers/professors/authority figures/caregivers/bosses/professionals have to take extra steps to ensure that there isn't a whiff of impropriety and be super strict about perception that straight people only mildly have to worry about.
