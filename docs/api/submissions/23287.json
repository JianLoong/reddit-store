Heather should have explained to you herself, instead of putting it on Lauren that way which would of course upset her. Not a good way to meet a parent, especially with an age difference of that size that would reasonably give a parent pause.

I'm only saying that Lauren sucks because it would have been polite for her to (either at the beginning of the dinner or after one of the calls) apologize and explain that she has to take calls as they come in.
