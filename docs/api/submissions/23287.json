Heather should have explained to you herself, instead of putting it on Lauren that way which would of course upset her. Not a good way to meet a parent, especially with an age difference of that size that would reasonably give a parent pause.

Say you'd really like a chance to get to know the girlfriend but that it was hard last time with all the interruptions and that you feel like you started off on the wrong foot. Again not because you did anything wrong but acting like you're on their side will make the daughter more willing to turn to you if something does go wrong in the relationship, whereas if she thinks you're just biased against the gf then she might not come to you.

If there was some work crisis she should have asked to reschedule dinner.  Taking 7+ work calls during dinner, let alone when it's your first meeting with an SO's parent, is just rude and inconsiderate.

I'm only saying that Lauren sucks because it would have been polite for her to (either at the beginning of the dinner or after one of the calls) apologize and explain that she has to take calls as they come in.  But you treated her as if she was your teenager texting at the table.  The way you wrote this honestly sounds like you were dead set against liking Lauren before you even met her, and then just started looking for things to make that happen.

I'm seeing a lot of comments about the age gap from a moral standpoint, which it is a little on the gross side, but there's something to the gap that's more relevant. 20 is not an age I would consider someone to be world-wise enough to truly take care of themselves when dealing with someone more than a decade older than themselves. Especially when that person is a lawyer. They have tricks of the trade they can use against OP's daughter, and that would be a big concern for me as a father. Heather has an upper hand already with her job. Add that she has a decade of knowledge on top of Lauren, and the fact that she has little regard for OP (and I would presume the rest of his family), and I can only think that she is going to use that to entrap Lauren in the relationship. Heather could easily, and most likely legally, make Lauren completely dependent on her. That is my major concern out of this. u/Affectionate-Emu1172, you need to have a sit-down with your daughter without Heather present ASAP.

Being on call and having personal time interrupted is part of the job, but except for the very rare occasion, most legal jobs allow you to step away for an evening meal.

She could have been more gracious and stated there was some emergencies that arose at work and she may need to be in and out for calls.

As an attorney, I\u2019ve had times where it really is an emergency and I have to take a call.  If it\u2019s going to be as bad as the GF claimed, I\u2019ll likely cancel or give my attention to the other person for 30-60 minutes before turning back to the emergency.  It\u2019s something I really try to avoid via good time management and client management.  Even with a true emergency, I\u2019d be mortified and very apologetic.

While the age difference is a bit of a warning sign, please watch your daughter\u2019s behavior to see if it changes suddenly, or if it seems like her girlfriend is attempting to encourage her to isolate herself from other social connections.

Your daughter's obviously got some issues and Heather is older and drawn her into a relationship where your daughter isn't aware that treating others with such disdain and rudeness isn't actually because she's super important and busy; she's just a jerk and likely dating a decade younger because people her age wouldn't put up with her bullshit.", "DNTA, she should have made sure she wasn't interrupted with your very first visit.

Big age gaps are fine when it's like 43 and 34 but your daughter is barely an adult, she's not even finished with college, not financially stable, hasn't had much experience with being an adult so for her to be with someone ELEVEN YEARS older is very concerning to me", "Not even close to the asshole. \n\nI'll put some perspective here. My mother's wife is not only an attorney but a senior partner at her law firm, and SHE has the rule that unless you know prior to dinner happening that you might be expecting an emergency call, you don't take phone calls at the dinner table. Least of all when you're supposed to be making a first impression that should matter to you. It's called respect. They can leave a message, and you can call them back when you're done. \n\nA 31 year old should know that, but what should be expected from a 31 who is dating a 20 year old. Clearly, emotional maturity and social awareness aren't her strong suit. \n\nAlso, \"hotshot\" or no, imposition is still imposition. A genuinely good person will acknowledge when even their high demand job is placing others in a position of social inconvenience. I work in high finance and used to be an on call first responder. If I have to take an important call, or if I used to have to leave on a call, I would still let people know ahead or time if this might come up, and profusely apologize to the people I was leaving to do so. \n\nAgain, it's called respect.

Heather is making sure that everyone knows how important she is. Lauren feels like a grown up for understanding these adult responsibilities. When in reality Heather is acting like a child. If I was having this dinner with Heather, especially a first dinner, it would be my last. Unfortunately, Lauren has on love goggles and again feels very grown up. Heather has the upper hand and is taking complete advantage. I don\u2019t care what her job requires. Unless she\u2019s a surgeon on call she can silence and put away her phone for an hour.
