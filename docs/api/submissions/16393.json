{"id": 16393, "submission_id": "137vaks", "title": "AITAH for not congratulating my BIL on his newborn baby?", "selftext": "I (32 female) and my husband (33 male) found out in May 2022 that we were expecting a baby. We were both excited and nervous because we\u2019ve had 3 previous miscarriages, and didn\u2019t want to get our hopes up. A few weeks later at our ultrasound we found out we were having Mono Di twins. For those that don\u2019t know Mono Di twins mean they each have their own sac, but share a placenta. We were overjoyed when we found out that it was identical twins, and wanted to share the news with both our families. When my husband told his little brother Mike (20), him and his girlfriend started making rude comments to us. Saying that they should be that ones having twins and not us, that we can\u2019t afford two babies and we should give our babies to them. The comments definitely hurt but I decided to brush them off and try not to let it effect me. A few months later my husband and I decided we needed to surround ourselves with a good support system and decided to move back to my home state to be around my family. As much as we loved my husbands home state his family is not close, and ends up causing more drama in our lives. My due date was supposed to be January 9th 2023, but on Aug 24th I started to go into preterm labor. I stayed in the hospital for 6 days on strict bed rest to try and stop labor but unfortunately that didn\u2019t work and I gave birth to twins on Aug 30th. Needless to say we were devastated, and never thought in our wildest dreams our babies would eventually die in our arms just a few short hours after their birth. I was grateful to be surrounded by my family at this time, but unfortunately my husbands family wasn\u2019t there. I figured they would call him or text him to make sure he was okay. Some of them did, but most of his siblings couldn\u2019t even bother to send him a text. We decided to cut off contact with some of his sibling because if they can\u2019t be there for him on the worst day of his life, we don\u2019t need to be there for them. A few months go by and my BIL Mike calls my husband to chew us out. Him and his girlfriend just had a baby and he was so upset that we never called to congratulate them on their little girl. We said of course we wouldn\u2019t call you, y\u2019all weren\u2019t there for us when our children died. He said that we need to get over it, and that our babies didn\u2019t count because they didn\u2019t make it full term and there dead. He said what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t hurting them, but hurting that baby and the family. I understand that it\u2019s not the babies fault but I don\u2019t feel like I can forgive  them for  not being there for my husband. I don\u2019t care that they weren\u2019t there for me, I just feel terrible for my husband. So am I the asshole for not congratulating them, and not wanting to have anything to do with them?", "created_utc": 1683224121, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137vaks/aitah_for_not_congratulating_my_bil_on_his/", "score": 214, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm honestly *wishing* this were a fake post because not only is what happened to you terrible, but it's devastating to think there are people in the world who would treat anyone this way, let alone *family*. Your twins \"don't count\" because they didn't make it to term? You should \"give\" your babies to your BIL and his girlfriend? These people aren't just toxic; they sound extremely cruel. Based on the few statements you relayed from Mike, I think he might have Antisocial Personality Disorder (aka sociopathy). I wouldn't usually engage in armchair psychology on so little evidence, but it's hard to imagine someone who would say those things who *didn't* have some kind of personality disorder. And I feel really bad for his daughter. That's going to be a seriously toxic home to grow up in.\n\nDon't feel bad about not congratulating them. And don't feel bad about being low or no contact with the siblings who didn't provide any support when you lost your twins\u2014especially Mike.\n\nI wish you much love as you heal from your loss.
