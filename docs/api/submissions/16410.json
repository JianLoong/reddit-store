You're an adult, so you are in charge of your own routines. As long as they aren't affecting your parents in anyway they have no right to ask you to change them.", "NTA. If you are not making noise and disturbing anyone, after you turn 18, you officially don't have a \"bedtime.\" You parents may insist that you chip in for expenses or help with chores while you, an adult, are living in their house, but they don't get to tell you what to wear, what to eat, or what time to go to bed. That's some micromanaging, controlling stuff that doesn't affect them at all. Do consider how soon you can move out though.", "NTA Ask them if they had enforced bed times past 18yrs old and watch them think of their life choices", "NTA. My son has not had a bed time since... Maybe middle school? He's in charge of his own schedule because that's what adulthood requires. \n\nStill, I don't know how you can win this one.

They might ask you to move out but if they\u2019re going to be so rigid, it\u2019s probably for the best. You need to become your own person and they clearly don\u2019t want to let you.", "Those are some goofy ass house rules, NGL. Yeah, you\u2019re living in your parents\u2019 house, but you\u2019re an adult, not some little kid in diapers. If that were me, I\u2019d be looking for an apartment. For real.\n\nNTA. Final decision.", "NTA - You\u2019re an adult. They don\u2019t get to enforce bedtimes on you. It\u2019d be weird if they were doing this even when you were 15-16, honestly; at that age, most teens are capable of handling their own bedtimes.\n\nIf they refuse to treat you as an adult and respect your choices, then it might be better for you to live in a dorm on campus.", "NTA! College students need to manage their own time. Classes oftentimes start later. Evening work. Talking to people in different time zones. As long as you are not keeping other people awake by being loud, there should not be an issue.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t need a curfew as long as you\u2019re aware of and acting in accordance with the time. For example, being more quiet in the morning or at night if people are asleep.", "Parents enforcing a sleep time on you is insane. Have you been sleeping in or missing classes or is this behaviour from them completely unprompted? Also what ages are your parents?", "NTA, but I think you should move out.  When they say that they miss you and wish you would move back home, just tell them that you're happy with your current situation because no one demands that you go to bed at a certain time.", "My kids were allowed to make this decision at 16. You are pretty grown people by then. My 14 yo has an 10ish bed time. My 2 grown kids have great jobs, get themselves up for work independently because I let them be independent.", "NTA. Not going to lie, I stopped having a bedtime once I was in middle school. Studying, sports and assignments always kept me up late so every night I\u2019d go to bed at a different time.", "NTA - obviously you\u2019re an adult who is being considerate of how much noise you\u2019re making - you\u2019re in charge of your own bedtime. \n\nEither they\u2019re being excessively controlling in a way that\u2019s super weird, or this is a subtle way to try and nudge you out of the house.", "NTA your way past having a bed time. Info how have you explained your position. Have you sat down and talked maturely. They seem to be having a hard time transitioning with you into adulthood.", "ESH. But if you dont want your families rules. Move out.", "NAH - Crazy rule but, like it or not, it's their house and they get to make the rules.
