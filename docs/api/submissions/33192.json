We have 2 young kids and essentially no familial support. Since the pandemic things have been extremely hard with just the 2 of us working, studying, and raising the kids. Myself and our youngest child especially have suffered several health issues/emergencies the past few years, mine resulting in multiple surgeries. Notably over the last year I have gotten skin rashes/skin infections over and over. I have always had \u201cnice\u201d skin and almost no problems my entire life until this past year. I\u2019ve seen my dermatologist and my primary care physician several times to get treatments (anti-fungal creams, antibiotics, steroid creams) but these issues keep coming back which has caused me severe stress trying to not only fix the issues but wondering if I have a more serious underlying issue causing this.\n\nHusband used to be very talkative but the last few years I feel like he doesn\u2019t communicate with me. No matter how many times I tell him about an appointment for the kids, how to do a certain household task, or essentially anything, he tells me that he doesn\u2019t remember me even showing him or telling him. I know that is a huge red flag for weaponized incompetence but he says that his therapist tells him that it isn\u2019t malicious but that he\u2019s just \u201cburnt out\u201d and dissociating.\n\nSo here\u2019s where I might be TAH: tonight, after our kids went down for bed, I laid into him about our marriage/relationship/household workload. I told him that I felt isolated and lonely. I mentioned that even in the \u201croommate\u201d portion of our marriage- like chores- he only does things part of the way which inevitably causes me to do twice the amount of work.\n\nHe countered back saying that he \u201ccleans the shower almost everyday\u201d. This shocked me as I\u2019ve never heard him use our power scrubber and our hand scrubber is still in the packaging. When I told him this (accusing him essentially of lying) he finished with \u201cI\u2019ve been using your washcloths to clean the shower.\u201d I use washcloths everyday on my face and every other part of my body. \n\nI definitely lost it and was crying/screaming at him and told him to leave the house - which he did. He wants to come home and keeps saying it was a mistake and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know or think about it\u201d and that I\u2019m completely overreacting.

With items he knows are yours/you use? And he knows your skin issues and he works in the medical field so knows all of this is unsanitary?\n\nHis excuse that he isn't using weaponized incompetence is pretty gross too... You can't confirm it and that's also not really how therapy works\n\nAnyway I, if it was an honest mistake why has he specifically been using your washcloth every time and never his own washcloth/towel?", "NTA. If he works in the medical field and doesn\u2019t have basic hygiene sense about not using your washcloths to clean the shower then I\u2019m more concerned about his inability to fulfill his role in his profession than anything else. That and the fact that his idiocy caused you physical and psychological agony. I know how painful and difficult eczema can be. He\u2019s literally causing it with not only all the stress but also with his gross hygiene issues. Gee I wonder what other gross things he\u2019s doing. I dealt with a man who was washed his shoes in the kitchen sink. Shoes worn in a big dirty city. I ended it just for that. I used to keep getting sick. It may seem like negligible habits but it affects your health and I think that\u2019s too much to put up with.", " Nope. Even if you weren't getting unexplained skin rashes, using your washcloths to clean the shower was 100% a passive aggressive act against you. Maybe being tired impaired his judgement or impulse control, but he knew exactly what he was doing every time he did that.\n\nETA: saw the comment about the washcloths going into the hamper after cleaning the shower. Now, it's not so clear. He said he doesn't always use cleaning products, but that doesn't help. Any kind of bathroom cleaner is going to leave harmful chemicals on that fabric, even through a laundry cycle, so he's still the cause of her skin issues.\n\nIt's hard to believe someone in the medical field doesn't understand chemical exposure, but it could just be genuine stupidity. \n\nI'm inclined to still think it's a passive aggressive thing. Especially, since he didn't always do it and didn't say anything or stop after the skin issues started.", "NTA. An adult man should have enough brain cells to know 1)those go on your FACE 2) things don\u2019t get \u201cclean\u201d from one or two swipes from a one dry washcloth.", "The very very first thing that popped in my head for you and your sons health issues is \u201cmold.\u201d Have your house checked for it.", "NTA and I think your husband has a big mental issue. He sees a therapist but I think it\u2019s an excuse to do only what he wants and to excuse his behavior. He tells you what he wants about his therapy. Maybe you could see someone together so he couldn\u2019t lie about conclusions. What adult could use a personal thing to clean a shower and choose specifically his wife one ??", "Oh my god??? Like he\u2019d literally using your washcloths that god knows what it comes in contact with in the shower, that you use on highly sensitive areas, to clean the fucking shower????? Holy shit I am so sorry.", "My ex husband used to empty the bin and leave the bin lid on food prep surfaces and not wash his hands afterwards and when I'd ask him to wash his hands or stop putting dirty bin lids on the food surfaces? Got pissy. That is just one small example.  \n\n\nI later learnt what he was doing is called weaponised incompetence. Deliberately doing things badly, or refusing to do them 'because you do it better' is a form of manipulation and control. I wish I had known earlier and not wasted 11 years.", "NTA\n\n>but he says that his therapist tells him that it isn\u2019t malicious but that he\u2019s just \u201cburnt out\u201d and dissociating.\n\nI have the strong feeling this is a lie.... He's a grown man, not a toddler.\n\n>how burnt out we BOTH are\n\nAnd yet you still manage to act like an adult while he uses his supposed \"burn out\" to give you health issue, load all the family work onto you and then act innocent and grasping for empathy. That's far from okay.", "NTA, he did it on purpose. he knew you were having skin issues and I am going to assume he would be smart enough to put those together. yeah, he is doing this to you on purpose.", "Seeing ur comments.... hes done this before with ur CLOTHES?? AND NOW UR WASH CLOTHS AND U HAVE BAD SKIN INFECTIONS??? Has he ever done this shit with his own clothes and wash cloths?! Wtf is wrong with him. If my boyfriend ever did that I'd rip into him, if my boyfriend ever did that AGAIN AND IT CAUSED ME TO HAVE CHRONIC SKIN PROBLEMS???? oh absolutely not. That is showing how little he cares for u girl. Medical professionals have to do so much with sterilized equipment and sterile clothe guarding, ppe, etc. He knows the risks. Unless he's that stupid to not understand (which, with how little ppl seem to have learned with how germs work after covid, could be true) how spreading germs, bacteria, mold, etc works, he has to be doing this on purpose and was looking for a reason to divorce. This is honestly crazy to me.", "He was doing that shit on purpose, watching you go crazy trying to figure out why your skin is breaking out. I WOULD refuse to take him back until he works a full week of a cleaning service job to prove to you that he\u2019s not going to be a hazard to live with. NTA", "NTA and I am shocked that anyone thinks otherwise. It is thoughtlessly cruel, and the whole \u201cI can\u2019t remember what you said\u201d bit is outright disrespect.", "NTA I doubt he would use his toothbrush to clean things so the fact he used your washcloths to clean the shower among several other things just shows the massive lack of respect he has for you.", "NTA I even if this isn't on purpose (which tbh sounds like it is), he should understand this is an extreme mistake considering your skin issues and may have caused this to begin with.", "Perhaps it is time to attend joint couples counseling.  He might be gaslighting you with his \u201cdissociating\u201d reason for not participating fully in his responsibilities as a father and husband.  Using your face/body washcloth to wipe up the shower, knowing that you\u2019ve suffered in the recent year from repeated dermatological issue, is cruel.", "NTA and I would recommend talking to his therapist, not in a professional capacity, but rather to inform them of what the therapist\u2019s words are being used as. Let the therapist know how their words are being misconstrued to harm you, his wife. Explain it all in detail, how you never get any help, how everything falls on you, how you end up doing so much more than your husband, and how your husband has been spitefully using your own health to punish you.\n\nBecause that is what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s in the medical sector; he KNOWS this is wrong, and he\u2019s SEEN you suffering for a year with the stress of your skin condition. Even if he\u2019s not really consciously DECIDING to punish you, I guarantee there is a little part of him that is getting off on him \u201chelping out\u201d by using your own personal hygiene products.\n\nHow would he react if you scrubbed the mould out from the shower with his toothbrush? Or used his towel to clean the bathroom floor? He\u2019d be grossed out. He KNOWS this is wrong but wants to believe you\u2019re overreacting, because the alternative is he\u2019s been abusing you and neglecting you.", "Hi, jumping in b/c of the skin aspect (btw I agree you\u2019re NTA), but wanted to say (w/o knowing too much about your condition) have you seen an immunologist? I have a family member who suffered from skin issues for years & kept seeing a dermatologist but it ended up being an autoimmune disease (in their case lupus).  It may be worth exploring as stress, sun exposure, and certain foods often trigger the skin with what looks like rashes or acne. Anyway, I hope your condition gets better regardless and that you can sort your husband out.", "NTA. I cannot believe it was accidental. But if it was...then he's got a different problem.", "Why rhe fuck is he using your wash cloths to clean???? NTA", "NTA, cleaning cloths and face cloths are kept separate for a reason. Not to mention not using cleaning solution while \u201ccleaning\u201d the shower? All he\u2019s doing is spreading nastiness. \n\nHe does not know how to clean at all, or he does not want to learn. This is pure weaponize incompetence. How can he not know? \nAt least he knows he wrong, which is a good sign. I think he needs someone who is not you (that you trust), to show him how to clean, join some online cleaning groups, and read some books on cleaning. *shudder*", "NTA whether it was him being overwhelmed or him being passive aggressive doesn\u2019t matter.  Clearly he is not making his life partner a priority by using her washcloth to clean the shower. Of all the things he could use, why that?  Again and again and again?", "Omg, NTA. He\u2019s been making you sick? On purpose. There is no way anyone with even a quarter of a brain would a) use their loved ones face cloths to clean a bathroom b) wouldn\u2019t use cleaning product in a bathroom c) watch their loved one have a terrible unknown reaction and think it wasn\u2019t related. He is totally incompetent as an adult and I would absolutely not leave myself shackled to an complete moron for life", "> his therapist tells him that it isn\u2019t malicious\n\nAre you sure about this? Because it definitely sounds malicious. NTA. At this point, it looks like your life would be way easier without your husband in it.", "NTA.\n\nI have struggled with neurodermatitis for half my life. So I know really well, what it means to have to watch out, what I'm putting on my skin, how long I can soak, etc.\n\nNEVER in my life I thought of using a washcloth to clean the bathroom! \ud83e\udd2f And as far as I know, none of my previous partners or my hubs did. Like, eww.\n\nYour husband and you seem both to be really distressed, but it's no excuse for using the others personal hygiene items to \"clean\" the shower.\n\nI don't know, if you guys can afford it, but maybe a cleaning help could be the answer. I am partly disabled, my hubs is working 6 days a week and to be fair... I hate cleaning.\n\nSo we have a really nice lady (who is more or less a family friend by now) coming 2 times a week to wash the floors and clean the bathrooms. It's really taking a big burden from our shoulders.", "NTA, he clearly did it on purpose.", "Some people are just inherently gormless. My mam\u2019s ex was like that. He\u2019d do things with the best intentions but always do everything so badly that it seemed like he was doing it on purpose, or for a laugh, which he wasn\u2019t.\n\nI know stress can cause rashes and skin problems. At my old place of work, I hated it so much that I\u2019d get head to foot rashes whenever I went in.\n\nMaybe you just aren\u2019t compatible as a couple and should think whether you want to be with him for the rest of your life.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. This dude is definitely the asshole. It's not as bad as using your toothbrush to clean the toilet but I wouldn't be surprised if he did. You should probably leave.", "NTA\u2026.Eewe! Like wtf! It\u2019s like using a dish cloth on the floor!", "WTF I just read", "NTA whether it was him being overwhelmed or him being passive aggressive doesn\u2019t matter.

Again and again and again?", "NTA who's washclothes did he think they were?  Who else did he think was using them for anything else but showering? I think you have your answer he was being an AH. Some people typically do this kind of stuff purposely, so the other person will do it because they've proven they aren't capable. He needs to act like an Adult.", "NTA. Some men need to be stopped getting coddled over their weaponized incompetence. But you both need to learn effective communication. I get needing space after an argument but you could have made clear to him that you feel angry and that you need space.", "leave him girl. he doesn't care about you", "Didn't the facecloths smell like bathroom cleaner?", "Nta and I don't accept the poor excuse of being burnt out that he used your wash cloth to clean the shower.", "NTA.  The lack of communication and listening from him are indicative of some bigger issues that you need to work on.  That aside, using a wash cloth to clean the shower and not putting it in the laundry is sheer incompetence, especially for someone in the medical field.  You have every right to be upset.  \n\nThat being said, kicking him out of the house is a bit extreme.  Let him come home and discuss things with him.  It sounds like you both have busy lives, but if you are going to be together, you need to communicate and coordinate.  He needs to listen better and think through his actions.", "NTA. Enough internet for today. And qI've been awake for less than an hour", "Wtaf?? NTA", "NTA, he knew exactly what he\u2019s doing", "NTA\nYou can be burnt out and not be an idiot.  He doesn't care about you.", "I bet your days for however many days he's gone are going to be some of the most blissful and freeing days of your life", "He\u2019s taking no interest in your issues and being selfish. Ewww break it off", "Maybe he is not in a good place right now, but that doesn\u2019t excuse making dumb choices and the not knowing about things you\u2019ve told him of.\n\nI have always been terrible with dates - if my wife asks me to do a thing on the 18th, I will agree and then it never comes back up in my brain that I need to do that thing. I spent years thinking I was just broken somehow, until I decided to compensate for it. I now ruthlessly organise my commitments in my phone\u2019s calendar, with reminder alerts ahead of the things I\u2019m supposed to do. As a result I now don\u2019t forget things and I\u2019m much more reliable than I used to be.\n\nHe might benefit from doing something similar.", "Diabolical act of sabotage, this isn\u2019t normal.", "So . . . the obvious question. What\u2019s he been cleaning with your toothbrush?!", "NTA, but your husband must change the therapist if you want to stay married. Otherwise you're the one who's gonna burn out simply because he really takes you for granted.\nHow can this person be burnt out for so long and the therapist just tells him \"that's ok you're burnt out\"? It doesn't make sense! When my therapist noticed I was going down this hill, she asked me to go see a shrink and start taking some meds. That's what I did and thank God! Otherwise I wouldn't be able to finish what I'm doing.\n\nIn my opinion there are two main issues here: the bad therapist and your husband taking you for granted. If he really is incapable of doing the bare minimum, it's because he knows you're there and you're gonna do it. If he takes your loofah to \"clean the showers almost everyday\" (he ain't cleaning, just keeping your loofah full of everybody's dead cells and dirt, yikes!), have you stopped to think about how he feels about you? This person is in the medical field and doesn't seem to care if he lives in filth or if you are burnt out. He doesn't seem to care even for the kids. I mean, he is not even cleaning the shower properly! He doesn't mind fungus? Mycosis? I mean... He could be burnt out? Of course! But he really needs to change therapists. The one he's seeing now is not really doing anything for him.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's important to approach these conversations with a willingness to listen and work together toward a healthier relationship.

Though I am white myself and have always used a washcloth.", "Random redditor proclaiming something does not make it fact. Please tell me you are aware of this simple fact.\n\nAnd again. If there actually ARE mold and pathogens in her home that aren't killed by washing and drying. The facecloths being used IS NOT THE ISSUE.", "Mate you\u2019re making a lot of assumptions here. About me. About my intentions. About OPs husband. About their everyday lives. About their interactions. It\u2019s honestly a little alarming all the conclusions you\u2019re drawing from what little information you\u2019ve been given.  \n\nI never said those terms are exclusive to the ND community. I said they were often used by people in the ND community.\n\nI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see eye to eye on this. You seem to have formulated an opinion on who I am as a person based on my original reply and are responding with a level of vitriol I\u2019m not accustomed to dealing with. I think it best we agree to disagree.  I wish you the best!", "it's so clear that this is malicious. You can't dissociate so hard you never hear anything your wife says but only ever choose to use your wife's things to clean a gross bathroom. He spent a year doing serious medical damage to his wife. I hope your skin condition clears up after using new washcloths NTA", "I agree with the other commenter who said he\u2019s being consciously doing this by being passive aggressive and using only your stuff. you didn\u2019t catch him for the first 5 years because he was hiding it from you, knowing that it\u2019s completely unsanitary, invasive and wrong. I would bet so much money that he\u2019s been doing this all along. by this I mean using your stuff in general as household cleaning items. that\u2019s disgusting and I would be pissed off. why doesn\u2019t he use his dirty shirts or washcloths??!! because HE KNOWS AND HE DOESN\u2019T CARE. personally, doing stuff like this would be a dealbreaker for me. it\u2019s so so disrespectful.", "Hmmmmm so *his* dirty used clothes and towels are above being used for cleaning the bathroom.  But *your* used clothes and towels are fair game.\n\nFunny that he has never made this \"mistake\" with his own possessions.\n\nIf you hadn't caught him using your laundry to clean the bathroom, what would have stopped him?", "Your husband is a fucking psychopath. It's intentional and disrespectful to the point of being totally malicious.\n\nSeriously, I wonder how many other ways your life would improve if you broke up. How many other things are there where you have no idea that he is secretly causing things that are going badly for you?", "Oh. He\u2019s using your things on purpose.", "Bingo. If only your stuff that you wear is good for cleaning the bathroom and his isn\u2019t, that\u2019s not only gross, but a deal breaker. He can\u2019t be bothered to get the designated cleaning cloths? This is exactly like using someone\u2019s toothbrush to clean the toilet. Not an over reaction at all.", "Run And leave before he accidentally poisons and kills you. Cuz no way he is doing that accidentally. You caught him using your shirts. He isn't worth it. Run", "Read \u201c why does he do that\u201d by Lundy Bancroft,\nThis behaviour is common among certain types of men, one guy in the book would go into rages and smash the things all over the house and claim he was \u201c out of control \u201c and couldn\u2019t help himself when he got into these rages.\nUpon further investigation they found he never smashed any of his own things, only his wife\u2019s things were destroyed", "You\u2019re not overreacting. It\u2019s not about the shirts or the washcloths or the cleaning or him being burned out and tired. It\u2019s about him not caring how his actions affect you, his wife and the mother of his kids. The person he\u2019s supposed to care about more than anyone else. Even if the problems you\u2019re having with your skin are totally unrelated to the washcloths being used to clean, his actions are saying he feels some type of way and it\u2019s not good.", "This makes me so mad for you! I'd be tempted to clean the toilet with bleach and his dirty clothes. Make that throne shine!", "Wow. And a fucking racist. You\u2019re sure winning at life, dude."]}
