I have some resentment. \n\nOut of frustration I told my mom that I wish I could move out and she asked why and I told her because of dad.

Of course not. Especially if he was abusive. You have no obligation to live with him either way.\n\nIf your mom needs to hear something that might help her cope with your decision to leave, tell her he did not work hard to give you a good life only to ruin it with something beyond his control and make you miserable.", "I mean, NTA for wanting to move out. It\u2019s your life, and I assume you\u2019re old enough to live on your own and live it the way you want. I know culturally your family may expect you to stay at home, but you\u2019re an adult and you\u2019re not TA for wanting to live like one.\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to have resentment for violence in your childhood. Maybe not so much the mental illness and yelling, unless he refuses to be medicated and get counseling.", "NTA, it's okay to want to live your life. Go, be free. Keep in mind that the recommendations here come through western lens where there's less importance on the elderly respect and gratitude for parents etc. Middle eastern culture is a bit different.", "NAH. \n\nAssuming your father has an awful PTSD, I can also understand how mental illnesses affect the environment. He might not be responsible of his behaviour during your childhood either, but one should not neglect the effect this may have exerted in you. People around severely ill people (specially children) usually need support, too, and imo they\u2019re not to blame if they also cry for help, or need their own safe space.", "NTA. It sounds like your father has a psychosis. Is he in any treatment? \nIn germany, if he is a threat to himself or others, basic treatment can be enforced.\n\nThis is not a way to live. Under these conditions, your mental heakth will decline. Move out.", "NAH\n\nNot your dads fault he\u2019s traumatized, not your fault that you don\u2019t wanna life in a house with a Person who\u2019s constantly screaming.", "YTA.  Your father clearly has a pretty severe trauma-related mental health issues.  You may not have seen all of the hard work he did to try to get better and be there for his family, but that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t.  You think he breaks dishes and screams at ghosts because that makes him happy?  Of course not.  He\u2019s suffering far more than you can imagine.  I have no doubt that it was tough growing up with that, but when you become an adult it\u2019s time to stop viewing the entire world as it revolves around you, and start extending the kind of caring and compassion toward others that you want others to extend toward you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not being able to sleep, socialize, or just even relax in your own home is not a healthy environment to stay in.
