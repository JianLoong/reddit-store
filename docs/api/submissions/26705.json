Of course not. Especially if he was abusive. You have no obligation to live with him either way.\n\nIf your mom needs to hear something that might help her cope with your decision to leave, tell her he did not work hard to give you a good life only to ruin it with something beyond his control and make you miserable.", "I mean, NTA for wanting to move out. It\u2019s your life, and I assume you\u2019re old enough to live on your own and live it the way you want. I know culturally your family may expect you to stay at home, but you\u2019re an adult and you\u2019re not TA for wanting to live like one.\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to have resentment for violence in your childhood. Maybe not so much the mental illness and yelling, unless he refuses to be medicated and get counseling.", "NTA, it's okay to want to live your life. Go, be free. Keep in mind that the recommendations here come through western lens where there's less importance on the elderly respect and gratitude for parents etc. Middle eastern culture is a bit different.", "NAH. \n\nAssuming your father has an awful PTSD, I can also understand how mental illnesses affect the environment. He might not be responsible of his behaviour during your childhood either, but one should not neglect the effect this may have exerted in you. People around severely ill people (specially children) usually need support, too, and imo they\u2019re not to blame if they also cry for help, or need their own safe space.", "NTA. It sounds like your father has a psychosis. Is he in any treatment? \nIn germany, if he is a threat to himself or others, basic treatment can be enforced.\n\nThis is not a way to live. Under these conditions, your mental heakth will decline. Move out.", "NAH\n\nNot your dads fault he\u2019s traumatized, not your fault that you don\u2019t wanna life in a house with a Person who\u2019s constantly screaming.", "YTA.  Your father clearly has a pretty severe trauma-related mental health issues.  You may not have seen all of the hard work he did to try to get better and be there for his family, but that doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t.  You think he breaks dishes and screams at ghosts because that makes him happy?  Of course not.  He\u2019s suffering far more than you can imagine.  I have no doubt that it was tough growing up with that, but when you become an adult it\u2019s time to stop viewing the entire world as it revolves around you, and start extending the kind of caring and compassion toward others that you want others to extend toward you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not being able to sleep, socialize, or just even relax in your own home is not a healthy environment to stay in. I know you mentioned that therapy is frowned upon in your culture, but would recreational drug use be something that he could try to maybe calm him down throughout the day? Your father definitely needs help, and it's not healthy for him or the others around him to continue with the way things are.", "You're dad sounds like he has untreated PTSD. He needs help but that help doesn't include you sacrificing  your life for his. Your mom needs help too. Would either of them consider therapy? You're NTA.", "NTA, especially if he was abusive. You're under no obligation to continue living with him, regardless of the circumstances.", "In our culture, therapy isn\u2019t something that is seen positively. He would never consider it.", "Her dad needs to get help. It is not on his child to help him. \n\nI have severe mentally illnesses and have done shit I am not proud of.

I hear what you\u2019re saying and understand.\nI think moving out would be a good step for you to get some space and peace.", "Likely he has PTSD if that\u2019s the case, otherwise would be more inclined towards schizophrenia. Considering how bad it seems he would need some intense psychiatric help.\n\nSadly if he refuses to get help (you said in a comment he would never consider therapy), and was abusive to you and your family to boot, I don\u2019t see why you would NOT want to leave.

Go live it!!!", "You are NTA for wanting a peaceful life.  \n\nYour father is a damaged soul that sounds like has some severe PTSD. He really seems like he needs some professional help.

Ignoring the problem will not make it go away.", "Your dad sounds like he has a terrible form of PTSD, but I\u2019m no mental health care professional. His childhood has clearly affected his adult life. Doesn\u2019t mean your feelings aren\u2019t important or wrong, you have every right to want to move out. His mental health has negatively impacted you. And you can\u2019t blame your mom for feeling the way she does, she probably knows much more about what your father lived through when he was young in Iraq. So she has more sympathy for him. Try to find some positives, but know you are not in the wrong. Just maybe don\u2019t tell your mom?

At the end of the day it doesn't matter whether your dad was a good husband or father, or whether his mental illness comes from trauma. The fact is that it is destroying your life and you need to distance yourself to protect your *own* mental health.", "NTA. Living with your dad sounds extremely stressful. Even if he can't help it, it's very hard on you.", "I was raised with the idea that how you treat your parents will be how your children treat you. I have tried to put myself in my fathers shoes, and although it would shatter me, but I would make my child distance themselves if I ever was diagnosed with an illness that impact their life. I would also, in that scenario, seek therapy and medications. My parents are against the two. \n\nMy sister who is 16 is also affected by this, but it doesn\u2019t strike them as abnormal to live in a house with someone constantly screaming. We have normalized it and that scares me. \n\nI do not know what it\u2019s like to sleep for 8 hours without any interruption.", "Yep. NTA. Tough situation, but not your fault at all.", "That\u2019s his problem to deal with and your mother to support. This is her cross to bear. Not yours.", "Damn, it's really sad he's rather scream all day then try to get help ): NTA OP.", "hugs to you.\n\nmaybe you can sit your mom down and talk about historical ptsd diagnoses. that there is no shame in getting help. \nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/ptsd-may-old-combat/", "Exactly this."]}
