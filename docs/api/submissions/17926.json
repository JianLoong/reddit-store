{"id": 17926, "submission_id": "13ozi25", "title": "AITA for expecting to be invited to the wedding?", "selftext": "I had a friend from a previous job get engaged and asked me for a favor. I left that previous job to work at an upscale hotel. She asked me to get her and her bridesmaids discounted hotel rooms. I was able to swing about 10 suites for a very decent price compared to what they would normally sell for. Now her and I weren\u2019t as close since I left the previous job we both worked at but we would text frequently, just couldn\u2019t see each other due to conflicting work schedules. Timeline was honestly pretty rushed, she was engaged and was soon to get married less than 2 months later. The whole thing was expedited since her fianc\u00e9 was in the military and soon to be on deployment. The way she said it is she couldn\u2019t accompany him unless they were married. \n\nHer and I are talking and I had asked what the theme was for the wedding so I knew what to wear. She awkwardly said I wasn\u2019t invited. I was surprised I wasn\u2019t invited out of at least courtesy for doing her a favor with the wedding block. She said she just couldn\u2019t afford to include anyone else. It wasn\u2019t a small venue either. Her invite list alone, not including the grooms, was over one hundred, varying from close family, friends, and very distant relatives. \n\nI let her know I didn\u2019t understand since it was such a large, lavish event how she couldn\u2019t squeeze one more person. She said it was impossible and they were at the top of their budget. I said if that was the case then they would need to find other accommodations for their wedding as I was giving them an extreme discounted rate due to our friendship. Now the bridesmaids are calling me the asshole for cancelling their rooms. AITA?\n\nTL,DR: I cancelled my friend\u2019s wedding block since I wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nEdit 1: I appreciate all the comments and I can see clearly with the ESH assessment. I want to clarify that if this was a small ceremony with just close family and friends I wouldn\u2019t have been as hurt. We haven\u2019t been as close as we used to so I wouldn\u2019t have disagreed. The matter of hand though is when it comes to inviting a hundred people, that I wasn\u2019t even considered on the list seems disrespectful.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m the general manager of the property, my boss is the owner of many other properties. As long as we exceed our projected revenue for the month then all is well. The rate I was offering was not a standard group rate but significantly lower. About $100 a night for the suites.\n\nEdit 3: After the blow out, I heard from one of my old coworkers that was invited to the wedding that before everything went sideways, the bride was bragging on how much money she was saving with my discount and how it can be put into more expensive decorating, flowers, ect. So not inviting me because of budgeting seemed like a poor excuse after the fact.", "created_utc": 1684781337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ozi25/aita_for_expecting_to_be_invited_to_the_wedding/", "score": 2798, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like you shouldn't have assumed you were invited, but I understand why you did. Her wanting that favor but not inviting you is craazzyyy lol the nerve. Glad you took back your favor.", "NTA Made me laugh.  Where as I think it is incredibly rude to inquire as to an invite, the bride had a huge nerve to ask that big of a favor with zero to offer in return.  Karma.  Bride was rude and got some rude back.  You got some balls girl.", "NTA! She used you and used you good!! I know how low you probably were able to drop those rooms. Expedited  my ass!! She was hopping to skate right up to the wedding date with very little communication with you as that\u2019s how it seems to have been progressing. She really must think you\u2019re a dumb ass to try and use the excuse of over budget when YOUR the one who just saved her a HUGE chunk of change on the motel budget!! Yeah, some friend!", "I'm going with NTA. You did her a huge favor and she should be appreciative. I guess you were the only one that thought you two were friends.", "NTA. She can't have it both ways, if you're important enough to ask for a big favor like that, then you're important enough to warrant an invite. The nerve of that woman.", "INFO\n\nPlease elaborate on \"a very decent price compared to what they would normally sell for\".  Don't hotels commonly discount for groups, friend or no friend?\n\nAlso, how long ago did you work with her?  You say you guys weren't as close anymore.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d also suggest splitting the relationship with this \u201cfriend\u201d, I\u2019d bet my left leg that she was just using you and doesn\u2019t see you as such.", "NTA - Play stupid games, get stupid prizes.  \n\nNo one should be asking someone that isn't even invited to the wedding for such a huge favor.  She could have used her own discount at the hotel she works at, instead she asked you because you had moved up to a much fancier place.  Even asking you for the favor was an implied invitation, and you should have been invited at that point whether or not you were able to get the discount she wanted.\n\nThe people that are calling you out are laughable.  They're acting like being invited to the wedding is some huge benefit to you.  It's not.  You don't get anything for going to a wedding, in fact the only benefit of doing such a big favor is usually that the bride considers that your present instead of expecting you to buy something as well.\n\nBut not inviting you was a slap in the face.  Pointing out that you're not even in her top hundred people (and the groom's side likely has as many people, so the wedding is already over 200) is rude as hell.  I know the price point those suites were likely at, and you saved her thousands to get discounts on 10 suites with very little notice.\n\nShe showed you that you aren't a friend, just a contact she thought she could use and then ignore.  I'd suggest breaking contact with her, and the next time someone asks you for a \"favor\" make sure you know exactly what the situation is and whether or not you're invited to the event before you answer.", "NTA you did a favor for who you thought was a friend - they turned out not to be your friend. Favor rescinded. Honestly, it doesn\u2019t even matter if you ARE TA, it\u2019s your prerogative to not do favors for people who have hurt your feelings.", "NTA.  She was using you and you called her on it.  Not your friend.  She should have left room for a few people like this in her invites as one normally does for a wedding for a) friends and b) especially friends that help with wedding related activities of which using your position at a fancier hotel was.", "ESH. It's incredibly tacky of her to ask for a considerable favor for her wedding and not invite you at least to the reception. \n\nHowever, you shouldn't have assumed you were invited. And it seems she never gave you even a verbal invite. You basically invited yourself to her wedding and that's also very tacky. Holding the favor you did over her head and further canceling the rooms upon learning you were not invited was an escalation and an asshole move. You were clearly not doing something out of kindness \"due to your friendship\", you were doing something and expecting a benefit in return.", "ESH, she clearly was just using you to get discounted rooms, which is fucked up. You never got invited, you just assumed you were going. And canceled the rooms when you found out you weren't, which is also fucked up.", "Why are you so desperate to go? I could see being a little hurt, but someone asked you to do a favor and you chose to do it, and it was no expense for you. The room cancelling after insisting she can squeeze one more person is weird. It's weird you asked about theme when you hadn't gotten an invitation. Would have been N A H for feeling hurt but YTA for the revenge cancellation retaliation.", "NTA. If someone would do me a huge favour regarding to my wedding, a favour I have asked for...I would feel completely shallow not inviting them.", "YTA - who cares who else was invited? You barely know this person, you aren\u2019t her friend, you aren\u2019t her family.

She reached out to you b/c you WORK AT A HOTEL.  This is not a wild favor to ask someone you are acquainted with, and is super presumptuous on your part to think anything beyond WHAT SHE ASKED.\n\nIs your boss aware you cancelled a wedding block?  WOOOOO.  You didn't give them that rate, either. You don't own the hotel.", "Riiiiight up until the end you had it, and then you decided to be TA by delivering the rug pull. So ESH: her for abusing your hospitality, and you for adding conditions to said hospitality after the fact. You had the chance to be the bigger person and tossed it.\n\nOf course, your employer might also question your assignment of rates based on your personal feelings about the customer either for good or ill.\n\nEDIT: with additional context from OP, I'd go NTA. Still not exactly magnanimous, but with the bride clearly being not merely oblivious and entitled but proudly manipulative, and OP having been both more generous and more within their rights to hand out discounts than was originally apparent, the calculus changes.", "Yes YTA. You assumed you were invited and then attempted to guilt your way into an invite by holding the discount over her head.\n\nYou're choosing to be an AH. I suggest choosing to be a decent person and give her the discount if you're able. Taking that away over an invite is so childish. I wouldn't ever talk to you again if I was her. How ridiculous.", "YTA. You can be disappointed to not be invited but cancelling their accommodation is petty and hurts the bridesmaids you've never met. Have you had a wedding? The guest list balloons out of control quickly because if you invite the one cousin you like, you've then got to invite their siblings, spouses, kids, etc. It can be really hard to fit in one more person, frankly. \n\nThere are lots of ways to pay you back for doing her a favor other than an invitation to the wedding. Now you'll never know how she'd have reciprocated.", "YTA\n\nYou gave them a price and pulled a very petty move.  So what if you weren't invited?  It's not like you own the hotel and the discount was coming out of your pocket.  \n\nAnyone who has been married knows how tough managing the guest list is and how expensive it is.  It's not just \"invite 1 more person\".  It's invite this person I know from work, but then my fiance needs to invite a couple more people because they'll feel left out.\n\nWhy anyone would want to go to a wedding is quite beyond me.", "YTA.  I guarantee parents are paying for this lavish wedding and probably had more say in the guestlist than the bride and groom.  Your friend asked for a favor and a true friend would've said yes with NSA.  That's not what happened here. You sound entitled, petty, vindictive and spiteful.  Why would anybody want someone like that at their wedding.  If the bride had said I don't want you there then by all means cancel the rooms. I understand why you would feel hurt but seriously grow up.", "She\u2019s petty and you by pulling the rooms are worse.", "ESH, she could have at least offered but you didn't have to turn around and be petty.", "You didn't have to cancel the rooms.
