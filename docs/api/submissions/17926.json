{"id": 17926, "submission_id": "13ozi25", "title": "AITA for expecting to be invited to the wedding?", "selftext": "I had a friend from a previous job get engaged and asked me for a favor. I left that previous job to work at an upscale hotel. She asked me to get her and her bridesmaids discounted hotel rooms. I was able to swing about 10 suites for a very decent price compared to what they would normally sell for. Now her and I weren\u2019t as close since I left the previous job we both worked at but we would text frequently, just couldn\u2019t see each other due to conflicting work schedules. Timeline was honestly pretty rushed, she was engaged and was soon to get married less than 2 months later. The whole thing was expedited since her fianc\u00e9 was in the military and soon to be on deployment. The way she said it is she couldn\u2019t accompany him unless they were married. \n\nHer and I are talking and I had asked what the theme was for the wedding so I knew what to wear. She awkwardly said I wasn\u2019t invited. I was surprised I wasn\u2019t invited out of at least courtesy for doing her a favor with the wedding block. She said she just couldn\u2019t afford to include anyone else. It wasn\u2019t a small venue either. Her invite list alone, not including the grooms, was over one hundred, varying from close family, friends, and very distant relatives. \n\nI let her know I didn\u2019t understand since it was such a large, lavish event how she couldn\u2019t squeeze one more person. She said it was impossible and they were at the top of their budget. I said if that was the case then they would need to find other accommodations for their wedding as I was giving them an extreme discounted rate due to our friendship. Now the bridesmaids are calling me the asshole for cancelling their rooms. AITA?\n\nTL,DR: I cancelled my friend\u2019s wedding block since I wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nEdit 1: I appreciate all the comments and I can see clearly with the ESH assessment. I want to clarify that if this was a small ceremony with just close family and friends I wouldn\u2019t have been as hurt. We haven\u2019t been as close as we used to so I wouldn\u2019t have disagreed. The matter of hand though is when it comes to inviting a hundred people, that I wasn\u2019t even considered on the list seems disrespectful.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m the general manager of the property, my boss is the owner of many other properties. As long as we exceed our projected revenue for the month then all is well. The rate I was offering was not a standard group rate but significantly lower. About $100 a night for the suites.\n\nEdit 3: After the blow out, I heard from one of my old coworkers that was invited to the wedding that before everything went sideways, the bride was bragging on how much money she was saving with my discount and how it can be put into more expensive decorating, flowers, ect. So not inviting me because of budgeting seemed like a poor excuse after the fact.", "created_utc": 1684781337, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ozi25/aita_for_expecting_to_be_invited_to_the_wedding/", "score": 488, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel like you shouldn't have assumed you were invited, but I understand why you did. Her wanting that favor but not inviting you is craazzyyy lol the nerve. Glad you took back your favor.", "NTA Made me laugh.  Where as I think it is incredibly rude to inquire as to an invite, the bride had a huge nerve to ask that big of a favor with zero to offer in return.  Karma.  Bride was rude and got some rude back.  You got some balls girl.", "NTA! She used you and used you good!! I know how low you probably were able to drop those rooms. Expedited  my ass!! She was hopping to skate right up to the wedding date with very little communication with you as that\u2019s how it seems to have been progressing. She really must think you\u2019re a dumb ass to try and use the excuse of over budget when YOUR the one who just saved her a HUGE chunk of change on the motel budget!! Yeah, some friend!", "I'm going with NTA. You did her a huge favor and she should be appreciative. I guess you were the only one that thought you two were friends.", "NTA. She can't have it both ways, if you're important enough to ask for a big favor like that, then you're important enough to warrant an invite. The nerve of that woman.", "INFO\n\nPlease elaborate on \"a very decent price compared to what they would normally sell for\".  Don't hotels commonly discount for groups, friend or no friend?\n\nAlso, how long ago did you work with her?  You say you guys weren't as close anymore.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d also suggest splitting the relationship with this \u201cfriend\u201d, I\u2019d bet my left leg that she was just using you and doesn\u2019t see you as such.", "NTA - Play stupid games, get stupid prizes.  \n\nNo one should be asking someone that isn't even invited to the wedding for such a huge favor.  She could have used her own discount at the hotel she works at, instead she asked you because you had moved up to a much fancier place.  Even asking you for the favor was an implied invitation, and you should have been invited at that point whether or not you were able to get the discount she wanted.\n\nThe people that are calling you out are laughable.  They're acting like being invited to the wedding is some huge benefit to you.  It's not.  You don't get anything for going to a wedding, in fact the only benefit of doing such a big favor is usually that the bride considers that your present instead of expecting you to buy something as well.\n\nBut not inviting you was a slap in the face.  Pointing out that you're not even in her top hundred people (and the groom's side likely has as many people, so the wedding is already over 200) is rude as hell.  I know the price point those suites were likely at, and you saved her thousands to get discounts on 10 suites with very little notice.\n\nShe showed you that you aren't a friend, just a contact she thought she could use and then ignore.  I'd suggest breaking contact with her, and the next time someone asks you for a \"favor\" make sure you know exactly what the situation is and whether or not you're invited to the event before you answer.", "NTA you did a favor for who you thought was a friend - they turned out not to be your friend. Favor rescinded. Honestly, it doesn\u2019t even matter if you ARE TA, it\u2019s your prerogative to not do favors for people who have hurt your feelings.", "NTA.  She was using you and you called her on it.  Not your friend.  She should have left room for a few people like this in her invites as one normally does for a wedding for a) friends and b) especially friends that help with wedding related activities of which using your position at a fancier hotel was.", "ESH. It's incredibly tacky of her to ask for a considerable favor for her wedding and not invite you at least to the reception. \n\nHowever, you shouldn't have assumed you were invited. And it seems she never gave you even a verbal invite. You basically invited yourself to her wedding and that's also very tacky. Holding the favor you did over her head and further canceling the rooms upon learning you were not invited was an escalation and an asshole move. You were clearly not doing something out of kindness \"due to your friendship\", you were doing something and expecting a benefit in return.", "ESH, she clearly was just using you to get discounted rooms, which is fucked up. You never got invited, you just assumed you were going. And canceled the rooms when you found out you weren't, which is also fucked up.", "Why are you so desperate to go? I could see being a little hurt, but someone asked you to do a favor and you chose to do it, and it was no expense for you. The room cancelling after insisting she can squeeze one more person is weird. It's weird you asked about theme when you hadn't gotten an invitation. Would have been N A H for feeling hurt but YTA for the revenge cancellation retaliation.", "NTA. If someone would do me a huge favour regarding to my wedding, a favour I have asked for...I would feel completely shallow not inviting them.", "YTA - who cares who else was invited? You barely know this person, you aren\u2019t her friend, you aren\u2019t her family.

She reached out to you b/c you WORK AT A HOTEL.  This is not a wild favor to ask someone you are acquainted with, and is super presumptuous on your part to think anything beyond WHAT SHE ASKED.\n\nIs your boss aware you cancelled a wedding block?  WOOOOO.  You didn't give them that rate, either. You don't own the hotel.", "Riiiiight up until the end you had it, and then you decided to be TA by delivering the rug pull. So ESH: her for abusing your hospitality, and you for adding conditions to said hospitality after the fact. You had the chance to be the bigger person and tossed it.\n\nOf course, your employer might also question your assignment of rates based on your personal feelings about the customer either for good or ill.\n\nEDIT: with additional context from OP, I'd go NTA. Still not exactly magnanimous, but with the bride clearly being not merely oblivious and entitled but proudly manipulative, and OP having been both more generous and more within their rights to hand out discounts than was originally apparent, the calculus changes.", "Yes YTA. You assumed you were invited and then attempted to guilt your way into an invite by holding the discount over her head.\n\nYou're choosing to be an AH. I suggest choosing to be a decent person and give her the discount if you're able. Taking that away over an invite is so childish. I wouldn't ever talk to you again if I was her. How ridiculous.", "YTA. You can be disappointed to not be invited but cancelling their accommodation is petty and hurts the bridesmaids you've never met. Have you had a wedding? The guest list balloons out of control quickly because if you invite the one cousin you like, you've then got to invite their siblings, spouses, kids, etc. It can be really hard to fit in one more person, frankly. \n\nThere are lots of ways to pay you back for doing her a favor other than an invitation to the wedding. Now you'll never know how she'd have reciprocated.", "YTA\n\nYou gave them a price and pulled a very petty move.  So what if you weren't invited?  It's not like you own the hotel and the discount was coming out of your pocket.  \n\nAnyone who has been married knows how tough managing the guest list is and how expensive it is.  It's not just \"invite 1 more person\".  It's invite this person I know from work, but then my fiance needs to invite a couple more people because they'll feel left out.\n\nWhy anyone would want to go to a wedding is quite beyond me.", "YTA.  I guarantee parents are paying for this lavish wedding and probably had more say in the guestlist than the bride and groom.  Your friend asked for a favor and a true friend would've said yes with NSA.  That's not what happened here. You sound entitled, petty, vindictive and spiteful.  Why would anybody want someone like that at their wedding.  If the bride had said I don't want you there then by all means cancel the rooms. I understand why you would feel hurt but seriously grow up.", "She\u2019s petty and you by pulling the rooms are worse.", "ESH, she could have at least offered but you didn't have to turn around and be petty.", "You didn't have to cancel the rooms.

It was a favor and you knew you weren\u2019t invited beforehand", "Hey OP?   Question - whose name did you reserve the block under and whose credit card did you use?", "Wow, just wow. \n\nYou admitted you aren't close. Just because she asked for a favor doesn't mean she OWES you anything. You could have declined or explained at the very beginning that you were only doing this for the invite.\n\nSo, instead of being understanding, you screwed everyone over.\n\nYou should have told the bride that your favors come with strings attached.\n\nHUGE YTA.", "YTA. She\u2019s a former coworker, not your friend. She asked you for a favor, you obliged. The favor didn\u2019t cost you anything unless you own the hotel. It doesn\u2019t entitle you to an invitation. If she included you in the actual planning process and sought your opinion then, maybe she would be in the wrong. Perhaps if you had a relationship with more depth than occasional text messages you\u2019d have an expectation to be invited. A normal person would be happy they could effortlessly help out an acquaintance, a jerk would be upset they got nothing in return, only an asshole would irrationally seek vengeance for an imaginary slight.", "YTA. The bride almost certainly did not think of the favor she asked as all that big or all that personal. It's not like you made her wedding dress or crafted the center pieces by hand. Now. Maybe you did use up a lot of capital at your job by pushing for the best rate you could get her. Maybe you can give that rate to x number of clients per year and you feel you wasted that on her. I don't know. But crucially, she probably doesn't know either! She probably just thinks you typed in some numbers and called it a day. If the favor was actually a sacrifice on your part, I get why you'd be upset, but you probably should have considered whether she was a close enough friend to be worth that. Either way, cancelling the reservations outright is super petty.\n\nAnd btw, a coworker I really like did my wedding dress alterations and refused to let me pay her even though I'd already very sheepishly explained that I would love to have her at my wedding but I had too many cousins and a strict capacity limit at the venue. So, your expectations about how this would go are, let's say, not universal.", "NTA. But also 100 ppl at a wedding isn\u2019t a large wedding for everyone. We were limited to 125 ppl at mine and we had to leave out so many people. We couldn\u2019t invite any friends except the ones in the wedding party. We are so close to our families and it was basically limited to that.", "NTA. She was using you and you called her on it.", "FYI if you want your verdict to be counted correctly you have to include only one. Since you have both \"NTA\" and \"ESH\" in your comment the bot can't determine what your verdict is.", "Thah should have been outlined before doing the favor. She knew she wasn\u2019t invited when she was asked.", "BECAUSE OP IS A DOORMAT. LET ME USE MY EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT ON THIS FORMER COLLAAGUE I HAVN'T TALKED TO IN MONTHS.", "NTA you\u2019ve been taken advantage of.", "I get maybe if she wasn't initially invited, but once she reached out about the dress code, the bride should have immediately added her to the guest list.", "Op should have named her price before doing the favor. She knew she wasn\u2019t invited when she was asked.", "yeah checkout that second edit. going about bragging about the discount too", "Perfectly worded.", "We worked together for two years prior to my switching occupations. Suites were less than $100 a night when they would normally sell for about $500+. We hadn\u2019t worked together for a year but we would text, and hang out whenever it was someone birthday or a group gathering.", "YES - this was my thought as well.   Hotels do commonly discount for group bookings.     So OP what was the discount you got her as a \"friend\"?", "JAH needs to be added to the Official Judgment Menu!\n\nTill then\u2026 NTA!", "She asked for and received a huge favor, bragged about it, then didn\u2019t invite OP. The \u201cfriend\u201d is a user.", "This.  OP straight up said they weren't close.  She called OP because that's OPs profession. Not because they were great friends.  OP also doesn't state that there was any risk to self for giving the discount,  and it's common for hotels to be able to give one if asked.", "This was my thought as well!! OP obviously YTA! You don\u2019t get to invite yourself to someone\u2019s wedding! She wasn\u2019t asking her good friend for a favor, she was asking an acquaintance who works at a hotel now to do their job. The amount of people saying n t a are mind blowing to me", "THANK YOU!   An **acquaintance** not a friend.   Not a wild thing to ask, and OP could have said no.   Instead she assumed.     & I too would love to know if hotel management knew she cancelled the block.    If I were the bride,  I'd be on the phone with the hotel for answers.", "I agree, and don't get why you are downvoted.", "I agree, mostly because it doesn't sound like they were ever actually friends, just work friends which is very different. It sounds like this was a past coworker who reached out in the context of OPs new job. If you knew someone in a professional capacity this seems like a normal thing to ask for. Discounts on hotel blocks are extremely common! That's the whole point of a hotel block! It sounds like OP chose to offer an unusually generous discount, but unless the bride demanded anything above and beyond a normal \"would you offer a discount for my wedding block\" then it is extremely out of line for OP to make this so personal and really bad business to piss of an entire wedding party.", "Not downvoting you at all Semi.   My thoughts exactly.\n\nThe were acquaintances from a previous job.  The bride reached out, simply asked if there was any way there could be a discount.   OP helped - whether it be through a \"friends/family discount\" or even the hotel policy with group bookings.   We don't know.   Thing is there was no loss of $$ on OP's side, but then assumed that because she did this, she'd be on the guest list.    I personally would never expect that.   You do things /go out of your way for people because you want to, Not because you expect something in return.   When OP found out she was not on the list - she cancelled the rooms.   Personally, if I were the bride, I would have called management to ask how, with confirmation #'s ect, especially if they were reserved under anyone's but OP's cc?    THOUGHTS?", "There would be a time limit on it - but my question is under who's name and CC was the block under?   If not the OP's then the bride has every reason to complain to management for this being cancelled.", "Each room was reserved under the wedding block name.  Normally I would have a contract, credit card authorization or deposit taken beforehand but since we were friends I waived all that. They would have paid at check in but it never got to that point.", "Lol you identify with the brides situation because you're a user too and you think that's ok.  WOW!", "People who ask for favors for a wedding/party then don't invite said person are aholes. OPs not friend is an ahole, you and your \"sheepish-ness\"? Ahole.", "How is the OP asking their boss for a discount considered a \u201chuge favor\u201d??? It definitely didn\u2019t cost them any time or money. If anyone deserves an invitation for providing a hotel room discount, it\u2019s the OP\u2019s boss or whoever authorized it.", "Op knew?  Why would you assume that?  I would not.  If someone asked be for a favor, around graduate, wedding, etc, I would assume I am at least invited.\n\nOr do you mean the BRIDE knew and still asked the favor?", "They text regularly?  They just have not seen each other?  I don't see or call my mom every day- but we text most days?", "Not just rooms but suites. Big difference.", "NTA She's a user. Good thing you canceled. She deserves it.", "thanks, that is quite a discount.", "So this discount was going to cost your hotel over $4000, I get nervous when I give a guest 30 off their room price.", "Lol no. She was asking for a discount, that's not OPs job.", "Me too. \n\nBut if you go against the majority, they downvote you into oblivion", "OP is management. They gave them a sweetheart deal and then OP's \"friend\" bragged about how much they were saving so they could upgrade other stuff.", "Do you not know what a favour is? \n\nAsking someone to use their position and/or contacts to provide a service and/or goods at a discounted price is literally the most basic favour one could ask. \n\nOP's \"friend\" could ask OP's boss, and then your logic would be accurate. But they didn't as they likely didn't know said boss. \n\nOP called in a favour from their boss and/or used their own employment perks to in turn afford this favour to the \"friend\". Why is this difficult to understand? \n\nWhy don't you go into a hotel where you don't know anyone at all, ask for management and see how it goes asking for a large discount on several rooms. I'm not sure where OP is but, certainly where I am, the minute someone says \"wedding\" the prices tend to go up, not down.", "Idk how often OP can ask for massive discounts without it impacting their work appearance (not arguing whether that's fair or not) but I definitely wouldn't want to be wasting one of my few opportunities on somebdoy who wouldn't invite me to a 100+ person wedding.\n\nIt costs OP something to ask whether tangible or not.\n\nEdit: my husband worked for a company that gave discounts on their products but only up to a limit each year to avoid potential issues like reselling, etc. If he got close to that limit, his managers would definitely be giving him the side eye", "Tell me you've never worked an actual career without telling me....", "If the bride is not close enough to OP to want to invite her to a big wedding then it's horrible that she felt like she could ask that big of a favour. She was just using OP and hoped OP would be too much of a pushover to take the favour back once it was granted. Good on OP for standing up for herself - it's so easy to let people walk over you for fear of you coming across as the bad guy. It would be a different story if OP offered instead of being asked.\n\nNTA", "Karma is something you create not something that just happens. If this wedding was 200 + guests and OP saved her *hundreds* that\u2019s worth the price of a filet mignon and a glass of champagne. I\u2019m good enough to do you major favors but not buy me dinner? Hell no. Kiss me before you f me.", "OUCH, I got downvoted too.   <hugs>  lol", "Being excited you can afford other things because of a deal you got isn't strictly \"bragging.\"", "Hi UHA, sorry but I missed that part and can't find her responses.", "Petty begets petty. If you're going to act out, you can't expect other people to not stoop to your level. \n\nThere was a mom here whose 16 year old son designed and made the entire wedding dress of one of his cousins, and then wasn't invited to the wedding because it's \"Adults only\", nor was he paid for the time and materials that went into making the dress. An invite would have smoothed everything over, but the bride insisted that no children could come. \n\nToo young to be going to the wedding, too young to be doing unpaid labor for your day. \n\nThere was another where the person was an old friend of the couple's and was asked to bake the wedding cake as a wedding gift. Turns out, she found out a week before the wedding that she wasn't an \"Assumed invite\", they had just assumed a wedding present was owed despite not inviting the OP. \n\nThese situations are no different.", "Your examples all take time and effort. Asking your boss a question cost absolutely nothing for the OP.", "Uh, based on her edit it. Saying she used OPs discount, so they could upgrade things but then tells OP that they don't have the budget to add another person is bs.", "It's literally in her edit. Refresh.", "These are examples of people that put actual effort, time, and money into someone else\u2019s wedding that should be expecting an invitation at the very least. \n\nAsking a former coworker to ask their employer if they could provide a discount and returning the employer\u2019s decision cost OP absolutely nothing and entitles them to nothing more than a \u201cThank you!!!\u201d", "OP is the GM and heavily discounted those rooms.", "OP is the boss.  I wonder how many years it took her to get into management to have the ability to do what the bride wanted of her.  Why are people here discounting OPs value?  Or the value behind what she is able to do?  Why didn't the bride just get a block discount at her own hotel?  That's like saying an hour of a CPAs time is worth an hour of an accounts receivable clerks time.", "100 people isn't actually that big depending on the size of their families. Split 50 for the bride, 50 for the groom. If I were to invite my immediate family (parents, siblings+families, grandparents, aunts/uncles+families) I would be at 38 out of my 50. If I have 4 bridesmaids, which is conservative these days,  I now have 8 spots to fit friends. Eight.", "got it, thx.    (net sucks here)", "Except the coworkers time to request and book the rooms, and idk about ops hotel, but mine only gave you a limited number of times you could use your discount, so potentially putting them out on part of their compensation.", "Op said 100 was just the bride's side.", "I had about 80 people and we could not believe how quickly the guest list filled up with just the family that we were obligated to invite. We had to cut quite a few friends that we wanted to invite for cousins that we barely know.", "In the post OP says that she gave them a discount *due to their friendship*, not because she wanted to go to the wedding. There's nothing in there at all about 'I gave them a discount because I really wanted to go to the wedding'.", "If her parents are paying for things and she's obligated to invite distant relatives, as OP did state,  it's still going to fill up fast.", "Op saved her over $4000 for all the rooms, that seems to me reason enough to invite her."]}
