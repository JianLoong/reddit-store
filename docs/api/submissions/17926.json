Friends and family, sure. She made sure you knew you werent top 100 friends, so why help her out.", "I'm going to say NTA. I feel like you shouldn't have assumed you were invited, but I understand why you did. Her wanting that favor but not inviting you is craazzyyy lol the nerve. Glad you took back your favor.", "NTA Made me laugh.  Where as I think it is incredibly rude to inquire as to an invite, the bride had a huge nerve to ask that big of a favor with zero to offer in return.  Karma.  Bride was rude and got some rude back.  You got some balls girl.", "NTA! She used you and used you good!! I know how low you probably were able to drop those rooms. Expedited  my ass!! She was hopping to skate right up to the wedding date with very little communication with you as that\u2019s how it seems to have been progressing. She really must think you\u2019re a dumb ass to try and use the excuse of over budget when YOUR the one who just saved her a HUGE chunk of change on the motel budget!! Yeah, some friend!", "I'm going with NTA. You did her a huge favor and she should be appreciative. I guess you were the only one that thought you two were friends.", "NTA. She can't have it both ways, if you're important enough to ask for a big favor like that, then you're important enough to warrant an invite. The nerve of that woman.", "INFO\n\nPlease elaborate on \"a very decent price compared to what they would normally sell for\".  Don't hotels commonly discount for groups, friend or no friend?\n\nAlso, how long ago did you work with her?  You say you guys weren't as close anymore.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d also suggest splitting the relationship with this \u201cfriend\u201d, I\u2019d bet my left leg that she was just using you and doesn\u2019t see you as such.", "NTA - Play stupid games, get stupid prizes.  \n\nNo one should be asking someone that isn't even invited to the wedding for such a huge favor.  She could have used her own discount at the hotel she works at, instead she asked you because you had moved up to a much fancier place.  Even asking you for the favor was an implied invitation, and you should have been invited at that point whether or not you were able to get the discount she wanted.\n\nThe people that are calling you out are laughable.  They're acting like being invited to the wedding is some huge benefit to you.  It's not.  You don't get anything for going to a wedding, in fact the only benefit of doing such a big favor is usually that the bride considers that your present instead of expecting you to buy something as well.\n\nBut not inviting you was a slap in the face.  Pointing out that you're not even in her top hundred people (and the groom's side likely has as many people, so the wedding is already over 200) is rude as hell.  I know the price point those suites were likely at, and you saved her thousands to get discounts on 10 suites with very little notice.\n\nShe showed you that you aren't a friend, just a contact she thought she could use and then ignore.  I'd suggest breaking contact with her, and the next time someone asks you for a \"favor\" make sure you know exactly what the situation is and whether or not you're invited to the event before you answer.", "NTA you did a favor for who you thought was a friend - they turned out not to be your friend. Favor rescinded. Honestly, it doesn\u2019t even matter if you ARE TA, it\u2019s your prerogative to not do favors for people who have hurt your feelings.", "NTA.  She was using you and you called her on it.  Not your friend.  She should have left room for a few people like this in her invites as one normally does for a wedding for a) friends and b) especially friends that help with wedding related activities of which using your position at a fancier hotel was.", "ESH. It's incredibly tacky of her to ask for a considerable favor for her wedding and not invite you at least to the reception. \n\nHowever, you shouldn't have assumed you were invited. And it seems she never gave you even a verbal invite. You basically invited yourself to her wedding and that's also very tacky. Holding the favor you did over her head and further canceling the rooms upon learning you were not invited was an escalation and an asshole move. You were clearly not doing something out of kindness \"due to your friendship\", you were doing something and expecting a benefit in return.", "ESH, she clearly was just using you to get discounted rooms, which is fucked up. You never got invited, you just assumed you were going. And canceled the rooms when you found out you weren't, which is also fucked up.", "Why are you so desperate to go? I could see being a little hurt, but someone asked you to do a favor and you chose to do it, and it was no expense for you. The room cancelling after insisting she can squeeze one more person is weird. It's weird you asked about theme when you hadn't gotten an invitation. Would have been N A H for feeling hurt but YTA for the revenge cancellation retaliation.", "NTA. If someone would do me a huge favour regarding to my wedding, a favour I have asked for...I would feel completely shallow not inviting them.", "YTA - who cares who else was invited? You barely know this person, you aren\u2019t her friend, you aren\u2019t her family. She asked you for a favour and you said yes.", ">TL,DR: I cancelled my friend\u2019s wedding block since I wasn\u2019t invited.\n\nYTA\n\nShe didn't ask for you to set aside a block with any strings attached. She reached out to you b/c you WORK AT A HOTEL.  This is not a wild favor to ask someone you are acquainted with, and is super presumptuous on your part to think anything beyond WHAT SHE ASKED.\n\nIs your boss aware you cancelled a wedding block?  WOOOOO.  You didn't give them that rate, either. You don't own the hotel.", "Riiiiight up until the end you had it, and then you decided to be TA by delivering the rug pull. So ESH: her for abusing your hospitality, and you for adding conditions to said hospitality after the fact. You had the chance to be the bigger person and tossed it.\n\nOf course, your employer might also question your assignment of rates based on your personal feelings about the customer either for good or ill.", "Yes YTA. You assumed you were invited and then attempted to guilt your way into an invite by holding the discount over her head.\n\nYou're choosing to be an AH. I suggest choosing to be a decent person and give her the discount if you're able. Taking that away over an invite is so childish. I wouldn't ever talk to you again if I was her. How ridiculous.", "YTA. You can be disappointed to not be invited but cancelling their accommodation is petty and hurts the bridesmaids you've never met. Have you had a wedding? The guest list balloons out of control quickly because if you invite the one cousin you like, you've then got to invite their siblings, spouses, kids, etc. It can be really hard to fit in one more person, frankly. \n\nThere are lots of ways to pay you back for doing her a favor other than an invitation to the wedding. Now you'll never know how she'd have reciprocated.", "YTA\n\nYou gave them a price and pulled a very petty move.  So what if you weren't invited?  It's not like you own the hotel and the discount was coming out of your pocket.  \n\nAnyone who has been married knows how tough managing the guest list is and how expensive it is.  It's not just \"invite 1 more person\".  It's invite this person I know from work, but then my fiance needs to invite a couple more people because they'll feel left out.\n\nWhy anyone would want to go to a wedding is quite beyond me.", "YTA.  I guarantee parents are paying for this lavish wedding and probably had more say in the guestlist than the bride and groom.  Your friend asked for a favor and a true friend would've said yes with NSA.  That's not what happened here. You sound entitled, petty, vindictive and spiteful.  Why would anybody want someone like that at their wedding.  If the bride had said I don't want you there then by all means cancel the rooms. I understand why you would feel hurt but seriously grow up.", "She\u2019s petty and you by pulling the rooms are worse.", "ESH, she could have at least offered but you didn't have to turn around and be petty.", "You didn't have to cancel the rooms.  Yes, she should've invited you.  ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Why waste those on someone that you thought a friend but found out right away was not a friend.  Bride had the same amount of time to find some other poor sucker to use.

She asked for a favor from a co worker and said co worker decided to do her a favor. It\u2019s not her money she put in, it\u2019s the companies. By that logic the owner should be invited because ultimately he is the one getting less money. \nShe was able to get discounts and that\u2019s it. There were never strings attached to it. OP just assumed there was and got butthurt when she found out and decided to fuck them over out of spite", "No, they don\u2019t. A favor is a favor. It\u2019s not a business transaction. A decent person would show appreciation for the favor but this is not automatically an invite to a short notice wedding. I also don\u2019t think this would count as appreciation as  OP would have had to spend money to get a gift, maybe a new dress or whatever. Appreciation for a favor amongst friends can be shown multiple different ways but OP didn\u2019t even wait for that, she just went apeshit and fucked over guests because of her butthurtness", "As a true friend as OP claims to be you help others without expecting immediate returns", "There was no friendship but OP didn't find out at this point, they always knew. They didn't do a favor for a friend, they gave someone a discount in exchange for an invite. OP is as transactional and self-serving as the former \"friend\".", "I've never heard of that being an issue, but if it was, then the OP have included it. As they describe it, they didn't mention any ossie getting the discount sent them cancelled our of anger. If they were capped to one friends and family discount a year, then it would be relevant to the post. Since it's not there, I can only go by the actions only done for revenge.", "Respectfully, I disagree. \n\nShe asked OP for help with a discount without promising an invite. OP had the choice to say no from the beginning. OP assumed she was invited without ever receiving a formal invitation. I don't blame the bride for asking. It never hurts to ask. It does hurt to assume. \n\nThe bride said she was already struggling with being able to afford the plans as is, hence asking if she's able to give a discount. She didn't demand anything from OP, she simply asked. She didn't promise an invitation. \n\nI understand OP being hurt about not getting invited but they aren't even that close and if the bride is already financially struggling, even with a discount, then OP should just respect that. \n\nOP isn't obligated to help the bride but she **was** happy to and able to do so. Taking that away just to be spiteful is so lame and childish. \n\nI don't think asking for help is the same as using someone. That's just my opinion.", "or don't do things for people if you're going to treat it as a transaction. You can do nice things without expecting something in return.", "It will probably go on OPs record of friends and family discounts she gave in a timeframe and some other REAL friend (or family) she may not be able to help consequently.", "Anyone you ask for a huge wedding-related favor should be on your invite list.  Anything else is incredibly tacky.", "As she should. If this happened to me i would do the same thing. Is it petty? Perhaps, but so is asking someone for a discount on 10 rooms for a hotel and then not even inviting OP to the reception. 10 hotel rooms at a discounted rate is actually insane and OP did deserve an invite to the wedding for doing so. \nMaybe the bride should learn to respect the people she\u2019s asking favors of, what she did it\u2019s absolutley disrespectful", "I don't understand why women are always expected to be sweet and easy going and be used without saying anything.  I LOVE this post.  I'm getting the biggest laugh out of it.  How many of us have been the person that \"friends\" ask for favors.  A ride to or from the airport, watch my house or animals while I'm gone, loan them x, y, z, grab thier package, listen to them moan on about the latest bf ad naseum, babysit etc etc then you hear about thier social calendar and you're not on it.  Parties, movies, bunko whatever.  This girl just got revenge for every woman that smiled to make nice while being used.  Good on ya sister.", "You invented that part.  Read it again.  OP said not as close because of schedule but friends.", "Might be the case, yes. But if you only want to help under conditions then maybe don\u2019t offer help where a) money is involved and b) you are screwing over 3rd parties by being petty \n\nOP could have left it at that and cut contact with her if she was so hurt", "Yeah, you can get revenge and still be an AH. Just like OP showed her true colors", "This sounds like a lot of personal issues of yours that have nothing to do with the post LOL.", "I'm not inventing anything. OP did the discount because they thought they were going to be invited to the wedding, and cancelled the rooms altogether when they learned they weren't invited. OP was never friends with this person. They just wanted to attend a wedding.", "Because I'm celebrating her having some friendship boundaries that are healthy for her that more women should have instead of signing up for being taken advantage of then feeling bad about it?
