No one can smile nicely while freezing. How did the bride not plan for nice matching shawls for the church or outside? \n\nSuggestions: \n1. Maybe you can plan a matching shawl/lovely scarf/ sheer cover to help you. Have it at the front where you will sit before the ceremony or have your plus one put it there. \n\n2. Bring your own nice looking bag with your boots, nice shawl, gloves and winter jacket for pictures outside. In my SIL\u2019s case, when they walk to the location to take pictures the ladies and my SIL took of their things (but kept the boots on). Is the dress long enough to shield this? \n\n3. Maybe call/speak to a couple of the bridesmaids separately to see what they are planning. But you bring something otherwise they will accuse you of wrecking the pictures by looking frozen and unable to smile. \n\n4. When you walk out of the church (and before you get in the vehicle) have your plus one meet you with your bag/winter jacket etc. Or say you will drive yourself. \n\nI know this is stressful as the bride has left you to fend for yourselves (which is very stupid and poor planning).

It's gonna be more awkward when everyone is shivering in the photos. This is ridiculous, and that weather is very cold.", "NTA, I think you're raising a sensible point and there's no way \"perfect\" pictures should take precedence over guests' comfort and health. You're a friend, not a prop.\n\nHow much of the time are you likely to be outside though? Maybe it won't be that bad if you just have to pop in and out a few minutes at a time for outdoors pictures with the bride. Or how about you all wear matching warm shawls (though admittedly it's very short notice to arrange that) instead of everyone showing up in a different coat?", "Nta. I get it gold even if i wear normal clothes by that temperature. So you are NOT the AH", "NTA she should buy you matching furs then, how awful x", "NTA. Hypothermia is no joke.

When my sister realized the weather would be really cold for her wedding, she realized a mishmash of coats wouldn't look great in the photos... So she bought us all thick faux fur shawls to wear that matched and looked great with our dresses.\n\nIf most of the day will be indoors in a heated area, and only the formal pictures will be outside, then I can see where this bride is coming from (she should still allow coats between photos though). But if any significant part of the day is outside, then absolutely not, it's dangerous to have you out there without any protection against the cold.", "NTA and clearly your friend is clueless for not keeping the weather conditions in mind.", "Info: is the wedding outside?", "NTA From my username you'll see that I'm a fellow Northerner and we are known for 'not feeling the cold' and going out without coats in the middle of winter - but there's a huge difference between walking from one crowded pub to the next, and standing round for ages at a wedding. \n\nFair enough to ask you to take a coat off for a few minutes for photos, but no way should you be expected to freeze all day - the photos will look a bit odd with everyone being blue round the edges. \n\nThe bride should have known this was a possibility when booking a December wedding and organised matching/coordinated coats/shawls or similar.", "NTA A frozen corpse will also ruin the photos. Also, since when are weddings more about the photos than the marriage or the day itself? I feel like her priorities are amiss.", "As a Canadian I feel uniquely qualified to answer this \u2026 -4 is spring time weather here, considered quite mild for this time of year.  Exposed flesh will freeze but quite slowly (well compared to -40) and you should be fine for about 30 minutes or so with no coat providing you have somewhere to warm up afterwards or were dressed properly. There is no way she can have her cake and eat it too, she either needs to move the wedding inside or allow you to wear appropriate clothing - long johns under your dress, wool socks, a proper jacket and toque and gloves will be 100% necessary if you are out for more than 20-30 minutes at most. I get she has a vision for her wedding but it\u2019s just not realistic and you are not overreacting \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThis makes me think of a wedding that happened at my old work place. Ceremony was in the courtyard\u2026in November in Canada. We felt awful watching the bridesmaids in their strapless dresses. It was a quick ceremony but still.\n\nAnyway, I do think there\u2019s some hyperbole going on in the comments. The chances of developing hypothermia at those temps, even in a cold building, are pretty low, especially with just the length of the ceremony. You\u2019d be fine to take some pictures outside even. And frostbite is definitely not going to happen (unless there\u2019s a thick layer of snow your bare feet will also be standing in). But regardless of all that, it is going to be uncomfortable and miserable and you should have something nearby that when pictures aren\u2019t being taken you can pull on for a quick warm up\u2026whether that be a jacket, sweater, shawl or blanket.", "NTA - it's the rural north of England in December, what did she expect!

Jacket.\nGet a cute cover for a hot water bottle, slap googly eyes on it and introduce it as your plus one if you have to. Get a pack of chemical handwarmers and stuff them down your front if need be. Staying warm is much more important than her photos being perfect.

Ironclad!", "\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23", "I just saw a TikTok where a woman bought a fancy tree skirt and wore it as a cape.  It was a pretty blue color.", "I used to buy winter coats at an international military surplus store. I\u2019m a tall woman, and it was a wonderful place to buy long wool coats. I had a Swiss Army coat and a Swedish Navy coat. They both went with just about everything, and the Swedish coat had these lovely buttons that were absolutely infuriating to fasten with gloves on. If you want to wear a long coat but aren\u2019t a flasher, go international military surplus. It\u2019s high-quality, affordable, and surprisingly fashionable.", "Hence why my Florida wedding was planned to have the ceremony on a covered patio with an indoor reception! It was SO unseasonably hot though, which sucked. I was hoping for 60s when November usually 70s and it was high 80s \ud83d\ude2d", "My nose immediately goes red in the cold and my hands go blue (ah the joys of having thyroid issues).\nI would straight up look hideous in these photos.", "Imagine if OP\u2019s friend cared about her bridesmaids just a tiny fraction this much. \n\nNTA", "They\u2019re not even heating the church? Everyone is going to be freezing their asses off. What on earth was this woman thinking? How long is this ceremony going to last? Is the bride going to be mad when everyone is wearing coats and gloves in photos that include guests? This whole thing is bonkers.", "NO!!!", "Tree skirts! They look like capes", "NTA - wear a coat or beautiful long warm cloak - look on Etsy. My cousin got married in March in southern UK & rare event, it snowed. I\u2019ve never been so cold & can\u2019t even imagine how frigid the North will be. We still talk about how the bride wore blue - as in cyanosis due to the cold, which is even clear in the pics. Wear/bring warm outerwear, don\u2019t  get sick for photos.  In 20 years, if they\u2019re still married, you can laugh about how cold it was.", "NTA. What type of ghoul wants her friends and family to die of hypothermia for a wedding?", "My question is, what is the bride wearing? Does she have some luxurious faux fur cover up and expect you guys to stand there blue and red?\n\nI wouldn't even acknowledge the request and have a nice coat anyways", "No, just no. I got married at Icehotel mening that our ceremony was held in a church made of snow and the temperature inside was -4 degrees celcius. You can not be out in that weather for long if not properly dressed, and this wedding is in the UK mening that you will also have to deal with wind and humidity. I am telling you, as a person Who lived above the artic cirkle for 12 years and had an outdoors ceremony that this will end badly, like really badly. Open toed shoes? Yeah, you risk severe frost bite, the kind where you need to amputate toes. And have you ever really freazed? Not just be cold but actually been so cold that the shivers are becoming violent spasms? I have, and I can tell you that when you get to that point you just cant function any more. It is hard to talk, it is really hard to do any motorfunction like holding things and if you are anything like me you will feel quite nauseus. Trust me, her pictures will not look good. And when you get that cold it takes a while to warm up, have you been really cold it can take hours to get back to normal. \n\nThis bride does not know what she is asking for, and she will not get the pretty winter pictures she wants.", "Oh my, I did not get that from the original post. \nIt can get cold in churches, but really, then work together to find a pretty shawl that matches the dresses (depending on the style dress)", "They're going to change their tune fast. I attended a very small wedding (8 people including bride and groom) on top of a mountain and it was chilly even in spring; we were all wearing thin dresses. We shed the coats for the <10 minute ceremony (with the photographer taking shots), put the coats back on for champagne, took the coats off again for group photos (maybe 3-5 minutes each person), and the coats were on again until we were back inside.\n\nKeep your coat close by on the wedding day. I GUARANTEE everyone is going to be wearing them.", "No kidding. I'm 41 and i feel like i get a new illness every year. \n\nI wish you the best with your surgery\u2764\ufe0f Get healthy soon or as healthy as you can, haha.", "If OP\u2019s in the UK it might be a historic church that doesn\u2019t have heating."]}
