It\u2019s a rather nice area. Our next door neighbour has her balcony next to ours.\n\nMy husband is half Spanish half Polish, I am Polish. We speak both languages and often speak in a weird amalgamation of both, sometimes adding English to the mix.\n\nAnyway, both languages are spoken rather fast (or they seem so) and can sound a bit \u2018aggressive\u2019 if you\u2019re not used to them. I\u2019ve had people assume I was angry because of how the language sounded to them when I was having a completely pleasant conversation.\n\nMy neighbour was no exception, she\u2019s heard us talking and must have assumed we were arguing (we weren\u2019t). She approached me and asked me, concerned, if I was okay. I was confused and she explained that she\u2019d heard our arguments.\n\nI explained that I was fine and we hadn\u2019t argued at all. I suggested that it might be because of how harsh both languages can sound.\n\nShe didn\u2019t believe me and told me she was there if I needed help.\n\nI told my husband, we laughed and decided to speak a bit more quietly just in case.\n\nOne day, we were chatting and joking around when two police officers knocked on our door. Someone called with concerns about my well-being. WTF? We explained our situation, they took me aside and I had to explain everything. It was humiliating, even more so for my poor husband.\n\nThe next day, my neighbour approached me again and I repeated that we weren\u2019t arguing and she had to let it go. She told me that she wouldn\u2019t have to worry if we just switched to English. I told her we wouldn\u2019t be doing that and she\u2019d have to take my word for it and stop bothering us.\n\nLast night, she posted a recording to our neighbourhood\u2019s group. It was  of me having a good time with my husband, joking around. She said she believed I was in danger and asked what do to and who to report it to because I was in denial.\n\nPeople were agreeing with her, calling me names and told her to keep recording because I was covering for him and complaining how difficult it was to help foreigners when they don\u2019t speak English. The called me all sorts of names for \u2018covering\u2019 for my husband and I was just confused. It was until someone who spoke Spanish chimed in and said that we weren\u2019t arguing. Someone else who spoke Polish said the same thing and told her to mind her own business instead of recording people.\n\nShe removed the recording. Today, she knocked on my door, shouting at me, telling me I humiliated her and I must have done it on purpose to toy with her when she was just concerned.\n\nI told her I explained it to her many times but she wouldn\u2019t listen, she kept shouting and calling me names and I just shut the door in her face.\n\nMy neighbour is still furious with me and I am confused and I do feel bad because I understand where she was coming from and she had good intentions. Should I had switched to English to avoid the whole situation? It would\u2019ve been an easy fix. Am I the asshole for confusing her?\n\n\nEdit: i just wanted to clarify, we really weren\u2019t loud. Our walls are thin, I can easily hear her talking in her flat and she talks \u201cnormally\u201d if she\u2019s in the adjacent room. She recorded is from the balcony, we had our balcony door open and we\u2019re chatting inside. She video recorded from her balcony when she was outside.

You are wrong about her having a good intention. If she did, she would have not been embarrassed.  Depending where you live, her recording you without your consent is illegal.  At very least she owes you and your husband a sincere apology You may want to take an order of protection against this person so she never interfere in your life again.", "NTA.  She's a nosy busybody.  What you discuss with your husband is none of damn business.  She checked in once and you assured her it was just her perception of the language.  That should have been the end of it.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, who thinks it's okay to record and report someone who doesn't want it?\n\nThink about it this way, if she was right and you were being abused, calling the police could have very well gotten you killed. An abuser wouldn't be likely to believe the neighbor acted on her own.\n\nShe may have been coming from a good place when she first approached you and asked about it, but everything after was purely self serving.\n\nPSA: If you know someone in an abusive relationship, you can NOT force them out of it like this neighbor tried to do. The victim is the only one who can decide what help they get and when.

I would honestly try to clear the air.  As you noted, she was trying to do the right thing, and maybe for reasons you're not aware of.  Reporting her as others have noted isn't going to help and will just make the situation worse.  Her reaction to the neighborhood post is not ok either, given she was found in the wrong and called out for it.

Eastern Europeans& Latin people always seem to converse & overall socialise more passionately. To an English ear, an ordinary conversation  can seem like too much  intensely expressed emotions. \n\nI've had it in my office, half of us were Eastern Europeans and half British. The Eastern Europeans were more straightforward, more pointed when giving eachother feedback and a bit more loud when talking to eachother. Our English colleagues were finding it really stressful to witness our interactions because to them, we were confrontational and aggressive. We were all taken aback and extremely surprised to hear that feedback, our interactions with eachother were not at all perceived amongst ourselves as confrontational or aggressive, rather the opposite. Took a bit of cultural awareness work  to find a middle ground that worked for both parties and reassure our colleagues we were friends and didn't hate our guts at the end of the day. I think this is the case with you and your neighbour...", "As someone who speaks another language, I really understand your frustration. Also, i cannot believe how much she stuck her nose into this! Being concerned is acceptable, but getting the police involved and even after the police have sorted it posting it on a neighbour group chat?? Ridiculous. She probably thought that she was saving her 'poor immagrant neighbour' from her husbands abuse.

Loud is loud.", "I disagree, if it can be clearly heard and recorded you don't have a *reasonable* expectation of privacy, there is a reason people move to rural locations or buy property with land for extra privacy.\n\nThe amount of privacy you have in an apartment goes down; it is that simple.", "It doesn't excuse this lady's behavior but it's pretty clear OP and husband are much louder that she wants to admit.  There's no way anyone could have made an intelligible recording of me having a normal conversation in my apartment because I'm not that loud.", "I read both po-TAY-to po-TAY-to and I laughed and laughed \ud83e\udd23", "My favorite was the Asian woman on the train who was on her phone...old guy angrily told her \"You are in England now, speak English!\"\n\nShe looked at him flatly and said \"Actually sir, right now we are in Wales, and I was speaking Welsh.\"", "Oh it\u2019s totally this. It\u2019s also completely ignoring the fact that anytime a Brit goes somewhere where English isn\u2019t the main language, they just speak in loud, slow English because god forbid they be forced to learn anything that isn\u2019t EnGliSh~! One rule for us, another for the rest of the world - welcome to the land of xenophobia and hypocrisy.", "I really hate that they even thought they were wrong for a second! British people are so damn hypocritical too - like how dare that lady pester OP about speaking English inside their OWN HOME (when that\u2019s the language they have to speak outside everyday and it\u2019s got to be a relief to go home and be free to bounce between all the languages they\u2019re most comfortable with) when God KNOWS British people are the literal worst at languages. So many people here retire to Spain - but there\u2019s literally specific \u2018expat\u2019 regions of Spain where British people just live with other British people in a little Oh Britannia in the Sun commune because they don\u2019t speak a lick of Spanish! And don\u2019t even get me started on the double standards of middle class Brits being \u2018ex-pats\u2019 whereas anyone who DARES to move to the place big headed to call itself \u2018Great Britain\u2019 is a \u2018migrant\u2019 and an \u2018immigrant\u2019 and treated like OP by AHs like the neighbour... I hate it here.", "What are you on about?", "Tbh because it\u2019s such a typical term in the UK that honestly I didn\u2019t even realise - completely an oversight on my part! Will change it to a different British slang word, but honestly most of them are to do with genitalia, male and female lol. Knob/knobhead is a favourite of mine. But yeah the UK can also be very sexist obviously. Just need to look at what\u2019s going on with the MET and the increasing list of sex crimes in the forces there \ud83d\ude2d", "I think this is turning into a you issue just like the nosey neighbor. But thanks for trying.", "While they may know their voices can be heard directly outside their home, it is not a reasonable expectation that their conversations would be blasted on the internet for all to hear.", "Ouf..... Welsh doesn't sound anything like an Asian language...", "That is the only part which is debateable IMO, but if you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy then it's not wholly unreasonable that you might be recorded, and that recording might be shared.\n\nIt is like how you can't complain if someone records you in public, you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy so they can record you and they are free to share their recording.\n\nWhat they typically can't do is monetise that recording without a waiver, but that's not what happened, it was shared, she got clarification on the content and then she took it down without being asked.\n\nSo, IMHO the neighbour was tip toeing along the line right up until she got hostile about being \"toyed\" with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow legality is not morality but here is what I think.\n\nAsking OP directly was perfectly reasonable. \n\nCalling in a police welfare check was less reasonable but not unreasonable.\n\nRecording a conversation and posting it was right on the line of what could be considered reasonable.\n\nBut getting angry about her about being humiliated and \"toyed\" with was outright unreasonable."]}
