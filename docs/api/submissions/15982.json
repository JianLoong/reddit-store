It\u2019s a rather nice area. Our next door neighbour has her balcony next to ours.\n\nMy husband is half Spanish half Polish, I am Polish. We speak both languages and often speak in a weird amalgamation of both, sometimes adding English to the mix.\n\nAnyway, both languages are spoken rather fast (or they seem so) and can sound a bit \u2018aggressive\u2019 if you\u2019re not used to them. I\u2019ve had people assume I was angry because of how the language sounded to them when I was having a completely pleasant conversation.\n\nMy neighbour was no exception, she\u2019s heard us talking and must have assumed we were arguing (we weren\u2019t). She approached me and asked me, concerned, if I was okay. I was confused and she explained that she\u2019d heard our arguments.\n\nI explained that I was fine and we hadn\u2019t argued at all. I suggested that it might be because of how harsh both languages can sound.\n\nShe didn\u2019t believe me and told me she was there if I needed help.\n\nI told my husband, we laughed and decided to speak a bit more quietly just in case.\n\nOne day, we were chatting and joking around when two police officers knocked on our door. Someone called with concerns about my well-being. WTF? We explained our situation, they took me aside and I had to explain everything. It was humiliating, even more so for my poor husband.\n\nThe next day, my neighbour approached me again and I repeated that we weren\u2019t arguing and she had to let it go. She told me that she wouldn\u2019t have to worry if we just switched to English. I told her we wouldn\u2019t be doing that and she\u2019d have to take my word for it and stop bothering us.\n\nLast night, she posted a recording to our neighbourhood\u2019s group. It was  of me having a good time with my husband, joking around. She said she believed I was in danger and asked what do to and who to report it to because I was in denial.\n\nPeople were agreeing with her, calling me names and told her to keep recording because I was covering for him and complaining how difficult it was to help foreigners when they don\u2019t speak English. The called me all sorts of names for \u2018covering\u2019 for my husband and I was just confused. It was until someone who spoke Spanish chimed in and said that we weren\u2019t arguing. Someone else who spoke Polish said the same thing and told her to mind her own business instead of recording people.\n\nShe removed the recording. Today, she knocked on my door, shouting at me, telling me I humiliated her and I must have done it on purpose to toy with her when she was just concerned.\n\nI told her I explained it to her many times but she wouldn\u2019t listen, she kept shouting and calling me names and I just shut the door in her face.\n\nMy neighbour is still furious with me and I am confused and I do feel bad because I understand where she was coming from and she had good intentions. Should I had switched to English to avoid the whole situation? It would\u2019ve been an easy fix.

Honestly, I'd report her for harassment. And recording you without your knowledge, and posting the private conversation to social media? That's a serious invasion of your privacy. \n\nYou shouldn't have to switch to her language just because she can't stay out of other people's business.", "NTA this is beyond insane. I would post publicly about this neighbor. She humiliated herself! I would post your experience and that people need to understand you are being harassed by this woman and that she\u2019s called the police on you both because you speak a different language in your own home. And that she told you to speak English. You don\u2019t appreciate your good husbands name nor yours being dragged through the mud. She deserves further humiliation  and you deserve to clear both your good names. I guarantee this isn\u2019t really about a \u201charsh\u201d sounding language. \n\nAlso, where you live is being recorded secretly legal?", "This is anti-foreigner harrassment.   \n\n\nThis won't end.  You should seek legal intervention.    \n\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n**If your neighbor actually cared about your well-being, she would have been *relieved* at the Spanish and Polish speakers clarifying that you were fine.** The fact that she was *embarassed* shows what her really motives were: eavesdropping busybody at best, outright racist xenophobe at worst.", "NTA she doesn't like not being able to eavesdrop because she is nosy, or sure doesn't like you speaking other languages because she is xenophobic. \n\nQuite likely both.\n\nPlease inform the police that she did this, because she is harassing you and trying to make it sound like your husband is abusive.", "NTA and I would have reported her that she recorded you. Take a screenshot of it etc.", "NTA - she\u2019s completely out of line. It\u2019s borderline harassment if it continues", "NTA and yes I'd report her for recording and sharing private conversations you were having in your own home with others.\n\nThe first time, when she asked, I would be grateful for her show of concern.\n\nBut then you explained clearly. And that should have put a stop to it.\n\nReporting you to the police and then putting that recording into the group is way out of line.\n\nNot to mention asking you to speak in English so she can ensure by eavesdropping that you're ok!!!!!!!\n\nShe's furious because she has embarrassed and humiliated HERSELF especially when you explained to her several times that the languages can sound aggressive to those unfamiliar. I know other languages that are the same, and asking for road directions sounds like shouting matches!\n\nSo much NTA and she needs to mind her business.", "NTA. Your neighbour is clear an A.  You are wrong about her having a good intention. If she did, she would have not been embarrassed.  Depending where you live, her recording you without your consent is illegal.  At very least she owes you and your husband a sincere apology You may want to take an order of protection against this person so she never interfere in your life again.", "NTA.  She's a nosy busybody.  What you discuss with your husband is none of damn business.  She checked in once and you assured her it was just her perception of the language.  That should have been the end of it.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, who thinks it's okay to record and report someone who doesn't want it?\n\nThink about it this way, if she was right and you were being abused, calling the police could have very well gotten you killed. An abuser wouldn't be likely to believe the neighbor acted on her own.\n\nShe may have been coming from a good place when she first approached you and asked about it, but everything after was purely self serving.\n\nPSA: If you know someone in an abusive relationship, you can NOT force them out of it like this neighbor tried to do. The victim is the only one who can decide what help they get and when. For many, the best way to help is give them someplace safe to retreat to and be their support if/when they go to the police or leave. Document/record everything you can about the abuse, but under no circumstances do you share them with anyone without explicit permission by the victim.", "NTA\nYou should report her for recording you. It\u2019s her own fault for not listening to you when you told her multiple times. I understand her wanting to look out for you, but come on just because someone is speaking another language doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re being abused even if it may sound \u201caggressive\u201d", "Nta.  \n\nTell her to shut up and mind her own business.  \n\nShe asked you a question. You answered it.  She didn't want to believe you. That's on her.   She humiliated herself.  \n\nSpeak whatever crazy mismatched language that you want. It's your life. Not hers.", "NTA Tell her people have gotten ASBOs for less.  If she keeps butting in, report her, every single time.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m half-Portuguese. To anyone who doesn\u2019t know the language, my relatives and I sound like we\u2019re seconds away from jumping over the table and strangling each other whenever we get together for big family dinners. That\u2019s just how we talk.\n\nYour busybody neighbour may have started with good intentions, but she crossed the line when she refused to accept your explanations, called the police and then proceeded to post an unauthorized recording in a community group. (Seriously, who the hell DOES that???)\n\nShe made a fool of herself, and no one else is responsible but her. There were several points for her to stop and consider, but she just kept on barreling ahead because her bigoted ass just assumed she knew best.\n\nYou are not required to have personal conversations in a different language just to satisfy someone\u2019s saviour complex.", "NTA Nothing quite like living nextdoor to a xenophobe. She's angry because she looks like a the fool and she did that all by herself.", "NTA.\n\nLet me get this straight, it was humiliating for people who spoke the languages to chime in, but not for her to record your conversations and post on the internet and also have the police show up?  The very first time she heard you, it could've been concern, and you've told her several times it's your languages. Now, I would say it's bordering on, if not is, harrassment.", "definitely nta!! and woah\u2026 id report her. id want to get farrrr away from a neighbor like that.", "NTA. This lady sounds crazy annoying", "NTA. Growing up my cousins, brother and I would speak a crazy mix of Polish,German and English.  We lived in a Slavic town in the upper United States so people kind off knew what we were talking about.  I live in the deep South now and I had to fly home for an family emergency and we all went back to talking in our crazy language.  It wasn't until I flew back to where I now live and my brain kept on crazy language mode and people thought I was having a stroke.  I had to concentrate really hard to only speak English but it only took about 2 days before I was back to \" normal \". I'm just glad my family isn't the only one that does that lol", "NTA. Some people are just interfering and have nothing better to do. Why should you switch to another language for her convenience? Maybe suggest she learns Spanish and Polish then she won\u2019t make this mistake again.", "Maybe English isn't her first language? But in all seriousness NTA.  Her recording you and posting it is very out of order. I would say that her concerns were misplaced but might have been coming from a good place but the moment she told to speak in English when speaking she can bloody well get lost...as the English say.", "NTA. What she did was likely illegal. And racist to boot.", "Nta. You should report her and gtfo", "NTA. At all.\n\nShe got what she needed after not listening to you.", "NTA when I went to Turkey, I noticed that they could be discussing the weather, and it sounded angry, like they were fighting. My reaction? Amusement. I joked about it with my ex and his friends, and talked about how it was interesting that different languages sounded different even in speed and tone. \n\nYour neighbor is a busy body who is just upset she can't understand your conversations.", "NTA! She humiliated herself, and she *chose* to remain confused and not believe you.", "The headline makes it seem like you might be, but the story makes me say NTA. You can speak any language you want in your own home. Any chance there is a law against recording someone without permission where you live?", "Nta l she\u2019s probably a racist tbh", "NTA at all, speak whatever language you want in your own home (or outside! It's a private conversation!) Can you report your neighbor to your landlord for continuously harassing you and eavesdropping?", "NTA. Those were not good intentions after having explained to her, and especially after the police came.  You messed up her opportunistic virtue signaling.", "NTA - But you should switch to English and just sound as angry as possible while having normal conversations.  See what she does with that lol.", "NTA she\u2019s nosy, she\u2019s harassing you, and she\u2019s probably racist. Do not change who you are and speak English to accommodate those who think they know better than everyone else.", "NTA. Report her to the police for continual harassment and ask them what can be done/documented about making false reports about you by your neighbor.\n\nYour neighbor is very ignorant and entitled. Especially telling you to speak English and it wouldn't be a problem? They are the only one with the issue and it's ugly.", "NTA\n\nLook it's all good to watch for domestic violence but you have to take people at their word.\n\nNosy neighbour got what she deserved.", "She recorded a private conversation and posted it on a public group and then had the gall to say you embarrassed *her*?!\n\nWtf is wrong with that woman?  NTA", "This woman is nuts.  She thinks she has the power to dictate what language you use in the privacy of your own home?  NTA.", "Okay, even if you were being abused, at some point she has offered help, you have turned it down. This is some serious savior crap.", "NTA, get a lawyer and cameras for the house. This is harassment.", "NTA this is harassment and and isn\u2019t it slander?", "Start only speaking to her in polish.\n\nNTA.", "Racism is never cute. NTA, sorry your neighbor sucks", "As a Polish speaking person who also speaks German, another aggressive sounding language - NTA.", "NTA - The neighbor is a snoopy busybody!   Very annoying that she didn't take your word for it that you are OK", "NTA but you need to get the law or landlord involved. You have a nosy neighbor who is recording you and posting you online. What if either of your jobs found out about this? Cops coming to your door, what if it escalated beyond a welfare check? This can't continue.", "Nta and report her to police for harassment n abuse of emergency services. Should put a stop to it.", "She\u2019s just salty she can\u2019t eavesdrop. Screw her. NTA.", "NTA.  I would honestly try to clear the air.  As you noted, she was trying to do the right thing, and maybe for reasons you're not aware of.  Reporting her as others have noted isn't going to help and will just make the situation worse.  Her reaction to the neighborhood post is not ok either, given she was found in the wrong and called out for it.  You don't need to switch to English either.  \n\nIf you are interested in having a caring neighbor, try to repair the situation.  No apologies, but maybe a beer or wine and chat.  Conflict is often best resolved without more conflict.", "NTA your neighbor is a busybody and needs to mind her own business. If you were in the US id suggest a harassment suit if it continued", "I understand both sides of the situation but don't understand why you're talking so loud?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Having a camera or recorder on your balcony is perfectly legal even in 2 party consent states.  Many criminals (especially burglars) are caught this way.  I have no idea about the UK.
