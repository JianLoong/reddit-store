{"id": 17337, "submission_id": "13ijvkx", "title": "AITA for not trying harder to get my ex\u2019s niece to forgive my ex and his new girlfriend?", "selftext": "So I (28F) dated my ex (31M) for four years. Over this period, I got to meet his family and got along very well with everyone, particularly his brother\u2019s eldest daughter (15F now, 11 when I first met her).\n\nShe was incredibly shy when we first met and had trouble making friends, but we had a lot of the same nerdy interests so I\u2019ve taken her on outings related to those interests (like cons and trips to hobby stores) along with my group of friends, who all adore her and see her like a little sister. Being around people who share her interests has made her more confident and now she has a ton of friends her own age in addition to still going with us to cons. Her parents have even thanked me for helping her come out of her shell.\n\nWell, around two months back I discovered my boyfriend and one of my friends, Hannah (27F), had been having an affair for almost a year. After a lot of tears and both of them begging for forgiveness, I broke up with him and Hannah was cut out from the friend group (all our other friends were disgusted by what she did).\n\nI was worried this would mean I wouldn't be allowed around niece anymore, but her parents told me that they had no issue with me remaining in her life since I had become a family friend. Here\u2019s the issue: I didn't tell niece about the cheating, but she must have put 2 and 2 together when ex and Hannah started dating immediately after our breakup and Hannah was no longer part of the group. Now she\u2019s refusing to talk to either of them.\n\nMy ex reached out to me for help, and I told niece that she didn\u2019t need to be angry at her uncle on my behalf, but she said that she was just disappointed he'd do that to someone and she'd be mad even if we were not close. I said that he still loved her, but I let the conversation drop after that as I didn\u2019t see what else I could say to mend their relationship other than downplaying what ex did (which would feel like lying, since I\u2019m still incredibly hurt over what happened).\n\nThat was not good enough and ex has called me a vindictive bitch over the situation and accused me of using a kid to get back at him. Hannah is also upset because she had also become close to niece as part of my friend group, but now niece is acting extremely cold to her. They both think I should stop talking to niece altogether because I'm obviously \"poisoning\" her against them.\n\nNiece\u2019s parents say I\u2019m in the clear, and niece\u2019s mom has confided that she\u2019d rather I stay in her daughter\u2019s life over ex. But I can tell ex is hurting over this as he really does love niece.
