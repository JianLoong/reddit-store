It\u2019s unfortunate that she has that history, and I feel for her, but I agree with what your bf said - her past doesn\u2019t excuse the present behavior, especially because the two things aren\u2019t even related (i.e., being mean to your bf now and her history with the Other Guy). She was being shitty to your boyfriend, and you called her out. If you had no knowledge of what happened to her, I just don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. But Anna is - there was no call for making repeated remarks like she did. I actually think your comment, while it ended up being hurtful to her, may have been on the money. Why would she be pushing on that, pushing on the idea that you should dump your bf, if she didn\u2019t have intentions towards him? It\u2019s either that, or she was just taking shots at him for the hell of it, and that sucks too.", "Anna was the asshole from the get-go.

At that point if you didn't say something I'd say you were being the asshole to yourself and your bf.", "NTA It sounds like she was abusive to your bf and considering she was still being rude to him, it wasn\u2019t out of line, even given what happened afterwards.", "NTA You should apologize, but he acted like a jerk, just say something like: I was angry but didn\u2019t know that happened.

However, it's understandable that your words hurt her deeply. It's commendable that you feel remorse and want to make amends. Apologizing to Anna could be a good step, as it shows empathy and a willingness to take responsibility for unintentionally causing harm. Consider reaching out to her, expressing your genuine apologies, and being open to listen if she wants to talk about her feelings.", "NTA you didn't know, there was no reasonable expectation that your comment would bring up trauma & you clearly wouldn't have done it if you had known. It was a reasonable response to her behaviour \n\nI wouldn't apologise because then she'll know for sure that you know about the abuse & I doubt being pitied by her ex's partner will make her feel better. \n\nMay explain why your bf has such a forgiving relationship with his cheating ex though", "NTA, but now you know not to bring it up again.  Plenty of other ways to retaliate if she tries to mess with your relationship again, just not this one.\n\nWe live and we learn.", "NTA\n\nI think that Anna's reaction has less to do with her abusive relationship and more to do with the fact that you were spot on that she was regretting her actions when she was with Jim, her entire line of comments were about splitting the two of you up so that 'hopefully' she could get back with Jim and you called her out on it.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know and from the outside you were defending your boyfriend and relationship.

Anna was clearly out of line.\n\nThat said, I think ESH - because your comment did go a step too far regardless - you could have held a boundary rather than go on the offensive, something along the lines of \"Anna, you keep making fun of Jim, and I don't like it. Please stop - if you don't we're going to leave or ask you to leave. It's insulting to him, and insulting to me. I love him, and I'm choosing to be with him, and him with me.

Otherwise it seems very weird to make comments about him when she cheated and they've clearly somehow made up at least enough to be friends.", "I was thinking the same. She never acted like this before, so the whole thing was pretty out of the blue. Maybe something happened in her private life that made her reconsider her past (unfortunate) choices. But we are not that close and at this point I don't think she will open up to my bf either. They are friends but not that close anyway.\n\nI hope she gets better.

He wasn't rating by numbers, but what I wrote was the best translation I could come up with of what he actually said.

Her history with the other guy means nothing.", "nta , at that moment she was the abuser!!!! dont feel guilty for a second.. yeah it sucks she went trought that but she should know better than to belittle and abuse someone else, she knows how bad it feels!", "NTA. Your bf is right. Abuse, mental health disorders, etc are no excuse to act like a bag of dicks. Anna comes across like she regrets her actions. That\u2019s a her problem. It becomes a you problem if/when she crosses boundaries regarding your relationship. \n\nI\u2019d defer to your bf on this one for now. Let her run her mouth, you focus on your relationship. She\u2019s upset she fucked up, that\u2019s all.", "NTA as she deserved something, but this is where it's always important to recognize how powerful our words can be when we have incomplete information about someoen else.\n\nAnna was clearly making some sort of weird attempt to make a gap between you and your bf which deserved a response.  You could not have known what happened to her, but likely did cause her some hurt (on multiple levels so as an rebuttal to her attacks, very effective on your part).\n\nThe best time of her life was probably with your bf and hopefully it is also your best time.
