Having a bad day does not excuse the fact that she basically called op's bf ugly the entire time they hung out...idk about y'all but calling people ugly is not a normal part of having a bad day. \n\nAnd she did this for what? Probably because she wants to bring him down and keep him at her level. When she was smacked in the face with op's hard truth (that she is a jealous cheater) she felt bad.

His comment was 1) not the only thing he said greeting us, but that was the important part for the story; 2) given our history and inside jokes, not out of line - he and my bf always mock each other about basically everything, but always in a healthy way, it's kind of their thing.\n\nAbout Anna, as I said we don't meet her often (maybe once a year or so) and we are not in contact with her, but when we bump into each other (we live in a small city, so it might happen) we are friendly with her given her history with bf. She never acted like this before, so we had no reason to avoid her. But I'm afraid this will change now.", "Thank you. To answer your question:\n\n1) I only know what my bf told me, I am not close with her and I didn't ask for further detail bc I didn't want to snoop in a story that is none of my business. But I know I can trust what he said, not only bc he had no reason to lie to me, but also bc he told me they were in contact for some time and she reached out to him asking for help at some point.\n\n2) She never acted this way before, I have already met her before and though she might have strong opinions about certain topics, she never gave abusive/bullying vibes to me. Maybe it's just poor judgement on my side, but not to brag, I am usually quite good in detecting red flags.", "Tbh, I don't know why she acted this way. As I said before, maybe something happened in her private life that brought up some memories. Maybe she needed attention and she hasn't learned to express it properly. I don't know her that well, the only thing I can say about it is that she usually doesn't act this way.", "Even if OP *did* know, a comment to shut her up was warranted, it just should have been that didn't reference her abuser.\n\n\nLike, the shutting her up was good, the only thing to avoid would have been the abusive relationship.", "You are a good person. \n\nI myself have been damaged enough to be a bad person to good people, and have been around bad people that made me worse. It has taken decades of therapy and medication to make me \u201cbetter\u201d. \n\nYou want to believe she is good but she was being mean. Really mean. If my cheating ex came at my current love of my life asking them to break up with me, and because I know they are mean, I would be thrilled at what you said. \n\nYou were actually extremely decent to a person who has proven unkind. Give your nice bf a hug from me. He was the one abused today.", "Yes she is.", "I do know that sometimes women like a challenge, so you becoming more attractive while being with your bf could be like a beacon for her to try and steal him away from you. It\u2019s like a badge of honour for some people, \u201cHe chose me over his/her super attractive partner\u201d type of thing. Idk the girl though, so maybe I\u2019m wrong. But it\u2019s the first thing I thought of considering you said her behaviour is out of place.", "She literally didn't know", "No one would know about the abuse if she didnt tell everyone. She didnt have to, but she also cant expect others to not call her out on her cheating on OPs boyfriend. Her situation sucked, she also sucked for cheating. Op only commented on cheating, not abuse.", "> not only bc he had no reason to lie to me\n\nI was never insinuating that *he lied* to you - I thought maybe he had been lied to.\n\nThe stuff that was quoted above is definitely worthy of abuse/bullying vibes.", " \nI\u2019m sure it was for some people. For many others though, I don\u2019t think so", "They also don't cheat in the first place", "Eh, it takes more than a bad day to cheat on your SO. And I'm struggling to see what bad day would cause you to insult and/or breakup your ex and your ex's new partner, when you cheated on ex.\n\nLady made a bad decision and paid highly for it. That sucks. It probably hurt for her to see the cost of that bad decision, and she was trying to make it hurt less by trying to encourage the new girlfriend to be just as awful as herself.\n\nDunno if she is a bad person or not, though the evidence points in one direction. I can say she is someone who makes bad decisions and handles the fallout badly, rather than take responsibility for her actions and deals with it in a healthy manner.", "Good people can also have bad behavior sometimes. Doesn\u2019t immediately make them bad.. just people. We all have done or said things we wish we didn\u2019t but we are flawed. Continuing bad behavior could make a bad person out of a good one.", "But... but she's an aBuSe ViCtIm", "Not sure about the commenter you're responding to, but in most african countries its still very popular", "Not everything is as black and white as \"good people don't cheat\". There are a myriad of ways to be considered \"good\". Don't get me wrong I'm firmly in Camp \"Cheaters Should Die\" having been cheated on myself, but even then. My ex who cheated on me has a kid with my best friend now and they're more than likely going to get married. She and I were together 10 years ago. People grow up and change.", ">Not everything is as black and white as \"good people don't cheat\". There are a myriad of ways to be considered \"good\".\n\nWhat are you saying here, exactly?

Why should you feel bad about something you didn't know about. Makes no sense.", "NTA. What\u2019s the expression - play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Or another - f around and find out.

How would you feel if the situation were reversed and someone joked about him being so much more attractive and he just laughed it off?", "INFO: the comments bothered you, why didn't you just asked her what the comments are about? Like \"anne, all the joking beside, what are these comments you made all evening really about? Do you think jim and i are not happy together or shouldn't be together? And if you think so, why did you come to this conclusion?\" \n\nEither she would have been honest and say she wants to have jim back (and you know what you are dealing with here) or she would have denied and the comments would have pretty much stopped. \n\nIs there a reason you decided to lower yourself to her level of communication?", "Nta. You didn't make a joke about abuse, and you didn't know she was a victim of abuse.

That's what cheaters do.", "Yeah I can see how it might be a hurtful comment but pretty shitty of her to make jabs at your bf. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it, especially if you don\u2019t see her often. But I guess for future, I\u2019d go with calling her out by playing dumb and asking her to elaborate on what she means.

What I meant:\n\nEvery kind of abuse is horrible and must be punished. That being said, if her abuser was physical, chances are she wouldn't even survive to him. She is a very thin and delicate girl, and this guy (I once saw a picture of them) was massive, typical \"always at the gym\" kind of person.\n\nWhat happened to her is horrible and nothing will ever change that. But, at least, she survived it and has a chance to heal. Many victims don't get that chance.\n\nI'm sorry if I didn't explain myself better.", "Thank you for your comment! To clarify your doubts:\n\n- I think my man did nothing wrong, not just bc I love him, but this was not his story to tell and none of my business, so he had no reason to tell me before all of this happened. She never acted in such an unpleasant way, so he never felt the need to warn me about this particular \"no-fly zone\". He apologised to me for not telling me this before, though.\n\n- We all live in a quite small city, so bumping into people is not that uncommon. It happened before and it will probably happen again, especially if you go for drinks in the city centre on a saturday night, basically everyone is there. Plus, Mark knows very well that we are friendly with Anna (even if we are not that close) and being the social person he is, he saw no issues in inviting her to join us. He even asked before inviting her and we said yes, so I see no wrong from him.", "Thank you for your feedback, and I'm sorry for what happened to you. I hope things are better for you now.\n\nSurely there is more, but it's none of my business unless Anna decides to share it with me. I think my bf did nothing wrong, he had no reason to tell me about her story - it's not *his* story to tell.\n\nI understand your point of view and I'll try to do better if I happen again to be in this situation.", "Of course I did. When Mark made his joke, we all laughed bc it was not out of line (as I explained better in other comments, both mark and my bf mock each other about their looks, and none of them is bothered by it - in this particular situation, it all started bc they are both losing hair and they were joking about that).\n\nMy bf very well knows that even if he is not the stereotypical hot guy, I love him and like him the way he is and I am attracted to him. Tbh I don't think that I am more attractive than him, and neither does he. I made sure to say that to Anne, too.\n\nMy bf was not uncomfortable for the comments about his look, what really set him off was the implications that we should break up.", "Thank you for this feedback!\n\nFirst of all, I didn't jump to \"full attack\" right away: my response was the last of many attempts to cool down the situation. At first I tried with jokes, then with more serious responses, but always being friendly. I even openly asked her to stop making comments, and Mark backed me up too. But nothing worked.\n\nAs long as what you wrote might have been the more appropriate response, I honestly didn't think about that, I was pretty annoyed at that point. Plus, we are friendly, but not that close: a question like that would have required her to open up in a way that would have made everyone uncomfortable.\n\nI realize I didn't react in the best way. I'll try to do better if it happens again.", "That would be a very weird assumption for a couple of 9 years. At some point, you speak about past relationships and why they didn't work. It speaks volumes that Jim didn't disclose that part of Anna's story - it didn't involve or affect him and OP, so he's either trustworthy, not a vengeful person, or both.", "Seems like a classic case of someone who likes to dish it out but can\u2019t take it. It\u2019s good you said something", "Maybe that was a trigger in some way. Your friend  said he noticed your gains, in case gym was mentioned or something related to that and abuse she suffered was of putting down kind, it could have made her brain spiral into panic.\n\nJust a theory. \n\nNot to out yourself that you already know about what happened to her, you could ask her if she's willing to meet and speak to you about what happened that night in a bar.", "You\u2019re still NTA like your frustration just built up which happens to everyone, I still think if you\u2019d been in a relationship nine years after he was in a five year relationship he could\u2019ve explained better at some point that she wasn\u2019t just a cheater and could\u2019ve been getting abused by that guy while she was with your ex", "Your bf lmao so sorry I said ex, I\u2019m not insinuating I just got mixed up!", "Thank you :) he taught me so much over these years and he truly is a blessing in my life. I always try to be my best self, but sometimes, like in this situation, I find it hard to do. You can throw anything at me and I won't budge, but leave my bf out of that.", "Oh, sorry if it sounded like I was offended by your comment, it was not my intention.\n\nI don't think Anna lied about the abuse. I looked Other Guy up and based on his social media posts, he's very controlling and likes to be the \"alpha intimidating kind of man\". So the fact that he is abusive checks quite well for me.\n\nBack to Anna, yes, the way she acted in this specific situation was very bullying, and honestly caught me off guard, I really didn't expect it.", "Thanks for your suggestion. Very on point. I'm thinking about reaching out to talk, but we're not close and I'm worried it might be awkward on my side to reach out like that. But I'll consider it.", "Also been cheated on but I do agree. We're humans just trying to navigate relationships of all types and dynamics and situations. We won't also be in healthy and stable mindsets to self inspect and think clearly even for long periods of time. We will gwt into situations where we've never had to deal with what we're feeling or what's going on and that doesn't mean we will always make the right choices.  Some people go into a relationship with the intent to never be loyal, those ones are definitely more questionable. But someone cheating isn't immediately able to blacken someone's entire moral being.", "It's not hard to comprehend what I'm saying, really.\n\nA cheater isn't inherently a bad person through and through. They made a mistake, and I'm not advocating for cheating at all, but the girl who cheated on me isn't a bad person. She's a good mother, a good partner to my best friend and actually quite a good friend of mine now. Young people make mistakes. People make mistakes. Some are a lot easier to forgive than others, some are unforgivable, but don't completely write somebody off as a monster because of it.", ">A cheater isn't inherently a bad person through and through. They made a mistake\n\nIt's rare for cheating to be just 'a mistake'. Maybe in the case of a stray, singular kiss? In that rare case scenario sure, you're right, one mistake does not a bad person make. \n\nCheating beyond a singular incident or taking one act and having it escalate into more is not just 'a mistake', it is a series of conscious decisions that, taken all together, do make a cheater a bad person in my book. \n\nThere has to be a line drawn somewhere at the number/frequency/diversity of 'mistakes' someone makes, otherwise 'good' remains merely a philosophical concept and not a human reality - and then anyone can use your same argument about net positive goodness to excuse/explain away much worse things than cheating. \n\nIf someone cheats enough to be called 'a cheater' (which is a term you've branded your ex with) i don't see how they could be a good person, regardless of how good they are in other areas of their life, because cheating reveals one's moral character."]}
