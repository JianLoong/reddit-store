You could afford much prettier men\"\n\nWhat's wrong with this woman so blatantly trying to break you guys up? Did she actually think if she insisted enough you would agree with her and find a much \"prettier man\"? Given the cheatong history HER comments were extremely hurtful towards your bf and your couple, she's the one who needs to apologize. Don't overthink it you owe her nothing!!", "Honestly, NTA. It\u2019s unfortunate that she has that history, and I feel for her, but I agree with what your bf said - her past doesn\u2019t excuse the present behavior, especially because the two things aren\u2019t even related (i.e., being mean to your bf now and her history with the Other Guy). She was being shitty to your boyfriend, and you called her out. If you had no knowledge of what happened to her, I just don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. But Anna is - there was no call for making repeated remarks like she did. I actually think your comment, while it ended up being hurtful to her, may have been on the money. Why would she be pushing on that, pushing on the idea that you should dump your bf, if she didn\u2019t have intentions towards him? It\u2019s either that, or she was just taking shots at him for the hell of it, and that sucks too.", "Anna was the asshole from the get-go. What goes around comes around, maybe if she wasn't an asshole to begin with, then there wouldn't be anything to be upset about in the first place. It's hard for me to feel empathy towards her, since she cheated on him and after said abusive relationship still remained an obnoxious asshole. NTA", "NTA. She pushed it way too far. The first comment could be played off as a joke, the rest were beating a dead horse. The fact that she purposefully made your bf uncomfortable and kept it going was rude and cruel. At that point if you didn't say something I'd say you were being the asshole to yourself and your bf.", "NTA It sounds like she was abusive to your bf and considering she was still being rude to him, it wasn\u2019t out of line, even given what happened afterwards.", "NTA You should apologize, but he acted like a jerk, just say something like: I was angry but didn\u2019t know that happened. But make her understand you\u2019re not comfortable with her being that jerk", "NTA. It was an honest mistake because you didn't know what had happened to Anna until after the fact. You can certainly apologize if it'll make you feel better.\n\nI think it was more a situation where Anna was just being immature and saying stupid things to try to goad you into a jealous response, and it backfired on her big time.", "NTA\n\nit's not your job to know Anna's sob story. She cheated on your bf and now she wants to mock him. Plus, \"Mark\" also sounds like a complete dick. Men rating women in numbers is never a good sign for anything.

She's the cheater", "NTA \n\nIt seems like you didn't have prior knowledge of Anna's past with an abusive relationship, so your comment was unintentional. However, it's understandable that your words hurt her deeply. It's commendable that you feel remorse and want to make amends. Apologizing to Anna could be a good step, as it shows empathy and a willingness to take responsibility for unintentionally causing harm. Consider reaching out to her, expressing your genuine apologies, and being open to listen if she wants to talk about her feelings.", "NTA you didn't know, there was no reasonable expectation that your comment would bring up trauma & you clearly wouldn't have done it if you had known. It was a reasonable response to her behaviour \n\nI wouldn't apologise because then she'll know for sure that you know about the abuse & I doubt being pitied by her ex's partner will make her feel better. \n\nMay explain why your bf has such a forgiving relationship with his cheating ex though", "NTA, but now you know not to bring it up again.  Plenty of other ways to retaliate if she tries to mess with your relationship again, just not this one.\n\nWe live and we learn.", "NTA\n\nI think that Anna's reaction has less to do with her abusive relationship and more to do with the fact that you were spot on that she was regretting her actions when she was with Jim, her entire line of comments were about splitting the two of you up so that 'hopefully' she could get back with Jim and you called her out on it.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know and from the outside you were defending your boyfriend and relationship. I would\u2019ve been less polite probably.\n\nWhat happened to her was unfortunate, but that doesn\u2019t decide any and all rude behaviour.", "NTA first you did it unknowingly second she was being a jerk, third you were speaking the truth", "What you didn't and shouldn't have known can't be held against you. Anna was clearly out of line.\n\nThat said, I think ESH - because your comment did go a step too far regardless - you could have held a boundary rather than go on the offensive, something along the lines of \"Anna, you keep making fun of Jim, and I don't like it. Please stop - if you don't we're going to leave or ask you to leave. It's insulting to him, and insulting to me. I love him, and I'm choosing to be with him, and him with me. Your opinion of our looks doesn't matter a lick, so keep it to yourself.\"", "Exactly. Bad stuff in the past is not a free pass to be a jerk. \n\nI\u2019m a bit salty because I\u2019ve had people try to make me ignore actual bullying or apologize for something I didn\u2019t do to make the \u201cvictim\u201d feel better.", "I'm wondering if Anna maybe assumed the bf hadn't mentioned the cheating to OP. Otherwise it seems very weird to make comments about him when she cheated and they've clearly somehow made up at least enough to be friends.", "I was thinking the same. She never acted like this before, so the whole thing was pretty out of the blue. Maybe something happened in her private life that made her reconsider her past (unfortunate) choices. But we are not that close and at this point I don't think she will open up to my bf either. They are friends but not that close anyway.\n\nI hope she gets better. She's not a bad person.", "IF OP is NTA, then she has nothing to apologize for.  Anna was acting like a jerk and got her comeuppance.", "I agree, and I'm not a gossip person, I never asked before bc it was none of my business.\n\nIn defense of Mark, he's a lovely guy and we all know each other (me, my bf amd him) since we were kids and we built our own inside jokes and humour in all these years. He wasn't rating by numbers, but what I wrote was the best translation I could come up with of what he actually said. Given our history that comment was absolutely not out of line, and no one was offended by it (bf included). In fact, the two of them always mock each other for not being supermodels, but never in a mean way.", "So basically you defend the cheater and an abuser given how she was going out of her way to belittle Op's BF", "Yeah, maybe so. I agree that it\u2019s really odd (and inappropriate) behavior from Anna."]}
