To me thats just blatantly stating to the world you're racist. \n\nWe see my aunt maybe twice per year (I'm 32), we basically have no relationship other than her commenting on stuff on Facebook (I post maybe 8x per year?). She's never even seen my 14 month old sons face as I don't post it on Facebook and she's never seen him in person. So yeah, very little interaction. \n\nIm not going to lie. I didnt much like her prior to seeing her reveal her racist tendancies. She treated my grandma like shit when she was alive, now shes dead she calls her her sweet angel every aniverary, mothers day, christmas you name it. She treats my dad like a cash machine if she can get away with it. She's always posting 'controversial' stuff about sensitive issues. So maybe I've been waiting for a reason to delete her. \n\nAnyways, back to the AITA, my dad found out I had deleted his sister. Asked why. I stated she shared racist imagery. Then ensured a long discussion about how it was a nostalgic toy, they didn't know any different, it was cultural, part of their childhood bla bla. I just said...even if it was part of your childhood, we know better now, its offensive to alot of people. I think she's sharing it to be controversial. I'm tired of seeing negative nasty shit on Facebook. So I deleted her. So now my dads implying I'm the asshole basically as you shouldn't delete family off Facebook and how will we ever keep in contact and 'it wasn't racist anyway!' And some shit about a jam reference and the doll. I also avoided seeing her when she visited yesterday. \n\nSo...AITA? Am I overreacting? Is she the offensive AH I think she is or is it just her childhood nostalgia and noone would be that bothered?", "created_utc": 1667244336, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yim36r/aita_for_deleting_my_aunt_on_facebooknot_seeing/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Regardless of whether she knew or not, you're a grown woman and your dad has no business telling you who you should allow on your Facebook or even noticing or commenting.

There's no reason why you have to deal with people disturbing your peace with their problematic behavior.", "Nta. She knew it wasn't just \"childhood nostalgia\" otherwise why post with a \"let's see how long this will stay up before fb deletes it\" - that right there says it's potentially offensive and she posted it for that reason.
