I know I'm gonna get deleted for saying this because it is breaking the rules. So many of you are calling this fake and the fact is, it's not. It is real but it happened in 1999 to my older sister. This is a story my mom boasts about to party guests. I tried staying as close to what she recounts as well as my my sister's side of the story. My mom is proud of what she said, calling it her crowning acheivement of motherhood, and she is as vile as you say. I'm sorry for lying and causing so much anger. I'm just trying to process a lot of the pain she caused us. My sister has always been amazingly hard working and she's a wonderful mother now.]\n\nI have a 19 year old daughter, the second oldest of 5 still living at home. I don't force her to do much but sometimes I would like for her to do pull some of her weight around the house and help out.\n\nLast night I was invited out by my girlfriends to a halloween party so I asked my daughter to take her little siblings trick or treating. Not that big of a deal but apparently that was too much for her. She told me that she had plans to go to a halloween party with her friends that night and didn't think it was fair to suddenly drop this on her. \n\nWell I didn't see it that way. she doesn't pay rent. Sure she goes to college but she can make time for her siblings sometimes. I tried explaining that to her but this all became a huge fight. She crossed the line and told me that if I didn't want to watch my chilren than I shouldn't have had so many.\n\nI was livid. I told her that she was right and I should have stopped at one. At which point she started crying and stormed up to her room. I thought it was important to set firm rules so I yelled up and told her that if she doesn't take her siblings trick or treating then she's grounded. I left for the halloween party not long after and she did take her siblings trick or treating. \n\nNow it's the next day and she's refusing to talk to me. My husband is saying I was too harsh. which, sure I could have held back on that comment but I'm not ruining her life by having her prioritize her siblings. what about me? Am I not allowed to have any fun?

This is sickening and I don't know that I would ever be able to forgive such a heinous comment from a parent - nor if I would try to.

I don't force her to do much but sometimes I would like for her to do pull some of her weight around the house and help out.\n\nLast night I was invited out by my girlfriends to a halloween party so I asked my daughter to take her little siblings trick or treating. Not that big of a deal but apparently that was too much for her. She told me that she had plans to go to a halloween party with her friends that night and didn't think it was fair to suddenly drop this on her. \n\nWell I didn't see it that way. she doesn't pay rent. Sure she goes to college but she can make time for her siblings sometimes. I tried explaining that to her but this all became a huge fight. She crossed the line and told me that if I didn't want to watch my chilren than I shouldn't have had so many.\n\nI was livid. I told her that she was right and I should have stopped at one. At which point she started crying and stormed up to her room. I thought it was important to set firm rules so I yelled up and told her that if she doesn't take her siblings trick or treating then she's grounded. I left for the halloween party not long after and she did take her siblings trick or treating. \n\nNow it's the next day and she's refusing to talk to me. My husband is saying I was too harsh. which, sure I could have held back on that comment but I'm not ruining her life by having her prioritize her siblings. what about me?
