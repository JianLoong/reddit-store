I'm sensing an undiagnosed but very serious case of anxiety or other mental illness that will continue to cause issues for her.", "NTA She needs to see a competent mental health professional soon. She\u2019s paranoid, drinking more, and refusing help, all while ignoring the problem.\n\nDon\u2019t marry her until she\u2019s getting mental health help on her own, and you\u2019ve made sure that she won\u2019t hide money issues from you.

It's harsh, but I'd say that I wouldn't be willing to marry her until this debt is paid off, whether by your parents (who are very generous in their offer) or by her herself. You don't want to take on that debt and I don't blame you. If this is affecting her this much, it's definitely a concern for her mental well-being as well. Has she seen a therapist?

That is a more serious concern and should probably be considered and dealt with accordingly.", "NTA, but I think simply getting the debt paid thru your parents would just be a band-aid on top of deeper, unresolved issues. Thank your parents for the offer, but don\u2019t let them help (at least for now). Between the taxes, the irrational avoidance of said taxes, the drinking, and the panic attacks, your GF has some stuff to sort out. She should probably start seeing a therapist pronto, and if you want to work through this together and continue the relationship (especially if marriage is still on the table), you may want to try some joint therapy as a couple as well.

I would be pushing hard to go visit a CPA (together) who can tell her what her options are for paying off the debt and the reality of what putting off payment will mean (racking up penalties and interest that can double her tax bill or worse). The CPA can also give a realistic assessment of the likelihood of criminal penalties and seizure of her assets. Then armed with the facts, instead a lot of conjecture, you can assess whether she also has a mental health issue that needs to be addressed pronto.\n\nETA: I forgot about the drinking when I  wrote this. She definitely has a mental health issue for which she is self-medicating. Get that looked at pronto too!", "NTA! You really need to reconsider this relationship.

What other things is she regularly avoiding? and why are you enabling the behavior.", "NTA, although just saying to get over herself won't actually help her in her situation. It sounds like she has symptoms that are close to depression. The avoidance style and drinking to cope means that she's definitely struggling with something.

I want to solve the problem but it's like there's a wall there,  blocking me from doing anything about it. \nI know everyone in here always suggests therapy,  but I think individual therapy for her and couples therapy for both of you would really, really help get to the bottom of things.  Please consider it.", "Intervention time. They will garnish (think that\u2019s the right word) her wages and eventually will prosecute for tax evasion.

Why can't you offer to pay off her debt instead of taking money from your parents?", "NTA. You and your girlfriend need to figure this out before any more talks of marriage happen. Something is very wrong here if she owes the government that much for 3 years of taxes. She might need therapy or financial education. \n\nThe most logical thing here would be to tell her your parents will pay off her debt as a loan and she can pay them back over time (or not, since it sounds like your parents don't need the money). It would be much better for her to owe your parents than to owe the government.", "I feel her, really do. As I have autism, my worst nightmare is stuff like that.\n\nThere is a thing called \"ADHD tax\" that is about how much money you lose as you forget/are too anxious to deal with cancelling subscriptions, doing taxes, returning damaged items, etc.\n\nNot to say that your gf is neurodivergent or anything. I do have empathy for her anxiousness.\n\nThat being said, the only thing that will stop her feeling anxious and embarrased is actually doing the thing. So be gentle but put your foot down: the taxes do need to be deal with. \n\nBut most of all, if being anxious is her problem, dont step aside, keep being involved till she deals with it. Do not infantilize her either. Dont turn a enemy (treat is like an issue you should support her, not as a source of a fight)\n\nYou are already right in the facts.", "NTA but there will probably be a gift tax for the money they give her. Its a neverending cycle. My understanding is once they see you are non-compliant they keep an eye on you. \n\nI would seriously reconsider tying your finances to hers.

It is obviously causing some mental health issues that are becoming more and more a bigger problem.  She's drinking, and having a lot of paranoia.

She may then need a tax lawyer to negotiate how much she owes after the withheld amount is accounted for - she may be able to get the failure to file penalties waived once the returns are submitted. Or she can contact a local IRS office and ask for a mediator (I think that\u2019s what they are called?). I had a situation a few years back where I was getting letters from the IRS saying I hadn\u2019t filed when I actually had. I sent them copies with a new signature, same thing happened. The amount I owed was increasing at an alarming rate, so I went to the IRS office and asked for help figuring out what was going on. He was really nice, quickly figured out that I had made an error on the sale of a condo that went in the IRS\u2019s favor. He was upset that it was something so obvious and had I been told what the actual issue was the fix was simple. I ended up with sizable refund, and penalties were waived since I had indeed filed on time.  \n\nYour girlfriend will not be arrested for walking into H&R Block or something similar and asking for help. The real issue is why didn\u2019t she file in the first place and why she is torturing herself instead of just dealing with it.", "Young people also are more likely to have untraditional employment with self withholdings and no real employer withholders of old", "It's also possible she does freelance work, in which case she would be responsible for taking taxes out. I've been in this situation and am currently paying back years of taxes. If she doesn't want OP's parents money, she can file her taxes and set up a payment plan with the IRS, the fact that she's refusing to do anything other than drink and be paranoid is kind of a red flag here.", "Not just penalties but interest at a high rate, compounded daily. After 3 years the actual tax owed is probably a small portion of the bill. And the total can usually be negotiated, but that involves taking ownership and actually communicating with the IRS (and filing tax returns). For which she clearly needs expert help.", "Ah I didn't know that nuance re: withholdings basically being in escrow. So it sounds like OP's girlfriend is likely not in as much financial trouble as she thinks barring any of the other possible problems being true.", "Hadn't considered that as I had regular employment starting in college ~10 years ago but I suppose that is true.", "yeah, i get the \"i don't want to adult.\" heck, I have friends that are almost 40 who have to file for an extension every year for their taxes. their taxes aren't involved- they're just scared of them so they put them off. (can't say i wouldn't have done that if i'd known it was an option at 25.)\n\nbut being scared and ignoring it doesn't solve it.\n\non the other hand, this is really not OP's problem and I'd be concerned what this says about how GF handles (or will handle) other problems that come up.", "I think so, assuming she had a job where taxes were withheld. If she was a 1099 employee and should have been filing quarterly, she could very well owe a lot of money.", "Yeah i been hearing about so many under 25s with untraditional jobs get pikachu shock face when they learnt they had to pay taxes.  Pay it on time.  Pay it quarterly if not every paycheck.  And easily rack up over 10k in irs debt \n\nAt first it shocked me but now im just meh young people", "one of my cousins first real jobs was basically an assistant to a real estate broker in NYC. it was a 1099 job and you really have to do quarterly taxes with that sort of job.\n\nher first tax bill? she was shocked. (her parents were able to step in to help.)\n\nalso the reason, everyone else in our generation knows what to expect in that situation."]}
