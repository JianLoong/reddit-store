James is gross. Your friends are right its insecurity but that isn't an excuse for shit behaviour.

Sometimes it can be strategically better to side-step (e.g. , \"I'm asexual\" or \"I'm depressed and can't get into a relationship\" or \"I'm concentrating on getting a promotion\", whatever)... or to have someone else in the friend group do the talking on your behalf (\"Dude, we have noticed that you are obsessing on her and it is making the rest of us uncomfortable.\")", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Asian people are constantly stereotyped as being short, bad drivers, having small penises, etc. just as British people are stereotyped as having terrible teeth, being loud obnoxious drunks, only eating bland food, etc. Stereotypes in any form suck, but some are much worse than others. You still don't seem to understand that just because something is a \"running joke\" doesn't mean it isn't racist. You can make all the excuses you want, but it won't change the reality that what you said was offensive. I'm 40 myself so your age also isn't an excuse."]}
