Just because someone\u2019s insecure doesn\u2019t give them a right to lie about you. Especially about something as serious as racism.\n\nI\u2019d set boundaries now and make it clear that this isn\u2019t acceptable. Hopefully James will reflect and grow up off the back of it, so you\u2019ll actually be doing him a favour.", "Absolutely YWNBTA.\n\nFirst off, calling someone something such as racist csn be extremely serious allegations, especially if it reaches outside the friend group. If you dont address it, it could get worse. It's almost like a ticking time bomb. He needs that wake up call.", "How entitled is James, everyone who refuses to go out with him is racist? Wtf?", "NTA. Sounds like your friend group understand you're not a racist, but they need to go further than that and not simply excuse his poor behavior.", "NTA, and yes, if he's saying 'you're racist' to anyone who will listen - and not just your friends who understand - this is a serious allegation, I would definitely confront James about it.", "Ew. James is gross. Your friends are right its insecurity but that isn't an excuse for shit behaviour. A huge red flag - never date this guy lol!\n\nYou give him an explination about why you don't want to date him and I guarantee he will attribute whatever judgement you make as racist. It's just more feul to the fire.\n\nGo with: Hey I heard that you were calling me racist because I don't want to date you. Thats not true right, because it's making me feel incredibly uncomfortable.\n\nThen if he persists. There are plenty of people who I like as good friends, who I would never date because our personalities don't mesh in that way or the chemistry isn't there. Stop telling our friends that I am racist.", "You are NTA, but tbh your friends are for not shutting him down immediately. If I found out someone said that about me to my friends, especially for such superficial reasons, and they didn\u2019t shut it down, I\u2019d be seriously reevaluating these friendships. \n\nThe fact that they are defending his actions because \u201ehe\u2019s insecure and his ego is hurt\u201c is also deeply misogynistic of your friends and they deserve to be called out for that.", "Yeah he should have consequences for him saying dumb, untrue things about you but will it accomplish anything? Will he change after it\u2019s addressed or will he only create more of a reason to feel like the victim? Right now your friends are 100% on your side, if you say the wrong thing when confronting him that could change.", "NTA. There's no need to spell it out; if you're not attracted to him it doesn't equate to being racist. People like that are annoying. You date those you're attracted to. Racism doesn't enter into it.", "NTA. He is not entitled to date you (or anyone else). His behaviour is incel-ish .   \n\n\nBut at the same time, you need to strategically assess whether being blunt with him would be productively corrective (something that he would listen to and take seriously and learn to do better); or if it would anger him and damage the friend group; or if he would be likely to react by becoming focused on blaming you, hassling you for months and months. Sometimes it can be strategically better to side-step (e.g. , \"I'm asexual\" or \"I'm depressed and can't get into a relationship\" or \"I'm concentrating on getting a promotion\", whatever)... or to have someone else in the friend group do the talking on your behalf (\"Dude, we have noticed that you are obsessing on her and it is making the rest of us uncomfortable.\")", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
