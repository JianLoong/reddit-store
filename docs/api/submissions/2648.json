It is a pretty spacious place where I had lived for most of my life until my mom and I moved in with my stepfather. This summer, I moved back to that apartment where now my aunt, her boyfriend and two of her sons lived, 23m and 15m. It\u2019s my family home, I am registered in this apartment and considered a \u201cpart-owner\u201d (not sure how to explain that correctly).\n\nNow, my aunt broke up with her boyfriend and moved in with another man, so she no longer lives here. My cousin P (23m) has a girlfriend A (f18) living with him here. I have my own room, they live in the biggest room and my younger brother has his own room as well (he did not move out to live with his mother). \n\nSo, to the issue: a month ago, I asked my aunt how much I was supposed to pay. She gave me the number and I was surprised because she split the bill in three, not four, like I had expected. I paid that amount though hoping to resolve that issue later. \n\nYesterday, A texted me that I had to send her the money cause they were paying that monthly bill (they are paying from her bank account). It was the same amount as the month before and I got frustrated \u2014 clearly, my aunt still didn\u2019t think that A had to pay for living here. My aunt was actually over, so I went up to her asking to elaborate which resulted in a huge fight. She said that since A was not \u201cregistered\u201d in the apartment like the rest of us, she didn\u2019t have to pay. She also called me an asshole for bringing up the subject and refusing to pay the amount she had requested. \n\nI ended up paying that once again, but then received a message from aunt which said that she had split the bill in four and from now on she\u2019ll expect the money in her account every 15th of each month. NOTE: We are not paying off any mortgage for that apartment, it\u2019s been in our family possession for many years. Those are just monthly bills (a tax, electricity, water). \n\nSo, am I the asshole for refusing to pay?", "created_utc": 1668775421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyj7ep/aitah_for_refusing_to_pay_more_for_the_apartment/", "score": 76, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why is the 18 yr old girlfriend taking it over? This all sounds shady. NTA, and you all need to sit down and figure this out together.", "NTA\n\nThe bills should be split evenly between the people living there. Anyone who is living there and isn't a \u201cpart-owner\u201d as you put it should not just be paying their portion of the utility bills but should be paying rent which is then split between the people who are \u201cpart-owner\u201d .", "A little bit confusing, but it sounds like the funds are not for mortgage/rent but for utilities and taxes.

Regardless of who is \"registered\" in the apartment, the living costs should be divided equally amongst all who are living there.

Maybe you all need to sit down and discuss numbers.   And ask to see the bills and what the exact numbers are.  If someone is living there full time, registered or not, she still uses electricity and water.  She doesn't earn a free ride.  Something doesnt seem on the up and up, and you have every right to see where the money is going, and how much everything costs.", "NTA and I would bet that Aunt is paying 1/4 of the bills on behalf of A.
