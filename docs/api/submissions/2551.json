Do you even KNOW how grief works?  EVERYTHING NORMAL gets thrown out the grief feeling window.  NOT BY CHOICE, but when your DAD passes away you do NOT get over it and return to normal in two days.  It just doesn't happen.  Plus if she was also ill with covid, you know what your brain feels like when you're sick: it DOES NOT WORK properly!  Thinking and memory are not something that is functional when you are sick with a potentially DEADLY illness, the thinking brain gives way to the survival brain so that people will focus on SELF CARE, because humans need self care when they are sick or they just get more sick.  You never expect someone to remember stuff when they are sick or grieving, but she was sick AND grieving, so NO!  She won't remember OTHER people's priorities when she is sick and grieving. Your birthday is YOUR priority, and seriously, once you hit 21, your birthday ceases to be **super important** to the people in your immediate circle unless there is a boatload of trauma associated with it, then it may still hit their \"important\" radar, but it will definitely start to be much less important as you get older, it's literally just another day for most people.\n\nShe is dealing with A WHOLE LOT OF STUFF and you are worried about your birthday after her dad died and she AND HER MOM got covid?

If you just continue the relationship and hold a grudge that will always be between the two of you and you will always blame her (which will frustrate her as well at some point since she can't make it up no matter what she does).
