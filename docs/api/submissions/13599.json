Talking about our sex life to his friends is annoying, but it's guy talk I don't care. Lying about it on the other hand, made me see red. So I gave Sam the same response I told David every time. \"Our agreement was if he would then I would. So when he finally accepted that stipulation everything was fine. Maybe try that?\" Sam's face when white. Monday night David came home from guys night and blew up. He said Sam told some of the guys what I said and now they keep making comments about it.

When they don\u2019t want their butt to be touched, they shouldn\u2019t pressure anyone else to let them  (you shouldn\u2019t pressure anyone into anything of course)\nand the reaction of his friends is probably the explanation as to why they are like that.", "NTA - good for you lol", "You didn't lie, you stated your agreement.

Will he do stupid things again? Def. And will that be an issue where you can burn him again, or will communication be the better avenue? Up to you.

Not homophobic--just straight guys don't like things being put into us. \n\nand again did I defend him \"playing the victim\"? No. did I say that he should have lied or even talked about that to his friends? no.\n\nI don't disagree he's acting like I child.\n\nI'm trying to state acting back like a child isn't non-AH behavior."]}
