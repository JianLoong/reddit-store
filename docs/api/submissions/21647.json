When I arrived back at the hospital, I was helped to clean / freshen myself up. I decided to have a bit of a rest in bed. When I decided to get up and get into my wheelchair for dinner, the nurse that came to help me into the wheelchair asked if I had wet myself. I told her that I did wet myself earlier in the day, but I had help to freshen up.\n\nShe didn't believe me. She lent down, and smelt my vag. She then put her hand there, coz she wanted to \"feel\" if I was wet. This made me feel very uncomfortable. After getting into the wheelchair, she then felt and smelt the bed. Which made me even more uncomfortable and very nervous.\n\nA few hours later, she helped me to the toilet so I could relieve myself. She kept walking in and out with a garbage bag and wet towels. One of the times, she kissed her reflection in the mirror. When I had finished, she wanted to \"was your bottom with a warm towel that I have just finished washing another patient with\". I completely freaked out.\n\nThe next day, I saw a nurse that I really like and trust. I told her what had happened and that I was feeling rather nervous and freaked out about it. This nurse helped me write out a formal complaint.\n\nI have since found out thru the head nurse that the nurse I put the complaint about has been stood down without pay until she has passed a sensitive training. Plus she has to do a course about personal space and personal boundaries. And she won't be able to work with patients that have an cognitive impairment like dementia.\n\nAm I the Ahole in this?
