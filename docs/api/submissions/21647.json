I was wearing an incontinence aide (a \"adult nappy\"). Because I knew that no one would be able to help me to the toilet if I needed to go.\n\nAnyway. I did have to go, and wet the nappy. When I arrived back at the hospital, I was helped to clean / freshen myself up. I decided to have a bit of a rest in bed. When I decided to get up and get into my wheelchair for dinner, the nurse that came to help me into the wheelchair asked if I had wet myself. I told her that I did wet myself earlier in the day, but I had help to freshen up.\n\nShe didn't believe me. She lent down, and smelt my vag. She then put her hand there, coz she wanted to \"feel\" if I was wet. This made me feel very uncomfortable. After getting into the wheelchair, she then felt and smelt the bed. Which made me even more uncomfortable and very nervous.\n\nA few hours later, she helped me to the toilet so I could relieve myself. She kept walking in and out with a garbage bag and wet towels. One of the times, she kissed her reflection in the mirror. When I had finished, she wanted to \"was your bottom with a warm towel that I have just finished washing another patient with\". I completely freaked out.\n\nThe next day, I saw a nurse that I really like and trust. I told her what had happened and that I was feeling rather nervous and freaked out about it. This nurse helped me write out a formal complaint.\n\nI have since found out thru the head nurse that the nurse I put the complaint about has been stood down without pay until she has passed a sensitive training. Plus she has to do a course about personal space and personal boundaries. And she won't be able to work with patients that have an cognitive impairment like dementia.\n\nAm I the Ahole in this?

You helped other patients who may be less able to speak up for themselves. You don't touch a person without their consent, especially someone in a position of power or caring over another person like a nurse. Plus she using the same towel on multiple patients?! Unhygienic, and could spread infections or disease", "Nurse here! NTA. That nurse was wildly unprofessional. If you are alert and oriented there's absolutely no reason to violate you to determine if you were incontinent. And don't even get me started on telling you that she was going to clean you with a towel she used on another patient...I hope that was some sort of really inappropriate joke (though I don't get the punchline) because that is disgusting, an infection control issue, and in direct contradiction of everything we know of appropriate care in the profession. She NEEDS more training and to be quite honest, shes not someone I would want in our profession.", "NTA. I work at a hospital and we actively encourage patients to submit feedback, especially negative feedback. It\u2019s the only way we can uphold a high standard of care and ensure the health and safety of all our patients. If the other nurse was happy to assist you with your complaint, then she was supporting you and seeing the need for the complaint", "NTA. JFC. This is like a waiter taking a sip of drinks to know which one is the diet", "NTA\nGood grief I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. That \u2018nurse\u2019 sounds like she has some mental health issues to be honest. She treated you in a manner so far beyond inappropriate that it was almost criminal.\nNever second guess yourself when it comes to your privacy, autonomy & dignity. You deserve a formal apology and she deserves to be fired.", "NTA.  I worked for an assisted living facility once, and we would have rioted if that nurse was in our building.  Absolutely **no one** would have accepted that, not patients, not family, not other nurses, not even the laundry aides.  \n\nI am so sorry that happened to you.  Admin is handling it appropriately, but that one is on thin ice...one more side step and she'll be dropped (rightly so)", "You definitely did the right thing OP.\n\nNTA.", "NTA NTA NTA.", "Why would she get paid after the way she treated a patient? She's lucky to not get fired. This wasn't an issue of lack of proper training, so she made a simple mistake. It was a complete and utter violation of another human being. She knew that what she was doing was wrong.", "NTA, that is INSANE behavior. Kissed her reflection? Wanted to reuse a towel on you that another patient used? Put her hand on you without permission and after you said NO already!?!?!? ARGH I'm so mad you went through that!!", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't make a complaint. You told a nurse you trust what happened. She evaluated what happened and made a complaint, because in her opinion it warranted it. You should not really have been made aware of the repercussions except if you had concerns she would look after you again and only then reassured that you wouldn't.\n\nIncontinence is way more common than people realise, but this was less a matter of fact way about it and crossing multiple boundaries. I sometimes have to balance this consideration of feelings with the practicalities of making sure a relative is safeguarded for leaks (they suffer from incontinence and also have a nephostromy, with a leg bag that constantly comes unattached). I check also that I have not embarassed them afterwards.\n\nI mean you must have felt like a liar when she questioned you but no apology for that.\n\nYou did a good thing. The nurse needs the training. If you had asked to raise a complaint, that would have been fine as well. Thanks, for all the other people that should receive better care now.", "Yikes NTA. That nurse was hella unprofessional.", "Ahole?  You're a superhero!  NTA", "This scared the crap out of me in so many ways.

You\u2019re helping yourself and others who may not be able to speak up.", "NTA.  This nurse is lucky she wasn't arrested for touching your vag without your consent.  You told her you weren't wet, she had no reason to go near that area.  You're a hero for reporting her.", "NTA and that\u2019s sexual assault, not just wildly inappropriate", "NTA think how you felt, now think of the times she probably made people feel even worse, now think of how many people go to hospital and how many people she sees daily, now times that by 365 days and possibly 20 or 30 people each day.\n\nYou saved alot of people feeling as you did or worse, if the person learns their lesson great they are able to do their job better if not then they arent right for the job", "Sounds like you did the right thing to me. NTA", "NTA NTA NTA.\nI'm so sorry, from what you've described it sounds like you were assaulted.\nTo explain the severity of this, you would be most justified in making a complaint to the police. This woman should never be trusted near another patient ever again.\nIs there any family or friend you could share this with? I hope you feel supported that you absolutely did the right thing. Guilt is a normal part of being assaulted - please speak to a professional who can help you process this.", "**NTA** \\- she did not respect you, and who knows who else she has done this with. The other nurse knew how important it was to report. It's not something done lightly, and in this case it was needed. You saved others having the same thing done.", "NTA. This nurse crossed a line.", "NTA OP did the right thing. That nurse was horrible, actually she should lose her job", "NTA NTA NTA! Omg! I\u2019m sorry that person violated you. Filing a complaint was the correct thing to do. Thank you for reporting them. That type of behavior is demeaning and uncalled for.", "That seems very standard to report a concern and then have the concern handled.\n\nNTA", "NTA. That nurse's behaviour was unprofessional, improper, and creepy as fuck. I would have reported her too if it had been me.\n\nHospital stays suck enough without having to deal with people like her.", "I thank God my dad didn't have a nurse like that. Most assuredly NTA.", "NTA-- You did not do anything wrong.\n\nI work in a community that the members cannot tell me if another staff harms them.  \n\nImagine a nurse doing this to patient who physically cannot tell anyone what happened to them.\n\nSo if you ever feel any sort of guilt I want you to think of my community and I thank you for what you did to protect those who could not make complaints for themselves.  Because you are not the first person she did all that to.", "NTA at all. That\u2019s a really good outcome - the nurse required that training, and you\u2019ve saved other people from experiencing the same poor treatment that you did. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through this to get to that point though. You should feel proud of yourself for raising concerns. \n\nI\u2019m very sorry about the loss of your mother, I hope you\u2019re doing ok x", "NTA. OMG I can't believe the way that nurse infantilized you. So *rude.*  She 100% deserved it. Don't feel bad for standing up for your rights and dignity.\n\nI hope you are better soon.\n\nSorry for the loss of your mother.", "Absolutely, you did the right thing.  Never put with being abused.

Really sorry you were put through that.", "Zero evidence of anything apart from op word and you all want the lady fired and arrested n shit you lot are absolute fucking morons it\u2019s so depressing how easily manipulated people really are. Imagine I now make a post pretending to be the nurse and talking about how I was just fired after receiving a false complaint and what really happened was the patient kept shitting themselves on purpose knowing I\u2019d have to change them and they were clearly getting turned on by this happening but they\u2019ve made a complaint saying I essentially abused them. Do we all just believe me or what now ?", "Sorry, but I do not believe you. Not one word of this make up", "NTA if the hospital deems, she needed these courses and can\u2019t work with those patients that means that she shouldn\u2019t if it was all in your head, the hospital wouldn\u2019t have taken these measures", "NTA SO MUCH NTA!
