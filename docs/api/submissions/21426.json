Kurt wasn't allowed to go out as a fitting punishment for his repeatedly breaking rules and shitty grades.\n\nIt seemed like this taught him a lesson because he finally started turning in some As.

I bet this isn't the first time you talked down to him. And keeping him out of a celebratory dinner with his siblings? All you're doing is making him hate them more and lashing out. \n\nYou made him this way and now you are complaining. Kids pick up things pretty quickly and he knows you don't care about him so he's acting out for attention.\n\nGet yourself sorted up, apologize, and make it up to him in a big way.", "YTA but I think you knew that already. You are so obviously playing favorites with your kids and as someone who was the least favorite sibling, oh boy does it hurt. I don\u2019t care what you say your logic behind it is. What Kurt hears is \u201cI love your brother and sister more than you because of who you are\u201d and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s spent years wondering why he isn\u2019t worthy of your love like your other 2 kids are. \n\nBe warned about this: he might care now. He might even try to change himself so that he could be worthy in your eyes. But trust me when I say that that wears off. Eventually he\u2019s going to wonder why he should care what you think about him at all. I can guarantee there will be a moment where he decides that YOU are not worth his effort or HIS love. You as the parent either need to fix this and fix it fast or get ready for Kurt to go no contact with you in the future because based on your very short post with minimal detail, you\u2019re not the kind of parent Kurt will want to stay in touch with", "How you could write all that and still not see YTA is truly beyond me.

How old is Kurt? I'm betting old enough to not be effected by punishment. You are just pushing him away. How about guiding him to find what he IS good at and likes? And walking funny? How about seeing if he needs medical care? So many other things I could comment on but overall your are just doing it all wrong.", "YTA. You absolutely voiced your frustrations in a way that cast Mark as a disappointment. And whether or not what you said was true, that's the kind of thing that sticks with a kid.

Instead of motivating your kid, you make him feel less than and then don\u2019t even allow him to attend a celebratory dinner as punishment.

Because he wants the same affection you give them?", "YTA. Way to push a big ol finger into a pretty standard and obvious hurt your son has. Unfortunately feeling less than your older siblings is a tale as old as time. You just made it that much worse for your CHILD. Read that word again, child. He still has room to grow and change man. He\u2019s not stuck as a 15 year old rule breaker forever. I get it\u2019s hard to have a kid that makes dangerous and stupid decisions and won\u2019t apply themselves when given opportunities. But any \u201cgood\u201d your punishments were doing is probably completely undone now. Find a way to support your kid that needs the extra help. None of your kids have the same parents, y\u2019all are also changing as you grow older. Figure out what you are doing wrong with your third child. He is crying for help and you just seem to be punishing him instead of trying to figure out what he needs.", "YTA,\nObviously.  Kurt isn\u2019t like your other kids but instead of trying to find out his interests and supporting him you blame him for it.

I also had an older brother who was everything I could never be. All I ever wanted was to be loved for who I was, not for who my mom wanted me to be. The only time she ever showed love was when she judged that I behaved according to her opinion of what was right. I left home at 16, went no contact at 25. I went on to have an amazing life.

I knew my mom would be furious with me for going out, so I hid my injury, figuring I could walk it off. But, it didn't go away... a few days later, she asked what was wrong. I figured, okay, she noticed, she probably cares. So I told her. Nope, she got furious with me for going out, called me a liar, and said I would never be like my successful older siblings. So I limped back to my room to be alone.\"\n\nEven if your son was lying about the tree thing, it's probably because he can't feel safe telling you the truth and it's not like you cared about him anyway.\n\nYou should be ashamed op.\n\n(Eta, I know I used she/her pronouns, but this goes either way, whether op is the mother or father.)", "YTA on so many levels, nuff said", "YTA I don't think I need to tell u why the fact that u don't know  if u the asshole or not speaks for itself", "Oh Lord.

I believe this child has been compared to his two eldest siblings his whole life without being him being seen for who and what he is and being loved for that.    What sort of parent even thinks something like that?  you know what you said was wrong but that's beside the point.  That is what you truly feel, and that is a problem.  If you treat a child like that btw, they do tend to rebel.  All you talked about was breaking rules (coming home late) and not getting As....for all I know you consider Bs and Cs as bad grades. . . . this is rather heart breaking things could be so much worse.

The damage my mother did to me, way worse. He is 14 for Pete's sake! You are only damaging his self esteem, you will drive a wedge in the relationship he has with his siblings and I can guarantee he will go no contact. People like you should never have children... NEVER! Hell, it should be downright illegal. The amount of therapy that poor child is going to need. The fact that you didn't even take him to a doctor or the ER to make sure his leg isn't broken or damaged is extremely concerning... Very concerning. CPS has been called for lesser things. I'm surprised you aren't getting a visit from them... You see your child injured I don't freaking care how disappointed or angry you are with them you take them to the doctor! My freaking daughter fell off a freaking swing(one of those porch swings) and it was barely a fall, but because she limped and because she said it was hurt we took her to the ER! Didn't even wait, just took her immediately. She sprained her ankle. She had to walk with crutches... The point of the matter on that is if we had neglected her and had not taken her we would have never known she sprained her ankle. You need to do better.

Every parent is going to have a favorite or favorites, especially if the siblings are of the same gender. The important thing is to do your best to minimize that favoritism and not show it, not throw it right in the kid's face by saying, \"You'll never measure up to them\", which is basically what you did.\n\nI have several siblings, and I was probably the least troublesome of the lot, yet also toward the middle or bottom of the pack, as far as favorites go. They tried to treat us all equally, but it was pretty obvious which were the favorites and where I ranked.\n\nI was okay with that, because, while I wasn't the favorite, they at least treated me as my own person, or so I thought. One day, when I was still in HS, dad and I were having a bit of a heated discussion, and he said, \"I don't know why I even bother trying to talk to you. You're just like your brother Reggie. Exact same attitude, exact same chip on your shoulder, and you'll wind up just like him.\" Reggie had been out of the house by the time I was old enough to be aware of anything, so I don't know what he was like at home. But just from stories about him I would get when I was a child, he was a rudderless ship, adrift at sea, and very angry. He was always fighting, job-hopping, and had a very poor relationship with dad. In that instant, I felt less like my own person and more like dad's attempt to get it right with Reggie. It made me wonder if every interaction I'd had with dad up to that point was filtered through how he felt about Reggie.\n\nA few years later, I tried to talk to dad about it, to let him know how that made me feel. Instead of wanting to talk it out, he instead blew up at me and said he would \"never compare any of\" his children and that I had to be misremembering. But, I wasn't. I tried to push it, and the most he would concede was that maybe he'd said it but I misunderstood and that he was saying something else. But the words he said were pretty clear.\n\nHere we are 30 years later and that comment still comes up in my head a lot. Dad and Reggie still have issues, and so any time dad seems friendlier toward me and more communicative, I wonder if it's because he really wants to talk to me, or is it because I'm his surrogate Reggie for those rough patches. \n\nSo yeah, what you said is probably not going to help Kurt in any way but will probably stick with him for a long time.", "Oh wow.

I was almost failing my online classes in college, but in person I was straight As and Bs. Homework was impossible for me in high school. After high school, I found out I had ADHD. I would forget homework at home, or forget it was due. My mother telling me I wasn't trying my best when I really was broke me. They spent my entire life calling me lazy when I really had an attention disorder and couldn't stay focused. It's one of the reasons I cut off contact with them. Congrats, your kid is going to spend years fixing your bs in therapy.", "The smarter a kid is, the easier it is for a genuine learning disability or other disorder to go undetected, because they can often sidestep some things through creative approaches, and are better at hiding or blending.\n\n'Being frustrated at his wasted potential' is a huge red flag, and the source of a lot of pressure for these kids to perform. What they learn instead is that their parents are unsafe, and they resort to avoidance of people and schoolwork, trying to just put their heads down and wait out the hell that sort of pressure puts them in. \n\nRegardless, YTA, and your entire attitude towards your son is a travesty.", "The fact that you even think that what you said is true means you're failing him. To think that about your own child, who I assume are biological, means somewhere along the lines he did not get what he needs to flourish. Either that, or how you define success and how he defines success are two different things. \n\n>If I truly thought that he couldn't do any better, I'd praise him for doing his best anyway. But he isn't.\n\nWhich begs the question of, who is deciding that he is doing his best or not? Clearly the standard that you've set and the expectations that you want for him are not what he wants for himself. He is failing because YOU failed him. You failed at understanding who he is and expecting and then being disappointed in the fact that he's not your older children. This says way more about you than it does him.\n\nDisabilities can also manifest in all different kind of ways. Just because he has an aptitude for algebra, doesn't mean that maybe there is an auditory processing issues, which makes learning in a classroom more difficult than being 1-on-1. Perhaps instead of finding the negative, you should look for how you can do better for him.", "I am diagnosed with ADHD and I tutored for the entirety of my junior high and highschool years. These things are not at all mutually exclusive. The fact that you consider his struggles some sort of personality flaw speaks entirely to you and how you're failing him. \n\nHe needs help, from actual experts. He seems to be stuck in some sort of hole, and because you believe it's his personal failing for not producing a ladder, you're punishing him for being in the hole. Be a parent, get him the help he needs instead of punishing him for needing help.", "INFO: What did the doctor say about his injuries after he fell out of a tree and was unable to walk properly?", "GET THAT CHILD EVALUATED FOR LD and ADHD! \n\nYour comments are screaming red flags that you\u2019re choosing to ignore. \n\nI\u2019d bet your son\u2019s GPA that Kurt has ADHD and/or a LD. \n\nYou\u2019re a failure as a parent, OP.

Adhders often seem like \"gifted kids who don't apply themselves\" as they tend to be smart, but the executive disfunction gets in the way. If a child is bright there's always an underlying reason they aren't preforming well, either psychological, or learning disability or enviornmental. \nAnd you are failing him, coming from someone with an MA  in child development.

You'd just punish him), and you have no ability to discern if he has a learning disability. You're punitive with him because he doesn't excel at the shallow academic curriculum forced on kids and he coyld sense your lack of belief in him before you told it to his face.

He needs to be tested for disabilities, this sounds like textbook ADHD. \n\nIf it is ADHD, and you get him tested, into therapy, and possibly also medication, then you can work to undo the damage you've caused him - and you have done damage.  You are belittling him with your comparisons.\n\nIf you don't get him tested despite all of this, you will destroy him. I grew up with undiagnosed and untreated ADHD and I will literally never recover. I will never feel like my life has value because of things like this. Not even by parents (they didn't do the things you're doing, at least, and no one suggested a disability to test for,) but by teachers and others around me. \n\nYour son will never be \"normal\" like your other kids, but you have the power to decide if he can survive and recover or if he gives up entirely on himself. \n\nStop letting him down.

Both the physical and emotional scars btw.\n\nAs someone who was a little too scared to tell my parents when I needed help after ducking up, it would have been awesome if my parents had paid a little more attention and were the adults I needed more. I love my parents, but they still don\u2019t get why none of us trusted them as teens. My brother drove a car that would cut off in the middle of the road for months because he was too scared of my dad to tell him something was wrong. Don\u2019t be that parent dude", "Why do you think he\u2019d come to you? When he tries to talk to you, you insult him. I wouldn\u2019t trust you as far as I could throw you. I doubt he does either. How sad. He hid an injury from you.", "Woman, scars? Injuries? Walking funny? You are even more neglectful than I thought, somebody might be hurting/bullying your kid wich would explain the marks and the fact that you presume not only to know your son but that he would go to you with his problems is the biggest delusion of all.", "If your child has \u201cweird scars and injuries\u201d TAKE HIM TO A DOCTOR, you epic AH.", "Unless you have x ray eyes you have no idea whether he's badly injured.

Punishments do nothing to address that issue. Telling him he is a \"unique person\" does nothing but compound that issue if he hears \"you are a unique person, so give up,\", which if he didn't hear that before he certainly does now.\n\nI'm serious, what have you actually done to help your own damn son?", "So your child has been injured semi-seriously multiple times and you just don\u2019t take him to the doctor?
