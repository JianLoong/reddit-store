Running a marathon is impressive no matter how long it takes you", "Has she ran a marathon before?\n\nSeven hours is not a particularly good marathon time. But if they aren't experienced in marathons than it isn't that far off what would be expected. Especially if you're running in 90\u00b0 heat. \n\nWhat's impressive also changes per person. A shorter time might be impressive for some people- but for lots of people just being able to do a marathon at all is impressive. It's all dependent.", "INFO:  Does her marathon time beat \\*your\\* marathon time?  \n\nYTA", "No that is not fast, I do walk faster than that, in fact many marathons have less than 7 hour cut offs, but YTA  for not finding a way to point this out without sounding condescending.

You clearly haven\u2019t considered the conditions she was doing it in, 17 miles a minute in the sand and 90 degree heat for a far longer distance than your half marathon is isn\u2019t unimpressive.", "So you felt the need to dismiss someone else\u2019s achievement because it didn\u2019t qualify to your \u201cstandards\u201d?

He was very slow. Much slower than your daughter\u2019s friend. Finished in the last 5%. I would\u2019ve finished much faster with zero training. \n\nBut you know what? I was super proud of him, because it takes a LOT more determination to spend that much time and effort on just finishing, while others finish in a fraction of the time. Not to mention he\u2019d had a heart transplant (with complications) a few years earlier, and had never been athletic before.\n\nOh, and YTA.", "YTA \nBecause so many are judged on time but the friend ran the 26.2 miles? Yes. In 90. Degree heat. You never reached the 26.2??? My mother finished her 5 marathons in less than 5 hours but she did in in Chicago weather. And it\u2019s still a giant accomplishment. To get to the 26.2 takes so much time and effort. I remember my father following her in a car until she got out of a dark forest area and back in viability and to do that takes so much endurance. The girl could have walked it and would be more accomplished than you.", "YTA.  I haven\u2019t run one, and neither have you.

Why don't you go run a marathon in a hot place and let us know what your time is?", "YTA\u2026 she did a marathon\u2026 something you haven\u2019t done and yet you are commenting negatively about a person who has finished something that you haven\u2019t done or tried.", "YTA. And you\u2019re using your daughter\u2019s friend as an outlet for some weird confidence issues.", "yta. if you feel it\u2019s so unimpressive, why dont you go ahead and run a marathon in the same desert conditions and compare? not to mention that its impressive for anyone to even complete a marathon.", "So you've never run a marathon before, but are shading someone who has? She RAN for SEVEN HOURS. It doesn't even matter if it was good time. You haven't even attempted running for seven hours. Who are you to comment on her? Edited to vote YTA", "YTA. You\u2019ve never ran a marathon before so you can\u2019t degrade something you have no experience in. Additionally, it\u2019s really not hard to just be nice regardless if you did have experience. Also, it was in the DESERT. Ya know, the big hot landscape that would definitely cause an impact on any person.", "YTA. A marathon is no joke at any speed. A hobbyist such as yourself should know trotting that half one should know you don\u2019t shit on other runners.", "YTA. By your own admission, you've never run a full marathon.

Her friend was proud of the achievement which means it was a big deal for her so whether it was 7 hours or 4 the answer is congratulations.\n\nI do 5k in about 44 mins pre baby.

Did the girl/woman finish?  That\u2019s an accomplishment in itself, then adding in the heat.  Even if she didn\u2019t finish just trying is an accomplishment.

Your daughters best friend accomplished a feat that not many are able to do or will attempt to do.  No matter what her time was and whether she walked, ran, or crawled she finished it.

I am a runner myself and by no means fast but I am good with finishing and then as I move to the next run beating that time.  I haven't done a full marathon yet but it is on my list.
