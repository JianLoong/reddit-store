And, maybe he\u2019s the one that should be getting out more and leaving the house since he TOO works from home.\n\nEither buy a bigger home with offices far far away from each other or compromise (maybe you switch off going into the office every other Friday or something)", "So, he's always at home, is he?\n\nSeriously, what fuckery is this?  He's so \\*rude\\*!  I sympathise with the desire to spend time alone\u2014which presumably you also have\u2014but there are plenty of polite and pleasant ways to arrange this, ways that do not suggest to other people that the man doesn't even \\*like\\* his spouse.\n\nI mean.  Possibly you would like to leave the house sometimes to go out for some kind of leisure activity, an evening class or a visit to the theatre or whatever, leaving this charming husband in charge of your child.  Possibly you could come to a reciprocal arrangement.  But to speak to you like that.... no.  Just, no.\n\nNTA, with bells on.", "INFO: Why doesn't he want you home? Is he planning on inviting ppl over or is space really cramped?\n\n It kinda seems like a non-issue but if you are home all the time maybe give him a weekend off and have you and your kid visit someone/somewhere.", "NTA\n\nRight now I work 100% from home, and my partner works at home 2-3 days every week.  The days he is at the office, I actually miss him.\n\nFor sure, some times you everybody needs alone time, but you have to create your alone time.\n\nTo me, there seems to be an issue in your relationship has a whole, either a communication one (your husband is not expressing his real need) or compatibility issue.  Have you brought up counseling?", "NTA. You both work from home and have plenty of space. \n\nWhy exactly is 'you being there' the problem? \nWhat on earth does he need the whole space entirely to himself for that you being home would be a problem?  \nWhy can't he just go back to his outside office if being alone is so important?  The audacity! \n\nI work evenings so I'm out of the house in the late afternoon and my husband works from home most of the time so we see each other during the day, but he also has an office with a closed door if he needs privacy. I honestly don't know how I'd react if he ever complained about me existing in our shared space. \n\nUnless you're getting in the way of his watching porn or something worse, I just don't understand his justification that of the two of you, you're the one crowding the space.", "NTA. It is understandable that you would want to work from home when you are responsible for a child and would otherwise have to spend at least one hour a day minimum on the road (plus the time it takes to make yourself presentable for work - women are expected to look a certain way but men can just put on a pair of slacks and a shirt and go out the door.)\n\nThis is your home, too. If your husband doesn't want to share it, maybe he should be the one who works in his office outside the home. \n\nYour husband is the asshole here.", "NTA.  I was going to go NAH (I'll explain) except that he was rude as hell comparing you to an inanimate object.\n\nOK, so this is coming from someone who has been with their SO for 28 years and married 24 years.  We met in undergrad, went to grad school together (in different groups but commuted together) and have worked at the same company (in different groups, but we see each other multiple times per day) for the last 7 years.  Up until the pandemic, he was a regular M:TG judge and was out of town a fair number of days per year.  Since the pandemic, we are together all but the time we're working apart and some time around our slightly different working hours.    \n\n\nAll that to say - sometimes, you do want/need alone time in your own house, but there's a way to approach that discussion without being TA.  Don't WFH from the same place in your house/don't communicate during the day.  If you can work in-person a few days a month (have him drop the baby at daycare on those days to make it easier for you), you should consider it.  If you have single vacation days to spare, don't take them on the same day.", "NTA\n\nAnd holy shit, you\u2019re letting him talk to you like that? Is he also working from home?\n\nI get that sometimes people need time alone but you\u2019re *working* and he didn\u2019t need to insult you to convey that.", "You're leaving out so much information. Does your husband work? Does he work remotely? Does he contribute at all to helping with the kid? Do you ever actually leave your home? \n\nIt's healthy to leave your home at some point during the week even if it's to run errands. \n\nLong story short: wtf does your husband do?", "NTA. Annoying having his wife around? Having a partner say it\u2019s a nuisance having you stay in your OWN home especially since it\u2019s more convenient for taking care of your child is insane. Something is definitely very suspicious here, and your husband needs to take a look at why he\u2019s so bothered about having you at home.", "NTA.  He is as much a parent as you are and needs to pull his weight an this comments to you during maternity leave are such that I'd never have another child with him.\n\nMy husband was fantastic with our kids - a wonderful partner through all of it. I would have stopped having kids with him if he complained at me like this", "NTA. If he wants to be alone he can go talk a walk. It\u2019s your house, be there whenever you want.", "NTA.\n\nMy friend bought a she-shed office in her backyard to get away from her husband who is also home all day everyday.  You can suggest he get a man shed that he can go to in the back yard when he wants to get away.\n\nPeople need space.  I get it.", "NTA - that was not an appropriate way for him to try and convey that he wanted some alone time", "NAH. Neither one of you are in the wrong here but let me say as someone whos spouse is home pretty much 24/7 there comes a time when we all need a little alone time at home. It's not to throw parties or walk around naked it's just to be.Think about all of those reasons you listed about the perks of working from home and then realize that your husband gets perks from occasionally being home alone. \n\nI'm not saying go crazy but plan 1 or 2 days a month that you can work from the office while he works from home or 1 or 2 days a month where you visiting with friends and family so he can have that time. I would kill for this just so I can go crazy cleaning. It won't kill you to be a little flexible. I could 100% work from home but I drive an hour 1 way to an office just so I can have alone time.", "NTA.  Why is he home all the time?", "NTA. \n\nWanting to have the house to oneself on a day off is one thing. Wanting your wife out of the house on a weekday during office hours is another. And also it's weird. If you're in your corner working and he is in his corner working, what does it change whether or not you're here? It's not like he wanted you out of the house so he can nap naked in the living room or invite the boys over or have a lengthy wank session or something. He's going to do the same exact thing (working) that he'd be doing if you were there. \n\nIf he wants the house to himself, why doesn't he ask that you take a weeknight or a week-end day outside of the house from time to time, instead of sending you to do up to 2 hours of commute to work in an empty office?\n\nI am in a long term relationship, we live together, and we both work 100% WFH. Although we have separate offices, I do understand that my boyfriend might want time for himself alone. So I'm not saying this out of not understanding you guys' situation. I still find your husband's request weird and pointless. \n\nYou guys could have an arrangement where once a month, one of you leaves home with the baby so the other can have downtime/me time in house (one day a month for OP, one day a month for hubby). Or they could choose to leave the other home for the day with the baby while they are doing something outside. It would be fair. and normal.", "NTA. Maybe it is really hubby who is surplus to requirements in your house?", "NTA he can go and sit in his car if he wants to be alone and have tantrums.", " You get the house to yourself when he is at the office; you should extend him that same courtesy. Everyone needs to have time away from all of humanity - even the humans that they love and value the most. And he's only asking for ONE DAY in a month!\n\nThe caviat though, is that the days he stays home, he needs to do the \"at home\" stuff that  you do - like taking the baby to/from daycare.\n\nI have to go with ESH because he could be nicer about it than he is.", "Thing is, I get wanting time and space to be alone. But, the minute I got married and shared a house with my husband - I had to accept that those opportunities for Me Time and Me Space were just going to be much more limited. Its the hardest tradeoff lots of us have to make when we start any partnership - no more alone on demand time. So, NTA. This is the life you share now. He's at home and he isn't getting the kid ready, so you can just go to your job?\n\nHe's not acting like a partner, is he?", "NTA\n\nIf you want to stay married, suggest your husband be the one to go out to work.  There are offices he can rent if his company doesn't have one in your town.  He could rent a room and set up in a boarding house for that matter.\n\nIf you don't want to stay married, husband can leave entirely and never worry about having you around again.", "NTA but I think just for peace of mind get a plan in place. Maybe put up a few nanny cams tell him your going to the office for 3 days then see what he is really up to anybody telling you that you need to be out of your own home something is seriously wrong if this were me i would definitely want to know gotta find out what he is up to while your not home", "NTA\n\nEven during maternity leave and postpartum he wanted you out of the house? Send him back to his parents. Your husband is a huge AH! What does he want to do at home that cannot be done with you in the house?\u2026 does he have an addiction or do you suspect of someone on the side?", "Does he work evenings or work from home also?", "NTA", "NTA.  I hate commuting, its a waste of time, of gas ( or electric) and now that its cold season i also don't want to be picking up bugs from my coworkers. When given the choice, i don't go into the office. But is there any type of compromise so that he can have a little bit of the house to himself? Can you leave the house, say twice a month to do errands for a few hours or take a walk/ hike, and stay local. Or, can you guys just have separate areas of the house ( not sure if its big enough) for work or chill purposes?", "NAH - This is a pretty common issue actually, I have this too with my roommate. He could have been nicer but also not going to ignore the whole viewpoint bias we get here from you. \n\nSimply put, doesn't matter how much I love or adore somebody, I need some time away from EVERYBODY occasionally. I get that now with my roommate by just planning on doing nothing when he's gone fishing for the weekend, simple as that, he does it often enough my needs are fulfilled for alone time. You gotta give that to somebody who needs it. \"This is a HIM problem\" is not the way to go about this, you're married, his problems are your problems. Gotta figure this one out, if going into the office occasionally is the way to do it, mazel tov you have the tools.", "? why is he home all the time to be worried about this?\n\nNTA - because there are much better ways to ask someone to have time alone at home.  Does he wfh too? Is he helping with the baby?", "ESH. It doesn\u2019t sound like he ever gets the house to himself, which is a legitimate thing to want. He wasn\u2019t kind in how he shared his feelings though.", "Maybe he wants the same freedom you get? You get to work from home all day every day by yourself. When he does.. you\u2019re there. I\u2019m not saying he was right in comparing you to a fixture but I get where he\u2019s coming from too in that he doesn\u2019t have the same space when working from home. Another way to think about it is - he works in office with people he works from home with \u201cpeople\u201d. You don\u2019t. At all. You can do whatever you want while working. \n\nA compromise might be you work half days in the office once or twice a month when he\u2019s working from home so he can get that \u201cfreedom\u201d when working from home. \n\nNTA but it\u2019s worth talking to him about why he wants to work from home without you around sometimes. It may just boil down to he wants to work in peace? I know it did for me when my ex would have work cancelled and he was home. It felt like an intrusion even though it wasn\u2019t.", "Hmmm - this one is tricky. Is he an introvert? Are you? I only ask because I am and while I do love my husband, I love an occasional empty house. He WFH 100% of the time and I go into my office 2x a week, WFH the rest of the time. I'm saying NTA because you are literally just existing in your space! I get it. Your husband could have delivered this information in a much better, softer way with perhaps a bit of context. Like he doesn't have to give you a list of what he wants to do while you're out but even if its for a reason like mine (needing the occasional unimpeded quiet and not being beholden to anyone's requests/worries/talking for just a few hours) he needs to say it.   \n\n\nI don't think you need to go into the office if you don't want to. But maybe run some errands that would take a few hours, get some coffee, grab a massage, and he can have some alone-in-the-house time and you also get yourself a little time for yourself? At any rate, NTA", "ESH  he has a valid point, but also really went about it the wrong way.    Everyone needs alone time to recharge.   My wife and I ran into this during lockdown when we both wfh in a 700ft apt.   I was always there she was always there no matter the time or day.  It was a near 100% time spent together.  \n\nI\u2019d say maybe take 1 day a week at the office, make a day of it, go to the office, go out for lunch if you have the means, do some errands on the way home, take your time.   It\u2019ll give your husband the time to mentally recharge at home.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, I do think your husband has a valid concern even if he brought it up in not the nicest way. The desire for some alone time in your shared household.\n\nCould this also be a benefit for you? Being home all the time with him, your son, and the dog doesn\u2019t allow you any alone time either. Maybe once a week/month you two could agree that one of you will work from somewhere other than the house? Something like Mondays I go to the office and Fridays hubby will go work at a cafe or something?", "ESH. He could've worded it better but you are coming across as dismissive here. How is only 1 day at the office a month that bad when you already are always at home so he never has the place to himself like you do? You have to compromise in a marriage, you know", "YTA\n\nHe's asking for one day a month. Give it to him. If you don't want to give him a weekday and commute, then you're going to have to sacrifice a weekend day and be gone 8 ish hours.\n\nIt's clear he wants and needs this, and has started to resent you not listening and blowing him off. Resentment is the marriage killer. So, pick the second Tuesday of the month or something, and make that Office Day.\n\nDig in and refuse? He'll just start leaving and not coming back, while the resentment grows over being dismissed.", "NAH.\n\nLook, maybe it's because I'm a huge introvert, but I get where your husband is coming from.  I only get to WFH 1 day a week anymore, but if my spouse is home on the day I'm WFH, it throws me off.  The house isn't as quiet (even though we each have our own separate work spaces, noise leaks); I can't just pop into the bathroom and leave the door open; I can't blast music; etc.  It just makes it harder to fully relax.  I get it.  I would go absolutely nuts without *some* amount of alone time.\n\nI *also* get not wanting to go into the office just because if you don't have to.  I'd 100% rather be WFH full time than spend any time in the office at all. \n\nI don't feel like 1 day a month is a huge ask, but maybe what about a comprise where you leave the house with kiddo for the better part of the day on a Saturday or Sunday once a month?  It would give your husband a break and let him have his alone time in the house, but wouldn't disrupt the weekly routine with your kid?", "NTA, I suppose you could say the same to him. Why is he so entitled that he gets the house to himself. It is not going to be good retirement years (when the time comes) with that attitude.", "NTA.\n\nIf he wants some alone time, *he* can go out. My wife is currently a SAHM, and I WFH (our company doesn't even have an office), but my wife is happy\\* to have me around almost all the time. With 2 kids under 6, she starts to get agitated only when she knows I'm going to be gone for several days on a business trip.\n\n\\*That's not to say she never fusses at me for <stuff>, but she never suggests that she wants alone time in the house. The closest she comes is if she's really sick and she wants me to sequester the kids to the main floor or basement so she can sleep in peace, which of course if imminently reasonable. She will also occasionally have a half-day out with a friend doing grownup things.", "NTA\nIf you are given the opportunity to wfh full time, which is a blessing, you should be able to do it as much as is available and you want. He should not dictate when you need to be out of the house.\nThat being said, for you own sanity, I do suggest finding some extracurriculars or something to get out and do every so often. Working and living in the same place without a lot of outside interactions can be a recipe for negative mental health. Also, you and he should both get your own alone time, not counting work, just to keep everyone happy and getting along.", "\u2026does your husband even like you?", "Nta\n\nSo he expects you to leave the house WITH your child so he can be alone? \n\nThat man is an embarrassment.", "YTA\n\nOf course he didn\u2019t ask it nicely, but I think it isn\u2019t too much of an effort to work a day in the office once a month to give your husband some space and alone-time if that\u2019s what he really needs. Why would your comfort be more important than his needs?", "YTA he is asking for one day a month and you can't even do that. He wants the house to himself every once in a while. Is this really such a burden that you can't take on to make him happy one day a month.", "NTA\n\nI get maybe wanting alone time and asking you to leave him alone in your bedroom for a while or something like that but the whole house? Calling you, his wife, annoying? Also, I don't want to be that redditor but something isn't adding up with this scenario.", "NTA.  I\u2019m curious as to if he is willing to take the responsibility of caring for your child if he is at home and forces you to go to the office.", "NTA but I wanna know who or what he is doing when you're not around since your presence is such an issue", "You get the house to yourself during the work day 30-40% of the time by my math. Why not give him one day a month to have the same? It sounds like it it's important to him one workday a month isn't a a big ask for something that matters to your partner.", ">I am home a lot, have no extracurriculars (unless you count taking my son to his activities) and no friends close by\n\nYTA\n\nEveryone wants alone time and it can be really difficult when someone is always home with you, even if they are your partner.\n\nOnce a month is super reasonable. It doesn't have to be work, just do something. Go make a friend, start an extra curricular, just something that gets you out of the house for a little bit.\n\nAnd get more than 1 option for socialization. It is bad for your relationship when the only adult you regularly talk to is your husband. That is just a lot of pressure.\n\nSimilarly your husband should be making sure to get out sometimes to give you alone time, and should also be making sure to take an equal part in childcare and housekeeping.", "My partner went back to the office as as covidly possible. He hated working from home, and he hated working in such close proximity to others (me (also WFH) and the kids (SFH)).\n\nNAH. Just try to have a constructive conversation about what you both need and expect.", "I used to know this family. Husband worked from home. Wife was SAHM. Both kids were home schooled. They all had the same hobby, which was taking martial arts at the same dojo. They were always, always all together. Seemed to work for them, they seemed happy!", "NTA but your husband sure is. It's your right to be at home 100% of the time if you want to. If he wants alone time he can leave.

Works good for a get away from the spouse for a bit shed.", "I bet his Man Shed is the bathroom where he goes to hide and avoid participating in his life at home?", "Haha we actually have a shed that long-term we're hoping to convert into a hang-out (although likely for our kiddo when he's older).", "He would be if I left early in the morning, but I simply would rather wfh because it's easier than rushing out the door in the morning, having an avoidable commute in traffic etc. But yeah, he's a big fan of his 'me time'...", "Neither, mostly ball scratching and sports watching - without my judgment that it's the middle of the workday lol. He's got a chill job that allows him some downtime.", "He works from home 60-70% of the time.", "Agreed, it's trash. Yep, we're in a 2000 sq ft house, and work on separate floors.", "Thanks for the perspective, and true. A 'him problem' is a 'me problem' or an 'us problem'. <3", "We used to switch off managing the kids in the morning - a week at a time. No way one person should be scurrying around managing everything while the other whines and doesn't help.", "How does she suck? Just because she doesn't want to waste time commuting just like her husband doesn't want to waste time commuting? She's taking advantage of working from home just like he's been doing.", "I hate that I don't live alone anymore. I love my husband and my family. But, it was a lot to give up - the absolute Me Time anytime I wanted, which was what I was used to and never actually regretted.\n\nBut, I did know it was going to change when I got married and so I would have to get with the program and be gracious about it for the rest of my life. I did decide to marry and have a family, after all. So, I had to change. Period.\n\nIf I really need the Me Time, I take a drive or go somewhere else to decompress now. Been doing it for years. But, no way I'm abrogating responsibility, dumping family tasks on my husband and then whining about how he's always around me in our house and never gives me any space to breathe without him. He lives there. So, he's gonna' be around - a lot. If he needs to get away from the hive - he can't expect the rest of us to get out?", "He can always leave for a walk.", "*You get to work from home all day every day by yourself. When he does.. you\u2019re there. I*\n\nShe said he works from home 60-70% of the time so when she works from home he's also there?", "Yep we're both big introverts and homebodies. <3", "This is what I'm thinking, too.\n\nI don't think OP's husband did a good job of communicating his wants, especially comparing OP to furniture, but I absolutely 100% get where he's coming from.\n\nMy boyfriend pretty much never leaves the house, minus a short trip or two to Home Depot during working hours. I usually go into an office one day every few weeks, and I have hobbies/activities that take me out of the home. For example, I was out last Wednesday night and all morning on Sunday. He has time every week to himself, and when I ask for even just a few hours every so often, he acts like it's a huge burden for him. Asking OP to go into the office one day a month seems pretty minimal.", "Agreed -- I'm an introvert who works in-person in a client facing role, and am married to an introverted homebody who WFH so he never leaves the house of his own volition.\n\nWe've had to have serious talks about how it's a really unfair expectation on his part that I should never have alone time at the house, and that the idea that he goes and gets a cup of coffee or goes for a hike or does something on his own for a morning or afternoon now or then isn't unreasonable.", "Thank you and agreed <3 I definitely need an extra-curricular, I don't argue that. I recently came back from four days away (a solo trip across the country) and he's leaving for LA in a few weeks for a weekend getaway.", "No no - kiddo is in daycare ft. I work full-time from home.", "As someone that *needs* more than average amount of me time (it seems to run in my family), one day is a really, really small ask.", "Yep, he knows he'd be responsible for getting my son ready in the am, out the door, picking up etc. He'd gladly do that to be rid of me for the day lol.", "FYI weekends we tend to split our time, often each taking our son for a few hours to give the other one a break :) And agreed re: being alone.", "Lol he actually sleeps in the guest room (heavy snorer) so gets alone time in the evenings/evenings to himself.", "He can leave if he wants to. You have every right to be in You own home. NTA", "Does he take part in child care?", "That is a HUGE house. I feel like in another room it would feel like you weren't there. NTA. I get needing space, but... with a house like that its plenty of space unless you spend all your time in the same room as each othet. But I think there's something more to the story.\n\nMaybe one day go in for work, but don't exactly tell him beforehand. And the next day if he complains about not having alone time you can mention that you gave him alone time the day before. If he further complains that you didn't tell him before then it's really not about alone time/needing time alone, and he's acting suspicious.", "That is so much space! I'm on sick leave and have been for about a year, so I'm quite used to having the (small one-bedroom) apartment to myself. It's nice because I do have so little energy, and I can do things very much at my own pace and own timing. \n\nMy partner is now also on a sick leave for a few weeks, and it is a huge change for me. I was very used to the routine, and having the apartment to myself. However, I would never kick my partner out of the house! Sometimes I go for little walks by myself when I need space, and that is enough to help.\n\nYour place is so huge, you can easily have your own places, it's also not a sudden adjustment, and you have very valid reasons for being home! Your husband is being ridiculous.", "Further INFO: is he actually only asking for one day a month? If so, YTA if you won\u2019t give him that honestly. Everyone needs alone time, and it sounds like you don\u2019t want to give him that just because he asked. I get he was rude, and he\u2019s and AH for that too, but if you guys are starting off parenthood like this\u2026. I don\u2019t have much hope for you two being together once your kid makes it to high school. \n\nLearn to communicate and compromise more. It\u2019s stressful right now.", "He better download some music or Pokemon go and start taking walks, lord have mercy.", "Would you be willing to go into your office once per month, if he got the kid ready and did the day care drop off/pickup?\n\nJust wondering because it doesn\u2019t seem all that unreasonable of a request in general. However, he clearly went about it all wrong.", "Isn't that what marriage is? If he wants to be alone that much he can go rent himself a motel room for the weekend. NTA. Your husband is tho.", "He is treating you like you are an inconvenience. I also understand that he may want to have time for himself in the house, but his words are in no way respectful. He could've chosen a better way to bring this up without being an AH. I don't know OP, you should set some boundaries regarding the way he talks to you.", "30-40% of the time when he goes into work", "NTA\n\nI think you should tell your husband that you can't be exiled from your household and that you prefer remote work. Perhaps you both need a separate office to work in if you don't have that already. His idea is inherently fine but it's not fine if this isn't something you want to do", "I am too. I can't dog him for that part. I just think that we all have to accept that its crowded and chaotic inside our Barbie Dream House sometimes. \ud83d\ude02", "He\u2019s asking for ONE DAY A MONTH. Being married means you occasionally make a sacrifice, to help your spouse out. It can be as trivial as allowing them honest to god alone time, or something bigger like putting up with MiL more than you like. I promise it won\u2019t kill you to commute 12 days per YEAR. \n\nYTA.", "So basically he is a lazy bum who doesn\u2019t work during working hours\u2026 you got yourself a winner\u2026 he could be helping with chores also\ud83e\udee0", "He wants her to work not from home ONE time per month. He is already doing more days away than that.", "Okay, but he asked for ONE single day per month. He didn\u2019t suggest she should not be around a lot.", "Yes I saw that. But he also goes into the office where there is again people. So he never gets work alone. While she does 40-30% of the time. \n\nSo when he\u2019s not in the office, she is alone\n\nHe\u2019s asking for the same thing even if it\u2019s just 1 day.", "I had to relearn my life when husband started to WFH.\n\nHe was here (home) all the darn time.  I was used to be alone during the day.\n\nIT WAS MY issue, not husband's. I had to learn new coping skills etc.\n\nYou have every right to WFH.  It is your husband who has to learn how to live with this new situation.\n\nNTA", "Got it. I would talk to him and try to come up with a solution that works for the two of you and also let him know that the way he said it before was not the coolest delivery he could have went with!", "Having those solo trips is a good idea I haven't thought about! Typically, if we can't both be out of the house when one of use needs alone time, we just separate in the house for a while and do our own things. I personally just think we get along better when we have time by ourselves to do what we want, not having to consider someone else.", "Does he take care of kiddo that day so you leave? Getting ready, pick up, drop off, dinner or whatever you usually do when wfh? Maybe that's a compromise worth the effort", "His delivery was really rude, but I don't think he's being that unreasonable asking for you to go to the office ONE day a month.\n\nPeople need space and I can see how having someone at home 24/7 and not being able to be alone at home for a day could be grating", "Our child is in daycare ft, and outside of that we both parent him.", "2000 sq ft isn\u2019t huge, it\u2019s the average home size in the US lol.", "Yes, he's asking for one day a month that I leave the house and work downtown.", ">If he wants to be alone that much\n\n He is out 1-2 days *a week*. He is asking for one workday *a month*.", "He does. On average he probably does more cleaning than I do.", "Thing is, I find it acceptable to ask for. But, that doesn't mean its the last word, especially when his wife is the one managing the kid and driving about an hour to go in to work. It has to be a negotiation because she's the one he wants to change. He's not changing his behavior to be accommodating to her needs.\n\nIf he got the kid ready in the mornings so she had less stress, then it would be a no brainer to me. \n\nSome transactions support the relationship - not undermine it. You give. I give. Things work.", "Yep, I told him that this is a \"him problem\" and not a me problem which he agreed with. But still... :S", "Solo trips and staycations are the best, and we both support the other person doing them.", "It isn\u2019t a 800 sq foot house either.", "2000sq ft for 2 adults is plenty big enough.", "One day a month is not a big sacrifice", "Yeah, sorry, you\u2019re an AH if you can\u2019t give him 12 days a year. There is no reason you would refuse other than you\u2019re trying to prove to him you will do whatever you want which will be a death sentence for your marriage. Respectfully, but you\u2019re a mom now, please grow up and learn that he is communicating his needs for a healthy and happy marriage/relationship and being petty and refusing to compromise or give anything is not mature.", "Even if thats the case telling you to leave when he is also there most of the time is AH behavior. He can lock himself somewhere in the house if he wants alone time", "They both need to be accomodating of each other's needs. That's what a partnership is about", "Yeah one day a month doesn\u2019t seem like a big ask but that day he should be getting kiddo ready and to daycare \u2026 and other days tbh sounds like op is always the one", "Actually this is a 'both of you' problem or you wouldn't have brought it here :)", "Going to have to give this a try, maybe a solo fishing weekend or something. Thanks for the idea!", "Yes, 800 < 2000, what\u2019s your point? It still isn\u2019t a HUGE house. It\u2019s basically just a house. Especially when you factor in they have a kid a dog and both work from home. That\u2019s probably pretty cramped, frankly.", "DO ITTTT. It's so rejuvenating, and a privilege if you can swing it."]}
