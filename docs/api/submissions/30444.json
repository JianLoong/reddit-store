And, maybe he\u2019s the one that should be getting out more and leaving the house since he TOO works from home.\n\nEither buy a bigger home with offices far far away from each other or compromise (maybe you switch off going into the office every other Friday or something)", "So, he's always at home, is he?\n\nSeriously, what fuckery is this?  He's so \\*rude\\*!  I sympathise with the desire to spend time alone\u2014which presumably you also have\u2014but there are plenty of polite and pleasant ways to arrange this, ways that do not suggest to other people that the man doesn't even \\*like\\* his spouse.\n\nI mean.  Possibly you would like to leave the house sometimes to go out for some kind of leisure activity, an evening class or a visit to the theatre or whatever, leaving this charming husband in charge of your child.  Possibly you could come to a reciprocal arrangement.  But to speak to you like that.... no.  Just, no.\n\nNTA, with bells on.", "INFO: Why doesn't he want you home? Is he planning on inviting ppl over or is space really cramped?\n\n It kinda seems like a non-issue but if you are home all the time maybe give him a weekend off and have you and your kid visit someone/somewhere.", "NTA\n\nRight now I work 100% from home, and my partner works at home 2-3 days every week.  The days he is at the office, I actually miss him.\n\nFor sure, some times you everybody needs alone time, but you have to create your alone time.\n\nTo me, there seems to be an issue in your relationship has a whole, either a communication one (your husband is not expressing his real need) or compatibility issue.  Have you brought up counseling?", "NTA. You both work from home and have plenty of space. \n\nWhy exactly is 'you being there' the problem? \nWhat on earth does he need the whole space entirely to himself for that you being home would be a problem?  \nWhy can't he just go back to his outside office if being alone is so important?  The audacity! \n\nI work evenings so I'm out of the house in the late afternoon and my husband works from home most of the time so we see each other during the day, but he also has an office with a closed door if he needs privacy. I honestly don't know how I'd react if he ever complained about me existing in our shared space. \n\nUnless you're getting in the way of his watching porn or something worse, I just don't understand his justification that of the two of you, you're the one crowding the space.", "NTA. It is understandable that you would want to work from home when you are responsible for a child and would otherwise have to spend at least one hour a day minimum on the road (plus the time it takes to make yourself presentable for work - women are expected to look a certain way but men can just put on a pair of slacks and a shirt and go out the door.)\n\nThis is your home, too. If your husband doesn't want to share it, maybe he should be the one who works in his office outside the home. \n\nYour husband is the asshole here.", "NTA.  I was going to go NAH (I'll explain) except that he was rude as hell comparing you to an inanimate object.\n\nOK, so this is coming from someone who has been with their SO for 28 years and married 24 years.  We met in undergrad, went to grad school together (in different groups but commuted together) and have worked at the same company (in different groups, but we see each other multiple times per day) for the last 7 years.  Up until the pandemic, he was a regular M:TG judge and was out of town a fair number of days per year.  Since the pandemic, we are together all but the time we're working apart and some time around our slightly different working hours.    \n\n\nAll that to say - sometimes, you do want/need alone time in your own house, but there's a way to approach that discussion without being TA.  Don't WFH from the same place in your house/don't communicate during the day.  If you can work in-person a few days a month (have him drop the baby at daycare on those days to make it easier for you), you should consider it.  If you have single vacation days to spare, don't take them on the same day.", "NTA\n\nAnd holy shit, you\u2019re letting him talk to you like that? Is he also working from home?\n\nI get that sometimes people need time alone but you\u2019re *working* and he didn\u2019t need to insult you to convey that.", "You're leaving out so much information. Does your husband work? Does he work remotely? Does he contribute at all to helping with the kid? Do you ever actually leave your home? \n\nIt's healthy to leave your home at some point during the week even if it's to run errands. \n\nLong story short: wtf does your husband do?", "[deleted]", "NTA.  He is as much a parent as you are and needs to pull his weight an this comments to you during maternity leave are such that I'd never have another child with him.\n\nMy husband was fantastic with our kids - a wonderful partner through all of it. I would have stopped having kids with him if he complained at me like this", "NTA. If he wants to be alone he can go talk a walk. It\u2019s your house, be there whenever you want.", "NTA.\n\nMy friend bought a she-shed office in her backyard to get away from her husband who is also home all day everyday.  You can suggest he get a man shed that he can go to in the back yard when he wants to get away.\n\nPeople need space.  I get it.", "NTA - that was not an appropriate way for him to try and convey that he wanted some alone time", "NAH. Neither one of you are in the wrong here but let me say as someone whos spouse is home pretty much 24/7 there comes a time when we all need a little alone time at home. It's not to throw parties or walk around naked it's just to be.Think about all of those reasons you listed about the perks of working from home and then realize that your husband gets perks from occasionally being home alone. \n\nI'm not saying go crazy but plan 1 or 2 days a month that you can work from the office while he works from home or 1 or 2 days a month where you visiting with friends and family so he can have that time. I would kill for this just so I can go crazy cleaning. It won't kill you to be a little flexible. I could 100% work from home but I drive an hour 1 way to an office just so I can have alone time.", "NTA.  Why is he home all the time?", "NTA. \n\nWanting to have the house to oneself on a day off is one thing. Wanting your wife out of the house on a weekday during office hours is another. And also it's weird. If you're in your corner working and he is in his corner working, what does it change whether or not you're here? It's not like he wanted you out of the house so he can nap naked in the living room or invite the boys over or have a lengthy wank session or something. He's going to do the same exact thing (working) that he'd be doing if you were there. \n\nIf he wants the house to himself, why doesn't he ask that you take a weeknight or a week-end day outside of the house from time to time, instead of sending you to do up to 2 hours of commute to work in an empty office?\n\nI am in a long term relationship, we live together, and we both work 100% WFH. Although we have separate offices, I do understand that my boyfriend might want time for himself alone. So I'm not saying this out of not understanding you guys' situation. I still find your husband's request weird and pointless. \n\nYou guys could have an arrangement where once a month, one of you leaves home with the baby so the other can have downtime/me time in house (one day a month for OP, one day a month for hubby). Or they could choose to leave the other home for the day with the baby while they are doing something outside. It would be fair. and normal.", "NTA. Maybe it is really hubby who is surplus to requirements in your house?", "NTA he can go and sit in his car if he wants to be alone and have tantrums.", " You get the house to yourself when he is at the office; you should extend him that same courtesy. Everyone needs to have time away from all of humanity - even the humans that they love and value the most. And he's only asking for ONE DAY in a month!\n\nThe caviat though, is that the days he stays home, he needs to do the \"at home\" stuff that  you do - like taking the baby to/from daycare.\n\nI have to go with ESH because he could be nicer about it than he is.", "Thing is, I get wanting time and space to be alone. But, the minute I got married and shared a house with my husband - I had to accept that those opportunities for Me Time and Me Space were just going to be much more limited. Its the hardest tradeoff lots of us have to make when we start any partnership - no more alone on demand time. So, NTA. This is the life you share now. He's at home and he isn't getting the kid ready, so you can just go to your job?\n\nHe's not acting like a partner, is he?", "NTA\n\nIf you want to stay married, suggest your husband be the one to go out to work.  There are offices he can rent if his company doesn't have one in your town.  He could rent a room and set up in a boarding house for that matter.\n\nIf you don't want to stay married, husband can leave entirely and never worry about having you around again.", "NTA but I think just for peace of mind get a plan in place. Maybe put up a few nanny cams tell him your going to the office for 3 days then see what he is really up to anybody telling you that you need to be out of your own home something is seriously wrong if this were me i would definitely want to know gotta find out what he is up to while your not home", "NTA\n\nEven during maternity leave and postpartum he wanted you out of the house? Send him back to his parents. Your husband is a huge AH! What does he want to do at home that cannot be done with you in the house?\u2026 does he have an addiction or do you suspect of someone on the side?", "Does he work evenings or work from home also?", "NTA", "NTA.  I hate commuting, its a waste of time, of gas ( or electric) and now that its cold season i also don't want to be picking up bugs from my coworkers. When given the choice, i don't go into the office. But is there any type of compromise so that he can have a little bit of the house to himself? Can you leave the house, say twice a month to do errands for a few hours or take a walk/ hike, and stay local. Or, can you guys just have separate areas of the house ( not sure if its big enough) for work or chill purposes?", "NAH - This is a pretty common issue actually, I have this too with my roommate. He could have been nicer but also not going to ignore the whole viewpoint bias we get here from you. \n\nSimply put, doesn't matter how much I love or adore somebody, I need some time away from EVERYBODY occasionally. I get that now with my roommate by just planning on doing nothing when he's gone fishing for the weekend, simple as that, he does it often enough my needs are fulfilled for alone time. You gotta give that to somebody who needs it. \"This is a HIM problem\" is not the way to go about this, you're married, his problems are your problems. Gotta figure this one out, if going into the office occasionally is the way to do it, mazel tov you have the tools.", "? why is he home all the time to be worried about this?\n\nNTA - because there are much better ways to ask someone to have time alone at home.  Does he wfh too? Is he helping with the baby?", "ESH. It doesn\u2019t sound like he ever gets the house to himself, which is a legitimate thing to want. He wasn\u2019t kind in how he shared his feelings though.", "Maybe he wants the same freedom you get? You get to work from home all day every day by yourself. When he does.. you\u2019re there. I\u2019m not saying he was right in comparing you to a fixture but I get where he\u2019s coming from too in that he doesn\u2019t have the same space when working from home. Another way to think about it is - he works in office with people he works from home with \u201cpeople\u201d. You don\u2019t. At all. You can do whatever you want while working. \n\nA compromise might be you work half days in the office once or twice a month when he\u2019s working from home so he can get that \u201cfreedom\u201d when working from home. \n\nNTA but it\u2019s worth talking to him about why he wants to work from home without you around sometimes. It may just boil down to he wants to work in peace? I know it did for me when my ex would have work cancelled and he was home. It felt like an intrusion even though it wasn\u2019t.", "Hmmm - this one is tricky. Is he an introvert? Are you? I only ask because I am and while I do love my husband, I love an occasional empty house. He WFH 100% of the time and I go into my office 2x a week, WFH the rest of the time. I'm saying NTA because you are literally just existing in your space! I get it. Your husband could have delivered this information in a much better, softer way with perhaps a bit of context. Like he doesn't have to give you a list of what he wants to do while you're out but even if its for a reason like mine (needing the occasional unimpeded quiet and not being beholden to anyone's requests/worries/talking for just a few hours) he needs to say it.   \n\n\nI don't think you need to go into the office if you don't want to. But maybe run some errands that would take a few hours, get some coffee, grab a massage, and he can have some alone-in-the-house time and you also get yourself a little time for yourself? At any rate, NTA", "ESH  he has a valid point, but also really went about it the wrong way.    Everyone needs alone time to recharge.   My wife and I ran into this during lockdown when we both wfh in a 700ft apt.   I was always there she was always there no matter the time or day.  It was a near 100% time spent together.  \n\nI\u2019d say maybe take 1 day a week at the office, make a day of it, go to the office, go out for lunch if you have the means, do some errands on the way home, take your time.   It\u2019ll give your husband the time to mentally recharge at home.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, I do think your husband has a valid concern even if he brought it up in not the nicest way. The desire for some alone time in your shared household.\n\nCould this also be a benefit for you? Being home all the time with him, your son, and the dog doesn\u2019t allow you any alone time either. Maybe once a week/month you two could agree that one of you will work from somewhere other than the house? Something like Mondays I go to the office and Fridays hubby will go work at a cafe or something?", "ESH. He could've worded it better but you are coming across as dismissive here. How is only 1 day at the office a month that bad when you already are always at home so he never has the place to himself like you do? You have to compromise in a marriage, you know", "YTA\n\nHe's asking for one day a month. Give it to him. If you don't want to give him a weekday and commute, then you're going to have to sacrifice a weekend day and be gone 8 ish hours.\n\nIt's clear he wants and needs this, and has started to resent you not listening and blowing him off. Resentment is the marriage killer. So, pick the second Tuesday of the month or something, and make that Office Day.\n\nDig in and refuse? He'll just start leaving and not coming back, while the resentment grows over being dismissed.", "NAH.\n\nLook, maybe it's because I'm a huge introvert, but I get where your husband is coming from.  I only get to WFH 1 day a week anymore, but if my spouse is home on the day I'm WFH, it throws me off.  The house isn't as quiet (even though we each have our own separate work spaces, noise leaks); I can't just pop into the bathroom and leave the door open; I can't blast music; etc.  It just makes it harder to fully relax.  I get it.  I would go absolutely nuts without *some* amount of alone time.\n\nI *also* get not wanting to go into the office just because if you don't have to.  I'd 100% rather be WFH full time than spend any time in the office at all. \n\nI don't feel like 1 day a month is a huge ask, but maybe what about a comprise where you leave the house with kiddo for the better part of the day on a Saturday or Sunday once a month?  It would give your husband a break and let him have his alone time in the house, but wouldn't disrupt the weekly routine with your kid?", "NTA, I suppose you could say the same to him. Why is he so entitled that he gets the house to himself. It is not going to be good retirement years (when the time comes) with that attitude.", "NTA.\n\nIf he wants some alone time, *he* can go out. My wife is currently a SAHM, and I WFH (our company doesn't even have an office), but my wife is happy\\* to have me around almost all the time. With 2 kids under 6, she starts to get agitated only when she knows I'm going to be gone for several days on a business trip.\n\n\\*That's not to say she never fusses at me for <stuff>, but she never suggests that she wants alone time in the house. The closest she comes is if she's really sick and she wants me to sequester the kids to the main floor or basement so she can sleep in peace, which of course if imminently reasonable. She will also occasionally have a half-day out with a friend doing grownup things.", "NTA\nIf you are given the opportunity to wfh full time, which is a blessing, you should be able to do it as much as is available and you want. He should not dictate when you need to be out of the house.\nThat being said, for you own sanity, I do suggest finding some extracurriculars or something to get out and do every so often. Working and living in the same place without a lot of outside interactions can be a recipe for negative mental health. Also, you and he should both get your own alone time, not counting work, just to keep everyone happy and getting along.", "\u2026does your husband even like you?", "Nta\n\nSo he expects you to leave the house WITH your child so he can be alone? \n\nThat man is an embarrassment.", "YTA\n\nOf course he didn\u2019t ask it nicely, but I think it isn\u2019t too much of an effort to work a day in the office once a month to give your husband some space and alone-time if that\u2019s what he really needs. Why would your comfort be more important than his needs?", "YTA he is asking for one day a month and you can't even do that. He wants the house to himself every once in a while. Is this really such a burden that you can't take on to make him happy one day a month.", "NTA\n\nI get maybe wanting alone time and asking you to leave him alone in your bedroom for a while or something like that but the whole house? Calling you, his wife, annoying? Also, I don't want to be that redditor but something isn't adding up with this scenario.", "NTA.  I\u2019m curious as to if he is willing to take the responsibility of caring for your child if he is at home and forces you to go to the office.", "NTA but I wanna know who or what he is doing when you're not around since your presence is such an issue", "You get the house to yourself during the work day 30-40% of the time by my math. Why not give him one day a month to have the same? It sounds like it it's important to him one workday a month isn't a a big ask for something that matters to your partner.", ">I am home a lot, have no extracurriculars (unless you count taking my son to his activities) and no friends close by\n\nYTA\n\nEveryone wants alone time and it can be really difficult when someone is always home with you, even if they are your partner.\n\nOnce a month is super reasonable. It doesn't have to be work, just do something. Go make a friend, start an extra curricular, just something that gets you out of the house for a little bit.\n\nAnd get more than 1 option for socialization. It is bad for your relationship when the only adult you regularly talk to is your husband. That is just a lot of pressure.\n\nSimilarly your husband should be making sure to get out sometimes to give you alone time, and should also be making sure to take an equal part in childcare and housekeeping.", "My partner went back to the office as as covidly possible. He hated working from home, and he hated working in such close proximity to others (me (also WFH) and the kids (SFH)).\n\nNAH. Just try to have a constructive conversation about what you both need and expect.", "I used to know this family. Husband worked from home. Wife was SAHM. Both kids were home schooled. They all had the same hobby, which was taking martial arts at the same dojo. They were always, always all together. Seemed to work for them, they seemed happy!", "NTA but your husband sure is. It's your right to be at home 100% of the time if you want to. If he wants alone time he can leave.

I also think if you really never get out you may have adjusted to this new normal and maybe don't realize how much is missing from your life right now.

My husband is a complete and total gem. But the pandemic sent me around the bend. I was NEVER alone for several YEARS. I don't have anything secret going on. I just wanted to be alone in my house with my things doing whatever I want. It might be eating toast or it might be talking on the phone or it might be zoning out completely in front of the TV. But I don't want to talk to anyone, explain myself, or honestly need to CARE about another person for a little while.\n\nLet's put it this way - I have some time off this week and I am SUPER excited to clean out my closets! Yeah - I am a VERY exciting person!! My sweet husband finds this boring and interrupts me constantly to see if I am ready to do something with him instead. So when I am alone I can do things I like that actually ARE boring without interruption or explanation.\n\nI would also make sure your husband is getting alone time with your child and YOU are getting some time for peace and quiet, too!", "ESH he could word it a bit nicer but it sounds like he has a legitimate request as long as he's returning the favor to you.  You admitted you never leave the house except to visit your family.  Being home alone to do absolutely nothing is a good reset. Even if you are home and not bothering him, it is not the same as leaving the house.  You both need alone time and can communicate it better to one another.", "I\u2019ll be honest- I recently broke up with my long term partner due in large part to a very similar situation. She very rarely left the house, had very little contact with her friends, no hobbies that involved leaving the house, etc. She also constantly pushed for us to spend more dedicated time together for things like dates, but to be honest, I was completely burnt out on being around her all the time.\n\nI\u2019m a huge introvert, and the thought of never having alone time in my own home ever again was a big reason to call it quits. \n\nI think the question is: do you care about his needs, or do you care about being \u201cright\u201d? There\u2019s lots of people on the internet who will defend you and tell you you\u2019re right. But if you want to stay in a relationship with this man, you need to be open minded when he\u2019s expressing a need, not just brush it off.

Cook something, play an instrument. Hell, even just enjoy quiet; alone quiet is very different than when the people there are quiet.\n\nGive him a frickin day a month.\n\nI've live in so many places and kinds of situations. Don't be selfish.", "Softly YTA. Your husband is asking you for a little space, and likely wants you to have a bit more of a life outside of work/family. It\u2019s healthy to have a life outside your home. \n\nHe didn\u2019t communicate very well. The cabinet comment was a little harsh, but I gather he\u2019s feeling frustrated that You. Are. Always.

It wasn't that I didn't enjoy having them around, but constantly having someone around like a cabinet can be incredibly irritating when there is no break, if he never gets the place to himself, etc. I totally get where he is coming from.\n\nIt can't hurt for you to go in to work once a month to allow him this space\n\nNah but maybe consider his request", "ESH hear me out\n\nHe sucks for the way he talked to you and referring to you like furniture, that wasn\u2019t cool whatsoever and he should apologize for speaking to you like that. However, I also understand where he\u2019s coming from and do think you could compromise. Once a month is not a lot, and it would give him a day to himself where he could relax at home alone. I believe he might have reached the end of his rope with that one, and although it\u2019s not an excuse for him to talk to you that way, is staying home on a day you could have gone in once a month worth more than the health of your relationship? \n\nRelationships involve compromise, it sucks to have to get ready and drive but wouldn\u2019t you do that once in a while for someone you love? I see a lot of people saying that it\u2019s also your house, and that\u2019s true, but come on. You could even compromise on once every other month.

Personal space is important for the health of both the individual and the relationship. However he needs to take over childcare on those days.

I do think him criticizing you during your maternity leave was a bit over the top, and calling you \u201ca cabinet\u201d is really awful.", "I'll actually go with ESH. Sure, comparing you to furniture isn't great, but he's frustrated. It IS nice to have your house to yourself once in a while.

But man, was it tough. It\u2019s not about having TO DO something in particular, it\u2019s just the priceless feeling of having the place to yourself. If your husband is an introvert then he needs me time even more. \nIt\u2019s only one day per month, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an absurd request. Still, his delivery wasn\u2019t kind. ESH", "ESH\nHis communication sucks\nThat being said, he probably wants complete alone time maybe one day a week since you said he also leaves the house 30 ish percent of the time, you get that time alone he doesn\u2019t ever get.\nI live with someone, I love them, sometimes I like walking around the house completely alone", "I am currently a third party witness in an almost identical situation so I really hope you see this comment.\n\nAlthough I did think first an E. S. H. was appropriate, the fact that you are stonewalling makes it YTA because there is a communication breakdown/failure with a lack of empathy equally on both sides. Plus, I think this situation could be resolved fairly easily if both of you were talking about and coming at this situation like you aren't attacking/insulting each other.\n\nPeople seriously need space to decompress (especially after the pandemic) and be themselves totally alone at least once in awhile. That is a perfectly reasonable request and I can't stress that enough. \n\nI think both of you are approaching this ass backwards. He's clearly frustrated that he doesn't get a minute to himself in his house and is talking to you about it out of a place of pure frustration. But you not being open or even somewhat empathetic to it is definitely going to make his frustration about this situation worse. \n\nYou wanting to work from the comfort of your own home is also not unreasonable. The unreasonable part is that because you have nothing that takes you outside the house (exception of your son and errands probably) ever, you are not even willing to try and empathize with your husband wanting some space by asking you to physically leave and go into work a few times a month since you have the option.\n\nYou seem real determined that you're in the right so let me try and offer a glimpse at a similar perspective to your husband's via my parents who are dealing with this situation right now. Im just genuinely hoping that you are unlike my Dad and actually care about your spouse's well being and mental health despite what being out of the house a few hours a week costs you. \n\nMy mom has had to change every single detail about how she goes about her daily life to work around the fact that my Dad is now permanently WFH and also doesn't leave the house ever. It doesn't matter how big their house is, and it's big, but sound carries on hardwood and tile.\n\nShe has to adjust cleaning and maintaining the house in every single way so it does not cause a disturbance to him. She can no longer blast her music, sing and dance around while cleaning at all, which is how she made household chores fun for herself the last 30 years or so. And when he's not working he's watching TV so again she can't do this thing she wants to for herself, she can listen on headphones but that still totally minimizes it. She also can't really clean the kitchen until bedtime now because my Dad is in and out of it trashing it multiple times day. \n\nNobody can be in the kitchen at all when he is making lunch or breakfast without it turning into a huge deal, because he's trying to do it as fast as he can between meetings so other people present hinder that and get in his way. It's at the point where if he comes in to make a meal, she will just straight up stop cooking her breakfast/lunch etc even if it's halfway done ON THE STOVETOP and walk out till he's finished bc it's such hassle.  \n\nWhen he is not here the kitchen stays clean for days, she runs the dishwasher twice a week. When he is here it's sometimes twice a day because he won't reuse a plate or a cup or a utensil. \n\nAnd it's also not just that she has to basically cap the level of sound she lives her life at, he is also loud AF during meetings which are multiple times a day and makes as much noise as he wants bc he can and doesn't have to worry about disturbing anyone else. He's not just loud then, the way he stomps instead of walks, slamming doors and cabinets unessacerily hard bc that's just how he does it. The house goes from so loud you can't hear yourself think to being able to hear a pin drop when he is not present. \n\nHe constantly pushes stuff off on my mom using the excuse he WFH so he's too busy to do pretty much anything. He just expects her to do everything, schedules vet appointments and doesn't even ask her if she's available to go, even though she also works part time with a constantly changing schedule.\n\nMaybe you're not loud or messy or completely inconsiderate, but I PROMISE you that your husband has a version of the above about things that you do and he just wants a short break from that time because it is absolutely EXHAUSTING to have to be around someone like that 24/7 ESPECIALLY when they are totally oblivious to how changing from WFH affects everybody in the home.\n\nAnd if you EVER get the house to yourself when he goes out to do anything and won't even consider giving him the same courtesy you are a major AH.\n\nWFH can break the strongest of relationships, and you can totally choose to ignore my advice sure. But i've watched this same shit show long enough to be able to tell you that if you don't come at this from a place of love and find a reasonable compromise to give your spouse the space they need as a human, they will burnout. The resentment and frustration will fester and seep into all parts of your life and your kid(s) will be right there experiencing the fallout of it all with you both.\n\nETA: I saw your comment about saying you were away for a few days and hes still asking. It doesn't matter how long he got, whether you were gone 4 days or a month, especially if this is an outlier (as in not regular or expected) and 95% of the time you are home. There is no regularly scheduled off day that he can expect/rely on to have to himself to look forward to and/or schedule things he wants to do solo. Just pick a day of the week and go in to the office (or just have day out of the house) and ask him to do the same for you if that's something you would like to experience too. This really just comes down to consideration for each other and treating others how you want to be treated.", "He's asking for ONE day a month and you can't even give him that , and you said in another comment you have the house alone yourself 30% of the time., and he has 0, also something seems off with op and her replies, definitely feel like she's really draining or something and she doesn't realises", "NTA.

Read, play games, sleep, work, whatever. I don't need him to leave when I'm home when I can literally just tune him out for a bit. I am not up his ass and he is a grown man who can fend for himself.

There was a time when we both lived/worked downtown, and we agreed that after I had our son remote work would work best - and I didn't even have to request it, as COVID changed the in-office landscape everywhere. \n\nI have no interest in 'winning' at couples counselling. I was only half-joking that we'll have a real solid session with all of this strife/disagreements. I'm sarcastic, sometimes it can't be picked up on via keyboard. \n\nWe both value solo time, and endeavor for our weekends to include that.

My whole life feels like my job is to just be considerate of him because that's what good partners do, but because he's so demanding of staying in our shared space all the time, there's no space for me to just have a break from having to be considerate and think only for myself and plan for myself for a bit. He, on the other hand, gets plenty of time as I go out with my friends 2x a week just to step away and have interest in my life outside of the cycle of eat, sleep, work - not to shade him for being in that cycle, but without friends or hobbies that get him out of the house outside of the couple's events I bring him to, I simply don't get the same experience living in our home that he gets by virtue of our social lives being so different.\n\nIt is exhausting being around someone 24/7 and never feeling like you have the space to smell your own farts without them around the corner watching, listening, and caring about it, or them telling you to do that somewhere else.

It\u2019s 3 bedroom, a livingroom, dining room, kitchen, hallway, entrance, bathroom, has a big shed and a nice garden. In order to even qualify for this home, you\u2019d need at least 2 children, and my single mom got it assigned when she had me (last baby out of two), but there\u2019s no rules about kicking renters out, just because said kids grown up and eventually move out. My situation is quite different but having lived here for over 2 decades, they allowed me to take over the house. \n\nNow, at first I wanted to downsize, but there\u2019s a ton of stuff to go through so instead, my BF of 8 yrs now are going to be moving in. It\u2019s frankly a dream house for our needs; we can have our own personal room and a shared bedroom. We LOVE each others company and spend lots of time together. His room isn\u2019t ready to move his stuff in just yet, so officially he doesn\u2019t live here yet but is staying over 90% of the time. I do t think he has slept in his own apartment for the past 9 months.\n\nThis summer he started going to his moms place for like 3-4 days in a row (she still has his old bedroom as a guest room with a bed) which leaves me home alone. I have a office type of job where I can work from home almost everyday, tho my boss prefers when we come in once or twice a week. \n\nWell, I never knew how much it actually took up my mental space to have my BF I just IN the house when I\u2019d be working on my computer, at the other end of the livingroom, which has the dining room as a room between the bedroom where he sleeps, so quite a distance, two doors and a few corners keeps us apart, but *mentally* he is always at the back of my mind. \n\nAfter he started going to his moms regularly (once or twice a month for days in a row) I suddenly got some unknown weight off my shoulders. Mind you, there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m doing on his days away, that I couldn\u2019t easily do when he is here, but somehow there\u2019s a blockage. I often spend those alone days cooking a recipe I know he doesn\u2019t like (he has assured me and encourages me to still try those recipes when he is around, just for myself and he will handle his own dinner, but I still have an invisible barrier keeping me from doing it).\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because us living together is quite new but we are also both quite introverts, but regardless of how much I love having him around, a part of me plans random stuff for the days he is away. As a side note, in the weekends, I often awake 4 hours before him and thus has the entire house to myself. I\u2019ll close the bedroom door and somehow those hours are my most available to be productive. I\u2019ve always hated having eyes on me when doing things and I think it has translated into another human being within my own proximity. Other times, I spend the solitude on just absolutely nothing but it clears my head and soothes my body & mind in a way I don\u2019t experience when my loved one is near this much. \n\nI wonder if your husband has some mentally invisible blockades that keeps him from doing what he wants, when you are around? It probably has nothing to do with \u2018you\u2019 but merely a persons presence. Maybe you can consider working in office once every 2 weeks, or spend a half-workday at a library or cafe or coffee shop. Make a note of what parenting duties you usually do on days you\u2019re home, which is these instances would be on your husband to do, and lay it out for him that in order for you to be outside of home working, he needs to do XYZ with kiddo.

Maybe occasionally work from a coffee shop or some other place with free wifi. That way you don't have to commute all three way to work and he can have some alone time. \n\nIm in a somewhat similar situation to your husband.  I WFH 100%. My wife used to go into work every day. I loved having that alone time every day.  She switched jobs and is now also 100% remote. I love this too, my wife and I get to see each other more,  we eat lunch together,  breaks sometimes include quickies, and most importantly she is so much happier and that makes me happier. Still,  i missed that alone time and it led to me staying up late at night most nights to try to get some semblence of being alone in the house. My wife on her own started going to coffee shops so now i get the best of both worlds", "NAH.\n\nI\u2019m an extreme extrovert and even still, having a young child and wife around similar ages to your family\u2026 I just want them the heck away from me for a hot second every now and then too. \n\nYou guys can come up with something that satisfies everybody here, I\u2019m quite sure.", "Do you share your thoughts with him a lot? I ask because I feel this way with my spouse sometimes, but it's because I can't just be in my head.

HE NEEDS TO GET OUT!!", "Info: how does your telework affect the house? Is the soundproofing poor such that from your workspace, you\u2019d hear if he blasted music or played video games with friends on a headset?? Is your camera angles such that he can\u2019t walk around in PJs or do dishes for fear of messing up your meeting??\n\nWhen my ex switched to telework, it was my personal hell, but that\u2019s because he insisted on teleworking in the living room of the first floor, which was an open floor plan. I had to make sure I looked professional before coming downstairs (even if I didn\u2019t have meetings and he did), if I was taking a sick day I had to use headphones to watch TV, and I couldn\u2019t even do dishes without him complaining about the noise. Even if I hid upstairs, he\u2019d complain about the sound carrying if I took a phone call while I was on a meeting.\n\nYou may want to ask how your being home affects him, because size of home matters a lot less than layout and how sound travels.", "If I worked from home with my gf, we wouldn\u2019t get any work done lmao", "Doesn't matter how big the house is. Sometimes people want to be completely alone and that's fine. Only 4 days out of the year sounds suffocating. I NEED my husband to be out and away from me bc he works from home. I don't want to have to answer questions or validate whatever I'm doing. \n\nEveryone saying this is suspicious is delusional.

I wfh full time. Five months in a house together. She comes into my office, dressed for work. \u201cAre you going to miss me?\u201d she asks, so sweetly, so demurely. \n\nI looked straight into her soul. \u201cGet. The f**k. Out. Of. My. House.\u201d \n\nlol\n\nI get where your husband is coming from. Also, you need some adult interaction that\u2019s not him. An office might do you good.

Maybe he needs to mediate, maybe he needs to jack off until his dick is raw.  But what ever it is, he needs it.  My wife is an introvert, we both work at home and have since the Rona landed.  I make a point to give her space.  I have the option of going to an empty office and choose to do so regularly.  We each take separate trips for a night or weekend somewhere nearby, again just to have some time to really be alone.

He might need this too. \n\nThe root of the issue, and why I go with YTA, is that you don't seem to be listening and he doesn't seem to be putting it delicately. It might be because you're tired of hearing it and he's tired of saying it. In the end he's communicating a need to you and you're ignoring it because it's not a need you have. This isn't a way to be partners or even friends. Talk to him and listen. Tell him the burden it puts on you and maybe he'd be willing to help you with it. Why are you doing drop off all the time maybe he can do it and you do pick up.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t matter how much you love your partner, alone time is crucial for some people to maintain mental health and good relationships. No one wants to be with their partner all the time.

He doesn't stay in one of the 4 bedrooms to work..he paces incessantly from the bedroom, to the kitchen, to the back patio, to the laundry room (why?), then garage.  Then starts the cycle again.\n\nI can't do any projects I enjoyed, because I might make noise. I can't sneak a stealth pair of new jeans, or presents, because he gets every.single.package the moment it arrives. He cleans the fridge religiously (anything older than 3 days is gone).

You can't give him one day?? \n\nThere is seriously something unhealthy with your need to be home if you can't spend one day out of thirty out of your house. Your poor husband never gets the place to himself. I'm a teacher, so over the summer I'm home all day. My husband loves it, but towards the end of my breaks he also starts to feel a little suffocated, so I make sure to go visit friends or something to give him his space for the day.

Maybe allow a couple days for him to gather his thoughts, then another conversation to discuss solutions.\n\nIs it the noise? Is it that you work in the \u201ccommon space\u201d so he feels like he never gets non-work time alone to relax, or that he feels cramped in his home office and thus needs to work in the common space but gets distracted by you? Is it actually underlying anxiety about y\u2019all not going out more to concerts, restaurants, etc post-baby and he\u2019s concerned y\u2019all are getting \u201cboring\u201d? Does he actually want to do a sport or hobbit or something but feels like you\u2019ll guilt him for taking time away from the family, which is why he wants you to have something out of the house too?\n\nI don\u2019t know. But this may lead to bigger discussions about your communication and other topics, or maybe it\u2019s a simple fix (noise-cancelling headphones, date nights, etc). \n\nBut you should both be looking for solutions, especially ones within your own control. Like you going into the office seems to only be a negative for you (long commute, no pup, more difficult to coordinate daycare, clothing), so it\u2019d be unfair to say this is the *only* solution. Perhaps you both could take turns going into a local shared work space (cafe, library) - like he goes M/W mornings and you go T/Th afternoons - to get time \u201caway\u201d from each other. You can still bring your dog, be close by, dress more casually. Perhaps look into \u201cpimping\u201d his space so he has his own bathroom, brighter lighting, mini fridge, microwave, soundproofing, etc and doesn\u2019t need to go to the common area - or do the same for you. Could you convert the garage or make a nice space in the backyard? Maybe talk about \u201cdo not disturb\u201d signs/times, noise-cancelling headphones, etc. \n\nI feel like there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to find something you both are okay with.

So obv she understands the appeal.", "I'm an adult only child, I cannot express how draining it is to remember that people with siblings don't find it normal just just walk out of a room without explaining. It does not make sense to me and a few hours alone where I don't have to worry about that is glorious.", "He's also calling her furniture. Which is firmly asshole territory", "My ex-fiance got upset with me when I told him I liked forward to Thursdays because he always worked a double on Thursdays and I knew I would get alone time. He took that to mean I didn't love him, when it really just meant that I'm an introvert and though he mostly didn't count as \"people\" I still needed actual alone time to regain social energy. \n\nI should've seen them that it wasn't going to work out (for many reasons), but at least I got out before there was an actual wedding, lol.", "It\u2019s that. He\u2019s not cheating. Just wants to go through his work day solo. With me nowhere in the house. I get it.", "I feel like a lot of this subreddit where they want everything to be a soap opera with big dramatic reveals and secrets and affairs and that happens a decent amount but in real life there's a ton of situations where there's not much drama and the issue is two people with a minor conflict that can be resolved with communication and understanding. So I feel like there's this disconnect where the sub is gonna go to the outlandish when the answer is simplistic and understabdable", "If my husband was home every single day and we never got a break from each other, I\u2019m sure both of us would find it hard to spend intentional time with each other or have the opportunity to miss each other. You\u2019ve outright dismissed his needs here, but by forcing him to continue to be around you all the time and never giving him a break I imagine it will only make it harder to fulfil your needs of closeness.", "Why should he care about your needs when you completely dismiss his needs? Self centered much?", "I just posted similar. I would love alone time in my own house. However my husband's always home.  I hate it.", "I remember my boyfriend coming over early one day as a surprise and didn't tell me. I was so annoyed that I didn't get my 2 hours of alone time as I'd planned, I was actually kinda rude to him about it and he was surprised I wasn't more excited to see him. That hour after I get home to just exist as a person and not an employee or a girlfriend or a mom is vital.", "Man I feel this. Sometimes I just leave the house because I don\u2019t want to be around my girlfriend anymore when we\u2019ve both been working from home. It\u2019s like babe I love you, but also if one of us doesn\u2019t leave for a while I\u2019m going to pull out my own hair. I have to have alone time. She doesn\u2019t have any hobbies so sometimes it feels like I\u2019m her only source of entertainment. Sometimes you just want to be alone for a while.", "I suspect this is exactly why OP doesn\u2019t get it. She already does have the house completely to herself  30-40% of work hours. Since he\u2019s not there 24/7, she naturally takes all that alone time for granted,  at least a little bit. She may also just not be the kind of person who values alone time as much as her husband does.\n\nI didn\u2019t really myself, until my late twenties at least.", "she already gets it 30-40% of the time by what she said. The dude just wants one day a month which is more than fair", "Yes, you said something sweet to your husband, OP's husband complained she was like a piece of furniture \ud83e\ude91Edit:Nix the \ud83e\ude91! He said she was like a \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f lol", "My husband will literally open the door to tell me I'm being weird closing it, or to check to make sure I'm OK and not becoming sick.\n\nETA not sure why this is downvoted, I don't mind someone checking on me. I know he'd hold my hair if I was vomiting.", "I know it's a different situation for me, but I feel this. After I got out of a bad relationship, my mom was gracious enough to let me come back home for a few years to rebuild my finances and mental health. I'm getting ready to move into my own place now, and I just *cannot wait* to be alone.\n\n I love my mom and we get along great, but she's always home and often I just don't want to interact with anyone. I just want to go grab a snack or something and not have to talk to or see anyone. I'm definitely the kind of person who needs true alone time to really unwind! If i had a partner that did WFH full time and rarely left the house, I think I'd lose my mind eventually \ud83d\ude05", "Loud gamer partners should come with finished shed game-cave lairs in the back yard with sound insulation.", "By having to take the 4 year old wherever she goes, she doesn't get alone time, either. Her husband needs to grow the fuck up. If he wants alone time, he can...go to work like he's asking HER to do.", "Never heard of Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks but I'll be sure to credit him/them now \ud83d\ude0a", "She isn't asking for alone time though, is she?  He is.  He doesn't need to grow up, he needs alone time where he presumably feels most comfortable, in the house.  \nHe does go to work.  She said he works from home 60-70% of the time.  He is in the office the other 30-40%", "Can you explain how he can get alone time at work when he's surrounded by other people ? You make no sense at all"]}
