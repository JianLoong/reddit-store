It\u2019s not yours or your mom\u2019s responsibility to clean up after her. She\u2019s an adult and needs to do her part to keep shit clean, especially in shared spaces. She knows you and your mom will clean up after her and she\u2019s taking advantage of the situation. Not fair to either of you. No one else would be as kind as her family so she should learn from this situation and grow up and learn some responsibility.\n\nEdit to add: your sister doesn\u2019t seem to understand the stress she is adding to your mom, who is still in her corner and trying to maintain peace among your family. She should do better not just for you but especially for your mom.", "Nta", "NTA", " NTA.  You are a sister, not a maid.  I feel so bad for your mother.\n\nMy daughter turned into quite a slob in high school.  Like your mother I did not want to have screaming fights.  What I did instead was put a large box inside her bedroom door.  Any of her stuff, books, toys, homework, clothes, dirty dishes, went in the box.  I didn't have to clean up after her and when she would say \"I can't find X\" then I would refer her to the box.  Yep, kind of gross, but it worked for us.", "Yeah, it's frustrating cause nothing seems to work... But sometimes I prefer to pick up after my sister than to have my mom come home exhausted to a mess of a house", "They do, but again, my mom's priority atm is too maintain the peace at home, so she tries to avoid arguing even if arguing is kinda necessary", "We have talked to her about it, the thing is that my sister truly believes that my mom loves her less. This is because argues with her way more and it is the reason why she compares herself with me a lot. She does not seem to understand that this is not love related, but the fact that she gives my mom a lot of work when she is already exhausted. I don't know what to do to help my sister...", "OP NTA. I don't blame you wanting to move out and time for you to do you now. You are not her cleaning personnel", "Seems easier for you and your mom to stop cleaning. What's the point of having high standards if it just means more work for yourself?", "Maybe your sister should move out lol", ">But sometimes I prefer to pick up after my sister than to have my mom come home exhausted to a mess of a house\n\nUnderstood, but that is the root of your problem.  Neither of you should have to pick up after an adult.", "OP, How long until you believe that you can move out?", "You\u2019re right, it\u2019s not love related. It\u2019s common to be competitive with siblings. Is she the youngest? Babies in the family tend to get a lot more leniency. Maybe she needs things spelled out for her, like a list of chores to do, if she\u2019s never really had to pull her weight. Ultimately though it\u2019s not your job to make sure your sister is a functioning adult. So do what you need to do if she\u2019s not willing to make any changes. I wish you all a peaceful resolution.", "I'm not sure, money is tight rn and I'm finishing my masters degree. I am starting an internship in a month, so I would hope to get hired after that and start saving money. I feel sad to want to move out tho, I love my mom and sister dearly but the situation affects me everyday", "Oh, Then ESH\nIt sounds like it will be several months, for moving fees, rent, first month's rent etc, to be saved up. You openly and plainly complained about someone who you say is very dramatic to being criticized. And you still have months to go before you can do anything about it. She sounds like a mess, and is the mess. But you made it messier", "NTA\n\n\n\nMakes sense that you're bloody tired of having to deal w another person's mess constantly. \n\n\nAnd to whoever comments stuff like \"what's the point of saying that?\", how would you feel cleaning everything up and then returning from work/school/etc exhausted to a dirty and messy place?", "NTA. Her messiness is the result of your mother's failure as a parent. Not hard punishing a kid until they start behaving. Take away the internet, their phone, their devices, going out with their friends. Eventually they will comply. You should move out though.", "NTA. When my stepson moved in, he was the same. That much detritus and food mess leaves me anxious. Luckily, he's improved faster than your sister has.", "NTA. I'm in a pretty much identical situation as you, it's frustrating and heartbreaking to see our mothers deal with the extra stress when they're already working their asses off, so we take it on for our moms and just adds more work for ourselves and so much resentment towards our sibling. I've tried countless conversations with my brother cleaning up his own messes and it always ends up with him acting like he's being victimized and forced to do something unthinkable. You're not wrong at all for saying what you did and for your own sake moving out when you can is definitely the best move. But I feel your pain dude, it's not a fun situation. Thanks for sharing, it's kinda comforting that someone is going through something so similar to me", "nta", "Is there also something going on with your sister that might be impacting this? is she generally feeling down? has she always struggled with organization?   \n\n\nMaybe you've already exhausted this but saying \"look we love you but there is a certain amount of work in the house and when other people have to take on your share of that work it creates resentment and I think that is the resentment that youre noticing that makes you feel like youre less loved. You are not less loved and it is not about you as a person but it is about the work you are leaving for others. Mom is exhausted and really needs both our help.\"", "I feel that tidying up during a hurricane feeling.  It\u2019s how my kids and husband are.  For a while I was working 4 days a week so I had a day to clean and the. I would go to a crochet group for 2 hours.  When I got home it looked like I didn\u2019t do anything.  It was so depressing.", "This is perfect. Maybe a week of this would get the point across, maybe not, but you\u2019d spend lots less time cleaning up her mess and your mom would be less stressed.", "Go ahead and pick up all her crap she leaves in public spaces, and dump ALL OF IT inside her bedroom door. Trash, clothes, dirty dishes, *all of it*.\n\nIt'll be out of your mom's way, and will make sister's life more difficult. Of she doesn't want it piled in her room, she can clean it up herself", "Yeah they\u2019re living in a no win situation where they either throw their hands in the air and stop cleaning and have to live in a state of disaster and resentment or they are just always cleaning up after the messy sister. It really doesn\u2019t matter what they\u2019re going to do, resentment is going to build and it\u2019s going to lead to tension and further arguments and a strain on the relationship.", "NTA", "This isn\u2019t about wanting to move out, it\u2019s about communication. You delivered the message poorly and are now trying to justify that based on the living arrangements. But the living arrangements and the communication are two different things.\n\nJust be the bigger person and apologize for not communicating well. You don\u2019t need to keep justifying your desire to move out, or criticizing your sister\u2019s behavior, or change your point of view, or change theirs. Just say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I communicated badly.\u201d", "NTA- People move out all the time regardless of reasoning. I\u2019m a messy guy but even I clean after myself, the only place that I let get messy is my room but only because I sleep there and nobody really enters my room except me. \n\nI don\u2019t think it is bad for wanting to move out for such reason.", "NTA. Also, your sister might have ADHD. If she does, treatment could make it easier for her to be tidier.", "I will try to talk my mom into doing this! She has kind of given up on trying to find a solution, and I am usually a bit harsher about it, I have even argued with my mom a couple times. We both want the situation to change, but if only I do this kind of things I will be the bad guy because \"I am not her mom\"", "Are you trying anything now to deal with the situation? I have now started throwing anything of hers that I find in her bedroom, so the work she gives is reducing to doing a few chores that she should do herself. It at least takes less time.", "I actually have done that a couple of times! It was funny seeing her reaction to finding a toaster full of crumbs in her room", "Hmmm, I wouldn't say something going on maybe, I think the resentment of her feeling like she is less loved is what leads to more talking back on her side when my mom yells at her more than any other thing. She has always had the need to say the last word in things. When my dad lived with us the fights were horrible because they both had that tendency and conflicts would get worse instead of scaling down.\nSome of the serious, nice talks we had with her led to \"yeah I know\", but most had led to \"you are both exaggerating so much it's just a couple things out of place\". It really isn't. There wouldn't be this much conflict if it was."]}
