It\u2019s not yours or your mom\u2019s responsibility to clean up after her. She\u2019s an adult and needs to do her part to keep shit clean, especially in shared spaces. She knows you and your mom will clean up after her and she\u2019s taking advantage of the situation. Not fair to either of you. No one else would be as kind as her family so she should learn from this situation and grow up and learn some responsibility.\n\nEdit to add: your sister doesn\u2019t seem to understand the stress she is adding to your mom, who is still in her corner and trying to maintain peace among your family. She should do better not just for you but especially for your mom.", "Nta", "NTA", " NTA.  You are a sister, not a maid.  I feel so bad for your mother.\n\nMy daughter turned into quite a slob in high school.  Like your mother I did not want to have screaming fights.  What I did instead was put a large box inside her bedroom door.  Any of her stuff, books, toys, homework, clothes, dirty dishes, went in the box.  I didn't have to clean up after her and when she would say \"I can't find X\" then I would refer her to the box.  Yep, kind of gross, but it worked for us.", "Yeah, it's frustrating cause nothing seems to work... But sometimes I prefer to pick up after my sister than to have my mom come home exhausted to a mess of a house", "They do, but again, my mom's priority atm is too maintain the peace at home, so she tries to avoid arguing even if arguing is kinda necessary", "We have talked to her about it, the thing is that my sister truly believes that my mom loves her less. This is because argues with her way more and it is the reason why she compares herself with me a lot. She does not seem to understand that this is not love related, but the fact that she gives my mom a lot of work when she is already exhausted. I don't know what to do to help my sister...", "OP NTA. I don't blame you wanting to move out and time for you to do you now. You are not her cleaning personnel", "Seems easier for you and your mom to stop cleaning. What's the point of having high standards if it just means more work for yourself?", "Maybe your sister should move out lol", ">But sometimes I prefer to pick up after my sister than to have my mom come home exhausted to a mess of a house\n\nUnderstood, but that is the root of your problem.  Neither of you should have to pick up after an adult.", "OP, How long until you believe that you can move out?", "You\u2019re right, it\u2019s not love related. It\u2019s common to be competitive with siblings. Is she the youngest? Babies in the family tend to get a lot more leniency. Maybe she needs things spelled out for her, like a list of chores to do, if she\u2019s never really had to pull her weight. Ultimately though it\u2019s not your job to make sure your sister is a functioning adult. So do what you need to do if she\u2019s not willing to make any changes. I wish you all a peaceful resolution.", "I'm not sure, money is tight rn and I'm finishing my masters degree. I am starting an internship in a month, so I would hope to get hired after that and start saving money. I feel sad to want to move out tho, I love my mom and sister dearly but the situation affects me everyday", "Oh, Then ESH\nIt sounds like it will be several months, for moving fees, rent, first month's rent etc, to be saved up. You openly and plainly complained about someone who you say is very dramatic to being criticized. And you still have months to go before you can do anything about it. She sounds like a mess, and is the mess. But you made it messier"]}
