I put a lot of effort into birthdays (including his) and was pretty excited about it for the last month or so. There is a local bakery that makes a really good-looking pineapple upside down cake. I have been really wanting to try it and have been saving it for my birthday. About a month in advance, I told him my birthday was coming up and gave him a few activity ideas, and told him that I didn't need a gift but I really wanted a pineapple upside down cake from XYZ Bakery, he said \"sure.\"\n\nNow...I know this was probably annoying, but I did mention this specific cake several times, even before last month. Like we would drive by the bakery and I'd say something like \"Oh hey that's the place with the pineapple cake, I wanna do that for my birthday.\" I wasn't deliberately hammering the point home or anything (or aware that it was gonna end in a cake-centered conflict), but there were a couple occasions where it came up. And then a week before my birthday I did text him a reminder about the cake so that he would have the bakery info on hand.\n\nYesterday rolls around and my boyfriend comes over to my apartment and gives me a gift, which is a Kindle. Not a bad gift and I know they are expensive, but not something particularly relevant to me either. Then he says let's have cake, and presents what you all know by now is *not* the pineapple upside down cake, but just a regular grocery store cake with the frosting balloons. Vanilla cake with vanilla buttercream. You guys, I was legitimately sad. If I knew he was gonna drop the ball on this, I would have just gotten myself a pineapple cake months ago instead of waiting. I was on the verge of tears because of not getting the one thing I actually wanted which was that stupid cake, so I told him I was very disappointed and that he should just go home. He had two tickets to a comedy show for that night and one ended up going to waste. Now he's annoyed because it is of course \"just a cake\" and wants me to reimburse the cost of the wasted ticket. It was only about $30, but I'm bristling at the principal of it and said I didn't owe him the money.

You didn't hint. You flat out told him what you wanted, and he ignored it. Not saying leave him, but that screams minimal effort. Talk to him about it, and he can eat that $30", "NTA- I'm sick of boyfriends/husbands getting a pass on BS like this. You clearly told him what you wanted and then he didn't even get the cake! You asked for one thing and he couldn't even do that right.", "NTA. You asked for 1 thing, and not getting it is understandably disappointing. Your reaction is understandable. He just straight up ignored what you requested, it would be different (not necessarily better), if he waited too long and the bakery couldn't get the cake on time, but he planned to get you a kindle (a gift which you apparently neither need nor want). He didn't forget, he went directly against your stated desires intentionally. Don't pay him back, he's the one that put the ticket to waste with his actions, not you.", "NTA You specifically told him you wanted the cake from that bakery. Did you need to tattoo it on his hand so he'd remember? I am not sure if he needs better listening skills or if he is disrespectful, but if y'all want to stay together, he needs to take a much more ACTIVE role in your conversations. \n\nJust as an example, back when my son was 15, he didn't have a job or a lot of money, but he was a thoughtful kid. So he asked one of the guys I worked with if he could make 10 bucks doing something to help him out, my coworker was willing to give the kid 10 bucks, so they did the task and my son got paid. A few weeks later, on Mother's Day, he surprised me with my favorite chocolates and a card. That was why he wanted to earn the money. I had only told him one time what my favorite chocolate was, (single mom, suoer tight budget) and had not had any in quite a while. I know for a fact that he treats his girfriend the same way. That is how a boyfriend/partner should act when it comes to things that you mention, several times.  (Honestly, it seems like the boys who have bern raised by single mothers are a lot more intuitive and empathetic than ones who grow up in the good old \"nuclear family\" environment. That is simply my personal observation, there are probably plenty of examples of horrible people raised by a single mom.)\n\nI am really sorry you were so disappointed on your birthday, but, now you don't need an excuse, go buy that cake and share with NOBODY! ...well, unless you want to of course. You can totally have a \"Very Merry Unbirthday\" all by yourself.", "NTA. Why are you dating a guy who doesn\u2019t listen to you? Does he make you happy in other ways?

He\u2019s definitely not listening to what you\u2019re saying or understanding what\u2019s important to you and what\u2019s not. Seems menial but turns into big things down the line usually. And him asking for the cost of the ticket that was meant as a gift is a bit much too in my opinion. I\u2019d send him a text and literally spell Thai all out for him and why you were so emotional over it all. \n\nHappy belated Birthday!!", "NTA - you specifically asked for this one thing and he didn\u2019t deliver. \n\nIMO Birthday gifts aren\u2019t as much about the item as they are a demonstration of your listening and \u201cseeing\u201d that person.", "NTA\n\nForget all the cake stuff, the AH opportunity was the comedy show in question. Presumably, this was also a gift to you as it was an event for your birthday. If you don't want to go cause he messed up your cake, or because you're not in a funny mood, or because you'd rather do something else you can. In my view, when someone gifts tickets to an event, the gift is the *choice* to go for free, not the obligation to attend. \n\nUnless his middle name is ticketmaster, I wouldn't expect to be hit with an erroneous \"I-feel-disappointed-on-my-not-birthday\" fee on that ticket stub.", "NTA and the bar for men is on the floor. How hard is it to buy a pineapple cake?", "NTA. You asked for one small thing, and he decided he knew better.", "NTA. You were so specific. You\u2019re allowed to be upset when someone disappoints you. All the people who are saying ESH because you got so upset about a cake don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s not about the cake. It\u2019s about him not listening to you or not caring about making your birthday what you wanted. It\u2019s your birthday. You shouldn\u2019t have to put on a happy face and go to a comedy show to appease the feelings of the person who hurt your feelings. And you definitely shouldn\u2019t have to reimburse him for the tickets when it was his fault you were too upset to go.", "NTA, I know all too well how it feels when you've practically put a neon sign in front of them and they ignore it.  It sucks and I'm sorry.  Him asking for reimbursement is pretty tacky.", "NTA", "No NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to listen to your partner when they make comments like you did.\n\nBesides, the comedy show has nothing to do with the cake. For whatever reason, you did not attend. I assume the comedy show was something he planned to pay for as a birthday activity, so why would you be responsible for that cost whether you went or not?", "INFO:  What did he say when you asked him \"why didn't you get me the pineapple upside down cake\"?", "NTA. You asked for something very inexpensive compared to the gifts he got you, and you made it very clear that you wanted this specific thing. He disregarded everything you said and has the audacity to ask you to reimburse him like you\u2019re a department store.", "NTA. You asked for the bare minimum and instead of getting you what you DIRECTLY TOLD HIM you wanted, he did simething else. That's weird. Was the cake prohibitively expensive or something? Does the bakery ask for a certain timeframe to order the cake for it to be ready and he missed it?", "NTA I'd end it over something like this. He even got himself a present for your bday.", "NTA, but this relationship is probably dead. If he won't listen to you about this, what about bigger issues down the line?", "NTA you made it a point to tell him multiple times im sorry", "Damn, all the unabashed terrible gift givers coming out of the woodwork for this one. NTA", "This isn't about the cake at all.. \n\nThis is about your bf that don't give a shit about what you say... you spend MONTHS telling him in FRONT of the bakery and pointing that you wanted a specific cake and he actually ended buying the wrong cake of a random bakery? Hell no... He had ONE JOB and he failed in it..\n\nThis shows where your importance to him stands in his priorities... he in the end is angry because he spend 30$ and want reimburse? Go tell this MF to fuck himself... WTF .. even i am upset now.", "Info: Did you ask him to buy the tickets?\n\nIf you didn't, YNTA.\n\nHappy birthday, BTW. I hope you buy the cake you want.", "NTA\n\nHow hard is it to follow instructions? It is just pure laziness on his behalf.", "NTA. Life\u2019s too short to date someone who thinks they know what you want more than you do.", "NTA. You seem to have very clearly stated what you wanted and he, either because he didn\u2019t care/listen or thinks he knows better, got you something else. It\u2019s not a great indicator for the future of your relationship, tbh.", "NTA\n\nYou gave him specific instructions. He failed them, not through a mistake, but seemingly a lack of interest.", "NTA. You specifically told him the cake you wanted and where to get it, if he felt like he couldn\u2019t do that simple task he should have said something. \n\nI completely understand where you\u2019re coming from. You were craving that cake and super excited about having it for your birthday only to be let down and at this point it\u2019s no longer just about the cake. It\u2019s his lack of effort and care to get you the one thing you asked for. \n\nFor my last birthday I told my husband I wanted a chocolate cake with raspberry filling and chocolate fudge icing from Publix and he got me the cake because he knew what it meant to me and knew it would make me happy.", "NTA at all! But definitely get a new boyfriend.", "NTA. It's kind of about the cake, but mostly it's about him not listening to you after you *explicitly told him several times what you wanted* and then him ignoring you. It's perfectly logical to be disappointed when your partner shows that they don't make as much an effort for you as you do for them (you made him *cannolli*??? gurl toss him in the trash he doesn't deserve you)", "NTA\n\nRegardless of the whole backstory, he shouldn't make you pay for your own birthday cake.  Is he going to Venmo you to pay for the Kindle next?", "NTA. You were clear you wanted pineapple upside down cake (which is better than vanilla, I made one last week). If ge wasn't going to get you the cake you wanted you could have gotten it yourself.", "NTA\n\nYour bf demonstrated that he\u2019s not paying attention to your wants, in an area of life where your wants should prevail within reason.

Why can't they just say what they're thinking? We're not mind readers!\n\nGirls: I'd love a pineapple upside-down cake for my birthday. Literally just the cake would make me so happy.

So he's clearly TAH.\nBut you know he doesn't understand that the reason of your tears is not a cake. If you have a childhood trauma maybe you should consider a therapy. Not because of your boyfriend but because it would make your life much easier.\nAlso you should talk in a calm way and explain your position if you want to stay a couple.", "I get you.\nI get sad on my birthday too when disappointed.\nEspecially when I make myself clear on expectations (nothing major but always something that makes me feel \"seen\").\n\nYour boyfriend is kinda AH because of the reimbursement stuff, I understand his frustrated because from his point of view he did make an effort but he still failed you on a test he didn't realize was a test of listening.\n\nYou should speak with him when cooled down and clear the air.\nWorse send him the 30$ and a goodbye.", "Info: did you ask him why he didn\u2019t get the cake you mentioned repeatedly wanting? And did you ask him the thought process behind the kindle? Give him a chance to explain, if there was reason, why he went off base on these items. The unfortunate reality is while you put a lot of effort into birthdays and gifts as you said, not everyone does. How aware is he of you feeling as though you are repeatedly let down by things? And assuming he knows, how does he respond to this information. There is a possibility that gift giving and birthdays aren\u2019t a big deal to him so he went about your birthday as he would his own. Unfortunately I am assuming he knows the same information you gave us and that is when you need to have a conversation with him about expectations and why he chose to be another in a long line of people to disappoint you.", "Hard to decide between NTA and ESH: it depends on how clear you made it to him. If you actually asked him to buy it and he didn\u2019t, then he\u2019s an asshole. If you hinted at it, or said it was one of the things you would like, then you should just have been clearer. Because as others have said, a pineapple cake isn\u2019t a typical birthday cake so it\u2019s not the first thing you think of. Besides, some people (like me) want to surprise their SO. So something that you\u2019ve already talked about a hundred times is a bit boring to give as a gift.\n\nIm a guy and tbh, whether it was my fault or not, I would be really pissed if I went through all this effort and my gf would be this angry. If it\u2019s just a 10 month relationship I would break up with her on the spot.", "I may get dragged for this, but I kind of feel like this is an ESH.  He sucks because he should have gotten you the cake you wanted, and he was an idiot that he didn't.  But, it does come across as poor taste to make this big of a fuss about this.  You basically ruined your own birthday over cake.  I don't fault you for being disappointed, but I just don't think that this was handled very maturely.", "ESH, I say this with love because I understand the feeling. It\u2019s hard not to get disappointed on your birthday (especially when my love language is gift giving) but I think you handled it poorly. For reasons obvious to us all I think he sucks for being so uncaring and thoughtless, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to kick someone out of your house and cancel plans over receiving the wrong cake. You still received a kindle and a cake, they may not be the perfect gifts for you but they are still things you should show appreciation for. You should have been gracious then had a chat later on about it. \n\nAs advice for the future: never expect anyone else to do something special for your birthday. Saves a lot of heartache, and makes for the most meaningful moments. Everything that does happen is a pleasant surprise, and everything that doesn\u2019t, do it for yourself!", "INFO: Did you say \"I want this cake for my birthday?\" or did you just keep mentioning how much you like upside down pineapple cake from that bakery? To some people the only \"birthday cake\" is the traditional.....well.....birthday cake.", "DUMP HIM!!

It sounds like you didn't give him the chance to \\*make it right\\* and he was still very thoughtful and generous.\n\nI am sorry, but Y.T.A. You should have given him a chance rather than tell him you were disappointed and to go home. If you allowed him to comfort you at least, maybe you could have made yourself feel better and go to the comedy show with him.\n\nEdited: Oops, my reply was so long I forgot about the him charging you for the ticket. I don't think he should be doing that so I guess I will change to ESH. \n\nDon't pay him back btw, that was a gift, but also realize that no matter how much \\*hinting\\* (or flat out telling him) you do, no one is actually obligated to get you the specific thing you want.

I'd much rather forgo gift giving entirely for big occasions. If someone gets me some perfect gift, while it is great, it also adds stress and pressure on me to do the same. It is it entirely possible that after all of the effort you put in for his birthday, coupled with all of the hints, pressure and suggestions led to making him anxious and screwing up the cake thing because he was worried about so many other things around your birthday?  \nMaybe there was something going on in your bfs life that he didn't have time to run to this specific bakery, maybe the bakery hours conflicted with his work, maybe it ran out of that cake? \n\nIf you only do nice things for other people with the expectation that they will do nice things for you in kind you will always be disappointed.\n\nNot every person you date will be great at everything in a relationship. Some will be bad dancers, some will be bad gift givers and some will fall flat on birthday celebrations.

There's lines from that book, written by a women, that feel just as true and relevant today, and that's depressing because you think in over 160 years, things would have shifted enough that American women would have found something else to complain about but no, it's still mostly men.\n\nY'all aren't doing enough to pull each other up on your BS, and it's hurting everyone. If the Good Men would be calling out their buddies misogyny, supporting each other and helping each other find healthy ways of moving forward in a way that doesn't require the subjugation of women, maybe we'd all be working together to oust the Bad Men who are ruining it for the rest of you, but I don't see that happening as much as I see the bad men just dragging everyone down with them. Accountability, responsibility, kindness and compassion are hard and that's why they're the mark of a REAL man, because it IS harder to be a good person and stick to that in the face of immorality than it is to be a selfish, unrepentant asshole.\n\nThe 4B Movement in Korea is happening because women are sick and tired and fed up with men's ridiculous bullshit. And don't even start your whataboutism, because it's not like we've ever had any period of history when men have been treated by women the way women have been treated by men. We're learning more, earning more, doing more now than we've ever been allowed to before and guess what?\n\n*It's not that hard. *\n\nMen have run out of excuses and reasons for their incompetence and compete disregard of others. Rather than being better, growing through it and learning how to change themselves or the systems around them for the better, they'd rather just get mad, blame everything on women and strip away our rights until we're back to being chattel. That's the end goal, that's the logical conclusion of what's happening right now, full blown Gilead. It's being made into reality, into law one day at a time, and it's impossible not to see unless you're wilfully blind and I'm ANGRY about it.\n\nBitter feminist rant over. Someone call reddit cares on me, quick, before I explode from my impotent rage. Or just send me death threats and dick pics, it's been a while and I need the entertainment to distract me from the hell I'm trapped in on this planet with these *people.*", "Yeah, birthday person gets to choose the cake.", "The least expensive Kindle is $50, and she said the comedy show tickets were $30 each. I suppose there are bakeries where a cake could cost more than $80, but I don\u2019t think we can say definitively that the cake she did want would have been more expensive than the half assed gifts she didn\u2019t want.", "\"Hey, {my managers name}, I know you said several times that you wanted me to do {X} on the project. I didn't do it, because I didn't realize it was important to you. In the future, you need to communicate that you will feel upset and disappointed in me when I don't do the things that you have repeatedly told me to do. Maybe if you had done that, then I would have done {X}. Yes, I could have asked you if it was really important to you or if you were just talking to talk, but I don't see why that is my responsibility\"\n\nNow see how silly that sounds? Why should a woman expect more consistency and initiative from her employee then from a man who ostensibly loves her?", "Absolutely not. \n\nIf your partner outright says the sentence \u201cThis is what I would like you to get me for my birthday\u201d and you respond with \u201cOkay,\u201d then you get your partner the thing for their birthday. You can add to it if you have other really good ideas, but in general if the thing they ask for isn\u2019t unreasonable and you made it sound like you were willing to get it, not getting it is AH behavior. \n\nOP is allowed to want a partner who takes her seriously and wants to make her happy. That\u2019s apparently not this guy, and OP is NTA.", ">But YOU have a responsibility to tell someone that you have an underlying issue where you will be hurt and disappointed if you ask for something and don't and don't get it when it's your special day. \n\nLmao no she doesn't. Because everyone who has basic empathy and social skills knows a person would be disappointed when they didn't get something that was super simple to get and they communicated about it plenty of times. Stop babying useless cheap men.\n\nYou're putting the responsibility of ''talking it out'' on her instead of him. There's nothing to talk about.", "This isn't like he brought home the wrong kind of bread from a grocery run; this was the *one special thing* she had been talking about wanting for _weeks_! That she specifically texted him a reminder for to make sure he remembered that she wanted it! How could she have been *more* clear that this was important to her? \n\nHow can you agree that it's not about the cake, and then say that this is her fault because she didn't explicitly tell him that she would be sad if he didn't get the cake she asked for? Why is it assholish for her to be upset about his blatant lack of attention or interest in her wants?", "Oh, don't get me wrong! I didn't at all mean to sound like I'm making excuses for him. I meant that he didn't care enough to remember.", "hmmm...so close. I didn't say he didn't request payment. Maybe you should read it again.", "...That just sounds like low standards, sorry.\n\nOP didn't ruin her birthday, her boyfriend literally did with his actions.", ">Like, just show me that you care by putting in at least a bit of effort \n\nFor example paying attention to the cake flavor you prefer?\n\n>But, then again, I'm almost 34, so maybe that's because I'm older.  I'm not sure of your age, but you don't sound quite that old yet lol.\n\nI'm also 34, and I would be upset if my fianc\u00e9 ignored the One Thing I asked for on my birthday. It would have taken him less effort to just buy the cake and not the rest of the stuff.", "So any guy that wants to impress a woman like this the answer is don\u2019t!! Ugh! All he had to do was listen and get her the cake which is way less expensive that what he got. Just because it\u2019s more expensive doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s better. At 10 months in I would be questioning it every gift giving event would be like this. Him thinking he \u201cknows better\u201d.", "She said she mentioned it several times after. I took that to mean she didn\u2019t harp on it, like mention it to him every day, but she brought it up during specific instances when appropriate and then *texted him a reminder* about the cake and the bakery the week before.", "But it wasnt the one thing she asked for was it? She asked for gifts, a planned night out and the cake. And she pestered him over and over again. Reminding someone to do something over and over again stresses most people out. And its not like he can get the cake two weeks in advance. At most he could get it the day before, but probably only the day off. So what if on that one day he could get that cake things did not go perfectly well for him? She didn't really give him a chance to explain. Maybe his explanation is that he simply screwed up, maybe it was something out of his control, you have no idea because she threw a tantrum and came to reddit rather than talk to him.", "We're not supposed to make our judgments that way though. We have the OP's story and that's what we're supposed to decide on.\n\nI mean, even if you feel like her repeated reminders were not stated clearly enough, she told us she sent him a reminder text a week before his birthday with the info about the cake and the bakery details. But from what I see:\n\n1. OP stated one month before her birthday she didn't need a gift and just wanted the pineapple upside down cake from that specific bakery.\n2. OP reminded him every time they went by the bakery that she wanted that cake for her birthday.\n3. OP sent a text 1 week before her birthday with the reminder and the specific information.\n\nUnless you want to flat-out accuse her of lying about all that, I'm not seeing your point at all.", "I think it takes it from a request to a request disregarded and thrown carelessly aside. and certainly not a demand.", "A Ron Weasley response. All the emotional depth of a teaspoon.", "I find it absolutely wild that apparently neither you nor anyone you know has gotten the cake they requested (for free) from a friend or family member on your guys\u2019 birthdays. I\u2019m sorry your life is this way and I hope it gets better for you.", "Question tho, do the others actually enjoy your gifts? Or do they just pretend to and you take pride in it? \n\nThe first rule of gift giving is, give something they would enjoy. So if you\u2019re just spending cash on things based what you think they will want when they have explicitly said what they want, you\u2019re not good at gift giving.", "This is an absolutely stupid take. You think she\u2019s an asshole for asking for a type of cake?? Can you please explain to me why that\u2019s a bad thing?", "I wonder why you feel she is wrong for her asking for something trivial but very meaningful to her. I'm thinking how small her wants and desires are. \nThink of all the posts one sees about folk rejecting very expensive gifts because they weren't expensive enough. She asked for very little. And yet that seems too much fuss for you?", "> And he HAD already spent money on a GIFT and an EXPERIENCE.\n\nThat she didn\u2019t ask for or want. She wanted the cake. She explicitly said she didn\u2019t need a gift so if he spent so much on the kindle that he couldn\u2019t afford to buy the one thing she actually wanted, that\u2019s his fault.", "Yeah, but at the same time, Homeboy could just get the cake and avoid everything else like JFC", "If OP hadn't very clearly expressed her desire for a specific thing, then it would obviously be rude to be upset at whatever BF chose to give her. But she did (without 'demanding' anything), so her disappointment/hurt is 100% justified.", "So was his goal in getting a different cake to spite her for asking for the cake she wanted so many times? Because I wouldn\u2019t want to stay in a relationship with someone who decided to punish me for wanting something specific.", "I\u2019m guessing he doesn\u2019t like pineapple cake", "I was thinking the same thing, possibly a free perk/award or something.", "I think a lot of guys like to give tech gadgets as presents. I've definitely received a lot of tech gadgets I didn't really want or ask for from multiple ex bfs", "And he asked her to reimburse him for the ticket which was a gift she never asked for. Throw this whole person in the trash and keep it moving. \n\nThankfully he's shown how little he cares about her needs and wants early on. You've only wasted 10 months op. Don't waste anymore time.", "Yes, and get this loser out of your life!", "My husband is the same. If I can't find something he wants or he doesnt know, I now get him a gc to Dunkin, a Playstation gc, a Nitendo gc, and a Google Play gc", "i hate to make any assumptions bc adhd affects us in lots of ways and can look so different for everyone, but this sounds like a huge bummer and like he's gotten used to doing the bare minimum/expecting you to take care of it. and there are definitely times the bare minimum is all i can muster, but if he's not actively trying to manage his symptoms, that's incredibly shitty for you.", "Yeah. I like to have a gift show care and thought and I might want to show that through surprise. But not the cake.", "You also forgot to add the cake, plus her ticket was 30$ so 2 tickets are 60$, no guarantee kindle is the cheapest but sure why not. That\u2019s 110$ + cake. \nBut heyy if you wanna assume the worst just say the kindle was a regift, the comedy show was something the bf wanted to do and the grocery store cake was a halfhearted attempt to make up for the actual cake he forgot. Why not assume the worst in people, lol", "he also agreed to get the cake in the first place, which was the entire reason she didn\u2019t buy it herself", "Yes, I see how silly it sounds.   She's his lover not his boss.  This poor man probably felt proud of himself for spending a lot of money, getting her the kindle and tickets.    I think people think that way sometimes.  All clueless like \"you wanted something that cost $50, I spent $200, the bigger dollar amount is better\".   Not really right but.. \n\nI mean there's a bunch of comments here acting like - she wanted cake and he pooped in a bucket.", "She provided idea about activities and the specific cake. She wasn't too fussed with anything else gift related BUT this cake in particular. I understand this might sound a lot through text, but in reality, that's like taking someone out to dinner and then buying them a gift to go alongside. Like if someone asked for  a cake, are you going to really tell me you'd think \"damn they want a cake from our local bakery, this is going to be SO hard?\"\n\nFrom the post, this cake doesn't seem like a personalized birthday cake. As a result, all you would need to do is call or visit the bakery, ask when you could pick one up and plan accordingly. \n\nFrom the information we are given, he responded that he didn't think the cake was a big deal. There was no excuse as to why he couldn't buy it, and he wasn't particularly apologetic.\n\nI just think you're giving a lot of excuses for someone that evidently didn't do the one obvious thing that would have made their partner happy. On one hand you say she pestered him and that's stressful... but then she came to reddit rather than communicate with him? well what more could she say to make him understand?\n\nIf irl he dropped by and said \"I'm sorry, I knew how much you wanted that cake but due to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ I couldn't make that happen today, let's get it another time\" and she reacted that way, i'd agree with you, but that's not the case (as far as we know).", "I have severe anxiety and if my partner told me what they wanted several times, I\u2019d probably just order the thing they asked for? Maybe reach out and ask if the bakery does scheduled orders? \n\nI understand that there are a million different ways to have anxiety but the reason I mention the above is because you can\u2019t just say \u201che must have been anxious\u201d and give him an out. \n\nShe asked for a specific cake (the present) and a fun thing to do. It\u2019s really not that much.", "I've literally never asked for a specific cake, nor have i known anyone ever do this, I didn't know that's even a thing. (Preference for what type of cake you like mught be asked) It sounds genuinely odd to demand a specific cake from a specific place and then throw a hissy fit if you don't get it. Sounds like something a spoilt 7 year old might do.\n\nIs this an American thing? As in the UK I've literally never heard of anyone deciding what cake they expect other people to buy them. Cakes from bakeries aren't exactly cheap either, to be demanding.", "It's called standards. When you have an intimate relationship with someone, expecting more than nothing from them is the least you should do if you have any self respect.\n\nYou're not *entitled* to be welcomed into their life. She is not some worthless cretin that should be grateful someone even bothered to give her the time of day. She deserves attention, love, and respect and giving less than that means you don't deserve hers.", "Look, I firmly believe that good gift givers know their friends and family good enough that they can see something and be like, \"oh, Jerry would like that.\"\n\nYou gain that insight by paying attention to their lives, their hobbies and conversations you have with them.\n\nYes, I genuinely believe everything I've ever gotten anyone is helpful, wanted and used in their life.\n\nThe only reason why I'm not siding with OP is because of how ridiculous I feel it is. Their boyfriend made an effort and instead of appreciating it they kicked them out over a lousy cake. They may have a great realtionship besides that cake and I feel like it's immature and shallow to throw such a fit over something like this. \n\nYeah, he actually was wrong. I'd probably have just bought the cake they wanted. Unfortunately I also feel like her response to a lack of a cake is a complete overreaction. If that's all it took then their relationship isn't very good. \n\nBut like I have said countless times before, expecting or demanding something changes the nature of the gift in to something more like an offering.\n\nI don't like it when people make demands like that. I am willing to take them in to consideration, sometimes I get them exactly what they requested, sometimes I don't.\n\nIt's my money and my choice who I buy for and what.\n\nMy best friend and his wife just had their first baby. When she was pregnant she posted a wish list but also said they'd be grateful for anything they get. \n\nThat's how it's supposed to be.\n\nEdit: if folks are going to downvote me for answering a question genuinely then don't bother me with responses. I'm just going to start blocking people, there's no point in having a conversation with people who don't legitimately want to have a conversation.", "Sure hindsight is 20/20, but i would never expect anyone older than 9yo react the way OP did to not getting exactly what they wanted. \n\nIf some was dropping hints/ telling me exactly what they wanted as much as OP did it would 100% turn me off from getting them that. At that point it wouldn't feel like a gift anymore, but rather a hostage demand I was meeting.", "Maybe our definitions of demand are different.\n\nBut if someone says they want x thing and nothing else will do, that is not expressing what you want but rather demanding x thing. No one is entitled to a gift, so no gift is the baseline and getting a gift any gift is going above.", "shame on us for wanting something, asking for it repeatedly, not getting it then being disappointed when it wasn't difficult in the first place!", "Or he didn\u2019t bother to order one and they didn\u2019t have any that say so he had to do the grocery store ready made.", "Yeah I\u2019ve honestly seen kindles given away so many times in recent years and I\u2019ve never met someone who actually bought one.", "one year at christmas i bought a roomba, not as a gift for my wife but i wrapped it super elaborate and put her name on it to open it...she was like \"what the fuck is this?\"...i got her a decent gift, but she really thought i was giving her a robot vacuum cleaner like \"i thought of you when i saw this\" and i had to do a lot of clarification, but i saw some videos of people taping bumbo seats to roombas and riding their kids on them and i really wanted one since we like just had a baby and stuff too and i wanted to be a roomba racing dad", "Thanks! I forgot to do the math on that! It\u2019s silly to assume one cake would be more expensive than all the gifts she didn\u2019t want.", "She mentioned it so many times. Any partner who actually cared would pay attention. She specifically said that cake was all she wanted. He\u2019s an idiot if he didn\u2019t know it was a big deal to her. I mentioned a concert offhandedly one time to my now husband when we first started dating and he bought me tickets for Valentine\u2019s Day. Classic case of if he wanted to, he would.", "> sometimes people just don't realize that there is a bigger attachment to something.\n\nThat tracks if he had a lobotomy recently.", "Still didn\u2019t read\u2026", "Im shocked that \u201cwhat kind of cake do you want for your birthday\u201d isn\u2019t a standard question over there. It is here. Guess caring about other people having a good time on their birthdays is an American thing, sorry about your country with all its miserable and bitter people. I hope it gets better for you.", "Wow you sound entitled. A lack of a pineapple cake is not a lack of love and respect. What a childish take.", "As a man who has done the last minute thing many times (because I struggle with deadlines and remembering stuff), I have had to go the substitute cake more than once. Every time, though, I've apologized straight up, because I should have done better. OP is absolutely NTA.", "That\u2019s me with my collection of Bluetooth speakers.", "Because people don't always know that not getting the specific 1 thing would ruin a 10month long relation ship.", "It\u2019s still a payment for a \u201cbirthday gift\u201d. Therefore still shitty.", "lmao my bad for not getting the details of which \u201cgift\u201d OP was asked to reimburse her boyfriend for\u2026 after working 18hr after 12hr with only a 6hr break in between & becoming generally upset after reading this, the details you\u2019re pissy about become interchangeable\u2026 it\u2019s just how the human body works once exhaustion is reached", "\"What kind of cake \" is absolutely a standard question. \"Buy this specific cake or you've ruined my birthday and I hate you\" isn't normally the response, but then again Americans do tend to be spoilt, self obsessed drama queens so it's not that surprising.", "Not all Americans are this dramatic for anyone reading .", "Oh my fucking God. A woman repeats herself multiple times, clearly saying what she wants, when and where she wants it from and gives a man clear directions on how to get it. Yet it's still her fucking fault because SOMEHOW men will whine she wasn't clear enough.\n\nIs he a grown ass adult capable of common sense and logic or a 3 year old!?!? Because your explanation of how she should talk to him is exactly how I talk to toddlers.", "So his shit reaction to her disappointment plays no role in the \"ruining of a 10 month relationship\" in your opinion?\n\nHe realizes he hurt her and instead of saying \"I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was so important to you. Lets enjoy the night and we will get your cake tomorrow for a double birthday celebration\"\n\nOr \" I'm sorry, I tried to get the cake but they were sold out for today. I didn't realize that I needed to preorder that cake. I have an order in for tomorrow\"\n\n\nInstead he was dismissive and told her she was being a brat because it's just a cake and what she wants doesn't matter.", "You're trying to defend the guy here but you make him sound like a complete and total idiot. Which is fair I guess.\n\nSometimes it feels like we have higher standards for how little kids behave than grown ass men.", "Ah the good old ''well you're not legally obliged to do anything for anyone''.", "Its how emotional I think - Its so funny - all I keep thinking about this the silly shower head lol \n\nMy friend N is like this, you better get her the exact thing she said she wanted, anything else is going ruin her day, and the rest of the our day together is emotional terrorism, \"you don't love meeeeeeee\".  So shopping for her is like doing instatcart - no joy, just business.   \n\nMy friend other T just had her 52nd b-day in Feb.  She said she wanted this specific lotion and hand soap from Bath and Body.   I bought her a shower head with a long hose attachment because I thought she'd like it.     When we got to the restaurant that night she told everyone I'm the best gift giver (3 years running now, 49, 50 and 51).  2 days later I received a sappy emotional email thanking me for my friendship, of always trying to go above and beyond and being thoughtful.      \n\nSo yeah, Idk", "She didn't say he had a shit reaction, she said she had the shit reaction and told him to go home.   All he did was complain that the tickets should go to waste over a cake.    We was trying to work through it and she kicked him out. \n\nShe never said he said what she wants doesn't matter. She never said he called her a brat.", "Okay, but those are two different scenarios here. Your friend N is nuts, maybe OP is too, but that's yet to be seen. You obviously know your friend T very well and put thought and effort into finding a gift that she would appreciate. OP's boyfriend didn't put any thought or effort into it. He bought her a kindle (which she showed no interest in), a cake (but not the specific one she asked for, seriously, how much harder would that have been), and tickets to a comedy show which she \"thinks\" she might've enjoyed, but she's never been to one and wasn't on her list of recommendations she made to him for her birthday. He put exactly 0 thought and effort into the gift, he didn't try to find a gift she could enjoy, something she may not have even known she wanted. He did the bare minimum, and her emotion is understandable in that scenario. Now, if there's more to the story and she matches your friend N, I'll change my tune in a heartbeat."]}
