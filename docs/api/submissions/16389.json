I put a lot of effort into birthdays (including his) and was pretty excited about it for the last month or so. There is a local bakery that makes a really good-looking pineapple upside down cake. I have been really wanting to try it and have been saving it for my birthday. About a month in advance, I told him my birthday was coming up and gave him a few activity ideas, and told him that I didn't need a gift but I really wanted a pineapple upside down cake from XYZ Bakery, he said \"sure.\"\n\nNow...I know this was probably annoying, but I did mention this specific cake several times, even before last month. Like we would drive by the bakery and I'd say something like \"Oh hey that's the place with the pineapple cake, I wanna do that for my birthday.\" I wasn't deliberately hammering the point home or anything (or aware that it was gonna end in a cake-centered conflict), but there were a couple occasions where it came up. And then a week before my birthday I did text him a reminder about the cake so that he would have the bakery info on hand.\n\nYesterday rolls around and my boyfriend comes over to my apartment and gives me a gift, which is a Kindle. Not a bad gift and I know they are expensive, but not something particularly relevant to me either. Then he says let's have cake, and presents what you all know by now is *not* the pineapple upside down cake, but just a regular grocery store cake with the frosting balloons. Vanilla cake with vanilla buttercream. You guys, I was legitimately sad. If I knew he was gonna drop the ball on this, I would have just gotten myself a pineapple cake months ago instead of waiting. I was on the verge of tears because of not getting the one thing I actually wanted which was that stupid cake, so I told him I was very disappointed and that he should just go home. He had two tickets to a comedy show for that night and one ended up going to waste. Now he's annoyed because it is of course \"just a cake\" and wants me to reimburse the cost of the wasted ticket. It was only about $30, but I'm bristling at the principal of it and said I didn't owe him the money.

You didn't hint. You flat out told him what you wanted, and he ignored it. Not saying leave him, but that screams minimal effort. Talk to him about it, and he can eat that $30", "NTA- I'm sick of boyfriends/husbands getting a pass on BS like this. You clearly told him what you wanted and then he didn't even get the cake! You asked for one thing and he couldn't even do that right.", "NTA. You asked for 1 thing, and not getting it is understandably disappointing. Your reaction is understandable. He just straight up ignored what you requested, it would be different (not necessarily better), if he waited too long and the bakery couldn't get the cake on time, but he planned to get you a kindle (a gift which you apparently neither need nor want). He didn't forget, he went directly against your stated desires intentionally. Don't pay him back, he's the one that put the ticket to waste with his actions, not you.", "NTA You specifically told him you wanted the cake from that bakery. Did you need to tattoo it on his hand so he'd remember? I am not sure if he needs better listening skills or if he is disrespectful, but if y'all want to stay together, he needs to take a much more ACTIVE role in your conversations. \n\nJust as an example, back when my son was 15, he didn't have a job or a lot of money, but he was a thoughtful kid. So he asked one of the guys I worked with if he could make 10 bucks doing something to help him out, my coworker was willing to give the kid 10 bucks, so they did the task and my son got paid. A few weeks later, on Mother's Day, he surprised me with my favorite chocolates and a card. That was why he wanted to earn the money. I had only told him one time what my favorite chocolate was, (single mom, suoer tight budget) and had not had any in quite a while. I know for a fact that he treats his girfriend the same way. That is how a boyfriend/partner should act when it comes to things that you mention, several times.  (Honestly, it seems like the boys who have bern raised by single mothers are a lot more intuitive and empathetic than ones who grow up in the good old \"nuclear family\" environment. That is simply my personal observation, there are probably plenty of examples of horrible people raised by a single mom.)\n\nI am really sorry you were so disappointed on your birthday, but, now you don't need an excuse, go buy that cake and share with NOBODY! ...well, unless you want to of course. You can totally have a \"Very Merry Unbirthday\" all by yourself.", "NTA. Why are you dating a guy who doesn\u2019t listen to you? Does he make you happy in other ways?

He\u2019s definitely not listening to what you\u2019re saying or understanding what\u2019s important to you and what\u2019s not. Seems menial but turns into big things down the line usually. And him asking for the cost of the ticket that was meant as a gift is a bit much too in my opinion. I\u2019d send him a text and literally spell Thai all out for him and why you were so emotional over it all. \n\nHappy belated Birthday!!", "NTA - you specifically asked for this one thing and he didn\u2019t deliver. \n\nIMO Birthday gifts aren\u2019t as much about the item as they are a demonstration of your listening and \u201cseeing\u201d that person.", "NTA\n\nForget all the cake stuff, the AH opportunity was the comedy show in question. Presumably, this was also a gift to you as it was an event for your birthday. If you don't want to go cause he messed up your cake, or because you're not in a funny mood, or because you'd rather do something else you can. In my view, when someone gifts tickets to an event, the gift is the *choice* to go for free, not the obligation to attend. \n\nUnless his middle name is ticketmaster, I wouldn't expect to be hit with an erroneous \"I-feel-disappointed-on-my-not-birthday\" fee on that ticket stub.", "NTA and the bar for men is on the floor. How hard is it to buy a pineapple cake?", "NTA. You asked for one small thing, and he decided he knew better.", "NTA. You were so specific. You\u2019re allowed to be upset when someone disappoints you. All the people who are saying ESH because you got so upset about a cake don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s not about the cake. It\u2019s about him not listening to you or not caring about making your birthday what you wanted. It\u2019s your birthday. You shouldn\u2019t have to put on a happy face and go to a comedy show to appease the feelings of the person who hurt your feelings. And you definitely shouldn\u2019t have to reimburse him for the tickets when it was his fault you were too upset to go.", "NTA, I know all too well how it feels when you've practically put a neon sign in front of them and they ignore it.  It sucks and I'm sorry.  Him asking for reimbursement is pretty tacky.", "NTA", "No NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to listen to your partner when they make comments like you did.\n\nBesides, the comedy show has nothing to do with the cake. For whatever reason, you did not attend. I assume the comedy show was something he planned to pay for as a birthday activity, so why would you be responsible for that cost whether you went or not?", "INFO:  What did he say when you asked him \"why didn't you get me the pineapple upside down cake\"?", "NTA. You asked for something very inexpensive compared to the gifts he got you, and you made it very clear that you wanted this specific thing. He disregarded everything you said and has the audacity to ask you to reimburse him like you\u2019re a department store.", "NTA. You asked for the bare minimum and instead of getting you what you DIRECTLY TOLD HIM you wanted, he did simething else. That's weird. Was the cake prohibitively expensive or something? Does the bakery ask for a certain timeframe to order the cake for it to be ready and he missed it?", "NTA I'd end it over something like this. He even got himself a present for your bday.", "NTA, but this relationship is probably dead. If he won't listen to you about this, what about bigger issues down the line?", "NTA you made it a point to tell him multiple times im sorry", "Damn, all the unabashed terrible gift givers coming out of the woodwork for this one. NTA", "This isn't about the cake at all.. \n\nThis is about your bf that don't give a shit about what you say... you spend MONTHS telling him in FRONT of the bakery and pointing that you wanted a specific cake and he actually ended buying the wrong cake of a random bakery? Hell no... He had ONE JOB and he failed in it..\n\nThis shows where your importance to him stands in his priorities... he in the end is angry because he spend 30$ and want reimburse? Go tell this MF to fuck himself... WTF .. even i am upset now.", "Info: Did you ask him to buy the tickets?\n\nIf you didn't, YNTA.\n\nHappy birthday, BTW. I hope you have the cake you want.", "NTA\n\nHow hard is it to follow instructions? It is just pure laziness on his behalf.", "NTA. Life\u2019s too short to date someone who thinks they know what you want more than you do.", "NTA. You seem to have very clearly stated what you wanted and he, either because he didn\u2019t care/listen or thinks he knows better, got you something else. It\u2019s not a great indicator for the future of your relationship, tbh.", "NTA\n\nYou gave him specific instructions. He failed them, not through a mistake, but seemingly a lack of interest.", "NTA. You specifically told him the cake you wanted and where to get it, if he felt like he couldn\u2019t do that simple task he should have said something. \n\nI completely understand where you\u2019re coming from. You were craving that cake and super excited about having it for your birthday only to be let down and at this point it\u2019s no longer just about the cake. It\u2019s his lack of effort and care to get you the one thing you asked for. \n\nFor my last birthday I told my husband I wanted a chocolate cake with raspberry filling and chocolate fudge icing from Publix and he got me the cake because he knew what it meant to me and knew it would make me happy.", "NTA at all! But definitely get a new boyfriend.", "NTA. It's kind of about the cake, but mostly it's about him not listening to you after you *explicitly told him several times what you wanted* and then him ignoring you. It's perfectly logical to be disappointed when your partner shows that they don't make as much an effort for you as you do for them (you made him *cannolli*??? gurl toss him in the trash he doesn't deserve you)", "NTA\n\nRegardless of the whole backstory, he shouldn't make you pay for your own birthday cake.  Is he going to Venmo you to pay for the Kindle next?", "NTA. You were clear you wanted pineapple upside down cake (which is better than vanilla, I made one last week).

Why can't they just say what they're thinking? We're not mind readers!\n\nGirls: I'd love a pineapple upside-down cake for my birthday. Literally just the cake would make me so happy.

So he's clearly TAH.\nBut you know he doesn't understand that the reason of your tears is not a cake. If you have a childhood trauma maybe you should consider a therapy. Not because of your boyfriend but because it would make your life much easier.\nAlso you should talk in a calm way and explain your position if you want to stay a couple.", "I get you.\nI get sad on my birthday too when disappointed.\nEspecially when I make myself clear on expectations (nothing major but always something that makes me feel \"seen\").\n\nYour boyfriend is kinda AH because of the reimbursement stuff, I understand his frustrated because from his point of view he did make an effort but he still failed you on a test he didn't realize was a test of listening.\n\nYou should speak with him when cooled down and clear the air.\nWorse send him the 30$ and a goodbye.", "Info: did you ask him why he didn\u2019t get the cake you mentioned repeatedly wanting? And did you ask him the thought process behind the kindle? Give him a chance to explain, if there was reason, why he went off base on these items. The unfortunate reality is while you put a lot of effort into birthdays and gifts as you said, not everyone does. How aware is he of you feeling as though you are repeatedly let down by things? And assuming he knows, how does he respond to this information. There is a possibility that gift giving and birthdays aren\u2019t a big deal to him so he went about your birthday as he would his own. Unfortunately I am assuming he knows the same information you gave us and that is when you need to have a conversation with him about expectations and why he chose to be another in a long line of people to disappoint you.", "Hard to decide between NTA and ESH: it depends on how clear you made it to him. If you actually asked him to buy it and he didn\u2019t, then he\u2019s an asshole. If you hinted at it, or said it was one of the things you would like, then you should just have been clearer. Because as others have said, a pineapple cake isn\u2019t a typical birthday cake so it\u2019s not the first thing you think of. Besides, some people (like me) want to surprise their SO. So something that you\u2019ve already talked about a hundred times is a bit boring to give as a gift.\n\nIm a guy and tbh, whether it was my fault or not, I would be really pissed if I went through all this effort and my gf would be this angry. If it\u2019s just a 10 month relationship I would break up with her on the spot.", "I may get dragged for this, but I kind of feel like this is an ESH.  He sucks because he should have gotten you the cake you wanted, and he was an idiot that he didn't.  But, it does come across as poor taste to make this big of a fuss about this.  You basically ruined your own birthday over cake.  I don't fault you for being disappointed, but I just don't think that this was handled very maturely.", "ESH, I say this with love because I understand the feeling. It\u2019s hard not to get disappointed on your birthday (especially when my love language is gift giving) but I think you handled it poorly. For reasons obvious to us all I think he sucks for being so uncaring and thoughtless, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to kick someone out of your house and cancel plans over receiving the wrong cake. You still received a kindle and a cake, they may not be the perfect gifts for you but they are still things you should show appreciation for. You should have been gracious then had a chat later on about it. \n\nAs advice for the future: never expect anyone else to do something special for your birthday. Saves a lot of heartache, and makes for the most meaningful moments. Everything that does happen is a pleasant surprise, and everything that doesn\u2019t, do it for yourself!", "INFO: Did you say \"I want this cake for my birthday?\" or did you just keep mentioning how much you like upside down pineapple cake from that bakery? To some people the only \"birthday cake\" is the traditional.....well.....birthday cake.", "DUMP HIM!!

It sounds like you didn't give him the chance to \\*make it right\\* and he was still very thoughtful and generous.\n\nI am sorry, but Y.T.A. You should have given him a chance rather than tell him you were disappointed and to go home. If you allowed him to comfort you at least, maybe you could have made yourself feel better and go to the comedy show with him.\n\nEdited: Oops, my reply was so long I forgot about the him charging you for the ticket. I don't think he should be doing that so I guess I will change to ESH. \n\nDon't pay him back btw, that was a gift, but also realize that no matter how much \\*hinting\\* (or flat out telling him) you do, no one is actually obligated to get you the specific thing you want.

I'd much rather forgo gift giving entirely for big occasions. If someone gets me some perfect gift, while it is great, it also adds stress and pressure on me to do the same. It is it entirely possible that after all of the effort you put in for his birthday, coupled with all of the hints, pressure and suggestions led to making him anxious and screwing up the cake thing because he was worried about so many other things around your birthday?  \nMaybe there was something going on in your bfs life that he didn't have time to run to this specific bakery, maybe the bakery hours conflicted with his work, maybe it ran out of that cake? \n\nIf you only do nice things for other people with the expectation that they will do nice things for you in kind you will always be disappointed.\n\nNot every person you date will be great at everything in a relationship. Some will be bad dancers, some will be bad gift givers and some will fall flat on birthday celebrations.

There's lines from that book, written by a women, that feel just as true and relevant today, and that's depressing because you think in over 160 years, things would have shifted enough that American women would have found something else to complain about but no, it's still mostly men.\n\nY'all aren't doing enough to pull each other up on your BS, and it's hurting everyone. If the Good Men would be calling out their buddies misogyny, supporting each other and helping each other find healthy ways of moving forward in a way that doesn't require the subjugation of women, maybe we'd all be working together to oust the Bad Men who are ruining it for the rest of you, but I don't see that happening as much as I see the bad men just dragging everyone down with them. Accountability, responsibility, kindness and compassion are hard and that's why they're the mark of a REAL man, because it IS harder to be a good person and stick to that in the face of immorality than it is to be a selfish, unrepentant asshole.\n\nThe 4B Movement in Korea is happening because women are sick and tired and fed up with men's ridiculous bullshit. And don't even start your whataboutism, because it's not like we've ever had any period of history when men have been treated by women the way women have been treated by men. We're learning more, earning more, doing more now than we've ever been allowed to before and guess what?\n\n*It's not that hard. *\n\nMen have run out of excuses and reasons for their incompetence and compete disregard of others. Rather than being better, growing through it and learning how to change themselves or the systems around them for the better, they'd rather just get mad, blame everything on women and strip away our rights until we're back to being chattel. That's the end goal, that's the logical conclusion of what's happening right now, full blown Gilead. It's being made into reality, into law one day at a time, and it's impossible not to see unless you're wilfully blind and I'm ANGRY about it.\n\nBitter feminist rant over.

I suppose there are bakeries where a cake could cost more than $80, but I don\u2019t think we can say definitively that the cake she did want would have been more expensive than the half assed gifts she didn\u2019t want.", "\"Hey, {my managers name}, I know you said several times that you wanted me to do {X} on the project. I didn't do it, because I didn't realize it was important to you. In the future, you need to communicate that you will feel upset and disappointed in me when I don't do the things that you have repeatedly told me to do. Maybe if you had done that, then I would have done {X}. Yes, I could have asked you if it was really important to you or if you were just talking to talk, but I don't see why that is my responsibility\"\n\nNow see how silly that sounds? Why should a woman expect more consistency and initiative from her employee then from a man who ostensibly loves her?", "Absolutely not. \n\nIf your partner outright says the sentence \u201cThis is what I would like you to get me for my birthday\u201d and you respond with \u201cOkay,\u201d then you get your partner the thing for their birthday. You can add to it if you have other really good ideas, but in general if the thing they ask for isn\u2019t unreasonable and you made it sound like you were willing to get it, not getting it is AH behavior. \n\nOP is allowed to want a partner who takes her seriously and wants to make her happy.

Because everyone who has basic empathy and social skills knows a person would be disappointed when they didn't get something that was super simple to get and they communicated about it plenty of times.

That she specifically texted him a reminder for to make sure he remembered that she wanted it! How could she have been *more* clear that this was important to her? \n\nHow can you agree that it's not about the cake, and then say that this is her fault because she didn't explicitly tell him that she would be sad if he didn't get the cake she asked for? Why is it assholish for her to be upset about his blatant lack of attention or interest in her wants?", "Oh, don't get me wrong! I didn't at all mean to sound like I'm making excuses for him. I meant that he didn't care enough to remember.", "hmmm...so close. I didn't say he didn't request payment.

She asked for gifts, a planned night out and the cake. And she pestered him over and over again. Reminding someone to do something over and over again stresses most people out. And its not like he can get the cake two weeks in advance. At most he could get it the day before, but probably only the day off. So what if on that one day he could get that cake things did not go perfectly well for him? She didn't really give him a chance to explain.

OP reminded him every time they went by the bakery that she wanted that cake for her birthday.\n3.

I\u2019m sorry your life is this way and I hope it gets better for you.", "Question tho, do the others actually enjoy your gifts? Or do they just pretend to and you take pride in it? \n\nThe first rule of gift giving is, give something they would enjoy. So if you\u2019re just spending cash on things based what you think they will want when they have explicitly said what they want, you\u2019re not good at gift giving.", "This is an absolutely stupid take. You think she\u2019s an asshole for asking for a type of cake?? Can you please explain to me why that\u2019s a bad thing?", "I wonder why you feel she is wrong for her asking for something trivial but very meaningful to her. I'm thinking how small her wants and desires are. \nThink of all the posts one sees about folk rejecting very expensive gifts because they weren't expensive enough. She asked for very little. And yet that seems too much fuss for you?", "> And he HAD already spent money on a GIFT and an EXPERIENCE.\n\nThat she didn\u2019t ask for or want. She wanted the cake.

But she did (without 'demanding' anything), so her disappointment/hurt is 100% justified.", "So was his goal in getting a different cake to spite her for asking for the cake she wanted so many times?

I like to have a gift show care and thought and I might want to show that through surprise. But not the cake.", "You also forgot to add the cake, plus her ticket was 30$ so 2 tickets are 60$, no guarantee kindle is the cheapest but sure why not.

Why not assume the worst in people, lol", "he also agreed to get the cake in the first place, which was the entire reason she didn\u2019t buy it herself", "Yes, I see how silly it sounds.   She's his lover not his boss.  This poor man probably felt proud of himself for spending a lot of money, getting her the kindle and tickets.    I think people think that way sometimes.  All clueless like \"you wanted something that cost $50, I spent $200, the bigger dollar amount is better\".   Not really right but.. \n\nI mean there's a bunch of comments here acting like - she wanted cake and he pooped in a bucket.", "She provided idea about activities and the specific cake. She wasn't too fussed with anything else gift related BUT this cake in particular. I understand this might sound a lot through text, but in reality, that's like taking someone out to dinner and then buying them a gift to go alongside. Like if someone asked for  a cake, are you going to really tell me you'd think \"damn they want a cake from our local bakery, this is going to be SO hard?\"\n\nFrom the post, this cake doesn't seem like a personalized birthday cake. As a result, all you would need to do is call or visit the bakery, ask when you could pick one up and plan accordingly. \n\nFrom the information we are given, he responded that he didn't think the cake was a big deal. There was no excuse as to why he couldn't buy it, and he wasn't particularly apologetic.\n\nI just think you're giving a lot of excuses for someone that evidently didn't do the one obvious thing that would have made their partner happy. On one hand you say she pestered him and that's stressful... but then she came to reddit rather than communicate with him? well what more could she say to make him understand?\n\nIf irl he dropped by and said \"I'm sorry, I knew how much you wanted that cake but due to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ I couldn't make that happen today, let's get it another time\" and she reacted that way, i'd agree with you, but that's not the case (as far as we know).", "I have severe anxiety and if my partner told me what they wanted several times, I\u2019d probably just order the thing they asked for? Maybe reach out and ask if the bakery does scheduled orders? \n\nI understand that there are a million different ways to have anxiety but the reason I mention the above is because you can\u2019t just say \u201che must have been anxious\u201d and give him an out. \n\nShe asked for a specific cake (the present) and a fun thing to do. It\u2019s really not that much.", "I've literally never asked for a specific cake, nor have i known anyone ever do this, I didn't know that's even a thing. (Preference for what type of cake you like mught be asked) It sounds genuinely odd to demand a specific cake from a specific place and then throw a hissy fit if you don't get it. Sounds like something a spoilt 7 year old might do.\n\nIs this an American thing? As in the UK I've literally never heard of anyone deciding what cake they expect other people to buy them. Cakes from bakeries aren't exactly cheap either, to be demanding.", "It's called standards. When you have an intimate relationship with someone, expecting more than nothing from them is the least you should do if you have any self respect.\n\nYou're not *entitled* to be welcomed into their life. She is not some worthless cretin that should be grateful someone even bothered to give her the time of day. She deserves attention, love, and respect and giving less than that means you don't deserve hers.", "Look, I firmly believe that good gift givers know their friends and family good enough that they can see something and be like, \"oh, Jerry would like that.\"\n\nYou gain that insight by paying attention to their lives, their hobbies and conversations you have with them.\n\nYes, I genuinely believe everything I've ever gotten anyone is helpful, wanted and used in their life.\n\nThe only reason why I'm not siding with OP is because of how ridiculous I feel it is. Their boyfriend made an effort and instead of appreciating it they kicked them out over a lousy cake. They may have a great realtionship besides that cake and I feel like it's immature and shallow to throw such a fit over something like this. \n\nYeah, he actually was wrong. I'd probably have just bought the cake they wanted. Unfortunately I also feel like her response to a lack of a cake is a complete overreaction. If that's all it took then their relationship isn't very good. \n\nBut like I have said countless times before, expecting or demanding something changes the nature of the gift in to something more like an offering.\n\nI don't like it when people make demands like that. I am willing to take them in to consideration, sometimes I get them exactly what they requested, sometimes I don't.\n\nIt's my money and my choice who I buy for and what.\n\nMy best friend and his wife just had their first baby. When she was pregnant she posted a wish list but also said they'd be grateful for anything they get. \n\nThat's how it's supposed to be.\n\nEdit: if folks are going to downvote me for answering a question genuinely then don't bother me with responses. I'm just going to start blocking people, there's no point in having a conversation with people who don't legitimately want to have a conversation.", "Sure hindsight is 20/20, but i would never expect anyone older than 9yo react the way OP did to not getting exactly what they wanted. \n\nIf some was dropping hints/ telling me exactly what they wanted as much as OP did it would 100% turn me off from getting them that. At that point it wouldn't feel like a gift anymore, but rather a hostage demand I was meeting.", "Maybe our definitions of demand are different.\n\nBut if someone says they want x thing and nothing else will do, that is not expressing what you want but rather demanding x thing. No one is entitled to a gift, so no gift is the baseline and getting a gift any gift is going above.", "shame on us for wanting something, asking for it repeatedly, not getting it then being disappointed when it wasn't difficult in the first place!", "Or he didn\u2019t bother to order one and they didn\u2019t have any that say so he had to do the grocery store ready made.", "Yeah I\u2019ve honestly seen kindles given away so many times in recent years and I\u2019ve never met someone who actually bought one.", "one year at christmas i bought a roomba, not as a gift for my wife but i wrapped it super elaborate and put her name on it to open it...she was like \"what the fuck is this?\"...i got her a decent gifts besides that, but she really thought i was giving her a robot vacuum cleaner like \"i thought of you when i saw this\" and i had to do a lot of clarification, but i saw some videos of people taping bumbo seats to roombas and riding their kids on them and i really wanted one since we like just had a baby and stuff too and i wanted to be a roomba racing dad", "Thanks!

I didn\u2019t ask for this but they knew I was a huge fan of the series. They *remembered* my interests. I don\u2019t care how much the gift was. It was that they thought about *me.*", "Don't forget: \"Why are you always overreacting? You're always to emotional! Are you on your period?\"", "And then they turn around and are like \"oh women are such a mystery! How am I ever supposed to figure out what they want?\" Ridiculous.", "My 18th birthday I asked my boyfriend for a Dairy Queen ice cream cake as my top priority. We spent the day doing a scavenger hunt where I drove (I hate driving and he knew) to do fun activities he loved. We got Dairy Queen but not the ice cream cake, idgaf about blizzards. He got me a ps4 which was fine but I have a switch and I never wanted or needed a different console, I didn't even have a personal tv and I couldn't have it in the living room. \n\nI didn't break up with him for another 3 months but my birthday was a big reason why. It's all good pieces of a generic birthday but he didn't care to listen to what I actually wanted to do. There's girls who break up because he got her gold instead of silver jewelry. \n\nI'm definitely not saying breakup with him but do internalize the fact that he either didn't listen or didn't think you knew best.", "Why are you sick of just boyfriends and husbands getting a pass. \n\nI'm sick of it for girlfriends and wives too.\n\n\nI'm also sick of people using gendered language to describe universal experiences, it's 2023.", "Sounds like you got a one in a million. Everyone else out here is just putting up with sub par and not raising there standards.", "I hope she spends that money she doesn\u2019t owe him on a pineapple cake.", "This is the right answer. \ud83d\ude09", "are you still married? holy shit, does he have any redeeming qualities?\n\nhe KNEW you wanted donuts. he clearly knew he would have to order them. how hard would it have been to order them for you too? (answer: not hard at all). this looks like he was intentionally ignoring your feelings. he just assumed you'd order them, but he ordered them for his mom? he clearly knows how gifts work, there's no excuse that makes any part of that ok. \n\nand he made you get up with the baby? that's the bare minimum that he should have done. you don't deserve to be treated like that, that's absolutely disgusting. if that's how he treats you on mother's day, i worry for you the other 364 days of the year. i hope he's either gotten better or you're not still together, that's just awful.", "I don't like your husband.", "TO THE STREETS WITH THIS MAN", "Are you my ex?", "One year my husband went out at like 10 pm on Christmas Eve because I put my foot down and said I'd be upset if there was nothing for me that I hadn't bought. He's getting slightly better, but good grief. These days happen every year! Why is it a surprise? I didn't write Mother's Day on the calendar this month. I want to see what's going to happen. (I've been a mom for well over a decade.) I know the teenager will have no clue.", "That doesn't always work. A friend's husband would always get a different version of whatever she said she wanted because, in his mind, the one he bought was \"better\" than the one she asked for. She would get so frustrated. She finally resorted to giving him a printout of the specific item, circle/highlight it, and tell him repeatedly she wanted that specific item exactly, and not a \"better\" or different version. \n\nIt worked,  but really took the joy out of receiving gifts from him.\n\nShe, on the other hand, once borrowed a bunch of xmas trees from friends and created a forest in her living room because her husband missed camping, and they wouldn't be able to get away any time soon. They slept in sleeping bags and cooked dinner in the fireplace. Very romantic!", "It\u2019s easy to know what to gift people. You pay attention. Especially if you live in the same house\u2014for fuck sake. You know what they like, what they don\u2019t like, stuff they\u2019re interested in or like to do. Engage your brain, guys.", "IMO having you try something new is a weird gift idea. Surely he knows things you \\*would\\* like to do. Not \\*maybe\\* would like to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou would know best, but it sounds like he bought something he would like and you would be 'okay' with.", "yeah, it's intentional. he was told exactly what she wanted, and decided that she could order them herself, but he ordered them for someone else? i don't buy it for a second. if he just somehow forgot, and he is genuinely that bad at keeping track of things, then he wouldn't be able to hold down a *job*.", "This is so wholesome. Thank you for sharing.", "I have a bag in my laundry room. Every time I see something that makes me think of my partner, I snag it and put in the bag. Then give said bag on gift giving holidays and start a new one.", "He was going to buy her a Joni Mitchell CD but someone gave him a free Kindle so he went with that instead.", "i bet *he* likes carrot cake a lot more than you do. i'm sorry. you deserve a husband who cares about your feelings. if he did, he'd be trying to fix his behavior here instead of ignoring you. even if he's great in other ways, it's completely reasonable to be upset about something like that! it's inexcusable to not give a shit about your partner's birthday, to not even set reminders to do something? it just sends a message that he doesn't care, and if he doesn't want to fix that, he's an asshole.", "That\u2019s exactly what I was about to say, all these women agreeing and saying theirs is like that too but then Reader, I married him. Like wtf?", "One year I received a black and decker workmate. I didn\u2019t do DIY at the time and didn\u2019t even own a saw or hammer. There was a small sample bottle of a perfume I\u2019d never heard of duct taped to the top. Yet I was programmed (toxic family) to think this was ok and \u201chow men were\u201d and to be grateful I got anything.", "that's horrible, i'm sorry. you deserve a husband who cares about your feelings. if he did, he'd be trying to fix his behavior here instead of ignoring you. even if he's great in other ways, it's completely reasonable to be upset about something like that! it's inexcusable to not give a shit about your partner's birthday, to not even set reminders to do something? it just sends a message that he doesn't care, and if he doesn't want to fix that, he's an asshole. plus, you've already told him all this, so he knows exactly what the problem is, and he just doesn't care enough about your feelings to change that.", "Seriously I love my husband but he just does not seem to be able to figure out what to get me ever. And so he panic buys me jewelry which is lovely but I have so many interests and crafts I love. 5 seconds in a craft store or yarn shop and he'd be golden but I get useless bauballs.  But I don't mention it cause I'd be seen as ungrateful. \n\nI have taken to telling him what to get me and even ordering it for myself and making him pay. That still more work than I should be doing but at least I don't end up with another pair of earrings I'll wear twice a year.", "The first year is honeymoon territory still in every good relationship I've been in. If you're already in the long term relationship and taking it for granted stage there is no way it lasts. If someone is complacent the first year they aren't likely to be magically obsessed with you like you them as the shine wears off more.\n\nMost good partners keep this stuff up forever even when it isn't shiny new as that's what it takes."]}
