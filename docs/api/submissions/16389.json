I put a lot of effort into birthdays (including his) and was pretty excited about it for the last month or so. There is a local bakery that makes a really good-looking pineapple upside down cake. I have been really wanting to try it and have been saving it for my birthday. About a month in advance, I told him my birthday was coming up and gave him a few activity ideas, and told him that I didn't need a gift but I really wanted a pineapple upside down cake from XYZ Bakery, he said \"sure.\"\n\nNow...I know this was probably annoying, but I did mention this specific cake several times, even before last month. Like we would drive by the bakery and I'd say something like \"Oh hey that's the place with the pineapple cake, I wanna do that for my birthday.\" I wasn't deliberately hammering the point home or anything (or aware that it was gonna end in a cake-centered conflict), but there were a couple occasions where it came up. And then a week before my birthday I did text him a reminder about the cake so that he would have the bakery info on hand.\n\nYesterday rolls around and my boyfriend comes over to my apartment and gives me a gift, which is a Kindle. Not a bad gift and I know they are expensive, but not something particularly relevant to me either. Then he says let's have cake, and presents what you all know by now is *not* the pineapple upside down cake, but just a regular grocery store cake with the frosting balloons. Vanilla cake with vanilla buttercream. You guys, I was legitimately sad. If I knew he was gonna drop the ball on this, I would have just gotten myself a pineapple cake months ago instead of waiting. I was on the verge of tears because of not getting the one thing I actually wanted which was that stupid cake, so I told him I was very disappointed and that he should just go home. He had two tickets to a comedy show for that night and one ended up going to waste. Now he's annoyed because it is of course \"just a cake\" and wants me to reimburse the cost of the wasted ticket. It was only about $30, but I'm bristling at the principal of it and said I didn't owe him the money.

You asked for one thing and he couldn't even do that right.", "NTA. You asked for 1 thing, and not getting it is understandably disappointing. Your reaction is understandable. He just straight up ignored what you requested, it would be different (not necessarily better), if he waited too long and the bakery couldn't get the cake on time, but he planned to get you a kindle (a gift which you apparently neither need nor want). He didn't forget, he went directly against your stated desires intentionally. Don't pay him back, he's the one that put the ticket to waste with his actions, not you.", "NTA You specifically told him you wanted the cake from that bakery. Did you need to tattoo it on his hand so he'd remember? I am not sure if he needs better listening skills or if he is disrespectful, but if y'all want to stay together, he needs to take a much more ACTIVE role in your conversations. \n\nJust as an example, back when my son was 15, he didn't have a job or a lot of money, but he was a thoughtful kid. So he asked one of the guys I worked with if he could make 10 bucks doing something to help him out, my coworker was willing to give the kid 10 bucks, so they did the task and my son got paid. A few weeks later, on Mother's Day, he surprised me with my favorite chocolates and a card. That was why he wanted to earn the money. I had only told him one time what my favorite chocolate was, (single mom, suoer tight budget) and had not had any in quite a while. I know for a fact that he treats his girfriend the same way. That is how a boyfriend/partner should act when it comes to things that you mention, several times.  (Honestly, it seems like the boys who have bern raised by single mothers are a lot more intuitive and empathetic than ones who grow up in the good old \"nuclear family\" environment. That is simply my personal observation, there are probably plenty of examples of horrible people raised by a single mom.)\n\nI am really sorry you were so disappointed on your birthday, but, now you don't need an excuse, go buy that cake and share with NOBODY! ...well, unless you want to of course. You can totally have a \"Very Merry Unbirthday\" all by yourself.", "NTA. Why are you dating a guy who doesn\u2019t listen to you? Does he make you happy in other ways?

He\u2019s definitely not listening to what you\u2019re saying or understanding what\u2019s important to you and what\u2019s not. Seems menial but turns into big things down the line usually.

Presumably, this was also a gift to you as it was an event for your birthday. If you don't want to go cause he messed up your cake, or because you're not in a funny mood, or because you'd rather do something else you can. In my view, when someone gifts tickets to an event, the gift is the *choice* to go for free, not the obligation to attend. \n\nUnless his middle name is ticketmaster, I wouldn't expect to be hit with an erroneous \"I-feel-disappointed-on-my-not-birthday\" fee on that ticket stub.", "NTA and the bar for men is on the floor.

It\u2019s about him not listening to you or not caring about making your birthday what you wanted. It\u2019s your birthday. You shouldn\u2019t have to put on a happy face and go to a comedy show to appease the feelings of the person who hurt your feelings.

Him asking for reimbursement is pretty tacky.", "NTA", "No NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to listen to your partner when they make comments like you did.\n\nBesides, the comedy show has nothing to do with the cake.

You asked for the bare minimum and instead of getting you what you DIRECTLY TOLD HIM you wanted, he did simething else. That's weird. Was the cake prohibitively expensive or something?

You were craving that cake and super excited about having it for your birthday only to be let down and at this point it\u2019s no longer just about the cake. It\u2019s his lack of effort and care to get you the one thing you asked for. \n\nFor my last birthday I told my husband I wanted a chocolate cake with raspberry filling and chocolate fudge icing from Publix and he got me the cake because he knew what it meant to me and knew it would make me happy.", "NTA at all! But definitely get a new boyfriend.", "NTA. It's kind of about the cake, but mostly it's about him not listening to you after you *explicitly told him several times what you wanted* and then him ignoring you.

And did you ask him the thought process behind the kindle? Give him a chance to explain, if there was reason, why he went off base on these items. The unfortunate reality is while you put a lot of effort into birthdays and gifts as you said, not everyone does. How aware is he of you feeling as though you are repeatedly let down by things? And assuming he knows, how does he respond to this information. There is a possibility that gift giving and birthdays aren\u2019t a big deal to him so he went about your birthday as he would his own. Unfortunately I am assuming he knows the same information you gave us and that is when you need to have a conversation with him about expectations and why he chose to be another in a long line of people to disappoint you.", "Hard to decide between NTA and ESH: it depends on how clear you made it to him. If you actually asked him to buy it and he didn\u2019t, then he\u2019s an asshole. If you hinted at it, or said it was one of the things you would like, then you should just have been clearer. Because as others have said, a pineapple cake isn\u2019t a typical birthday cake so it\u2019s not the first thing you think of. Besides, some people (like me) want to surprise their SO. So something that you\u2019ve already talked about a hundred times is a bit boring to give as a gift.\n\nIm a guy and tbh, whether it was my fault or not, I would be really pissed if I went through all this effort and my gf would be this angry.

You basically ruined your own birthday over cake.  I don't fault you for being disappointed, but I just don't think that this was handled very maturely.", "ESH, I say this with love because I understand the feeling. It\u2019s hard not to get disappointed on your birthday (especially when my love language is gift giving) but I think you handled it poorly. For reasons obvious to us all I think he sucks for being so uncaring and thoughtless, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to kick someone out of your house and cancel plans over receiving the wrong cake. You still received a kindle and a cake, they may not be the perfect gifts for you but they are still things you should show appreciation for. You should have been gracious then had a chat later on about it. \n\nAs advice for the future: never expect anyone else to do something special for your birthday.

I laughed at the Venmo request because that seems petty. But you reacted badly because you've been mistreated in the past, and not just because he got the wrong cake.

The fact that he is asking for the $30 means it might be for him.\n\nYou also mention that you put a big deal of effort into other people's birthdays. This is only relevant because you seem to expect a tit-for-tat reciprocal deal. Not everyone thinks the same way you do.

I'd much rather forgo gift giving entirely for big occasions. If someone gets me some perfect gift, while it is great, it also adds stress and pressure on me to do the same. It is it entirely possible that after all of the effort you put in for his birthday, coupled with all of the hints, pressure and suggestions led to making him anxious and screwing up the cake thing because he was worried about so many other things around your birthday?  \nMaybe there was something going on in your bfs life that he didn't have time to run to this specific bakery, maybe the bakery hours conflicted with his work, maybe it ran out of that cake? \n\nIf you only do nice things for other people with the expectation that they will do nice things for you in kind you will always be disappointed.\n\nNot every person you date will be great at everything in a relationship. Some will be bad dancers, some will be bad gift givers and some will fall flat on birthday celebrations.

Given how transactional your relationship seems you both might want to think about whether it's worth it.", "That's the point, if your in a relationship you have to tell him that.   If I was the girl that dated him last you have to tell him - I don't care what postbomber would think, your with Fun now AH! \n\nNot everything is obvious to everyone else.  Clearly this guys family didn't raise him to think about this correctly.    If it were your birthday, I'd have gotten you the exact thing you wanted, two of them in fact.   \n\nBut had you not been paying attention to what I wanted, I wouldn't have been hurt.   People are different.   These two aren't bad people.   \n\nUnless he insists on repayment.  Then he's an AH", "You better give me the cake I asked for or else? That's not normal. \n\nI knew someone who did shit like this guy is doing, his reasoning was: \n\n'you asked me for something that cost $50 and I found this $200 thing, how come you don't like it better\" \n\nEffing CLUELESS.   But luckily someone sat him down and explained that the things I said I wanted for you to get me was (a) the thing I really wanted & (b) I wanted you to go through THAT SPECIFIC trouble for me. \n\nThese two can fix this.   I'm rooting for them.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I do think crying is an ungrateful reaction. It's a natural reaction, and I'm a big crier, so I get it. But that doesn't mean that it isn't an ungrateful reaction to a gift! I think kicking him out and cancelling the rest of his gift was the most ungrateful, AH-y part.", "You better give me the only thing I made abundantly clear I wanted for my birthday, the thing I've been literally obsessing over for months, and that I've told you directly about and you implied you would get me. Or else I might get disappointed and emotional.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIDK, seems pretty reasonable.", "His issue is he didn\u2019t pay attention to what she asked for and got her a gift that isn\u2019t indicative of knowing what she likes. She says in another comment that she made certain suggestions for what she\u2019d like to do in her birthday and he didn\u2019t even go with those suggestions. Her issue is she didn\u2019t want to spend the evening with someone who couldn\u2019t bother to get her what she asked for for her birthday. She seems fine to me.", "Jesus, you're acting like she threw a crying tantrum instead of having a very normal reaction to something she had been anticipating for a month. OP doesn't need therapy because her boyfriend couldn't listen and get her the one thing she asked for. Her wanting a specific cake is not a big ask. It's not the same as needing to \"always get what she wants without fail\".", "Then we shall find no common ground here. Have a nice day :)", "[deleted]", "People have emotions. She didn\u2019t scream at him. She didn\u2019t feel capable of continuing the evening. She\u2019s allowed to feel that way. Yes, we don\u2019t always get what we want but there\u2019s nothing wrong with expressing disappointment and separating yourself from the situation. Her reactions and actions are just as legitimate as yours."]}
