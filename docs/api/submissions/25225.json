At the end of the day, a family member\u2019s eccentricity is just an excuse to do whatever they want without repercussions.

We were both super skinny, usually on a diet, and constantly discussing new fangled concepts like interval training and low carb diets. (This was the 90s when not many people did that.)\n\nYou have clearly worked hard to regain your former figure. I wonder if you talk about health, food and exercise a lot.
