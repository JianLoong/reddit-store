I control it around my 2-year old son, but when I\u2019m alone with my husband, I don\u2019t filter myself. He doesn\u2019t like it. He never curses, so he always acts shocked when I swear. (Ie. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking tired right now\u201d... I\u2019m not talking about swearing at him; I\u2019m talking about dropping f-bombs in general. \n\nTonight I asked my husband what time he is coming to bed. He likes to stay up late and play video games on Friday nights and the weekend; whereas I don\u2019t have that option because I have to get up with our son at 7 or 8 am. Before you ask, no, he has never woken up to take care of our son in the morning. Not once. I\u2019m a stay at home mom, and he feels it\u2019s my job to do that. So I haven\u2019t slept longer than my 2.5 year old in 2.5 years. \n\nSo I asked him what time he\u2019s coming to bed, and he said \u201cI dunno, 3am? 4am? 5am?\u201d\n\nAnd without stopping to think about it, I said \u201coh fuck you\u201d...\n\nI meant it as a joke. I knew he was kidding about staying up that late (the latest he stays up is maybe 2:30 am?) I meant it like \u201coh you think you\u2019re so funny, hahaha fuck you, you\u2019re hilarious\u201d. Do you know what I mean? \n\nLike if a friend was complaining to me about getting too many gifts for their kid, I\u2019d jokingly be like \u201coh fuck you, I wish I had your problems\u201d - you know? Sorry that\u2019s the first example that popped into my head. \n\nMy husband took it very seriously. He did not find it funny (just like I didn\u2019t find it funny when he joked that he would stay up until 5 am, but I digress) - and he won\u2019t let it go. I tried to explain it\u2019s something I might say to a friend or family member in certain contexts, and says I\u2019m just rude. \n\nIs he right?

FIRSTLY - SAHM is NOT the same as going to an office for 8 hours a day. It's a 24/7 job, and, as I'm sure you are well aware, as there have been countless articles published on it, if a SAHM was PAID for the actual work they do, they'd be pulling in around 200k/year. So unless he's clearing that and then some, he needs to get his ass out of bed on the weekends AT THE VERY LEAST.\n\nThe fact that he didn't even get up with HIS child for your father's funeral is really heartbreaking to me. Knowing that he wouldn't meet your child's needs if the roles were reversed, in terms of teaching and stimulation, makes his argument \"I'll stay home and you can go back to work\" is entirely moot. \n\n\"FUCK\" is one of my favourite words. I work in a pretty intense job and I hear it at least several times a day from others, directed towards me, in various ways. I know how to interpret it if it's meant to be rude, aggressive, exasperated, in jest, or passionate. \n\nIn turn, I use it a fair bit too. My parents would send me to my room if I said the word ass, or bitch, when I was a teen. Now, as a grown adult, I say what I want and I use \"fuck\" as freely as I want, and sometimes I get told off, and sometimes my mum laughs (usually when I use it in exasperation or jest) and once in a blue moon, SHE will give it back. \n\nI fully understand why you may use it more at this stage in your relationship/life, in terms of stepping on a lego or Hot Wheels, or finding your kid drew all over the wall, or just being completely fucking exhausted... but you're still the same person he chose to date, marry, and have a child with.\n\nIn the words of my old college prof... he needs to \"give his head a shake\". \n\nFirstly, time to put your foot down and make him participate in childcare... of his own child. Secondly, if he really thinks you saying \"Fuck you\" in jest is worth making a big deal over, then he needs to GROW THE FUCK UP and get over himself.", "NTA.

He should at least take one day per week where he wakes up with the kiddo instead of you, so that you can have a break.", "ESH.\n\nHe was upset by it so you should just apologize for upsetting him and leave it at that. Sometimes teasing someone goes too far, even if it's the same way you've teased them for years, and it just hits them wrong. In that case you apologize.\n\nHowever... maybe a little bit of that \"fuck you\" was real? And maybe he deserved that little bit of a \"fuck you\"? He needs to at least once a month give you a lie-in weekend. You deserve that extra sleep sometime, and he should be familiar with your kid's morning routine.

It doesn't make you a bad person. If you swear around others outside of your family though - he might have some built up resentment to that.

Why? Because going there is a completely ineffective way to win your battle because it immediately causes others to become defensive and never listen to your position.\n\nSaying FU to your spouse is vulgar, disrespectful, and a verbal attack on one you profess to love. It does not move any conversation or disagreement toward understanding and is merely akin to slamming a door in someone's face. It accomplishes nothing productive.\n\nEven trying to say it in jest when you already knew he did not like the swearing directed at other things was a verbal attack.

I control it around my 2-year old son, but when I\u2019m alone with my husband, I don\u2019t filter myself. He doesn\u2019t like it. He never curses, so he always acts shocked when I swear. (Ie. \u201cI\u2019m so fucking tired right now\u201d... I\u2019m not talking about swearing at him; I\u2019m talking about dropping f-bombs in general. \n\nTonight I asked my husband what time he is coming to bed. He likes to stay up late and play video games on Friday nights and the weekend; whereas I don\u2019t have that option because I have to get up with our son at 7 or 8 am. Before you ask, no, he has never woken up to take care of our son in the morning. Not once. I\u2019m a stay at home mom, and he feels it\u2019s my job to do that. So I haven\u2019t slept longer than my 2.5 year old in 2.5 years. \n\nSo I asked him what time he\u2019s coming to bed, and he said \u201cI dunno, 3am? 4am? 5am?\u201d\n\nAnd without stopping to think about it, I said \u201coh fuck you\u201d...\n\nI meant it as a joke. I knew he was kidding about staying up that late (the latest he stays up is maybe 2:30 am?) I meant it like \u201coh you think you\u2019re so funny, hahaha fuck you, you\u2019re hilarious\u201d. Do you know what I mean? \n\nLike if a friend was complaining to me about getting too many gifts for their kid, I\u2019d jokingly be like \u201coh fuck you, I wish I had your problems\u201d - you know? Sorry that\u2019s the first example that popped into my head. \n\nMy husband took it very seriously. He did not find it funny (just like I didn\u2019t find it funny when he joked that he would stay up until 5 am, but I digress) - and he won\u2019t let it go. I tried to explain it\u2019s something I might say to a friend or family member in certain contexts, and says I\u2019m just rude. \n\nIs he right? AITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That\u2019s fair.", "NTA. So he gets evenings and weekends off and you don\u2019t ever get time off. It\u2019s time for mommy to go out of town for the weekend. Your son won\u2019t have fun, that\u2019s for certain, but your husband will stop with the \u201cOK, you go to work\u201d crap. \n\nOut of town can be the hotel two miles over, it doesn\u2019t matter, but it\u2019s his freaking turn to actually be a parent and for you to get some time to yourself.", "Well, it sounds like your husband deserves you saying that for real, so definitely NTA.\n\nTBH I don't get people who vehemently hate curse words but will substitute other words for the same thing. Like saying fudge instead of fuck changes the intent of the word or something.", "I think you two seem a little too different to be married. Plus that whole \"makes you get up with the baby\" thing is really, really dickish. He's a parent. The luxury of personal time isn't really one he gets anymore.", "YTA. You did it deliberately to tick him off. You know he doesn't like it, so you decided to upset him.", "NTA. It\u2019s not that deep. I feel like if he\u2019s a gamer he MUST be exposed to much more vulgar language on the regular. Makes me wonder if he just thinks women should be more demure and polite\u2026like how he thinks it\u2019s \u201cyour job\u201d to be mostly responsible for parenting your son? Maybe that\u2019s a reach. Just a thought. Either way, he needs to let it go.", "NTA,\n\nYou may be a SAHM, but it's not your job to Always be getting up early with your kid.. \n\nYour partner needs to get his head out of his ass and step to the plate of being an Actual parent.. and that is sharing the wealth of all responsibilities of parenting.. \n\nIt has actually being scientifically proven that those who swear Alot are highly intelligent.. \n\nAnd I'm someone who grew up and was in a career were swearing is pretty much standard vocabulary and the term.. f*ck off can have several different meanings depending on context and to who it was said..", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think you are joking.", "Nta", "Honestly OP you did mean it. Your post drips of how onesided this parenting is and how you think he should step up--so it was half joke half truth and you*both* know that.\n\nNTA Because he's an A doing no parenting and you're allowed to be frustrated about it.", "NTA. my bf texted me the same phrase earlier today in response to a joke I made. i knew it meant the joke landed just as I wanted it to", "Seriously, please leave him. Your husband sounds so much like mine. My ex even said he'd be more involved when our son was older and \"more fun\". I made it until my son was 19 months old, basically a single mom for that entire time, and then we split. It's not going to get better. NTA", "NTA.\n\nI curse like a sailor, even to my husband. My husband only curses in anger and has never cursed at me. He uses terms of endearment with me (my love, my beautiful, etc). I don\u2019t use terms of endearment because I\u2019m not used to it. So if any outsider looked at us, I look like a huge asshole to him all the time and he looks like he\u2019s blinded by love.\n\nThis is to say, I\u2019m sorry that your husband doesn\u2019t understand the way you express yourself because I completely get how it can be difficult to \u201cshut off\u201d the potty mouth. That being said, I think you should apologize for having said that to your husband because he took it so badly and you don\u2019t want to actually hurt his feelings but it looks like maybe you did accidentally.\n\nI also agree with others that said your husband needs to step up and stop staying up so late and not getting up in the morning. My husband goes to bed late too but after I nurse the baby in the morning, I give him to my husband so I can get some shut eye. This reminds my husband that when he goes to bed late, he\u2019s making himself suffer.", "NTA because of the situation. Sounds like he isn't really involved on the parenting front? Regarding the cussing though, maybe if it peeves him that much, you _could_ try substituting it with something like fudge, at the very least so he doesn't get to hold it against you and you can move on to discussing things that actually matter, like how it's weird that he apparently _never_ wakes up early to spend time with his kid.", "That is an incredible rude thing to say even if he didn't mind swearing. Swearing around someone is one thing; you swore AT him and said what is generally considered the most contemptuous statement in the English language.\n\nYour husband isn't pulling his weight with childcare, that is a separate issue for which he is 1000000 % TA. But in this micro interaction, YTA", "It\u2019s the fact you let his behavior slide when it comes to taking care of his son. It sounds very traditional and sexist to imply it\u2019s a woman\u2019s job to do it. That\u2019s what really bothers me because I wouldn\u2019t let a man I created a baby with say that to me. It sounds like fighting words to me.", "YTA. I swear too and if you were joking then you wouldn\u2019t be the asshole but it\u2019s obvious that you\u2019re actually genuinely upset about this so it wasn\u2019t truly a joke.", "NTA, but you guys got married and weren't on the same page with this sort of humor? You may have rushed some things there.  Maybe it was something else though, and that just tipped him into being angry with you.  Not an expert, but I'm going to assume there is another underlying issue within this somewhere.", "ESH. You know he doesn\u2019t like it when you swear, so why direct it at him? And why on gods green earth has he never let you sleep in?!?!", "NTA. Tell him I said he's fucking useless, and I most definitely don't mean it as a joke. Lazy ass can't even get up to take care of his own kid in the morning.", "Thank you for getting it.", "Close but it\u2019s not helping. It\u2019s being a parent and pulling his weight.", "Yeah I\u2019ve always said \u201cfuck\u201d. It\u2019s one of my favourite words. It can be used in so many different ways, and convey so much with so little. I don\u2019t recall him making much of an issue of it before we got married or had a baby. But he acts like it\u2019s new behaviour now. \n\nHe claims he doesn\u2019t recall me saying \u201cfuck\u201d much when we were dating. To be fair, I probably didn\u2019t have as many reasons to use the word back then. Life was a lot more carefree pre-baby. I rarely had to say \u201cfuck!\u201d when accidentally stepping on a Hot Wheel, or \u201cI\u2019m so fucking tired\u201d because I got to sleep when I wanted back then, or \u201cthis place is a fucking mess\u201d because there weren\u2019t 237 Matchbox cars and tractors and trucks covering almost every flat surface. There are a lot more fucks to be had nowadays (the bad ones, not the good ones loool ) \ud83d\ude04 \n\nI don\u2019t think he has a justification per se (for asking me to change my behaviour and not change his), but his response is typically \u201cwant me to quit my job? I\u2019ll trade places with you. You work and I\u2019ll stay home with him\u201d. That\u2019s not an option tho, because he would just stay on his phone or computer gaming while letting our son run amuck. He wouldn\u2019t read him books (he hates reading out loud), or sit and do puzzles with him, or play pretend to engage our son\u2019s imagination like I do. We both know it. \n\nI guess he doesn\u2019t really play those type of video games. I never really thought about that before. He likes sports video games.", "Yeah the whole thing sounds very weird and doesn't make sense for somebody who has a 2.5 year old with this person. Shocked and surprised after the first few months of dating? Sure. Just after moving in together for the first time? Maybe. But after years living with that person? How could you act like they're still a stranger to you after all this time, that their everyday behaviors are still so shocking...", "Thanks, I have talked to him sooooo many times tho. Most of our arguments stem from my exhaustion. \n\nHe says \u201cjust tell me when you want to sleep in!\u201d So I did. For my 40th birthday this year, that\u2019s all I asked for. I just wanted to sleep later than my toddler one time. Not on my actual birthday, because I love my child and wanted to spend time with him on my birthday. But on a weekend before my birthday or after my birthday, somewhere in there. \n\nHe agreed, but never followed through. He couldn\u2019t even do it for my 40th birthday.", "2.5 yr old sleep plenty", "[removed]", "He joked that he was going to stay up until 5 am, so I jokingly cursed at him for it. Nobody found any of it funny, and here we are", "I\u2019m starting to realize it wasn\u2019t completely a joke after all...\n\nEdit to add: Never. Not once. Not even when my dad died and I had his funeral at noon.", "If only I could upvote this a thousand times more!", "That\u2019s very good of you. I\u2019m sure your wife appreciates it greatly. \n\nHe also works entirely from home, and often finishes his work early and naps for at least an hour during the work day. And then he\u2019ll often nap for another hour when I\u2019m feeding dinner to our son, or putting our son to bed. \n\nThis isn\u2019t new behaviour. We both loved napping during the day and staying up late when we were dating. But when we got married and had a child, I lost the right to sleep in apparently. Whereas not much has changed for him (although I\u2019m sure he\u2019d disagree). He still gets to sleep whenever he wants to, and play video games whenever he wants to.

I said \u201cI forget how seriously you take the F word sometimes. I meant it as a joke, but you are sensitive and wouldn\u2019t see it as one, so I\u2019m sorry for saying it.\u201d\n\nBut he continued ranting. I don\u2019t even think my apology registered with him.

Today is the 1-year anniversary of my father\u2019s death. My stepmom is grieving today. To even say he\u2019s going to do that is horrible.

OP\u2019s husband is a massive AH who takes OP for granted and expects her to be a sole parent just because he works 5 days a week, yet she works 7", "It\u2019s relevant because it explains why I snapped and said \u201cfuck you\u201d after he said he\u2019d come to bed at 5 am. He can do that because he refuses to get up with our child. Something I have talked to him about many many times about rectifying so I get a chance to rest too. So yeah, it is relevant.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Why would he divorce you? You birthed his spawn, you take care of everything, he knows he has to keep up the charade to keep you there. This is fucking embarrassing OP.", "I saw this perfectly encapsulated in a tweet the other day: A great first date question is \u201cWhen you were growing up, did your Dad do house chores?\u201d That\u2019s gonna clue you in on A LOT.", "Please dont have another kid with him. He\u2019s shown you his true colors. Now it\u2019s up to you to react to it. Are you ok with this life or do you want something better?", "HE doesn't want a divorce. What about you? You just gonna stay in this relationship that sounds utterly unfullfilling and provides a negative example for your kid? HOw much more time are you going to sink into this man? You're not the asshole here except maybe to yourself. You deserve so much better.", "Then why be with him at all? \n\nYou're already a single mother. When someone asked you what he provides, your only response was he makes your son laugh, and gives you 20 min breaks here and there. And you know that even if you get really sick, you'll still have to be the full time parent? What if you're too sick to get up? What if you're hospitalized?\n\nPlease take your inheritance and makes plans for getting out of the hell you're in. He deserves every single F bomb, directed at him.\n\nNTA.", "Parent Coach here, and this IS NOT OKAY. \n\nAll of your comments have induced various negative feelings, but this one in particular is shocking. If you're sick, he still won't take care of his OWN SON!?\n\nJust because you're a SAHM doesn't mean he's not a father, and he is entirely shirking his responsibility, and to a degree that feels (from the little you've told us) abusive. \n\nDoes he control finances? Does he control what you do, who you talk to, where you go, etc? \n\nDoes he bring anything positive to your life? I'm sensing nothing happy in the way you discuss him, just a lot of (completely deserved) bitterness. Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat, or if I can help you find resources in your area. \n\nNTA x a million. \n(Also, my husband doesn't swear a lot, but he has never once tried to keep me from using my favorite words).", "I agree that you shouldn't cuss at people who have set a boundary about it. I also think his response was wildly disproportionate to the offense. Unless there's some serious context missing, a genuine apology was all that was needed for your own behavior. He should not have continued to rant after that. \n\nIn the broader context of him being a terrible partner, the swearing is not the issue. I think boundaries should be respected even when we're very upset with people. That doesn't mean that your swearing was equally bad compared to him ranting at you after an apology and generally refusing to pull his own weight. He isn't the only one who gets to have boundaries.", "This isn't how a real partnership works.", "Why don't you just divorce him? You're already a single mom anyways.", "If you wanna have a real conversation and communicate your frustration with your husband, and you do something that bothers him first, that's probably not helpful. Does he think it's funny that he gets to sleep whenever he wants and you have 24/7 child tending/ raising duties and are exhausted and jealous of his freedom?", "So was the \"fuck you\" real or a joke. Cause if it was a \"haha you silly goose\" response made cause you knew he was joking (as you claim in the original post), then no it wasn't relevant. If you actually meant it with malice because you was tired of him not being up in the morning, then you lied about meaning  it as a joke in the og post.", "Amen to that!"]}
