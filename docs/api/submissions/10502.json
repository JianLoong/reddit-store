I took a few days off before I go home because there were people and places I wanted to see. \n\nOne of those friends is Lucy (27F). Lucy was in a car accident in college and lost the use of her legs. She uses a wheelchair now. \n\nI stayed with her one night and I was talking about my plans for the next day - a national park that I loved as a child - and she was like \u201comg I haven\u2019t been there since I was a kid, can I come with you?\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re ancient cave ruins.

As far as trails, the main loop is ehhhh for a chair and the rest are impossible. It\u2019s, by nature, not an accessible activity. I know she for sure knows this so I was a little surprised when she said she wanted to come. And a little hesitant because I wasn\u2019t looking to change my plans but I didn\u2019t want to say \u201cno, I don\u2019t think you can do it\u201d so I told her that I really wanted to get up into the ruins and go see some of the more hidden ones. I wanted to take my time because it\u2019s just such a special feeling place especially in the winter  and I was very clear that I was planning on spending several hours there. \n\nAnd she said she would love to go as far as she could and she\u2019d bring a book to read while I go off. Which sounded great to me and I agreed.\n\nSo we get to the park and it\u2019s good at first and then the trail starts getting tougher for her so I help her find a suitable spot and get her book out and then off I go.\n\nI spent a little less than two hours on my own, having a great time. \n\nI get back to the spot where we split and she\u2019s crying. She yells at me for taking so long, that she was hungry, that she had to pee and that her phone died. She said \u201cI thought you\u2019d change your mind about just leaving me here in the woods for the this long. I\u2019d thought you\u2019d be back after 30 minutes\u201d and I said, \u201cwell that was dumb of you\u201d and she called me a selfish c*nt. We drove back in silence and when we got to her place, I went in to grab my bag and her boyfriend berated me for \u201cabandoning\u201d her. \n\nShe\u2019s all over social media right now talking about the \u201cableism she experienced\u201d and I\u2019m getting madder and madder and before I let my feelings spin out more, I wanna know if I\u2019m the ah", "created_utc": 1676926454, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/117k82j/aita_for_leaving_my_friend_on_the_side_of_a_trail/", "score": 296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Edited to say:  it was unkind to say she was dumb.  On the other hand, you were **very clear** about your desire to really explore and spend a great deal of time at the park.

Honestly, she shouldn't have insisted on coming to a non accessible location knowing your plans were to stay for a few hours or explore and enjoy just assuming you would change your mind and go back for her.  You only slightly sucked because you have into her demands knowing the park was non accessible and if she needed to pee or something happened she would be essentially stranded without you.  My mom has mobility issues and as heartbreaking as it is sometimes to leave her behind, sometimes we have to just because it's not safe.  The fact that she is blasting you on socials you have 2 choices : you can ignore it and go NC with her because of her tantrum or you can explain what really happened to everyone and leave them to judge who was really on the wrong here.  The fact that she can no longer enjoy certain places because of her disability sucks but that's not on you to fix.  Help as a friend, sure, but not cancel your plans because she had expectations she didn't voice.", "I am going with ESH, I say this as someone that hikes with my disabled wheelchair bound father all the time it is not easy and takes way more planning than most people can comprehend. I have slowly carried him and his chair separately up many mountains. The biggest mistake you BOTH made was not making a clear plan for how long you would be gone.", "ESH. You should have talked about how long you would be gone for. She shouldn\u2019t be upset with you that her phone died. Bad situation all around.", "Definitely an ESH moment.\nYou could\u2019ve set a time limit to come back, but I feel that your friend has no one to blame but themself about the phone. Maybe charge it fully before coming? There\u2019s no need to keep using it to the point of death when it\u2019s suppose to be a sightseeing trip more or less. She AGREED to it, she could\u2019ve taken some precautions, but that still doesn\u2019t keep you out of it either. Specification was key here.

I was very nearly going to say E S H because of it... but she made it quite clear that she understood exactly what your plans were, and came up with the idea to stay behind on the trail herself - she just expected you to change your mind with no prompting once you got there and come back out of guilt. You communicated clearly, she did not, and then she blamed you for not following the script she made up in her head. So between that and her blasting you on socials, she's the bigger AH by a mile. \n\nIt's not ableist to accept a disabled person's choice to go to an inaccessible place. Nor to respect their autonomy when they insist on a course of action that may put them in a difficult position.

An adult is perfectly capable of determining their own limits and the friend should not have invited herself on a hiking trip if she was unwilling to be responsible for herself.

She said I can work with those. \n\nDay of:  She did not communicate her needs.  Were you supposed to read her mind?\n\nBut with phone dead, etc I would be scared too.

While I can\u2019t fully put myself in her shoes I\u2019ll judge this just thinking I\u2019d the plan was just bad from the start and you should have known regardless of what she said. And that\u2019s even stretching it because I get you\u2019re not a mind reader. But her plan was to go on a nature roll and sit outside on or near the trail for a few hours while you explore inaccessible places. That sounds like a lovely afternoon. Getting out to a scenic area and reading for a few hours. So she invited herself to spend the day with you knowing exactly what you were doing. Had a plan on how she would spend the time. Then went crazy calling you awful things when she assumed you would have done something different. She is no friend.", "So this was some kind of test. NTA.", "Oh.  It sounds like your friend is a professional victim who is using this incident to gain attention and pity on social media.  I would just dump this friend.  NTA.", "NTA she was trying to guilt you. Move on", "NTA- she said she could wait and she couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s her problem.", "Info: What's the name of the park, I wanna check it out >.>", "NTA. I\u2019m the disabled friend. I\u2019ll often hang back while my friends or family go forward. I\u2019m okay with waiting because I know I can\u2019t make it all the way.", "NTA. You were clear about your plans. She\u2019s a grown woman and needed to figure out her own food and toilet needs ahead of time. Sheesh.", "NTA I'm in a wheelchair and what you did was the opposite of ableism.

It\u2019s nonsense like this that makes people think it can\u2019t be possible that someone would enjoy being alone for a whole.", "I would think the opportunity to sit in quiet and nature and just read would be rewarding enough, as long as you prepared for it (blankets, snacks, water, and bear mace).\n\nBut seriously, everyone should be prepared for the itinerary agreed upon and understand deviation isn't to be expected. Not to selfishly expect people to change their plans one way or another.\n\nNTA"]}
