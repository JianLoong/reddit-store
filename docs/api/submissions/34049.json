{"id": 34049, "submission_id": "18uk2kt", "title": "AITA For Refusing To Cover For A Coworker?", "selftext": "So the place I (21F) work at typically has the schedule posted two weeks in advance. The only way your scheduled day/time can change after that, is if you call out or if you request a shift swap or you accept someone else\u2019s request for a shift swap. For this to be finalized and approved it has to go to our head manager. Once I have my schedule for a given week, I plan accordingly. Often times, though, I don\u2019t have plans, so I\u2019m typically available to take an extra day or swap with a coworker, which has become my reputation even though I\u2019ve only been here nearly four months.\n\nSo on Thursday, I was working with Ally (18F) and our kitchen manager Darla (36F). Another coworker, Lily (25F) is currently ill and has been having to leave during her shift or call out beforehand, leaving us short those days and someone needing to step in if it\u2019s busy enough. Things were slow, but now they\u2019ve picked up considerably, making Lily\u2019s possible absence the next day a problem. I wasn\u2019t aware Lily was scheduled Friday or that she was still sick, so I wasn\u2019t suspicious when Ally asked me what I would be up to Friday. We sometimes talk about plans and parties, so I told her honestly that I was going with my partner to meet an old friend of theirs and have lunch around an hour away.\n\nLater, Ally comes up to me again while I\u2019m working to talk about how she has to come in tomorrow since Lily will likely call out, and asks if I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t come by or rain check my plans. I told her I\u2019m sorry, but no, I can\u2019t cover for her. She seems upset by this and walks off. Several minutes later, I overhear Ally and Darla discussing a scheduling conflict, and Darla pokes her head around the corner to ask me if I\u2019m available Friday to cover. I told her no, I have plans. Not long after that, our department manager comes in and is discussing the issue with them, and asks if I want to get some extra hours. I again politely declined. At this point it feels weird to me that Ally clearly didn\u2019t tell Darla I said no, and that neither of them told our DM I said no.\n\nI thought it was over after that, but while Ally and I were closing, she started complaining about having to get up early the next day and how she didn\u2019t want to work another 50 hour week. She said it wasn\u2019t fair that she had to fill in for someone while I was only scheduled for 3 days this week. I told her yeah, that sucks, but she had the option to say no, and that our managers have had no problem stepping in a couple times a month to help out if things get crazy or someone is out sick. She doesn\u2019t have to run herself into the ground.\n\nShe called me selfish and said she wouldn\u2019t have to do this if I would just cover for her instead. We finished closing in silence and she left before I did. I\u2019m working another shift with her tomorrow and I don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to go, but should I be prepared to apologize or stand my ground?

It's not your fault that she can't stand up for herself and say no.", "NTA. Ally is just mad at herself for not being strong enough to say no.

This is a management issue. You're not responsible for thin staffing.", "NTA.  Stand your ground.\n\nBut here is a life lesson for you When anyone asks you if you're busy on Saturday, if you're busy on Friday....Any day always say I'd have to look at my schedule. Because I have several doctors appointments coming up ..why what's up?\n\nThat way, they cannot bully you into giving up your life to make their lives easier.  I learned this when my neighbor said  What are you doing Saturday night? I said nothing she asked me to baby sit.  I learned!!", "NTA\nYou don't have anything to apologize for.

You have plans.", "NTA It\u2019s not your fault one coworker is sick and the other decided to pick up the shift and complain.", "NTA you have plans. And honestly? NTA even if you had zero plans for 2 reasons:\n\n1) Ally doesn't have a legitimate reason she needs off other than \"I don't wanna.\" If she didn't want the shift she should not have agreed to cover it in the first place. It would be one thing if she had been scheduled and then her mother was rushed to the hospital and you had nothing going on. Then it's kind of common decency, a team effort and a \"what if the situation was flipped\" situation. \n\n2) \"No.\" is a complete sentence. Full stop. You are never under any obligation to provide further explanation for not taking additional work/shifts beyond what you are scheduled for. It sounds like you've just learned this and it's something Ally needs to learn. Importantly- both the manager and DM seemed to understand this.

Her beef about having to come in is with management, not you.  It is the managers responsibility to fill the shifts.  If no one is available then the manager will have to step in(like you said they already do)  You have a life just like everybody else.

My bosses do not guilt trip or shame me for saying no. They never push. They don\u2019t even ask for a reason and have said before that I don\u2019t owe them any explanation. A no is enough for them."]}
