{"id": 14708, "submission_id": "12kt6pp", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to wear a menstrual pad to bed?", "selftext": "I know how odd the title sounds. My husband and I are both 29 and we have been together for 7 years now. \n\nBack when my husband was 19 he had a surgery performed on his tailbone for a pilonidal cyst removal. Now.. it's very common for these incision sites to never fully heal. I had the same surgery last year and I was lucky to have mine heal up just fine. However my husband's never did. His can go months with no issues at all but then it will randomly start oozing puss/blood out of nowhere and to be blunt, it fucking stinks. You can physically smell the infection. Doesn't matter how much he cleans the infected area. Doesn't matter how much he showers. During these periods, which can last from days to weeks, our bedding needs to be washed every single day because he either bleeds/gets puss on the sheets or it just physically repulses me from the smell of it- which lingers. And of course it's not his fault. As I said, it's common for these incision sites to never heal. If you look up the surgery process on Google there are hundreds of stories of the incision site simply never healing over. But it's becoming sickening to me, probably because I'm pregnant and smells are truly bothering me to a point of vomiting. \n\nNow.. my husband actually will put a menstrual pad in the back of his boxers during his day at work so he doesn't ruin his clothing so he has no issues at all with wearing them. There's no hang up there. But when he gets home, he just discards the pad and goes to sleep as usual and bleeds/soils the bedding with his puss. Maybe it's because me sense of smell is heightened now, but I can literally smell it without even walking in to the bedroom (I never could before so it must be the pregnancy, honestly). So yesterday I asked him to please put a menstrual pad in his boxers before bed. He kind of looked at me like I had ten heads before saying he shouldn't have to. That it's uncomfortable for him and he's worried about it rubbing in his sleep. I told him I understood that but the smells are starting to nauseate me and I'm getting quite tired of having to wash our bedding every day as soon as he gets up just to ease my stomach. He's trying to say that it's not going to \"stop the smell\" but I beg to differ. If it wasn't on the bedding, the smell wouldn't be lingering. I did absolutely push the issue and he got angry with me, stating that I'm willing to put him in an uncomfortable and potentially painful (we don't know if it would be painful, as he's never tried) situation for my own needs, which is \"selfish at best\". AITA for still insisting he wear one until the infection goes away?\n\nETA: he has been back to the doctor about this but was told nothing other than him just needing to keep the area clean.", "created_utc": 1681400276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kt6pp/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_wear_a_menstrual/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he refuses to wear one, I would demand he sleep elsewhere and clean his own sheets. And why is it selfish to not want your communal bedroom to stink?", "NTA\n\n'It's too uncomfortable!' *laughs in female.*\n\nIt's not good to be washing your sheets EVERY day, it's bad for the environment, bad for your sheets, and bad for your bills. \n\nAnd yeah, it's not always pleasant wearing a pad, but neither is sleeping in pus-y, bloody sheets and clothing. He'll protect his clothing but not the bed? Sheets and clothing can be washed, but mattresses can't. Why is he ok with that?", "NTA. An open wound should be dressed. He could get an infection. You should not be exposed to his infected body fluids either. How would he feel if you didn\u2019t wear a pad or tampon to bed during your period? Would he be changing the sheets for you every day?", "He's calling you selfish? First of all, he needs to wash the bedding. He's the one soiling it. Second, your request is not unreasonable. Would he rather wear adult diapers? Because that's his other option. Pads are designed to withstand friction, otherwise, women wouldn't put them next to the most sensitive part of our bodies.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  This is yet another depressing example of a \"partner\" who will make an adjustment when it impacts him (in this case) or his work, but won't show up for his  (pregnant!) spouse.  Of course it isn't a problem for him.  He gets to be comfortable - not wearing a dressing (!!!) and oozing all over the sheets (!!!!), because he knows you'll handle it for him.  \n\nSleep separately and stop washing the bedding.  Let him figure this out on his own.\\*  Also, he should go back to the doctor, because that doesn't sounds healthy.  \n\n\\*I think this will need to be resolved, one way or the other, before the child is born, because I would imagine that exposing a newborn to the infection would be very problematic.", "He needs to see a specialist. It\u2019s what I did. A normal doctor does leave it like this but a specialist can actually do a more in-depth surgery completely solving this issue. There is still clearly a hair in there. If you are being told \u201csometimes they just don\u2019t heal\u201d you are being told WRONG. That is only the case when you\u2019re not seeing a specialist who is specifically in practice to fix this. \n\nMy biological family all has this issue as well and only a couple listened to me when I told them to go find a specialist. My birth mother didn\u2019t listen and ended up with an anal fissure after years of repeated infections popping back up. Low and behold they *then* realized there actually was more that could be done.\n\nTell husband that infection is one thing, but an anal fissure is a whole other game.\n\nNAH. He just needs help but also needs to understand this is disgusting", "NTA. You cannot handle the smell, and it's not hygienic to be getting blood and pus all over your sheets every night. If he can handle wearing it at work to protect his clothes (that he changes every day anyway), then he can wear it in bed to protect sheets that most people typically do NOT change every day.", "NTA- I feel for your husband in this situation I really do, but he's saying he doesn't want to be uncomfortable but it's fine for you to be uncomfortable because he refuses to find a proper solution for this? He's making you sleep on soiled sheets daily and is keeping a pungent odor around while you're pregnant...\n\nHas your husband every gone back to the Dr to discuss properly healing this wound? Or how to deal with sleeping on it in a safe and comfortable way for him, so he's not oozing everywhere???", "NTA he either does that or you sleep apart if possible. I hope he's washing the bedding and changing the bed daily? \n\nCan't he wear a dressing though?", "NTA. \n\nIf changing the sheets is \"your\" chore during the ordinary course of things, then changing the sheets when he's having a cyst flare-up should automatically become his chore. Hell, even if you still make the bed he should be stripping it and setting the washing machine going before he heads to work of a morning.\n\nLike if you accidentally wet the bed, or got period blood on the sheets and should be the one responsible for washing them the next morning, he should be stripping the bed and putting the sheets in the wash when he's having a cyst flare.\n\nIf he's getting blood and pus on the sheet, then that's going to soak through to the mattress topper or mattress, depending on whether you use a topper or not. It will linger. The smell will build up and that's just gross.\n\nIf he doesn't want to use a self-adhesive disposable menstrual pad when he's having one of these flare-ups, then he should be investing in incontinence pads for beds like [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/bed-protectors-incontinence/s?k=bed+protectors+for+incontinence). They can be disposable (more costly but he just pulls it off the bed in the morning and tosses it out), or reusable (he should be the one responsible for ensuring they end up in the wash every morning if that's the case). \n\nBut he needs to do *something*. Even if you weren't pregnant, it's still gross to make your spouse deal with the byproduct of your infection if it's something you can handle on your own. The fact that you're pregnant and it's a known fact that a person's sense of smell heightens when they're pregnant, just makes him triple the asshole.", "NTA \u2018Uncomfortable and potentially painful\u2019 i hate to be the bearer of obvious news but you\u2019re literally pregnant right now. You\u2019re probably constantly uncomfortable and at the end of this you will be in a painful situation so you two can have a child.\n\nIts really not a big ask for him to wear a pad so you can be slightly more comfortable, in a time where your whole day is spent growing another human. Where is his perspective?\n\nHowever; you should definitely not be putting up with this. He should be washing the bedding he soiled. And if he\u2019s unwilling to compromise, you should not sleep in that room.", "1. Make another Dr's appointment because this should get cleared up or it'll be what kills him when he's elderly. \n\n2.

Its amazing how often an attitude changes when the person involved has to do the clean up.", "Doggy pee pad-put it on top of the fitted sheet. It\u2019s thin, plastic lined, soft, smooth, unobtrusive, removable and disposable.\n\nThey make them for humans, too, and I\u2019m sure it has a more polite name\u2026 but the human version is still essentially a doggy training pee pad and you can find them at most big box stores. NTA", "NTA. \n\nIf you have a period, next time you\u2019re on your period free bleed, then when he asks you to put a pad or tampon on/in, say \u201cwhy should I have to? It\u2019s uncomfortable.\u201d Perhaps he\u2019ll get it then. As if pads aren\u2019t incredibly uncomfortable to sleep in for people who use them for periods. Why does he think he gets a pass just because he doesn\u2019t wanna?", "NTA. It's honestly pretty ridiculous that he'll wear it to work but not to bed. He's ruining bed linens and stinking up the place. Do y'all have a mattress protector at least?", "NTA but first of all, he needs to be the one washing the bedding if he's the one messing it up. Why is that your task?!\n\nAlso, if he's not willing to wear an adult diaper or pad and you're nauseous, you or he should be sleeping in a different bed, and he's a selfish AH.", "NTA. If the pad doesn't rub and cause pain after wearing it all day, your husband needs to STFU and try the experiment - or he needs to get off his ass and change the bedding every morning, and at least start the wash cycle so you don't deal with the smell.", "I would suggest seeing a wound specialist or a plastic surgeon. General PCPs are not equipped to deal with these things. My dad needed a second one to clear the glands and revise the edges and it closed right up. And if he honestly think the pads going to hurt than get an incontinence pad or a sex pad. They're just quilted waterproof pads that you sleep on top of. They are easier to manage. And make sure he understands that is his DAILY responsibility to clean and maintain it while he is oozing.", "NTA.  Gotta remember the goal is to solve the problem not win the solution. If pad doesn't work for him, fine but absolutely we can not end this on \"deal with it.\" He has to try SOMETHING, offer SOME option or attempt.", "NTA What. The. Actual. Fuck. I couldn't sleep with that, absolutely disgusting.\n\nWhy are you responsible for cleaning the sheets every day?? Do you have a spare bed?", "nta. that's disgusting", "NTA: yes his condition isn't his fault but failing to deal with it is.\n\nIf you had a condition where you soiled the bed every night but refused to wear an adult diaper that would be unacceptable, as is this.", "No judgment but he needs to see a doctor like yesterday. Or a different doctor if this one just dismisses it. That\u2019s a major quality of life issue.", "NTA but perhaps you could get a few adult mattress pads (used for incontinence, recovering from surgery, even good for heavy menses too) to use instead?  They go on top of the sheet and be washed alot easier than the bottom sheet.  Get several and you can change them out if needed, including overnight if the smell gets too bad.\n\nBut it doesn't sound good if he keeps getting nasty infections like that.  I'd seek out additional medical attention on it.  Those things can lead to complications which are far worse.", "INFO: has your husband seen a doctor about this? You say it's common for it not to heal, but it seems really strange to me that a physician would just look at an open wound that is clearly infected and oozing for the last decade and wouldn't...do something about that?", "NTA - He can also get Depends or any other adult diaper of his own choice, especially if he\u2019s not the one doing the laundry. I\u2019m assuming you are pregnant. During postpartum period, even changing sheets could trigger worse bleeding on a new mom. You don\u2019t need that.", "NTA. It makes no sense to do nothing to prevent getting this mess over the sheets. \n\nThere are other options maybe - cloth menstrual pads may feel less uncomfortable. Or maybe period underpants - I\u2019m sure they make cuts for men, and the coverage area might be sufficient to reach that area.", "NTA!  Why does his comfort matter and not yours?   Also he should be the one washing the sheets.   I got nauseous just reading about this.   I know the husband can't help it but he should be considerate of his pregnant wife.   That's unsanitary just letting blood and puss leak around in a shared bed.", "As someone with one of these incisions that never healed properly, you are NTA. The smell is vomit inducing and quite embarrassing.\n\nMy SO helps me clean the are and places gauze over the wound and tapes it on. It works much better than a pad because it doesn't move or rub.", "What the fuck did I just read. I\u2019m currently suffering from a pilonidal cyst and I would never just BLEED ALL OVER THE FURNITURE. That is so fucking gross.", "NTA-  He should be more responsible for his hygiene, but.... Has he seen a doctor that actually specializes in wound care? Has he at least seen your doctor that successfully treated you? If there's no more surgical solutions, he should at least have a more consistent regimen of treatment than just wearing a pad on top.  (ex. gauze with wound gel, dressings, etc.)  The pus is the more concerning part to me and if he doesn't get that infection taken care of,  that smell isn't going to diminish.  He probably needs that area to be re-drained along with antibiotics.  You need to convince him to get a second opinion from a specialist who can at least help him fight that infection.", "Make sure to tell him that you will not be using pads in bed once you have your period again. It's not comfy for him, so it's not comfy for you.", ">I'm willing to put him in an uncomfortable and potentially painful (we don't know if it would be painful, as he's never tried) situation for my own needs,\n\nAs opposed to PREGNANCY which is uncomfortable and *definitely* painful?\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Your heightened sensitivity is directly related to your pregnancy, so if you both chose to have this baby, he needs to ease your ongoing discomfort in any way he can, even if it gives him a little discomfort.", "I\u2019ve never had a period before (MRKH syndrome, it\u2019s so good) so forgive me if I\u2019m wrong, but don\u2019t people who menstruate have pads for sleeping? Don\u2019t they design pads specifically for sleeping? Where did he get the painful thing from? \n\nNTA anyway, if it was a random nose bleed or re-opened cut would he bleed in the sheets? Probably not. Would anything from a first aid type box work and he be comfortable with? Bandage and tape? Sorry if that\u2019s a stupid suggestion, I dunno how big the wound is.", "NTA.  As someone who has also dealt with pilonidal cysts, I know that smell and I would never want to force it on someone else.  I actually did use menstrual pads while I recovered, based on the recommendation of a nurse.  I'm a dude, but it never bothered me.  It's just an absorbant bandage designed to stick to underwear, which is exactly what you need in that situation.\n\nAlso, I'll add myself to the chorus saying that he should see another doctor about this.  My first surgery (performed by a general surgeon) never healed right and another cyst formed. I had another surgery, performed by a colo-rectal surgeon and he actually grafted on some extra flesh from one of my butt cheeks instead of just sewing up the wound.  That time, it healed perfectly and I haven't had any issues in the 20 years since then.  And finally, even if nothing else can be done for him, I would recommend that he takes more care to keep the area clean and dry, as it seems like the area is getting infected more often than it should.", "NTA", "NTA.  But, have your husband go see a wound care specialist.  My husband's wound didn't heal property initially, so the surgeon went back in.  The subsequent surgical wound was much larger but healed wonderfully after working with a wound care specialist.  It took months to heal completely (as is normal), but healing was jump started by a wound-vac - an absolutely amazing piece of specialized equipment - one his regular doctor probably doesn't have in his arsenal.", "NTA - so you're selfish for not wanting to be violently ill over something that he could wear something to help with the clean up of...the clean up HE DOESN'T DO? I hope you show him the responses to this post.", "NTA. If a menstrual pad is too uncomfortable for the poor muffin, he can wear an adult diaper or sleep in another room on a blowup bed that can easily be cleaned.", "Sorry, but this would be a hill I would die on, yuck!!! NTA", "If calling her selfish will shut her up, a distressed, embarrassed and frightened guy who\u2019s got a laundry maid to sleep with will certainly do so. It doesn\u2019t have to be true. It just has to work. OP, please do not start apologizing. He needs to see a doctor.", "NTA. I have the exact same cyst, and it\u2019s a mess when it acts up. A pad sounds like a much more comfortable option than what I had to do at first, which was have someone use a stick to shove gauze into the wound.", "YTA how dare you suggest he wear a menstrual pad\ud83d\ude24 you should get him a diaper since he wants to act like a baby \ud83e\udd70", "If it\u2019s still not healed and leaking pus and blood, he prob needs to see a Doc about this. Not good to live with an ongoing infected, open wound with a pus pocket and bleeding. Not to mention you\u2019re gonna be busy cleaning up after a baby soon.", "Would a towel work or a wash cloth as it's really comfortable to sleep on and won't make the bedding smell.", "NTA, but you need to get him to a different specialist, it's meant to heal. I got one removed just over a year ago and my doctor said it should heal, but for men it can take longer because of the amount of hair they have. By longer, he meant 6 months rather than the 6-8 weeks he suspected my healing would take. (Mine closed in 2 weeks and was completely healed within a month, but I have a skin condition that probably caused it and the medicine for my condition may have helped increase the healing. At least, that's what my doctor suspects.)\n\nAlso, for those who don't know. For pilonidal cysts, they don't close the wounds. They open them up, clean them out, and then have you change the bandages. Sutures or anything other than naturally healing almost always leads to infection according to my doctor. Still, I don't know how OP's husband has gotten this far without a doctor intervening. A wound should not still be open/opening after a decade.", "NTA. But uhhh\u2026I\u2019m in healthcare and that doesn\u2019t seem normal to me\u2026Has he gotten a second opinion?", "maybe try puppy pads on his side of the bed so you can just throw those out in the morning?", "NTA.  If he doesn\u2019t want to use a pad he could use ordinary wound care materials. \n\nAnd honestly, he should seek some more care because although these cysts are literally an ongoing PITA, he needs to discuss next steps with a doc.", "NTA my friends had a roommate with this problem a few years ago, all bros in their early twenties. They had to throw out the couch. Dudes in their early twenties, messy, pothead dudes, were grossed out by that smell.", "NTA.\n\n>I'm willing to put him in an uncomfortable and potentially painful  situation for my own needs\n\nYou're muscling in on his territory.  He wants to be the one putting you in an uncomfortable situation with the lingering smell.", "NTA. Adding this to the list of \"I wish I'd never googled this\" medical conditions. He should give you the courtesy he gives others (at least) and cover the wound when he's in bed. If he can wear it when he goes to work, he can wear it for your comfort.", "NTA.\nWould he be willing to place a puppy pad type product underneath while he sleeps so it can be tossed and get on with the day?", "NTA \n\nI am unfortunately in the same boat as your husband. But what I do is get a little square of gauze, put it over the spot and use tegaderm to seal it. It will stay on all night, it doesn\u2019t pull because it\u2019s flexible, and it\u2019s not painful to take off. Also, baby oil is great for breaking down adhesive. That\u2019s something he could wear all day as well. Hope this helps!", "He wants to tell you what uncomfortable feels like?!? This must be your first child and I'd guess you're in your first trimester when smells are particularly nauseating. \n\nNTA. Your husband is. You can get him some disposable underwear you'll be wearing for weeks after birth and the pad will stick in there just fine. \n\nQuery if he wants you to free bleed after you give birth or if that might be a bit disgusting to him.", "NTA. \n\nHe cannot leave pus in the bed you sleep in. End of. He has an open infection and you are pregnant and vulnerable to illness, not to mention it\u2019s gross.\n\nHe can decide on a pad, a bandage, sleeping on a different bed or couch, whatever. But he does not get to smear blood and pus all over the bed and be mad when you tell him to fucking stop.\n\nAlso, he had no idea if it will stop the smell, and since he KNOWS it stinks, why isn\u2019t he washing the sheets and the bedding? Why is his solution \u201cdo nothing at all\u201d?", "NTA. How does he think us women feel when we have to wear pads 24/7 for a week straight? This is laughable honestly. If we can handle it so can he. It's a lot better than staining your clothes and sheets and would save you money from having to replace severly stained sheets all the time. Either he needs to start wearing it at night too or you need to sleep in seperate bedrooms and let him clean up his mess unless he wants to sleep in his filth. That way he can smell himself and you don't have to smell it at all.", "NTA\n\nIf he gets blood and press all over the bed he's also putting your pregnancy at risk. This could seriously give you an infection in your womb. \n\nThe fact that you smell it better if probably pregnancy related. A lot at other women have an increased sense of smell and are more likely to detect that something is rotting/ no longer good.\n\nLast fall (at the start of my pregnancy) at my parents they gave me a glass of milk and it just smelled all sour. No one believed me that it was off, so they warmed some for their coffee. And lo and behold, it would not foam (a sign that milk is no longer good). So then they believed me. \nDespite not believing me they still opened up a new carton of milk for me though, so I didn't go without milk.", "NTA.\n\nWhat are you going to do when you have the baby? Let the kid crawl on blood and puss stained sheets? Let the kid get blood/puss on his/her hands and then stick them in his/her mouth?\n\nYour husband needs to, at minimum, stop spreading blood and puss around your household. Seeing a specialist like u/FlyingWithAliens mentioned is probably a good long term solution, but he needs to stop spreading filth around now.", "NTA\nIt's his baby you are growing right? Ypur sense of smell is heightened in a pregnancy and the smell of your husband is making your nauseous. If he can be self aware enough to keep his clothes clean during the day and at work, he certainly should be mindful of you. Honestly if he can't put you first during your pregnancy then it doesn't bode well for how things will be when baby arrives.", "NTA AT ALL. He should not be asking you to sleep in a puss infested bed. I know people with this same issue, it does smell, it is gross, and keeping it clean is always the best way to deal with this. He can wear a pad or some other cover to prevent it from leaking into bed. If he's worried about rubbing it, he can sleep on his stomach, letting it leak everywhere is unhygienic at best.", "NTA.  I too had a pilonidal cyst and I\u2019ll never forget how much it reeked when it was lanced.

I later had surgery and it never came back.  \n\nThat your DH seems to be concerned about it not leeching at work but doesn\u2019t give a darn when he is home is problematic.  If you can, sleep in another room and let him launder the sheets.  And tell him to see a specialist- this isn\u2019t normal.", "Girlie, stop washing his nasty bedding and do not sleep with him. That is absolutely atrocious. Of course he isn\u2019t going to change his behavior to accommodate you when you just fix his mess for him. Nobody at work is gonna wash his laundry (or love him despite his puss and blood being visible) so he accommodates them. He should be willing to do that AND MORE for his wife and unborn baby. \n\nLiterally, sleep on the couch if you have to (although he should feel shitty if you do because you\u2019re pregnant). \n\nAnd if he ruins your mattress by neglecting cleaning duties\u2026.

You can get reusable chucks at a medical supply store.  They're fabric, go over the bedding, can be swapped out easily and you don't have to change all bedding.  The used ones can be moved to an area that doesn't bother you, and he can do his own laundry of chucks.", "Adult diapers is the next step.", "NTA!!\nHe needs to be sleeping on a puppy pad or incontinence sheets then. By himself. Disgusting.", "I know you state that these things sometimes never heal, but you also left out if he has ever gone back to the doctor. This is starting to dip into the quality of life area of medicine and they should be doing something to help make this better in a more permanent way. \n\nI am not giving him an out or condoning his stance, but just remember that this is probably very embarrassing for for him. Coming home after wearing a feminine pad all day if probably his only chance to feel \"normal\" all day. This does not mean he gets to ignore his impact to you, but more of an explanation on why he may be touchy.\n\nWhile I don't think YTA, or he is TA, I think a more calm discussion while the infection is not going on to come up with a plan and reasonable expectations might go over better than trying to have that conversation will emotions are high.\n\nI am voting NTA, but if it wasn't for the emotional responses making things hard to have a productive conversation, I would say it is close to ESH.", "Ok, get special large plasters for him?\n\nTbf the pad rubbing in his sleep would probably make it worse, also pads have perfume which might actually irritate the area more.", "This is a tough one. Your husband isn\u2019t necessarily wrong. Friction and shear don\u2019t just make a wound more painful. It can literally make a sound worse. I see a lot of people insisting it should be dressed or covered. Typically, it is not recommended to trap moisture against skin. Many hospitals do not allow incontinence pads for this reason. This becomes even more important when we\u2019re talking about an actively infected wound. Would it be possible for you to ask for a referral to a specialist? Perhaps even a consultation with a wound/ostomy nurse? Doctors get recommendations from these type of nurses ALL the time because literally all they do is wound care. \n\nI\u2019m voting NAH because you want and deserve to be comfortable and so does he. This is surely a taxing situation for both of you. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want that wound on his body any more than you want to deal with the situation. He may have some body image struggles and the menstrual bad suggestion could come across as emasculating, not to mention you don\u2019t actually know if that is the best way to care for the wound. \n\nGet another opinion, please.

My husband and I are both 29 and we have been together for 7 years now. \n\nBack when my husband was 19 he had a surgery performed on his tailbone for a pilonidal cyst removal. Now.. it's very common for these incision sites to never fully heal. I had the same surgery last year and I was lucky to have mine heal up just fine. However my husband's never did. His can go months with no issues at all but then it will randomly start oozing puss/blood out of nowhere and to be blunt, it fucking stinks. You can physically smell the infection. Doesn't matter how much he cleans the infected area. Doesn't matter how much he showers. During these periods, which can last from days to weeks, our bedding needs to be washed every single day because he either bleeds/gets puss on the sheets or it just physically repulses me from the smell of it- which lingers. And of course it's not his fault. As I said, it's common for these incision sites to never heal. If you look up the surgery process on Google there are hundreds of stories of the incision site simply never healing over. But it's becoming sickening to me, probably because I'm pregnant and smells are truly bothering me to a point of vomiting. \n\nNow.. my husband actually will put a menstrual pad in the back of his boxers during his day at work so he doesn't ruin his clothing so he has no issues at all with wearing them. There's no hang up there. But when he gets home, he just discards the pad and goes to sleep as usual and bleeds/soils the bedding with his puss. Maybe it's because me sense of smell is heightened now, but I can literally smell it without even walking in to the bedroom (I never could before so it must be the pregnancy, honestly). So yesterday I asked him to please put a menstrual pad in his boxers before bed. He kind of looked at me like I had ten heads before saying he shouldn't have to. That it's uncomfortable for him and he's worried about it rubbing in his sleep. I told him I understood that but the smells are starting to nauseate me and I'm getting quite tired of having to wash our bedding every day as soon as he gets up just to ease my stomach. He's trying to say that it's not going to \"stop the smell\" but I beg to differ. If it wasn't on the bedding, the smell wouldn't be lingering. I did absolutely push the issue and he got angry with me, stating that I'm willing to put him in an uncomfortable and potentially painful (we don't know if it would be painful, as he's never tried) situation for my own needs, which is \"selfish at best\". AITA for still insisting he wear one until the infection goes away?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I know you said laundry is your job but this is preventable and he\u2019s choosing to not prevent it. My husband takes medicine that gives him diarrhea daily. He doesn\u2019t always make it. I normally clean the bathroom but when that happens he cleans it.", "Have you thought about period underwear?  I'm pretty sure they make some in men's sizes and they def have boxer ones", "Nta at all. My husband had an L3-S2 spinal fusion with no complications, but the wound wept for weeks w/o infection and would seep through the gauze bandages. I would dress the wound and then put a sanitary napkin over it using some paper tape to keep his clothes and bedding clean. Luckily, he didn\u2019t have any skin issues with the bandaging adhesives. Good luck. Hopefully this will work out. It sounds like your husband needs a wound care specialist. Ask about hyperbaric therapy.", "NTA but can he get something like period panties? A quick google is showing me some men's options--I think they're aimed at trans men but could also be useful for his situation, and more comfortable.", "NTA But why aren't you guys just taping a bandage on ?", "NTA, but him some adult diapers if the pad is uncomfortable", "This doesn\u2019t sound normal to me it shouldn\u2019t be leaking puss and blood for this long", "Rather than force the issue, would a compromise work?\n\nCould your husband use a surgical dressing overnight instead? \n\nThese would soak up any blood or pus while keeping it contained and they're much smaller and less intrusive than a menstrual pad.", "NTA but he needs to get a second opinion, none of this sounds normal. He also needs to start washing his sheets. I couldn\u2019t sleep next to him, he\u2019s an AH not you.", "Start free bleeding in the bed an make him do laundry every day that week\n\n\nWhen he complains tell him to shove it as he does the same thing", "NTA But I\u2019d look into some other options. Tomboy X has some very comfortable leakproof boxers. A bit pricy, but they\u2019re worth it imo. Disposable incontinence underwear is also an option, but they tend to be less comfortable.", "NTA. Smh", "Listen, the only times something never heals is if there is a underlining medical condition such as uncontrolled diabetes, pvd, or the site isn't properly managed ( wrong treatment, area not debredid etc...your husband  site needs a surgeon to go in, clean the are and the cause and then the correct treatment", "NTA. tell him if he's so worried about that then he'll be fine if you free bleed post partum.", "Lol. Once you are done growing a tiny human, you could turn the tables on him. After giving birth, just refuse to wear pads. Freebleed just like him. Preferrably on his side of the bed. See how he likes it. \n\nUntil then: he gets the sheets nasty, he washes and replaces them. No discussion. \n\nNTA", "What the fuck? Maybe he should get that stitched back up?? NTA. Maybe he\u2019d prefer period panties?\n\nOozing so much puss that it\u2019s getting through clothes and onto the bed is probably not healthy..\n\nAlso. What the fuck.", "It\u2019s really too bad you\u2019re pregnant right now\u2026 because if you weren\u2019t I\u2019d tell you to free bleed and see how he likes that\u2026", "NTA, after you give birth start free bleeding whenever you get your period and see how he likes it.", "Menstrual pads on wounds can make things a lot worse. He needs a referral to a wound specialist and to get his diabetes under control if he\u2019s diabetic. Meanwhile, get Betadine and ABD pads at the drugstore and he needs to wash the area daily and keep it covered with the ABD pad.", "Male Depends perhaps?", "NTA. He needs to either insist with his medical practioner or find a new one. \n\nIf its an infection he should have something he can put on it and/or take to help remove the infection.", "NTA. He needs to sleep in another room then and wash his own sheets.", "NTA\n\nHe probably has no idea how bad he smells.

Get the man to a colo-rectal surgeon \ud83d\ude27\ud83e\udd22\ud83d\ude2c seriously... y'all don't have to live like this. \n\nThis is like bread and butter for a colo-rectal surgeon. They usually have a wound care nurse to help their patients, too. It won't be a two week adventure, but he can get this handled. His life will be so much better afterward. \n\nLike what one commenter said, what you don't want is to let this turn into a fistula. Talk about long healing and painful...", "NTA\n\nAs my patience dwindles, I\u2019d be searching for way to let him out himself, but make it look like he did it to himself.", "I wouldn\u2019t sleep with him. Set up in spare room/on the couch. Show him with your behavior that you mean what you say. He fucking stinks. Let him deal with his own puss sheets and sleep in his own filth.", "Wait why are YOU doing the laundry for his gross leakage? NTA.", "NTA. Is he seeing a dermatologist and does he have specific wound care instructions including products to use?", "And why isn\u2019t he washing the sheets?!", "I thought the same thing. I bet he\u2019d be feeling a lot different if she was the one free bleeding everywhere. \n\nPads and tampons are uncomfortable so who needs to wear them?! Let\u2019s all just bleed on the sheets s/", "He's not willing to be slightly uncomfortable for the women who is growing his child with her body and vomiting from the puss he is leaving on the sheets??? Seriously?  She is gonna push a damn person out of her vagina and he can't take a little rubbing from a soft cotton pad?  \n\nFrankly rubbing pus on sheets a pregnant lady is sleeping on is horrifying and I'm petty sure if she mentioned this to her OB her OB would say he has to cover it up.  If he cannot stand the slightest inconvenience for his unborn child and the comfort of his pregnant wife he is gonna be a shit father.  Mothers endure so much damage to their bodies bringing a child into the world and he can't even take some rubbing - I can't even with him.", "The word you\u2019re looking for is purulent :)", "I was going to say this. Dressing it seems like it would be easier than wearing a pad that may or may not be touching the area at any time. Taping some sterile pads to the area will protect his clothes, the furniture, keep the smell away and be fairly easy to switch out.", "For real OP, ask him what he thinks about you not wearing menstrual products to bed during your next period.", "This OP! \n\nExcept the ruling. NTA. \n\nWhen you present a problem like this, it is an us problem. He needs to help with a solution, instead of say \u201cI refuse to change a thing.\u201d If not a pad, how about a diaper? How about taped gauze? How about he sleeps on rubber sheets elsewhere? How about he has more empathy for his wife?", "Fully agree!! I went to a colorectal surgeon who was experienced with pilonidal cyst excisions and she was able to go all the way to the bone to fully remove my cyst (which was deeper than expected). Even with a closed wound surgery, it only recurred very briefly once (went away after being drained at an urgent care) - I\u2019m left with a not-so-pretty 6 inch long scar but I don\u2019t even care because it\u2019s solved. \n\nI fought the infection for a full year before my surgery. It was one of the larger and deeper ones my surgeon had dealt with, and even so I was never soaking through my underwear, pajama shorts, AND the sheets. He absolutely should see a specialist or at least get a second opinion. While some never fully heal, this seems dangerously infected long term. \n\nIn the meantime, would he be open to something like a thin cotton pad or a panty liner? Eventually I found pads too thick, but panty liners did the job and were a lot more comfortable. I also preferred bandages, with antibiotic ointment or plain Vaseline to keep the cotton from sticking, which might help with his concerns about the pain. But the panty liners helped let it breathe overnight without causing problems or discomfort!", "Make another Dry's appointment because this should get cleared up or it'll be what kills him when he's elderly.", "My husband has a similar issue as a complication from IBD. Getting a bidet was a game changer for him, so that could be something OP and her husband could do now as they wait for a specialist appointment. They aren't terribly difficult to install, unless you get one of the fancy ones that'll blow dry your ass for you.", "This is correct. I had similar surgery at the same age. It had to be redone THREE times because it wouldn't heal. (Stitched up the first 2 then left open the last time). Last one was under general anesthesia and went deep.\n\nWhat he's describing is what I went through, but my doctor didn't say \"live with it\". \n\nAlmost 50 yrs old now with no problems other than my ass looking like Frankenstein from all the stitching scars from the numerous surgeries.", "> If you are being told \u201csometimes they just don\u2019t heal\u201d you are being told WRONG.\n\nThis was my thought. I may have no personal experience with pilonidal cysts, but there's no way it's normal and expected to just bleed and leak pus like that!", "Yeah, I feel like a doctor should be at least treating with antibiotics if it's infected. What's going on here is definitely not good.", "It's got to be terrible for his overall health.  When your body is fighting an infection like that all the time it gets weakened and can't fight other things.  Sure, he's young now and it doesn't seem like a big deal but if he spends his whole life fighting off infection after infection when he's older it's gonna take a tole.  Something like this won't kill you, but it makes it a lot easier for something else to do it.", "That was my question, instead of a pad, an actual dressing/bandage might be more comfortable. \n\nAlthough my Aunt had to go back for an additional surgery since they didn't get the entire cyst the first time.", "He won't wear medical dressings because they stick and pull, which is painful for removal. But no, I'm the one who does all the laundry. He does other chores.", "Or re-usable changing pad!", "Shes pregnant xD", "We do have a mattress protector on, yes. I think it actually makes the smell worse though.", "No but my couch is pretty comfy.", "This.", "He had been back to the doctor, yes. Unfortunately there wasn't much to go off of when he did. His doctor basically told him there wasn't much he could do about it other than make sure he keeps the area clean.", "Yes, overnight menstrual pads exist, they're thicker for overnight and are longer than normal so that they have more coverage for laying down, but otherwise basically the same as normal pads\n\nI'm presuming that the husband is saying they'd be uncomfortable because they'd be rubbing on an open wound, though, which isn't an issue for people who wear them for menstruation because...well, it's not an open wound", "It\u2019s can be diffident because for women it\u2019s not like pad touching the wound area. No wound there.", "Yeah it\u2019s another case of a dude being whiny about something that women just suffer through.", "Don't think they do any big enough for this huge asshole \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc", "I just thought of op making him use baby diapers taped in his boxers\ud83d\ude02", "If a dude feels embarrassed because they had to wear a piece of cotton on a wound all day then that\u2019s their immature issue to work on.", "He went back to the doctor for it back when we first got together and his doctor didn't do anything. He basically said \"unfortunately with these types of surgeries, some of them just never heal and there's not much we can do outside of just making sure the area is clean.\" So, not much help.", "There are plenty of unscented pads. There\u2019s also disposable underwear.", "You can get unscented pads, as well as 100% cotton pads. \n\nI'm not entirely sure about pilonidal cysts, but it might not be a good idea to cover it - if it's leaking a lot and/or he doesn't have the ability to change the dressing as frequently as he needs to, having a wet and pus covered bandage will actually make the wound worse", "because he's the man, and laundry is woman's work? /s", "Exactly! And it\u2019s not a problem to him because he\u2019s not cleaning the sheets. Goddamn, the more I scroll Reddit, the more I realise the bar is so low for some men", "Snuggle up real close to him while free bleeding !", "How about period undies? It's probably not *that* much fluid, and I'll bet you could just cut the front open for his dick.", "/u/Scaredqawsfgh is a bot that copied part of this coment: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kt6pp/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_wear_a_menstrual/jg3yp6m/\n\nKinda interesting because it must have copied the text before the actual OP edited their comment to say \"Dr's\".", "He needs to be doing the bedding. And he needs to figure out how to not to bleed all over it. I assume if you just refused to wear a pad or a tampon to bed during your period and just free-bled all over the sheets he\u2019d have something to say about it!", "You shouldn't be washing the sheets...he should be.", "If he won't listen to you about this, I would say that the laundry needs to be his chore now.  Also, you should sleep separately.  You shouldn't be exposed to that.", "OK I'm confused... dressings are bad cuz they stick and pull, but the pad is ok cuz its just rubs on it instead, BUT THEN its bad cuz it rubs on it instead? Hes just being difficult...", "Totally get it. \n\nI\u2019ve had over a handful of colorectal surgeries. There\u2019s certainly a large component of psychological stuff that could be at play. Perhaps he\u2019s putting all his energy into seeming normal at work/public, and gets home and he can\u2019t keep it up. And he can\u2019t think/see clearly about how this could possibly be affecting the person he loves and loves him. \n\nThere are alternatives he can be looking into. I had a wound that took over 2 years to heal. It was torture. And I felt so down about it. If his surgeon is saying that this is just the way it is, find another opinion. No matter how far y\u2019all have to go for it. Be absolutely certain. Some surgeons have a complex that they could never do anything that needs improvement. Some surgeons just aren\u2019t up to speed with changes. I had my issues less than a decade apart and the techniques and procedures had changed and I healed much faster the second round of surgeries. \n\nThere are pads that come in different materials. Some have that plastic-y lining on top that I personally find super uncomfortable and sticks to my skin. In the last recent few years, there\u2019s been quite a push for cotton products, and they work great with my skin, I can literally never go back. \u201cL.\u201d brand at target is really wonderful. If he doesn\u2019t keep the wound as dry as he can, he\u2019s never going to heal. He needs to be changing his pads or bandages frequently. It\u2019s annoying but necessary. He also should consider sitz baths frequently (at least 2x a day). They do help. Therapy is also a great tool. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. I am on the fence about inferring that he is, however, the deciding factor is that he is causing you to carry the physical load by refusing to care for himself at home in a proper way. You\u2019ve tried to come up with solutions, but he is seemingly unable to accept anything other than what he\u2019s doing, which is unsanitary and unbearable for you to live with.", "Is he really hairy? That could be part of the problem. My doctor said the hairier someone is, the harder it is to heal. Honestly sounds like he needs to have the area around it shaved so he can use gauze since it'd be more sanitary for the wound. Plus, as I said above, please see a new specialist. His cyst should not still be open/opening after a decade.", "Sounds like washing the bedding is his job now", "Not to be too invasive, but does he wear underwear to sleep? There are several brands of \u201cperiod panties\u201d that are not insanely thick but super absorbent, perhaps he could try something like that? I\u2019m familiar with the \u201cthinks\u201d brand and it\u2019s great, but they come in all kind of sizes and absorbencies and are quite comfortable/not sticky to sleep in!", "Even better, once baby is here free bleed after she gets home - if post partum bleeding doesn't break him nothing will \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d", "Oh I missed the pregnant part haha.", "Yeah, they're not designed to absorb in perpetuity, and washing them makes still more work. If your hubby keeps refusing, I'd get a full plastic version that can be wiped down.", "If it has a cotton top it is probably absorbing.  You might want rubber sheets instead, at least as an extra layer.", "I can't get my head around smelly bodily fluids getting into the mattress, or the couch. I don't know how you can cope with it honestly. I'd be losing my mind", "It's common for these wound sites not to heal.\n\nIt's not common for frequent reinfection to occur.\n\nThe guy isn't keeping the area clean.\n\nMore than likely every time he gets an infection is a time he didn't wipe his ass sweated residue moved around and shit got into the wound site.\n\nHe needs to take some steps to keep the area clean properly.\n\nGet the hair in the entire area waxed off.\n\nShower daily paying special attention to that area.\n\nWipe his ass properly when he goes to the toilet. Add a bidet as well.\n\nFinally at the start of any discomfort he needs to start nuking the area with antiseptics and using antibiotic cream. Fend off infection before they become major.\n\nEdit to add: during a non infected time he may consider changing his underwear twice a day.\n\nAlso during periods of infection maybe he can consider showering while leaking and placing pressure on the infected area to \"pump\" quantities of pus and blood out giving a break over night. Yes it will hurt but its a major infection there will be pain sometime.", "Has he been back recently? From your description, it sounds like the cyst came back not just that the incision didn\u2019t heal.", "Yeah, but he didn't keep it clean and now it's infected. He needs to go back to the doctor and get the infection treated.\n\nNTA and your husband needs to be more on top of both his hygiene and his medical care.", "Yeah that makes a lot of sense, I\u2019m not sure what the material is like but I guess any material rubbing against a wound may hurt. Thanks!", "Right, I get you, so the friction on his wound may cause pain? That makes sense, thanks!", "I don't disagree. I was just providing some context about how he might be feeling. Like I said, not condoning.", "I would suggest he go back again, it was 10 years ago. However, if it were me, I would go back to another doctor and get a new opinion. Infections are no joke. If not treated properly or knocked out quickly, it can lead to serious complications. \n\nAlso, if he is taking antibiotics regularly when this happens, his body could build up a resistance and make it harder to eliminate the infection, or he could start to build up an allergy like my parents. They both became deathly allergic in the late 40s to penicillin based antibiotics and wear bracelets.", "It would be 8h, not over 24h. So no, it wouldn't be an issue to have a plaster on, as long as its big enough. I'd say about 4-6in bigger than the size of the wound.", "Yeah, and he has the manly role of soiling the bed sheets with blood and pus every night! It actually balances out", "\u2026and they still don\u2019t reach it is the saddest part. It breaks my heart for all of us.", "They make boxer ones", "You can get reusable/washable pads on Amazon they are much more comfortable than disposable pads as it\u2019s material they are made of and kinder to the environment than disposable pads or washing all the sheets", "Marilyn Monroe did that- but she also had a full time maid that changed her sheets a few times a day.  \n\n*insert the more you know logo*", "I'm definitely losing my mind. I've thrown up so much that my stomach hurts. I'm not even throwing anything up at this point. I'm just dry heaving. And that's with all of our windows open. \n\nLike I said, I truly did not notice the smell too often before getting pregnant. So it honestly might not even be as bad as I think it is. But holy fuck, I cannot handle it right now.", "Seriously, the husband is going to eventually get sepsis if he doesn't deal properly with the infection. Accepting oozing stinking pus as an ongoing part of life is going to one day kill him. Part of becoming a father should be wanting to be alive for at least the next 18 years. He needs to get to a doctor, get on antibiotics, and find out what steps to take to prevent reinfection.", "My dumbass read your comment and immediately went to 'wearing a plaster 24/7' \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Are they cut for men though?
