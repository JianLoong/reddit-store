For the last few weeks, she\u2019s been having trouble sleeping because of her pain as well as anxiety about the recent diagnosis. \n\nToday my wife and I were with our daughter at the doctor's. The doctor was just asking questions about how she was feeling both mentally and physically.

Since she is under the age of 18 as her parents we would have to apply as a caregiver on behalf of someone. \n\nAfter we got home my wife basically laughed at the fact the doctor suggested medical pot. I\u2019ve smoked pot occasionally throughout my life (it\u2019s legal here). I told her I think it was a good idea for our daughter if it helps her with her pain and anxiety she deserves that.

I can\u2019t even imagine the heartache and emotions in this situation. Honestly  marijuana is way better than opioids and some of the other drugs they already have her trying. I really hope your wife can come around and be supportive. You need to advocate for your daughter, and also your and your wife need to be able to lean on each other and support each other. (I hope you\u2019re also in therapy?) this is a horrible situation and my heart aches for you all", "Nta\n\nI mean, not to sound rude but what does your wife think is going to happen?

In this situation not only are you helping your daughter manage her remaining time more comfortably, but you are actually following a doctors suggestion.\n\nYour wife needs to get over her preconceptions about it, and let your daughter make the best of her remaining time.\n\nAlso. So sorry to hear this situation. Sending well wishes.", "NTA. If it would improve her quality of life, why not? Her doctor suggested it.", "NTA opioids are a thousand times more addictive drugs than pot, if she\u2019s at the terminal stage it\u2019s about what will make your daughter feel less pain not about which meds won\u2019t offend your wife\u2019s delicate sensibilities", "Nope NTA. There's been some minimal research done that pot on a developing brain can affect development. Sadly that isn't a concern here. \n\nHonestly I wouldn't judge you if you let her drink wine or do shrooms. Whatever you can do to make her comfortable that's what is important.  I am so sorry OP. This must be so hard for you.", "NTA. Please let your daughter have controlled doses of Marijuana. For pain and relaxation, I suggest the 1:1 THC/CBD variety of edibles or the tincture. The tincture can be harder to find but it only takes about 30 minutes to kick in compared to 1 hour+ for edibles. Also, have her take only half a dose (eat half an edible or use half the dropper). I've found half a dose is enough to get the pain/tension relief without making my brain high. She will still get tired from it and it will still help with sleep. There are also sleep variants of edibles that include a strain specifically to help with sleep, some even have melatonin as well.\n\nTell your wife that it is safe and effective to use for medicinal purposes without getting high.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for you, your daughter, and your family. I can\u2019t imagine how you all must be feeling. \nThat being said your daughter has a terminal illness and you said yourself that at this point you are just trying to keep her comfortable. If it helps her, then it helps her. What does it matter if she\u2019s not of the legal age yet. I think you should let her decide if she wants to try it. What really do you have to lose? (Sorry if that sounds callous, that is not my intent.)\nETA: someone else suggested edibles, I think that would be a good choice too. More of a body relaxing high, rather than straight head high from smoking.", "NTA - Do everything you can to help your baby sleep, pain-free and peacefully. It\u2019s under medical supervision and parental administration, and\u2026she\u2019s terminally ill. I don\u2019t think marijuana will be very dangerous for her.", "NTA- your wife needs to seriously re-evaluate her priorities. Your daughter needs to be as comfortable as possible right now, even the doctor recommend medical marijuana. That\u2019s absolutely worth trying, anything is worth trying to let your daughter be more comfortable. I\u2019m sorry you guys are going through this", "NTA. Marijuana is not inherently evil, and quite frankly is safer than synthetic drugs. Please don't let your wife be the decision maker in this.", "NTA. I have no other words, best regards OP, such a devastating situation.", "Let her smoke! Whatever brings her relief. Edibles can also work it just takes longer to reap the effects.

I'd be tempted to let her have *anything* that helped her through this final stage of her life.", "NTA.\n\nAt this stage of your daughter\u2019s illness and having to face her mortality at such a young age, anything that can be done to make her more comfortable physically, mentally and emotionally, is all that really matters. \n\nThe fact that the doctor suggested/endorsed it actually makes it a medication, not something recreational, so your wife is frankly bonkers for saying she would be \u201cdoing drugs\u201d. It\u2019s actually no different to all the other medications your daughter is no doubt taking to manage her pain.\n\nAnd honestly, I would not even object to it being recreational at this point, provided it was all checked with a medical professional. If it helps her relax and enjoy life a bit more that is equally as important as her pain management. \n\nI am so sorry for what you are going through and also for no doubt how much your daughter is suffering and struggling. This is a heartbreaking situation.", "Nta, your wife sounds like a nightmare. Happy for her to take harder drugs (which I think is fine in this situation) but not smoke a plant?

Relieving the child's pain is the only thing that matters.  How it happens is not a subject of discussion.  Just make it happen!", "NTA, it was suggested by her doctor. I think your wife is an asshole for freaking out about it and cruel for denying your daughter potential relief.", "YWNBTA  NTA - Your daughter's need to sleep and feel less anxious is the priority. Your wife is making a poor correlation of your daughter 'doing drugs' to using pot. Opioids and narcotics are drugs with high street value.  Please come together on this and ask your daughter what she wants to do. You love her and her time is shorter than you had ever dreamed. Best to you all.", "NTA- she deserves to be comfortable and as pain free as possible at this stage; marijuana can potentially do that for her. I don\u2019t see the harm in trying it since it was suggested by her physician. At the very least, she can try it and see how she feels. Hopefully your wife will come around to the idea", "OP I\u2019ve been in cancer treatment for two years (stage 3 breast cancer). My palliative doctor prescribed me Dronabinol, which is synthetic THC that comes in pill form. It\u2019s specifically for nausea, vomiting, and pain during cancer treatment. Your wife may have a better reaction if you suggest something that appears more like a traditional western medicine. That said, I also used gummies and tinctures during treatment and they made a big difference while giving me far fewer side effects than narcotics.", "Let her smoke!! YWBTA if you are fine with opioids for pain but draw the line at marijuana just due to outdated propaganda. \n\nSit your wife down and do some actual research together. It\u2019s your job to convince your wife for the betterment of your child. Don\u2019t let her live the last moments of her life in pain just because of some outdated views on drugs", "NTA. Please just do whatever you can legally or illegally to help your sweet girl get whatever comfort is available.", "NTA. \n\nWeed got me through cancer in a way opioids didn\u2019t and I also didn\u2019t like opioids due to my familial (both parents) history of addiction. \n\nYour daughter is dying. She deserves to do all the things she can. There\u2019s no rules for this. \n\nI am so sorry.", "I'm usually anti drugs, but gotta throw in the NTA here.  The daughter is mortally ill, the best you can do for her is alleviate her pain.", "The BIGGEST NTA I can muster.", "Your daughter is terminal, and I know you\u2019d go to the end of the earth to bring your daughter comfort. Allow her to experience and see if it brings her relief. If it doesn\u2019t, be done.", "I'm so sorry your family is going through this, it's heartbreaking. I think given her situation, developing an addiction to marijuana is the least of her concerns, and you should try whatever helps her.  YWNBTA.", "NTA, and if your wife doesn\u2019t like the suggestion of medical marijuana? Google cancer patients mushroom therapy. I\u2019m sure she will be all onboard for it considering the overwhelming positive outcomes experienced by late stage cancer patients. And those results were produced from a single dose. Don\u2019t tell big pharma", "Absolutely not the asshole, let her do what she wants and enjoy the little time she has left as best she can.", "NTA.   \nI want to tell you that I am so sorry your family is having to go through this, and my heart goes out to you. My brother died at 30 of cancer, and I snuck him weed brownies and as much cbd/thc blend edibles as I could get my hands on, even though it wasn't legal in the state he was living in. My parents were of the same mindset as your wife, and it caused a lot of difficulty with our relationship because I couldn't just sit back and not help my brother in his final months. I ended up hiding it from them in the long run, which didn't feel great, but it's a secret my brother has taken to the grave with him, and it gave him so much relief when nothing else would. Medical marijuana is well documented to help with pain and anxiety, and it's absolutely reasonable that you as a parent would do anything to make this easier on your child. You are not an asshole for wanting her to be as comfortable as possible.   \nFirst, I would ask your daughter if it's something she feels willing to try and is comfortable with the game plan. Then, I would encourage you to continue to communicate this with your wife as an option, and try providing some research to establish that this plant could be helpful for your daughter. More articles, more doctors, just more information for her to ingest and think about.  \nHer reaction could just be out of ignorance, and she could have had a knee jerk reaction when she called you an AH for considering it. I think it's totally normal to be on edge when you have a diagnosis like this in the family, and she might calm down and reconsider after letting her sit with it for a little bit. Try to not take her calling you AH personally, this is just a really hard thing for any parent to go through.   \nHopefully she comes around enough to read the research, and maybe talk to some more doctors as well. If your daughter is comfortable with this, perhaps her advocating for herself directly to your wife will help persuade her, but she may not have the willingness or energy to have this conversation with your wife if she knows she is already dead set against it. You may be the only one willing to advocate for this, but if your daughter asks you to advocate for her, just do your best.  \n I wouldn't suggest doing what I did and sneaking it past her, because you two will need to lean heavy on each other through this, and secrets will just make it harder on your relationship. But you just use your best judgement on that. \n\nIf you can get her on board...  \nI would also encourage you to try low dose medicated gummies with some CBD in them instead of smoking flower. For example, start with a half of a 5 mg 4:1 CBD to THC ratio (or even 10:1 to start out with), and go from there.  For one, flower hits harder and quicker, and can be overwhelming for someone who is not used to it. You also cannot control the dosage with flower. CBD helps counteract the psychoactive part of THC, and is helpful for anxiety as well. Ingesting allows for a slower and lower \"climb\" on the high, and has a longer lasting affects. For me, it would be comparable to taking something \"extended release\" instead of having it all hit me at once. Hopefully, using dosages and edibles will also help your wife view this as a medication, and not as a drug.   \n\n\nI wish you the best of luck, and wish your daughter and family peace and ease. <3", "You WNBTA! And I am so very sorry for your daughter's diagnosis. I cannot even comprehend how parents get through something like this. But I have friends who have lost kids from age 9 to age 20, and somehow they do. My heart goes out to you on this journey of love and grief.\n\nOn to your wife's comment - I can't understand why your wife would care one bit about your daughter \"doing drugs\" since this isn't a 15-year-old out behind the football stadium, hanging with friends, smoking dope. Anything that can help your daughter live a quality life for her remaining time here is what should be done.\n\nThe only thing I can think is that your wife is not accepting the fact that your daughter is terminal, and is still thinking in terms of some future time where she wouldn't want her daughter using drugs in \"normal\" life.", "NTA.

Before we started seeing so much more about legalization, one of the biggest pushes towards legalization or parents specifically using medicinal marijuana to ease the suffering of their terminally ill children. These kids did not get high, they just weren't in pain anymore. Why does your wife want your daughter to be comfortable only in certain ways? I mean obviously she has some hang-ups about being a terrible parent who let their kids do drugs, but that is a concern that a mother with a non-terminal teenager should have. Your daughter is not going to become an addict, she's not going to become an unrecognizable druggie, she's not going to become what your wife fears. She's just not going to be in pain. She's just going to be able to sleep. \n\nWhat is your wife afraid of? That people will find out that your daughter is doing serious end of life care? Is she worried about certain people in particular? If so, why? They are not more important than your daughter's quality of life.

She gets addicted? It literally won't matter. There is no future for it to impact. She's also already had opioids and narcotics.

She's terminal, it literally can't do any further harm, and might be a good solution to her sleep and anxiety issues.", "As someone with cancer absolutely NTA but your wife is. What exactly is she worried about? The opiates are going to have to get stronger or she'll be in incredible pain and die miserable. Better that she dies as peacefully as possible. And medical marijuana is unlikely to do much other than slightly soothe her and also help with the extreme nausea. Your wife needs to speak with hospice and palliative care counselors. She seems to be in denial about what is really going to happen. Should a normal 15 yr old be smoking pot provided by parents? Absolutely not. However a 15 yr old that is dying from painful cancer and is anxiety ridden? Does your wife realize they WILL give her strong anti anxiety meds that will make her even more out of it if she doesn't do this? At some point hospice and the hospital will even go to court to overrule your wife if it is in your daughter's best interests. I'm truly sorry for all of you. This is devastating and something I wish nobody went through  but on the scale of meds for end stage cancer medical marijuana is fairly mild. Although personally I'd get her the edibles and not smoke it. The smoke is frequently irritating.", "NTA it will definitely help her", "Definitely NTA: I would not let her smoke as it can hurt lungs for a newbie. But there is so much more out there now. Go to a good dispensary if they have them where you are at and ask questions. Edibles are amazing and you need to help,your daughter as much as possible. I am a mom and would rather my dying daughter be on marijuana than the big Pharma drugs. Let her be happy and less pain if possible. If the doctor suggested it even better.

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a bad drug AT ALL, it really helps some people, and it may be a positive thing for your daughter, but you can\u2019t know how someone will react until they try it. For me, and many other people, it sends me on an overthinking spiral and causes panic attacks. CBD is a lot safer in my opinion and has similar positive affects such as helping you sleep and pain relief", "Eh I\u2019m going in between N T A and E S H. If the doctor believes it could help your daughter during her last months on earth, then I think you should at least try it. However, I can see where your wife is coming from. Weed has been seen as the gateway drug and a bad thing for a long time, not to mention she is also losing her daughter. During hard times, people can focus on one small thing that doesn\u2019t matter as much as the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s just how the brain works. \n\nThe best thing would be have another conversation between you and your wife, look up cases where medical marijuana was used and how it helped or hindered the person using it. Then have conversations with your daughter and maybe even another conversation with the doctor.

A month ago the doctors told us it was terminal. Said she had between 6 months to a year. That was the hardest thing to ever hear, she\u2019s my only daughter and my baby. \n\nThe whole treatment plan now is pain management and just making sure my daughter is comfortable. For the last few weeks, she\u2019s been having trouble sleeping because of her pain as well as anxiety about the recent diagnosis. \n\nToday my wife and I were with our daughter at the doctor's. The doctor was just asking questions about how she was feeling both mentally and physically. Well, my daughter said the stuff I stated above and the doctor said she could always try medical marijuana since she would qualify. Since she is under the age of 18 as her parents we would have to apply as a caregiver on behalf of someone. \n\nAfter we got home my wife basically laughed at the fact the doctor suggested medical pot. I\u2019ve smoked pot occasionally throughout my life (it\u2019s legal here). I told her I think it was a good idea for our daughter if it helps her with her pain and anxiety she deserves that. Well, my wife Said I would be the biggest AH if I let our daughter do drugs. She's already been on stuff like opioids and narcotics. I don't think her smoking pot to hopefully helps her feel good.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA", "You have my sympathy for what's happening to your daughter. I think at this point, if it will help, why not let her try it?", "NTA but maybe edibles or vaping might be better as smoking might make her lungs sore, there's loads of good edibles out there and it's also pretty simple to make your own at home and that could be a fun family bonding activity. \n\nIf your wife doesn't let up you need to tell her she's being selfish and choosing to make her daughters final time on earth painful and basically neglecting her medical needs over her own outdated beliefs that's not her loving her daughter it's her being selfish and caring more about herself and \"what the neighbours might think\" etc over the reality\n\nINFO have you and your wife been to greif counselling? She might still be refusing to accept that the diagnosis is terminal nd letting her smoke might feel to her like admitting that she's not going to recover but that's still no reason for her to selfishly deny pain relief especially when a Dr brought it up", "NTA. Your wife sounds like an idiot. She needs to inform herself and not torture your terminally ill based on bs propaganda.", "NTA, let her. \n\nI am so sorry that you and your family are going through this. \n\nI know everybody thinks that they know what they would do in a situation like this but a lot of times when you're actually in that situation changes- but for what it's worth if this was my 16 year old son, I would be letting him hit the bowl as often as he needed to be comfortable and to be able to eat without nausea.", "NTA. I\u2019m so very sorry for all of you \ud83d\udc9c I highly recommend thc/cbd-n. It especially helps me sleep", "NTA. WTF is your wife thinking?", "NTA. You would be if you didn\u2019t allow your baby girl to have the least painful and anxiety reducing final months/ year of her life. I am so so sorry for what you\u2019re going through. Prayers for you and your family during this time.", "NTA. Rso is what I personally would recommend.", "NTA OP SO MUCH NTA.\nI'm SO sorry for your terrible situation. It must be really hard.\nPLEASE ADVOCATE FOR YOUR DAUGHTER", "NTA. I am very anti-recreational drug use, including pot so I can understand your wifes initial knee jerk reaction. But I would frame it to her as this is prescribed medical use and no different from the doctor prescribing narcotics. You are completely on board with no recreational use of pot by healthy children in your home; this is an extreme situation. It may also be worth looking into whether other methods of taking pot work equally well. I cannot advise on this at all but if edibles (or other methods? - my knowledge is a bit limited on this) work as well as smoking pot for cancer, your wife may be more comfortable with this. Do some research on your options and how they all work. Ultimately though, if smoking is the best method for relieving pain, your wife needs to reframe this in her mind from \"drug use\" to taking a prescribed medication. This is an awful situation all round and I am sorry you are going through it. I am reluctant to call your wife an AH as a terminally ill child is not something I would wish on anyone. Hopefully she just needs some time to think her initial, instinctive response through and reframe it in her head.", "NTA. Compromise with your wife and talk about gummies or other edibles. Your daughter is suffering. Your wife needs to think about your daughter and making her comfortable in these final months. I am so sorry for what you guys are going through. I hope you can make some amazing memories in the time you have left.", "NTA, If I found out I have 6 months to a year left, no one is going to tell me no.  I will do *whatever* I goddamn please.  (I would never do anything to intentionally harm someone else, it is a part of my ethics that I won't ever cross.)", "If my kid was dying I'd let her do fucking heroin if it made her pain better. NTA.....your wife is though.", "NTA, I don't see anything wrong with it.", "NTA", "NTA ~ your wife, however\u2026. Look, I\u2019m just gonna be blunt and if I offend anyone, well\u2026 too bad. Your daughter doesn\u2019t have long, she\u2019s dying, she\u2019s suffering,  and, as parents, your job is to do anything and everything to not let that continue. Whatever it takes, you need to make that happen for her.", "NTA. Bring your wife to someone that can educate her!", "Smoke it with her pops! Let her enjoy the high if she can. She deserves it. You deserve it too", "NTA. Is it something related to religion? Is she afraid your daughter isn't going to heaven or anything like that? \nThe highest risk about smoking MJ would be schizophrenia in a long term use. Unfortunately, that's not the issue here. It's about dignity. Your daughter deserves that. I hope you can come to an agreement.  Stay strong my friend, of course you are not the AH.", "NTA\n\nShe also doesn\u2019t have to smoke it. She can have edibles, tea, tinctures, etc etc", "Obviously NTA. I am so fucking sorry.", "NTA and you can think of it as medically prescribed cannabis instead of \u201csmoking pot\u201d.", "NTA - this isn't someone just randomly throwing it out there, this is your daughter's doctor who recommended it. Your daughter needs anything to help her manage and frankly this is worth trying if it is easily available and legal. There are many options and I think they're worth trying.\n\nYour wife is obviously grieving, but is letting her own prejudice about how pot has previously been viewed and used cloud her judgement in this.", "Let your precious daughter be as comfortable as possible in the time she has remaining. So sorry for the pain she (and your family) are experiencing. \nTotally NTA", "NTA, cannabis is \\*highly\\* recommended for cancer patients.", "First of all, I am so sorry that your daughter is dying of cancer. That is the cruelest blow of fate imaginable for a parent.\n\nPot helps with appetite, anxiety, and pain relief. Obviously you shouldn't give weed to a 15-year-old under normal circumstances, but these are not normal circumstances. See if it helps give her comfort.\n\nNTA, and my deepest condolences. This is a very hard road you are on.", "NTA\n\nAsk your daughter what effect she wants.  There are so many different types of marijuana that have been developed for different purposes.  If she just wants pain relief, there are lower THC varieties. If she wants to escape for a while, she may want a fully high experience.  Try to be clear that all options are open.\n\nConsult with your doctor and with some shops that cater to the more medicinal uses of marijuana for recommendations on variety and preparation.  In my area, there's a shop owned by one of the local Native tribes where one of the guiding principles when it was established was to provide pain relief and comfort for their elders.  Call around to find a shop with a lot of knowledge - then talk with the budtender who has the most experience with finding the right variety for medicinal use.  \n\nThen buy a variety of options and let her try different things.  I hope you find the right option to relieve her pain.\n\nI hope this can bring your daughter some comfort and that her comfort will grant you a bit as well.", "NTA. I'm so sorry; that's an incredibly difficult situation.\n\nIt sounds like your wife needs a conversation with a pain/palliative care doc, to explain why cannabis is an appropriate medication for your daughter. And then I suggest finding a dispensary that specializes in treating various issues - they are likely to have good suggestions about what strains and blends might work well for her. (Most likely primarily CBD with a little THC, but you probably already know that.)", "NTA if it alleviates any of her symptoms, why not? Even if she just likes it why not? Weed is legal here... and is a much better alternative to oppiates", "NTA your wife\u2019s reaction isn\u2019t great my friend. Why would she let her daughter not take medicine ? It\u2019s medical pot, she needs to get over herself and put the kid first. Let your daughter use pot as instructed by your doctor. Maybe sit down with your wife and try to figure out what her issue really is.", "INFO: wtf is your wife thinking??? Like, what's her reasoning?", "I am so sorry for your loss brother. My heart is breaking for you. But, she is not gone yet. Don't let your wife's preconceived notions ruin what may be a chance to make your daughter's remaining time happier and easier. \n\nMaybe something like edibles would make it more bearable for your wife. I would definitely suggest trying it if nothing else is easing things for your daughter. It helps many people. \n\nSince legalization things have become more specialized. There are edibles that give less of a \"high\" but still bring forth the anti nausea and pain relief associated with medical Marijuana. \n\nLook into it. There is no sense dismissing a valid option because some people are narrow-minded. You would absolutely NBTA in trying to find something to hell your daughter with her suffering.", "NTA, as it would improve her quality of life. But also, your wife sounds like a bad person.", "You need to ask your wife why she would object, and what the word \"drugs\" means to her.", "NTA \n\nYou and your wife need therapy to be sure you\u2019re able to centre your child in this process without hurting or exhausting each other. Your wife needs to wrap her head around the idea that what comes next is not going to be business-as-usual parenting. Cancer is stealing that. The best thing she can do for her baby now is make every day as pain-free as possible, and help her seize every opportunity for joy.\n\nMy heart is breaking for you all. I wish you every comfort and consolation that may be had.", "NTA As someone in pain who uses weed you are a hero to do it. Just ask your wife if she would do anything to make your daughter be in less pain. If she says anything other than yes leave her ass.", "NTA but your wife is opioids are way worse", "Nta pot is a great way to relieve anxiety and help her sleep.", "NAH. You clearly want your daughter to be as comfortable as possible in the little time she has left.\n\nI doubt your wife is a jerk, but I do not think she has accepted this is end of life care. She is trying to pretend your daughter is not sick. Please treat her gently and give her a couple of days to come to terms with the situation. She may be more comfortable with microdosing of edibles, so your daughter is not as high as a kite.\n\nYou and your wife will feel guilty after your daughter dies, but it will sting a little less if you know she did not suffer for your comfort.", "NTA. OP tell your wife to get educated about Marijuana, instead of regurgitating the myths and misinformation about this wonderful plant.", "An old friend of mine died from pancreatic cancer, I had brought him a ton of weed (I\u2019m in California and grow every couple seasons) and he called me the next day saying how the difference was night and day. He was on high mg of oxy, Percocet, and some other stuff but the weed is what made the difference.", "NTA and also you should let her smoke it just because it\u2019s also fun and she should get to do some wild things with her final time here. I\u2019m so sorry and wishing you all as much peace as you can find.", "Does your wife not understand that opioids are FAR more harmful than cannabis? Jfc. All the info in the world about pot helping cancer patients and yet here we are. NTA.", "NTA. Has your wife had any counseling? It sounds like she might be going through some denial, which is common in these situations. Maybe talking to someone could help her wrap her head around what\u2019s going on and make her understand that the normal concerns about kids and drugs don\u2019t apply here.", "First off, I'm sorry to hear you're going through this with your daughter.\n\nThat said, your wife's the AH here. Who laughs at a doctor's suggestion to ease their child's pain and anxiety?", "NTA. She\u2019s going to die no matter what. Who cares if she has some pot. Your wife is a bitch if she thinks it\u2019s okay to force a child to life the rest of her life in pain because she doesn\u2019t like weed.", "NTA. I am so sorry you\u2019re all going through this. I hope you make the most out of the time you have together.", "My grandma loved it when she was dying.", "Agreed, NTA\n\nI feel like the biggest concern with any drug is what the long term effects will be. In this case there, unfortunately, be a need to worry about that. Unless she has a reaction to it like an allergy if it helps her it's the here, now, day by day that matters. I'm so sorry OP.", "I think wife is still in mom-raising-daughter mode. Because what mom of a teen encourages drugs? One that's in extreme circumstances. \n\nIt's a big step to move to mom-dealing-with-pallative-care mode, and will likely take therapy and really letting the awful news sink in.", "Oh! Look at you back-tracking at full speed Friend 420! Maybe the feelings of a grieving mother should be considered and discussed WITHOUT condemnation after all, eh? (P.S. I agree with you that the daughter should be afforded ANY relief available (even fucking morphine) if it helps ease her pain, but some consideration and no name calling for those who struggle having to WATCH her die in pain, OK mate?)", "The reason young people should not smoke pot is because they still have developing brains that can be affected. \n\nThis poor girl will be gone in a year. It\u2019s doctor recommended. And hell, if it won\u2019t mess with her meds I\u2019d say let her do shots too! And make sure the medical stuff has thc!!", "This one! Please follow the doctor's recommendations and help your daughter find some relief. \n\nNTA.", "That's how I feel", "This. You\u2019re in a horrible situation OP. Allowing your daughter to do things that will help her, or even things that she just wants to do so she has had the experience, is not wrong (within reason). She deserves to have those experiences. And you deserve the memories that could come along with them.", "Thank you, that's really all she needs is enough to help her not be in pain and relax", "Yeah those definitely don't apply anymore... Honestly, I'm open to anything if it helps her pain/comfort level", "Definitely find considering her situation to take hard drugs but yeah I want her last whatever time she has left (we're hoping it's more than 6 months) to be as painless as possible the last 3 years have been painful for her both physically and mentally", "You mean YWNBTA right?", "Also, if your wife fights you on this- she is the asshole.", "The diagnosis has been difficult on our \nthe whole family and the last 3 years haven't been normal for our daughter since the original diagnosis so I know she wishes our daughter was able to do all the normal things our sons did like if one of our sons was smoking pot at 15 we would be pissed off \n\nSo the fact we\u2019ll never have the normal teen situations for our daughter is difficult to accept now I know it is for me but I also want our daughter to be comfortable", "I mean if she wanted to smoke I would let her... I don't see her wanting to though, it is legal so we have a dispensary I think for her it'll be more about the pain relief aspect of not feeling high", "This- also you and your wife may want to start therapy now. Losing a child is incredibly painful, I know first hand. You can also reach out to support groups and start forming supportive relationships with other parents. If you ever want to talk, DM and I will listen. <3", "What? I added my edit nearly immediately after posting and well before your comment? \n\nYes, my initial reaction was harsh on the mother because I cannot fathom not doing everything in my power to help my dying child. Then I sat with that for a minute and put myself in both parents shoes and was fucking heartbroken for both of them. I left my full initial statement for full transparency and because it was also honest to my gut reaction.", "Your wife just needs look at it as just another medication. It will come from a medicinal marijuana pharmacy so it will be controlled and regulated like any other medication. Opiates can have some tough side effects and make a lot of people feel really drugged up. You can also build a tolerance to them making it harder to use them to treat pain. The marijuana will be a good alternative for pain management and likely have less side effects. I\u2019ve known a number of terminal people who have used marijuana and gotten a lot of relief from it. So sorry for your family and your poor daughter. What a diagnosis to get at such a young age. Hold her tight and put her well being over any hang ups from marijuana.", "Tell your wife you\u2019d rather her think you\u2019re the biggest asshole than your daughter being in pain.", "Completely reasonable. She will be more able to enjoy herself. And it only lasts in the system for a few hours so if she doesn't like it she doesn't have to continue. I don't suggest smoking though because that can give a slight tummy ache at first and it's harder to control dosage if you don't want to be high.", "Hey OP. First of all I\u2019m beyond sorry for what you are your family are going through. A couple years ago my 11yr old cousin was diagnosed with a very aggressive brain tumor and that kid was popping edibles at the end as it was one of the only things to take the pain and anxiety down a couple notches. Now did he have the giggles and get a little inappropriate with his communication board, hells yes. But that was also when he felt good enough to be preteen ornery and I loved every minute of it and treasure those moments. Let her do whatever she needs to to get those moments in where she can. I wish you all comfort and peace as you navigate this very unwanted and undeserved journey. Hang in there!", "I wonder if some of the concern is the idea around smoking. Fortunately there are lots of other ways to ingest, which people at the medical dispensary can give further advice.\n\nI utilize medical marijuana to help with a chronic pain condition. I primarily use tinctures (1:1 CBD:THC). I like these because it's basically as medicalized as I can make it. I also have some 1:1 gummies as well. If it's not clear by how I talk about it, I never even even tried pot before starting.", "Absolutely.  Also, I see in some of your other responses you have some uncertainty about the 'high' that can be obtained from THC. As a physician, I would not minimize the potential benefit of that, in this context.  Some of these strains can really give you a good time and what's the harm in that at this point - dosing, watching a comedy, and having a belly laugh because things seem so hilarious along with a snack that is that much more delicious.    Could be a very nice time for you and your daughter, in the midst of a sea of despair.\n\nBest of luck with this. I am so sorry for it.", "This is a nightmare situation for any parent. I feel terrible for you.\n\nGive her peace and comfort as she passes this undeserving world by. \n\nI'm tearing up over here. I don't want to ever be in your shoes, but I wish only kindness and peace to you and yours.", "Thanks! Fixed it.", "Do you think that could be your wife's real issue? That maybe she's clinging to this bit of parenting normalcy because otherwise that's just another reminder/giving in of your daughter's terminal condition?", "OK, I\u2019ll leave my response up because I\u2019ll own it, but thanks for your response to me and my apologies.", "> Opiates can have some tough side effects and make a lot of people feel really drugged up.\n\nI've had to take Norco for after-surgery pain management before... I ***hated*** the way that shit made me feel.", "I mean I know she wants relief not sure about being high  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Yes, agreed. Let her get a little high and silly and giggly and snuggle her and have snacks and watch movies and laugh together and enjoy every moment possible.", "Honestly this whole situation is horrible and I feel so bad for their family. I hate that they are dealing  with this and even having these discussions. I do really hope that OP and his wife are able to come together and that she lets go of whatever fear is holding her back about some pot.", "Honestly even if she wanted to get high. At a terrible time like this, a new and maybe fun experience would be a relief from the pain and worry. \n\nIf she can, and you can manage it, take her and do things on her bucket list. Let her enjoy her time. \n\nSo sorry this is happening. \n\nNTA", "I wouldn't begrudge her getting high, either.  She's dealing with a lot, why not let her escape and feel loose for a bit? NTA", "Me too, friend.  Like I said, I\u2019m all in favor (short of voluntary/corporate/government supported suicide) ANY form of pain relief in verified terminal cases.  But I (and,  from your responses, you) can understand the emotional and mental turmoil of a grieving parent.  Hopefully, in this case, a single parent is enough to provide relief for this angel."]}
