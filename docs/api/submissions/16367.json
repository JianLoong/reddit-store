She's been at my house with other cousins many times. Every five minutes, she's coming up to me to \"tattle\" about something. She didn't like the way her cousin was dressing the Barbies. The other kids want to play with the sprinkler, but she doesn't want to. Her brother gave her other brother half of his cookie, but they were all supposed to have one. Her cousin was sitting on top of the vent. She heard her cousin flush the toilet twice, etc... over and over again. She's incredibly controlling of how other kids play and will have a full-blown meltdown if they aren't doing or saying the things she wants.

My SIL was venting to me about this and asked how anyone could find her annoying.

I said that maybe someone should've said something a while ago. I'm not trying to be mean, I'm explaining what I observed.

NTA.", "Not gonna lie your niece sounds like she could be on the specrum. Good in school but doesn't understand social norms. A lot of asperger kids are \"tattles\". Because they take everything so seriously and they see these situations as breaking the rules. A lot of them end up being bullied.\n\nNTA for trying to make your SIL see the situation form another point of view.\n\nIf your niece is stronger willed she will be fine but more likely she will need a bit of help navigating this world. The sooner your SIL gets it the better it will be for your niece.", "Soft NTA. It was harsh, but she NEEDS to know. If there's anything I remember from middle school and high school it's that snitches are THE most detested and bullied. She's going to have a very rough time, and likely no friends if she continues this.\n\nMaybe get her a pretty journal and tell her to write the \"tea\" in that instead of running around trying to get other kids in trouble. Seriously. I'm worried for her.", "NTA. Is your niece an only child? My daughter is an only child and has had some of the same issues. She's very cognisant of \"the rules\" and feels it's her duty to tell other kids off or report them to a parent or teacher if they're breaking the rules. Because she's never grown up with a co-conspirator, she's never learned how to be naughty, which sounds silly but I mean she's never learned which rules are important to follow and which ones are flexible, or how to mind her own business when she sees another kid break the rules. It's one thing to tell a teacher if little Jimmy is about to jump off the roof of the classroom onto a trampoline, but another to tell a teacher that he's colouring when it's supposed to be reading time, and she initially didn't really understand the difference.\n\nThis made her unpopular with some of the other kids and made it harder for her to make friends. It took a lot of talking and careful explaining that, if no one is being hurt or upset, that it's better to mind your own business instead of tattling on the other kids. It's a tricky message to get across as a parent because you really want to instill a \"follow the rules, do as you're told\" attitude, but an important part of growing up is learning which rules are important (and why) and which can be compromised on (and why) and that's harder as an only child, at least in my experience.\n\nEdit: also with the games etc, as an only child you don't have to learn how to compromise because the people you most often play with are your parents or other family, so if you get bored of a game or start losing or whatever you just quit and do something else. You don't have to internalise the \"I don't like this, but I have to tolerate it so someone else can enjoy it, and so we can do something I'll enjoy later\". As a parent of an only child you have to be super aware of that and actively work to instill those thoughts.", "Her mother is failing her badly, she is raising a kid who can't function.\n\nI would sit her down and have a much more serious talk. Also the father if he's around. This has been enabled for far too long.\n\nI am not a child psychologist or a teacher so I have no idea how to 'cure' her, but I suspect that some professional input is going to be needed.\n\n\nNTA And well done for having that kid's interests at heart and seeing the true sitch clearly", "NTA. Your SIL needs to know what the issues are with her daughter. Since she's rejecting your observations, though, maybe she'd do better getting her daughter therapy to help.", "NTA - Sometimes people need to be told the hard truths about their kids behaviour.\n\nThis girl may have a bright future ahead of her intellectually but socially she may struggle so it's best to get this dealt with now so she has time to adjust and learn to work better with other children.\n\nYou seem to favour this girl and enjoy her company so it wouldn't make sense you deliberately saying awful things about her... Maybe your delivery was wrong or maybe mom just doesn't want to hear it. But either way she is going to have to deal with this if she wants her daughter to succeed.\n\nThe way you describe her makes me wonder if she needs to speak with somebody, maybe a therapist or councilor... I've known children like this, they like to play by the rules and hate it when others break the rules, it really annoys them and can set them on a downward spiral. One of those children has just been diagnosed with ASD... This might be a stretch though because I can only go by what I've read.\n\nMom needs to try and take this and use it to help her daughter.", "Kid sounds like she might be neurodivergent,  so her mom is not doing her any favours. You tried to help. Which is a damne sight better that pretending everything is okay that the rest are doing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. The kid needs help and SIL is in denial. You've said your bit now it's husband's turn to lean on SIL to do the right thing for your niece.\n\nStand your ground, your niece deserves a champion.", "I mean, NTA, you handled it about as well as you could have. SIL's reaction tells me she doesn't handle criticism or adversity very well, immediately runs off to tattle and cranks everything up to 11...  sounds familiar", "NTA. Your SIL is. I wasn't there and i did not hear the wording but it seems that she can't take constructive advice. She also seems to be a proper drama queen.", "Sounds like your niece takes very much after her mother here. Who calls another parent because their child hasn\u2019t been invited to a party? That reeks of entitlement. It also sounds like your niece needs to learn some resilience surrounding loosing. From what you said about her being bright she must be used to being the best the majority of the time. Children can often struggle emotionally with getting things wrong or loosing, learning how to self regulate during these times is a life lesson.", "NTA kid's gotta grow out of it. And frankly just based on how you've described her it's possible that she's neurodivergent and just doesn't have the same understanding of social cues and rhythms but that's besides the point. You were being honest and speaking from a place of concern, especially since it's pretty clear that you do want the best for your niece.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
