Americans will say you need to charge your children rent, Eastern Europeans will say you shouldn't. So I think your \"final judgment\" will depend a lot on where most commenters are from.\n\nWhere I'm from, decent parents don't charge their children rent. None of my friends coming from good families were charged rent. I only know of one person who charged her children rent and guess their relationship... they don't have a close one. It sends the wrong message.\n\nI also don't agree with parents trying to \"parent\" an adult child. If they have a problem with their child living with them, they need to straight up tell that to their children instead of trying to live off on them. Contributing to utilities vs paying actual rent to a parent are very different things.\n\nYour ex's partner just doesn't like your son and wants to \"teach lessons\" to a literal adult he's not even related to.", "NTA, i find it ridiculous that your ex thinks it was suspicious that your son was able to pay the $1k. She knows $1k is too much for him yet she and her husband still decided to charge him that amount. She\u2019s set your son for failure.", "Nta   my dad has saved my ass on rent many times.  Without him I wouldn't be where I am in life.\n\n\n\nLong story short back your son and let him Live his life.", "NTA\n\nHow is it undermining her parenting? He's paying the rent, just not how *she* wants, because now he can save up and move out. Then she won't have extra play money. You could also state, he is paying rent with his money and you're giving him an allowance to do what he wants. \n\nI never charged my sons rent, I wanted them to be able to save up and move out on their own.", "NTA. I think the idea of charging your child to live with you when it\u2019s really not costing you any extra since you\u2019re paying the mortgage anyways is ridiculous. Obviously some exceptions, like if it\u2019s a household that\u2019s struggling and he\u2019s an adult, then sure, he should help out. Or if he was like over 30 maybe. But 22 is still pretty young. Is he going to college or working full-time? \n\nAs a parent I would think you\u2019d want to help them get a little bit of a pad of savings so that they could move out sooner and make it on their own, which should be the ultimate goal. Plus, our time on earth is limited so as long as he\u2019s not a deadbeat or like super messy or hard to live with, she SHOULD be seeing it as a positive that she gets a little more time with her son because eventually that will go away. Instead she\u2019s basically punishing him for his presence. And on top of that, they don\u2019t even need the money. Definitely NTA, she never said HOW it has to be paid and you, like a good parent, are trying to HELP your kid instead of making life harder than it already is with the rising cost of everything these days.\n\nAlternatively, could he just live with you rent-free instead while he saves? It\u2019s not like she and her new husband seem to want him there anyways\u2026", "NTA\n\n> She thought it was suspicious that he was able to pay them the 1K without complaint \n\n1k sounds suspiciously high, especially if she expected him to struggle. At that rate I seriously doubt it\u2019s about covering his share of utilities.\n\nAt 22 the time for parenting is over; he is a young adult. As the two of you are no longer married, how you spend your money is not her concern. \n\nAnd Tom has no business trying to parent your adult son at all.", "NTA. I\u2019m from America and I get everyone opinions on this subject differ. That being said. The only time your adult child should contribute financially is if they themselves can afford to. That him continue to live there puts a financial strain on the family and any money he can provide would help. Or if he\u2019s a deadbeat adult. Which none of this sounds like. I get London can get a bit expensive but your ex isn\u2019t struggling. Honestly if your gonna help your son in rent then it\u2019s better to help him find a place on his own. Maybe get a flat-mate or like you stated moving in to a flat with his gf. Go over with your son on his financials and figure out money. Sounds like living with his mom is gonna get very annoying. Specially since it seems like ex\u2019s husband doesn\u2019t really want son there or it was what was done to him and he feels like it will make your son a \u201cman\u201d. Either way best to help him get on his own sooner then later if it\u2019s possible.", "NTA, but you are a complete mug handing over 1k a month of your money to your ex and her new squeeze.  \n\nIt seems to me that if they are charging him 1k a month it\u2019s because they want rid. What\u2019s funny is that you are sabotaging that.", "NTA, but I would tell her if she has a problem with it she can pay you back.", "NTA fuck your ex she can shut the fuck up. He\u2019s an adult. If you decide to pay it for him why should her greedy ass care", "What is an average rent in London for those of us in the US who have  no idea.?", "NTA.  Your son isn't a child yet she is parenting him like a child.  Also why is the stepdad involved with parenting?    \n\n\nAlso it seems like 1000 pounds for one bedroom is quite high?  I don't know how much flats are in London.  Can you just pay for university housing instead?", "Damn, 1k isn't much for London. Outside of mommys home he surely would struggle to find something that cheap outside of Shepards Bush.", "ESH your son is old enough to pay digs however \u00a31000 is excessive. You going behind your ex\u2019s back and not talking to her about this is where you ultimately went wrong here. I don\u2019t think you should be covering his rent tbh. He learns nothing from living rent free as an adult- all be it well meaning. If you had supported him to actually move out etc then fine but he should still be the one to cover majority of costs- he is an adult at the end of the day.", "NTA and at this point Ed\u2019s a legal adult so any agreements you legally  had would have expired.

It really sounds like they wanted to force him out which they could have done in a better way.\n\nI'm dirt poor in comparison and I still wouldn't charge my child rent, if they are working they take on more if not all of their own personal expenses and nominal amounts for food. My home would cost more or less the same if they were not living there.\n\nWhen my brother turned 16 and had a measly \u00a320pw of college bursary my parents demanded all of it.

Here's your friendly internet stranger's opinion. I don't think you should undermine your ex. That being said, charging \u00a31000 when he could get a flat for \u00a31200 seems excessive.

Not make a profit from them.", "NTA OP,  I think that amount is crazy amount.\n\nI agree with this poster, I also find it strange that people charge their kids this amount at such a young age. \n\nWhen my brother and I lived with our separated parents, me with my mum and bro with my dad, we paid what is called digs so much a month to help out. However, it was never 1k a month. \n\nThere are other ways to teach our kids to stand on their own two feet that don't involve asking for 1k out of them. Sounds to me as though the OP even thinks it's crazy amount and he is helping his kid to be responsible and still pay but he ain't making his son scrape by because all his money ends up going to his mother and stepfather.", "I can tell you right now, I would have been happier not paying anything! Lol. \n\nI am the same age now, as my parents were when I graduated.  As I have aged, I have really grown to appreciate their wisdom.\n\n They weren't mean about it. But they were upfront.

They need to understand finances, be able to cook, interact socially with people who are not their peers etc. \n\nCharging them a small rent so they understand the concept is quite different than them paying half your mortgage or more. They should have enough to save something and have some money for fun or they won't see any point in working at all.", "Interesting take. \n\nI believe that there are different ways to learn to manage resources without it being about rent. I see what you mean though and do agree that some people do become entitled however I also feel that comes from other areas within their parenting they lacked.", "Here if you go off to university after high school, you're learning to budget and manage resources by default because what you have to live on as an university student is pretty low.\n\nBut if someone is going into a trade or a job after trade school or high school, they're pretty much thrown into adult life instantly and have to learn.\n\nI don't see how parents would be the ones teaching about these things at that point. As soon as someone gets a job, they're buying their own food and whatever else they can afford, and if they're planning to move out, they're saving up for that or for a car for work, etc.\n\nDefinitely not everyone has moved out where I'm from due to finances or so they could help their parents but in these cases I'm sure they agree on the finances. In my \nfamily also there are multi-generation families living together and they consider themselves a unit and the \"child\" will inherit the family home so they work together with bills. \n\nDecent parents here want to help their children succeed and be able to buy property instead of charging them for rent. The salaries are also lower in general and renting with an average income is not ideal\u2014you can't really save up much, and parents want you to be able to save.\n\nAlso for a lot of people here the family home is the place where you can go back to to recover if things don't work out (bad relationship, out of work, retraining, etc.) so if you put the \"give me half of your salary as soon as you step into this house\" it really takes away that feeling of love and security you would have otherwise.", "I agree.

Maybe on Reddit it seems a lot,  but it must just be the demographics of the people on Reddit.  It is not a common thing to charge one\u2019s child a fee to continue to live with them.  You may see when a parent is lower income and struggles to make it, that rent is charged.  \n\nI personally only know 2 families that charged rent. In each case they saved the $$ for the use of the child.  First case, they charged the daughter, SIL, and child, about 30% of what they would pay for rent on their own. No extra for food or utilities so really a small fraction of what their life would cost.  The parents banked it and gave it back to the daughter as a down payment for a house.  2nd case after paying the fees for their sons college, he changed his mind on moving day and decided to get a job instead.  He earned terrible wages in a factory but since he lived at home and only paid his car payment, he had more disposable income than they did.  They worked up a cost of his life alone and showed him he could not afford to live if not for his free life at home.  They they then started charging him a fraction of that amount and saved it in a future college account for him.  So later he would not have the excuse of not being about to afford college.  \n\nSo no, Americans do not generally charge rent to their adult children.", "I can see charging some money after they are established adults and done with schooling. But it would always be as little as was actually needed for the healthy operation of the household. Use it to pay for new appliances, repairs, utilities ECT. And again make sure it's entirely affordable and deeply discounted. That I'd be OK with. Seems fair. But full rent? Why not just kick them out at that point, you obviously don't like your kids...", "> He isn't a child anymore\n\nRight so people can stuff their lessons where they belong", "My dad charged us rent if we went back home after uni, a middling amount.
