Now my niece is getting married and we all have to bring a dish like potluck. That's tacky.", "Nta did your sister fail maths in school?", "NTA - she has a plus one. It is up to her to choose her plus one and it has nothing to do with the busy and generous couple to be. I\u2019d bet she told her BF that she didn\u2019t get a plus one because she will have more fun with her friend.", "You gave her a +1 not a +2\n\nNTA", "NTA - she asked for a swap and you gave it to her. She can figure out that situation on her own. She can not expect you to give up space because she doesn\u2019t have her shit together", "Yeah that seems like a really easy fix for gf sister. I can't imagine the friend wouldn't understand the change in plans."]}
