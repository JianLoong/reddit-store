We have a 2 year old together and we're expecting baby number two. My relationship with Kayden's brother and SIL has never been great. She got really weird around me pretty quickly and things soured from there. Kayden told me his SIL was jealous of the fact I hit it off so well with his mom and sister, but especially his sister and that his brother had always kind of followed his SILs lead. Seems his SIL was around the family since she was a kid and she and my BIL have been together since high school. She always thought she would be like the second daughter for the family but SIL and her have always clashed a little and were never tight.\n\nKayden has been great about standing up for me when needed and he has shut down his SIL on more than one occasion when she was being rude.\n\nOne of the things that has resulted from all this is Kayden's SIL insisted I will never be her children's aunt. They have specifically been told I am not their aunt and they are not to call me Aunt Emmy. I have been kept at a distance from the kids during family gatherings and generally SIL will ensure I don't interact with her kids. Kayden sees them less as a result because he refuses to have me leave our home so they can visit, something his SIL tried to insist on.\n\nMy relationship with SIL is the best though and we are close. She has a child the same age as mine and she will come over and we hang out with our toddlers. Since she's here so often I will often have enough food for both kiddos. She has picked up some inspo from me on how to introduce food to toddlers since she said her kiddo eats better since they started hanging out with us. She mentioned it at a family dinner recently because her parents commented how much better her kiddo was eating too and the different plate she used. She said it was all thanks to me and was saying how she really owed me one.\n\nKayden's SIL asked why she hangs out with me so much and never spends time with her. It brought up some of the underlying issues simmering around between us. She then asked why I never do that for her kids and why I'm not sharing my vast knowledge with her. Kayden jumped in and said she has made her feelings clear about me and has ordered me to stay away from her kids so how am I supposed to do any of that with her or them.\n\nThe very next day she asked if the kids could come over for lunch and I said no. She asked about some other day and I said no again. She then told me I was an ass and excluding her kids. I told Kayden what happened and he talked to his brother, or more like fought with him.\n\nI do feel kinda bad for the kids and would love to get to know them better but I don't trust their parents in any of this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696692389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1728zzt/aita_for_refusing_to_feed_my_husbands_nieces_and/", "score": 2846, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or she\u2019d drop them off and disappear for the day. She wants a free babysitter and free food for her kids.  \n\n\nGood for you and husband putting a stop to it ever starting.

If you aren't \"family\" and aren't \"Aunt Emmy,\" and the kids have been instructed as such, she needs to mend bridges with you - over a period of time and in good faith. Demanding something and then being angry you refused, shows that she's not ready to do that. I would not capitulate to her demands until she actually shows that she/they would like to fix the relationship. You are correct not to trust the parents, and with her deep seated animosity, it would be dangerous for you to include them. It's unfortunate that her children are reaping what she sowed, but it's actions and consequences.", "NTA\n\nBeing alone with the children of someone who hates you is a risk you should not take. You have your own family to think about.

Now all of a sudden she sees an advantage to her in you sharing your knowledge and skill and she comes to you entitled and demanding with zero apologies for her past behavior.

Why would you have them over, since you're not their aunt, according to her.  She can't have it both ways.  She's been a royal jerk to you, but she wants in on what you and other SIL have.  I thinks not.  She did this to herself.", "NTA. she excluded *you* and then expects you to treat her the same way you treat your SIL. i\u2019m so happy you and Kayden stand your grounds against her together when these conflicts arise. she doesn\u2019t deserve anything from either of you if she\u2019ll continue to pretend you guys aren\u2019t family and be hostile", "NTA.

But how you could read that post and judge OP as Y T A is beyond me (and everyone else). She's unequivocally NTA in this situation. Period.

She could. ***But why in Hell should SHE be \"the bigger person\" here?*** Based solely on what she's told us, she's the one who's being mistreated here. For SIL to specifically tell her kids to **never** call OP their aunt, to have tried to get OP **to leave her own fucking home** so that the kids could visit with their uncle, OP's husband, to make so much effort to keep OP from having *any* kind of relationship with her own niece(s) and nephew(s) is so OUTRAGEOUS...... I have no words. It's stunning. Just absolutely stunning.\n\nWhy do you and others always encourage the person being mistreated to *be the bigger person* in these situations? No. Just...... NO. *That* is SIL's duty and it's perfectly fine - and, as far as I'm concerned, preferable - for OP to set that boundary and tell SIL she has some work to do if she thinks OP is just going to take orders from her. And please don't argue that OP is being petty or that if *she's* not the one making change then change isn't possible. That's all complete BS in this case. SIL doesn't get to blatantly treat OP like shit for *years* and then decide that now that she wants something from her, OP should just jump up and start tap dancing for her. \n\nCan this relationship be repaired? Can OP have an opportunity to get to know her niece(s) and nephew(s)? Can the cousins all be closer because the parents have resolved their issues? Of course! And I hope it happens, too.

She has made it quite clear that she doesn't want you around her kids, so she can't just turn around and act surprised when you treat your SIL/SIL's kids differently than you treat Kayden's SIL (man that was confusing to type).", "This is the most confusing story I\u2019ve ever read! I had to stop because it was giving me a headache. Who the f is who? SIL or SIL or ??", "Dang people\u2019s families are so F\u2019d up. \n\nHow do these people exist?\n\nNTA\n\nYou\u2019re dead to her until she wants something from you. Typical.", "Question - Is she trying to extend an olive branch and bring her kids or just trying to dump the kids on you?", "Again. Feeling sorry for these kids. Where are the adults.", "**NTA**   This is not about feeding children, it's about fostering extended family bonds.   Kayden's SIL has been consistent in her position that you are not family to her kids.   She's been excluding you for their entire lives, why would she think she can send them to your house for lunch?    Her attitude towards you has had expected consequences.", "NTA. But you are playing a role in perpetuating the cycle.", "NTA. SHE EXCLUDED HER OWN KIDS! She saw that yiu & other SIL were buddy-buddy & wants to be included now. Guess she thought yiu would be begging for her forgiveness and kids, or just wanted to be a bulky, HA!! Didn't work & now she sees your relationship with other SIL is of mutual benefit & enjoyment  & feels a way, lol", "NTA but you are indeed not those children\u2019s aunt, you are their uncle\u2019s wife. A true aunt is a blood relation. In the same sense, she is not your SIL, she is your BIL\u2019s wife", "NTA and don't allow her to use her kids to manipulate you.", "Unless she has sincerely apologized and been trying hard to make amends and be respectful and kind to you, and I've read the comments below, so I'm aware she has done none of that, you absolutely aren't an asshole. She's manipulative, and likely some kind of narcissist. I feel bad for her kids, and to some extent husband. Loving someone like that is draining, and while his actions are equally inexcusable, he's likely just as much a victim of her childish, petty behavior as the rest of you, and he doesn't even know it.", "NTA. What a crazy situation. Ignore that whole side of the family. Not worth the emotional blackmailing.", "NTA Kayden's sil wants to have her cake and eat it too.", "Yeah no. It was a gift she wanter to stay away for so long. Keep that up. Dont be a doormat. She doesnt decide when and how she spends time with you. Nta. Tell her you dont forgive her.", "NTA\n\nSIL has made her bed but doesn't want to lie in it. Well that's so sad for her that I just had to get out my tiny violin.", "NTA at all OP.\n\nI have to say it because I haven\u2019t seen anyone say it yet, what exactly does she think she\u2019s going to accomplish with all this hostility? Does she think she\u2019s going to endear herself to the in laws by acting hostile towards you and telling her children you ARE NOT their aunt? If she were MY daughter in law I\u2019d keep her at a distance too.  There are healthy ways to deal with jealousy and boy is she missing the mark. There\u2019s also right ways to bond with family and if she thinks she\u2019ll become like a family\u2019s second daughter with this hostility\u2026 well, she stands to lose the most.\n\nI think Kayden needs to get involved and explain to her your terms and conditions regarding mending fences.  If and only if you\u2019re willing to.", "NTA\n\nDon't let those people into your home. They sound like nothing but trouble.", "Those poor kids. Invite the kids for bdays and movie nights with their little cousin. But don\u2019t put your neck out for their parents. The brother\u2019s wife is a walking personality disorder unlikely to seek treatment, keep at distance.", "NTA. SIL is not nice.    If you want to get to know the kids,  You could meet on neutral ground, at MIL's,  for instance.  I would put all steps to restitution on SIL.  She started it, she has to earn her way back. I am sorry she is so toxic.", "Nah , she\u2019s nuts. Wants you to leave the house so she can visit one minute and wants to bring her kids for you to feed next?  Keep clear of this one. NTA", "what\u2019s wrong with the name kayden lmao", "i mean the bridge was already burned and OP didn\u2019t light the match. SIL got butthurt and petty and completely excluded OP from her kids\u2019 lives, the only reason she\u2019s \u2018trying for a better relationship\u2019 out of the blue after all these years is to either benefit herself by having OP get her kids to eat, or benefit herself by trying to get on the other SIL\u2019s good side. OP is just being used \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Nah sil an ass just for being so entitled.", "And what does she have to gain from this?  Absolutely nothing but more drama if she let's this lady in.  Not everyone deserves forgiveness.  It doesn't make everything better.", "I don't believe she is coming around, which is why I said no.", "Of course! Here's what I like and what I do regarding feeding my kiddo.\n\nSo firstly, we love the divided plates and we have some in different sized divisions depending on what meal it is and what we offer. That's a huge thing that I think helps the littles especially. I also think it's a great way to see what kids really love and what they like and what they maybe aren't too fond of.\r  \n\r  \nI am conscious not to put too much food on the plate for littles. It can be a little daunting for some and can make them eat less if there looks like too much.\r  \n\r  \nI like to offer a variety of different things. Sometimes it means they don't get a complete meal as my husband and I would eat. But it would all be nutritious and allows them to experiment nicely.\r  \n\r  \nI like to offer healthy snacks when hungry.\r  \n\r  \nI don't stress how much they eat off their plate. So if we only take a few bites of stuff that's no big deal. They won't always be as hungry today as they were yesterday, etc.\r  \n\r  \nI also keep in mind foods they love. I always offer at least one to two things they love with some new stuff and/or stuff that maybe wasn't loved before.\r  \n\r  \nI also cut stuff up into small pieces for them so they don't play with it much.\r  \n\r  \nThese are things I have found work really well for us. Our kiddo eats really well and SILs kiddo has definitely improved since this stuff was started with them.", "I responded to someone else so I'll just share that comment here as well!\n\nSo firstly, we love the divided plates and we have some in different sized divisions depending on what meal it is and what we offer.

But she has actively taught them that I am not their aunt. They have been told time after time I am not part of their family and we are in no way aunt and niblings.", "Well, she tried to get me to leave. My husband said no way to that and stuck to it.\n\nBut yes, it has made family gatherings very awkward and uncomfortable. My husband's sister particularly hates it because she knows our relationship came into why his SIL is like this toward me (or at least the reason they believe). She didn't like her that much before but now she can't stand her and my husband's parents are sad because they got along with her before this but they don't like her behavior.", "Personally, I don't think she had a lightbulb moment at all.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

So she really latched onto his sister and wanted them to be super close and be like sisters. But his sister didn't like her that much.", "I don't believe it's an olive branch and neither does my husband.", "Kayden believes she was trying to chase me off or maybe get me to stop interacting with his sister the way I was. His SIL and mom had a good relationship so it's not like she didn't get along with any of his family before.", "They have been invited but they are never allowed to come. Once she asked my husband if he would make me leave to have them there and he said no so they didn't come.", "NTH\n\nShe'd definitely need to prove to you that she's sorry for the way she treated you in the past, and start to really show you with tangible, honest, actions. \n\nAnd give you the time needed to actually get to trust her. \n\nOtherwise, your reaction is totally warranted, and I *do* understand that you feel bad for those kids (it's not their fault they have a sh*tty mother).\n\nI hope she'll at least learn to be less jealous, and stop denying her kids the insight you could provide in their life by actually accepting you in the family.", "She seems like a miserable person. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good reason why Kayden\u2019s sister doesn\u2019t like her and why she is not welcomed by the family.", "I'm envisioning that old sitcom Dinosaurs and SIL's kids yelling \"NOT the Auntie!\" at OP.", "I would answer they can come when they call me Aunt, and then you make sure your hubby's SIL is there, so only invite her kids when the other cousin is there too.", "Anyone can apologize and not mean it. \n\nYour husband told her exactly what the problom is,  yet she takes no responsibility,  and lashes out at you yet again. \n\nShe hates you. She is indoctrinating her kids to not like you and that you aren't family. \n\nShe's been like this for years, its ingrained in her. It'll take time if she truly wants to change. \n\nYou have a great husband, he's protective of you and his family.", "Yep! All this ^^\nAlso once you know what they love, stagger it so that new offerings that they\u2019re a bit iffy about come out first when they\u2019re starving. They\u2019ll be more inclined to nibble at it than after they\u2019ve filled their bellies on their favourite foods. For example fried potato always come out last in our house (if it comes out at all). That way a big amount of greens get eaten first.", "Eventually he may get sick of her nonsense. The kids stand to lose the most.  You have cousins who get to grow up together while hers are on the periphery.", "Righteously indignant?! Seriously?? She\u2019s treated poorly by this woman for years and years. Sil never apologized or even acknowledged her terrible behavior. But you want her to just forget about all past behaviors? You teach people how to treat you. If OP acquiesced, she would be teaching sil she can be as nasty and insecure and blame it all on OP and when sil decides to ask for free food and babysitting OP\u2018s supposed to do what? Say sure, you\u2019ve told your kids I\u2019m not their aunt and not to associate with me, but yeah, I\u2019ll be a doormat and give you what you want.", "So what would be an appropriate first step? Was she an ass? Absolutely? Was she potentially seeing something they could take first steps to bond over? We won't know will we?", "Yes! I have heard a lot of this can be great for kids with any food aversions.", "Same race as them.

I\u2019m def gonna use that intersection comment all the time now!!! Thanks\ud83d\ude0a", "Yes she could be a doormat and tell sil that she can treat her like dirt for years and OP will just forget about it when it\u2019s convenient for sil.", "The first step should be sil apologizing for throwing her insecurities into OP and treating her so poorly.", "Rewarding shitty behavior is not the answer. Nibblings? sure. Sil? Pound dirt.", "It doesn't matter whether SIL warrants anything from the OP. It's totally about what the OP and her DH want. OP said she wanted them to have a relationship with the niblings. This would have been a way to do that.   OP's DH would likely want to have some relationship with his sister. This would have been a way to move toward that.\n\nAnd who knows. Maybe they'd have the niblings over, and it really was for some nefarious reason of the SIL (Free food! Free babysitter!)  But maybe not. Maybe this would be the first step in turning around the relationship with SIL.", "It does matter, though. Because the opportunity is already tainted by SIL\u2019s opportunism."]}
