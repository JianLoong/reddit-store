We have a 2 year old together and we're expecting baby number two. My relationship with Kayden's brother and SIL has never been great. She got really weird around me pretty quickly and things soured from there. Kayden told me his SIL was jealous of the fact I hit it off so well with his mom and sister, but especially his sister and that his brother had always kind of followed his SILs lead. Seems his SIL was around the family since she was a kid and she and my BIL have been together since high school. She always thought she would be like the second daughter for the family but SIL and her have always clashed a little and were never tight.\n\nKayden has been great about standing up for me when needed and he has shut down his SIL on more than one occasion when she was being rude.\n\nOne of the things that has resulted from all this is Kayden's SIL insisted I will never be her children's aunt. They have specifically been told I am not their aunt and they are not to call me Aunt Emmy. I have been kept at a distance from the kids during family gatherings and generally SIL will ensure I don't interact with her kids. Kayden sees them less as a result because he refuses to have me leave our home so they can visit, something his SIL tried to insist on.\n\nMy relationship with SIL is the best though and we are close. She has a child the same age as mine and she will come over and we hang out with our toddlers. Since she's here so often I will often have enough food for both kiddos. She has picked up some inspo from me on how to introduce food to toddlers since she said her kiddo eats better since they started hanging out with us. She mentioned it at a family dinner recently because her parents commented how much better her kiddo was eating too and the different plate she used. She said it was all thanks to me and was saying how she really owed me one.\n\nKayden's SIL asked why she hangs out with me so much and never spends time with her. It brought up some of the underlying issues simmering around between us. She then asked why I never do that for her kids and why I'm not sharing my vast knowledge with her. Kayden jumped in and said she has made her feelings clear about me and has ordered me to stay away from her kids so how am I supposed to do any of that with her or them.\n\nThe very next day she asked if the kids could come over for lunch and I said no. She asked about some other day and I said no again. She then told me I was an ass and excluding her kids. I told Kayden what happened and he talked to his brother, or more like fought with him.\n\nI do feel kinda bad for the kids and would love to get to know them better but I don't trust their parents in any of this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696692389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1728zzt/aita_for_refusing_to_feed_my_husbands_nieces_and/", "score": 653, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or she\u2019d drop them off and disappear for the day. She wants a free babysitter and free food for her kids.  \n\n\nGood for you and husband putting a stop to it ever starting.

If you aren't \"family\" and aren't \"Aunt Emmy,\" and the kids have been instructed as such, she needs to mend bridges with you - over a period of time and in good faith. Demanding something and then being angry you refused, shows that she's not ready to do that. I would not capitulate to her demands until she actually shows that she/they would like to fix the relationship. You are correct not to trust the parents, and with her deep seated animosity, it would be dangerous for you to include them. It's unfortunate that her children are reaping what she sowed, but it's actions and consequences.", "NTA\n\nBeing alone with the children of someone who hates you is a risk you should not take.

Now all of a sudden she sees an advantage to her in you sharing your knowledge and skill and she comes to you entitled and demanding with zero apologies for her past behavior.

Why would you have them over, since you're not their aunt, according to her.  She can't have it both ways.  She's been a royal jerk to you, but she wants in on what you and other SIL have.  I thinks not.  She did this to herself.", "NTA. she excluded *you* and then expects you to treat her the same way you treat your SIL. i\u2019m so happy you and Kayden stand your grounds against her together when these conflicts arise. she doesn\u2019t deserve anything from either of you if she\u2019ll continue to pretend you guys aren\u2019t family and be hostile", "NTA.

And you\u2019re absolutely right on her looking for free babysitting.", "Not only that, I can imagine her trying to make SIL her best friend and then \u2019mean girl\u2019 exclude you.", "[removed]", "reading  stuff like this makes me so glad i do not have any living relatives.  too much drama for me. howeveri wouldnt feed someone elses kids tell the parents to send food they like. cause you are now eating wet dogfood on crackers.or cat food.or make my special dip. 1 can of shredded cat food in gravey.some minced onions. some mayo. and serve it. i did that a few times to people who invited themselves over in the summer with out a invite to have a bbq and use my pool .. they loved the dip thier kids ate it all. but i had more cans of cat food.", "There has been zero apology and the kids do not call me Aunt Emmy and it has not been mentioned as a possibility.", "I came in with the same question. Until SIL makes a sincere apology and allows OP to be an actual aunt to the kids, there should be no meals or visits to OP's home.\n\nETA: NTA", "Yep. She can apologize and fix this with the kids, or she can take a hike.", "but only if she apologizes for everything and admits she was wrong for alienating op and her husband all these years and driving a wedge in the family which will never happen.", "I agree with this! My first thought was that it's a trap to put OP in a bad light with the family. Like, not telling OP about an allergy or accusing OP of doing something dangerous or inappropriate. Nope, no way.\n\neta: I spend way too much time on this sub lol!", "And babysitting, too, I'm sure.", "So firstly, we love the divided plates and we have some in different sized divisions depending on what meal it is and what we offer. That's a huge thing that I think helps the littles especially. I also think it's a great way to see what kids really love and what they like and what they maybe aren't too fond of.\n\nI am conscious not to put too much food on the plate for littles. It can be a little daunting for some and can make them eat less if there looks like too much.\n\nI like to offer a variety of different things. Sometimes it means they don't get a complete meal as my husband and I would eat. But it would all be nutritious and allows them to experiment nicely.\n\nI like to offer healthy snacks when hungry.\n\nI don't stress how much they eat off their plate. So if we only take a few bites of stuff that's no big deal. They won't always be as hungry today as they were yesterday, etc.  \n\nI also keep in mind foods they love. I always offer at least one to two things they love with some new stuff and/or stuff that maybe wasn't loved before.\n\nI also cut stuff up into small pieces for them so they don't play with it much.\n\nThese are things I have found work really well for us. Our kiddo eats really well and SILs kiddo has definitely improved since this stuff was started with them.", "Maturing? In a couple days time after years of nasty attitude towards OP? Not likely...", "I don't think she's maturing based on her reaction the day before asking me. It seems like the hostility is still very present, not to mention the jealousy. I'm not sure if there will ever be that kind of maturing on her part.", "This isn\u2019t maturing. This is her wanting something. That\u2019s it. \n\nOp: NTA.", "Leopards do not change their spots", "Yes, she didn't want me around her kids or her so she expected me to leave my home for them to visit.", "Yep. I don\u2019t know who the other SIL is. I need names to keep these people straight.", "Two SILs? I was lost too.", "It is extreme but my husband said it's all fueled by her jealousy. He said it's like she worries her kids will be close to me and she'd have to hear about me more or something. He knows her far better than I do so I trust him. I never got the chance to know the person he knew before I came into the picture.", "My relationship with my SIL is great but not with my husband's SIL.", "Might not be safe for OP to have the kids over. Who knows what their mum could accuse OP of?\n\nBetter to interact with them at MIL's place.\n\nEdited.\n\nEdit 2: Plus any interactions with the kids will bring their mum into OP's orbit. Better to use a neutral location aka MIL's house.", "Opportunity to get to know them?? SIL just wants free meals and a babysitter for her kids. She didn't apologize for her behaviour, didn't try to mend the relationship and didn't say the kids could call OP aunt or even look at her as such. \nEverything would stay the same, except op would be feeding SIL's kids. \nThat's not how you build a relationship with someone.", "What olive branch? SIL is trying to take advantage of her. People do not have to \\~be the better person\\~ when they've been badmouthed for years. This is bad advice.", "I get your point, but it doesn't sound like SIL was offering an olive branch, it sounds like she was trying to use OP for her skill with kids nutrition. She didn't ask her to meet up for a coffee and talk, sort out their differences, she just asked to bring her kids round for lunch, right after finding out she helped other SIL's kid eat better.", "What olive branch, that was the SIL trying to take advantage of OP and save face in front of in law's that have never liked her.", "An olive branch would be apologizing and saying she wants to start over.", "That would depend on how spiteful she could get. It could cost me a lot if she was vindictive enough to accuse me of mistreating her kids. Could have cost me a lot of stress if she talked shit to me the whole time and was rude. Not to mention she could tell her kids not to listen to me and given we don't know each other well because of her, that could have been a huge struggle dealing with five kids on top of being pregnant.", "This is a terrible take\n\nOp does not have to be kind and do labour for someone who is outright shitty to her face. How absurd to call her the asshole here. Good lord.", "That made me laugh because I know my husband and another Kayden I went to school with. A few have definitely hit adulthood!", "I think he just goes along with her. My husband was surprised his brother would be okay with her acting like that but then he also thought about it and said he always adored her so she could probably get away with a lot more than she should.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

These people decided they loath you for whatever reason that seems not to have been in your control.  Now that you can offer her something she wants to just byegone all that behavior?\n\nFor your own mental health, I'd consider telling them to fuck off and to keep your name out their mouths.

And I am glad someone else asked, as I was about to", "Agreed", "Doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s maturing. More like trying to use you. If she were maturing the first step would be to establish a relationship with you first.", "It does sound like that, you could try to test the water, suggest the 3 of you SIL's all go to her house with the kiddos to show you would like a relationship with the kids but that she can't use you. That way she can't play the victim and act like you're excluding her kids because she didn't warm up to you instantly (I 100% agree with how you handled yourself so far, I'm just saying some people are very good at playing the victim and you don't want to allow her to sour your relationship with others)", "It could be an opportunity to connect yourselves and the cousins though\u2026", "Oh, hell no.
