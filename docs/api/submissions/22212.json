{"id": 22212, "submission_id": "14zhjk3", "title": "AITA for altering inherited jewelry so I can wear it?", "selftext": "Last year, I (31F) received some jewelry from a relative who passed away. I have a small collection of vintage and modern jewelry I have collected over the years, and work adjacent to the industry, so once the family had sorted out the major pieces, my aunt thought I would like to have the rest and gave it to me. There were no stipulations, just \"this looked like something you may like\". Most of the things in the box were junk, but I did end up with three necklaces, a bracelet, two rings, and a very nice long strand of glass pearls.\n\nI took some of the better pieces to a jeweler friend of mine, who said at most one of the rings could be worth about $300, but the rest were all mid-range costume. He cleaned them up for me, and fixed a few pieces, including taking a piece out of the bracelet to make it fit and to fix a broken clasp, and adding some solder beads to the ring that was too big. The silk cord on the glass pearls was worn out, so I cut the strand and reknotted them into a more wearable piece. The ring and the bracelet have become everyday pieces for me, and I frequently wear the pearls for \"fancy\" dress.\n\nA month ago, my mom and I went out to lunch with her sisters, including the aunt who gave me the jewelry. She immediately noticed I was wearing some, so I told her a little bit about what my friend had told me, and showed her how he fixed them. I also showed her a picture of me wearing the pearls. My other aunt, who had been listening, immediately asked me what gave me the right to alter heirloom jewelry. I told her I wasn't aware that any of the pieces were heirlooms, and that since most of the family had already gone though it by the time I got it, I thought no one really wanted it. I also pointed out that she herself had received a ring (passing wedding and engagement rings is a weird formal tradition in my family), and passed on the stuff I now had. Both my mom and the aunt who had given me the jewelry stood up for me, but my other aunt really dug in and said I had no right to alter family jewelry, and that changing it so I could wear it was entitled and destructive. \n\nI figured it would end when lunch ended, but I found out that my aunt was telling my cousins and my grandparents that I had ruined heirlooms to serve myself. I really didn't think that it was a big deal, but my grandmother sent me a message about how disappointed in me she was, and a few of my friends say you never ever alter family jewelry.

It was given to you; it's yours to do with what you want. Your relatives are being ridiculous.", "NTA. I received two rings from my grandmother, neither of which were my style. One I had restyled into a beautiful ring; the other I had a jeweler take the stones and turn them into a necklace. Now I actually wear them -- I can't imagine my grandmother preferring that they sit, unused, in my jewelry box.", "NTA - you weren\u2019t able to wear the jewelry in its current state so they would literally have just ended up in a different box in a different house. \n\nI inherited all of the jewelry when my mom passed. I\u2019ve since altered some of the pieces so i could wear them and also made a pair of earrings for my SIL to wear at my brothers wedding(Insert sad heartwarming story here about old/new/borrowed/blue). To me, I\u2019m breathing new life in to the pieces and there\u2019s a new and different meaning to the pieces.", "NTA.  Might need to over explain that the jeweler was clear that most of the jewelry was low value.  My family lived under the self imposed misconception that family heirlooms were extremely valuable for years.  They weren\u2019t.", "NTA\n\n\"family jewelry\"... gimme a break. They all refused to take these jewelry, and they were GIVEN to you.\n\nAnd even in case of \"official\" heirlooms (stipulated as such in testaments, etc.), many will still have them \"altered\", either to repair the heirloom or to make it fit to them.", "YTA. I wouldn\u2019t accept family jewelry if I planned to alter it. But if I received it and then thought about altering, I\u2019d ask the person who gave it. And return it if they weren\u2019t okay with that: Heirlooms are one of those things that don\u2019t just belong to you. They belong to the whole family in a way.", "WTH  NTA this is just bizarre.  I have a $10,000 dollar diamond ring heirloom that If I ever decided to wear it I'd have to get it altered to fit my tiny finger.  No one would give a shit.  Of course you alter jewelry so you can wear it.  You're not a storage shed.  You're a person.", "NTA. The point of jewelry is to be worn. It\u2019s stupid as hell for something unwearable to just sit in a box unappreciated. In a way I think it actually adds *more* significance to a generational piece if each new owner makes it their own with small alterations.", "NTA. You inherited the jewelry, it is yours, and you can do whatever you want with it. IMO, you honored it by turning it into pieces you can actually wear and enjoy. Your aunt is either bitter and petty or transferring her mourning of the relative who died into resentment for you. Or both.", "Not everything is a museum piece. Ignore her, and wear your pretties!", "They\u2019re upset about restringing glass pearls? And cleaning and removing one link from a bracelet?\n\nThese people are bananas. \n\nNTA.", "I'm still looking for the altering.  From what I can tell all you did was clean, repair and size the jewelry.  And with the most valuable piece being $300 max, I doubt any of this is the \"heirlooms\" your aunt believes they are.  Most likely, now that it looks good she is mad she didn't take it too.  NTA, enjoy your treasures that no one else wanted.", "What the hell, does she just expect you to store it in a shoebox forever, gazing at it wistfully from afar while occasionally reverently picking it up with white glvoes? Jewelry is meant to be worn, and if that means it needs to be altered to fit, so be it. It's not sacred artifacts, for chrissake.\n\nMy mom gave me her Dad's wedding ring when he passed a few years ago. Her expectation that I be able to wear it was so strong that she took me to her favorite jewelry store so they could alter it to fit me.\n\nUnless we're talking about the Crown Jewels, there's nothing wrong with altering jewelry that's been passed down. \n\nNTA", "\"Grandma, I'm so confused. Why are you 'disappointed' that I fixed the jewelry, instead of tossing it in a box somewhere where no one would see it or be able to wear it? I mean, the bracelet literally had a broken clasp so it would have remained permanently unwearable by anyone unless it was fixed, so what's the actual issue?\"\n\nNTA. Nearly everyone I know who has pieces that could be considered \"family heirlooms\" that anyone in the family actually wears has had to make some kind of adjustments to them. Whether it's fixing something that broke, replacing a stone (either because it was missing or they replaced a fake stone with a real one), resizing it to make it fit them or even altering it from a type of jewelry they wouldn't wear to become one they would (most stunning example is a hatpin that was turned into an engagement ring), the only way heirlooms become heirlooms is if each generation actually wears them. Otherwise, they tend to get sold off or disposed of.", "Nta what is the point of having it if not to wear it. You fixed them. Are these fancy China no one used type of people? You can\u2019t win with them. Just keep enjoying the pieces and know the person who originally owned it is probably happy it\u2019s being used and enjoyed x", "NTA. An heirloom is one that is passed down through several generations, so unless the aunt\u2019s jewellery came from another generation of family members it\u2019s not family/heirloom jewellery. Even if it was, all you did was clean it up except for two pieces. What\u2019s the point in letting it languish in your closet? Why even give it to you at all?", "I wonder if your aunt is pissed because the pieces she passed on now look great.  It's not like you completely altered the costume jewelry.  Hardly heirlooms unless there's a charming story behind them \nNTA.", "NTA you didn't ruin anything you pretty much just repaired it.", "Your friends and family are out to lunch on the \"never alter family jewellery\" buffet. \n\nJewellery is meant to be worn and shown off, and if a piece doesn't fit, you alter it to do so. That includes resizing rings, clasp and chain replacements for necklaces and pendants, even re-cutting gemstones when the original cut is outmoded or the gem somehow damaged. \n\nI'd argue that if these given to you as keepsakes only, keeping them in a box unaltered MIGHT be appropriate. But they weren't - it was a bunch of discards. \n\nNTA, and push back to the cousins and grandparents with \"no one wanted this stuff when it was offered. I took it when offered, and made it into things I can wear and remember XXX for. Now shut up about it.\"", "\u201cJewelry\u201d is different in my mind than costume pieces. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re talking about a vintage engagement ring.\n\nI personally think you did a great thing by making those pieces wearable and enjoying them. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your icky aunt was mad that she passed on those pieces, because you made them look great.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 my aunt tried to take my mom's heirloom...beat the shit out of her and I have it now...like my aunt yous can suck a fat one as well", "They\u2019ve altered the Crown Jewels of England many , many times over the centuries so I don\u2019t know where your high faluting family members are getting their arrogant ideas about \u201cfamily jewelry\u201d.\nNTA", "Your relatives are making no sense whatsoever. It was passed on to you for what, exactly? To sit in a box collecting dust because you're not allowed to alter it to be cherished and used? \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Even if these pieces were valuable to the family for sentimental reasons, it sounds like you treated them with respect. Jewelry is meant to be worn, not kept in a box unused, and sometimes it needs to be repaired in order to fulfill that purpose. If you have any ancestors that truly valued these pieces, they'd be glad that you cared about them enough yourself to fix the clasps and replace worn out strings.\n\nThe one benefit of the doubt I can give is that you may want to find out exactly what your aunt has been saying about you to your other family and friends. It's possible that she's been misleading them about either or both the importance those pieces have to the family and the extent of your alterations. If so, that's an easy misunderstanding to correct before any grudges take root.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
