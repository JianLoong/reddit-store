I have a small collection of vintage and modern jewelry I have collected over the years, and work adjacent to the industry, so once the family had sorted out the major pieces, my aunt thought I would like to have the rest and gave it to me. There were no stipulations, just \"this looked like something you may like\". Most of the things in the box were junk, but I did end up with three necklaces, a bracelet, two rings, and a very nice long strand of glass pearls.\n\nI took some of the better pieces to a jeweler friend of mine, who said at most one of the rings could be worth about $300, but the rest were all mid-range costume. He cleaned them up for me, and fixed a few pieces, including taking a piece out of the bracelet to make it fit and to fix a broken clasp, and adding some solder beads to the ring that was too big. The silk cord on the glass pearls was worn out, so I cut the strand and reknotted them into a more wearable piece. The ring and the bracelet have become everyday pieces for me, and I frequently wear the pearls for \"fancy\" dress.\n\nA month ago, my mom and I went out to lunch with her sisters, including the aunt who gave me the jewelry. She immediately noticed I was wearing some, so I told her a little bit about what my friend had told me, and showed her how he fixed them. I also showed her a picture of me wearing the pearls. My other aunt, who had been listening, immediately asked me what gave me the right to alter heirloom jewelry. I told her I wasn't aware that any of the pieces were heirlooms, and that since most of the family had already gone though it by the time I got it, I thought no one really wanted it. I also pointed out that she herself had received a ring (passing wedding and engagement rings is a weird formal tradition in my family), and passed on the stuff I now had. Both my mom and the aunt who had given me the jewelry stood up for me, but my other aunt really dug in and said I had no right to alter family jewelry, and that changing it so I could wear it was entitled and destructive. \n\nI figured it would end when lunch ended, but I found out that my aunt was telling my cousins and my grandparents that I had ruined heirlooms to serve myself. I really didn't think that it was a big deal, but my grandmother sent me a message about how disappointed in me she was, and a few of my friends say you never ever alter family jewelry.

They all refused to take these jewelry, and they were GIVEN to you.\n\nAnd even in case of \"official\" heirlooms (stipulated as such in testaments, etc.), many will still have them \"altered\", either to repair the heirloom or to make it fit to them.", "YTA.

Why are you 'disappointed' that I fixed the jewelry, instead of tossing it in a box somewhere where no one would see it or be able to wear it?

Nearly everyone I know who has pieces that could be considered \"family heirlooms\" that anyone in the family actually wears has had to make some kind of adjustments to them. Whether it's fixing something that broke, replacing a stone (either because it was missing or they replaced a fake stone with a real one), resizing it to make it fit them or even altering it from a type of jewelry they wouldn't wear to become one they would (most stunning example is a hatpin that was turned into an engagement ring), the only way heirlooms become heirlooms is if each generation actually wears them. Otherwise, they tend to get sold off or disposed of.", "Nta what is the point of having it if not to wear it. You fixed them. Are these fancy China no one used type of people?

It's possible that she's been misleading them about either or both the importance those pieces have to the family and the extent of your alterations.

Adding sizing beads,  shortening a bracelet and restringing pearls are all very basic repairs that we do to heirloom jewelry every day. \n\nThe odds of an inherited ring fitting the next owner without sizing are pretty low.  Pearls and beads need restringing with regular wear.  I had the pearls my grandmother gave me restrung as soon as she gave them to me as the silk was in very worn shape.  \n\nI've had customers completely rearrange the settings on heirloom pieces and sometimes that makes me cringe a little when the original is unique or nicely made,  but at the end of the day it is their jewelry to do with what they like.

That is the point of jewelry.  Altering them doesn't mean that they're ruined.

There's nothing to be ashamed about, and I'm sure your relative would be more happy that you are wearing them rather than letting them collect dust in storage.", "It\u2019s so much better to leave the \u201cfamily jewels\u201d buried away in a box to never see the light of day than it is to actually wear and enjoy them. /s\n\nNTA", "NTA. Jewellery gets old and breaks, styles go out of fashion, or it won\u2019t fit the person inheriting it, especially rings. My mum had a diamond ring with lots of small diamonds in a cluster setting on a thin gold band. She decided to turn it into 3 bands for me, her and my sister with a few diamonds each. It\u2019s a nice way of adapting something from generations before you to fit with the present imo.", "NTA. The adjustments you made don't change the value of the jewellery Nd now they will be worn often in memory of your deceased relative.\n\nWere you supposed to keep them in a box until you die and pass them onto someone else? Ridiculous", "> I had no right to alter family jewelry, and that changing it so I could wear it was entitled and destructive.\n\nat that point it's not \"jewelry\" any more, it's a trinket that you're obligated to keep track of.  Sounds like nonsense to me.", "Omg. This makes me so cross.  I am a former jewellery sales person. To remove a link to make a bracelet for you is normal. Pearls (and any beads that are worn often) should be restrung every few years. The silk they are stringed on stretches and could bark. \nSo you made the pieces fit you so you could actually wear them? You are amazing. Why have pieces gathering dust. In fact, if you had redesigned the items so you could wear them, I would still support you. \nJewellery that is not worn and enjoyed is a waste. \nWear them proudly. \nNTA.\nEdited as I am so annoyed.  I have diamond rings I never wear from my grannies and my mother.  I want to create a bracelet using all the stones so it is something I wear everyday.

I inherited my grandmother's engagement ring, my grandfather gave it directly to me. There was a small chip in the diamond so we have it placed into a necklace setting and inserted a small opal into the ring setting to keep everything safe and wearable.

Jewelry is to be seen or it has no purpose.", ">My other aunt, who had been listening, immediately asked me what gave me the right to alter heirloom jewelry.\n\nThe answer is: POSSESSION. These things were given to you. Jewelry is tangible real property, IDK WTF 'family property\" is, I don't think the law even recognizes such a concept.\n\nNTA.

Because she is lying, manufacturing drama by telling people you \u201cruined heirlooms\u201d, when no such thing is true. You haven\u2019t ruined anything, you just had pieces repaired or restrung so that you could wear them, instead of them just sitting in a box unused.\n\nAs for your friends \u2014 who cares what they think? Stop asking their opinions on the matter, it\u2018s none of their business, and they don\u2019t know what they are talking about. You absolutely can alter family jewelry, it\u2019s a very common thing to do.", "It\u2019s costume. It barely counts as real jewelry. It\u2019s definitely not in the category of priceless family heirlooms that are untouchable. NTA.\n\nGrandma and auntie are out of their minds.", "NTA. If an heirloom just sits in a box because it cannot be worn\u2026 then at some point down the line, it is not considered a valuable sentimental heirloom because there is no association with anyone who they cared for.\n\nWhomever inherits this jewelry from you will likely treasure it because it reminds them of you. They will incorporate it into their attire and whomever inherits it from them will hopefully treasure it because it reminds them of who wore it\u2026 and so on.\n\nThings are supposed to evolve and change so they can continue to be appreciated in the present. Heirlooms that aren\u2019t treasured just become a dollar as some point down the line.", "NTA.\nI've watched enough restoration type shows an such that people are often happy when something once broken is usable again.

You're wearing them in a respectful way. NTA", "NTA.  You repaired sentimental pieces so they could be worn and enjoyed. \n\nYou aunt would have had an apoplectic fit if she\u2019d seen what my sister-in-law did with all the costume jewelry we had after my MIL passed.  They were all very good pieces, but not really worth much.  She crafted these gorgeous Christmas trees from the various pieces, one for each DIL. They\u2019re framed in vintage looking frames.

Is the point to keep the memory or for it to be worn and loved?", "NTA - its a very rare piece of costume jewelry that could be considered an heirloom - and anyway. YOU are now the heir and you can do what you want with something as long as the giver did not have any stipulations when they gave it to you.", "NTA and WTF? If you can\u2019t wear it, they think you\u2018re basically just meant to provide storage because the others couldn\u2019t be bothered to store the items?", "NTA. Even if they were meant to be handed down unaltered,  what you did -replacing clasp, restringing and resizing is more mending and ensuring they aren't lost than it is altering.  \n  \nYou weren't informed of there being conditions attached to the inheritance. You would not have been TA even if you had completely dismantled a sentimental piece and had it melted down/all the stones reset but that is so far from what you did.", "NTA. You are allowed to alter your own belongings as you see fit.", "NTA\n\nYour aunt is being ridiculous.  I imagine that she would insist an inherited wedding gown not be altered; just belt it!", "NTA. Which is worse - SLIGHTLY altering the jewelry so it can be worn and appreciated, or letting it sit in a drawer somewhere? I was married using my great-grandmother's wedding ring and had it resized to fit me. From what I've heard about her, she would have 100% approved!", "Jeweler here. What did she expect you to do, put it in a box and let it rot without being enjoyed? Jewelry is meant to be worn, and the very nature of jewelry means that much of it can be altered from generation to generation, and passed on to someone who will enjoy and wear it.\n\nNTA. You do you.", "How else would you wear it or use it if not altered? Sounds like some jealousy here. NTA", "NTA - when my granny passed, my mum, sister and I got her jewellery. I got a couple of rings - one that was so worn through the back band that it was like wire (she was 99 years old and the ring was her mother's) and another that was a very formal-looking ring - not my style and if it were would look like an engagement/wedding ring (and I'm ace/never going to get married). So my mum and I found a jeweller who was able to combine both rings into a more modern style that I wear all the time now. \n\nMy sister also got a ring that was also very thin on the back of the band but she liked the style. The same jeweller used some of the gold from a broken necklace to rebuild it and it's now a restored piece that she wears also. \n\nIf we hadn't gotten these pieces changed, they would have just lingered and been forgotten about... But now we each have items we love to remind us of a person we love. Isn't that the point???", "NTA. Please enjoy the jewelry and ignore the haters. Your aunt is only jealous because she probably had no idea you could update the junk she gave you to such trendy levels. If I were you, I'd send everyone pictures of the before and after. The pieces given to you were the apparent leftovers no one wanted, no one mentioned they were heirlooms, but suddenly let's respect the junk of the dead and departed. Abeg jare, please! She's probably on the verge of launch a \"give them back\" campaign now that they look good.", "NTA. So would your aunt rather have the jewelry sit in a box hidden away and never cherished?

It\u2019s not like you\u2019re passing it back to them?", "NTA. your aunt is a dick.", "Your Aunt is just mad that she didn\u2019t take those pieces and update them. Lol tough luck for her", "NTA. It seems like your aunt was jealous that she didn't get the jewelry.", "okay so you altered them/fixed them so you could wear them?\n\nWhat exactly were you supposed to do with this \"heirloom\" jewelry?   Let them sit in a box unused?  Crazy and useless.\n\nyou are NTA.", "You changed the things so the would not fall off and fixed damaged parts it not altering Nta", "As a massive vintage jewelry collector, I say NTA. Your other aunt is having delusions of grandeur.  \n\nESPECIALLY on the costume items. They are not \"heirlooms\". An heirloom  is either very old or very valuable, and it sounds like these items are neither excpet that one ring. And the ring resizing is reversible.", "Not only the royal family! In aristocratic families with major inherited jewelry, it was quite often altered to make it wearable given current fashions and tastes. Your aunt is making herself ridiculous.", "They altered them for the coronation earlier this year.\n\nAnd not jsit the Crown jewels of Britain.

Often they may be completely melted down and remade into a modern design.\n\nAfter my FIL died at age 66, my MIL started a relationship with a widower. They both had their wedding bands (their own and their deceased spouses) melted down and turned into matching rings, which they enjoyed for 20 years before she died last year. I think that\u2019s beautiful.", "Came here to say this. OP said most of the jewelry is mid-range costume jewelry and they aren\u2019t very valuable.

Honestly,  it was going to be a baggie full of loose pearls if I hadn't done something with it.", "Take a look at pictures of the various wives of Henry the 8th.

Your aunt doesn't understand I guess?\n\nOn a personal note - I received a few pieces from my grandmother (most pieces had been stolen by carers). One ring was given for her position in the Eastern Star, the sister organization to the Masons.

Years later, I had a jeweler friend create two new pieces\u2014a beautiful pendant out of the center Diamond and a band with the smaller ones. Sadly, the pendant was token in a home robbery, but I wear the band every day as my wedding ring. \n\nNone of the pieces seem significantly altered and in the case of the pearls, that\u2019s just preservation work.
