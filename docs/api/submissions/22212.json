I have a small collection of vintage and modern jewelry I have collected over the years, and work adjacent to the industry, so once the family had sorted out the major pieces, my aunt thought I would like to have the rest and gave it to me. There were no stipulations, just \"this looked like something you may like\". Most of the things in the box were junk, but I did end up with three necklaces, a bracelet, two rings, and a very nice long strand of glass pearls.\n\nI took some of the better pieces to a jeweler friend of mine, who said at most one of the rings could be worth about $300, but the rest were all mid-range costume. He cleaned them up for me, and fixed a few pieces, including taking a piece out of the bracelet to make it fit and to fix a broken clasp, and adding some solder beads to the ring that was too big. The silk cord on the glass pearls was worn out, so I cut the strand and reknotted them into a more wearable piece. The ring and the bracelet have become everyday pieces for me, and I frequently wear the pearls for \"fancy\" dress.\n\nA month ago, my mom and I went out to lunch with her sisters, including the aunt who gave me the jewelry. She immediately noticed I was wearing some, so I told her a little bit about what my friend had told me, and showed her how he fixed them. I also showed her a picture of me wearing the pearls. My other aunt, who had been listening, immediately asked me what gave me the right to alter heirloom jewelry. I told her I wasn't aware that any of the pieces were heirlooms, and that since most of the family had already gone though it by the time I got it, I thought no one really wanted it. I also pointed out that she herself had received a ring (passing wedding and engagement rings is a weird formal tradition in my family), and passed on the stuff I now had. Both my mom and the aunt who had given me the jewelry stood up for me, but my other aunt really dug in and said I had no right to alter family jewelry, and that changing it so I could wear it was entitled and destructive. \n\nI figured it would end when lunch ended, but I found out that my aunt was telling my cousins and my grandparents that I had ruined heirlooms to serve myself. I really didn't think that it was a big deal, but my grandmother sent me a message about how disappointed in me she was, and a few of my friends say you never ever alter family jewelry.

They all refused to take these jewelry, and they were GIVEN to you.\n\nAnd even in case of \"official\" heirlooms (stipulated as such in testaments, etc.), many will still have them \"altered\", either to repair the heirloom or to make it fit to them.", "YTA.

Why are you 'disappointed' that I fixed the jewelry, instead of tossing it in a box somewhere where no one would see it or be able to wear it?

Nearly everyone I know who has pieces that could be considered \"family heirlooms\" that anyone in the family actually wears has had to make some kind of adjustments to them. Whether it's fixing something that broke, replacing a stone (either because it was missing or they replaced a fake stone with a real one), resizing it to make it fit them or even altering it from a type of jewelry they wouldn't wear to become one they would (most stunning example is a hatpin that was turned into an engagement ring), the only way heirlooms become heirlooms is if each generation actually wears them. Otherwise, they tend to get sold off or disposed of.", "Nta what is the point of having it if not to wear it. You fixed them. Are these fancy China no one used type of people?

It's possible that she's been misleading them about either or both the importance those pieces have to the family and the extent of your alterations.

Adding sizing beads,  shortening a bracelet and restringing pearls are all very basic repairs that we do to heirloom jewelry every day. \n\nThe odds of an inherited ring fitting the next owner without sizing are pretty low.  Pearls and beads need restringing with regular wear.  I had the pearls my grandmother gave me restrung as soon as she gave them to me as the silk was in very worn shape.  \n\nI've had customers completely rearrange the settings on heirloom pieces and sometimes that makes me cringe a little when the original is unique or nicely made,  but at the end of the day it is their jewelry to do with what they like.

That is the point of jewelry.  Altering them doesn't mean that they're ruined.

I've got a filligree ring that no one is allowed to change other than resizing but it's a very special piece and is from the 20's. Everything else is fair game.

Your method seems to have been quite non-invasive.
