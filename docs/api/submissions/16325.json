Sounds like he is an addict.", "NTA, but through gritted teeth as self-righteousness is not a good look. No one likes a leech, but all this stuff about how it\u2019s all purely down to your respective choices is unnecessarily reductive and lacks compassion.", ">Was i wrong for refusing to give my brother money when he messed up his own life?? \n\n>AITA for telling my brother it's his fault he is a failure?\n\nThese are 2 different questions. What are you asking us to judge?", "YTA.", "NTA.   \n\n\nYou are 13 years younger than your brother and it isn't your place to bail him out. Unless there is a pressing issue or condition in his life that you haven't mentioned, he needs to take some responsibility (though given your age gap there may be things you don't know). \n\nStealing from your literal baby sister is not a good look either. And I don't think a 40 year old man telling everyone in his neighbourhood that his baby sister won't give him pocket money makes him look as good as he may think it does.   \n\n\nIt isn't your job to fix him, people have to fix themselves, though sometimes they need expert and professional help to do so. You make it sound like that isn't necessary, your brother just didn't apply himself and then didn't make a choice to try pulling up and doing things differently in the 20+ years since he did high school. He has the choice to try to get out of the rut available to him, he either can't see it or won't make it.   \n\n\nHe could still change, I've known people his age do it, but it literally has to come from within himself and you supporting him with cash to continue not doing much isn't going to help, while supporting him emotionally if he genuinely tries to change would. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. Don't care about what he thinks. It's not worth it.", "Whether or not he failed at school sounds irrelevant to me. He's a thief, and he's trying to be a leech. You are NTA but it must be hard to have a brother who behaves like that; maybe you could treat yourself to some therapy to help shrug off the guilt.", "Oh, c'mon. The situation he is in is fully, 100% because of the choices he made- and continues to make as a fully grown 41 yr old. Why should anyone have compassion?", "I would say the two questions tie into each other. OP's brother has no job, and thus, no money, so he's constantly asking to borrow from people without making any effort to find a way to support himself.", "What!? Why?", "Probably he is the brother", "Seemed obvious to me", "Nope", "That telling someone that failed themselves did it to themselves? \n\nSure, maybe the brother needed mental help. But at some point, you are responsible for your own actions at the end of the day and it\u2019s unfair to expect someone else to keep making up for your own shortcomings.", "Yes.", "Okay.", "Have a nice day", "INFO: was your brother ever diagnosed with a disability, mental illness, learning disability, or substance use disorder?", "NTA he\u2019s just a parasite. Can\u2019t pick your family but you certainly don\u2019t need to finance them.", "NTA", "NTA! He needs to grow up and take responsibility for himself and his actions (it sounds like that would be a first for him?).", "NTA he is responsible for himself.  He's 41 years old, he's got to figure it out.  \n\nI wouldn't worry too much about him talking to other people about you, I'm guessing they all see who he is pretty clearly, and he's probably asked all of them for money too.", "NTA for not giving him money, but I suspect you don't know the full story of his high school years, since you were so young then.\n\nWhether you want to find more out is up to you, but it may help you understand, if not excuse, his behaviour.", "NTA cut him off", "NTA. Does your brother have a history with drugs or alcohol? It really sounds like he may be using. Please don't give him money. You'll only be enabling him. That will get him no where!", "op=NTA\n\nYou don't need to give him money.  He is NOT your responsibility.\n\nYou could be snarky and give him a bill for all the money he took, all the food he stole and tell him you'll consider loaning him money,  AFTER he's paid that back.\n\nBasically, your mother enabled his behavior(stealing) and he never learned consequences.", "NTA. And if anyone says different, give brother their cell number and let him know they want to help. \nThe only reason your brother is a mooch is because other people allow and support it. Don't be that person. As someone here said, don't put yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. \nMy brother had a friend like this.  Grew up in middle class America, two parents, all the advantages. Never worked a day in his life. Spent every day sleeping till two, avoiding his kid, partying and living off his elderly parents. By 50 he was an old, old man. At 55 he discovered meth. His heart gave out less than two years later. Total wasted life. \nYou just can't help some people.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, no two siblings EVER have the same opportunities. You have no clue what his childhood was like. More importantly, YTA for calling him a \"failure\". That says more about you than it does about him. Judgemental much? You have every right to withhold your money but your high and mighty attitude is showing, and it's ugly."]}
