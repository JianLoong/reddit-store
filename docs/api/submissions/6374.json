Just for some context I (23F) am overweight, 5\u20190 and 380lbs. My doctor said for somebody of my size I am healthy and that unless I want to lose weight, I can\u2019t make myself any better than I am right now. I had a few scares a few years ago but I don\u2019t have diabetes, heart problems etc\n\nI also run a tiktok page with my boyfriend (32M) where I show off my body to promote that health can come at any size. I also model on there sometimes but it\u2019s mostly debunking misinformation about being overweight and showing that being fat is okay\n\nAbout a month ago, my mom (50F) found this page. She rung me and told me that I need to lose weight immediately, and that I will die if I don\u2019t. She told me that she can\u2019t enable me anymore and that she won\u2019t speak to me unless I\u2019m a normal weight and break it off with my boyfriend (she thinks he\u2019s enabling me but that\u2019s a whole different story good lord). I didn\u2019t speak with her after this\n\nBut she sent me information details to a weight watchers account on Christmas and she said it was my present. She paid for a trial for me and told me to just \u201cgive it a go\u201d and if I don\u2019t like it then I don\u2019t have to lose any weight. I was so annoyed at this point and I told her that her attitude is what gets fat people to hate themselves because they believe they\u2019re not good enough \n\nShe told me that I was being a disrespectful brat and that she didn\u2019t raise me this way. She told me that she can\u2019t speak me with anymore because she just gets angry. AITA? Maybe I could\u2019ve phrased it in a nicer way and I feel really bad that I am hurting our relationship, but it is also not my fault that she is being fed misinformation about my weight", "created_utc": 1672755139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10297y9/aita_for_telling_my_mom_shes_the_reason_fat/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just for some context I (23F) am overweight, 5\u20190 and 380lbs. My doctor said for somebody of my size I am healthy and that unless I want to lose weight, I can\u2019t make myself any better than I am right now. I had a few scares a few years ago but I don\u2019t have diabetes, heart problems etc\n\nI also run a tiktok page with my boyfriend (32M) where I show off my body to promote that health can come at any size. I also model on there sometimes but it\u2019s mostly debunking misinformation about being overweight and showing that being fat is okay\n\nAbout a month ago, my mom (50F) found this page. She rung me and told me that I need to lose weight immediately, and that I will die if I don\u2019t. She told me that she can\u2019t enable me anymore and that she won\u2019t speak to me unless I\u2019m a normal weight and break it off with my boyfriend (she thinks he\u2019s enabling me but that\u2019s a whole different story good lord). I didn\u2019t speak with her after this\n\nBut she sent me information details to a weight watchers account on Christmas and she said it was my present. She paid for a trial for me and told me to just \u201cgive it a go\u201d and if I don\u2019t like it then I don\u2019t have to lose any weight. I was so annoyed at this point and I told her that her attitude is what gets fat people to hate themselves because they believe they\u2019re not good enough \n\nShe told me that I was being a disrespectful brat and that she didn\u2019t raise me this way. She told me that she can\u2019t speak me with anymore because she just gets angry. AITA? Maybe I could\u2019ve phrased it in a nicer way and I feel really bad that I am hurting our relationship, but it is also not my fault that she is being fed misinformation about my weight\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Mom cares about you, and I don\u2019t care what you think your doctor is telling you, but your weight makes you unhealthy (\u201cI\u2019ve had a few scares\u201d) and you will most likely die much too early.

Your mom\u2019s delivery and approach are terrible but her intentions are likely good.

I absolutely do not believe that OP's doctor is telling her she's perfectly healthy - the doctor probably just realizes that it's not a useful discussion to have with her.", "What's ESH?", "Yep. OP, your mom loves you. She is concerned with your well-being, long term.", "No way 5ft & 380 is anywhere near healthy.. can\u2019t see past that.", "\\*380 lbs at *23 years of age*.\n\nBeing that heavy at that age is guaranteed to burden their skeletal structure, cause cardiovascular issues that may or may not exist already, stunt the remainder of their growth (5'0\" is very short) and cripple their immune system.\n\nOP, please reconsider your lifestyle. HAES is bunk, weighing nearly 400 lbs in your early 20s is going to cause you issues in the near future if it isn't causing them now, and I'd rather not find out you were a candidate for My 600 LBS Life in a couple years.", "I'm not saying OP would not benefit from loosing weight, of course she would. I'm saying, from the information she has provided, although she is overweight she is still in good health and it is up to her how she lives her life.", "I mean, 190 would be reasonable. Heavy for that height, but not \"immediately seek help, my god\" weight.\n\nI'm fat myself, but not 380 at 5'0.

Most doctors won't address a weight problem unless the patient is receptive to making a change because it's a waste of time. Absence of Diabetes isn't the only indication good health, but OP is going to believe what she wants to believe.", "I was wondering this myself. She's obese class 3.

OP is hearing what she wants to hear. She doesn\u2019t have weight-related health problems YET, but nobody can live an entire lifetime at that weight. Nobody can live past their 30s without extreme pain at the weight either. She is misinterpreting what her doctor is trying to ethically tell her.\n\nSelf love at every size is so important. So is adequately acknowledging that you don\u2019t have to be healthy to love yourself. It\u2019s dangerous to conflate the two and just pretend that morbid obesity itself is healthy, because it medically is not.", "Same vibe as I smoke 20 a day but am completely healthy", "She didn\u2019t say she cut her off. She said she can\u2019t speak to her anymore because she gets angry. She didn\u2019t say forever so I took it as she needed a break\u2026 I don\u2019t know any parent who would be ok watching their child do something that is harmful and not speak on it. There is no way 5\u20190 380 is healthy anywhere\u2026 I would be terrified for my child.", "cancer isn\u2019t typically a disease people associate with obesity, so obviously being the same size as someone who got cancer is irrelevant. cardiovascular disease & severe joint problems are way more prevalent among obese people, so though this instance may be anecdotal, it\u2019s definitely in line with expectations.", "Obesity does not equate to cancer.", "Honestly even in the post it seems like the doctor didn\u2019t say that, \u2018unless I want to lose weight, I can\u2019t make myself any better than I am right now\u2019.

Can you please provide a source?\n\n\"Not perfect\" is very different from \"fake\". The fact of the matter is that the number on the scale very much correlates to life expectancy. \n\nMother is overbearing.

It\u2019s part of a bigger picture. I believe in body positivity. At the same time, I also want to be real with patients. Those numbers directly correlate to life expectancy. If you\u2019re 50 pounds overweight, your likelihood of dying of any cause is twice as high as someone who is not overweight. If you\u2019re 100 pounds overweight, it\u2019s three times higher. We want to be supportive and give people options. But we also don't want to shy away from something that\u2019s as serious a problem as cancer.  \nIs BMI an accurate measure of health?  \nHussain: It is not perfect at all. BMI is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. We need to use BMI in conjunction with a variety of different factors \u2013 sex and gender, ethnicity and muscle mass. BMI is still a useful tool to generally assess a person\u2019s life expectancy and risk of developing diseases like diabetes or cancer. It\u2019s the best we\u2019ve got and an easy number to calculate. While there are other tests that are more involved and accurate, like measuring the percentage of body fat or water, BMI is still very useful because anyone can calculate it based on height and weight.", "Ya, my bmi is within the \u201cnormal\u201d range but I am chubby. I have stomach fat that isn\u2019t healthy. Someone can be athletic and have an \u201cobese\u201d bmi. So you\u2019re right about that. \n\nHowever, OP is not healthy no matter how she tries to spin it. It\u2019s like the equivalent of someone in their 20s who binge drinks and eats unhealthy but are fine until they get older then the health issues start. \n\nAlso, the \u201chealthy at all size\u201d movement has really been taken out of context. It doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re healthy when you\u2019re absolutely obese, it just means you don\u2019t need to be a size 0 or have visible abs to be considered healthy. You can still be a bit overweight and still be healthy and workout. 5 feet and pushing 400 lbs is like a basketball with legs and arms, you can\u2019t look at that and seriously say that\u2019s healthy.", "Dude, you nailed it.

As in your weight is a huge immovable obstruction to your health improving at all, so if you don't commit to losing weight then there's nothing more I can help with.\n\nThat's her Dr literally giving up on her.

Her doctor said that her health could only improve if she started a weight loss journey.", "That's exactly what I think it is. I have a caffeine addiction, and while I have cut down to 2-3 cups a day, I cannot and will not go below that unless it becomes a major strain on my health.

That's exactly the phrasing I was looking for as it seemed a bit \"icky\" when I read it but did not want to jump on the fatphobic train (if that makes sense).

Yes, it is better to not be overweight, but it is still possible to live a healthy life. This is what she is promoting.\n\nOP going on Tiktok and giving information around this is not encouraging people to gain weight. It is teaching short minded people like yourself that being overweight is not always a bad thing.", "R/theresanecho", "It is, though. It is a bad thing and there is literally no situation in which it would be healthier to be overweight than to be fit.", "It's possible to be overweight and medically healthy, it's impossible to be extremely obese and sustainably medically healthy. Health at all size is bullshit and it is, in fact, promoting unhealthy lifestyle.", "Yay! 10/10 on your mental gymnastics!", "r/spellingmistake", "I think the point is that you can't judge a person's health by how they look. When I was obese (170lbs at 5'0), all my labs were fine. Low cholesterol, low blood pressure, no nutritional deficiencies, not a single noteworthy thing, nothing even approaching a concern. I eat a low dairy, high fiber and veg pescatarian diet, and have for years. I did however have a ton of health problems and was constantly advised to lose weight. And I did, because I was sick.  I now weigh 130, a perfectly \"healthy\" BMI. I didn't try to lose 40 lbs in 4 months, and none of my doctors found that rapid, unintentional weight loss concerning because I was fat. They're concerned now though. I'm still sick. I'm still in constant pain. Sure do wish we had focused on what could be causing my symptoms beyond being overweight! Turns out I have a connective tissue disorder that explains everything from my constant joint paint to my chronic migraines. I wasn't in pain because I was fat, and losing weight has not impacted my pain levels.  \nMy late mother on the other hand was 5'5 and 115 my whole life. She appeared very fit. She was INCREDIBLY unhealthy. She smoked a pack a day, drank, literally only ate pastries, NEVER exercised. She looked great right up until her death at 63.   \n\n\nSo who is healthier? The fat lady with a whole food diet who regularly exercises? Or the beautiful thin lady who abused her body into an early grave? I can tell you one thing, only one of us was ever bullied over their \"poor health\" and it wasn't my mom. Having been everything from underweight at 90 lbs when I was 20, to obese at 34, back down to a \"normal\" weight, I can very easily see that we police fat bodies because we don't like looking at them, and hate the idea that anyone could feel comfortable in a body that you personally find disgusting."]}
