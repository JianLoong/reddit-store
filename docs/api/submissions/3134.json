{"id": 3134, "submission_id": "z3l6pl", "title": "AITA for telling my dad he cannot drink at my house", "selftext": "Growing up my dad was a severe alcoholic and was also addicted to drugs. He was not functional at all and he never had a job. My mother worked 2 jobs in order to care for my brother and I. He would steal money from her and leave for days to do drugs. When I was 3, my mom finally took me and my brother and the three of us went to live with my grandparents who helped raise us so my mom could work. My mother put herself through nursing school by working multiple jobs so she could give my brother and I a better life. I can honestly say that I don\u2019t harbor any resentment towards my father but I do wish I had a more normal childhood. My dad loved us and was good to us in the memories I have of him when I was younger. I did witness him get arrested when I was like 3 or 4 though and I still remember it. My mother never talked bad about my dad and if I asked why he never came to visit us or went years without calling, she just simply told me that he was sick and was at a place getting better. Once I got older, I learned this \u2018place\u2019 was prison. My dad never paid child support, he never sent us birthday cards and would only call if he wasn\u2019t in jail. Things were hard for my mother but I never knew just how hard she had it until I got older. \n\nI am 32 years old and my dad is STILL doing the same old shit. He has diabetes now and neglected to care for himself properly and unfortunately he had to have his leg amputated because of this. My grandmother passed away and left him a lot of money so he was able to go to a rehabilitation place where he now lives.\n\nMy parents are divorced now but this year for thanksgiving they are both coming to our house to see my five kids whose ages range from 1-12. My mother visits multiple times a week but my dad hasn\u2019t seen them in years because he hasn\u2019t been sober. Last time I had him at my house for a few days, he drank the whole entire time, he barely showered so he smelled gross, and he smokes constantly so he always smelled like smoke. He got so drunk he pissed on the front seat of my car AND on my fucking couch where my children sit! (They were not home). I was so pissed but I did not say anything because I do feel bad for him to see him in such a bad state. We threw the couch away and bought another one. My mother just texted me and said my dad is trying to make her stop for beer on the way over and I said hell no! Am I wrong for this? Obviously he is a grown adult and can drink if he wants to but I do not want him pissing on my couch again. My husband and I do not drink because I struggled with addiction many years ago. My dad was the one who actually introduced me to the drug I became addicted to. I\u2019ve been clean for a long time and I never have cravings so that\u2019s not even the reason I don\u2019t want him drinking. It\u2019s how he behaves when he drinks. I don\u2019t want that shit around my toddlers and especially not my pre-teens. Am I being an asshole by telling him he can\u2019t drink?\n\nUpdate to add: my dad agreed he would not drink today at my house and he arrived a bit ago. The moment he got into the door he started asking my husband to go get him alcohol because he is having withdrawals from the pain killers he gets at the nursing home. He was picked up yesterday and hasn\u2019t had any since yesterday. Then while we were outside talking just me and him, he pulled his fucking DICK OUT and started peeing in a plastic container he has on his wheelchair when he can\u2019t make it to the bathroom. He did not ask for someone to help him get to the bathroom and he did not turn around or ask me to turn around, he just pulled it out while we were having a conversation! I quickly turned around and just awkwardly started playing on my phone when he then asks me to empty his piss container that has pee dripping all down the side! How in the fuck did I come from this man? My mother is such a decent woman and my brother and I have done very well in life so it is just crazy to me that this man is my father! My mom said he used to be normal but I don\u2019t remember that. \n\nI told my mom to take him back to the nursing home before my kids get home.", "created_utc": 1669299669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3l6pl/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_cannot_drink_at_my/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Put up any boundary you want. You should be so proud of yourself for what you have overcome. I admire you. You don't owe him anything, certainly not the **privilege** of drinking at your house.", "Soooo NTA. You\u2019re very good-hearted, & your mom is a freaking saint!", "NTA for wanting this boundary.  However, due to the severe health risks associated with alcohol withdrawal, I'd suggest starting the rule next time, and making it clear in advance what the expectation is.  You don't want your Thanksgiving turning into the kids watching him taken away in an ambulance.  It sounds like he's a very heavy drinker.", "NTA. It isn't your fault that you have the ability to set appropriate boundaries but your father doesn't. Yes, he's an adult who is free to choose to drink - but not to drink anywhere. If he wants to drink he is free to leave your house and not come back until he is sober. Stick to your boundaries, and let your dad make his own decision based on your limits and your rules for your house. I hope you have a happy, and sober, Thanksgiving.", "Its unfortunate that he's traveling with your mother. I definitely think you should say no; but it's going to turn ugly I suspect. \n\nLikely he won't be willing to stay long.", "NTA. If your father can't enjoy a simple dinner without getting drunk, perhaps he should be limited to eating with you at fast food restaurants, not $#@& Thanksgiving. \n\nHas he ever acknowledged the damage he has caused?", "NTA I have that rule with my alcoholic father, (but he only stays hours at a time)..however, and it's a big one...\n\n If he is still consuming alcohol daily he could very well go into withdrawal and die. My father tried to quit cold turkey once and I Rush him to the hospital becuase he didn't realize he need benzos in order to get through the withdrawal. I get where you're coming from but it could actually end up much worse for you if he still a severe alcoholic. Withdrawal doesn't take long to start if he is a severe alcoholic. \n\nI'm so sorry you even have to deal with this, it is a hell of a disease that effects the entire family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m so sorry that he really was not a good father, and continues to subject you to a lot of neglectful tendencies even into adulthood. You literally don\u2019t owe him anything, and if he wants to see his grandchildren, he gets to make the choice on whether or not he follows those rules.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. This is a healthy boundary. Your kids don\u2019t need to see all that. I hope you have a good holiday.", "NTA \n\nYou have a right to set that type of boundary. You don\u2019t want that around your kids. That\u2019s the least he can do for you is to not drink while he\u2019s at your house.", "Nta your an adult with your own family and since he screwed it up once he can go without alchohol or not show up.", "NTA. Yes your father is an adult who can decide for himself. But he is visiting your house. Your house your rules. He gotta accept and respect them especially cause you have small children. No child should see their grand/parents in that state. Your family comes first, don't hesitate to put your foot down.", "YTA for having this man around your kids. You are absolutely correct in not wanting him to drink at your house, but the fact that he has behaved this way in front of your kids and continues to be welcome in their lives is mindboggling to me.", "NTA. Your no-drinking boundaries in your home are healthy boundaries. But you know he\u2019s going to drink anyway, right?", "NTA. You need to set clear boundaries and protect you and your loved ones from the destructive behaviour your father is exhibiting. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t have a better role model.", "NTA for setting boundaries and rules. It's good, healthy and important for your children to see. But you kind of are if you didn't make this crystal clear to him at the point of the invite. He's an alcoholic, it's probably very hard to suddenly go cold turkey, especially if it's out of the blue and he hasn't taken any steps to prepare himself for it, not telling him immediately sets him up to fail, not that he needs much help with that. He is already on his way, so in a difficult position, he could have declined the invite if he was told upfront or at the least known what was expected of him. \n\nPut your big girl pants on and tell your dad the truth about how you feel, how his visit and general lifestyle has affected you and that drinking is not acceptable in your home as he cannot do so responsibly.", "NTA. If your father had any respect for you at all, he would refrain from drinking in your house without even asking. I do not think he has the right to drink in your house, based on his previous conduct. Why would you subject your children to this? I would refuse to host him, unless it is a completely dry affair.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. No drinking at all, and no smoking in the house. Accept those conditions or don't show up.", "If your house rules are no alcohol, you are entitled to enforce them in your home. About a little under a quarter of US homes are no alcohol, so it's not an uncommon thing. Your Dad is in the wrong here not you. A social drinker would have no problem with you rules.\n\nGo to Al-anon meeting (if there are no meetings call) https://al-anon.org/ Its for family and friends of alcoholics or addicts. They can give best advice on what to do.", "NTA at all!", "When I was younger I used to get so angry at my grandparents when they would tell my dad he couldn\u2019t come over if he was drinking and of course he never came. Now that I am older I see why they did not want him drinking at their house.", "Because he is in a nursing home he cannot drink but he said that the family members of other patients bring alcohol and he drinks when he can get it. He did just now tell me that he has been on pain killers since getting to the nursing home but never told us this before my mom picked him up to spend a few days with her. Now he is in withdrawals and 3 hours away from the nursing home! I do not know why he would even leave there if this is the case", "Thank you I hope you have a lovely thanksgiving as well! My dad doesn\u2019t think like a normal person does. I\u2019m not even sure he would understand boundaries.", "He said he is having withdrawals from the pain killers they give him at the nursing home. My mom picked him up yesterday so he hasn\u2019t had any since yesterday afternoon and he did not tell us this until just now. He does not drink everyday because he obviously can\u2019t get around and he relies on family members of other residents to bring alcohol in. My guess is as soon as he left yesterday he started thinking of ways to get alcohol. This is the first time in two years he has left the nursing home. \n\nNo he had not acknowledged it. My brother and I talk on the phone with him about once a month and we never talk about the past. We agreed that it is unlikely he will change and there is no point in telling him that he was/is shit. Thankfully my mother remarried soon after she left my dad and my stepdad did such a great job raising us. He treated us like we were his own kids", "Thank you, you too", "He agreed not to drink but since he has gotten here he has asked my husband to get him alcohol. My husband said no and it\u2019s just sad that this is how his life has turned out", "I actually said I don\u2019t want that shit around my kids. Which is why I said he can\u2019t come if he is drinking.", "Yes I know. He will always find a way! He lives in a nursing home and the family members of other patients bring it to him when they visit.", "We told him he could not come if he is going to drink and he agreed he would not. However since getting here he has been pestering my husband to go get him alcohol. It\u2019s almost like he has the brain of a small child and even when told no he continues to ask.\n\nMy mom remarried and my step dad is actually a great person and took very good care of us! I really don\u2019t feel like I missed out on having a dad", "We told him last week when we made the plans for my mom to drive 3 hours and pick him up and he agreed he would not drink. He did not tell us until JUST NOW though that since he\u2019s been in the nursing home he has been getting pain killers so now he is in withdrawal. I don\u2019t know why the hell he would leave there for a few days knowing he would not have his meds. Obviously since he lives in a nursing home he is not supposed to be drinking but he said even though he doesn\u2019t drink everyday anymore he still finds ways to get alcohol occasionally.", "We don\u2019t drink so there is no alcohol here and he agreed he would not bring any. When he\u2019s sober he actually acts normal and he is good with my kids. He was always kind when I was younger and had a lot of patience. He has just gotten worse as time went on which is inevitable. Even though he agreed he would not drink he had been pestering my husband to go get him some which he obviously said no to.", "Yea, I'm sure that was hard for a child to understand. I'm sorry you had to go through all that. Alcoholism is so awful for all involved.", "If he\u2019s on legitimate, prescribed painkillers, he should have some already and would have brought them with him. Either he sold them, he doesn\u2019t have a prescription and has been getting them illicitly somehow, *or* he\u2019s lying to get you to bring him alcohol. I note that he asked your husband to bring him alcohol, not pick up painkillers\u2026 so I\u2019m leaning towards \u201clying about painkiller use to get alcohol\u201d.\n\nI strongly suggest you call his nursing home, tell them what\u2019s happening and what he said, and ask them if they can take him back early.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. You seem gracious.", "Yeah I thought it was weird that he wouldn\u2019t have had any to bring with him. Is likely he is probably using that excuse to get alcohol. I just told my mom to take him back before my kids get home. When he is sober he is actually a decent person but he never stays sober", "It sucks that he\u2019s like this, but you\u2019re completely NTA. You deserve a happy holiday with the members of your family who won\u2019t turn it into a pee-soaked drunken horror."]}
