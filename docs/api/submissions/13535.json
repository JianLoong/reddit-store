I had her as my maid of honor 8 years ago and she promised me that I could be hers when her wedding came around.\n\nI have 2 kids, 6F and 3F. They're the flower girls.\n\nMy marriage fell apart just over two years ago, due to a stillbirth and my husband's infidelity. My parents and sister were the only reason I didn't drown from the stress, loneliness, and total abandonment of my spouse. I was a total mess.\n\nI went to therapy, got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression, quit drinking, and I owe a lot of it to my amazing sister. She's the reason why I kept chasing down my ex for child support when he stopped suddenly paying (he suddenly switched from \"world's best dad\" to \"deadbeat dumbass\" so quickly that my ex MIL is disgusted with him)\n\nStella and Jon 35M engaged last year. His parents are paying about 60% of the wedding. Our parents are paying 30% Stella and Jon paying for the rest themselves.\n\nThe biggest caveat is that they **must** be married in Jon's family's church, full mass with communion. The family is on board because this is going to be a very big wedding.\n\nTonight, Stella had invited me to dinner, as they had finally reserved a date for the church and reception, assuming it was to formally ask me to be her MOH. I was excited since I haven't been in a wedding party aside from my own wedding.\n\nJon was with her, weird because Stella didn't mention him coming at all in our texts about the dinner. We hugged like usual but Jon didn't. Weirder.\n\nAfter we got our drinks, they got to it. In a nutshell, Jon expressed the following: \"Despite my best efforts to keep it secret, my parents found out that you're divorced when they asked why your husband wasn't coming. They are no longer comfortable with you as MOH, because it won't look good to the church if my family hears about the divorce. You can be a bridesmaid but can't mention the divorce or your conditions at all during the wedding events.\"\n\nI was stunned, and I felt tears in my eyes. Stella started crying too and she tried to spin it in a good way. \"This is way less stressful for you, so it's a good thing! MIL has already approved my BFF as my MOH, so please don't make this any harder.\"\n\nI knew that I couldn't possibly stay there through an entire meal. I had to process this new info alone. I didn't speak. I just paid for my wickedly expensive cocktail, and left to order an Uber home.\n\nA few hours ago, I texted Stella that I would not be in her wedding party at all. That was my decision. I wouldn't pull my daughters out, but I would only attend as a guest.\n\nShe wouldn't take this as an answer, so I had to temp block her due to her excessive texts and calls. I sent my parents a summary of what happened and promised to call them when I was in better shape tomorrow.\n\nStella thinks that this is a total overreaction. I don't even want to know what Jon thinks at this point.\n\nPlease help me. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the responses. I half expected to be told to just put up with it and be a plain bridesmaid, which while difficult I kinda would have forced myself to just to make Stella happy. I was just so blindsided and I feel like I've been gut-punched, and I do need to be told if I am overreacting in a big way sometimes.\n\nI'm going to fall asleep now while binging Friends.

Like [MIL approved BFF to be MOH] what the actual hell? Good thing you noped out because I have a funny feeling you won't be the only one if MIL is controlling this from behind the scenes.", "NTA \n\nHonestly I wouldn\u2019t let the kids be in this wedding either, they don\u2019t need to be subjected to the in laws high and mighty attitude.", "Yikes.\n\nNTA, be prepared for your sister's in-laws to try to push you out of her life, because its already starting.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised your sister didn\u2019t have your back.", "NTA.  You have been judged not worthy by your sister's soon-to-be husband and in-laws, and so, in a sense, they are the ones making this decision for you.  By the mere fact that you still want to attend as a guest shows that you are not making this decision lightly or out of spite.\n\nBest of luck to you and I feel very sorry for your sister who is marrying an extremely judgmental fiance with parents even worse.  There are many Catholics that are not like this, and for those that are, it seems to be the exact opposite of what Jesus would have wanted.", "Nta. Shes bending to the will of inlaws who are footing the bill and now  believe they have some power over decisions.  She should've stand by you as her identical sister. IMO.", "NTA.   A low blow.   Just because his parents are paying for the majority of the wedding it doesn't give them the right to dictate who is and isn't the MOH that is your SISTERS choice.   Just like it's her choice in what she wears on the big day.  I think you are dealing with it really well.   You are allowing your girls to still be in the wedding and you are still attending the wedding as a guest.   \n\nIf your sister wants to allow her future in laws to dictate her life that's her choice, but it's not yours and good for you for sticking up for yourself but still choosing to be there for her on her big day.   I'm not sure I would be able to", "NTA!!  Not even a little bit.  You handled the situation far better than most people would!  Do NOT let your sister or your parents bully you about this.  You need to do what is best for your own mental health.  Being downgraded from MOH is humiliating, and everyone in your family will know something is wrong.  I bet your sister hasn't even thought about that, she's so worried about making MIL like her!\n\nHonestly, your sister should be grateful you're still willing to attend the wedding at all.  It's beyond gracious of you to allow your daughters to still be flower girls, but unless you've already promised it to them you might want to reconsider.  If MIL is that judgmental, you don't know what she'll say about, in front of, or directly to your daughters.  I wouldn't trust her around them, personally.", "NTA \n\nI am so sorry, you must be crushed. This feels like a major betrayal to me, and it's not my sister. \n\nYour sister *knows* why you are divorced. Your husband was unfaithful. That is a legitimate reason to divorce even in most fundy churches. \n\nJon could have just told his parents that your husband left you. He didn't have to mention divorce. He knew this was going to be an issue for his parents. Maybe he shares their views since he was the one to speak. \n\nThis is all about there parents image which is ridiculous. \n\nI can't believe your sister tried to put a \"good\" spin on it. Holy crap. \n\nGood on you for keeping your cool and not dumping the cocktail on their heads.", "I was totally prepared to be on the other side, but you are absolutely NTA. Your sister sacrificed you in lieu of her future in-laws judgmental religious choices, and the fact that she allowed it blows my mind. You\u2019re not overreacting. If this were my sister, I would\u2019ve been devastated.", "That\u2019s awful and I\u2019m so sorry. Jon\u2019s family doesn\u2019t have a single clue as to what it means to be a true Catholic either. There\u2019s absolutely no way they should be behaving like this-it\u2019s controlling. Your sister possibly appears to be coerced into this based on her FILs paying for the wedding. Before making this decision, I would be asking her if this is what she really wants or if she\u2019s being forced into it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nHer future husband and in-laws are using money to control her and that really sucks. Especially since she\u2019s just complicit with it.", "I feel like you know you are NTA but if you need reassurance, then please consider this it.", "I can\u2019t even. Really, I just can\u2019t. No OP, you are not in the wrong and I think you are being remarkably kind by attending and letting your kids participate because I honestly don\u2019t have that kind of goodness in me. Kudos to you for being the bigger, better person. NTA", "NTA\u2026obligatory \u201cweddings seem to bring out the worst in people\u201d.", "NTA\n\nI grew up in a family with similar values to your sisters in-laws. To me it sounds like your sister is marrying into an extremely controlling family, and likely does not have strong boundaries. She asked you to be her MOH originally- so I would bet that IS what she actually wants (Try to take some small comfort in that), and she IS probably genuinely upset at the thought of you not being in the wedding at all (at least IMO). However, she has chosen to bend to her in laws demands instead of sticking up for her own wants/needs, and she has hurt you in the process. Whatever her reasoning, the fact remains \u2014 Your sister could have chosen to stand up to her in laws and refuse to remove you as MOH due to your divorce \u2014 an action she had to know would hurt you. **When she chose to prioritize her in laws demands, it naturally had consequences. That consequence is that she hurt you deeply, and thus you no longer want to be in her wedding party.** You are allowed to feel that way (I would too!). I would bet this is not the response your sister expected, and now she is panicking and blowing you up because this isn\u2019t the ending she anticipated. However, thats not your problem or fault. **She made choices and now has to live with the consequences of her own actions. Your hurt is justified and so is your decision to drop out of the wedding party .**\n\nAlso for what it\u2019s worth - I think the fact that your sister knows how extremely difficult your divorce was for you makes her decision even more horrible. Being divorced does not mean there is anything wrong with you, it is nothing to be ashamed of. Sisters fianc\u00e9 and his family are all sorts of problematic. Serious \ud83d\udea9energy. Avoid them as much as you can in the future. \n\n**bottom line**: while your sister is within her rights to change MOHs, you also are within your rights to be (understandably) very upset and decide you do not want to be in the wedding party anymore. You did NOTHING wrong. Your sisters in laws are controlling idiots.", "NTA the judgmental MIL sounds controlling and wants to keep face with people at church. Is your sister really happy marrying into that kind of family? MIL sounds awful. It doesn\u2019t make sense to demote you to bridesmaid as you\u2019ll still be up there together.", "NTA buuuut tell your sister when this goes horribly wrong (because it will if they are already letting MIL control the MOH) you will be there for her like she was there for you.", "NTA and I cannot believe your sister is putting up with this horseshit. Who the fuck are those people to judge you? I think you've made the right decision. In fact I would think twice about attending, myself, but yanno, I'm that way.", "I don't know what church your sister is becoming part of but I do not know a single CHristian denomination that condemns a woman for divorcing a spouse for infidelity.\n\nNot one.\n\nNTA", "Another vote for keep your kids out.  You do not need those awful people saying any of that garbage to your kids.\n\nShame on your sister and double shame on that useless wimp she is marrying.  He is a complete mommas boy.  Gonna be a wild ride.", "NTA, financing for the wedding or not, your sister should have had your back, not stabbed you in it.", "Well, now I won't tell you not to go at all because it would be like giving in to those bigots who will soon rule your twin's life, but when you are there, pay close attention to your daughters, it could become a toxic environment for them too because they will be however the daughters of a divorced couple.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable in the wedding party especially since they\u2019ve included conditions that require you to lie about your marital situation and omit any mention of your health/ recovery. God forbid you slip the FMIL will not take it lightly. Feels like more pressure not less.", "NTA, but MIL is a massive fucking one. Such a \u201cgood Christian\u201d. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "NTA I\u2019m Catholic and that\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve heard regarding being part of a wedding party. I would have pulled out too. And frankly your sister by not standing up for you just altered your relationship for something incredibly dumb.", "NTA. You're an angel for not pulling your children out, as I definitely would have. \n\nAs a completely separate note, because I'm overly curious about nonsense and I will admit to ignorance on this: if you and your sister are identical twins, does that mean she is bipolar, too?", "NTA.\n\nBummer you can't walk on water with the rest of their perfect sin-free souls & pitch granite from atop your own glass mansion, but hey, the wings are better on the ground with the rest if us mere mortals.", "NTA Do you know what I would have done if my husband said I couldn't have my BFF as my MOH? Not married him!! Your twin is an AH and these ILs will only continue to control her.", "NTA - I agree with other comments that this is a weird religious response by new in laws. A shame your sister has such AH new MIL, she is so not going to have fun with his side of the family. My advice is to avoid the in laws at all cost & love & forgive your sister when you can. I know weddings are a big deal, but hold onto your \u2018no thank you!\u2019 to being demoted - take care of yourself OP!", "NTA. What Nathaniel Hawthorne novel did these people crawl out of??? I have an identical twin, and if I was given that same ultimatum, I would scale down my wedding to the 40% not paid for by the in-laws and make everyone declare \u201cDIVORCE IS NOT A CRIME\u201d at the door to gain entry.", "I am sorry this happened to you. I pity your sister; she is allowing others to control one of the most important days in her life and allowing her own family to be hurt in the process. It doesn't sound very promising for the married couple's future if the in-laws are so judgmental and controlling now.\n\nI don't blame you for not wanting to be in the wedding party when you have been judged not good enough to be the MOH. I don't blame you at all for being offended and refusing to be relegated to a lesser role. NTA", "NTA at all. I feel sad for you, OP. What a terrible thing for your sister to do. I was raised Catholic - they are some of the most judgmental, hypocritical of the bunch. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d attend or allow my children to be in this wedding if I were you, but definitely give that some more time to think about. \n\nYou should send your sister this post when you\u2019re willing to talk to her. Her in-laws are being extremely controlling and she is either too naive or ignorant to see it.", "NTA and I guarantee a few years after this wedding your sister will have a strain in her marriage. Any relationship that forces you to compromise on a fundamental  relationship will have long term problems. Your sister needs to realize this is a wedding! One day she will remember forever a celebration of her love and relationship. That will be tainted with this bull!", "You are such a strong woman, you have overcome so much and you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, his parents and you sister and brother in law should be ashamed of themselves. I\u2019m sorry your sister didn\u2019t stick up for you, you deserve better. I wish you nothing but happiness. Obviously NTA", "NTA. The Catholic church has no rules about divorced people as wedding attendants so no idea what MILs problem is. \n\nI'd go LC with sis because she's putting up with this. MIL shouldn't be able to decide MoH", "NTA ugh what a bunch of bullshit!", "NTA. This is incredibly hurtful and rude. I\u2019d also yank my kids out, too. If they can\u2019t respect their you as the girls\u2019 mother, your sister\u2019s in-laws don\u2019t need to be around your daughters.", "NTA but don\u2019t worry too much, sounds like an unhealthy relationship\u2026might even end in divorce.", "NTA - the mental gymnastics that have happened here are beyond my comprehension! How is being a divorce  bridesmaid more acceptable than a divorced maid of honour? Does your sister really think that it'll be less stressful for you to attend the wedding knowing that his family & their church believe your rightful place is in hell because your husband left you?", "NTA, it is not your fault that your ex is a coward and a deadbeat. idk where they think they can get off on saying you will ruin their wedding just because you're divorced. if someone told me that I wouldn't even bother going to the wedding if my presence is such a disturbance. I also suggest going low contact with your sister for a while.   \n\n\none last thing go out there and find a good man to actually take care of you so you can be happy. your single now so enjoy it and get back into the dating game.", "NTA, not even a little.  I am not usually one to say \"show your sister this thread\" but I think maybe sending a link along with something like \"My decision stands and I won't change my mind but I do love you and I am afraid if I try explain all the red flags here that you will think I am just upset and I am sure Jon is spinning the \"oh they are my parents, they want what's best for us line\", but I am actually concerned for your future marriage if you give your in laws so much control, so I am sending you this so you can see it's not just me being upset\" now it may backfire but either way your relationship has changed now so \ud83e\udd37", "NTA\n\nOh, that's just awful! I'm so sorry this has happened, and honestly, I would pull your daughters out of the wedding as well. You don't want her FMIL making snide remarks about them being children of divorce, and they sound old school enough that it's certainly a possibility. \n\nYou're not overreacting at all. I would stay NC with both of them for awhile.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d pull my kids from it too. And I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t be going at all!", "NTA\n\nHonestly, your sister NEEDS you to pull out. This isn't just her in laws. This is also her husband. She needs to realize that they are making completely unreasonable demands. Under no circumstances should they feel entitled to veto the bride's choice of MOH. It doesn't matter if they're footing 100% of the bill. It's not their place. \n\nYour sister would be better off with a small ceremony on her own terms than getting jerked around on her in-law's whims.\n\nHopefully you pulling out will be the wakeup call she needs to stand up for herself.", "NTA. How utterly cruel and back- stabbing your sister and her new husband are. How hypocritical, nasty and self- righteous. I would send your sister the link to this post and tell her to read the comments and be ashamed of herself. \n\nYou went through hell and got shamed for being divorced? If anyone expected me to exclude my sister because she is divorced, I would not marry this person.\nPlease don't attend the wedding at all, not even as guest. It is a wedding between nasty persons in a church that requires nastiness.", "NTA - that is beyond ridiculous and your sister should be ashamed for letting her in laws systems roll her. She will love to regret that decision. As far as divorce and church- King Charles and his now wife are both divorced and yet he is the head of a church so that whole antiquated reasoning is DOA.", "NTA. And she is stuck with Jon and MIL for life. Because they will never allow a divorce.", "NTA and the person who stands to lose the most is Stella. She has allowed her husband and his family to steamroll over her relationship with you. I'm not sure that you will ever forget this betrayal even if you do forgive her. \n\nAs a bit of a background I also come from a conservative religious community and divorce is taboo, especially for women. This has resulted in women being forced to stay in abusive marriages because they have no family and community support. The saying is that it's better to have a dead daughter than a divorced daughter. Yes, it's literally what community members say! It seems that your sister's in laws would be happier if you were being abused and not getting treatment!!!\n\nYour sister is marrying a man who is more concerned about appearances and pleasing his family rather than her feelings and her family relationships. What kind of husband and father will he be? If his children don't meet his expectations, how will he treat them? It doesn't even have to be a so called major issue, like if their child is gay or trans. \n\nYou should stand your ground and not attend the wedding nor should your daughters participate. Your sister and her fianc\u00e9 have shown you exactly how little you and your children mean to them.", "NTA- what in the hillbilly conservative BS is this? is your sister so desperate to get married she's willing to throw away everything?  Appalling behaviour  on her part.  \n\n\nWhat have your parents said?", "NTA Jon and his family are pseudo-Catholics who are ignoring major teachings: judge not and love they neighbour.\n\nI\u2019d say give yourself a moment but talk to your sister. You both sound strong and incredible women and whilst life is hectic a bond like yours and your sisters shouldn\u2019t be. You both truly love each other.

It seems like your sister got sucked into her future in-laws ridiculous bigotry and can\u2019t see how incredibly hurtful and prejudiced this is. Sadly most people who pride themselves in their Christianity don\u2019t seem to have anything in common with their praised gods son.

I wouldn\u2019t want to be in the wedding either. The fact that it seems like your sister doesn\u2019t understand why you feel this way and  doesn\u2019t even seem to be standing up for you says a lot.\n \nIn regards to your kids, I definitely understand not pulling them out, it\u2019s not fair to pull them out of something because of an issue YOU are dealing with. I will say that based off their ages (especially the 3 year old) they may get nervous on the actual wedding day and run to you instead of walking down the aisle (I say this as this happened with my sisters kids who are around the same age as yours) but that\u2019s kind of expected and is an sweet moment in the middle of the wedding. \n\nAt the end of the day, your sister can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t force you to be a member of the bridal party and should respect your decision.", "NTA \n\nDitch the wedding and take your kids out from the wedding..you never know how these high almighty holy rollers might treat your children.

Sorry, where forgiveness is an alien concept, replaced by bigotry, judgement and hatred.\n\nYou are well shot of them OP but it may be a bit too soon to criticise your sister.

I tried but who am I trying to kid? It seems your sister has accepted her lot of joining his family's cult and you'd do well to distance yourself from the lot of them.\n\nIt must be particularly hard for you to see your sister in this new light and I have no doubt you will need a period of adjustment to review and reconsider the kind of person your sister is, or has become.\n\nNTA in any way, shape or form.

Honestly, I'm sure she fell in love with him for a reason, but I am so sorry your lovely sister got wrapped up with a guy like Jon.

We both know the reason for my divorce and the incredible pain my husband's infidelity caused not only me but my daughters. His actions blew up my world.
