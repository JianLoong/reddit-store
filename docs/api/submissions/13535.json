We hugged like usual but Jon didn't. Weirder.\n\nAfter we got our drinks, they got to it. In a nutshell, Jon expressed the following: \"Despite my best efforts to keep it secret, my parents found out that you're divorced when they asked why your husband wasn't coming.

I don't even want to know what Jon thinks at this point.\n\nPlease help me. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the responses. I half expected to be told to just put up with it and be a plain bridesmaid, which while difficult I kinda would have forced myself to just to make Stella happy. I was just so blindsided and I feel like I've been gut-punched, and I do need to be told if I am overreacting in a big way sometimes.\n\nI'm going to fall asleep now while binging Friends. And wonder if my twin has suddenly become an Ursula instead of Phoebe...\n\nEdit 2: Wow. I did not expect this to blow up. I can't thank everyone enough for their input.\n\nI have a call scheduled with my parents this afternoon (from what I gathered, they are extremely upset with Stella and Jon at the moment) Depending on how that goes, I will talk to my girls about doing something big and fun instead. The more I think about it, sitting through a mass sounds less and less appealing. I'm not even religious.\n\nAnd I saw this query in the comments... yes, I had a cocktail with no alcohol. I use the word mocktail but I guess its meaning is still lost to some people.

Good thing you noped out because I have a funny feeling you won't be the only one if MIL is controlling this from behind the scenes.", "NTA \n\nHonestly I wouldn\u2019t let the kids be in this wedding either, they don\u2019t need to be subjected to the in laws high and mighty attitude.", "Yikes.\n\nNTA, be prepared for your sister's in-laws to try to push you out of her life, because its already starting.", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised your sister didn\u2019t have your back.", "NTA.  You have been judged not worthy by your sister's soon-to-be husband and in-laws, and so, in a sense, they are the ones making this decision for you.  By the mere fact that you still want to attend as a guest shows that you are not making this decision lightly or out of spite.\n\nBest of luck to you and I feel very sorry for your sister who is marrying an extremely judgmental fiance with parents even worse.  There are many Catholics that are not like this, and for those that are, it seems to be the exact opposite of what Jesus would have wanted.", "Nta. Shes bending to the will of inlaws who are footing the bill and now  believe they have some power over decisions.  She should've stand by you as her identical sister. IMO.", "NTA.   A low blow.   Just because his parents are paying for the majority of the wedding it doesn't give them the right to dictate who is and isn't the MOH that is your SISTERS choice.   Just like it's her choice in what she wears on the big day.  I think you are dealing with it really well.   You are allowing your girls to still be in the wedding and you are still attending the wedding as a guest.   \n\nIf your sister wants to allow her future in laws to dictate her life that's her choice, but it's not yours and good for you for sticking up for yourself but still choosing to be there for her on her big day.   I'm not sure I would be able to", "NTA!!  Not even a little bit.  You handled the situation far better than most people would!  Do NOT let your sister or your parents bully you about this.  You need to do what is best for your own mental health.  Being downgraded from MOH is humiliating, and everyone in your family will know something is wrong.  I bet your sister hasn't even thought about that, she's so worried about making MIL like her!\n\nHonestly, your sister should be grateful you're still willing to attend the wedding at all.  It's beyond gracious of you to allow your daughters to still be flower girls, but unless you've already promised it to them you might want to reconsider.  If MIL is that judgmental, you don't know what she'll say about, in front of, or directly to your daughters.  I wouldn't trust her around them, personally.", "NTA \n\nI am so sorry, you must be crushed. This feels like a major betrayal to me, and it's not my sister. \n\nYour sister *knows* why you are divorced. Your husband was unfaithful. That is a legitimate reason to divorce even in most fundy churches. \n\nJon could have just told his parents that your husband left you. He didn't have to mention divorce. He knew this was going to be an issue for his parents. Maybe he shares their views since he was the one to speak. \n\nThis is all about there parents image which is ridiculous. \n\nI can't believe your sister tried to put a \"good\" spin on it. Holy crap. \n\nGood on you for keeping your cool and not dumping the cocktail on their heads.", "I was totally prepared to be on the other side, but you are absolutely NTA. Your sister sacrificed you in lieu of her future in-laws judgmental religious choices, and the fact that she allowed it blows my mind. You\u2019re not overreacting.

Jon\u2019s family doesn\u2019t have a single clue as to what it means to be a true Catholic either. There\u2019s absolutely no way they should be behaving like this-it\u2019s controlling. Your sister possibly appears to be coerced into this based on her FILs paying for the wedding. Before making this decision, I would be asking her if this is what she really wants or if she\u2019s being forced into it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nHer future husband and in-laws are using money to control her and that really sucks. Especially since she\u2019s just complicit with it.", "I feel like you know you are NTA but if you need reassurance, then please consider this it.", "I can\u2019t even. Really, I just can\u2019t. No OP, you are not in the wrong and I think you are being remarkably kind by attending and letting your kids participate because I honestly don\u2019t have that kind of goodness in me. Kudos to you for being the bigger, better person. NTA", "NTA\u2026obligatory \u201cweddings seem to bring out the worst in people\u201d.", "NTA\n\nI grew up in a family with similar values to your sisters in-laws. To me it sounds like your sister is marrying into an extremely controlling family, and likely does not have strong boundaries. She asked you to be her MOH originally- so I would bet that IS what she actually wants (Try to take some small comfort in that), and she IS probably genuinely upset at the thought of you not being in the wedding at all (at least IMO). However, she has chosen to bend to her in laws demands instead of sticking up for her own wants/needs, and she has hurt you in the process. Whatever her reasoning, the fact remains \u2014 Your sister could have chosen to stand up to her in laws and refuse to remove you as MOH due to your divorce \u2014 an action she had to know would hurt you. **When she chose to prioritize her in laws demands, it naturally had consequences. That consequence is that she hurt you deeply, and thus you no longer want to be in her wedding party.** You are allowed to feel that way (I would too!). I would bet this is not the response your sister expected, and now she is panicking and blowing you up because this isn\u2019t the ending she anticipated. However, thats not your problem or fault. **She made choices and now has to live with the consequences of her own actions. Your hurt is justified and so is your decision to drop out of the wedding party .**\n\nAlso for what it\u2019s worth - I think the fact that your sister knows how extremely difficult your divorce was for you makes her decision even more horrible. Being divorced does not mean there is anything wrong with you, it is nothing to be ashamed of. Sisters fianc\u00e9 and his family are all sorts of problematic. Serious \ud83d\udea9energy. Avoid them as much as you can in the future. \n\n**bottom line**: while your sister is within her rights to change MOHs, you also are within your rights to be (understandably) very upset and decide you do not want to be in the wedding party anymore. You did NOTHING wrong. Your sisters in laws are controlling.", "NTA the judgmental MIL sounds controlling and wants to keep face with people at church. Is your sister really happy marrying into that kind of family? MIL sounds awful. It doesn\u2019t make sense to demote you to bridesmaid as you\u2019ll still be up there together.", "NTA buuuut tell your sister when this goes horribly wrong (because it will if they are already letting MIL control the MOH) you will be there for her like she was there for you.", "NTA and I cannot believe your sister is putting up with this horseshit. Who the fuck are those people to judge you? I think you've made the right decision. In fact I would think twice about attending, myself, but yanno, I'm that way.", "I don't know what church your sister is becoming part of but I do not know a single CHristian denomination that condemns a woman for divorcing a spouse for infidelity.\n\nNot one.\n\nNTA", "Another vote for keep your kids out.  You do not need those awful people saying any of that garbage to your kids.\n\nShame on your sister and double shame on that useless wimp she is marrying.  He is a complete mommas boy.  Gonna be a wild ride.", "NTA, financing for the wedding or not, your sister should have had your back, not stabbed you in it.", "Well, now I won't tell you not to go at all because it would be like giving in to those bigots who will soon rule your twin's life, but when you are there, pay close attention to your daughters, it could become a toxic environment for them too because they will be however the daughters of a divorced couple.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable in the wedding party especially since they\u2019ve included conditions that require you to lie about your marital situation and omit any mention of your health/ recovery. God forbid you slip the FMIL will not take it lightly. Feels like more pressure not less.", "NTA, but MIL is a massive fucking one. Such a \u201cgood Christian\u201d. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "NTA I\u2019m Catholic and that\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve heard regarding being part of a wedding party. I would have pulled out too. And frankly your sister by not standing up for you just altered your relationship for something incredibly dumb.", "NTA. You're an angel for not pulling your children out, as I definitely would have. \n\nAs a completely separate note, because I'm overly curious about nonsense and I will admit to ignorance on this: if you and your sister are identical twins, does that mean she is bipolar, too?", "NTA.\n\nBummer you can't walk on water with the rest of their perfect sin-free souls & pitch granite from atop your own glass mansion, but hey, the wings are better on the ground with the rest if us mere mortals.", "NTA Do you know what I would have done if my husband said I couldn't have my BFF as my MOH? Not married him!! Your twin is an AH and these ILs will only continue to control her.", "NTA - I agree with other comments that this is a weird religious response by new in laws. A shame your sister has such AH new MIL, she is so not going to have fun with his side of the family. My advice is to avoid the in laws at all cost & love & forgive your sister when you can. I know weddings are a big deal, but hold onto your \u2018no thank you!\u2019 to being demoted - take care of yourself OP!", "NTA. What Nathaniel Hawthorne novel did these people crawl out of??? I have an identical twin, and if I was given that same ultimatum, I would scale down my wedding to the 40% not paid for by the in-laws and make everyone declare \u201cDIVORCE IS NOT A CRIME\u201d at the door to gain entry.", "I am sorry this happened to you. I pity your sister; she is allowing others to control one of the most important days in her life and allowing her own family to be hurt in the process. It doesn't sound very promising for the married couple's future if the in-laws are so judgmental and controlling now.\n\nI don't blame you for not wanting to be in the wedding party when you have been judged not good enough to be the MOH. I don't blame you at all for being offended and refusing to be relegated to a lesser role. NTA", "NTA at all. I feel sad for you, OP. What a terrible thing for your sister to do. I was raised Catholic - they are some of the most judgmental, hypocritical of the bunch. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d attend or allow my children to be in this wedding if I were you, but definitely give that some more time to think about. \n\nYou should send your sister this post when you\u2019re willing to talk to her. Her in-laws are being extremely controlling and she is either too naive or ignorant to see it.", "NTA and I guarantee a few years after this wedding your sister will have a strain in her marriage. Any relationship that forces you to compromise on a fundamental  relationship will have long term problems. Your sister needs to realize this is a wedding! One day she will remember forever a celebration of her love and relationship. That will be tainted with this bull!", "You are such a strong woman, you have overcome so much and you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, his parents and you sister and brother in law should be ashamed of themselves. I\u2019m sorry your sister didn\u2019t stick up for you, you deserve better. I wish you nothing but happiness. Obviously NTA", "NTA. The Catholic church has no rules about divorced people as wedding attendants so no idea what MILs problem is. \n\nI'd go LC with sis because she's putting up with this. MIL shouldn't be able to decide MoH", "NTA ugh what a bunch of bullshit!", "NTA. This is incredibly hurtful and rude. I\u2019d also yank my kids out, too. If they can\u2019t respect their you as the girls\u2019 mother, your sister\u2019s in-laws don\u2019t need to be around your daughters.", "NTA but don\u2019t worry too much, sounds like an unhealthy relationship\u2026might even end in divorce.", "NTA - the mental gymnastics that have happened here are beyond my comprehension! How is being a divorce  bridesmaid more acceptable than a divorced maid of honour? Does your sister really think that it'll be less stressful for you to attend the wedding knowing that his family & their church believe your rightful place is in hell because your husband left you?", "NTA, it is not your fault that your ex is a coward and a deadbeat. idk where they think they can get off on saying you will ruin their wedding just because you're divorced. if someone told me that I wouldn't even bother going to the wedding if my presence is such a disturbance. I also suggest going low contact with your sister for a while.   \n\n\none last thing go out there and find a good man to actually take care of you so you can be happy. your single now so enjoy it and get back into the dating game.", "NTA, not even a little.  I am not usually one to say \"show your sister this thread\" but I think maybe sending a link along with something like \"My decision stands and I won't change my mind but I do love you and I am afraid if I try explain all the red flags here that you will think I am just upset and I am sure Jon is spinning the \"oh they are my parents, they want what's best for us line\", but I am actually concerned for your future marriage if you give your in laws so much control, so I am sending you this so you can see it's not just me being upset\" now it may backfire but either way your relationship has changed now so \ud83e\udd37", "NTA\n\nOh, that's just awful! I'm so sorry this has happened, and honestly, I would pull your daughters out of the wedding as well. You don't want her FMIL making snide remarks about them being children of divorce, and they sound old school enough that it's certainly a possibility. \n\nYou're not overreacting at all. I would stay NC with both of them for awhile.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019d pull my kids from it too. And I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t be going at all!", "NTA\n\nHonestly, your sister NEEDS you to pull out. This isn't just her in laws. This is also her husband. She needs to realize that they are making completely unreasonable demands. Under no circumstances should they feel entitled to veto the bride's choice of MOH. It doesn't matter if they're footing 100% of the bill. It's not their place. \n\nYour sister would be better off with a small ceremony on her own terms than getting jerked around on her in-law's whims.\n\nHopefully you pulling out will be the wakeup call she needs to stand up for herself.", "NTA. How utterly cruel and back- stabbing your sister and her new husband are. How hypocritical, nasty and self- righteous. I would send your sister the link to this post and tell her to read the comments and be ashamed of herself. \n\nYou went through hell and got shamed for being divorced? If anyone expected me to exclude my sister because she is divorced, I would not marry this person.\nPlease don't attend the wedding at all, not even as guest. It is a wedding between nasty persons in a church that requires nastiness.", "NTA - that is beyond ridiculous and your sister should be ashamed for letting her in laws systems roll her. She will love to regret that decision. As far as divorce and church- King Charles and his now wife are both divorced and yet he is the head of a church so that whole antiquated reasoning is DOA.", "NTA. And she is stuck with Jon and MIL for life. Because they will never allow a divorce.", "NTA and the person who stands to lose the most is Stella. She has allowed her husband and his family to steamroll over her relationship with you. I'm not sure that you will ever forget this betrayal even if you do forgive her. \n\nAs a bit of a background I also come from a conservative religious community and divorce is taboo, especially for women. This has resulted in women being forced to stay in abusive marriages because they have no family and community support. The saying is that it's better to have a dead daughter than a divorced daughter. Yes, it's literally what community members say! It seems that your sister's in laws would be happier if you were being abused and not getting treatment!!!\n\nYour sister is marrying a man who is more concerned about appearances and pleasing his family rather than her feelings and her family relationships. What kind of husband and father will he be? If his children don't meet his expectations, how will he treat them? It doesn't even have to be a so called major issue, like if their child is gay or trans. \n\nYou should stand your ground and not attend the wedding nor should your daughters participate. Your sister and her fianc\u00e9 have shown you exactly how little you and your children mean to them.", "NTA- what in the hillbilly conservative BS is this? is your sister so desperate to get married she's willing to throw away everything?  Appalling behaviour  on her part.  \n\n\nWhat have your parents said?", "NTA Jon and his family are pseudo-Catholics who are ignoring major teachings: judge not and love they neighbour.\n\nI\u2019d say give yourself a moment but talk to your sister. You both sound strong and incredible women and whilst life is hectic a bond like yours and your sisters shouldn\u2019t be. You both truly love each other.

They've treated you awfully, and I'm so sorry. If I were you, I wouldn't let my kids be in the wedding either, and possibly not go at all \n\nThat said, if you want to salvage your relationship with your sister, you might want to try speaking to her (alone, without the husband to be , and the inlaws). Explain how this has made you feel, and that it's not the fact that she wants a different MOH that's bothering you, it's the fact that it's her inlaws that have decided you're unsuitable because of things which are mainly outside your control, and she has taken their side by not standing up for you (and then trying to spin it as a positive!!).\nMaybe remind her it's her wedding, not her inlaws, and they shouldn't have to \"approve\" anything, especially not the MOH or bridesmaids, who should be there to support the bride (and so should be chosen by the bride). \n\nI really hope, both for you and your sister, that she pulls herself together and notices how badly she's treated you and how awful her inlaws are and apologises to you (properly). But if not, at least you'll know where you stand, and the ball will be in her court. \n\nAgain, I'm so sorry this has happened to you!", "NTA you are letting people have access to your kids, with no respect or relationship to their mother. That is a line you need to draw in the sand. Withdraw your kids from the wedding.", "NTA Honestly I agree with others - I wouldnt go and pull the kids.  If you have to go make sure you introduce your self as the brides divorced sister to as many of his family as possible including the priest,", "NTA. Pull the kids and don\u2019t attend.

I\u2019m horrified he didn\u2019t greet you and that your sister is marrying into this. The idea you are supposed to not mention your divorce or \u201cconditions\u201d?! WTAF? No. This is awful.", "NTA.\n\nShe knows you, everything about you and is allowing her soon to be husband and his family already dictate such horrible things, if I were her, I'd be judging my own choices in my soon to be husband and his family.\n\nI'd honestly start including some boundaries between you and her, it'll cause you heartache now but less in the future. You must think of yourself, and not what people have done for you.", "NTA\n\nPersonally, I would just not go to the wedding. Your life circumstances are not grounds to pull this.\n\nYou were in a bad situation and found a way out. That's EXTREMELY commendable, and anyone acting otherwise is TA.", "NTA - you did the correct thing.  If you weren't good enough to be MOH, why would you be 'bridesmaid' !  Who is this woman that your life is for her to judge !!\n\nI would go to the wedding - just so that this wicked future MIL can't be the boss of your life.  Your sister should have put her foot down and said 'Its my wedding and this is my identical sister' .  The person who has the power in that marriage are the grooms parents and your sister will have to dance to their tune for the rest of her life.\n\nYou're better off - say you support her , even though she is joining this cult like group of religious and judgemental zealots.\n\nLet your daughters be flower girls.  There is power in a small girl with a dress and they will enjoy the occasion!\n\nYou can tell people that 'You 'found out' that the MIL is a dried up bitter and judgmental person who probably voted for Trump twice !!!'", "NTA.

Also, your sister is about to get into a controlling marriage.", "NTA but why are your kids still in the wedding party? His family certainly don't seem to care about your stillbirth or ex betraying his wife and family for the affair only that you got a divorce. Bunch of hypocrites.", "First off I'm sorry this is happening.    Secondly, is his family not aware that the Catholic church has changed (albeit slowly)? They allow divorced people to darken the sanctuary now. However, the biggest issue is your sister allowing his family to take control like that. This is foreshadowing for her future with them. You are NTA and have every right to pull out of the wedding.

What boggles me the most is why on earth your sisters husband or his family can dictate so much about what she wants! Ask her who matters her the most.

It's awful your sister is choosing this stance over you. Agreeing with it. It's just awful. She does not realise that this can negatively affect your relationship with her forever. I hope it does recover but I would recommend dont sweep under the rug just to make her feel better or to avoid family drama.\nYou deserve an apology. A sincere one.", "Jesus, you need a time machine to attend this wedding. F those people.", "NTA \nBut your sister and her in-laws are.

Who the hell are these in-laws that they get to approve or disapprove anyone.   Your sister should have stood up for you.", "NTA. Wow. I'm so sorry OP.\n\nDo his parents understand that about 50% of marriages end in divorce? Why are his parents choosing who can be in your sister's wedding party? If the parents are this controlling before the wedding begins, I can't imagine what they will be like 10 years down the road.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that they also said you can't be a MOH due to your \"conditions\" is appalling. They don't care that you're in recovery and in a much better place, they are stigmatizing mental health and addiction because it \"doesn't look good\" (as if the catholic church has a good image anyways).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so sorry. Take care of yourself and hopefully your twin comes to her senses and realizes how little control she has in her own wedding.", "I am always amazed when the perfect wedding celebration (obviously too expensive to pay alone) seems to be more important than the people you would want to celebrate with.\n\nNTA.

Your sister\u2019s future in laws sound like jerks.", "NTA and I am honestly baffled why you'd attend the wedding all together. So your sister and your FBIL knew that you're divorced for some very good reasons - yet they agree with the FMIL's opinion of excluding you bc you are divorced? \n\nTwin or not I'd stay away from the wedding - I couldn't imagine being that cruel to a friend, yet your twin sister decided to be cruel towards you. \n\nAs for your girls - I'd honestly think about letting them be flower girls - I understand that they're excited but I'd bring them for the flower part and take them with me immediately after they finished their duty.", "I would honestly cancel the wedding rather than do this to my sister.

If she lets them decide who is in her bridal party, that will just be the start of their power over her. \n\nA full Mass is OTT as well. They sound like a family who put their religion before treating others in a charitable way.", "NTA. So your sister is putting her husband's family's religious values above her own family? She's either fallen so far off the deep end or she's being religiously coerced, in which case she needs an intervention. I'd ask your sister to ask the inlaws to be sure there's no infidelity on their part, otherwise the marriage can't go ahead as it wouldn't be right in the eyes of the church.", "NTA - for a start, it sounds like the in laws are in complete control of the wedding, given you mentioned the caveat about having to have the wedding at their church. That's blackmail and really shitty behaviour. And for them to need to give approval or rejection of the MOH? Who's wedding is it? Sounds like your sister's priorities aren't right either. Your own sister....if she cared about you, she'd have fought this to keep you as MOH.\n\nI'd be pulling the kids out too...dispicable behaviour from your own sister....and those in laws sound like disgusting human beings.", "NTA, but you will be if you don't pull your daughters from the wedding too. Your sister's fianc\u00e9 and in-laws do not get to judge your past because of their beliefs and still get to use your daughters for their wedding. Tell your sister you're not coming, pull your daughters, and go on vacation the weekend of the wedding.", "NTA\n\nOuch.  This one hurts.  Your feelings are totally valid.  What she did... it was mean.  It is hurtful and doesn't speak well of her that she would sell you out for a single flashy wedding day.  That sucks.  But if she is dealing with fiance demands and in-law demands, and got overwhelmed and made a bad choice to go along with them - ugh, fine.  I wouldn't like it.  Istill would not agree to be a bridesmaid.  Frankly, I probably wouldn't go, because while she may be kowtowing to inlaws, I really don't like to be told I need to hide away in shame.  But fine.  \n\nBut then she should come to you, in tears about the position she is in, that her FIANCE put her in.  Instead, she came and told you that you should be happy about this, and you were overreacting.  That is flat out gaslighting.  She KNOWS this is wrong.  And she told you that YOUR pain inconveniences her.  Just... ouch.\n\nThe fact that she already lined up the new MOH.  That she had her fiance tell you this.  That he was cold with you, and then acted as though you were somehow someone to be ashamed of.  That SHE acted as though you were someone she had to hide.\n\nIt's all a lot to take from someone you trusted.\n\nI'm sorry, OP.  As someone who is VERY close to my sister, this would be such a crack in our relationship.  I don't know how you come back from this.  It's such a betrayal.", "NTA. Ouch.

They\u2019ve made her in-laws the priority and you\u2026 not a priority.\n\nThe screwy part is where she expects you to accommodate this bs. Spinning it like a good thing, asking you not to make this harder, treating your reaction like it\u2019s not warranted. She\u2019s twisted herself into a pretzel and doesn\u2019t even realize it. Expects everyone else to do the same. That\u2019s bizarre.\n\nGood for you for asserting yourself. You\u2019re not a puppet. I can\u2019t believe she just thought you\u2019d go along. That\u2019s apparently her style. But not yours\u2026 which is a good thing.\n\nMy big question is: What happens if they have a gay kid? Or a kid with a mental illness? Is Stella going to stand up for that kid, or are the in-laws going to steamroll everyone with their judgmental bs, and she\u2019ll be siding with them instead of standing up for what\u2019s right? Her behavior now is an indicator of her character.\n\nThis situation may isolate Stella from you and her other loved ones. Could make it harder if she ever decides she wants out.

Infidelity is a big no no, something Jesus among others directly calls out. Your husband has sinned gravely, but you, even though divorced, have not. \n\nOn top of that your future in-laws have all sinned against you for being such judgmental assholes.

Honeymoon suite in an old house that had been converted to a duplex. Checkin was a few blocks away at a youth hostel. The memories might be a little fuzzy because it was FORTY FRICKIN\u2019 YEARS AGO! A big wedding does not make a strong marriage.

Their defense mechanism is to deny it entirely or blame some other extraneous cause, other than their parenting, of course.

So your comment recognizes that the Catholic Church does not equal a government - the end of a marriage essentially needs to be filed separately in each place (the Earthly government and with God's secretary, apparently). Each person can only ever have ONE (valid) marriage in the eyes of God. This matters a lot because that's the person you'll spend eternity married to, once you're in Heaven and there are no take-backsies.\n\nTherefore, when a Catholic person's marriage ends for Earthly reasons, they need to find a reason to explain to God why the marriage actually, in fact, never counted at all. (And the reasons very rarely align with what an Earthly government would believe.)\n\nFor example: My mother married a Catholic guy whose family really wanted them to be married in a church. BUT, the guy had been married before and got divorced (for the usual reasons - they were like 19 and dumb). With a divorce on his record, the guy would have been free to get a courthouse marriage or get married anywhere else *except a Catholic church*. The solution? He told the priest that his first wife was into candles and crystals and stuff, so the first marriage was annulled due to ***witchcraft***. Very literally, this first wife didn't do anything wrong and he was forced by church rules to have her officially declared a witch in the eyes of God. In 1986. \n\nThe marriage to my mom lasted 3 years and resulted in a child, so as far as I know it was never annulled - that would have invalidated their child/made them illegitimate and the Very Catholic Grandparents wanted to eventually see their grandchild in Heaven, obviously. The guy's third marriage was secular (and has lasted the longest).", "NTA. When it comes down to it, the bride asked you to take a role in her wedding. You are uncomfortable with the role as described. That's it. \n\nIf we are going to put a positive spin on this, tell your sister that she no longer needs to worry about the facts of your divorce slipping out during the preparations, the ceremony, or reception. See, less stress for her!\n\nI think it is OK to let your daughters remain flower girls. They are too young to understand the drama and did not do anything wrong.\n\nFair warning: if your sister goes through with this marriage, her husband will see to it that your sister spends less and less time interacting with you and your children. The fact that she went along with despite the fact she so obviously disagrees does not bode well.", "NTA - As a former Catholic, people in the church understand divorces happen and I\u2019ve never run into a Catholic that acted like this about divorce.  I\u2019ve had family go through the whole annulment process in the church for similar reasons you divorced for.  This sounds like a made up reason because she didn\u2019t want you MoH for some other reason.", "NTA, the rumors will happen even if you were just a MOH and your FBiL sucks and I feel bad for your sister.

Because he didn't want her to think that he agreed. Because that's what it would be. By keeping you out from the MOH position for your divorce (what else were you supposed to do ? Suffer in silence for the rest in your life in a terrible marriage) your sister is telling you that you are shamefull. And that her futur IL slight \"discomfort\" for one friggin day is more important than you. I would be completely pissed in your position and reevaluating my relationship.", "NTA.

He is a pretty selfish prig and that is what she wants to marry?  She allowed him to say that to you. Someone who said that to you after losing a child and catching your husband cheating.  Literally the one \"acceptable\" religious reason God says you can divorce is adultery. I would not allow my child to be near him or any part of this wedding, people who have that strong of a reaction to divorce generally don't treat the kids of the divorced person any better - in fact they tend to mistreat children.  But that is your call, but I would keep an eye on the situation during the wedding and pictures.\n\nYou don't owe her your time or any kind of explanation. Block her for as long as you need.  You did nothing wrong and if you don't want to be a part of the wedding then stick with that.  The only reason she is trying to get you to do what her future husband wants is because he is a control freak bigot, along with his mother and if they can make you do this - they will score a win because they effectively punished you for being divorced.  This is a put you in your place and if you don't go along with it then it will be very likely people will ask why you are not part of the wedding party - which means they then have to share with people what their actions were that led to this.  They probably know their actions are not gonna go over well so now they are trying to force the issue.\n\nI have some pretty devote family in the Catholic, Baptist, Jewish groups and other religions and I have heard some stupid things being said or exchanged on occasion because of the differences, However, never anything of that nature would ever cross any of our mouths. We have agnostics, atheists and Pagans too.  To say Thanksgiving dinner can get interesting is a Fact.  But we don't get rude like that to one another, and we don't single out anyone who has been thru divorce, loss of child or a spouse's adultery as something to use as a weapon to hurt our own family.  We have had all three and that is just wrong on all levels - there is no God who would be ok with that behavior - that is some self-important moron excusing his horrible actions with the cover of God.    That audacity is Huge.", "Hmmm \u2026 you were replaced by her BFF. What exactly makes you think this is truly about religion and not about your sister just wanting to have someone else important to her as her MOH? You give your sister a lot of credit.

These people are just being assholes.\n\n(Also, this isn't an endorsement of those rules; I think they actually really suck and prohibitions on divorce lead to people staying in abusive situations much longer than they would otherwise because they fear the stigma and social ostracization, and even if it's not abusive, people shouldn't only stay in a marriage because they fear almighty retribution if they leave and move on to someone else.)", "I'm Catholic - the church doesn't care that they're divorced, they just don't recognise it. So, you're still \"in communion\" with the church even if you're divorced - but if you started seeing someone else, they'd see that as adultery, since to them your marriage is still valid. \n\nHaving said that, noone gives a rats ass about the marital status of a non-catholic guest!", "I was in a Catholic wedding party, and am Catholic.  Well, raised Catholic, but never a believer.\n\nAnyway, not doing Communion.  So I asked the priest how to gracefully avoid it during the mass.

We went to an Evengelical church (basically Catholic lite but we hated actual catholics) and my mom was talking to my dad in the car about how \"dissapointed\" she was in one of the fellow church goers and how she was \"worried for her soul\". The reason? The poor woman was a mother to 2 kids and the father cheated on her and left, it had been around a year and they had been separated for some time at that point and the woman started dating someone. My mom believed she was living in sin because she was still technically married. I was 9 and I knew that was bullshit.", "Tbh I\u2019m worried about your sister marrying this man and into his family.

I can\u2019t tell you what to do about your children being in the wedding. But I can say I think it\u2019s kind and brave of you to still say you would attend the wedding as a guest. Which tbh is another issue. Are there rules in place for that too? Or for all of the guest not to speak of any outdated taboo subjects.

They had to prove his first wife was Catholic and married outside the Catholic church to invalidate his first marriage. If they were both non-Catholic and married in their own religion the Church would have required an annulment. It's weird, but OP would only be excused if she or her ex were Catholic and they were married in a non-Catholic ceremony. \n\nThat being said, OP, your twin should strongly reconsider the family she is marrying into. This kind of abuse will not stop at the wedding. NTA.", "Basically the Church recognizes any type of official marriage (from any type of religion or even just the government) as valid.

Lol", "It's been almost 15 years since I went through the process,  and in not Christian anymore, so I don't know if the whole priestly trial thing still exists.

Please let them know they have one chance to walk back what they've done before I consider it fair game to discuss the kind of people they are publicly.\"\n\nGive it a week, and then follow through. Go talk to the priest at their church about their behavior, and how concerning it is to you. Ask him for help in correcting it, since isolating people from their families is what abusers do. If it lasts until the wedding, talk to anyone you're able on their side about how disappointing their actions have been, and that you really expected better from Jon's family.\n\nWhat they've done is absolutely reprehensible, and you are under absolutely no obligation to roll over and let them wreck your relationship with your sister.", "Wow, that really is a punch to the gut!  And one reason I'm not Catholic.  I just don't understand how this attitude is congruent with what Jesus taught us.  But, I digress.    \n\n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would ask her directly why she feels it's necessary for you to just suck up your feelings and be in her wedding party after already being told that you are not good enough to be her MOH because you now ex-husband betrayed your wedding vows and because the in-laws might be embarrassed, or find it a problem that your sister is not in the wedding party at all now that they have fully judged you for an issue, not of your making?  Why should you be so concerned about their feelings when they clearly have no issue with hurting yours? \n\nAnd if your BIL thinks it's acceptable to tell his Fiancee's TWIN all this, I would be concerned about what else would be coming down the pike. Are they going to limit you from family gatherings when the inlaws are present because of your mental health issues or your failed marriage? Are they going to make your kids feel less than others?  What's next on the agenda?  And WHY would they think you'd want to regale anyone with your traumas and issues at THEIR wedding and specifically ask you to avoid those topics?  If you don't regularly do such a thing at these kinds of important events, that to me is even more insulting overall as well. Not only are they blaming you for the trauma and resulting damage inflicted upon you, but they are also even implying you don't have the manners to behave well at the wedding and know that that would not be the proper place or time to discuss these things. VERY INSULTING. No wonder you had to leave!\n\n I think these people are outrageous for demanding such, and I don't really think that much of your sister or BIL to be for acquiescing either.  And please note, she had already worked out the \"problem\" by getting her \"BFF\" \"approved\" by the MIL BEFORE she even talked to you about this at all.  I think it is FAR BETTER for you to be only a guest ( if that) as the repeated insult of being made to feel not good enough through all the activities up to the wedding as a result of that MIL, would potentially be too stressful to deal with. And it could precipitate a recurrence of the depression.   Rejection like that is hard for anyone much less anyone who has been through what you have. u/twin_bridesmaid", "Wtf?

You do not need to do that for her sake.   \n\n\nDo not let your girls get used in creating a beautiful, fake wedding tapestry when literally the foundation of this marriage is alientation and rigid control - not love.  \n\n\nAlso, what are your parents thoughts on this whole situation?", "Info: How do you like Jon as a person? When you said that he said \"Despite his best efforts...\" I just felt off. Like how good is his best effort? Because honestly, I just feel like he might have outright told them you're divorced.", "The thing is though that based on the way they treated you they will most definitely look down on your kids and treat them the same way. And since you\u2019re not in the wedding party anymore there will be plenty of opportunities for them to mistreat your kids and you won\u2019t even know until it already happened. You\u2019re putting them into a toxic situation knowingly and more likely than not it\u2019s going to get them hurt and their aunt obviously isn\u2019t going to protect them if she didn\u2019t even try to protect and defend you.", "You're rewarding your sister and her fiance for their horrendous treatment of you.", "Ma'am, you are her twin. If they are willing to treat the twin sister of the bride like sidewalk poop, what makes you think they will treat your daughters, the children of divorced parents, any better? Pull your daughters out for the sake of their mental health. I wouldn't even attend the wedding because what they've told you loud and clear is that you are not welcome. They can't totally oust you from the wedding without looking like complete assholes, so they put conditions on you as a guest, because again, you're not actually welcome.", "Not to mention just how toxic they'll become if things go wrong and the marriage doesn't last until death.", "I love you", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I was just about to post that.", "With blackjack and hookers."]}
