Back then internet was harder to access so I would search a dictionary for whatever I couldn't understand at all or ask any classmate that already spoke English or that knew more than me. Subtitles can also help. \n\nIt took some time but eventually I was able to become fluent enough that I could hold a conversation and from there it was just about always asking for an explanation and definitions when I didn't know what a word meant.

Surrounding yourself with the language is the best way to learn", "NTA. Immersion is how you learn languages and become fluent. Not everyone can afford to immerse themselves in an environment where people primarily speak the language they want to learn, so consuming media in the Target language is a close second option.

The number one reason why I speak good English is because I had to translate Ocarina of Time to my friends while playing and watching a lot of The Simpsons as a kid.\n\nNTA it's objectively better to learn a language by actually just forcing yourself to use it. Otherwise, everyone who 'took Spanish in highschool' would be really fucking good at Spanish, but how often do you actually meet anyone who took X language in school, and now speak that language even semi- fluently? I'd say 90% of us can't speak whatever language we took in school  beyond counting to 10 and introducing ourselves, because the way we teach languages is useless.", "Yeah, me too.

I wouldn't say I speak it fluently or anything, but I would say that I know more Spanish than French and I had 4 semesters of French in college.

I studied German and French in school, for years. I do not speak either (though I can understand German and know a German guy who understands but can't speak English, so our conversations are very confusing to anyone nearby). I've studied Spanish and Swedish independently with a lot of watching films, listening to music and trying to read novels. My Spanish is rusty, but give me a few days in Spain and I'd be talking fluently again. Swedish... well, Swedes switch to English so readily it's hard to make yourself speak, but I do alright when with people who don't speak English. Before switching to other methods, I did duolingo intensively in both languages.
