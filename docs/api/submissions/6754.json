Even now when I am there I only speak English with my non second language speaking friends. \n\nTV and movies are also great because they introduce the world's that the language has been/is a part of. Its a great way, especially for teenagers, to first learn about cultural differences that exist in the different peoples of this world. They can also be inspiring.\n\nI have been loving Netflix for making Arabic language programmes more accessible for me in the UK - I am learning it as my third language and it is helpful for me especially with understanding what levels of politeness is normal, how people can address each other, slang words, societal problems and ways of thinking. \n\nOf course, TV and film should be backed up with appropriate learning such as proper classes in the languages and real life immersion. \n\nI would be supporting and helping Katie learn Spanish as much as possible, starting with books about some aspect of the Spanish speaking world that she would find interesting - maybe a book about Mexican superstitions and folklore? Nature of the Central Americas? \n\nI find it highly questionable that your sister seems to have a problem with hearing a language other than English in her home or that her daughter is watching and understanding things she can't- either way it's bad. \n\nA person I knew liked this loved to act like he was super tolerant in public but behind closed doors he was homophobic, racist and misogynistic.

For a more technical perspective, there are two possible routes to learning a language: learning and acquisition. You can acquire a language solely through exposure, but learning will help the process along and can result in greater fluency and accuracy for some.

But spending time earning the language (attending classes or learning online or via an app) will also greatly help the process and can speed up acquisition."]}
