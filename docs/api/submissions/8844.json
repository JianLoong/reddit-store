If this \"info\" came straight from your friend, please make inquiries of your own to find out what resources are actually available in your community.\n\nIf she is truly end of life, then her social worker or medical team should be able to set up competent palliative care SOMEWHERE, either in an institutional setting or through home nursing care by professionals or volunteers.\n\nYou are not either of those things, OP: not a volunteer, not a professional.

I\u2019m a RN, but very physically demanding for even a few people to do it. My suggestion would be to find an inpatient hospice somewhere. There has to be options for her, financially.

Your friend should see if she can go into an inpatient hospice.  Hospice care can typically last a few days up to several months.", "NTA, mostly bypassing judgment here. Either way I don't think you're a bad person for the decision you choose. To me it seems like you don't want to/it would be financially difficult to (and you know that) and you have come here to justify not caring for her (not shaming and knowing/enforcing your limits isn't selfish). If so I think that is the right decision for you. Life and death/hospice is such a serious issue that I think if it was someone you were meant to support in that way it would be more clear. For example, think of the people you care about most in your life, in an instant you would care for them in this scenario and I assume them for you. They may be a good friend, but it just doesn't seem to be on that level. Dying is a very difficult and emotionally taxing process for caregivers (as someone who has witnessed an aunt go through hospice with my mom as her main caretaker). You would also need to possibly be willing to change dippers, manage medications, ect. It is a full time job once they are in steep decline. And reminder, they can only estimate how long it could take and it could drag on. Just because you don't agree to take on this responsibility doesn't mean you can't be there for her in different ways. She is still an adult, and I get US healthcare sucks (I'm assuming) but there are still options out there if she truly has no one, and this is something she has to take on and discuss with her doctors and should have already discussed just in case. A good friend would have also explained this request to you as being entirely optional. Again, and sorry for being so repetitive, but it is very hard watching someone go through hospice. I would definitely do it again for the ones I love, but I just want you to feel prepared and justified in whatever you choose. PS: I am also sorry to hear you'll be losing a friend and I hope you can appreciate a few more good times together before the end.", "NAH. I can't bring myself to call a dying woman who doesn't have anyone else an AH. It's her end, she wants to be comfortable. She wants to go the way she wants. But what she wants is at direct odds with what you can give. You aren't an AH for not being able to do what she wants. \n\nI'll leave it at this. She's selfish for asking, but I wouldn't say it's wrong. You aren't selfish for not wanting to help, especially since after she has gone you'll still be left with the fallout of everything you've had to do for her. You can't put your life on hold indefinitely because hers will be gone soon. And take it from someone who has been there, end of life care takes a massive toll on your mental health. I doesn't end when they're gone. It's selfish to think about yourself in her death, but it's not wrong either. \n\nThe both of you need to be realistic about the reality of her death vs your life. If she wants you there all the time, she has to concede and (if it's an option) come and stay with/near you. If she can't or won't come to you, then she has to face the reality that she needs to find someone else or run the possibility of being alone, because you can't be there *every day*.\n\nI'm sure you've already done everything, but maybe start looking for charity or volunteer organisations. They might be aimed at elderly people, but they might be able to help. Provide someone for occasional care or just to stop in once a day.\n\nThis whole situation is awful. My heart bleeds for you and your friend. I wish you joy amidst the pain, laughter amidst the tears, and the knowledge that this will not last forever.", "NTA\n\nIt's understandable that your friend wants help and wants to be comfortable in her remaining days.  But her being terminal doesn't make her any more deserving of your time, energy, and money than anyone else.\n\nYou say that \"the community is tapped out\".  Realize that you are also tapped out and that what your friend is asking for is more than you can give.\n\nI recommend that you contact her cancer treatment center and ask about resources for free hospice care and medication.  Ask if they can connect your friend with services and charities that can help her.\n\nPut reasonable boundaries on your support.  \"Sorry, I love you and want you to only have the best, but I'm unable to give up all of my responsibilities to be your caregiver.  I'd be happy to talk to your medical providers to help you find support.  And I'll visit when I'm able.  But I can't do everything you're asking of me.\"", "NAH or N T A", "NTA.  Her doctor will make arrangements for her, if she is in a Western country.

Other than that, I will try and help as much as I am able to\u201d.   What country are you in?  In the US, once you are hospice care, hospice takes care of everything.  There is no cost for pain meds, supplies, nurses, etc.  You do what you can and do not feel guilty about what you cannot do.  And that includes if you cannot visit friend as much.  If you want to help, you let her know in what ways you can and will help.  If she says that won\u2019t work for me, I want this\u2026you reply..I\u2019m sorry.  I told you what works for me.  Rinse, lather, repeat.  Do not give in.", "I\u2019ve been agonizing over this for the last few days trying to process it. I appreciate you all giving your outlook - especially the people who have been on the other side of it. \n\nMy dad had cancer and it broke my heart to see him in pain. I still cry looking back at it. He died in a hospital with us all around him and it happened quickly at the end and I held is hand through it.\n\nI guess I\u2019m questioning my ability to bounce back after this. But in either scenario it\u2019s tough for me to be ok with. I\u2019m leaning towards being there for her. Other friends have come forward to also help so I won\u2019t be in it alone. Truthfully I still don\u2019t want to do it. It scares me but it also grieves me to not be there for her. My husband doesn\u2019t want me to do it but will support me with whatever I choose. \n\nI still would like some compromise from her by making it easier for us by making her location more convenient.

It's a sad situation, but you have to put yourself first.", "If she's in the USA and has no money or valuables, i.e. car, etc., she will qualify for Medicaid which will pay for hospice, meds, etc. I'm surprised the hospital, docs, social workers, etc. haven't been working to qualify her.\n\nMy good friend from HS had the same situation. Another HS friend with cancer asked her to take care of her, but only on her terms. My friend said no. She wasn't an AH for saying no to this request and neither would you be.

Horrific!", "This isn\u2019t really accurate. I just went through this with my father. In the US, Medicare/Medicaid pays for hospice care. But hospice care is NOT full time care. We had a CNA visit daily for 1 hour and an RN 2x per week. There needs to be a primary caregiver (my mom and I were for my dad). Or they can go to a nursing home for primary caregiving but you have to pay for that.\n\nHospice does pay for pain management though so this surprises me about her pain meds.\n\nAlternatively, there is a hospice facility in my state with full time care at no cost to the patient but it\u2019s typically for those truly at the very end (not sure if OP\u2019s friend lives near one).\n\nOP, I will say this-I had always resisted the idea that I would care for a dying parent, and insisted we could just pay for full time care. But I do not regret doing this for my dad. It was very hard (he developed terminal agitation, withered away, we had to change his diapers in that last week, etc.) but I am so glad I was there for him. I was also there when he took his final few breaths and passed peacefully. And I am grateful for that, truly. THAT is the way to die-peacefully, surrounded by loved ones.", "Yeah NTA but if you decide you can\u2019t care for her you should put in some leg work to see if you can get her some government aid.", "If they can\u2019t afford to actually do it, then it doesn\u2019t really matter. Either way, it\u2019ll still have emotional baggage/trauma attached.", "This!", "As I understand it, there will be nurses that will come by periodically. I have no idea how often or long a day that they will be available.", "Yes she is on Medicare. Hospice was  just approved and you may be right that her pain meds could be free now. I just know she said her pain meds are expensive from last week. As I understand it, inpatient care isn\u2019t an option available to her.", "She probably also qualifies for Medicaid. Care/Caid combined will pay for inpatient hospice care. I worked in this field for over 20 years and am still amazed at the percentage of the population who don't know this. \n\nI still think you should consider your husband and family first. If she's enters inpatient hospice, you could visit and do things like take her laundry home and bring her little treats, etc. (The laundries in those places are industrial and very hard on clothes). When my mother was in hospice, it was the little things that mattered to her."]}
