The guys outside found this hilarious (and I recognise that it is objectively funny) but then they started responding to him (\u201cooh is it a big poo\u201d) which I could really have done without. I opened the cubicle door and asked if they could wait outside while I dealt with this. The lead guy looked at me for a long time and said \u201cno, I\u2019ll stay right here\u201d.\n\nThey kept responding to my son every time he spoke and after a few minutes I asked them firmly to go away and leave me and my son alone. They again refused and said \u201cyou need to calm down\u201d and \u201clife is supposed to be fun why are you so uptight\u201d.\n\nI decided to get the hell out of there so abandoned the cleanup mission, stuffed my shit-smeared child back into his clothes and left.\n\nI then asked to speak to the manager, explained what had happened and he asked their whole group to leave.\n\nI genuinely can\u2019t decide whether I was the asshole here. On the one hand, I was super stressed and I didn\u2019t react perfectly (I should have just ignored them) but on the other hand I think \u201cplease stop talking to my naked child and give us some space\u201d is just the sort of thing you comply with without much arguing.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit 1: they weren\u2019t drunk drunk, they were probably 3-4 pints in.", "created_utc": 1676146048, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zwlrs/aita_for_getting_two_guys_thrown_out_of_the_pub/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a sucky situation to be in but finding humor in it is always a good way to handle things. But as a parent , you didnt like it and they should of left you and your kid alone to deal with the mess. So i get it", "YTA. You noted the situation as objectively funny yourself.  The guys were simply responding to your son, who obviously wasnt at risk other than your inability to handle the humor in the moment.  \n\nTheir actions offered no impact or harm, yet you wanted to deal with this by harassing them vs focusing on your son.", "Yta.

I learned that I had either never learned or never realized that \"a few\" and \"a couple\" were not synonyms.
