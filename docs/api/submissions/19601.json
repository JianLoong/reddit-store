I would normally say that but we rented a larger car because we have 5 people, 1 large dog, and luggage.\n\nIf he weren't going, we could have saved $500+ on renting the vehicle.\n\nI'd rather have him along as that was sort of the point of a family trip.\n\nWe did offer to consider an additional trip with her at a later date.", "5 hours then four days. The idea is giving me a bit of a panic attack. Thanks for your perspective.", "Thanks. The idea gives me and my partner lot of anxiety.", "We try to respect his privacy because my MIL is pretty nosy. I think it makes my BIL protective of his information.", "Not necessarily. My sibling and I have always been pretty tight lipped about our relationships until they get more serious because we can't trust some of our family not to snoop, judge, cast aspersions, and interrogate (and social media stalking). Idk if this is the case or not for OPs partner's family, but a lot of people would rather keep it private until they're more solid, stable, and comfortable in the relationship and willing to \"come out\".", "Thank you for the perspective. We planned and payed for the entire trip months ago (before the girlfriend was even in the picture). We also had to rent a larger car so that we can all fit comfortably in one vehicle. \n\nWe don't care about spending money. We would just like our comfort level and boundaries respected.", "Thanks! I appreciate that point of view. I haven't even considered that. \n\nIf that's the case, I would hope they learn how to communicate better with one another. But that makes me want her on the trip even less to be honest. Sounds like that scenario is nothing but drama.", "That\u2019s totally understandable. You could let him know that while you\u2019ll understand if he doesn\u2019t want to go, you were really looking forward to having him come along, so much that you spent extra to make sure the rental vehicle was big enough for everyone. But if you don\u2019t make it very clear that his choices are to come without his gf, or not come at all, he\u2019ll try to use that as leverage to get you to let him bring his GF.\n\nReally, it\u2019s kind of weird that she\u2019d be comfortable coming along on a family trip with someone she\u2019s been seeing for so little time. Not sure why your brother is so insistent on bringing her, but I imagine it might be just as awkward for her as for you. Ultimately, you can only set a clear boundary, and then it has to be up to him to decide if he\u2019s willing to disappoint family for someone he\u2019s only been seeing for 2 months. If he is, then shame on him.", "\"I'd rather have him along as that was sort of the point of a family trip.\" .. it is ridiculous to expect him to come when you exclude his gf.", "Yeah that sounds like hell. No problem.", "This is exactly why he didn't want to talk about the family. MIL fits your example.", "Not a problem. It was to be expected that the family vacations would stop happening at some point.  Now that time has come earlier than expected.", "Thanks! Your response is super helpful. Boundaries can be rough sometimes. I'm trying to be an ex people-pleaser. \n\nI also agree about the awkwardness. I would think it would be just as awkward for her. Possibly even more so. \n\nWe really do look forward to meeting her at a later date. Just not for the first time on a family vacation.", "I respectfully disagree.  This trip was planned and paid for by my partner and myself many months ago. About three times longer than the existence of his new girlfriend. \n\nWe also confirmed with him just a few weeks ago that he was still planning to come. We had to rent a larger vehicle to make room for him to come, and wanted to check in with him before renting the vehicle(as to not waste money in case he decided not to come after all). He didn't mention his girlfriend coming at that time. \n\nAnd in fact just last month when we all met up for mother's day he didn't want to talk about his girlfriend because the relationship was new and private (which we respected). \n\nIf this new girlfriend was a person we actually knew, she obviously wouldn't be excluded. But I think it's a bit unfair to expect us to spend a vacation with someone we've never met. \n\nAlso, just another tidbit - this girlfriend doesn't drive. So we would also have to drive two hours out of our way on the day of the trip to go get her. The trip is 5 days away. We already had plans. \n\nIf he doesn't want to come, he's an adult and can make his own decisions. But I think that would be inconsiderate considering the circumstances.", "In that case, you're probably doing both BIL and his gf a favor by helping them dodge a bullet. Maybe phrase it to him that way if you can talk openly abt the MIL dynamic.\n\nI will say, it's an awkward dynamic when a family member has a very new love interest, but it's really kind and generous to extend offers to them to spend time with the family, especially if it could be serious. I had been dating a guy for 2.5 months when he got dragged to my sister's wedding, and my family insisted he be in many wedding pics. 7 years later and we're married now and I'm so thankful my family embraced him off-the-bat. A vacation certainly might not be the best venue for a first time meet, but maybe finding another way to introduce yourselves and include her soon would be nice :)", "You can disagree as much as you want. Won't change a thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe has a gf NOW, and you are excluding her. That likely means: No more family vacations, and he certainly will not come with you for this one. which is reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But I think it's a bit unfair to expect us to spend a vacation with someone we've never met.\" .. YOu are not EXPECTED. But you would be unreasonable  to expect him to still come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"This trip was planned and paid for by my partner and myself many months ago. \" .. So you are learning that you can't buy friends, you actually need to treat them well to keep them.", "That's a great perspective! I would think my BIL would want to ease her into the situation since the family dynamic involving my MIL can be toxic. My BIL honestly doesn't have a great relationship with her. \n\nMy partner and myself would absolutely love to meet the new girlfriend after the trip. \n\nI am super family oriented. And possible future family counts in that category in my book. If this was a party or celebration this wouldn't even be a question. She'd be very welcome. But a 4-day trip on the first meeting makes me very uneasy.", "Ok. Thanks for your input."]}
