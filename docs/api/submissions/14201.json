(I agree)\n\nYou looked at the study and found it \"defined \u201cresilience\u201d as mitigating stress alone, as opposed to mitigating stress through social support.

(I'm going to say that's a mouthful as well as arguable and kind of tangled up. Social support as opposed to individual resilience is a far more effective means of coping with stress for women. It can be for men as well, yet men tend not to go that route. Generally speaking, due to modern day childrearing, boys become men who hold their emotions in and will avoid appearing weak at all costs. The impact is a stronger sense of resilience than that found within women.)\n\nAnyhow, you then told him the TikTok he watched was misleading and needed to start citing shit. Why? \nI agree with dude. Where are your citations? Not to be rude but Im not on board with what you're conveying.\n\nEdit: Cackles at downvotes. Plops my ass on the hill.

I (22f) have a bachelors in nutrition so those are the videos that bother me most, but there are others related to social sciences, psych, medicine, etc. I understand that everyone\u2019s social media feeds will have misleading, oversimplified, and false information, but learning how to critically think and fact check are life skills. he takes any information he is presented as fact and when I express doubt, it turns into an argument. so, I started asking him to send me actual studies in order to prove his point.\n\nexample: he told me that men are more resilient to stress than women. I looked at the study he was talking about which defined \u201cresilience\u201d as mitigating stress alone, as opposed to social support. in the study, men almost entirely relied on resilience to cope with stress whereas women relied more on social support. women were more effective at coping with stress as social support was more effective than resilience. I explained the study to him and told him the tik tok he watched was misleading.\n\nI may be abusing this strategy because he doesn\u2019t know how to find or interpret research. so the other day he told me that his cousin\u2019s friend watched an exorcism and therefore ghosts or whatever are real. I told him to show me a valid scientific study, as a way to say \u201cI would need good evidence to believe that,\u201d but he actually spent a good hour looking. when he couldn\u2019t find much of anything, he got mad and said that I am argumentative, closed minded, and \u201calways need to be right.\u201d\n\nto be clear, whether or not he believes in ghosts is whatever. the issue is that he believes a lot of sexist, racist, transphobic, and factually incorrect information just because he sees it on tik tok. AITA for doubting him when he brings this type of info up in conversation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don\u2019t disagree with your understanding of the study from how I described it, and would be open and interested to having a conversation about it with someone who interprets/understands it the way you do. he is lacking that kind of nuance and instead takes things at face value without doing his own research and forming his own opinions.\nand as for your last paragraph - the burden of proof is on the person making the claim, not on the person questioning it. if I made a generalization that he questioned, I would happily provide sources.", "She asked if she was TA and I told her she was.
