And still, they were vile (I used to spend summers there, so was intimately aware of how much work went into them). \n\nAlso, their poops are much wetter than cat poops, so it makes it harder to pick up.  And you're meant to use newspaper or corn-based litter, so it doesn't clump like cat litter, nor does it trap the smell as well.  And you've got to let them out of the cage a lot so they're happy, and they will shit in the corners of the rooms even though they're \"litterbox trained.\"\n\nSo you've got a musky animal with awful poops.  I used to want ferrets and had spent time with some neighbors who had them, as well as my cousins, and the experiences seemed to be quite common across the board.

I truly think the smell and poop is due to them being fed an inappropriate diet.\n\nFerrets are obligate carnivores, like cats. Any ferret kibble I had my crew on had wet poos that stunk. I eventually went to feeding raw, and made sure they got their chicken hearts for extra taurine. Also fed whole prey (frozen/thawed), mice and rats to them, and that seemed to be the best for their digestion, gave them the healthiest poops when they were eating all the skin and bones, etc. \nThey do have a mild musky smell, but I personally find it natural and animal smelling nice, like how some people like the smell of horses or dog fur.", "Digestive system is different from a cat. Ferrets are pretty early animals on the evolutionary chain and their digestive system is a lot shorter and lacks features such as a caecum that cats have. So you have to be really careful what you feed them - like cat's they are obligate carnivores but tend to need higher meat proteins, can't handle things like peas a cat can and if you give them things like brocoli, you get a piece of brocoli out the other end within 3 hours. (edit - don't give fruit/veg - they like it but linked to expensive diseases like insulonoma in later life). \n\nMost pet foods aren't all meat - some can be as low as 20% meat and rest made up of grains, potatoes or sweet potato. So that's a lot of unprocessed food going through the gut. More meat protein in the kibble you feed, less and sweeter smelling poop but very expensive. Not found the pretzels more runny than cats - if they are, then best to check for a gut issue. Out of cage, yes little legs,small bladder, best to have multiple litter trays.", "Different animals have more or less offensive poop. \nHorse shit - minor so shovelling it a isn\u2019t too bad.

You could maybe feed the snake a few days early and then a snake doesnt need to eat for a week... so OP wouldnt have to feed it all. But if the snake is on a solid schedule, and the snake isnt hungry that day, the snake will just not eat the mouse. But then you cant leave the live mouse in the tank to wait, you gotta get it back out... now you got a live mouse to deal with until the snake is ready... it can be a whole freaking mess.\n\nYou could also maybe switch to frozen mice for the vacation. But, again, if the snake has formed any type of habit in expecting a live mouse, it may just not eat the dead mouse. So now you have OP with a hungry snake and nothing to feed it. Does OP even know where to get live mice at this point?\n\nIt doesnt even have to be about \"terrified\".\n\nPersonally, I could handle all that.

An entire adult hob smells terrible but neutering tends to drop smell  by 95%. They have very simple digestive system that are basically built for meat only so if feeding a food high in grain, it is going straight through. More meat you feed, less poop and less smell. And they secrete oils into their coat - you wash them, the coat loses all its oils, the system goes into overdrive to replace and you end up with a smelly ferret.

I'd rather know if the person is competent enough or not. \n\nIf you were a pet owner, would you want someone who does not feel comfortable taking care of your pets?

Like this could be a 10 minute then come back in 30 and try again thing. If you dropped the mouse (you would hold the tail) then you had to guard against the snake (which was harmless but aroused into hunger and in the mood to strike) and get the mouse and try again. Which is hard to do if you are scared of snakes like I was.  My friend didn\u2019t lure away the snake once and when she picked up the mouse she ended up bit and I had to help free her.

I personally would be incredibly squeamish even touching a frozen mouse and seeing its body be eaten by a snake. It would make ME uncomfortable. Maybe it doesn't for you, and kudos to you for being able to, but I can't and I assume there are plenty others out there who would equally be uncomfortable feeding a live or dead mouse to a snake.", "But OP doesn't mention feeling insecure in her ability to care for the animals. She went in \"apprehensive\", found the mice \"gross\" and the ferret smell \"unbearable\". Her big issue is it being icky. She doesn't seem to have legitimate fears that would prevent her from taking proper care of the animals, she doesn't want to deal with the smell for a few days. \n\nOP has not yet answered my question about whether she asked for help with her pets from her neighbour. If the neighbour offered completely on their own, without even the tiniest prompt from OP, then it was a favour that doesn't really require reciprocation (though it would still be nice, and probably even more warranted, given how nice that would be).
