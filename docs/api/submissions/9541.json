She helped you a LOT by the sound of it and your post seems to try to minimize that.\n\nI'd much rather play with/clean up after ferrets and a snake than have to take a dog on a nice long walk and pick up poop. \n\nIf you're truly unable to provide labor, you should at the very least repay her kindness with a gift card for a pet sitting service (I use Rover) and a small token like some flowers for your initial rudeness.", "NAH. You have the right to refuse to take care of her pets but she also has the right to drop you and no longer care for yours.

How could a ferret's smell be worse than that / what's the difference?", "Ferrets are next level stinky.that would be a hard pass for me.", ">used to all their awful smells\n\nThat's the answer, if you're around something a lot you get used to it. People I know without cats come to my apartment and immediately smell cat, but since I've had cats my entire 34 years of life, if I am smelling what they smell to me it's just the smell of House.\n\nPlus in addition to ferrets having a particularly strong and distinct scent, unlike a fresh cat/dog poop where you deal with the scent while you collect it and then it goes away when you toss it in a bin, the ferret smell would be there the whole time. And iirc their poop has a worse consistency than a cat or dog's generally would be.", "No. Ferret smell is super nasty and it lingers on your hair and clothes like being around a smoker.", "wholeheartedly agree! the trade-off (as many others have called it) is just not equal between those two.. the neighbour should have considered that reply and not take for granted that OP would agree", "Agreed YTA and that this is weak, after the help he's received from her. \n\nBut:\n\n>I didn't think \"smells\" was an excuse adults gave not to do something\n\n...You should see zoo interns when asked to clean [tiger dung](https://a-z-animals.com/media/2022/10/iStock-1366115423-1024x614.jpg) up for the first time. Oh boy is it a sight to see.", "The unspoken rule of pet ownership is \"if I ask you to help with my pets then that means I'm willing to help you with yours\" if you aren't willing to help with their pets you HAVE to make that clear AND pay them when they watch your pets for you. Only thinking about yourself until it's too late is a very much a habit specific to assholes", ">And ferrets smell utterly disgusting.\n\nWhat is it like, it's that different from cats or dogs? They're way smaller, right?", "This.", "Ugh.  My cousins had ferrets, and yes they had had their anal scent glands removed.  There are still scent glands in their skin, which obviously can't be removed. \n\nMy cousin had two ferrets in a nice big metal cage that was deep-cleaned every day, they cleaned up the urine and feces from the litter boxes multiple times per day, washed all their bedding in super hot water every week, and bathed them once per month.  And still, they were vile (I used to spend summers there, so was intimately aware of how much work went into them). \n\nAlso, their poops are much wetter than cat poops, so it makes it harder to pick up.  And you're meant to use newspaper or corn-based litter, so it doesn't clump like cat litter, nor does it trap the smell as well.  And you've got to let them out of the cage a lot so they're happy, and they will shit in the corners of the rooms even though they're \"litterbox trained.\"\n\nSo you've got a musky animal with awful poops.  I used to want ferrets and had spent time with some neighbors who had them, as well as my cousins, and the experiences seemed to be quite common across the board.  Ferrets are obligate carnivores, just like cats, although my cousin's did enjoy some fruit and veggies occasionally as treats.", "Idk but it is.

If you are a ferret person you get used to smelling it. But if you're not around them it's like a musky ammonia smell that burns your nose. I hate that smell. I'd put it up there with skunk. It's just gross.", "The smell is like 10x worse if they don\u2019t have their anal glands removed. It\u2019s more comparable to a skunk than to a dog or cat.", "So you have no idea how herbivores' and carnivores' feces are different.\n\nJust as an illustration, try comparing rooting grass with a rooting carcass.", "This changes nothing. When OP asked for a pet sitting favor she needed to both pay the neighbor and be clear that she was unwilling to pet sit in return. There was a moment in time (I absolutely guarantee it) when OP thought about returning the favor and realized they didn't want to and also didn't decide to make it up to the neighbor another way. That is the moment that made op the asshole", "If I\u2019m understanding OP\u2019s story correctly, he didn\u2019t know what type of pets she had until after she pet sat for him. \n\nThat being said, OP could offer to pay for the neighbor\u2019s pet care for this vacation, which would at least make the situation more fair.", "Idt you read OPs story correctly. She never said that and the odds that op and neighbor knew eachother well enough to give a key to OPs house but not well enough to know what pets neighbor had are 1 in a million. I think you made an extremely unlikely assumption based off of no information \n\nI agree that paying for a pet care service would make things square"]}
