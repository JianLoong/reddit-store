And you're meant to use newspaper or corn-based litter, so it doesn't clump like cat litter, nor does it trap the smell as well.  And you've got to let them out of the cage a lot so they're happy, and they will shit in the corners of the rooms even though they're \"litterbox trained.\"\n\nSo you've got a musky animal with awful poops.

I eventually went to feeding raw, and made sure they got their chicken hearts for extra taurine. Also fed whole prey (frozen/thawed), mice and rats to them, and that seemed to be the best for their digestion, gave them the healthiest poops when they were eating all the skin and bones, etc. \nThey do have a mild musky smell, but I personally find it natural and animal smelling nice, like how some people like the smell of horses or dog fur.", "Digestive system is different from a cat.

So you have to be really careful what you feed them - like cat's they are obligate carnivores but tend to need higher meat proteins, can't handle things like peas a cat can and if you give them things like brocoli, you get a piece of brocoli out the other end within 3 hours. (edit - don't give fruit/veg - they like it but linked to expensive diseases like insulonoma in later life). \n\nMost pet foods aren't all meat - some can be as low as 20% meat and rest made up of grains, potatoes or sweet potato. So that's a lot of unprocessed food going through the gut. More meat protein in the kibble you feed, less and sweeter smelling poop but very expensive. Not found the pretzels more runny than cats - if they are, then best to check for a gut issue. Out of cage, yes little legs,small bladder, best to have multiple litter trays.", "Different animals have more or less offensive poop. \nHorse shit - minor so shovelling it a isn\u2019t too bad. Cows are a bit worse. Cat and dog is way worse.\nPig shit - that stuff is horrendous.", "I love snakes. But if we are talking about live mice: it's fairly f-n horrifying to watch. The mouse squirms and screams and struggles. Eyes bulge out of their heads... it is just truly not pleasant.\n\nOf course, there are possible solutions. You could maybe feed the snake a few days early and then a snake doesnt need to eat for a week... so OP wouldnt have to feed it all. But if the snake is on a solid schedule, and the snake isnt hungry that day, the snake will just not eat the mouse. But then you cant leave the live mouse in the tank to wait, you gotta get it back out... now you got a live mouse to deal with until the snake is ready... it can be a whole freaking mess.\n\nYou could also maybe switch to frozen mice for the vacation. But, again, if the snake has formed any type of habit in expecting a live mouse, it may just not eat the dead mouse. So now you have OP with a hungry snake and nothing to feed it. Does OP even know where to get live mice at this point?\n\nIt doesnt even have to be about \"terrified\".\n\nPersonally, I could handle all that. Thru roommates Ive lived with 5-10 different snakes over the years.\n\nNo, for me it would be the simple mention of ferrets. Those suckers stink.", "I like you.", "Yeah but these are completely different animals that require different types of care. \n\nI don't have to carry a living animal to be killed (or even a dead, frozen one where it'll be eaten) in order to clean a litter box or walk a dog. As a vegetarian for 11 years, I could never ever ever put a mouse in a tank for a snake to be eaten. \n\nReciprocating pet care is absolutely a thing that friends do among each other, but if you own a snake, you are accepting the responsibility of taking care of it and realize that others may be uncomfortable with it.", "They are related to skunks,stoats and weasels. That means they have anal glands that they release when frightened or very excited. It stinks but tends to dissipate within 5 mins. I live in UK with multiple ferrets and it is illegal, on grounds of animal cruelty, to descent a ferret. And being honest, unless you are frightening your ferret a lot, once out of kit stage they don't release.\n\nThe main small is if you don't neuter them, feed them a bad diet or overwash them. An entire adult hob smells terrible but neutering tends to drop smell  by 95%. They have very simple digestive system that are basically built for meat only so if feeding a food high in grain, it is going straight through. More meat you feed, less poop and less smell. And they secrete oils into their coat - you wash them, the coat loses all its oils, the system goes into overdrive to replace and you end up with a smelly ferret. Do need to clean out often as grain-based poop smells.\n\nAlso people tend to be used to the smell of dogs and cats - they aren't used to ferrets and people tend to react to unknown smells more strongly.", "I do but that still does not make me perfectly fine with it. I know me -- I will start crying if I was forced to put a mouse in a container that will soon to be eaten afterwards. Whether it was alive or dead already, I would be incredibly uncomfortable doing that. \n\nI have two cats and love em dearly. I am a-ok with their cat food having meat in it because their diet and species needs it. But I would never buy a dead, frozen mouse for them to attack and eat. I once considered owning lizards but once I realized they were nearly all carnivores and had to feed them insects, I immediately understood my limits and realized that this would not be a responsible decision as I knew I couldn't go through with that and keep the lizards safe and healthy. \n\nBeing a good pet parent should include knowing your limits and boundaries. I know I can't take care of animals that require live or dead animals in its diet unless its already used in its food such as cat/dog food.", "My brother had a ferret. Once. Briefly. The stench was unbearable.", "Frozen-thawed is ALWAYS an option. I have never fed my scale babies live, never will.\n\nIf a snake is hungry enough it will eat. The zombie-mouse dance works for picky snakes and, failing all else, the snake will not die of starvation in a matter of even a few weeks. It can wait until the owners get back.", "I think the unspoken rule of pet ownership is really \"if I ask you to help with my pet, that means I'm willing to help you with your pets that are the same kind\". there are all kinds of reasons someone would be able to help with one pet but not another. allergies, fears, inexperience with that species or breed... even a scheduling conflict, like I'd be happy to walk a neighbor's dog or give their cat a pill, but not if it had to be at 9:30am since that's the same time as my only meeting.", ">Reciprocating pet care is absolutely a thing that friends do among each other, but if you own a snake, you are accepting the responsibility of taking care of it and realize that others may be uncomfortable with it.\n\nAnd whoever is on the other end of that deal should be aware of their unwillingness to help right off the bat. So they should never ask for help with their (more standard) pets. If you're unwilling to reciprocate, don't take the favour... 3 times.", "Do you read comments you reply to or nah? I very clearly stated the acceptable alternative if youre not comfortable with snakes. Giving more reasons why you don't want to care for snakes has genuinely 0 value after I already said \"that's OK but here's what you have to do instead\"", "Isn't a frozen mouse exactly the same as cat food? Snakes also need to eat meat. Unless you're deluding yourself about what's in the food you're feeding your cats, I don't see the difference.", "I love snakes, and I agree 100% with your comment. Know your limits. I grew up with a snake that wasn't bred in captivity and it refused to eat anything it didn't hunt itself. I wouldn't be comfortable with that now, but have no issue with snakes that were bred in captivity who eat frozen animals. That's my line. Life and death are intertwined, but that doesn't mean we are used to being exposed to it like that.", "You sound like a hypocrite to me. You are fine with feeding your pets processed animals, but draw the line at frozen mouse? There is no difference here. If anything the mice were treated better than the animals the end up as dog/cat food.", "Agreed. Wet food makes me nauseous, but it's something I can put up with if I'm feeding someone else's pet (or if one of my own ever develops a health issue or pickiness and requires it) because it isn't emotionally upsetting. Frozen mice I just couldn't manage. Maybe in a true life or death emergency, but not otherwise.", "He probably did not have it descented; many people do and while there will still be some odor, I doubt it's really that bad.  OP is just being whiny and the neighbor should decline an future requests for assistance.  YTA OP", ">try comparing rooting grass with a rooting carcass\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know you meant rotting but I still got a kick out of imagining an animal concentrating very hard as it tries to grow roots (because I'm clearly an adult and mature, this was imagined with a cartoony baby animal--think pictures you would see in one of those \"My first book\" for babies--that is grossly mis-colored (discolored?  Is it discolored if it's meant to look like that? Anyway, blue zebra!)--basically hunched on two legs (baby book, remember) with furrowed brows and looking like they have a bad case of constipation as they try to concentrate on growing roots.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...It's possible I've been spending too much time with babies/toddlers.", "This right here.\n\nLike I could take a cat or 2 into my house. I havent even had a cat for a few years now but I still have litter trays and scoopers and food bowls. If the cats dont have any overly taxing medical needs, you just need a bag of food a nd a box of litter and the cats will basically figure themselves out for a week or 2.\n\nI can not take a dog. Just for the simple reason that I dont have time to be walking a dog multiple times a day. Dog would be lucky to get a few minutes in the morning, have to stay couped in my place all day, and then Id probably forget to take the dog out before bed. End up remembering just as my eyes are truly closing... have to jump out of the warm bed... get re dressed... ugh. No, I cant watch your dog.", "I guess it's more about seeing/perceiving a food in its original form that makes some people uncomfortable. Frozen rats are rats, rodents with legs, tails, face, all intact. Wet foods for cats and dogs are like, bits and pieces of processed meats in sauce. It's not hypocrisy to feel fine with feeding processed meats that you have slightest ideas of its origin judging by its form, and to feel uncomfortable feeding an animal that still retains its form before their death.", "I love your logic where you admit ferrets that aren\u2019t descented smell horrible but theres no way it\u2019s \u201creally that bad\u201d. What if the neighbors ferrets aren\u2019t descented either??", "Disagree. There is no difference when it comes to the animals themselves, it's purely perception, which in this case is meaningless and changes nothing about the fact that you are serving an animal to another animal."]}
