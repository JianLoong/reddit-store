If your husband is  worried about your son's 2 am dish washing, perhaps he'd rather you wake him up to do them?", "NTA. Him telling you that you can do it if it bothers you tells me that he still needs to work on being considerate. The fact that your husband agrees with him is a bigger problem.", "NTA - and HOLY CRAP your son is turning into lazy, manipulative little AH:\n\n*we got in an argument about him being tired and how* ***I can do the dishes if it bothers me.***\n\nYou need to nip this in the bud as soon as possible, OP.  That level of disrespect isn't taught.  It's a sign of being too hands off and not breaking down what it takes to be an adult.  That HIS actions will have consequences.

One day he left stuff in the sink and went to work. I then took all the dirty dishes out of the sink and put it on the floor next to his bedroom door.

Keep it up until he figures out just how easy it to clean up after himself.", "NTA. I was leaning a bit towards E.S.H as sleep is important, especially for students, but he brought this on himself.

Cleaning up after yourself is not a punishment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlthough, I do want to ask, and I'm sure this isn't the case, but figured I'd ask, could he be sleepwalking, sleepcooking and sleepeating? People do weird things while sleepwalking and given the stresses high school students have nowadays, he could be doing all that.", "NTA he\u2019s not tired to cook that late he cannot be that tired to clean. Is he fat?", "YTA. he could just do them in the morning, there's no benefit to restricting waking him at two am. You aren't teaching him anything other than to be resentful. There should be a purpose behind punishments.", "YTA, slightly leaning ESH\n\n1) you said you thought this problem was fixed. If thr behavior is improving, you should not be so harsh over a single mistake\n2) The punishment doesn't fit the crime. He didn't wake anyone up. He made a mess. Make him clean it. Or take away his privilege of using the kitchen unsupervised. Teaching people to clean rhe kitchen at 2\tam is not a useful lesson. Give him a logical consequence based on what he did.\n\nYes, he's being a jerk for not cleaning and there can be consequences but not this one. He was right for what he said to you after school imo, and would be justified in costing you a few hours sleep as restitution.\n\nIf his problem was waking people up, not making a mess, I'd take your side.", "Nta", "NTA", "I\u2019d like to know more details.

What\u2019s he got, worms?", "INFO: what\u2019s wrong with cleaning them the next day?\n\nWaking him up to clean is a YTA move and borderline abusive since he won\u2019t be able to get back to sleep and will suffer the next day, be bad at school. Sleep deprivation is a torture tactic, not a reasonable expectation of a teen.\n\nWaking him up a half hour early to clean the he kitchen is what you should have done. \n\nTell him if he wants a late night meal, fine, but he has to agree to either clean up that night or clean the kitchen before going to school.", "YTA \n\nNot for trying to teach your son a lesson but the way and time in which you attempted to teach him a lesson.\n\nYou got into an argument with your tired son after school because you woke him up at 2AM to teach him a lesson.

He shouldn't leave a mess in the kitchen\n\nBut - waking a kid in the middle of a school night isn't the right tactic to take. \n\nHe can start taking on the dishes as a regular chore though.  Every evening HE has to clean up from dinner.  If he makes a mess in the kitchen at night and leaves them then you can wake him up early before school.

But even if she was out drinking it\u2019s still her 15 yrs old son to clean up after himself", "Oh I wish I was out drinking, instead of got to talk about substations for 7 hours of my life", "Calling it sleep deprivation is sooooooo dramatic.  At 15 you don't think he's had to cram for any exams yet?  One night of less than optimal sleep so minor as to be negligible.  Do this to the kid every night for a few day to week and we can talk.  And cleaning the whole kitchen!!!!!!!  That would be a major time sink and so much more inconvenient.", "He should not have gone to bed before he cleaned up after himself, though.", ">I would rather do any of those for an entire year than being subjected to sleep deprivation. That's literally a kind of   \n>  \n>torture\n\nlol, next time my neighbours wake me up with an early morning singalong, i'll be sure to report them to the UN", "If he has the energy and appetite to make spaghetti at midnight, he's got the energy to clean up after himself.", "I have no problem with him eating, it\u2019s not cleaning his mess which is the problem", "Oh, please. A 15 year old is perfectly capable of preparing food and eating it cleanly in the middle of the night without leaving dishes all over the damn kitchen. I (40m) did it all the time. I still do, in fact.\n\nIf the kid has the time to prepare spaghetti and sauce, he has a few additional minutes to rinse and wash the pans.\n\nNTA", "She owes him no apology at all for holding him accountable for being inconsiderate and refusing to provide simple courtesy to the others who live in the house. If he can cook that late, he can clean that late. If he gets yanked out of bed every time he pulls this crap, he will quickly learn the lesson that it's easier to clean up after himself. It's called FAFO.", "You must be the son.", "Dishes can be time sensitive; leaving dirty dishes in the sink overnight is an invitation for bugs.", "Found the son.  \ud83d\udc40", "How are dishes not time sensitive? If he doesn\u2019t get up and go them, when is he going to do them? Let them sit there until after school the next day?", "They hated you because you spoke the truth", "Or stays up playing video games or scrolling on his phone? It's laughable to equate 15 minutes of cleaning up your own mess as torture!", "It probably takes an hour or two to clean a kitchen. Sleep deprivation, even for one night, is a punishment that lasts. For 24 hours MINIMUM. It isn't some one second thing like losing some allowance or a smack on the ass. There's also the indignity of being woken up and humiliated. It's totally excessive. I feel like this is just a difference of opinion on what consequence we'd prefer to receive. To me, I'd accept basically anything else to avoid this.", "I agree. But the harm could just as easily be rectified by waking him up *earlier* to clean. Or say \"guess you're getting a tardy\" today if he doesn't give himself enough time to clean. I'm never going to agree that waking someone up from sleep as punishment is appropriate here.", "I rate a teens need for sleep higher than your preference for a clean kitchen when it can readily be cleaned in the morning.", "Agreed. The 15 year old has chosen a preference for eating late at night and preparing food rather than selecting leftovers or easy options, then chooses to leave a mess after being told not to. So the kid can choose to give up sleep for all of those preferences but not to clean? That's a nope. If you clean as you prepare there's hardly any mess left. As a mom of teens who sometimes do this, waking them up is the only way I was able to get them to clean it up...as they wouldn't clean it in the morning either.", "The mom apologizing to the kid?? Whew. The new generation is doomed if that\u2019s where we\u2019re landing.", "Right? I suggested several options for potential consequences here, which some of thsse same people down voting me *said were more harsh than what the mom did*, and they're acting like i said it's awesome this kid doesn't do the dishes lmao.", "Two hours to clean up a kitchen?? Do you think he splattered food up the walls and on the ceiling? Come on now, that\u2019s unreasonable. No way it took him more than half an hour, and that\u2019s if he used half the equipment in the kitchen.", "Having spent several late nights in HS cramming for tests this \"sleep deprivation stuff\" is hilarious.  Its really not as bad as your making it out.  Your way over the top with this angle.", ">It probably takes an hour or two to clean a kitchen.\n\nIn what fucking universe? It takes me an hour to clean my entire *apartment.*", "It really can\u2019t, I need to cook in the morning for breakfast a dirty kitchen is the worse and no he doesn\u2019t have time before the bus comes. I wake him up early to clean it well now I am up early also. If he isn\u2019t fast enough than my youngest might not have breakfast in time.\n\nThere are way to many things that could go wrong in the morning and mess up the whole family", "I agree. The other person was saying that \"cleaning the whole kitchen\" is would be excessive. My point is that it wouldn't be and is preferable to sleep deprivation. I was suggesting make him clean more than just his cooking mess, just like general cleaning", "lItErAl ToRtUrE", "Not all students do that, especially these days. I get that it works for some people, but we don't know if that's part of this kids lifestyle.\n\nFwiw, some people are really good at tests, specifically, and don't do the cramming stuff or even study at all. That was me. 35 ACT walking in blind, all 5s AP, etc. It just varies what each student requires", "I'd say ESH then if he's not cleaning in the morning.\n\nBut how dirty is he leaving things that you can't make breakfast? Spaghetti is one pot, one bowl, one fork. Maybe a pan if he's heating the sauce. How is that creating a mess that prevents you from cooking breakfast?", "There was sauce in the ceiling last night. You would think a single pot and bowl butttt no\n\nI don\u2019t know how he did that. It wasn\u2019t clean at all"]}
