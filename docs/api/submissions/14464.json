R has a drug and gambling addictions that more or less feeds off each other. My brother for lack of better words is a crappy criminal. He does the same routine every time he gets out of prison to the point it\u2019s almost comical. \n\nDay 1. He gets out of jail and hangs out with Mom. She usually gets him a phone, food, temporary place to stay while he waits for a spot in rehab. Once she leaves he goes missing for 24-48 hours to get drugs. Usually by selling his phone or stealing a car. \n\nDay 3 or 4. He reaches out after his high is over to either have mom attempt to pay off some drug debt/escorts/gambling or pick him up from a crack house and or take him back to his current residence.\n\nBy end of week his gone missing again and we usually just wait for him to get picked up my police for stealing a car. \n\nThis has been the case for the last 4-5 times he\u2019s gotten out of prison. We\u2019ve moved him out of his city so he couldn\u2019t be in contact with his dealers but he chooses to go back or find new people to aid in his addiction. \n\nSo after his most recent arrest (6 months ago) I decided to block his prison # for peace of mind. At least Until R decided to do better for himself. Yesterday I get a call from a different prison # and regrettably answer. R tells me he accrued a massive prison debt from borrowing snacks and other commissary items (prison no no #1 don\u2019t borrow shit) and the debt has doubled and tripled. Now multiple people in his unit are telling him he needs to pay up or else things are about to get real difficult. \n\nI flat out refused. Saying we already don\u2019t have a great relationship due to his actions and I refuse to help in a problem he created for himself and likely is drug related. My brother feels like family should help regardless of circumstance and that I\u2019m letting my emotions over how I feel about him cloud my judgment as he is in dire need of help. I blocked his number and called our Mom about the situation and she supports my decision but I do feel somewhat guilty even though I know he put this problem on himself.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1681136898, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hkgcg/aita_for_not_paying_my_brothers_prison_snackfood/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You being related to him doesn\u2019t make you obligated to handle his debts.", "Nta\n\n>My brother feels like family should help regardless of circumstance\n\nThat's a pretty convenient philosophy coming from someone who always needs help and is never expected to give it.", "NTA\n\nBailing him out every time has not been successful. Time to try NOT bailing him out.\n\nStand your ground - do not cave.", "NTA. The consequences of his actions are on him alone.", "NTA. This is never going to end until you remove yourself from this situation. I know it\u2019s really painful but you did the right thing. Also he\u2019s probably lying", "NTA\n\nIsn't there some old adage that approximately states \"Idiocy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results\"?  Seems to me that bailing him out of this latest grief is unlikely to do anything but temporarily ease his latest problem.", "i have no doubt if you cleared his debt hed just rack it up again soon after.", "Your brother is a very sick man with an extremely addictive personality. Putting him in prison is a travesty of our judicial system. This can be easily seen from the fact that after he leaves prison he still needs rehab.\n\nThe thing is that nothing matters to him as much as getting drugs. As much as he may love you and your mother deep down, the drive for drugs is higher.\n\nSo you have an incredibly painful choice. You can either remember that you love your brother and help him regardless of how much he uses you or you can back off. Consequences and punishment are completely irrelevant. This is a choice that I assume you've had to make many times.\n\nNeither choice would make you an asshole and both choices will leave you sad and depressed and feeling hopeless. \n\nI am very sorry for what you're dealing with and NTA.", "NTA. Your brother is a lost cause. You\u2019re just throwing good money after bad. \n\nIf he starts doing things that look like maybe he\u2019s really trying to turn around like rehab or something, ok then maybe help him. But this is just a waste of your money.", "NTA. You have to have healthy boundaries for yourself. Yeah, guilt is a bitch and it's going to weigh on you. But if you guys keep bailing him out over and over again, all it's doing is teaching him he always has a safety net... and that's one reason the behavior keeps repeating. It's going to be hard but refusing to cover for him this time is necessary.  Stay strong and hang in there.", "NTA\nIt is not your job to pay his debts.", "NTA. Actions have consequences.", "helping and enabling are two different things, but there's also a point where the damage this stuff causes affects everybody. \n\nIt's a slow and painful process healing from these condition\n\nHe will get hurt, and it won't be anyone's fault, but he will get hurt. At some point, family and friends have to protect themselves.", "NTA you are helping him by not enabling him.", "Look, if he's being honest, he might get shivved. So if you pay his debt you might save his life.\n\nOf course, he could be bullshitting. But the problem is he knows that you'll help, and he'll do it again. And again. And again.\n\nSo you're NTA if you don't pay, but there's a likelihood he could be hurt. I don't know how the system works, but could you contact them and ask for him to be removed from the general population?", "NTA at all, but you have to think about it though-is it really worth him getting stabbed to death in prison over a few bucks, just to prove a point? If you can afford it maybe tell him youll help but this is his last chance with you, for real, and stick to it. Tell him next time he can lose your number and call mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
