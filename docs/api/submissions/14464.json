After reading everyone\u2019s comments I think it\u2019s best my brother learns to not even put himself in these situations to begin with.

When he\u2019s out of prison she\u2019ll help occasionally to bail him out of anything small but she\u2019s just as tired as I am. It\u2019s just harder for her to detach herself from the situation since it\u2019s her child.

Thank God he has been clean and sober for 2 years now he has his own apartment, he's a manager in a restaurant, spends time with his kids and he's doing very well he went from living on the streets eating out a dumpsters and doing anything he could for drugs to living a good life. And I think that us as a family giving him a little tough love and not paying his way and enabling him helped him get here. Every single day I worried he would be dead but I realized it was out of my control. Not to say that I washed my hands with him when he was living on the streets. I used to go find him bring him home with me do his laundry cleaning up feed him let him stay for a few days offer to get him in rehab which he would refuse and he'd go back to the streets. It took him going to jail and getting in a program finally through mental health court the jail itself all they do is punish people.", "I'm not judging your decision either way... Well, I am as NTA, but just providing food for thought. \n\nAnother alternative is to pay it, and make it clear that come rain or shine, this is the absolute last time - No matter the circumstances. \n\nIt's a way to wash your hands of the situation and any potential guilt you may feel.", "Unsure tbh I didn\u2019t really want to entertain the thought of me paying it so I didn\u2019t give him time to tell me that much. I presume it\u2019s not a small debt probably a few hundred bucks because my brother reached out to me VS mom.   Mom is the one who keeps a few dollars in his phone account and the occasional few dollars in his commissary. So he wouldn\u2019t want to burn that bridge over something like this.

Trick me twice, shame on me.\"  He has made his bed and now has to deal with the repercussions.

Old dogs don\u2019t learn new tricks unless there are zero other options. Sad as it is, that even means their enablers rejecting the notion that what happens to the addict is somehow the enabler\u2019s own fault (if only I had given them the money; they were right, I should have gone to get them when they called; if somethings happens to them, I\u2019m going to wish I could take it back and pay off their debt).
