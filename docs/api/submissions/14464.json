Usually by selling his phone or stealing a car. \n\nDay 3 or 4. He reaches out after his high is over to either have mom attempt to pay off some drug debt/escorts/gambling or pick him up from a crack house and or take him back to his current residence.\n\nBy end of week his gone missing again and we usually just wait for him to get picked up my police for stealing a car. \n\nThis has been the case for the last 4-5 times he\u2019s gotten out of prison. We\u2019ve moved him out of his city so he couldn\u2019t be in contact with his dealers but he chooses to go back or find new people to aid in his addiction. \n\nSo after his most recent arrest (6 months ago) I decided to block his prison # for peace of mind. At least Until R decided to do better for himself. Yesterday I get a call from a different prison # and regrettably answer. R tells me he accrued a massive prison debt from borrowing snacks and other commissary items (prison no no #1 don\u2019t borrow shit) and the debt has doubled and tripled. Now multiple people in his unit are telling him he needs to pay up or else things are about to get real difficult. \n\nI flat out refused. Saying we already don\u2019t have a great relationship due to his actions and I refuse to help in a problem he created for himself and likely is drug related. My brother feels like family should help regardless of circumstance and that I\u2019m letting my emotions over how I feel about him cloud my judgment as he is in dire need of help. I blocked his number and called our Mom about the situation and she supports my decision but I do feel somewhat guilty even though I know he put this problem on himself.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1681136898, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hkgcg/aita_for_not_paying_my_brothers_prison_snackfood/", "score": 217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As much as he may love you and your mother deep down, the drive for drugs is higher.\n\nSo you have an incredibly painful choice. You can either remember that you love your brother and help him regardless of how much he uses you or you can back off. Consequences and punishment are completely irrelevant.

But if you guys keep bailing him out over and over again, all it's doing is teaching him he always has a safety net... and that's one reason the behavior keeps repeating.

I'm willing to bet the answer is, \"probably NONE.\"  And that would be because he was just WAY too getting high to give a rat's **ass** about how his sleazy behavior affected YOU or YOUR future.\n\nDon't waste too much time worrying about someone who REFUSED to show you the same amount of respect most of us show the common dung beetle.", "YWBTA if you continued to enable his life-style.", "NTA.

Congratulations for learning to not enable your brother. Now work on your mom when he gets out. He needs to go directly to rehab and do the program if he messes up that\u2019s on him. Even if he becomes homeless enabling is never the answer. I was an addict and my family saved my life by not having anything to do with me until I got better.

If you still have a concern for his safety contact jail officials about the situation.  I would imagine this isn't the first time dealing with something of this nature.\n\nAlso if you continue to help him limit his resources without leaving him in need, ie. he needs a phone?  Get him phone cards, or just a flip phone", "People saying prison allows therapy that is such a joke. That depends on the state, the prison and the length of sentence. Just like the free college classes people think are available to everyone. Same criteria as before. Do not make generalizations about prison! \n\nPrison i is not about reform. They are not there to help them become better people all they do is punish people. And the United States our prison system turns out people to be better criminals. They do not give them the skills or an opportunity to try to turn their lives around.\n\nBut I digress. You are NTA. He could be manipulating you. For instance, if he is getting out soon any money you put in his books will go in his pocket when he leaves. If you borrow from someone without the means to pay it back while in prison you better be willing to take the beating.", "While your mom supports **your** decision, I'd make sure **she** doesn't enable him once **again**.

She got him into rehab twice, picked him up when he left because it was \"too hard\", the whole 9 yards.

Now in prison they generally do allow therapy and such - but the question is does he take advantage of it or delude himself into thinking what he is doing is ok - kind of like saying family helps family - though he clearly is not helping his family - just expecting them to help him.  Nothing prevents him from going to rehab but the stealing of other people's cars.  Cars are people's livelihoods - they need them for work, emergencies like going to the hospital and so forth.  So clearly, he deserves jail.", "he;s put in prison because he steals other people's cars.", "Putting him in prison is a travesty?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want treatment, he wants drugs.  He should be caged if he doesn\u2019t want to reform so he doesn\u2019t harm the normies.  \n\nHe needs consequences since he is obviously rejecting hugs.", "I mulled over two scenarios in my head. \n\n1. My brother was being truthful about needing cash for the snack debt.\n\n2. This a drug debt\n\n\nWhichever one is true. Albeit I hate that he did that to himself I can\u2019t blame myself for his actions nor can I bail him out every opportunity he creates. Theirs a strong possibility something bad could happen and would I feel awful? Of course! But\u2026. After reading everyone\u2019s comments I think it\u2019s best my brother learns to not even put himself in these situations to begin with. We as a family have done a lot for him and he keeps finding ways to fuck himself over and at some point you gotta let him figure stuff out on his own and want to make better decisions.", "Probably the best thing for him.", "Glad you mentioned limiting his resources. That\u2019s actually what we do. Cheap phones, exclusively phone cards, minimal pocket cash. Mom keeps most of his money and doles it out as needed. But he finds ways to sell his cheap phone for whatever he can get for it $25-50 etc. It\u2019s gotten to the point we try not to buy him too much since we can never guarantee he\u2019ll stay out long enough to not lose or sell it.", "Although Mom enables him to a certain degree she wouldn\u2019t pay prison debts under the guise it would implicate her in something. When he\u2019s out of prison she\u2019ll help occasionally to bail him out of anything small but she\u2019s just as tired as I am. It\u2019s just harder for her to detach herself from the situation since it\u2019s her child. She\u2019s not an uncontrollable enabler by no means so I sincerely doubt it she\u2019ll pay it", "He is driven by his need for drugs, period\n\nHe is too addicted to want to stop", "He is put in prison because he steals due to his addiction.  If he were rich I guess you would be cool with it.", "Wow, repulsive", "I 100% agree with you. I have lived with this with a family member for 10 years. Thank God he has been clean and sober for 2 years now he has his own apartment, he's a manager in a restaurant, spends time with his kids and he's doing very well he went from living on the streets eating out a dumpsters and doing anything he could for drugs to living a good life. And I think that us as a family giving him a little tough love and not paying his way and enabling him helped him get here. Every single day I worried he would be dead but I realized it was out of my control. Not to say that I washed my hands with him when he was living on the streets. I used to go find him bring him home with me do his laundry cleaning up feed him let him stay for a few days offer to get him in rehab which he would refuse and he'd go back to the streets. It took him going to jail and getting in a program finally through mental health court the jail itself all they do is punish people.", "I'm not judging your decision either way... Well, I am as NTA, but just providing food for thought. \n\nAnother alternative is to pay it, and make it clear that come rain or shine, this is the absolute last time - No matter the circumstances. \n\nIt's a way to wash your hands of the situation and any potential guilt you may feel.", "Unsure tbh I didn\u2019t really want to entertain the thought of me paying it so I didn\u2019t give him time to tell me that much. I presume it\u2019s not a small debt probably a few hundred bucks because my brother reached out to me VS mom.   Mom is the one who keeps a few dollars in his phone account and the occasional few dollars in his commissary. So he wouldn\u2019t want to burn that bridge over something like this. So he would call me to bail him out in hopes I would not tell Mom.\n\nNot to mention he recently got fired from his prison job so Mom would most likely give him an earful.", "Interesting, allowing an out of control addict to inflict harm on society is a pretty repulsive concept to me, but you do you.", "And what's your idea with the criminal justice system. Close down the prisons sent everyone to a therapist."]}
