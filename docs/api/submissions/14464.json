And I think that us as a family giving him a little tough love and not paying his way and enabling him helped him get here. Every single day I worried he would be dead but I realized it was out of my control. Not to say that I washed my hands with him when he was living on the streets. I used to go find him bring him home with me do his laundry cleaning up feed him let him stay for a few days offer to get him in rehab which he would refuse and he'd go back to the streets. It took him going to jail and getting in a program finally through mental health court the jail itself all they do is punish people.", "I'm not judging your decision either way...

I presume it\u2019s not a small debt probably a few hundred bucks because my brother reached out to me VS mom.   Mom is the one who keeps a few dollars in his phone account and the occasional few dollars in his commissary. So he wouldn\u2019t want to burn that bridge over something like this.

Old dogs don\u2019t learn new tricks unless there are zero other options.

No matter how hard you try.\n\nMy brother, who is mentally ill and has a terrible gambling addiction, will literally choose gambling over groceries. If the rumble of hunger and wasting away isn\u2019t enough motivation to change a behavior, what is?", "Insanity is expecting different results when you are doing the same thing over and over.", "Prison is to help everyone else, the people he victimizes. I'm afraid I will never understand the people that care more about the criminals that have wrecked their own lives and that of those around them through their own choices, more than the rest of us poor schlubs that are just trying to get by and earn an honest living. Don't steal my shit, don't vandalize stuff, if you do then you deserve to be locked up in prison.", "Prison doesn't help addicts it only teaches people to be better criminals. Legalize all drugs, make them freely available and use the profits to fund addiction treatment and education. You'll see crime related to drug use plummet after thqt.", "His family is being hurt and he is being hurt. With the number of addicts in this country, a complete lack of compassion is peculiar.", "Seriously this. Seattle is chock full of \"putting people in prison is repulsive\" people, hence downtown is completely trashed. Homeless junkies run the roost, your car isn't safe down there, they will break a window to rifle through it, saw off the catalytic converter or even steal the whole car. Businesses have windows that are boarded up indefinitely because they keep getting smashed. Sidewalks are littered with used needles, pools of piss and shit, and there is graffiti all over everywhere, it's disgusting. People don't seem to understand that junkies are incapable of seeking or even wanting help, all they care about is the next high and if you don't lock them up and force them to get clean they won't.", "I want to live in your world where addicts show up to their therapy appointments, we can talk about them internalizing the information later.", "I am no expert but think the OP needs some time in residential rehab.", "\"I am no expert\"\n\nYou could have just left it at that, not that it needs to be said.", "MAGA people are so needlessly rude", "you're not anywhere close to an AH", "NTA Your brother only feels like family should always help family because it benefits him. Don't bother feeling bad out guilty. You and your mother are just there to be used, as far as he's concerned. Go completely NC and save yourself the stress and heartache.", "NTA.  His issues are not your responsibility.  I understand why you would feel guilty.  He may have some difficult consequences to face in prison.  I\u2019m sorry he is trying to drag you into the problems that he has created.", "NTA- You and Mom fixing his problems every time he has them isn't helping him. He's going to need to fix this one on his own. While i don't think prison is where addicts should be, but mental health centers, he's been down this path before. He knows how much trouble he's in and that he shouldn't have done it. \n\nSometimes things get a lot worse before they get better.", "NTA. And you need to remember this. This is entirely his doing, NOT yours. Something probably will happen to him. It could be minor, could be major. But, again, it is 100% his fault. Not yours.", "He thinks family should help family?  What has he ever done to help family?  It is a two-way street.  NTA.  Do not bail him out.  If he gets out again your mom cannot be there to bail him out.  By giving him a phone and a place to stay, by picking him up at a crack house she is enabling him.", "NTA your brother needs to do his time like a man", "NTA your brother might be in jail, but he is no where near rock bottom. You are raising the bottom to where he is at so maybe he can wise up before he's dead for real.", "NTA, this is so reminiscent of my own brother.  Just the same stuff over and over again, it\u2019s exhausting.  You have to do what let\u2019s you get through life and enabling him won\u2019t help him or you.  Sadly my bro passed away, and I do wish I could get a call from him again, so maybe if you feel up to talking to him (and he doesn\u2019t spend all of his time harping for money) don\u2019t block his number but do make it clear you won\u2019t be providing money to him.", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't supposed to bail him out of his transgressions.\n\nHe is choosing his life.\n\nGiving him money enables more of this. It's bad for everybody.\n\nBut you might wat to acquire the habit of not picking up the phone unless you know who's calling.", "NTA. Crim defense attorney here and you know, like I do, there is a separate economy in jail. It\u2019s a barter system and commissary/phone time is a heavy player. They don\u2019t just want his phone time, they want to talk to other inmates\u2019 co-conspirators and victims and use it in trade. They think the DAs don\u2019t know about it. I have the recordings to prove otherwise. \n\nClearly, he\u2019s getting shady with it or else he wouldn\u2019t be in debt. So he\u2019s playing the game. Stay out of it. Just\u2026 visit, write letters, that kind of thing but don\u2019t give him a chance to play you because, sadly, he will.", "Your brother is an addict and a criminal who unfortunately owes the wrong people and worse is trapped in prison with those same people.

So that \"family helps family\" only goes one way...", "This right here. There\u2019s no point in pretending he will be taught a \u201clesson\u201d. Op is in no way responsible but I feel terrible that once they get that call they will blame themselves. All they can do is contact the prison authorities. If they pay the debt, there will be another one and another one. If they don\u2019t, he will be injured and possibly killed. But none of this is on OP.", "He most likely wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m not saying this to be heartless, but she was probably the one keeping him alive. When an addiction is that bad, all you can do is delay the inevitable. The only person that can truly save them is themselves", "Yeah but in prison this will get him killed. Not fixed. He definitely needs to pay for the crimes\nHe commented but ideally there would be rehab, then jail.", "Called \"hitting your rock bottom,\" if you're interested in the phrasing. Everyone's is different but the clients I saw who were the most successful in recovery were often shunned by family until a visible and active thought process change happened. Often there was one family member who paid for the necessities of rehab (literal necessities like delivered groceries and housing with no play money. No phone. No extras) and everyone else was no contact or low contact for their own safety. It helped enabling issues massively cause it encouraged the client to get over their own ego. Of course some just use NC/LC for pity points instead.

My family went the \u201ctough love\u201d route with my brother and sadly he chose addiction and homelessness and his eventual passing at 32.  \n\nIn my opinion you really can\u2019t blame it on the family in most cases, you do what you think is best but at the end of the day the addict has to want to get help.", "I know what it is called, just for some it's not rock bottom yet but is close enough.\n\nI know 3 different types of success stories. One is definitely what you've said and what happened to my cousin, the other is a conscious decision followed by a deliberate act, and third is them waking up one morning and going \"This is ducking stupid\" and tossing everything without a backward glance.\n\nBut yeah, I hear ya.", "Yeah, that's why I said it doesn't always work.\n\nI know a lot of addicts in my area who are only homeless addicts because of pain (emotional, physical, mental). And it ruins their ability to work, but we're in a cruel and unjust society that refuses housing-first initiatives that would resolve a large chunk of the addiction epidemic.", "Like I said, prison is to help everyone else, by keeping the dangerous and destructive people out of society. Rather than straight to prison I would prefer to see more special addiction centers specifically for addicts, where people are confined and compelled to go through treatment. They would be a sort of hybrid between prison and standard treatment where a person has to opt in.", "They already have that it's court mandated aa treatment and it doesn't work either. You aren't going to stop crime related to drug use by locking people up there will always be more addicts to take their place, you're just concentrating criminality. Legalize all drugs, make them incredibly cheap and the majority of the crimes will stop, drug use in itself is not criminal or immoral these people are sick and they need help.", "That's not the kind of treatment they need. They need to be locked up and forced into it, and not let out until they are sober. Legalizing all drugs and making them incredibly cheap or free might also work, especially fentanyl, that is a self-solving problem. The non-deadly drugs aren't going to make crime go away though, even if the drugs are cheap or free, junkies aren't adept at keeping a job so they're still going to resort to crime in order to cover their other needs. Yes they need help, but as someone that has had a few friends go down the drug rabbit hole I can tell you that once addicted they will never voluntarily try to get help and see it through, the addiction is extremely powerful. Leaving them to their own devices and giving them cheap drugs isn't helping them, it's enabling them, and unless the drugs result in their death it's not going to stop.", "Forcing people to get treatment doesn't work in fact quite the opposite, people still risk drug use even in countries where they murder addicts. The type of lifestyle that comes from drug use is from the addiction and not being able to get their fix, not the drugs themselves. There's nothing inherently evil about drugs. If someone wants to hurt themselves that's on them, adults should be able to do as they like if it's not hurting anyone rlse. Now you could say that drug use hurts others around you eventually but you could make that argument about cars too.\n\nIt's better if people can have access to cheap, reliable drugs and can use them safely rather than funding the black market. The crimes from those who traffick in the drugs are collectively much worse.", "Well then I guess the only option is to make fentanyl legal and free and hope that all of the junkies die off, then the problem will solve itself. Because offering optional treatment certainly doesn't work, and you say forced treatment doesn't work either, and you claim that locking them up also doesn't work, so not much is left. Locking them up protects the rest of us at least. I'd be ok with having a place people could go use all the drugs they want but they can't leave until they're sober or dead.", "It must be hard being this stupid. Wake up - plenty of liberal democrats believe in jail time for repeat offenders.", "NTA \n\nYour brother thinks family should help? What has he done for you or your mom? Nothing but pain.", "100% buying drugs and gambling. What prison is he at? People will stab yah 50x depending on where you are at over 10$.", "Oh man. Addictions are hard. But you gotta protect yourself. NTA", "This. The brother can't keep this up if they stop bailing him out all the time. It's sad, but it's true.", "The what-ifs are horrible. I lost my sister to an overdose in 2019 and I still go over how I might have prevented it, even though I had no say in her decisions.", "Yeah until one of your loved ones is locked up in a place with killers for a non violent offense or completely innocent and sent to a place like fcc beamont where people are murdered weekly.", "I sure hope your kids don\u2019t develop a drug problem with that attitude, you sound ignorant and it\u2019s obvious you haven\u2019t personally dealt with or had a close family member deal with addiction. Fentanyl is a self solving problem? Like I said sure hope your kid doesn\u2019t have a drug problem, karma is a mother fucker", "NTA; don\u2019t pay.", "NTA", "True but you don\u2019t have to make leaving easier by giving them a ride either.", "I don't have kids, I've always known I don't want kids. Yes fentanyl is a self solving problem, it is quite lethal, a friend of mine died from it 3 years ago. I cut several other friends out of my life when they got hard drugs and started going downhill, I don't need that shit around me. If you do what someone else suggested and make all drugs legal and cheap or free, then that problem will solve itself. For the record, I haven't seen you proposing a viable solution."]}
