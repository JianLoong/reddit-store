As i got older and was able to take care of myself, and she had grandchildren naturally i didnt spend as much time with her so our bond thinned but id still say she is one of my closest family memebrs. A few months ago she was diagnosed with cancer. It was caught too late and if she were to do chemo it'd only be a 10% chance of survival. recently her son gathered my whole family around to discuss what she\u2019d like for her funeral. Just some basic things, what flowers she wants, songs to be played, colour she wants to wear ect. Until he brought up how he wants her three grandchildren, her son and me to be there as she passes. Alot of people got slightly upset at how three young children (youngest only being a toddler) having to be there to watch their grand mother pass away. My cousin realised it wasnt a good idea and asked if id be there as im older and would handle it better. I said no. He got very upset and argued with me about how \u201cim selfish\u201d and  \u201cshe needs me to be there to make her last moments more peaceful\u201c but i just said i wouldn't do it. I do love my aunt very much and im so upset about the situation shes in i just dont feel that i should be told i have to go and watch as my aunt who i adore dies. I told my cousin i am fine with being in the house with her just not in the room holding her hand as she goes. I also said id visit her as much as i can and try to see her everyday after school if i can but he just wasnt having it. He called me an asshole and stormed off . my parents told me i didnt have to do anything i dont want to but to atleast reconsider to make my aunts last moments better. I cant handle the thought of death well and i dont think me being scarred for the rest of my life by watching someone i love die is worth it for a few last moments in someones life. i do know how hurt she will be from hearing this news but just mentally imagining it is already giving me panic attacks and i think me actually seeing it will put me into a downward spiral\n\nam i the asshole?", "created_utc": 1667602851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymd6uw/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_there_as_my_aunt_passes/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being there for her now and visiting regularly is a wonderful thing to do. \n\nI actually find it odd that her son is planning the moments of her death as if it\u2019s a thing that\u2019s happening at a known time. It\u2019s one thing to have a general idea about who you\u2019d want to inform if death seems imminent, but guilting people over not saying they\u2019d be there when it may not even be possible is odd. It sounds like he\u2019s struggling to control something that\u2019s out of his control with his plan, and that\u2019s what\u2019s causing him to lash out.", "NTA, dealing with death is awful, and however you need to do it,  is your choice, and yours alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I will say that you should try to carve out some time with your aunt before it becomes a death watch so you can remember all the good things.\n\nPlay games, tell each other your favorite memories, make sure you both know about the love and caring you share. Maybe write down some favorite things or times so she can look over it when you're not around.\n\nHugs.", "NTA.\n\nThat's an extremely difficult thing to witness and process and you do not have to do it if you're not comfortable. Don't let anyone pressure you into it.", "NTA but...I wouldn\u2019t be so sure of how you\u2019ll feel until the time actually comes. I think I wouldn\u2019t make strong pronouncements about it yet.\n\nI was there for both my parents and when the time actually comes it seems part of what one *wants* to do for someone they love. It\u2019s sad but it isn\u2019t as terrible as you\u2019re probably imagining.", "NTA you want to remember her in life. Death is not a spectacle.", "NTA. \n\nIt isn't even your aunt's wishes? No, you grieve your own way.", "No way NTA, you\u2019re 16 and they want you to go out of your comfort zone to watch someone take their last breath. I\u2019ve done this, I watched my sister pass but that was my choice and I was a fully grown adult. You were very reasonable in saying you\u2019d be in the house with her just not in the same room, that you\u2019d visit as often as possible after school, and sit with her as much  as you could. Those are all very reasonable compromises and very mature for trying to do this. Death is scary and hard to watch at any age but I couldn\u2019t image doing that as a teenager.", "Nah. You have to do what is right for you. But you also can't blame your cousin for wanting to fulfill your aunt's wishes or your aunt for not wanting to be alone.\n\nThis is just my opinion and everyone is different. I've been in the room as someone I loved died. It was a horrible experience. But there was no way in hell that I would have been anywhere else. Wait and see how you feel when the time comes.", "NTA, \n\nWhen my grandmother, who i loved dearly, was dying, all of the older grandchildren (including myself) were forced into sitting with her before she went. It was traumatizing being in that room, I wouldn't recommend it. However, is it possible that you would be able to have a longer phone call with her before every starts sitting with your aunt? Anything is better than being in that room as she goes, trust me."]}
