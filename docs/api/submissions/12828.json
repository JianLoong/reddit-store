My older sister Cassie was made be a parent before she was even a teenager. She sacrificed a lot for me and our brothers. It wasn't easy for her and was made worse when our parents were arrested days after she turned 18 and she was well and truly alone in raising us, because we had no extended family. My brother's and I will always feel like we need to make sure we appreciate her and help her as much as we can when she needs it because she should never have been put in the position she was in and she still did right by us.\n\nThat means we will often help her out even if it means... pushing some plans around. Though she doesn't know this.\n\nMy husband is aware and understands what we do and has never had a problem with it. He's not very close to  his family so he loves that my siblings and I are.\n\nEver since my sister became a mom my brothers and I have been on hand to babysit for her when she needs it. Her job is pretty crappy so often times it will be she'll be called in with no notice and need to go. Sometimes it's taking her oldest to the hospital because he has epilepsy. One of us will always be willing to babysit.\n\nMy husband has a sister who has taken issue with this. What happened is she couldn't get anyone in her family to babysit, including my husband who told her he wasn't droppings his plans with some friends to babysit for her. She asked me once everyone else said no and I told her I was on my way out to lunch but could do it after if she wanted. She told me I always drop plans for my sister and that I shouldn't pretend that I don't. She told me I should treat her like family and not like she's some outsider. That if I do it for my sister I should do it for her. I told her my sister is a special case and that I don't do the same for my brothers (cancel plans or rush to help as quickly, unless an emergency) and therefor she is being treated like family. This is when she made some snarky comments about my sister (how she fucked us over and how she wasn't deserving of so much effort from us) and I told her to mind her own fucking business. She was shocked. She told me she needed someone to watch the kids. I told her this wasn't an emergency (she was trying to plan a date with her husband and get some all day/overnight babysitting from someone) and she was being a dick about being told no. She said I was rude and was treating her like shit.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679396915, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xdohf/aita_for_telling_my_sil_to_mind_her_own_business/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not obliged to care so much after your sister. You do it because she cared for you first and showed you that she is there for you, that's why you are willing and eager to be there for her when she needs you. Your sister in law just demands it.", "NTA, you don't owe anyone justification for helping big sis. SIL is not entitled to your time", "NTA, Your sister spent her time raising you all and you're doing a very nice thing by helping her when you can after what she did for you guys and it's completely understandable why you help your sister so much. Your SIL is acting entitled", "NTA\n\nSILs ability to get \"quality time\" with her husband =/= your sister needing to work in order to keep a roof over her head.  I would tell SIL due to her gross entitlement and rudeness directed towards your family, she can forget anything remotely like babysitting or any other 'familial kindness' since family does not behave the way she did over not getting to go out for an evening of adult entertainment.", "NTA.  This isn't about SIL  feeling like you don't treat her like family.  It's. Because she is jealous she doesn't get a free babysitter.", "NTA Your SIL can mind her own business and hire a teenager to watch her spawn, just like everybody else, while she goes on date nights. She isn\u2019t special and this isn\u2019t an emergency.\n\nSometimes you have to speak plainly -really spell it out to people that want things and have opinions that they *aren\u2019t entitled to have*. You do favors for her as a *courtesy*. You can stop if you want to. \n\nYour family, ( the rest of your family), family sounds wonderful.", "Leaving your childhood out of this (since your SIL might not know about it), you are still NTA. When your sister needed help you were there for her. Your SIL wanted (not needed) help and you told her you would be available in about an hour. That wasn't good enough for SIL so she lost her temper and insulted someone you love.", "NTA, your relationship with your sister is none of your SIL\u2019s business. You\u2019re allowed to have different relationships with different people. If she wants a babysitter so bad, she can pay someone.", "I don't really know what to say about someone that thinks she should get the same treatment as your sister that gave up some of her life for you. NTA. \n\n>how she fucked us over and how she wasn't deserving of so much effort from us\n\n???? Unless there is something you didn't mention, this is 'I can't take this back relationship changing' comments.", "NTA - Just because you do your sister a favour and help her in emergencies to make up for the sacrifices she made to raise you and your brother, doesn't mean you'll have to do the same for SIL, especially when there is no emergency. \nIf I were you, I'd tell your husband about what happened, so that SIL can't surprise him with that information. But you can absolutely stand your ground. SIL can just hire a babysitter if she is planning in advance.", "Definitely NTA, First you don't owe anyone a justification for helping you sister. Your SIL is not entitled to your time. What you do or don't for your sister is simply not her problem.\n\nIf her own brother (your hubby) don't cancel his plans to help her why she expect you to do it?  You say on this post that your husband (I guess you either) is not close with his family. So what does she expected?  \n\nSo is is requesting a respect that is not giving? Please don't loose your sleep for this.", "Nta - you can\u2019t be forced to baby sit. And SIL crossed a line with some do what she said but perhaps a simple conversation explaining why either from you or your hubby is in order to explain the uneven treatment bc it is uneven in her eyes bc she doesn\u2019t know the story. Then explain outside of an absolute emergency you will need so much advance notice on baby sitting if you can do it.", "NTA\n\nThis is on your spouse, not you.  Treat inlaws like family as much as you can, but they aren't blood and you don't have years of growing up together that creates a bond.", "LOL your SIL literally compared herself with your sister? What's her iq -5? You said too little to her, you are kind and good person and your sister is lucky to have such good siblings, it seems she raised you all so well! Always be by your sister's side :))", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe anyone anything, especially not babysitting.\n\nYour SIL is being entitled.", "Of course NTA. You are not obligated to babysit for your SIL. You get to choose who you help, and why you help is no one's business but yours. I'm very close to my sisters and we would all do anything we could to help each other out. But, I don't have that relationship with my SILs; nor do I want one. Your close relationship with your sister was forged over time  through devotion, care and sacrifice.
