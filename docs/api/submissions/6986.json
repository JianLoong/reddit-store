She had a rough life growing up and had a lot of mental fallout from that, but she was a good person and did her best. My dad moved on really quickly (REALLY quickly, like 3 months after the funeral) and married Kate a year ago. I\u2019ll be honest, I really dislike Kate and her two oldest kids (13M, 12F). I do like the youngest Mark (9M), that\u2019s really the only good thing about the situation. He gets bullied by the older two on the regular, so I let him hang out in my room most of the time and he talks to me about stuff.\n\nKate\u2019s family visited for Christmas. This time of year is rough because it\u2019s when my mom died, so I didn\u2019t feel much like socializing so I stayed in my room a lot. Kate\u2019s family made some comments about it and my dad kept trying to get me to come out and do things, but I just didn\u2019t want to be around them. Mark came into my room on Christmas Eve looking like he was about to cry and gave me a hug. He said he didn\u2019t think my mom was a bad person and he didn\u2019t want me to go anywhere. Turns out that when I turned down playing games and went to my room after dinner Kate and her family talked about me and said I was going to be just like my mom and some things about her that I can\u2019t repeat. Mark overheard it and got upset.\n\nMad isn\u2019t a strong enough word. I calmed Mark down and the next morning refused to come out to open presents. I told my dad what Mark told me (but not that it was Mark who told me) and he said we would talk about it later after they left. I told him I didn\u2019t want to see them. Finally, he made me go downstairs, but I just sat in silence and only unwrapped my gift from Mark. It was really awkward. Kate tried to talk to me to find out what was wrong and I ignored her and went back to my room. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since and I avoid the older kids.\n\nMy dad says that while what they said was wrong, it\u2019s my own fault for eavesdropping and I was unnecessarily rude. I still haven\u2019t opened my presents and he threatened to take them back and I said go ahead. Kate apologized, but I know she\u2019s only sorry she got caught. The only one who doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m an AH is Mark and he got in trouble for talking back to his mom over the whole thing so now I feel bad.", "created_utc": 1673367922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108dwuv/aita_for_freezing_out_my_stepfamily_because_of/", "score": 1845, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I appreciate you sharing and seeking help in this troubling time. This is also insightful for me and how to be sensitive towards my SKs.\n\nFirst of all, your family should be sensitive towards you and your moms death anniversary. I have never lost someone that significant, so I don't know how that feels, and they probably don't either. Maybe yall could seek professional help or at least look online together to validate your feelings so they can realize it's not just you, that all ppl are a little down around this time. I am sure they may have good intentions and want you to be cheery during a wonderful time of the year, and I could honestly see how they could be initially frustrated. However, I don't think they should act on those frustrated feelings and understand u have a more serious circumstance. I am sure they would feel that sense of family if they were more nurturing to you, and then you were more open to them after receiving their live and support.\n\nIt sounds like your SM spoke in anger when she said you would be just like your mom and have her issues. That was uncalled for. Although her statement was in anger, maybe she is genuinely concerned underneath the anger. If your mom had debilitating mental health issues, maybe your SM views you going down a similar path when you are withdrawn, and she is concerned for you. Maybe if you (preferably her, but it doesn't sound like that will happen) reached out to her and said you are mourning, and I'd hope you don't confuse this with something else (such as depression,etc), maybe she would understand better. And if you are struggling with your mental health, maybe transparency would help them and soften their opinion. I really think they would be sensitive to this and want to help their child who is crying out for help, especially if they didn't have to decipher what your reactions or lack thereof mean. \n\nSometimes, people suffering deep depression or other mental illnesses can really weigh on their partners. I have no idea what happened with your mom and if this is your parents' circumstance, but possibly a reason why your dad moved on quickly. For my SO, he became fed up with the unpredictability of his ex partner and always being the villain in arguments. BM also had terrible upbringing and continuous therapy (finally in post divorce). \nI just say this, so maybe you could give your dad some mercy and grace. Maybe you could say \"I am happy that you and SM connect over this activity, and it makes me happy seeing you happy\". Sometimes offering grace and communicating this to loved ones can really heal a relationship. I'm sorry that this means you will have to take high road and be the one to be the better person, but this may lead to your true happiness. I'm sure they will recognize your maturity in this and will further soften the tension between yall.", "What was said?

My grandparents never liked my mom and didn\u2019t want my parents to get married (I know because I overheard a conversation about it at the wake and my family really needs to stop talking shit around kids I stg) My uncle might listen, but he and my dad don\u2019t get along so it might just make everything worse. My chemistry teacher asked if I was ok and said I could come talk to him if needed to earlier this week but I don\u2019t know that it would help.", "If you can't say it to their face then you shouldn't say it behind their back. If it was a real issue you were complaining about you would talk to your friend first and try to see about helping them over come it. Gossiping to other \"friends\" about something isn't actual friend behavior.", "I don\u2019t think what they said is forgivable and anyway \u201cI\u2019m sorry you overheard that\u201d isn\u2019t a good enough apology.  If she admitted that she was wrong and it was wrong of her to even say those things and let her family say them about someone she never even met, I would talk to her but they pretty much killed any chance of that ever getting beyond like coldly polite now.  I don\u2019t care what she thinks about me, nobody insults my mom on the anniversary of her death and gets to come back from that.", "> But Kate apologized. Let it go.\n\nKate let her guard down and showed her true colours. OP's right in that she's only apologizing cause she got caught.\n\nIf Kate REALLY didnt mean it, she needs to grow a spine instead of going along with her dipshit families opinions and shut that conversation down. Reeks of crass and bad taste.\n\n\nOP I see your reply below this poster. I would still encourage you to talk to Kate, or maybe explain it to your father and see if you can set a light off in his brain.\n\nWho the hell insults a child's dead parent, especially on Christmas?\n\nNTA.", "Accusing the kid of eavesdropping is often just a way for a guilty parent to play the victim", "She's also literally bullying her own step daughter!", "The mom died 3 years ago & dad only remarried a year ago. It only took 3 months for him to move on to dating other women again. Not as sketchy, but still a little weird of a scenario", "That\u2019s the big problem. OP should at least do what she can to stay in touch with Mark and offer him a roof when he gets older.", "I would basically go NC as much as possible while living there, get a job start saving up to move tf out of there.", "Guy's wife died.  He lost the person he talked to about everything. He lost the person he shared his life with. His world got turned upside-down. He was probably not in the right state of mind or making the best decisions for a while after. My brain wanted to jump to the \"Guy had the new woman in mind before his wife passed away\" conclusion but it's also pretty likely that the guy was absolutely devastated and needed someone, anyone to help him not feel like that anymore. \n\nMy brother went through something like this because he hadn't ever been alone in his adult life. He and his wife had been together since high school. He couldn't handle it and glomped onto the first disaster he found. By the time the situation had deteriorated to \"This is enough\" the girlfriend's baby daddy was living in my brother's house  and my brother was the only one paying bills. Stuff gets away from ya.\n\nHe might be in a passive \"This isn't that bad\"/\"I can deal with this, if my kid can be a bit more tolerant we can make this work\" type mindset. Sunk cost fallacy situation. This has all become normal to him. A good shake to make him see it from another perspective might be necessary.", "I have a suggestion.  You said you used to make gift boxes with your mom. What if you do that or something similar again.  Maybe get Mark involved.  There are many things you can do and help Mark along the way.  (Sounds like he needs something else to do too).\nYou can ask at school, maybe they have a program.  If not start one.\nIt would give you something to do away from home and maybe help you stay close to your mom.", "Dad should be shamed. He's letting Kate's family, who've know OP, at best, 3 years, talk shit about her and OP's mom. If there were concerning behavior it's not the responsibility of her step-mom's family to openly discuss. Dad should have shut it down.", "*her. and reading between the lines it seems like op\u2019s mom died as a result of mental health conditions, which really is an unacceptable thing to be comparing unless its out of concern alone, which based on her stepsister apologizing probably isn\u2019t the case", "I didnt address the 9 yo situation, just bc there is a lot to talk about here. Ofc, I agree the bullying of the 9yo is a huge concern. \n\nNo situation is black and white, and nearly all of the posters here are choosing to unleash their wrath bc its the anonymous internet. \n\nI acknowledged that this 16yo girl is the victim of a lot of the circumstances she brought up, what everyone else is saying.\n\nAnd yes, clearly the 16yo has to be the bigger person bc the SM and BD chose not to post on reddit or as we know seek any advice. \n\nI'm trying to give rational advice that will actually help versus just pushing her emotions to the extreme like a lot of the other users. That is wonderful she is receiving a lot of validation that she has been hurt, which I agree on, but just telling dad and stepmom to F*** off isn't the healthy option here, especially if she still has 2 years until she can be by herself", "Good for you!  Sound like you have already figured out that Kate it not someone you want or need in your life (nor most of her toxic family), but at least she gave you an awesome step brother in Mark.

Is it perfect? No. And it is recognizing that you experienced something that should not have occurred, and committing to paying some better attention in the future. In any event, she expressed some regret, and she did so as the head of the side of the family that you get along poorly with. I think that's actually very important.\n\nIt is not realistic IMO to expect perfection from other people, OR to expect them not to have opinions of their own. We are here because your father is expecting too much from you to be realistic, he is expecting perfection from you.\n\nLet it go.", "Bah, they were probably all drinking too much wine. She apologized. The family recognized they were wrong. The OP should let it go.", "Hell it\u2019s removing yourself from the situation before allowing things to get out of hand. It\u2019s the mature thing to do.", "for sure. I saw the lines about disliking the step siblings and avoiding them during the holidays etc. and thought that if we asked the step family would probably get a different story. \n\nThe whole situation sounds bad but I also see a step family that is giving gifts and trying to spend a bit of time with the OP.\n\nI edited the gendered comment in my post. I meant to use a neutral one but I slipped up.", "\"I'm sorry you overheard that\" is blaming OP's actions (the alleged eavesdropping) instead of acknowledging that Kate (and her family) said things that were hurtful.  Kate did not apologize or take ownership of her own actions, or her family's actions....her \"apology\" was for OP's alleged actions.  There's no accountability in it, and without accountability, you can't have a start to the process of healing.  Kate's \"apology\" is another way of saying \"I stand by the hurtful things that were said, you just shouldn't have heard it.\"    \n\n\nAnd is she the head of the family?  Wouldn't Kate's dad be the head of the family?  Kate's just the head of the portion that lives in the house with her.  It sounds like the extended family was saying negative things about OP.  Kate's the adult - who is supposed to be trying to bridge her old and new familys together.  Not participate in a gang up on a minor whose obviously still grieving.    \n\n\nAsking for more of an apology isn't asking for perfection, it's more OP asking for accountability.", "You\u2019re just as bad as them.", "Then call CPS and **make** him care. Pretty sure letting your stepfamily verbally bully a kid behind said kids back can be constructed as abuse, as is all the other stuff he's pulling.", "Seriously! Their response and reasoning is as infuriating as OP's whole family."]}
