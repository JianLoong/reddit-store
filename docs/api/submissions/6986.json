She had a rough life growing up and had a lot of mental fallout from that, but she was a good person and did her best. My dad moved on really quickly (REALLY quickly, like 3 months after the funeral) and married Kate a year ago. I\u2019ll be honest, I really dislike Kate and her two oldest kids (13M, 12F). I do like the youngest Mark (9M), that\u2019s really the only good thing about the situation. He gets bullied by the older two on the regular, so I let him hang out in my room most of the time and he talks to me about stuff.\n\nKate\u2019s family visited for Christmas. This time of year is rough because it\u2019s when my mom died, so I didn\u2019t feel much like socializing so I stayed in my room a lot. Kate\u2019s family made some comments about it and my dad kept trying to get me to come out and do things, but I just didn\u2019t want to be around them. Mark came into my room on Christmas Eve looking like he was about to cry and gave me a hug. He said he didn\u2019t think my mom was a bad person and he didn\u2019t want me to go anywhere. Turns out that when I turned down playing games and went to my room after dinner Kate and her family talked about me and said I was going to be just like my mom and some things about her that I can\u2019t repeat. Mark overheard it and got upset.\n\nMad isn\u2019t a strong enough word. I calmed Mark down and the next morning refused to come out to open presents. I told my dad what Mark told me (but not that it was Mark who told me) and he said we would talk about it later after they left. I told him I didn\u2019t want to see them. Finally, he made me go downstairs, but I just sat in silence and only unwrapped my gift from Mark. It was really awkward. Kate tried to talk to me to find out what was wrong and I ignored her and went back to my room. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since and I avoid the older kids.\n\nMy dad says that while what they said was wrong, it\u2019s my own fault for eavesdropping and I was unnecessarily rude. I still haven\u2019t opened my presents and he threatened to take them back and I said go ahead. Kate apologized, but I know she\u2019s only sorry she got caught. The only one who doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m an AH is Mark and he got in trouble for talking back to his mom over the whole thing so now I feel bad.", "created_utc": 1673367922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108dwuv/aita_for_freezing_out_my_stepfamily_because_of/", "score": 318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stop talking about his mother negatively.\" They were quite surprised that and while I wasn't completely fond of his mother, there's perspective at play here.

I appreciate you sharing and seeking help in this troubling time. This is also insightful for me and how to be sensitive towards my SKs.\n\nFirst of all, your family should be sensitive towards you and your moms death anniversary. I have never lost someone that significant, so I don't know how that feels, and they probably don't either. Maybe yall could seek professional help or at least look online together to validate your feelings so they can realize it's not just you, that all ppl are a little down around this time. I am sure they may have good intentions and want you to be cheery during a wonderful time of the year, and I could honestly see how they could be initially frustrated. However, I don't think they should act on those frustrated feelings and understand u have a more serious circumstance. I am sure they would feel that sense of family if they were more nurturing to you, and then you were more open to them after receiving their live and support.\n\nIt sounds like your SM spoke in anger when she said you would be just like your mom and have her issues. That was uncalled for. Although her statement was in anger, maybe she is genuinely concerned underneath the anger. If your mom had debilitating mental health issues, maybe your SM views you going down a similar path when you are withdrawn, and she is concerned for you. Maybe if you (preferably her, but it doesn't sound like that will happen) reached out to her and said you are mourning, and I'd hope you don't confuse this with something else (such as depression,etc), maybe she would understand better. And if you are struggling with your mental health, maybe transparency would help them and soften their opinion. I really think they would be sensitive to this and want to help their child who is crying out for help, especially if they didn't have to decipher what your reactions or lack thereof mean. \n\nSometimes, people suffering deep depression or other mental illnesses can really weigh on their partners. I have no idea what happened with your mom and if this is your parents' circumstance, but possibly a reason why your dad moved on quickly. For my SO, he became fed up with the unpredictability of his ex partner and always being the villain in arguments. BM also had terrible upbringing and continuous therapy (finally in post divorce). \nI just say this, so maybe you could give your dad some mercy and grace. Maybe you could say \"I am happy that you and SM connect over this activity, and it makes me happy seeing you happy\". Sometimes offering grace and communicating this to loved ones can really heal a relationship. I'm sorry that this means you will have to take high road and be the one to be the better person, but this may lead to your true happiness. I'm sure they will recognize your maturity in this and will further soften the tension between yall.", "What was said?
