He wants to go on vacation with us like nothing happened.\n\nI told him we're doing no such thing, and that he has to live with the consequences of his own actions.

He knew about this long before we did. He's not a child-child, he knows where babies come from and how they're made. If he didn't want to grow up so fast, he didn't have to do what he did.\n\nI was firm in my decision but my parents seem to think I'm being too harsh.

Gave birth to my son exactly a week after graduating. It's hard being a teen parent.  And because of this I understand OP being upset and wanting to teach the son consequences.  However,  this might be the last hurrah for him. It can also be used as a bonding moment so that the son doesn't turn into a bitter person and abandon the future children.

I think you are in denial just as much as your son. Wake up!", "Obviously, it was not explained well....", "Isn\u2019t it that parents have to pay child support if the father is a minor? If so that\u2019s gonna be a lot of child support for the next two years.", "Jacques needs a vasectomy.  I think 4 children is more than enough of his DNA in the world........", "OP said elsewhere in the thread he went through sex Ed classes and they explained safe sex with him at home. If the girls didn't have resources he did and knew better.", "Agreed! Purity culture has f\u2019d over generations of women and prevented them from having healthy, normal, SAFE sex lives with their husbands/partners.", "Have you or schools not taught your son about birth control?   I'd go on the vacation alone, because you  aren't going to have another one soon.", "Yeah. One teenaged pregnancy you can find a way to pull it together and support the young parents as best you can. But *four*? You could be a highly established couple in your 30s and have a deserved panic attack at the news of four kids all at once. And OP still has to support Jacques for at least two more years. There's little way for OP to offer much substantial support for any of the four grandkids because what they can do has to be split four ways. That is indeed unfortunate for everyone involved.", "Yeaaaaa just saw the comment clarifying it was 4 separate teenagers... oop", "Yes, that is our plan. I don't want him signing any rights off until we know for sure.", "Exactly my thought.", "What's a pregnancy pact?", "Nobody uses condoms anymore. It's terrifying and why I don't regret not dating.", "Agree, but the point is OP shouldn't be held responsible for his sons fuck up by default.\n\nUnless OP has prevented any kind of knowledge on the matter or prived their son from sex and its consequences.", "\"Nick Cannon starter kit\"  \ud83e\udd23", "Well for what it's worth it wasn't simultaneously. The girls are different stages along, he has been hiding this for a while. Overall it must have been at least a six-month period. I'm kind of devastated because not in a million years would I have thought he would have done this, especially without telling us a damn thing.\n\nIt's not really the time for laughter but your Nick Cannon reference did make me smile, thanks.", "I mean\u2026 is it that hard to lie though? The kid could\u2019ve simply told the parents he was going out with friends but instead went to meet a lady. Yeah, 4 girls is kinda wild, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be impossible for an irresponsible kid to achieve.", "omg thank u i about died laughing at \"little nick cannon starter kit \" LOL", "I know it is State by state, but I think the grandparents might have child support obligations until the grandkids are 18, not just the son, if the kids are born to a minor parent.", "And OP has two other kids behind Jacques to support and send to school.", "Yeah when I first read it I assumed twins or trips not several separate girls.", "Has he spoken to you about how this happened? 4 girls accidentally getting pregnant at the same time is a hell of a coincidence.", "I hope for everyone\u2019s sake that he\u2019s not fathering 4 babies at once. Please update. \n\nAnd NTA at all. This is a very reasonable consequence. He has work to do and money to make. I\u2019d like to spend all day laying by the pool, but that doesn\u2019t pay the bills or feed my kids.", "Update, please", "\"signing any rights off\" what the hell", "A group agrees to get pregnant at the same time and raise their babies together. \n\nAka. A real-life story turned lifetime movie.", "That\u2019s not true lol", "Somehow that\u2019s worse - he likely knew was going to be a father but continues to have sex with other girls - likely unprotected.\n\nAnd I\u2019d it is over a six month period - at least one of these girls is entering her third trimester. He has already put off becoming more responsible for several months and he is going to be a dad in a matter of weeks.", "im a bit surprised these 4 girls parents did not reach out and say something you and demand a discussion", "Based on the timelines, doesn't that mean he already knew he had knocked up at least one girl by the time he was having unprotected sex with the latter two??\n\nHonestly, this is probably fake, but if not something deeper has to be going on here. No one is that dumb. Maybe some sort of cult or something, these had to be intentional.", "Get that boy therapy.", "Dude, you really want to leave this boy at home unsupervised while you go to Miami? How many grandkids do you want to have in 2024?", "Ahhh. That changes things somewhat. Apologies if I came across as harsh, in that case. 4 girls in 6 months is still.... damn. But it makes a lot more sense how he was able to get away with it, particularly given that this is seemingly very out of character for him. \n\nYeah, but sometimes the choices are laugh or cry, so you've got to find the humor wherever you can. Best of luck to all of you.", "He has a fetish.", "100% I had a strict home life but I could have gotten pregnant if I wanted to, not 4 times, but that's simply due to the difference in economy of girls and boys procreating.", "Me too, I woke my husband up lol!", "Okay I looked it up it falls under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act and only some states do it. 13 states have this as law: Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio. Rhode Island. South Carolina, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Maryland and North Carolina extends responsibility to the custodial parent parents meaning the minor  who has custody of the child parents also have to pay child support in addition to the other set of grandparents who child is the non custodial minor parent. These states are allowed to mandate grandparents to pay child support to the custodial parent if they are under 18 and the noncustodial parent is also under 18 and can\u2019t pay. The responsibility lasts until the parent meant to be  paying child  turns 18 or is legally emancipated. If the non custodial parent  was legal at the time of conception or emancipated they will have the primary responsibility of supporting their child and the grandparents will still be liable for the remainder. If the parent meant to be paying child support stops the grandparents will still have to pay   the custodial parent child support until they turn 18.", "I doubt it was a coincidence tbh. Four times is a pretty small chance at it accidentally happening.", "He's been very clammy-mouthed about the entire thing. If it weren't for some of the girls' parents coming forward we never would have known until the babies literally popped out, I don' tthink.", "Sex I reckon", "One or some of the girls may want to give their child up for adoption. Other one's parents may want to move and not have a teenage boy limiting the decisions. There are reasons why this could be brought up. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Is it usually part of the pact that they all get impregnated by the same guy? Or is this a special twist on a \u201cstandard\u201d pregnancy pact lol", "Two of the girls' parents did, it is through them that we found out about it in the first place. We have since spoken to the other parents, one of them was just as surprised as us.", "And a vasectomy.", "Good info. Thanks.", "I think this is a special twist. This way they are all related too. All the women are now closely bonded for life through their kids and a single point at the father", "It sounds like this is a twist on a typical pact. \n\nEither none of the girls knew each other nor ran in the same circles at school and that led him to be able to do this and that two of the girls finding out about each other wasn\u2019t part of his plan\n\nOr the girls found OPs son to be mild mannered and sweet and coerced him to impregnate them all. \n\nOr there\u2019s some weird truth in between those scenarios. \n\nOP said two of the girls\u2019 parents reached out\u2014 makes me wonder if those girls knew each other and couldn\u2019t hide/deny it much longer. \n\nThe fact that OPs son is being so tight-lipped makes me believe that something is amiss here and it\u2019s not likely all OPs sons fault. Yes, it takes two-to-tango sure but it can\u2019t have been *entirely* his idea. \n\nTeenagers are dumb, but I don\u2019t know that they\u2019re *knocking up 4 girls at the same time* dumb.", "There is an episode of bones with a pregnancy pact, and funnily enough, 4 of those have the same baby daddy", "But where is he going to stay while you're on vacation in Miami?", "I\u2019m kind of shocked my state NY doesn\u2019t have this for some reason. Kind of seems all the other states give a free pass to the non-custodial parent while they\u2019re under 18 which does not seem to be fair since it takes two to make a child. At the same time I can see how some would say it may be fair  to have the grandparents help financially if the parent is still a minor  but then on the other hand I can see how it\u2019s not fair to the grandparents especially if they may not even have the financial means to take care of their child or if they have other children  and now have to support grandchildren because one child was careless. I guess the states that have this as law wants to have someone on the hook to help support the baby which is fair but I guess I just could see both sides on grandparents having to be on the hook financially ."]}
