She works out regularly, she usually has the latest makeup palette, she cycles through clothes very often.

I\u2019m going to be honest, I\u2019m not a looker, my daughter has told me dozens of times that, if it weren\u2019t for my killer personality, I would have never landed such a hotty for a wife (her mom). I don\u2019t want to feel too down on myself, but I\u2019m very large, missing more teeth than what I got and I\u2019m sure you could knit a quilt for a family of 6 with my arm and back hair, but please give it to me because I don\u2019t have any hair on my head.

I take her shopping often, we go to the shooting range whenever we can.  She\u2019s a really good kid, good grades, tutors the younger kids at her school, varsity cheer and softball.  In my wife\u2019s words, she\u2019s perfect. \n\nTo the nitty gritty, her and I went to get dairy queen yesterday and we ran into a few of her friends. They\u2019re nice, I\u2019ve driven them to softball and cheer before, but they were with a few other girls who I\u2019ve never met before. Going on, she\u2019s eating with her friends and I overhear them talking about going to the gym and working on their summer bodies and they want to be the hot seniors. They swear up and down these will be their last blizzards. I decide to butt in and tell them something like \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter how hard you work out, you will never look as good as me!\u201d  being a cheeky fucker and threw in a little dance. Carmen laughed and some of her blizzard came out of her nose and the girls I never met before made some snide comments that she\u2019s on her way to looking like me. Just a note, Carmen was the only one eating a blizzard still, she\u2019s a slow eater like her mom. One of the other girls laughed and told her she had some on her double chin. I tried to shimmy in and stop the conversation, but one of carmen\u2019s friends stepped in first and told them to leave. \n\nI ended up driving the other girls home because it turns out those two drove them there. After we dropped off the last girl, Carmen told me she hates herself and that she has for awhile. It hurt so bad, I told her she\u2019s beautiful the way she is and she said \u201cif that\u2019s true, why didn\u2019t you say anything back there? Why didn\u2019t you stop them?\u201d Although I can joke around, I find it hard to confront people, especially young girls because I don\u2019t want to be accused of anything.

If you had butted in, those mean girls would have then teased her about needing her Daddy to stick up for her.  No, I do not think you're the asshole.  What I would do is talk to your daughter and tell her you were not being mean or ignoring her pain.  You weren't sure butting in would have been the right thing to do for the exact reason I mentioned here.  But definitely support her and ask her how she thinks the situation should be handled in the future?  Tell her you want to respect her feelings and support her in every way.  Let her define her parameters and help her out.", "NtA. \n\nThere was nothing you could do. It would turn from a few teen girls bullying another teen girl to a grown man attacking/harassing some teen girls.\n\nStop talking about being ugly, it could give her the impression that it's fine to view yourself as being ugly.", "[removed]", "Your daughter does need to talk to someone. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, high school girls are vicious. You might go ahead and mention you were going to say something but her friend handled it. She should know her dad has her back and defending/protecting her is more important than impressing those girls. .", "NTA but please help your daughter get connected with a therapist. The obsession with being pretty, and crushed feelings over one snotty comment\u2026she needs to work through this.", "NTA, you're the opposite and your daughter probably wasn't actually upset with you. She probably would have lashed either way because it's a tough time to feel secure and your such a good dad that she felt safe lashing out at you. She'll probably apologize because you stepping in wouldn't have been as powerful as how her friends stepped in. The situation resolved beautifully. \n\nFyi, your description of yourself sounds like my husband, I'm also a \"looker\" and am very attracted to my husband. It's not just personality, it's character and feeling safe with my lumberjack bear man, lol, also, big strong men is a type plenty of women are into.", "NTA. Those girls were mean AH and it sounds like Carmen\u2019s real friends had her back. I don\u2019t think it would have been appropriate for you to step in, they\u2019re 17 not 7. I think you did fine. Make sure Carmen knows you love her, and if she continues to express feelings of self-loathing, think about suggesting some counselling.", "I understand your hesitation to say something especially if you're a little confrontation averse and a people pleaser. You sound like a nice person and I can see you love your daughter a lot  so I wouldn't call you an a hole. Yes you should've said something to put that girl in her place, that's not ok behavior and you are the adult here. I think it's a mistake to learn from and I would suggest to apologize to your daughter. Her feelings are valid, she just wanted to feel like her dad was on her side and it wasn't just her vs the bullies. Tell her you understand and you're sorry for not saying anything, and that next time you'll be more ready. You didn't to it on purpose though so I'll say NTA just a mistake", "NTA - it was a tough situation, and I would reiterate to your daughter that you didn't want to cause any trouble for her with what you thought was her friends. Obviously those new girls are not. I can't believe you can be that cruel that young, considering it was in front of a parent. What are they gonna say/do when they think no adults is watching? \n\nYou may consider having an external professional to help your daughter going through this last year. Just in case she needs someone neutral to open to about any problems that would come her way.", "\u201cI tried to shimmy in and stop the conversation, but one of Carmen\u2019s friends stepped in first and told them to leave\u201d\n\nNTA\n\nTell your daughter that you were about to interrupt when her friend beat you to it. That\u2019s the truth according to what you wrote. Why let daughter and wife accuse you when you were about to defend her?\n\nLooks like your daughter is taking her anger out on you because you are an easy target. The situation got shut down and by her friend. She should be happy her friends stood up for her and stood by her. Your wife should have been more understanding towards you since she wasn\u2019t there. Wife should have given you the benefit of the doubt to daughter.\n\nTry having a talk with your daughter one on one about her feelings and try to reassure her.", "NTA sounds like you have some anxiety that you should get looked at, judging by all the little jokes you\u2019re trying to put in.", "NTA my good man. If you would've put them in their place your daughter would've told you that you're embarrassing. You can't win here. But please sit your daughter down and talk with her about what she said, because it's concerning.", "NTA. Your daughter is almost an adult. She has to learn to defend herself. Also, her friend had it. Enough said. Tell your daughter as a grown male adult, unless it got physical its probably best you didn't confront them, bc in today's society that could have gotten you in a lot of trouble, and let's face it. Some females love to lie. \n\nOn a side note... Why put yourself down? If you feel your ugly, I'd suggest counseling for more self esteem, then doing something about it. Get dentures. Wax the back hair. Work out. Grow a goatee, or shave it off if you have one. You're only \"ugly\" if you don't respect yourself.", "I feel like she would have been more embarrassed if you had stepped in. Her friend who defended her was awesome, and I hope she can learn to love herself. Unfortunately, she'll look back on these years and wish she still looked like that, she just won't see it til she's in her late 20s. NTA", "The whole lot of you seem obsessed with looks.   ESH for that.\n\nBut you were right not to intervene.  No way could that have gone well.", "For all these people with the Y T A votes, you are either a child yourself or just plain dumb. The daughter would have been embarrassed either way. So, OP is NTA.", "NTA. You were in as awkward a situation as your daughter, albeit for different reasons, it caught you on the hop, and you didnt know how to react, that's just being human, nothing else. \nAs someone else said, maybe having a chat with your daughter to enable her to air her expectations of what she wants from you in that kind of situation would help, whilst reassuring her she is loved etc? \nOne thing I noticed in high school was the teachers that were good with quick, sarcastic and witty put-downs always managed to defuse similar situations more quickly and with less fallout after. My daughter has had \"friends\" insult her in front of me and I treated it as if they were heckling and I was the stand-up comedian instantly shutting them down (and then telling her to stop hanging out with them straight after). \nAnyway, hopefully you guys won't have to deal with that situation again.\nPs, like your brand of self-deprecating humour, but lighten up on yourself please!", "YTA. Go to therapy. All of you go together and individually.", "YTA for not speaking up and defending your daughter. Now please talk to her about defending herself too", "Ok", "NTA maybe though those sarcastic comments about yourself weren't a good idea. Firstly for all the reasons other posters have mentioned, also though, perhaps it opened the gates for other comments and teenagers often haven't got the judgement to know the line where teasing becomes bullying", "YTA.

You might think it makes you more confident to joke about your looks but I think it's rooted in insecurity and actually deepens negative feelings about yourself. Try to think of ways your are beautiful and don't point out your looks to others, they can make up their own opinions about you.

OP should talk to his daughter to see how she wants him to handle it in the future and ensure she is willing to deal with the possible fallout of the bullies harping on it if he says anything.

I assume their hateful comments come from a place of jealousy, because your daughter sounds lovely and she also sounds like she has wonderful parents.
