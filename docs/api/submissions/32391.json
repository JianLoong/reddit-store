I have a sister (30f) who has been trying to get pregnant for the past 5 years. This has resulted in 3 miscarriages and a stillbirth. \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant I made sure not to tell my sister, since she was grieving her stillborn, who has passed around a year ago. I told my parents and husband's parents and they were overjoyed. Out of respect for my sister I didn't have a babyshower or gender reveal or any big ceremony. Just a lunch where I announced the pregnancy to close friends and family and we all agreed to not tell my sister until we felt like she was ready to know.\n\nAnyways, I am now 34 weeks pregnant and I haven't seen my sister in over 6 months. She called me the other day, to tell me she was 3 months pregnant and things had been going well so far. I congratulated her and she invited me to her house for dinner. I discussed this with my parents and husband, and we decided it was time to tell her.\n\nI went to her house for dinner this weekend, and when she let me in she freaked out. She asked me if I was pregnant and I said i was. She started sobbing. She was absolutely hysterical. Her husband took her in to calm her down and we decided to leave.\n\nShe texted me on Monday saying that it was selfish that I was going to have my baby first and my parents would be more focused on me than her. She accused me of being cruel, and getting pregnant just to upset her. She said she would ask our parents to choose between us. This was the last straw for me. This was my first pregnancy and I wanted to do things like a baby shower and all, but I didn't because I knew it would hurt my sister. I called her a selfish, mean bitch and blocked her. Her husband called me to tell me she was inconsolable because her own sister was trying to upstage her and her baby. Our mom isn't taking sides, but my dad and husband are on my side. A few of my cousins reached out to me, calling me names, and it made me wonder if I'm in the wrong. \nSo AITA for announcing my pregnancy?\n\nEDIT: My sister has been in therapy for the past couple of years.

Showing up 34 weeks pregnant? You may as well have just shown up with the kid\n\nYour sister overreacted to you being pregnant. There's nothing wrong with wanting to start your own family. It would be similar to if you were getting married before her. \n\nYou overreacted as well. Instead of rationally talking to her like a mature adult, you just went and did the exact same thing she did by insulting her and calling her names", "ESH, her way more then you \n\nHer reaction is, maybe somewhat understandable, very harsh and selfish.\n\nBut how in the world did you think just showing up 8 months pregnant is the best way to leuk her know. You did several things to be respectful to her, but in my opinion make a bad decision in the way you told her", "ESH\n\nNobody is really a complete asshole here, but everyone did kind of suck.\n\nYou went above and beyond trying to spare your sister any pain or anguish.  You denied yourself all the things women do to normally celebrate their pregnancies, and that's laudable.  However if you hadn't gone to dinner when exactly were you planning to tell her, after the baby was born?\n\nAs for your sister, while the initial shock and reaction of seeing you was justified, her follow up conversation was just ridiculous.  Did she expect the world to stop turning until she finally brought a child to term?  That you and your husband couldn't proceed with your own lives just to placate her?  That's a completely bull crap expectation.\n\nAt this point I just hope you both have healthy, happy children.  Maybe once that's happened you two can start working on healing this rift in your relationship.", "ESH but this cannot be real, surely.\n\nObviously, obviously your sister is the AH for her reaction following the day she found out. For demanding parents pick, for accusing you of doing it on purpose, etc etc. Her husband too, for allowing the behaviour and phoning you to berate you for the same thing. \n\nBut how on earth could you think that was an appropriate way for her to find out? Going on past record, she could lose this baby too - she\u2019s only 3 months and she\u2019s had a still birth before. This is an incredibly delicate moment and she was ready to celebrate with you all. Then the attention would automatically shift to you, the imminent arrival, etc. She didn\u2019t get a chance to react well. (Though as mentioned she was appalling after).\n\nI\u2019ve seen you parents said it was fine which is was makes me think this is ridiculous. You couldn\u2019t ALL be that naive, to have hidden an entire pregnancy, avoided doing pregnancy activities, and then gone \u2018let\u2019s just turn up to her celebration at basically full term.\u2019 Can\u2019t be real.", "I lost twins at 26 weeks.  Many who have experienced this loss have irrational responses to it... it's a part of the PTSD.  That being said, you can't let your sister's behavior minimize your joy.  You should not have had to hide your pregnancy, but it might have been better to tell her over the phone rather than find out by seeing you pregnant.  Perhaps both sides could have handled this difficult situation better, but in short...NAH.", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have kept it from her for so long or spring it on her a month before the birth while she\u2019s 3 months pregnant. I know you were trying to protect her feelings but I think it back fired. Maybe you could have told her privately or with your mom, before you were totally showing, and then been able to have a shower etc. She didn\u2019t ask you not to have a shower and you technically had an event that excluded her and swore your whole family to secrecy over it. Yta for those choices, regardless of how well meaning you meant to be. \n\nHer reasoning is completely unacceptable, though. She\u2019s an AH too, although I know pregnancy and loss and grief can be very emotional and irrational. Hopefully she calms down. It\u2019s not healthy for her to stress herself like that over someone else\u2019s joy. You should be understanding of the way your choices effected her reaction and take responsibility for yourself.", "ESH you should have told her over the phone so that she could uninvite you if it was too much for her. She needs to get a grip and realize that other people\u2019s family timelines do not depend on her own. \n\nYour family dynamic is weird.", "INFO.\n\nIf she hadn\u2019t invited you over, what was your plan? Wait another 6 weeks and roll up with a newborn in a car seat? She\u2019s upset and frankly she has every right to be because her entire family kept a secret from her. That must be heartbreaking for her.", "NTA - your mother should have been the person to sit down with your sister early on and help her with this. \nShe, as her mother, is the one who should have taken on the emotional labour, and protected you. You deserve to be happy.\n\nHappiness isn't pie. You didn't take it all and leave  her with none. You aren't doing anything to her.\n\nAnd , I'm happy to be the A.H and say, after 5 years, nobody can be expected to put their life on hold so she can hope to be first.  \n\nI've dealt with infertility and loss, it's the worst thing I've had to endure, but it's not the rest of the world's job to stop revolving because I'm suffering.  That's not how life works. \n\n Congratulations.  This is a joyous thing and I hope you allow yourself all of it.", "I don't understand how you gave up all that stuff for her sake, only to show up obviously pregnant with no warning. That's just bizarre.\n\nBut while bizarre, it's not assholery. HER behavior, on the other hand, is so toxic that I'd venture to suggest she needs a new therapist. Good Lord. Did she want a baby just for the attention she'd get? \n\nNTA. She is, though, to a horrifying degree.", "you hid a pregnancy from your sister until you're literally days away from giving birth, and you're blaming her because you chose to not have a baby shower.\n\nYour sister is obviously over the top, but you chose the wrongest way possible to announce your pregnancy to her\n\nESH", "NTA. This was a lose-lose situation. If you had texted her the news beforehand (as is suggested in many infertility groups), she probably would\u2019ve uninvited you from her house and still felt the same way about you \u201ctrying to upstage her pregnancy\u201d. The whole world (and specifically your life) can\u2019t just stop until your sister deals with her emotions.", "I think everyone\u2019s missing the point by saying you \u201cwaited too long to tell her.\u201d I think you knew she would react this way regardless, and that\u2019s why you waiting so long. You did your best, but you can\u2019t fix someone with such serious issues. For her to think that you simply starting a family of your own is trying to \u201cupstage her\u201d is absurd. \n\nI might have told her over the phone, just to allow her to get her emotions out before you met in person, but I also think you\u2019re allowed to call her a mean selfish bitch bc she is! You missed out on so much trying to protect her feelings and then she reacted in that way towards you. NTA imho. You can\u2019t be perfect and let\u2019s face it: you\u2019re pregnant too and dealing with your own roller coaster of emotions.", "ESH. \n\nYou didn\u2019t ever announce your pregnancy you just blind-sides her when she showed up for dinner. \n\nYou should have told her before so she could have decided if it was something she could handle. \n\nYour choice not to have a parade of events about your first pregnancy was your choice and holding her responsible or resenting her for it is total bullshit. \n\nYou could have just had a conversation with her and done all that bullshit without her if it was too hard for her. Even with your fake self-sacrificing - she still ended up hurt. \n\nMaybe learn that it\u2019s better to have the tough conversation and not blind side people. \n\nYou\u2019re about to be a parent - time to grow up.", "ESH, leaning towards YTA.\n\nYou were definitely in the wrong keeping your pregnancy from your sister for 34 weeks! How did you expect her to react, showing up basically ready to give birth? I'd have shouted at you, too, and that's without the added trauma.\n\nYour sister, of course, is also in the wrong for thinking and saying what she did and does. It's obvious that you aren't trying to upstage her, not least of all because you got pregnant way before her. But, once again, what did you expect to happen?\n\nThere were certainly ten different ways you could have handled this situation, and all of them would have been better than what you actually did.", "NTA. Your sister needs some help. I cant even begin to dissect this one.", "ESH she obviously needs therapy, but I think in your effort to treat her carefully, you sprung an almost full term pregnancy on her. You didn't give her any time to acclimate to the new situation. If you'd told her sooner, she would have had time to process it by the time your child was born or by the time she got pregnant.", "ESH - but you didn\u2019t announce your pregnancy to her. You just showed up heavily pregnant and let her figure it out. Really sprung it on her in the worst way possible.", "YTA - not telling your sister right away or not in group settings is normal. 34 weeks is damn near the whole pregnancy. This just feels fake.", "How I miss the days when pregnancy announcements in family were a thing of shared joy. Wish you both well on your pregnancy. Be well", "ESH, you more than her. You really thought surprising her with an almost term pregnancy in person was going to be easier than discretely telling her early on and privately so she had a chance to reconcile her feelings? You also deprived yourself of things you wanted for no reason. She got hit with a double whammy, you being pregnant and that EVERYONE was keeping a giant secret from her. You were 34 weeks when the hell were you going to tell her? When there was an actual baby? At one year? 5 years? How did no one around you realize this was stupid. Your husband is the AH, your parents, and yes your sister but if I was her I'd be cutting you all out.", "NTA, your sister is delusional to think that you were trying to upstage her.  Her therapy is not working but if you want to continue to enjoy your pregnancy maybe as to attend a therapy session so you can politely let her know because of your consideration to her you missed out on so many things in your own pregnancy", "Nta. Your mom should be on your side because you didn't intentionally get pregnant and do it to upstage her. Fuck your cousins. Don't put up with your sister's bs.", "ESH.\n1. You\u2019re an AH is yourself. Have a baby shower and maternity shoot. Celebrate life.\n2. You\u2019re an AH for waiting so long to tell her and the way you did it.\n3. Your sister is AH for expecting everyone to put their life on hold\n4. Your moms an AH for not handling this all better.", "ESH. you absolutely should have told her before just showing up with a huge bump. it was cruel to do that. \n\nshe is also completely overreacting.", "NTA.  OP pregnancy has nothing to do with sister.  Half the post I was thinking that not telling her sooner was a mistake, but by the end I realized being in contact with her at all is the real mistake here.  Sister is an AH for the meltdown and drama explosion.  Also handing out AH cards to her husband for feeding into the delusional rage and any third partied who feel the need to jump into this poop show to harass a pregnant woman for being, well, pregnant.\n\nPeople are not going to stop having babies to protect sister's feelings. Not being dismissive of her journey, but that is not OP's (or anyone's) fault and blaming them is misplaced.", "NTA. Your sister needs help, the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her and her pregnancy . You still have time, so plan a quick baby shower, gender reveal etc. Everything you want. You have been selfless and given her response there\u2019s no need to tiptoe around her anymore.", "NTA, you were never going to win here. Have a baby first? Did it to upset her. Have a baby after her? Trying to steal her thunder. \n\nPlease just enjoy your life with your baby, and see if you can arrange a late baby shower/welcome party once baby is here and you\u2019re comfortable!", "ESH: Simply not telling her was a horrible tactic. I honestly can\u2019t grasp how you expected that to work out. You should\u2019ve told her one on one privately and given her space and leeway to process it when needed. \n\nThe stuff she said to you was absolutely bizarre and she\u2019s very self focused. Having a baby isn\u2019t a contest. But blindsiding her in the late stages of pregnancy was also completely ludicrous. \n\nYou both suck. Your poor mom.", "So after that conversation when she told you she was pregnant, you didn't follow up before you met in person and say \"hey, I also have some news. I didn't know how to tell you because I was worried about you and didn't want to cause you pain, but I'm also pregnant.\"\n\nI can only imagine that there are some super messed up family dynamics underlying this particular conflict.", "Surprise! Look at me all pregnant for days without telling you. It's ok though, Mom and Dad know. We all sat around, had a discussion about it and decided, as a group to lie to you for the past 7 months. Then, just for you, a few months later we got the rest of the family together, discusses your fragile mental state, and they agreed to lie to you too. For you, we all became lying asshole.\n\nYou may have wondered why the whole family has been avoiding you since the 4th of July, now you know. You should know how hard it has been for us. You should be so grateful we love you much.\n\nAbove is what I imagine your sister is thinking/feeling about now", "ESH \n\nWhilst i think your sisters reaction is way over the top and she can't demand that you not get pregnant before her. I think the fact you kept it from her for so long is really bad. \n\nYou should have told her privately.", "> I discussed this with my parents and husband, and we decided it was time to tell her\n\nYou're 34 weeks pregnant.  Did you seriously think you'd hide it now in person???\n\nSix months you didn't bring it up.  That's pretty cold.  I would understand the first 3 months.  6 months is pretty cruel.  \n\nOf course she got upset seeing you.  She found out her whole family kept a ***huge*** secret from her.   She was ready to announce happy news to everyone and you basically one upped her immediately.  That's going to really hurt.  \n\nOf course she's going to react badly.  She learned that none of you cared about her enough to inform her of what's happening in the family and that her news is basically squashed right off the bat.  \n\nHer reaction is bad.  However she realized that ***none*** of you gave her big news over ***6 months***.  To her she feels like none of you care about her at all.  I get that you thought you were protecting her, but the length this went on is just cruel.  \n\nYou're acting like you're a martyr for ***deciding*** to not do a baby shower and all.  But that's your choice.  Not hers.  Are you going to be upset if she has a baby shower?  You shouldn't because you made your choice and she be allowed to have her choice.  \n\nAnd hell you could still have a babyshower late.  You're acting like everything is her fault when you had control.   \n\nThere is no \"sides\" here.  You did hurt her, whether you meant to or not.  She reacted badly, which was wrong but understandable because of the sheer size of what you all did.   Over half a year ***by the entire family*** keeping her in the dark and immediately one upping her on her good news.   Yeah she theoretically should have handled it better but most people would break down realizing how many people had to be in on this.   You all are more concerned with picking sides rather than trying to realize what pain you caused.  You're more concerned with being a martyr getting upset that you choose to not have events instead of realizing that you should have gently discussed this with her gently ***months*** ago.   You only told her once you couldn't hide it anymore.   \n\nYou should be more concerned with apologizing for the pain you caused and explaining why you did it.  Your choice to not have a baby shower is yours and not on her so don't ever bring it up again.  You're not a victim for that.  You made a choice.   When she's in a better place getting over the utter betrayal from all of you in keeping her in the dark for so long then she'll apologize for her bad actions.  She does need to apologize for what she's said and for getting the flying monkeys.  She's not going to be in the right headspace to do that until you get off your high horse and realize you also have blame here.  \n\nESH", "Has your sister been to grief counseling?", "She needs to find a different therapist. This one isn\u2019t working out.", "Everyone is. How could you possibly not see that going well? You wait until now to tell her? Basically when you're about to pop and then spring it on her. What she said to you is absolutely insane buy I do not understand how you saw that going well waiting that long. You're also an AH to yourself. You made some major life decisions based on someone else's feelings who didn't even know you were pregnant. You missed out on important events but are blaming your sister. You chose not to have those events. You all need to take some space from each other and focus on being an adult and parent soon.", "Enjoy your pregnancy and I hope your sister enjoys hers too. I pray you both have healthy children and you all grow up and mature along the way! Good luck!", "NAH, but neither of you acted well. You did a lot to avoid hurting her, but showing up pregnant was not the best way to let her know. You should have told her over the phone or in writing, to allow her to process the information alone or with her partner. That shows that your judgement was bad, but not that you\u2019re TA. She obviously took out her disappointment and fear on you, which isn\u2019t fair. You then reacted to her unfair accusations, which escalated the situation further. The best way to solve this conflict would be if both of you can find some empathy for each other. That will probably be easier for you than for her, since she seems to be in that state of depression where you only think about yourself and how everything is related to you. I imagine that it must be very difficult to go through three miscarriages and then a stillbirth, so I\u2019m not really surprised at her reaction.", "ESH. It's understandable that your sister has issues surrounding pregnancy but she shouldn't be taking those issues out on you. What does she even expect you to do in this situation? You can't magically make yourself no longer pregnant/postpone the pregnancy so her baby can be born first. On the other hand, she never forced you not to have a gender reveal or baby shower, so you shouldn't be acting as though she did or as if you made a huge sacrifice for her considering you could have had these events during the six months you haven't seen her, and I can understand why she would be shocked to invite you to dinner to celebrate her pregnancy only to find out you are 8 months pregnant and nobody bothered to tell her.", "ESH you thought it would be ok to hide this from her, show up to her doorstep 8 months pregnant, and think everyone would clap? Tf?", "ESH x a million. I actually think you suck more. Her reaction was obviously way out of line but she's responding from a place of deep trauma. At least she's in therapy working on dealing with it. But you basically ambushed her, how on earth did you expect her to react when you showed up extremely pregnant with no warning? And she'll now know that her entire family has been keeping a huge secret for months? She could've used that time to come to terms with your pregnancy, instead you thrust this upon her with zero heads up. I'm sorry but I cannot believe you didn't anticipate this and I don't truly believe you did this all with her best interests at heart. When were you going to tell her if she hadn't asked you over? When you were going into labour?!", "ESH. It probably would have benefited everyone if you would have texted her the news so she could process it. But obviously you're not responsible for her feelings. It's definitely a messy, emotional situation.", "ESH.  Her reaction was weird (especially being mad about your baby coming first, can\u2019t help that) but your reaction was pathetic.  Your sister is grieving very traumatic experiences that you yourself said she\u2019s in therapy for.  How could you possibly think going scorched earth like that was ok?", "esh - your sister is immature and so are you. in what world did you think hiding this from your sister for this long and then just showing up about to pop would be a good idea? like did you actually critically think through how this would go????? i am concerned you are having a child if you don\u2019t know how to communicate or act with emotional intelligence.", "ESH. \n\nSo much wrong here. \n\n>she was grieving her stillborn, who has passed around a year ago\n\nGiving someone time if they just lost the baby recently makes sense. But 34 weeks? That's insane, and not helpful. On top of that amount of time, she lost her baby a year ago? What amount of time are you supposed to give her? You should have told her early, like right after your parents. You could literally go into labor any day. What was your plan here? \"Oh hey sis, here is my baby that I never told you I was going to have\"? How was that supposed to be easier for her? You told her way to late to be helpful. She needed time to process so she could be supportive before the baby came. Now, not only does she have to process you getting pregnant before her and with seemingly more ease, but the fact that everyone actively hid something from her, and that baby will be here any day. If you told her earlier, she could have had her meltdown, gotten over it, and you could have had your parties. Or had her meltdown, not gotten over it, and you could have had your parties without her because you aren't responsible for her feelings. \n\nHowever, the things she said were obviously very wrong, and not okay.", "Yta solely because it was such a silly idea to show up without warning her. \n\nYou chose to not hold those events. No one even asked this woman how she'd like to handle news about these events.", "ESH\n\nWhat did you expect would happen when you showed up 34w pregnant at her house with no heads up ?", "ESH. She's being unreasonable but did you seriously think keeping her in the dark nearly until your baby is born was a good idea?? You could have met with her privately at any time in the last 8.5 months to break the news to her and give her time to process.", "OP thought showing up with a baby would be better than telling her sister she was pregnant?! How in The world did you expect this to play out?! ESH. You should have told her way before now, I do t know how you expected this to go any other way. At the same time she seems unhinged and her reaction was terrible.", "Wait, what?! You waited to tell her for 8 MONTHS?! Then you just show up at her house about to give birth and you wonder why she's upset? Her reaction was over the top and she's an AH for her texts but you're more of an AH for waiting until you're almost due to tell her. Unless you've lived through infertility and child loss you have no clue how it can affect someone. Have some grace for her and give her some time for goodness sake. She's dealing with all her grief AND now she's dealing with knowing that everyone knew about your pregnancy and purposely kept it from her.  Once again, her reaction was uncalled for but you precipitated it by waiting too long to tell her.  In my book she gets a pass because she lost a baby and you don't because you showed up at her house 8 months pregnant without her knowing.", "ESH.\n\nYou should have told her sooner.\n\nAlthough your sisters was also an AH about this, I feel sorry for her.  4 times now she's been pregnant and failed to have a baby.  She's got to be terrified that this may happen yet again, reminding herself that getting through the first 3 months successfully is a really good sign that this time she may finally have a healthy baby.  Then you just wander in the door 8 months pregnant.  That had to be a gut punch to her, as if you were rubbing all her failed pregnancies and saying, \"See, this pregnancy stuff is easy.\"  She probably had been telling herself things like, \"Well, at least the baby will still be the first grandkid\" to console herself for all her losses.\n\nHas she been handling things well?  No.  You were nice about not doing a baby shower, but it would have been better if you'd let her know you were pregnant much earlier then gone through with the shower with the understanding that she wouldn't attend for her own mental health.", "NTA.  Hopefully she hashes this mess out with her therapist because it doesn't sound like she's made much progress on her issues.  Have your shower and gender reveal if you wish.

Unfortunately, she has suffered an immeasurable loss, and the years of therapy have yet to lessen her intense pain. She\u2019s irrational. Wish her the best as I do for you. Perhaps the passage of more time(and the arrival of her baby)  will help heal her wounds.", "ESH but mainly you because YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD HER FIRST. It was going to happen no matter what and she needed time to process. You could have told her via text before your reveal dinner and let her decide how much she wanted to see you/ be involved in the process. Instead, she knows nothing until you show up at her door 8 months pregnant?? She shouldn\u2019t have acted like you were having a kid to upstage her, but she certainly has the right to be shocked that she\u2019s not going to have the first kid - she thought she would for the last three months!

I\u2019d agree with them but I think you and I have similar sisters and family dynamic with the said sister and if you know you know and if you don\u2019t then this seems unfathomable and hard to digest. My sister is demented. Just flat out she is. She takes everything to nuke level no matter what it is.  I\u2019m limited in this comment to give full and robust context but in this context of this post she and I are getting to the ages where marriage and babies are expected and she\u2019s found out she\u2019s infertile and I honestly feel really bad for her on that. I don\u2019t know about myself but what I do know is if I ever do get pregnant she\u2019s going to be an absolute monster. Not just to me but also to my child and everyone else. She will also force the family to choose sides. She would be hurling the same crap at me that your sister did to you. And take a step back for a second and pretend you are a third party looking into this. The crap she\u2019s spewing is insane. Off her rocker insane. You did all this out of spite?? Jesus h Christ give me a effing break. Women will get cut slack on being infertile (as they SHOULD) and there\u2019s an unspoken rule to not do or say anything to trigger that topic for them. Okay fair enough. But there\u2019s limits to everything. Would it be fair to you that you never get pregnant or follow through with a pregnancy bc of your sister\u2019s feelings? Everyone here griefing you on missing out on a baby shower\u2026 they haven\u2019t dealt with people like that. If this were me and my sister she would go ballistic if I had a baby shower going on how it\u2019s not fair and it would result in our parents telling me to forget about it due to my sister. It really should be no big deal if you had one but you and I both know the truth of family dynamics like this. It\u2019s so easy for people on the outside to quickly judge the situation with zero knowledge of what\u2019s going on and nor do they want to. It\u2019s easy for them to say you clearly are the one at fault. I feel bad you had to not opted to forgo a baby shower and again people who have not experienced people and dynamics such as this will attack you like you are seeing in these comments that your sister didn\u2019t do that YOU did. No. Again it\u2019s easy to judge from the outside but if you are on the inside of a family dynamic like this then you know if you know. There is so much more I want to say but I won\u2019t.

I have a sister (30f) who has been trying to get pregnant for the past 5 years. This has resulted in 3 miscarriages and a stillbirth. \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant I made sure not to tell my sister, since she was grieving her stillborn, who has passed around a year ago. I told my parents and husband's parents and they were overjoyed. Out of respect for my sister I didn't have a babyshower or gender reveal or any big ceremony. Just a lunch where I announced the pregnancy to close friends and family and we all agreed to not tell my sister until we felt like she was ready to know.\n\nAnyways, I am now 34 weeks pregnant and I haven't seen my sister in over 6 months. She called me the other day, to tell me she was 3 months pregnant and things had been going well so far. I congratulated her and she invited me to her house for dinner. I discussed this with my parents and husband, and we decided it was time to tell her.\n\nI went to her house for dinner this weekend, and when she let me in she freaked out. She asked me if I was pregnant and I said i was. She started sobbing. She was absolutely hysterical. Her husband took her in to calm her down and we decided to leave.\n\nShe texted me on Monday saying that it was selfish that I was going to have my baby first and my parents would be more focused on me than her. She accused me of being cruel, and getting pregnant just to upset her. She said she would ask our parents to choose between us. This was the last straw for me. This was my first pregnancy and I wanted to do things like a baby shower and all, but I didn't because I knew it would hurt my sister. I called her a selfish, mean bitch and blocked her. Her husband called me to tell me she was inconsolable because her own sister was trying to upstage her and her baby. Our mom isn't taking sides, but my dad and husband are on my side. A few of my cousins reached out to me, calling me names, and it made me wonder if I'm in the wrong. \nSo AITA for announcing my pregnancy?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Same goes for you. \n\nBoth of you need to chill out. Life is not a competition. There is no \"prize\" for having a baby first. Nobody got pregnant intentionally to spite anybody else. \n\nIn the words of Chili Heeler, \"Run your own race.\" (And if you don't know what I'm talking about, go watch the episode of Bluey called \"Baby Race.\")", "ESH - you made a choice not to tell your sister.  Your not having a shower is on you.  Also genital reveal parties are tacky and no one should have", "NTA", "NTA at all. You were extremely sensitive to her and sacrificed many of the experiences that you were entitled to have as a first-time parent yourself. And she STILL got mad at you, acted as of having the first grandchild was some type of conquest that she was entitled to, then stated that she was going to purposely try to create hurtful divisions in your family?? She sounds evil, TBH. Having a baby is not some kind of contest and she is not inherently allowed to have one first! It is ridiculous for her to expect you to put your life on hold, for her to not appreciate the lengths you went to in order to safeguard her feelings as much as possible, and then to verbally abuse you. You are not to blame for the fertility issues they have experienced (no one is, of course) and did not deserve to be treated that way. Just awful! Congratulations on your baby abd I am so sorry you had to deal with that!!", "I guess ESH but if I were you, I would have had the shower, the gender reveal...whatever you wanted to do. You shouldn't have to walk on eggshells and not enjoy your first pregnancy experience. That's absolutely ridiculous. \nYour sister is a real piece of work. Wanting your parents to \"pick\" one of you? Wtf?\nYes, I think you should have told her privately at the beginning or at least before you showed up at her house obviously pregnant. But her reaction is absolutely outrageous. She should be happy for you and excited to be not just a mom finally but also an aunt. This behavior is so fucking wild to me. I only put ESH because of how you told her...or didn't tell her. Other than that she is a major AH. Maybe she needs a new therapist.", "NTA\n\nYour sister's logic isn't sound. No one has a baby to spite someone else. You could have shown more compassion or foresight in telling her sooner, but considering her reaction, i can't exactly blame you for your decisions.\n\nCongrats for the mostly smooth pregnancy, but i really don't think barring yourself from cultural pregnancy practices is justified just to be considerate to your sister.

I would hope that some day down the road it\u2019ll be obvious this isn\u2019t truly her reacting but the pain she\u2019s been through regarding pregnancy and motherhood. Pain says and does some awful things. She has no right to call you selfish, attack you or expect your parents to choose between you. But like I said, she\u2019s in pain, and because she didn\u2019t know you were pregnant she already had established expectations that she was finally going to be the one to deliver the first grandchild and be in the spotlight for something that isn\u2019t sad for once. Absolutely none of that is your fault or anything you did wrong but she will need time to grieve the loss of what her expectations were in this scenario. If it hasn\u2019t happened already, your parents or another trusted friend or relative should really approach her about getting some grief counseling/therapy.

Just a lunch where I announced the pregnancy to close friends and family and we all agreed to not tell my sister until we felt like she was ready to know.\n\nThis is, frankly, ridiculous. While considerate, her grief should not stop the rest of the world from turning. This is not to minimize the grief and loss of a child, far from it. But if we all played by these rules we would eliminate all sources of life, light, and joy from the world.\n\nIf she is bothered by you having a child, that is something she needs to work through.

She is not processing or accepting the loss of her child. Her expectations that the world will stop and wait for her are not rooted in reality. This is a her problem to solve.\n\nYou are not selfish for having a child. Nor for announcing it. You would not be selfish for having a baby shower or gender reveal. These are milestones you can, and should, partake in.\n\nYour sister needs grief counseling.\n\n>I called her a selfish, mean bitch and blocked her.\n\nWhile understandable in the moment, this likely didn't help. I'm not going to change this to E S H mostly because she was pretty deplorable first, but given that it was rooted in unprocessed grief, it makes it a bit understandable, even if it is unacceptable.

You also robbed yourself of a baby shower on her behalf without even talking to her about it. Calling her a bitch and whatever else you said was obviously terrible.. You did not respond well at all, but you were met with a wild reaction and you have tons of pregnancy hormones, so you may not have reacted that way normally.\n\nHer reaction was also way overboard and not good at all.

But, you have the right to have children if you want. It\u2019s not your fault she\u2019s had such a difficult time having her own.

Also, there isnt really a time stamp for grieving. \n\nYou are an ass for not coming clean sooner.\n\nShe is also an ass for not celebrating you are both on the journey together. Sounds like she wants the attention.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve told her privately a few weeks in. Don\u2019t blame her for you not doing a shower or anything. You could\u2019ve done it with the others or something.", "Both of you are TA. As someone who has struggled with infertility and miscarriages, I have watched friends and family give birth multiple times in these past 9 years. As much as it hurt, it was also exciting and I've become the surrogate aunt to all of them.\nYou definitely should have sat her down and validated her feelings of loss and told her you were pregnant. Give her time to process her feelings and decide if she wanted to be a part of any celebration you had. Maybe even let her help plan if she felt comfortable enough.\nShe had every right to be upset with you showing up so far into pregnancy. She probably felt as though everyone around her had been lying to her. She definitely overreacted but grief can do that to people. Especially after a loss so impactful on your life. (My sister did not attend my wedding because she had to have an abortion due to health issues and did not tell me due to not wanting to hurt me. I was upset for so long that she didn't come and never understood why. I believe that abortions can be used for legitimate reasons but not as a form of birth control. But for me, I would never just because I have struggled with getting pregnant so long, that I would want to try no matter what. Abortion for me, is not something I believe in.)\nShe definitely overreacted by asking your parents to pick but again, she also feels as though she's been being lied to for 34 weeks. That's a lot to handle while grieving. Especially when your hormones are all over the place.\nAs for your baby shower and reveal, you chose not to do those things. You cannot be upset with her because she never asked you not to. I would announce your pregnancy and gender on social media at this point. No use getting everyone together so late. Then do what a friend of mine did and have a \"Welcome to the World\" party where people can meet the baby and you still treat it as a baby shower. This also helps with knowing what size baby will be and avoid all of the items that won't fit. You also will have a good idea on what you actually need since I'm sure you've been buying this whole time.\nGive your sister time to come around and try explaining why you did what you did.

Always thought that was about the most compassionate approach you could get -- if you're grieving loss or something, it's going to hurt no matter what.

From what I\u2019ve learned, earlier is probably better when it comes to telling a loved one who struggled with infertility about a pregnancy.

Now you're going to be dealing with the additional fallout because when she does stop and settle, she will have a very real reason to be angry with you about how you handled this. Worst of all, you kinda dragged your parents into this, too, who should respect your wishes in regards to the pregnancy, but lied and hid things from their daughter in the process.

If being \u201cfirst\u201d or the center of attention is more important than family well then that\u2019s a sad life to live. It seems as though op was in a lose-lose situation.", "she deserves grace, not a pass to treat people how she has. \n\nOP didn\u2019t get a baby shower, gender reveal, or *anything else* most, if not all, new mothers get because she was being considerate of her sister. unless she has a second baby and decides to do that, she lost the chance to fully indulge in and enjoy her pregnancy. is that the sister\u2019s fault? no, but it *does* speak volumes on how much OP cares for her sister and understands the grief. *that* is extending an incredible amount of grace to her grieving sister. \n\nthat said, i do think OP dropped a bombshell just showing up with a big pregnant belly with no warning. she should\u2019ve done better in that part. \n\nwhat was unwarranted and *doesn\u2019t* get a pass was saying OP was selfish for not letting her sister be the first to have a baby, or to say OP is stealing attention and trying to make their parents pick sides. regardless what happens to someone personally, life goes on. it\u2019s not right to insinuate there was an expectation that OP not start a family because of the stillbirth her sister experienced.", "I\u2019ve had a couple of miscarriages and a stillbirth.  I did have one baby before the stillbirth and the miscarriages came between babies.  That said, I never saw any connection between my experiences and other people & relatives having babies.  We were just in two separate journeys.  It\u2019s not as if the sister having a baby means the other one is going to lose her pregnancy.  It\u2019s just life.  The sister might have needed to get more attention from the family before this time. I suspect she did.", "And that sucks for the sister, but the OP seems to have bent over backwards to try and be considerate.", "So since she went thru a stillbirth she gets to dictate other peoples reproduction? Like should OP have gotten her pregnancy pre-approved? When does still birth veto power end? It\u2019d already been a year so like is it eternal? Is she the family womb master for life? Fuck ALL that", "The sister seems awful. Her First though It wasn't hurt about OP not telling her, It was because she wouldn't have her parents undivided attention...", "True. She should have had a huge gender reveal party and baby shower. Her unstable sister would have surely enjoyed this. Making her parents pick her over her sister. How could she have her baby before her. The women needs therapy and she about to bring a child into a already fucked up world that doesn't need more children? Esp with a unstable highly emotional and manipulative future mother. Yikes.\n\nLets be real. If she did tell the sister earlier on she would have been just as upset.", "Because people blindsided often lash out about many things whether they make sense or not.  \n\nThis is a pretty well known concept.", "The sister views OP's pregnancy as some conspiracy to take attention away from her. OP didn't do any of the celebrations of being pregnant for the feelings of her sister. If we're honest, if OP did do them, the sister would have thrown an even bigger fit and ruined it anyway. OP was trying to be kind. It's not right that OP need to strategically calculate the best time seeing as the sister is pregnant herself. What does the sister need kid gloves for? She is pregnant too.", "They were trying to be kind. It didn't work out, but with the psycho sister that was probably unavoidable.", "She might have misjudged it, but the motivation was decent. The sister could have made it NAH with a decent apology, but the extended arseholery makes here the clear arsehole.", "Yes for comments like that sister is also AH and I'm saying ESH.\n\nBut really, you've never yourself, and never known anyone in a state of intense trauma and emotional distress said things they regretted or disagreed with later? I for sure have been angry and said things I didn't mean. And that's a heck of a lot weaker of the intense feelings of loss and betrayal sister had to deal with.\n\nYes, maybe she totally meant that and we'll see, but reasonably I think she'll come to the conclusion that despite everyone lying to her, that still makes no sense. It's a fifty fifty and taking that as a hard fact/stance of the sister makes no sense to me either, it's just as likely to be emotionally based.", "There's no time limit on grief and it's not even the slightest bit strange to be \"still\" mourning a stillbirth from a year ago. The term stillbirth is key here - this wasn't an 8 week miscarriage but likely a baby that her sister had been carrying for 28, 30, 34 weeks. The baby had a name and a nursery. We obviously have no details about the circumstances, but sister might not have even had warning until she didn't hear the baby cry.  \n\n\nIt would not be out of line to say that it could take years of professional help to reach a new functional normal after a stillbirth. That might not be true for everyone, but probably more likely for someone who has already gone through 3 miscarriages.  \n\n\nI can think of few things more traumatic. And I say this as someone who found my closest friend dead in her mid-30s at home in her apartment.", "> If sister is still too emotional to tell her about another\u2019s pregnancy,\n\n*Because it was hidden by the entire family behind her back for over 6 months* and OP arrived without warning her of the big secret until showing up.  \n\nI've never had a miscarriage (let alone a ***stillbirth***).  I would still be upset if a sister of mine showed up to an event heavily pregnant because it meant everyone thought so lowly of me to cut me out of family information.  \n\nIf you had a graduation party and your sibling showed up going \"oh yeah BTW I also graduated from university and didn't even tell you I was attending and I did it before you so don't go around telling everyone you're the first with the degree\" at ***your*** graduation dinner, wouldn't you go ***wtf???***\n\nThat's basically what OP did.\n\n-----\n\nAlso are you aware of what a stillbirth is?   It's ***very*** normal to be grieving those for years.  \n\nShe went through birth.  She had a baby.  That baby was dead.  \n\nThat is a life shattering trauma.  Miscarriage is already difficult.  Stillbirths are so fucking traumatic that some people never recover.", "Grieving your dead baby a year after it died is not abnormal, that\u2019s an insanely unkind thing to say. I\u2019m not going to try and argue about your opinions about the sisters feelings but don\u2019t state that shit as facts when it\u2019s not. It\u2019s absolutely normal to grieve *any* loss for a fucking year.", "Yep. Me too.", "I think the issue would be more that she kept in the dark for 8 fucking months.\n\nAnd not only that, the rest of the family knew and kept it from her. Do that the *first* idea she has that her sister is pregnant was seeing her obviously nearly about to pop. I'd be devastated and I haven't struggled the way OP's sister has. The sheer effort to keep that new from her and the  to spring it on her I  public *at her own celebration* fucking ridic", "That's a bit harsh.  Sister just found out her entire family has been lying to her for 8 months to keep her in the dark about OP's pregnancy.  Then OP shows up to sis's pregnancy celebration dinner 8 months pregnant without even giving her a heads up.  I can see her being blindsided and upset by that.", "This deserves wayyy more upvotes", "presumably womb mistress.\n\nThat said, the OP is clearly a spiteful cow for not getting her tubes tied in sympathy. /s", "When others react backly to your normal events its not your fault.  You are partially at fault if you handle the situation badly and they react as a result.  \n\nOP would have been in the right to announce her pregnancy and have the shower.   She's not in the right to wait until the third trimester, show up to her house without giving a heads up of her pregnancy, and everyone else being in on it.   That's cruel.  OP is partially at fault for the fallout then.\n\n> Lets be real. If she did tell the sister earlier on she would have been just as upset.\n\nAnd OP wouldn't have been an AH.  Her being upset isn't what made OP an AH.  The sister is an AH either way.  \n\nThe choice was should OP be an AH or not with the sister having the same reaction.   That's on OP.  It's no excuse to be cruel.", "I agree..and where will it end? Once sister has her child( and after everything this poor woman has been thru, I sincerely pray that she has a safe pregnancy, delivery and a healthy baby) unless sister gets the mental health care she so desperately needs, there will be a constant hysteria by sis anytime OPs baby is mentioned or admired by family.. because in poor sister\u2019s mind, HER baby needs to come first\u2026I feel terrible for both these women, OP because her entire pregnancy couldn\u2019t be truly enjoyed out of fear of her sister\u2019s reaction , and for sister, whose tragic prior pregnancy experiences have rendered her incapable of handling her OPs pregnancy. I hope they both get the help they need so that the rest of the family doesn\u2019t feel torn, and these 2 little cousins can be close", ">If you had a graduation party and your sibling showed up going \"oh yeah BTW I also graduated from university and didn't even tell you I was attending and I did it before you so don't go around telling everyone you're the first with the degree\" at ***your*** graduation dinner, wouldn't you go ***wtf???***\n\nAdd \"oh, and everyone else in the family totally knew about it, and we all agreed not to say anything to you\".\n\nThe sister's immediate reaction was shitty, but it's also a knee jerk reaction to what was likely perceived as an intense betrayal involving the thing she is most insecure about it in life. She also wasn't given the opportunity to process the information and work through those reactions privately.", "Could someone explain this to me. Both Opie and Sister are main characters, just not in each other's stories or am I missing something? Please and thank you.", "Yeah because saying OP got pregnant to be cruel seems normal, seems like sis would only have not freaked out if OP waited until sis had already had a baby and got to be first", "She was going to be \"blindsided\" no matter when or how OP told her.", "But Opie did as she was counselled by numerous people even her parents. Was it the right decision, possibly not. But hopefully she now knows she was damned no matter what choice she made. \n\nNTA.", "Exactly.  People react badly when they've been betrayed.  I give that way more grace than a conspired 6 month long chain of decisions.  OP sprung this on her at ***her celebration dinner***.  How cruel is that?\n\nIf OP had told her during the second trimester or called her in advance to warn her or ***anything*** then OP would have been in the clear.  Someone wouldn't have made these choices without wanting to hurt the sister.", "The difference is the sister is not willing to let the OP live her life and have her baby without throwing fits. You don\u2019t get to stop someone else from living their life because you couldn\u2019t attain what they have.", "She was mean and probably not dealing well with her grief to begin with since the family felt they had to hide stuff from her, but knowing that she's not handling pregnancy related things well why would you just surprise her with a big pregnant belly? If sis knew ahead of time and still reacted like that OP would be in the clear, but she definitely shares blame when she purposely made it a surprise.", "And then OP could have avoided going to the pregnancy announcement and all the resulting drama, and sis could have had her pity party without OP. But really, I'd be upset too if my sister rolled up 8 months pregnant and didn't tell me. Sis overreacted big time, but that's a huge thing to hide.", "I don't think there was ever a good time to tell her. OP wasn't being malicious and did the best she could in a lose lose situation.", "Why would you get pregnant if you can't handle pregnancy related things well", "Grief might explain an immediate response, but the ongoing arseholery is all on the sister."]}
