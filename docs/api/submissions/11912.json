You knew an 8-year-old child was coming to the party and would only be able to eat fruit. It's really not that hard to have a side of mac and cheese, or pb&js or something else for her to eat that the other kids would eat also. If you KNOW and INVITE a child with dietary restrictions to a party, it's bare minimum to make sure they have something to eat. You don't have to change the whole menu, but make sure the kid doesn't go hungry.\n\nEDIT: Regardless of whether OP knew in advance, the *minute* the kid came and said \"Hi I can't eat any of this\" the answer should **not** have been \"Have the fruit, I guess\" it should have been \"Oh no, what can I make you?

Yep, all of them. \n\nIt's not that hard, and it's not that pricey.\n\nAnd, in this case, it was ONE kid, with specific issues - and OP knew and didn't care. 20 to 1 the kid is Muslim.", ">So, for a party of 10 people you must consider alergies, vegan, vegetarian, kosher, gluten free, dairy free, fat free, low carb, non sugar food to acomodate?\n\nYes. You ask about food allergies and dietary restrictions, and then you plan food accordingly. That's being a good hostess.", "Yeah, when you host a party you have to keep in mind everyone you are inviting needs especially when you know a head of time. This is a child. OP an AH.", "Please don\u2019t host any parties.", "Your first two sentences were right on. You plan a party? You plan for ALL dietary restrictions of those you invite.", "Nobody is saying you have to plan for all those. But this child's restrictions were known to her while planning the party. If you offer to host someone who you know doesn't eat certain things, it's only common courtesy to plan for that", "Exactly.. back in the day it was party pies, tomato sauce and a cake. And people wonder why their kid doesn't get an invite.. NTA", "I just saw where OP replied to another comment saying that she knew ahead of time. Render judgment as you will. lol", "How do you know she knew ahead of time? Also a party is not a meal.", "The child\u2019s mom is the AH. She probably said nothing to OP and was snappy when her child wasn\u2019t automatically accomodated.", "Do you know that OP knew about the dietary restrictions? Did this parent ever call OP to confirm that she knew? It\u2019s the parent of that child\u2019s job to call OP to see if her child would be accomodated or if she needs to pack something.", "Oh I don\u2019t blame the child, I blame the child\u2019s mom. She knew that her child was going somewhere and would likely spend a meal time there. Why would she not pack a snack for her, just to make sure she had an option?", "It doesn't work like that. Most people who are vegetarian (for any reason) or refuse pork (for any reason) won't eat something that had ham on it.\n\nAlso, the kid was served fruit. Just fruit. And it's not a \"doesn't want to\" eat meat. The child has been raised not to eat meat. I doubt the child had any say in her diet.", "For some people, removing meat is not enough. In essence it\u2019s been contaminated. That being said, it wouldn\u2019t have been hard for the OP to make a few cheese toasts sandwiches leaving off the ham, huh? Actually less work. \ud83d\ude09", ">Op also could have left a baked potato plain, or adjusted the mixture for one. Or put the toppings on the side for her.  \n>  \n>Like you said, a toasted cheese sandwich would have worked.\n\nI don't get what was wrong with the chicken tenders...", "It was probably a no-bake, which usually call for gelatin. \n\nThe potato would have been so easy. I don't even dress potatoes for my own family. I let them choose the toppings. A potato bar sounds like a lot of fun for a bunch of kids that age!", "Hostility towards a child practicing a particular religion is one way to explain it.", "Then the 8-year-old's mom is the AH in this situation.", "No she didn't.", "Cool. So you can bring your own food instead of being fussy.", "She did per the OP. The OP made an active choice not to offer the child anything other than fruit despite stating a meal was being served.", "Did you tell girl's parents that you would not have items that cater to their religion?", "Be forreal op. Why not just make the kid a plain cheese sandwich and a non-meat baked potato if you knew? What's up?", "Then, yep. YTA! Congratulations!", "You knew a child was coming into your home and that they'd be able to eat next to nothing.  What a fabulous hostess. That'd be shitty to do to an adult guest.  Being shitty to a child is even worse.  YTA", "You are still much TA. And the fact that you're asking if you are considering they you knew makes you ten times the AH because you're still going to be one in the future regardless of what you read in this thread", "You really couldn't offer her a plain potato, a non-ham sandwich and a gelatin-free cupcake? \n\nAnd if you couldn't offer those why didn't you tell the mom in advance so she could provide her child with a meal and dessert she could eat? Why the passive-aggressive behavior towards a small child who is a guest in your home?", "For something that crazy strict, girl's parents should damn well have discussed the menu with the host.", "I worked in an engineering lab in college (in the US) and 1 of the PhD students was from Iraq and only ate halal meat. We had a summer barbecue and what did our PI do? He drove to the international food market in town to get halal certified meat and served it to everyone at the party. I respected him a lot before, but damn I respect him even more now because of that. Our PI is veryyy Catholic btw. If a Catholic guy from rural Idaho can come up with a suitable accommodation for a Muslim student with dietary restrictions, you can too.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to be considerate and make a pb&j sandwich. YTA", "There was fruit and carrots/dip. She could have picked the meat off the sandwich. The world isn\u2019t going to cater to her kid, she better get used to it.", "I saw her response. So, so wrong.", "Yeah! Back in the 50s, before Muslims existed! Wait\u2026", "It's literally a meal. She made sandwiches, made several sides, and a dessert. Check op's comment history. She knew and made an intentional choice to not have enough food this child could eat. It's an AH move to let one kid at a party sit there and watch all her friends eat and she only has some fruit.", "Nope OP said in a comment she knew. So she knew ahead of time the child couldn't eat something. OP is still an AH whether she knew ahead of time or just found out. People trying to justify being a rude host is amazing.", ">Most people who are vegetarian (for any reason) or refuse pork (for any reason) won't eat something that had ham on it.\n\nThen they're being absurd and I don't respect their position. \n\n>Also, the kid was served fruit. Just fruit.\n\nWhich is a delicious and nutritious meal option when you don't eat meat. There were also carrots. So they were served fruits AND vegetables. \n\n>And it's not a \"doesn't want to\" eat meat.\n\nIt's based on religion. It's a \"doesn't want to\" scenario. Zero health risks were involved.", ">For some people, removing meat is not enough. In essence it\u2019s been contaminated.\n\nOoogady Boogady nonsense? Yeah, gonna go with BS on that. That's not an opinion I'll respect.", "The person you're replying to is hell bent on this argument. They're all over this thread saying they don't respect religious opinions or whatever and no one has to cater to someone else. I'd just let them be.", "I was wondering that as well. \n\nBut then I realized that there are several religions with dietary restrictions. \n\nSo maybe it's not meat products but a vegan diet? \n\nOr the chicken tenders were minced chicken product that might include organs? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I suspect this girl is following either a halal or kosher diet, either of which don't include chicken not killed and handled in certain ways.", "Ahh, I forgot they have those in a box. Thanks! \n\nAbout the potatoes, it was a missed opportunity, kids l9ve doing that stuff at that age.", "Xenophobia perhaps?", "This is actually what's going on here and op has come to the Internet to validate her shitty bias, it's crystal clear", "It sounded to me like the 8yo mom\u2019s expectations of food restrictions were communicated in advance.  Had OP communicated her unwillingness to comply in advance, I would agree with you.", "Yes, she did. Fruits and veggies is not filling nor a meal. She an AH>", "That works for adults, not 8 year-old children. Even then, it's really rude to know a guest has a dietary restriction and not make something they can eat or at least coordinate with them to make sure they know there won't be much for them.", "Orrrr don't invite someone to your home for a meal, knowing their dietary restrictions, and then refuse to feed them an actual meal.", "Most of the time people who follow halal or kosher laws are more than happy with vegetarian options. I have a close friend who's Muslim, and she's fine having a vegetarian dish when there's no halal options. It's really not that hard for OP to just have made a couple of cheese sandwiches or something. She didn't have anything, except fruit and carrots, without meat. \n\nEven not thinking of specific restrictions, it's literal common sense to offer a vegetarian meal at any party.", "They did. OP still chose to exclusively serve a bunch of food this kid couldn't eat.", "It\u2019s not crazy strict. Literally anything vegetarian works just fine.", "Probably. That said, it\u2019s not that hard to provide an option. I had friends that ate only halal food growing up and we always just made sure to have a vegetarian option- frozen vegetable spring rolls from the supermarket did the trick. OP could have also provided some individually wrapped chocolates for them too or vegan lollies like sour patch kids since they usually can\u2019t have lollies containing gelatin unless properly certified either. It sounds as though OP was aware of the restriction, so I\u2019m not sure why they couldn\u2019t figure out how to provide an option other than cut up fruit", "OP still an AH and a horrible host. You also don't sound any better. Fruit and veggies isn't a meal. Picking meat off isn't always an option because meat was on it.", "Actually, if this child has never eaten meat, she could have gotten quite sick by eating some.", "Um, you know people who don\u2019t eat meat still require protein and fats, right?", "Do me a favor, only eat fruits and veggies for a few months. Then eat a double cheese burger with bacon. Get back to me when you\u2019re shitting your guts out", "Research kosher in depth and maybe you\u2019ll get it. \nI don\u2019t have any religious or food restrictions, but I certainly respect others. And if a child\u2019s diet, for whatever reason (religion, ethics, plain pickiness) will preclude them from eating, you best believe I\u2019ll go above and beyond to feed that child. It\u2019s not that difficult to be kind.", "You must have lots of friends", "\ud83d\udc4d", "Everything OP has written is consistent with either a halal or kosher diet and she also wrote she does eat some types of meat.", "8yo was offered fruits and vegetables. That is a delicious and nutritious meal entirely appropriate for her diet. 8yo mom was mad that there wasn't MORE for her to eat, which at that point, is just being fussy.", "Fruits and vegetables are an excellent meal.", "1.) Yes it does work with 8-year-olds. They know how to carry a lunchbox.\n\n2.) It's extremely rude to make demands of your host. Good manners is accepting what a host puts on your plate graciously, whether you like it or not.\n\n3.) There were plenty of fruits and vegetables for the child to eat, plus, last I checked, cheesecake doesn't have meat in it, yet that was refused as well.", "Fruits and vegetables are an actual meal.", "Yeah. Prior knowledge makes all the difference here.", "Yeah, since it seems that OP was aware of the restriction beforehand, it is a definite YTA.\n\nHuge difference between being presented with dietary restriction on the spot and knowing about it beforehand. If OP was not going to accommodate, they should have made that clear to the parents long before the party.", "Highly unlikely.", "You do know that not every meal of every day has to be a perfectly calibrated dietary concoction, right?", "I've actually gone on no-meat spans. Literally no bowel problems. So, I'm calling BS on that one.", "I know what kosher is. It's religious nonsense. If you're over someone's house and you want to adhere to religious nonsense, you bring your own tools to do so. Don't impose your religion on others. \n\nBTW, kid had plenty to eat.", "Fruits and veggies isn't a meal. She wasn't being fussy. She has every right to be mad that a host was being awful and rude.", "No it isn't. Stop trying to justify rudeness on the host part.", "OP says it had gelatin which presumably why it was turned down.", "Yeah don't worry about considering that other people have different preferences than you do", "Lol it's not. But you're cute", "Okay, now you're just being disingenuous. \"Fruits and vegetables with dip\" is a party tray. Raw plants with a dip the child may or may not be able to eat. That is not a meal when all your friends are eating cooked entrees and sides and you know it.\n\nETA, not even \"vegetables,\" just carrots.", "What an uniformed sad person you are", "The meals you feed to children need to have adequate nutrients to keep them full.", "From your other comments, it\u2019s very clear you\u2019ll disagree with anything except starving a child. Congrats. You\u2019re a great person", "Yes it is.", "Which of the 3 points do you disagree with? If you disagree with 1, you're objectively wrong. If you disagree with 2, YTA. If you disagree with 3, you're not paying attention.", "When you don't wanna eat this that and the other thing, yes it is.", "I've had raw plants with no dip for lunch plenty of times. It's a good meal. There were also fruits. Don't forget those.", "Fruits and vegetables have adequate nutrients in them.", "Feeding a child healthy food is starving them? I never would have guessed.", "No it isn't.", "try harder", "No, they don\u2019t.", "She fed her a snack. Not a meal. At mealtime, when everyone else got a full meal. She couldn\u2019t even bother letting the other mom know she wasn\u2019t going to actually feed her, so other mom could bring an alternative", "You first.", "Yes they do.", "No, she fed her a meal. It just wasn't glamorous enough for the other mom."]}
