It can be hard to show there was effort in picking one unless the person is really into specific brands. I feel like there is more going on here, but hard to say if it's tween 'drama' or something else is making her feel like people don't try with gifts for her. Something for crocheting or baking may have been a more solid bet. \n\nRegardless, I think she was overly rude about it, but she may be finding it hard to regulate emotions if something else is going on.", "NTA. You did the best you could. She was just being a spoiled brat.", "NTA. She didn't give you anything to go on, and you bought her a nice gift, that you thought she would like. Plus, even if she didn't like it, a bath set is super easy to regift so she could have just said thank you and regifted it at a later date. \n\nShe's especially rude considering she didn't give you a gift! Even if she didn't have much money, a card or a homemade gift is relatively doable and at least shoes some effort on her part. \n\nYour sister sounds so spoiled and entitled", "NTA - Bur you should really tell her that your money is your money and that she is not entitled to bigger and expensive gifts when she isn\u2019t willing to give anything in return.
