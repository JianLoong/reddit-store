They thought of me, and I loved them for that. My grandparents and aunts' trinkets were always cat-related because they knew I liked cats. Dad actually tried for me, which meant as much as him searching every toy store in the city for a Cabbage Patch Kid with brown hair and blue eyes just like mine, a few years before. It's the effort, and the thought, that counts. Though Dad didn't have the option of leaving it to Mum because they divorced when I was very young, to the point that I don't even remember them being married. But he hadn't had to think about gifts for a teenage girl since, like, the Beatles were the band girls were screaming about, so I can definitely appreciate him trying, especially since we'd moved and I only saw him at holidays at that point."]}
