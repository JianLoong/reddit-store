I\u2019m the kind of person that needs information and shared experience to feel more comfortable knowing what to expect, but I struggled to find much information anywhere because miscarriages are so taboo. By the time I was confirmed to have miscarried, I had been panicking for 3 days texting my close friends (that didn\u2019t even know I was pregnant before hand, because \u201cprivacy\u201d) and telling them just so we can talk about their own first trimester bleeding and we can share pictures to see if I needed to mentally prepare myself. This is the only thing that kept me from going crazy in that time. I have since discovered subreddits that discuss this, but at the time all I had were the people around me and the trying to conceive subreddits. \n\nI was so distraught at the level of taboo while I was going through it, it became really important to me to share my experience with miscarriage on my social media to reach as many real people that I know. I also know that just based on statistics, PLENTY of women would likely be going through, went through, or about to go through my experience. \n\nI wanted to run my caption idea and post by my husband as it does pertain to him as well and he rejected the idea. He said it was inappropriate and he didn\u2019t want our personal life out there. I said I was willing to remove any mention of him and only speak to what I personally went through and he still said no because it\u2019s obvious who I miscarried with. I said I will share it anyways but remove him from everything like I mentioned because it\u2019s important for me and it feels like my contribution + last step for closure. He said I should turn the page without needing social media. \n\n\n\n\nPost:\nThe post is a quote that says something about preparing for child that never comes, followed by a 1 minute and 39 second video compiling 2-5 second clips of me seeing all my negative tests until I finally got my positive, telling our parents (only parents visible, he isn\u2019t visible), some of my favorite bump pictures alone that I would otherwise never get to share, and last is a picture of me in the ultrasound room smiling minutes before finding out there was no heart beat. \n\nThe caption I wrote reads:\n\n-A general timeline of when I was bleeding and when I was diagnosed\n-emotional things I didn\u2019t prepare for, like throwing away positive pregnancy tests at home\n-how much my support system meant to me\n-how common miscarriages are\n-finished with \u201cSo anyways, here are some of the memories I\u2019ll always cherish.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nTLDR: I think there aren\u2019t enough people sharing about miscarriages and I want to document to help the next person but my husband doesn\u2019t want me to share it for privacy reasons but I said the best I can do is removing any mention of him but still sharing it.

I think you need to remember that your social media has links to his family and friends too. While I understand wanting to share this and make it a less taboo topic, I fear if you post this and he isn't ready you will alienate him. I'd recommend you both doing some counseling. If posting is super important to you maybe do it only in support groups and subreddits until he is ready to share it with all of your combined family and friends. NAH, you are both just trying to heal in your own way.", "NAH. I can't say anyone's an asshole here. \n\nYou're not an asshole for wanting to share, and he's not an asshole for being uncomfortable with it.", "NAH\n\nyou both went through a huge loss. I get you wish to make it public but i believe if he doesnt then you should respect that. \n\nTheres private groups where you can post anon and get support, maybe thats a better option.\n\nYou posting this publicly will bring him unwanted attention regarding the loss. I dont believe this is fair.\n\n\ni get that you need closure but you dont get to get that by tearing the wound open for someone else", "Ouch. This one is tough, especially because I can see it from both sides.... The two of you went through a real trauma and are reacting differently. While I agree that this topic should be talked about more, spreading your experience on SNS against his wishes seems rather dismissive of him - could you perhaps find a different way, maybe more anonymous for him, to fulfill your need to share? And have you (plural) gotten therapy? I'm sorry this happened, OP. **NAH**", "Why not start a blog without disclosing your identity and reaching out to other women who may have similar stories to link up to it, and spread it on social media? If it is on your social media, it automatically identifies your SO as well, so you are essentially making the decision for him.", "NAH, you guys just unfortunately have different ways of venting your grief.\n\nI disagree with those saying \"he didn't have the miscarriage, you did\" because that carries the connotation that he didn't experience a loss. As a father of two who unfortunately never got to meet what would have been my third and oldest, I can tell you that I am devastated, and still dealing with it in therapy 8 years later. The LAST thing I would want is a well-wisher approaching me because they heard about one of the most traumatic events of my life on social media.\n\nThat said, it's not fair to you to not be able to share your experience and vent in a meaningful way. I think what you're trying to do is fantastic, and I think if these things were easier to talk about my marriage wouldn't have deteriorated the way it did. Neither of us processed it in a healthy way and it turned into self destructive habits on both of our part.\n\nIs there a potential compromise where you are able to post under a pseudonym where you can share your story in a way that doesn't involve an awkward situation for him? Regardless, I would also recommend a couples counselor if you don't have one already, as they can give you both the tools to support each other through the grief of your experience. I am so, so sorry for your loss, no parent should ever have to experience that pain, and I wish you the best of luck with everything \u2764\ufe0f", "NAH. OP i am so sorry to hear this and please don\u2019t lose hope. i feel for you both and in my opinion neither of you are in the wrong. people grieve in different ways and while you might want to share this with others and educate, your husband might be upset at having a reminder of this loss on the internet. there really is no right way to go about this, as you said miscarriage is quite taboo. if he is open to it, try having a calm conversation and maybe agree to possibly sharing this information later, once it is less painful.", "Can you give him some time to process and ask again? While you don\u2019t *need* his consent, you should want it. Explain why it\u2019s important.", "NAH you\u2019re both going through something very difficult and how you\u2019re coping with it is different. Possibly make a blog by anonymous to talk about it. You have every right to talk about it, just as he has every right to sweep it under the rug like it didn\u2019t happen. You both need to find a compromise somewhere in the middle good luck op!", "NAH- First off my sympathy for your loss.  I get discussing the issue with friends and family to help you get through it. I also get discussing it with others that experienced that same loss.  Yet, I'm like your husband.  I don't want my life posted on social media platforms for everyone/anyone can see it.   My personal life is for those who I want to share it with.", "First off, I\u2019m so deeply sorry for you and your husband\u2019s loss. No one\u2019s an AH here. This is a very difficult situation because it sounds like you and your husband process and cope with things in totally different ways. I highly disagree with everyone who says it\u2019s your body, you went through it, so it\u2019s your choice and your choice only. This is your *husband*. For any good relationship to thrive, there HAS to be trust. By posting something highly sensitive like this on your social media against his wishes, would put a huge strain on your relationship. Posting things on social isn\u2019t a one and done. People talk (good and bad), and there is follow up, questions, and will live on forever. You may be ready and willing to face these things, but it sounds like your husband simply isn\u2019t. Maybe he can get there, but I think it will take some very heartfelt conversations to understand where each other is coming from and then take evaluate where things stand.", "NAH\u2014 I\u2019ve also struggled with TTC and miscarriage. It\u2019s so common that the wife feels this loss intensely and real and the husband sees it as something potential that just didn\u2019t come to be. So I\u2019m kind of on your side that this is your story more than his, your body, etc. But I do think his request should be honoured here. \n\nTTC can be so incredibly not sexy. It can really put a strain. It\u2019s so sad when sex becomes a chore\u2014 you don\u2019t want to feel it\u2019s a chore for him, either. You don\u2019t want every auntie and cousin to ask him all the time how he\u2019s doing with that chore. A little privacy for a couple is a precious thing. \n\nAnd he knows his family and friends, too. Miscarriage is so common, it\u2019s very possible he feels badly presenting it publicly when he knows his sister has had countless, his friend\u2019s baby was stillborn, etc. Sometimes you need to read the room you\u2019re asking for sympathy from because they aren\u2019t the right people to ask it of. I felt terrible doing that\u2014 talking about how sad I am about my early miscarriage to get shut down because that person had multiple miscarriages, a stillbirth, a medically required abortion and a child with severe special needs. \n\nI second the idea of finding a more private community. Make a small support group on FB of your friends, or join private pregnancy loss groups on FB or here. There are people who do want to talk about it and support you, even though I\u2019m saying not everyone has it in them to.", "YTA\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. I have also been through a miscarriage and it is devastating. You need to rely on your support network to heal and move on. But social media is not the right place to do this if your husband isn't also on board.\n\nWhat has happened affects both you and your husband, and putting it in social media is making something that is deeply personal to him public, even if you don't outright name him.\n\nSome better approaches would include:\n\n- talking to your friends and family about it\n- writing out the post as a way to process things, but then keeping it private and not sharing it\n- writing it on social media anonymously so that no one knew who you were\n\nBut airing something publicly that is deeply personal to your husband is not ok.", "INFO. First thing, I'm so sorry for your loss Op! How has your husband been dealing with the loss? You said you were both devastated and you're looking for closure. I was just curious if you post about it on your public social media account will it trigger his grief since he will see it also?", "NAH\n\nBoth of you want to do this in different ways, and while what you want to do is important so if your partner's wish to work through this in peace.\n\nHe's right when he says even if you take any mention of him out of it, enough people will still know who the father was. Perhaps he doesn't want to have the inevitable condolences from mere acquaintances.\n\nIs there a way you can do this anonymously? No identifying pictures of any of you etc?", "YTA, as a pregnant person I would be beyond hurt and angry if dad decided to post anything on social media before I\u2019m ready. He\u2019s dad and without him we wouldn\u2019t be having this baby so I make sure to take his feelings into account regardless of if I\u2019m the one carrying said child. Did it ever occur to you that\u2019s he\u2019s grieving and mourning too? That he\u2019s not ready to put that out there? That he\u2019s hurting as well and deals with emotions differently than you? You can talk about the situation 1 year from now\u2026 heck 10 years from now\u2026 why is it so prevalent you do it immediately? I hate how society doesn\u2019t take dad into account simply because he\u2019s not the one carrying the baby, HE MATTERS. Imagine having a baby and you don\u2019t get any say as if that baby isn\u2019t equally yours, I would be livid. You could write in a journal for now to express yourself with fresh feelings and later post. I think it would be beneficial to write about how parents can deal with grief differently and it can cause disagreements and that it\u2019s completely normal. Do better!", "Info: why can't you just post aanonimously? It's an easy compromise - your names aren't slapped on it, satisfying his desire for privacy, and you get to support other women by sharing your experience, which is what you want.", "NTA, he didn't have the miscarriage, you did.  Your body went through it, his didn't.  Respect how he feels and make no mention of him or elude to him in whatever manner you post.", "It's YOUR social media account, you can share whatever you want. Don't let anyone control what you do or do not share on your own account. NTA", "YTA, no picturing him or mentioning him don\u2019t make it any less about him. He\u2019s asking you to respect his privacy and allow him to grieve in a way that makes him comfortable, and you\u2019re telling him his feelings don\u2019t matter. While you want to talk about it, he doesn\u2019t. People will still reach out to him and that\u2019s just going to make him feel worse. If you two can\u2019t come to a middle ground, nothing should be posted. There are other places for you to discuss your miscarriage.", "NTA. Your husband is grieving but he is also being an asshole. This was your body that went through this horrific experience and it just hits differently. Women should be allowed to be open about that. \n\nRight now it seems like your husband doesn't want someone to find out that you miscarried and blame him in some way but protecting himself is selfish when you are in mental turmoil and need community support.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I agree with you that more women should talk about things like this - miscarriage, postpartum depression, things that are taboo need to be out there so we don\u2019t feel like we are alone or insane when we experience them. But the miscarriage wasn\u2019t only yours, it was his too, and he wants to deal with grief differently than you do. I don\u2019t know the right answer for you two.

If you actually care about your husband you won\u2019t post it. DONT PUT STRANGERS ABOVE YOUR GRIEVING HUSBAND. Grieving is not an excuse to make your husband feel like shit.
