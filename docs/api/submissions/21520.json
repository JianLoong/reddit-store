Every year, my department offers summer internship spots to 5 high school students. They\u2019re considered prestigious and we get hundreds of applications a year. Each student gets assigned a mentor (I usually mentor 1 student). \n\nWhen the students are selected, they\u2019re put on a 3 week probationary period. If their work is good, their mentor will recommend them for the full internship. If their work is poor, their mentor can recommend to let them go and get a replacement intern. The final decision to keep or fire them is up to the selection committee, but they usually adhere to the recommendation. \n\nThis year, my coworker \u201cChris\u201d mentioned that his son \u201cGeorge\u201d was applying for an internship spot this year. He also said he was going to pull some strings to ensure he was accepted. I\u2019m not a fan of nepotism, but since I\u2019m not on the selection committee, there\u2019s nothing I can do. \n\nLo and behold, George was given one of the internship spots and I was assigned to be his mentor. I looked over his resume and it was alright, but it was nowhere near the level of students I\u2019ve mentored in the past. But I know resumes aren\u2019t everything, so I was willing to give him a chance. \n\nHowever, during George\u2019s internship, he did not perform up to standard. His reports were full of mistakes (which were never fixed), I would catch him on his phone when he was supposed to be working, and he\u2019d \u201cforget\u201d to do his tasks and turn them in very late. \n\nI tried to give him grace because he\u2019s a kid and I know he\u2019s learning, but even after I talked to him about improving several times and walked him through the tasks, his work and work ethic didn\u2019t get better. \n\nAfter the 3 weeks, I wrote up an honest report of George\u2019s work and said I would not recommend him for the full internship. But when Chris caught wind of this, he came up to me and asked me to reconsider. He said that George was trying hard to get better and kids make mistakes. I replied that I understand that, but George\u2019s unwillingness to learn from his mistakes bothered me. And it\u2019s not just about the mistakes, it\u2019s about his slacking off as well. \n\nChris got mad and said George is aiming to get into an Ivy League school and this was supposed to be the crowning achievement of his application. He said if he didn\u2019t complete this internship, he wouldn\u2019t get in and it would be my fault. He said since I\u2019m not a parent, I couldn\u2019t possibly understand the pressure to get your child into an Ivy League and it\u2019s okay to fudge the truth a bit to get a leg up. I replied that if George was truly motivated, his work would\u2019ve improved, and I\u2019m not going to lie on his behalf since it would fall on me to cover for his mistakes. \n\nI later recommended George to be let go and he was, and Chris has been cold to me ever since.

Chris is using his unethically using his leverage around the office to get his son a leg up on everyone else. If George was Ivy League caliber, Chris wouldn't need to primer everyone that his son was applying, or to reconsider your honest review of George's work.

Acceptance is the culmination of all things including grades, legacy (unfortunately), volunteer work, extra curriculars, and more.

Neither George nor Chris understands this. George is a direct reflection on Chris, and it's not a good one. You didn't \"destroy his self-confidence\", you adjusted it to reality. IF you had continued as Chris wanted and smoothed the way, AND George had actually made it into that Ivy League school, he would have been confronted with people who didn't have parents smoothing the way for them, and \"doing their homework\" so to speak.

Thank you for doing this.", "NTA\n\nThis is why they should just make a rule they cannot hire family of employees. It's silly. The kid couldn't even stay off his phone.", "That\u2019s my opinion as well. I have a replacement intern now and she\u2019s an absolute delight and such a good worker. She\u2019s also aiming for a top college, but she deserves to be there much more than George if her work ethic is anything to go by.", "If (big if unless nepotism/legacy is involved) George gets into an Ivy, he's going to wash out of he can't handle the workload of a high school internship.", "Guessing George figured the internship would be a sure thing since Daddy was pulling the strings. He fucked around and found out. Also, if this is how he behaved when he was trying to impress you, imagine how bad he'd have slacked off once he was past probation. NTA.", "on a side note, god if Rory Gilmore wasn't absolutely fucking insufferable past season 4", "If George were to slide into an Ivy League school , his lack of motivation or willingness to apply himself would have him fail in school inevitably. Not a good outcome either. His parents can\u2019t protect him anymore at that point.", "His father will most likely get him into Ivy like he got him into this internship, by pulling strings.\n\nHe isn\u2019t disciplined or have enough drive to get through an internship. What makes him or his father think he can get through and ivy? On top of that Op already said his resume was meh\u2026.   If you want to get into an ivy your resume can\u2019t be meh, especially if you\u2019re a jr in HS \n\nBut thats life , mediocre people with connections get positions they do not deserve, and swear they earned it and work hard \n\nNTA", "This.\n\nRule #1 when you get handed a gift wrapped job is to buckle down and take it seriously. By doing so you prove to the boss that you deserve it. Granted, George clearly didn\u2019t but if he was smart he could have made it look like he did.", "Agreed. Also, I mentioned this in another comment, Chris should have been more concerned about how George came across to people than letting them know George was his son. If he\u2019d done that then he wouldn\u2019t even need to advertise it as the boy\u2019s work would speak for itself.", "More than likely, he thought that he could coast by on \u201cdaddy\u201d\u2019s good name.", "I remember that episode!\n\n\u201cSmoke me a kipper, I\u2019ll be back for breakfast.\u201d", "He's taking his job too seriously?", "She also seems vindictive and jealous. For all we know, she was hyper critical of the kid. Everyone has seen a manager and/or mentor who just looks for a reason for fail someone because they don't like the person. Especially failing after three weeks with a HS kid is kind of ridiculous. \n\nThe other thing is, considering she already objected to the kid being selected from the start, an honorable person would have refused to be the mentor because they know they couldn't be fair.\n\nIMO, this is the kind of situation where you need a third party who was there and not involved to get an accurate judgement.", "I think the replacement is all the proof you need.\n\nThat Chris would insist you behave unethically speaks about him a lot more than you.  One of the rare time a ethics hotline might have been interesting to use.", "As a parent of a kid about this age. NTA. Better they learn now. Thank gawd nepo only got him a test phase.", "If George's resume was so lackluster for an internship he sure as hell wasn't getting into an Ivy anyway", "Sounds like the best outcome for all!", "One of our summer interns at my job is the daughter of one of our other engineers. She had a great resume but definitely got a little bit of a bump because we work with her dad. She\u2019s been an absolute delight! She\u2019s motivated and hardworking. I\u2019d say she\u2019s definitely in the top of the intern class. However, I\u2019m not surprised that she\u2019s pleasant and a great worker because her dad is also wonderful. \n\nThe fact his dad is kicking up a tantrum even though George had bad performance and a bad attitude shows that the shit apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the shit tree.", "Yes.", "Chris is projecting hard because he knows his little nepo boy wouldn't have gotten the spot otherwise."]}
