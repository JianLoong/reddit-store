Every year, my department offers summer internship spots to 5 high school students. They\u2019re considered prestigious and we get hundreds of applications a year. Each student gets assigned a mentor (I usually mentor 1 student). \n\nWhen the students are selected, they\u2019re put on a 3 week probationary period. If their work is good, their mentor will recommend them for the full internship. If their work is poor, their mentor can recommend to let them go and get a replacement intern. The final decision to keep or fire them is up to the selection committee, but they usually adhere to the recommendation. \n\nThis year, my coworker \u201cChris\u201d mentioned that his son \u201cGeorge\u201d was applying for an internship spot this year. He also said he was going to pull some strings to ensure he was accepted. I\u2019m not a fan of nepotism, but since I\u2019m not on the selection committee, there\u2019s nothing I can do. \n\nLo and behold, George was given one of the internship spots and I was assigned to be his mentor. I looked over his resume and it was alright, but it was nowhere near the level of students I\u2019ve mentored in the past. But I know resumes aren\u2019t everything, so I was willing to give him a chance. \n\nHowever, during George\u2019s internship, he did not perform up to standard. His reports were full of mistakes (which were never fixed), I would catch him on his phone when he was supposed to be working, and he\u2019d \u201cforget\u201d to do his tasks and turn them in very late. \n\nI tried to give him grace because he\u2019s a kid and I know he\u2019s learning, but even after I talked to him about improving several times and walked him through the tasks, his work and work ethic didn\u2019t get better. \n\nAfter the 3 weeks, I wrote up an honest report of George\u2019s work and said I would not recommend him for the full internship. But when Chris caught wind of this, he came up to me and asked me to reconsider. He said that George was trying hard to get better and kids make mistakes. I replied that I understand that, but George\u2019s unwillingness to learn from his mistakes bothered me. And it\u2019s not just about the mistakes, it\u2019s about his slacking off as well. \n\nChris got mad and said George is aiming to get into an Ivy League school and this was supposed to be the crowning achievement of his application. He said if he didn\u2019t complete this internship, he wouldn\u2019t get in and it would be my fault. He said since I\u2019m not a parent, I couldn\u2019t possibly understand the pressure to get your child into an Ivy League and it\u2019s okay to fudge the truth a bit to get a leg up. I replied that if George was truly motivated, his work would\u2019ve improved, and I\u2019m not going to lie on his behalf since it would fall on me to cover for his mistakes. \n\nI later recommended George to be let go and he was, and Chris has been cold to me ever since.

Chris is using his unethically using his leverage around the office to get his son a leg up on everyone else. If George was Ivy League caliber, Chris wouldn't need to primer everyone that his son was applying, or to reconsider your honest review of George's work.

Acceptance is the culmination of all things including grades, legacy (unfortunately), volunteer work, extra curriculars, and more.

Neither George nor Chris understands this. George is a direct reflection on Chris, and it's not a good one. You didn't \"destroy his self-confidence\", you adjusted it to reality. IF you had continued as Chris wanted and smoothed the way, AND George had actually made it into that Ivy League school, he would have been confronted with people who didn't have parents smoothing the way for them, and \"doing their homework\" so to speak.

Fuck the Georges and Chris types.", "\"Chris got mad and said George is aiming to get into an Ivy League school and this was supposed to be the crowning achievement of his application. He said if he didn\u2019t complete this internship, he wouldn\u2019t get in and it would be my fault. He said since I\u2019m not a parent, I couldn\u2019t possibly understand the pressure to get your child into an Ivy League and it\u2019s okay to fudge the truth a bit to get a leg up.\"\n\nGag gag gag gag gag.\n\nNTA, but Chris sure is.", "NTA thank you for being a decent person. So much of what is wrong in the world can be attributed to this kid\u2019s parents and their attitude. They need to let their child rise or fall on his own merit.", "No judgement but once you questioned process you should have passed on being his mentor. People who have power tend to make their perceptions come true in situations like this. I\u2019ve seen it from Vet quotas to nepotism. Instead of watching another apprentice go down, I took a \u201cpending failure with not enough tangible skills and poor work ethic\u201d in our department instead and sure enough he did better than fine. My co-worker swears he was objective but somewhere there is a young man that\u2019s probably certain he can\u2019t do anything right bc said co worker was anger he was only there bc he worked with a department heads daughter once. I completely regret not speaking up for that one. But I made sure the big cheese knew there was a problem after the department switch proved my instincts right. You can actually make real changes like pushing to set a certain criteria applicants need instead. And this is coming from someone who grew up in the projects and worked several jobs in the food industry since they were  15  only to finally have a career at 32.", "NTA, he wasn't taking it seriously because daddy probably assured him he'd get it no matter what. If he had taken your advice and improved that would be something different, but someone like this probably wouldn't have made it much further even if you \"passed\" him.", "Destroyed his unearned self confidence?  NTA", "From an early age, my sister and I were taught by our father to be grateful for the opportunities we were given. Things like merit-based extra-curricular activities and programs in particular were something he told us to take pride in, and he expected us to hold ourselves to a high standard and work hard, because our taking advantage of that opportunity meant someone else missed out.\n\nThis is apparently not a lesson Chris taught his son, which is particularly outrageous in this case because he pulled strings to get him this opportunity at the expense of other, more deserving candidates. His attempt to pressure you into overlooking his son's poor performance and work ethic is a band-aid solution at best, because George's lecturers and classmates will not be swayed by daddy dearest trying to convince them to \"reconsider\" their opinions on his demonstrated lack of engagement when it inevitably becomes an issue in his studies.\n\nNTA, OP. It's got nothing to do with you whether George is able to get in to the Ivy League university he wants, and not getting accepted is hardly the end of the world in any case. You shouldn't have to cover for a student who won't take advantage of the opportunities he is given, and kids like your replacement intern shouldn't be put at a disadvantage by a lazy nepo-baby. Here's hoping George and Chris both grow up.", "The only one who \u201cruined\u201d anything for George is Chris. By pandering to him and letting him get away with everything he taught him that he didn\u2019t need to try to succeed. The dad has no one to blame but himself. Op is def NTA.", "His life is far from ruined he just has to recover from a bad case of affluenza!", "To add to this, George will probably be fine.   \n\n\nHe will go to a good college on daddys money, and then get into a high paying job he doesnt deserve because of his dad, and then get shuffled around middle management as everybody tries to work around him, till he dad befriends the right person and he winds up getting a title and a lot of money to do nothing of importance", "He won't learn he will always remember that everything was taken from him and when he is at the window at McDonald's taking your order, you better check it cause you know he won't have done it right just out of spite.", "> this world, he\u2019ll probably complain that everybody discriminated against entitled men and he should have been given more chances, more slack\n\nWhat exactly wat the point of this? Entitled people are entitled no matter what gender. This part seems very unnecessary.", "Amen! To add this is the response he needed.  He needed a wake up call to reality and realize the working world is way different then high school and he has to work hard.  Hopefully this will light a fire under his butt.", "I bet George thought his dad would just manage that for him and he could coast by until the end.", "We actually don\u2019t know who got the spot after George. Could very well be another nepo baby. BUT! as OP mentioned in their edit, a hard working delightful person who deserved the spot much more. So we could have another nepo baby but at least one that earned it more. By the sound of it, an internship where OP works is not given to the masses.", "I don\u2019t think cold shouldering someone is a HR reportable offence. You are under no obligation to interact with people you dislike - even token pleasantries - as long as it doesn\u2019t interfere with the course of your work.", "Sadly, that's not how it works.", "As a first gen college grad that was \u201cconditionally\u201d accepted to my college, thank you. There are kids out there who don\u2019t have an inside track, who don\u2019t have money, who spend their teens years working three jobs while going to school\u2026those kids deserve a chance too. And while his replacement might not be a kid like that, it will still be a kid deserving of the opportunity. It\u2019s time for nepo kids to live in the real world like the rest of us.", "NTA! I was put in charge of picking a candidate for a prestigious internship that would pay for up to 5 years of their college tuition. My coworker was urging me to pick his son from the candidate pool.  I told him a hard no, that I was not going to be put in the middle of a conflict of interest situation. It would have been a nepotism nightmare if he didn't pan out like your co-workers son. You did the right thing.", "Good for you for being an exemplary example of a good and fair mentor. The replacement intern sounds like a better person for the position.", "Yay! I wish her all the luck in the world. :)", "Just a thought - do interns get paid a living wage?", "To be fair, talk with Chris and George together, going to graduate school at an Ivy is much more prestigious, they don't even take all their graduates. They them from other schools as well.\n\nYou just made the first four years less pressure so he won't crack like he just did.", "Wonderful!", "You should report Chris' request and behavior to the selection committee. If he worked for me, I'd want to know about this unprofessional bullshit and may go as far as firing Chris. I'm okay with giving someone a chance as a favor but to sabotage the process so thoroughly speaks very poorly to Chris' ethics.", "This response makes everything worthwhile. George didn't earn his spot and clearly did nothing to demonstrate skill or work ethic. I hope that he learns his lesson and that your new intern gets everything she's working for. (And as a teacher I thank you for holding George accountable for his actions. This is something that is lacking in so many school situations. It truly makes me fear for the future.)", "I don't understand parents who put their kids in a position to struggle and fail by pulling strings instead of helping them understand what they need to succeed and letting them fail early enough to learn. Ivy league schools are hard and expensive if you don't finish.", "Honestly if this is how he's acting during a supposedly important internship I'd hate to see his school behavior and grades ( I bet they're all just barely passing or failing) and there's zero chance of him going to college period let alone a top one.", "Definitely doesn't bode well but the average graduation rate for Ivy League schools is surprisingly high at 96.1%", "I wish I had your optimism", "Could be George wants to be a house framer or chef, that he's just doing what Chris is telling him to do.", "The same way George W. Bush failed inevitably?  Depending on the status of the legacy student's family, the Ivy will decide what \"success\" is.", "I think the Dad is the one who actually destroying the kid \u2026 spoon feeding the kid with opportunities but not growing the kid with responsibilities.", "If his George really needed this internship to get into an Ivy League, then it sounds like his father doesn't have the kind of power/influence to pull strings at those schools.", "Yup. Wish you were wrong", "I'm assuming George is a man, therefore he would be the \"entitled\" man in his scenario. ??? It's not that deep. This question seems very unnecessary.", ">She also seems vindictive and jealous. \n\n\nI always wonder when people like you drop statements like this... What do you hope to accomplish? \n\nOp is jealous... Of what? George taking her job? George getting into an IVY League school? \n\nAnd jobs like this will have a review process because the father would have kicked up enough dust for a review.", "Jealous of someone who consistently turned in work late that was riddled with mistakes?", "Chris is probably responsible for ruining his son in the first place. His son's behaviour 100% reflects how he's been parented - I'm sure Chris constantly makes excuses for his son, shields him from any mistakes or missteps that he makes, and doesn't hold him responsible for his own actions. There's a reason why kids like that turn out to be self-centered, self-involved adults that think the world should bend to their whims. It's better that George learns now, in high school that to the rest of the world, unlike his parents, he isn't \"special\" and he'll be treated just like everyone else. Nobody's gonna cut him slack just because he's Chris' son.", "Plus those schools don't take all their own grads for their masters programs. So there's another way in.", "Honestly, if George is really devastated, **and if he's smart enough to learn from the experience**, he could turn this whole thing around.\n\nHe could write a hell of a college application letter that focuses on all the life lessons he learned because he got fired from a prestigious internship.\n\n  \n\\- Daddy's influence can get you in the door, but it can't keep you inside.  \n\\- Turns out you can't coast on potential alone.  \n\\- When you're given pointers on how to improve, take them on board quickly --- before it's too late.", "Right?! Even if he\u2019s a legacy, you still have to be the top of your game. His father is delusional.", "Depends on the internship. Some internships are unpaid.

The federal government has paid internships.", "From the description, he doesn't appear to have \"cracked.\"  He appears to have believed he had an inside-track and didn't need to put in the work to keep the internship.

Instead, after being handed a highly-coveted internship position on a plate, he chose to be a punk and goofed around. His \"confidence\" I assume is more his dad and his ability to cover him no matter how badly he screws up. Ivy league? My gosh this is a disaster waiting to happen. I worked at a university and you wouldnt believe how many students drop out because their lawnmower parents can't clear every obstacle for them now and they just cant handle", "I've got a feeling George is going to go with Daddy and say that it's all OPs fault.

Same with C to B.  Essentially, no one gets less than a B. Harvard, Yale. Columbia, Dartmouth, etc.. It even made a segment on John Stossel's give me a break on 20/20.  (They interviewed students at either Harvard or yale who claimed grade inflation was a myth, that they earned the As because\"they were smarter than any  students who came before them.\") And they believed it.  Lol. \n\nIvys also don't let people fail.  They will throw all kinds of resources at the student to keep them in school so their reported transfer rate is practically zero.  \n\nOP, you did the right thing. I worked at a major telecom and 90% of the interns were children of executives. Some were great,  others not so much. Not one thought they were there because of nepotism.... they actually thought they earned the spot.  It was baffling.  \n\nThere were more deserving students out there that would never get a chance because of nepotism.
