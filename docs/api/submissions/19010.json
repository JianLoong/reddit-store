The 2nd one \u201cMichael\u201d 16M, and \u201cMary\u201d 19F. Ali is very high functioning. She does her job well. She interacts well with people, works well with the team, and customers have nothing negative to say about her. Michael is low-functioning. He doesn\u2019t work in the main service area dealing with customers. He just cleans. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with that. He does what he\u2019s capable of. He\u2019s not social  but he does a job not many of us like to do and we appreciate him for it. Then there is Mary. Mary doesn\u2019t do her job well. She is capable of it though. I have seen her do it better than most. The issue is that she has gotten lazier.   \nMary is noticeably autistic. I have no issues with this in of itself. However, Mary uses this fact to exclude herself from any punishments. Customers complain about Mary being moody with them. This is very much true. Mary has random mood swings all the time. Whenever she\u2019s asked by another coworker to do something it tends to trigger it A few days ago a customer complained that Mary yelled at him over a simple ordering mistake. A manager tried to write Mary up but our General Manager told them not to as Mary claimed she had a sensory overload.   \nThat is not the first time something like that has happened. I will admit I don\u2019t know what could trigger a sensory overload but that day was a very chill day. Not many customers and it was relatively calm inside.   \nToday there was only one manager on site. I have a higher position than Mary (not a manager but higher up than her and the rest of the crew.) So the manager left me in charge of running things while he went on his lunch break. I asked Mary to put some gloves on and take out all the full trash bags from the bins and replace them with new ones. She replies in an angry tone: \u201cyou do it. I won\u2019t do that, it's a dirty job.\u201d I politely replied that I was left in charge and that I was giving an order not asking. At this point Mary yells out that she won\u2019t do it.  \nThe manager hears the yelling check on us.I tell him what Mary did. Mary again uses \u201cI\u2019m autistic I\u2019m just overstimulated\u201d excuse she uses a lot. The manager literally walks away and tells me to make someone else do it.   \nThis was a breaking point. I called our area supervisor later and tell her what happened. She comes to the store and asks all the employees if what I'm saying is true. They all back me up. Mary starts crying. I tell our supervisor this happens quite often with Mary. My coworkers back me up again. Mary gets a 3 week suspension. Her parents come pick her up from work. They stare at me with furious eyes.

However, I do think that your workplace has insufficiently trained you and the other coworkers on how best to work with Mary. It sounds like she has particular triggers that some of the management understand how to deal with to get her to be productive. Asking someone without sufficient training to deal with her is unfair. Your frustration is not surprising nor is Mary's. Your employer should provide appropriate training on how best to interact with Mary, and how to supervisor her when asked. This will alleviate future potential conflicts of the kind you describe.", "YTA but by a small margin. \nYou've kind of self-reported that your knowledge on autism is outdated (high-functioning/low-functioning is no longer a fashionable way to describe nuerodivergent people as it dismisses people who have a very complex and diverse brain chemistry as existing in a binary). And acknowledge you don't care to know what sensory overload is and are policing it despite your lack of knowledge.\nThe subtext is you've lead a bandwagon against someone you don't like dealing with when you could've taken on the advice of your immediate superior and it would be dealt with. Why be so bothered about things out of your control and escalate higher when that's not your job?", "ESH. It\u2019s not for you to decide when she has a legitimate reason to have a sensory overload or not. You cannot hide your disdain for her here so I doubt you\u2019re doing it in the workplace.\n\nI get that her performance impacts you. That is management\u2019s fault and not hers. There should be reasonable accommodations for her and procedures in place for her to follow them. Expectations should be clear. Maybe she\u2019s just a brat! But maybe not and she doesn\u2019t have a handle on tone/ other cues to articulate what she means to or can\u2019t do it when overwhelmed. Management should not give her work she cannot do and should not be putting other employees in charge of her. This situation is their fault.", "OP, perhaps both you and Mary are in the wrong here. I have read your comment about this kind of behavior from Mary being recent and that she did all her work with no issues previously. But let me ask you this, did you ever think that maybe as time went on the stress that comes with the work got to her a lot more than someone like you who is neurotypical? If Mary is getting lazier and just using her disability as an excuse then you have every reason to be angry. To all this saying it\u2019s not OP\u2019s role to get angry think about the fact that as a team at a workplace, the way one team member acts affects all. You mentioned that one of your other coworkers who is autistic doesn\u2019t do a lot of the stressful work and takes care of cleaning. Perhaps Mary is better suited to something like that. Anyway. My vote is no assholes here. This just seems like a big misunderstanding from all parties.", "[removed]", "ESH\n\nUsing a disability as a cover to not do your job properly is not great thing to do.

If she were actually overstimulated, She would have given you the same reason, However she tells you it is a dirty job and when the manager checks, She mentions overstimulation.

Here is why. I was working at this place for about 3 months before Mary began working there. She started off horrible at the job as everyone does. However, she learned so quickly it surpassed all expectations. She told everyone she has asd and we are all cool with it. It's only since about 9 months ago she starts claiming autism as an excuse or sensor overloads. Before then she did all work asked of her no issues.", "Perhaps my way of viewing such disorders is outdated. But let me ask this: If someone who is autistic is easily triggered by working in a high stress enviroment like a fast food job than why work there at all? I understand that for some it may be their only choice however, when you refuse to do your work and blame your disability for it when others who have the same disability as you do their job just as well as a neurotypical person then I have a right to question your ethics.", "THIS. \n\nThe way you describe the autistic people here shows that you have a long way to go to being a particularly good judge of what is autism and what isn\u2019t.

OP did not make any decisions about what standard she met.", "Overloaded or not, she can't be allowed to scream at customers. Sometimes we have to be realistic about our limitations.

You cant compare these three people based on such a broad diagnosis as autism", "You're not qualified to question that nor are you paid to.", "So part of why it's important to point out your understanding of autism is outdated is because autism presents in a myriad of ways; certain skills or processing styles are present to differing degrees in some autistic people compared to others.\n\nWhat that means is that for two autistic people, what they can do, what's triggering or difficult, can vary considerably. So each of the three coworkers being able to manage different kinds of works with different levels of efficacy isn't an indicator one person is lying so much as they're different people with different accessibility needs... And this is without really touching on a person being autistic doesn't mean that that's the only way they're neurodivergent and in fact comorbidities are super common\n\nI think where YTA is that you're not really reporting this person bc of a failure to do her job; manager on site cleared her to not do that work so it's not part of her job even if you think it should be. You reported her because you think she's lazy and judged her ethics; but accessibility concerns are between the employee and HR &/or their manager...

I just said that if you refuse to do your work which is required of you because of some disability while others with that disability do it well than that is pretty questionable. If you read another one of my responses then you will see that in the past Mary did all her work without issues or claiming a disability.

Everyone is the hero of their own story, nothing wrong with that. It's just here it manifests a bit less humbly as people seek a sounding board as to why some people don't buy into their virtuosity.\n\nThrough that lens there's holes in OP's justifications, particularly composition bias of \"over-stimulation looked like this so therefore my judgment is that all overloads are that.\" and slippery slope, \"first it's these small things but now she's abusing the excuse\".\nGiven OP isn't the hero of the world, we should consider how things look from the other party's perspective.", "What part?", "As someone who is autistic, and works with other neurodivergent people in an animal hospital, yeah thats not acceptable.
