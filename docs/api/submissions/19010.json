He\u2019s not social  but he does a job not many of us like to do and we appreciate him for it. Then there is Mary. Mary doesn\u2019t do her job well. She is capable of it though. I have seen her do it better than most. The issue is that she has gotten lazier.   \nMary is noticeably autistic. I have no issues with this in of itself. However, Mary uses this fact to exclude herself from any punishments. Customers complain about Mary being moody with them. This is very much true. Mary has random mood swings all the time.

Not many customers and it was relatively calm inside.   \nToday there was only one manager on site. I have a higher position than Mary (not a manager but higher up than her and the rest of the crew.) So the manager left me in charge of running things while he went on his lunch break. I asked Mary to put some gloves on and take out all the full trash bags from the bins and replace them with new ones. She replies in an angry tone: \u201cyou do it. I won\u2019t do that, it's a dirty job.\u201d I politely replied that I was left in charge and that I was giving an order not asking. At this point Mary yells out that she won\u2019t do it.  \nThe manager hears the yelling check on us.I tell him what Mary did. Mary again uses \u201cI\u2019m autistic I\u2019m just overstimulated\u201d excuse she uses a lot. The manager literally walks away and tells me to make someone else do it.   \nThis was a breaking point. I called our area supervisor later and tell her what happened. She comes to the store and asks all the employees if what I'm saying is true. They all back me up. Mary starts crying. I tell our supervisor this happens quite often with Mary.

It sounds like she has particular triggers that some of the management understand how to deal with to get her to be productive. Asking someone without sufficient training to deal with her is unfair. Your frustration is not surprising nor is Mary's. Your employer should provide appropriate training on how best to interact with Mary, and how to supervisor her when asked. This will alleviate future potential conflicts of the kind you describe.", "YTA but by a small margin. \nYou've kind of self-reported that your knowledge on autism is outdated (high-functioning/low-functioning is no longer a fashionable way to describe nuerodivergent people as it dismisses people who have a very complex and diverse brain chemistry as existing in a binary). And acknowledge you don't care to know what sensory overload is and are policing it despite your lack of knowledge.\nThe subtext is you've lead a bandwagon against someone you don't like dealing with when you could've taken on the advice of your immediate superior and it would be dealt with. Why be so bothered about things out of your control and escalate higher when that's not your job?", "ESH. It\u2019s not for you to decide when she has a legitimate reason to have a sensory overload or not. You cannot hide your disdain for her here so I doubt you\u2019re doing it in the workplace.\n\nI get that her performance impacts you. That is management\u2019s fault and not hers. There should be reasonable accommodations for her and procedures in place for her to follow them. Expectations should be clear. Maybe she\u2019s just a brat!

Management should not give her work she cannot do and should not be putting other employees in charge of her. This situation is their fault.", "OP, perhaps both you and Mary are in the wrong here. I have read your comment about this kind of behavior from Mary being recent and that she did all her work with no issues previously. But let me ask you this, did you ever think that maybe as time went on the stress that comes with the work got to her a lot more than someone like you who is neurotypical? If Mary is getting lazier and just using her disability as an excuse then you have every reason to be angry. To all this saying it\u2019s not OP\u2019s role to get angry think about the fact that as a team at a workplace, the way one team member acts affects all. You mentioned that one of your other coworkers who is autistic doesn\u2019t do a lot of the stressful work and takes care of cleaning. Perhaps Mary is better suited to something like that. Anyway.

So each of the three coworkers being able to manage different kinds of works with different levels of efficacy isn't an indicator one person is lying so much as they're different people with different accessibility needs... And this is without really touching on a person being autistic doesn't mean that that's the only way they're neurodivergent and in fact comorbidities are super common\n\nI think where YTA is that you're not really reporting this person bc of a failure to do her job; manager on site cleared her to not do that work so it's not part of her job even if you think it should be. You reported her because you think she's lazy and judged her ethics; but accessibility concerns are between the employee and HR &/or their manager...

However he's otherwise into a bunch of normal things (Computer games, he likes music and learns guitar etc) and is of average intelligence. But he does, and he's admitted it to his mum, play on his autism when it suits him and means he doesn't necessarily have to do something he doesn't want too/go somewhere he doesn't want too etc. He doesn't do it all the time, but he's said he knows what to do to get his way or avoid sometihng if he decides too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut, on the spectrum, I think he's pretty high functioning.

As an individual with ASD as well, this just seems more her using sensory issues as an excuse for doing a task she simply does not want to do but is fully capable of doing.

She learned the job quickly and can do it well but over time, was unable to maintain that standard. Why? Probably because she was overloaded and was becoming burned out.\n\nThis is the issue autistic people and employment. They start a job and to make a good impression they show that they can pick it up easily and perform very well because in the beginning they can compensate and spend extra energy masking the areas they need support in. But this is energy beyond what they actually have to give and so it's not sustainable and they start to burn out. This is why it's considered a disability.\n\nThen when they ask for adjustments they're dismissed because to neurotypical people, \"they can do the job perfectly well, they're just being 'lazy'\" But they're not being lazy. They've overspent their energy and need support that they actually should have had from the beginning. It's unfair to expect autistic people to burn themselves out doing a job because management are too lazy to provide the adjustments they're entitled to.\n\nLike I said, it sounds like perhaps no level of adjustments would be enough to allow Mary to sustain herself in this particular job.
