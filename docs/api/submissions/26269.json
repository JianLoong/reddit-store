{"id": 26269, "submission_id": "16avjff", "title": "AITA for not wanting my autistic cousin at my child-free wedding?", "selftext": "Throwaway because I have family that use Reddit as well. Next spring, I am getting married to the love of my life. We have decided that we don\u2019t want children at our wedding. Not many of our friends and family have young children, and the ones that do are fine with getting a sitter for the weekend since we gave them a lot of notice. The only ones to put up a fight are my aunt and uncle who have a daughter with autism. She is 20, but will be 21 by the time my wedding day comes around. She is what they call \u201chigh-functioning\u201d, which means she can talk and wash/dress herself, and she has some friends. She graduated from high school a couple years ago and is currently living with her parents (my aunt and uncle) while working at a grocery store. Despite her being technically an adult I just don\u2019t see her as such. Every time I talk to her at a family gathering it\u2019s like talking to a child. She is obsessed with toy ponies and barbie dolls, and brings them up at every opportunity. She draws in her notebook constantly and never makes eye contact when talking to me. She does not have loud meltdowns like other special needs kids I\u2019ve met before, but I really don\u2019t want to risk her ruining my special day. I told my aunt and uncle that I didn\u2019t want her there and they became very upset. They said she already saw the invite and knew it was child-free but because she is an \u201cadult\u201d, she thought she was still included. My aunt tried to guilt me by saying she\u2019d already picked out a dress and a gift but I didn\u2019t want to hear it. My fianc\u00e9 says I\u2019m being an asshole and we should let her attend because she has attended other weddings before with no issue. Everyone is making me feel horrible for not treating her like an adult when she doesn\u2019t act like one.

She is a functioning adult. Wow.", "YTA. If she's not prone to meltdowns, I fail to see how she'd put your special day at risk.

Like.... my god lololol the infantilization and ableism is indeed present here.", "YTA\n\nYou have posted NO RATIONALE for not wanting her except that she has autism which makes you the AH.  The idea of no child wedding is for behavior issues, and at times to reduce the number of guests.  Your own post shows she has no issue with behavior and no mention that you are looking to save money.  You try to make yourself look like the non AH by saying she does not act like an adult, but your only evidence is she likes drawing in her notebook, and she doesn't make eye contact with you.  The only risk in ruing your special day would be the guests finding out how cold you are and how unloving of a family member with a disability.   You definitely are coming across as a bride/groom zilla.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to invite anyone you don\u2019t want to at the wedding, but your reasoning and response is really something else.

She doesn\u2019t make scenes, so what\u2019s the problem?\n\nAlso, putting \u2018adult\u2019 in quotation just shows further that you see people with different interests that fall under the autism umbrella as children. Just say you\u2019re ableist and be done with it.\n\n(Edited to replace the words high functioning with low support needing)", "YTA. Your cousin will quietly mind her business and talk to her family members. Its going to be hard having a childfree wedding with your behaviour, though.", ">Everyone is making me feel horrible for not treating her like an adult when she doesn\u2019t act like one.\n\nI guess you think your behaviour is mature... excluding someone because they like toy ponies and don't make eye contact is pretty damn immature. \n\nYTA. Maybe your invitation should have read *no kids or people with disabilities*.", "YTA. What exactly makes you think she would \"ruin your special day\"?  Simply the fact that she is autistic?!!", "YTA.\n\nYou said yourself in the post that she has been to other weddings with no issue. \n\nSounds like you're just being a real jerk to autistic adults who enjoy toys.\n\n\nIf they do end up coming, I kind of hope they take your gift back to the store.", "YTA holy shit. \n\n>she\u2019s obsessed with toy ponies and barbie dolls\n\nSo what?

Good lord, get over yourself and stop being a stuck up judgmental brat.", "YTA As someone who has a close friend with high--functioning autism (no quotation marks needed btw) I can say this is extremely cruel to your aunt, uncle, and niece. It doesn't matter if you don't see her as an \"adult\" she is one. I believe you have lost perspective as to what your niece is going through. Also if you know she doesn't have meltdowns and has been fine at weddings before than what is the issue?

I'm all for excluding children and disruptive folks from weddings, but she is not a child and there is nothing to indicate she will be disruptive.

You're too childish, and like childish things like being mean, petty, and vindictive so you're not adult enough to marry.\n\nYou can be as exclusionary as you want, but I would wear being excluded from your shitty presence like a badge of honor.", "YTA - if you didn\u2019t want her there then you should have had a conversation with your aunt and uncle BEFORE you sent out the wedding invitations. How were they supposed to know that you see her as a child so is excluded. I think you\u2019re making a very bad decision that could sour your relationship with many of your family members down the line.", "YTA. Your fianc\u00e9 already told you that you\u2019re being an AH & you don\u2019t seem particularly qualified to determine whether others are or are not adults. In your version of the story you sound ableist and childish.", "YTA. It seems like she will be perfectly fine since she\u2019s been at other weddings and they went well. Just because she likes kiddy things and toys doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a problem? I\u2019d understand if she was disruptive and loud, but she seems fine. \n\nNgl you just sound like a knob. Seems like you just want to chuck her out because she\u2019s autistic. I\u2019m kinda surprised your fianc\u00e9 still wants to marry you at this rate.", "YTA\n\nSo because she likes certain things, that doesn't make her an \"adult\"? I hate to break it to you but a lot of adults like kid things and you're judging her soley based on that. \n\nIt would be different if she had meltdowns and was overall not in the mood to be at a wedding but what you're saying is ridiculous.", "Yta. 100%  \n\nIt is your wedding.

Are you afraid she's going to steal attention from you?\n\n>Everyone is making me feel horrible for not treating her like an adult when she doesn\u2019t act like one.\n\nYou need to ask yourself the real reason why you don't want her there, and then evaluate whether that's legitimate.

You need to step back and realize you are being a little irrational in this situation. You would be justified for not wanting her to come to the wedding she was not capable of sitting quietly at a wedding, but she has already proven this. You are entitled to your own opinion, and I understand you want a perfect day, but that doesn't give you an excuse to be an AH to your family.", "YTA\n\nWhat ever her issues she is a legal adult, and if she has been ok at other family weddings then why shouldn't she be allowed to attend yours.\n\nThis borders on discrimination.", "YTA-I don't even need to justify this. You are so very clearly the villain in this scenario.", "YTA. She *is* an adult. Nothing about this even begins to suggest your \u2018special day\u2019 would be \u2018ruined\u2019 by her attendance.

I had CBT and I couldn\u2019t understand many years ago why I didn\u2019t have friends and my CBT therapist blamed me and told me I was the problem and shamed me for my neurodivergence. After two sessions she made me have such a severe panic attack I fell down three flights of stairs on the way out of her office. It happened again with another CBT therapist too minus the stairs. Normal counselling tried telling me what my problem was when I already knew my issues I just didn\u2019t know how to deal with them, for example I was upset at medical negligence during kidney failure but she told me my problem was that I was scared to die which wasn\u2019t true. Neurotypical therapists make people like us more often than not. You don\u2019t want to shame the child into masking (look up masking as a term if you don\u2019t know what it is) because masking will eventually lead to burn out and to them not developing a true sense of self but rather what everyone/ society wants them to be and this can be dangerous down the road. I was shamed so badly for over twenty years by mental health professionals for what I can\u2019t help and by everyone around me that I masked so hard that when I couldn\u2019t anymore I stopped speaking to anyone besides my mum and dad for two years because I didn\u2019t know who I was or how to act in society anymore. Everyone masks, don\u2019t get me wrong, for example you have a work mask, a mother mask, a mask for your friends - they\u2019re all slightly different versions of you and there\u2019s no shame in that but someone you don\u2019t want it so extreme that you don\u2019t know who you are underneath. You want to be able to sit with yourself at night and be comfortable within yourself and that\u2019s what you want for your about to be child. The key is to help your child be themselves in the healthiest ways possible. My advice is to seek out therapists that specialises in neurodivergence, maybe even a therapist who\u2019s autistic themselves. It also depends what issues there are, such as if there\u2019s a speech delay then a speech and language therapist will be required. If there\u2019s trauma then you\u2019re definitely going to need a neurodivergent trauma therapist. Don\u2019t follow Autism speaks charity they\u2019re awful and disgusting. As an autistic person myself, my mum always encouraged me to be self aware, what am I feeling? If I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m feeling (which is common) then that\u2019s okay, let\u2019s take some time and figure out that. Break everything down into smaller chunks than you would normally and maintain communication to make sure you understand your child and they understand you. Clear communication is of the upmost importance, I cannot stress that enough. If you feel you\u2019re not being heard by them, take five, then continue the conversation, not every confrontation has to be done in one go, don\u2019t overwhelm them but don\u2019t tread on eggshells. Don\u2019t be that person who raises that awful autistic person that has no boundaries and isn\u2019t disciplined in the correct way. Autism is a reason, not an excuse. Don\u2019t assume anything. Also sometimes people with autism don\u2019t have a clue about how our tone sounds, I can sound normal in my brain but I\u2019ve been a stroppy cow and I wonder why someone\u2019s upset. I could go on all day and I\u2019m sorry if I haven\u2019t been clear, it\u2019s late where I am. \n\nTLDR - keep a safe and extremely clear communicative environment, try not to judge and remember some therapies that are normally great for the average neurotypical person can be very harmful to autistic people.", "I remember seeing a video where someone was doing clicker training with their kid and giving her treats.
