{"id": 26269, "submission_id": "16avjff", "title": "AITA for not wanting my autistic cousin at my child-free wedding?", "selftext": "Throwaway because I have family that use Reddit as well. Next spring, I am getting married to the love of my life. We have decided that we don\u2019t want children at our wedding. Not many of our friends and family have young children, and the ones that do are fine with getting a sitter for the weekend since we gave them a lot of notice. The only ones to put up a fight are my aunt and uncle who have a daughter with autism. She is 20, but will be 21 by the time my wedding day comes around. She is what they call \u201chigh-functioning\u201d, which means she can talk and wash/dress herself, and she has some friends. She graduated from high school a couple years ago and is currently living with her parents (my aunt and uncle) while working at a grocery store. Despite her being technically an adult I just don\u2019t see her as such. Every time I talk to her at a family gathering it\u2019s like talking to a child. She is obsessed with toy ponies and barbie dolls, and brings them up at every opportunity. She draws in her notebook constantly and never makes eye contact when talking to me. She does not have loud meltdowns like other special needs kids I\u2019ve met before, but I really don\u2019t want to risk her ruining my special day. I told my aunt and uncle that I didn\u2019t want her there and they became very upset. They said she already saw the invite and knew it was child-free but because she is an \u201cadult\u201d, she thought she was still included. My aunt tried to guilt me by saying she\u2019d already picked out a dress and a gift but I didn\u2019t want to hear it. My fianc\u00e9 says I\u2019m being an asshole and we should let her attend because she has attended other weddings before with no issue. Everyone is making me feel horrible for not treating her like an adult when she doesn\u2019t act like one.

She is a functioning adult. Wow.", "YTA. If she's not prone to meltdowns, I fail to see how she'd put your special day at risk. Also, as a person with ASD, I find it absolutely hilarious that you describe \"high functioning\" as \"can talk, wash/dress herself, and has some friends\". Like.... my god lololol the infantilization and ableism is indeed present here.", "YTA\n\nYou have posted NO RATIONALE for not wanting her except that she has autism which makes you the AH.  The idea of no child wedding is for behavior issues, and at times to reduce the number of guests.  Your own post shows she has no issue with behavior and no mention that you are looking to save money.  You try to make yourself look like the non AH by saying she does not act like an adult, but your only evidence is she likes drawing in her notebook, and she doesn't make eye contact with you.  The only risk in ruing your special day would be the guests finding out how cold you are and how unloving of a family member with a disability.   You definitely are coming across as a bride/groom zilla.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to invite anyone you don\u2019t want to at the wedding, but your reasoning and response is really something else. People have child-free weddings so they can avoid outbursts, not because they don\u2019t want someone there with \u201cchildish\u201d interests.", "YTA .\n\nHigh functioning autistic here, and I gotta say, I would be crushed to find out my cousin held me and my interests in such contempt. She doesn\u2019t make scenes, so what\u2019s the problem?\n\nAlso, putting \u2018adult\u2019 in quotation just shows further that you see people with different interests that fall under the autism umbrella as children. Just say you\u2019re ableist and be done with it.", "YTA. Your cousin will quietly mind her business and talk to her family members. Its going to be hard having a childfree wedding with your behaviour, though.", ">Everyone is making me feel horrible for not treating her like an adult when she doesn\u2019t act like one.\n\nI guess you think your behaviour is mature... excluding someone because they like toy ponies and don't make eye contact is pretty damn immature. \n\nYTA. Maybe your invitation should have read *no kids or people with disabilities*.", "YTA. What exactly makes you think she would \"ruin your special day\"?  Simply the fact that she is autistic?!!", "YTA.\n\nYou said yourself in the post that she has been to other weddings with no issue. \n\nSounds like you're just being a real jerk to autistic adults who enjoy toys.\n\n\nIf they do end up coming, I kind of hope they take your gift back to the store.", "YTA holy shit. \n\n>she\u2019s obsessed with toy ponies and barbie dolls\n\nSo what? Let people like what they like. It\u2019s your wedding and you can invite (or uninvite who you want) but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not an AH for it", "yta\n\nyou said \u201cchildfree wedding\u201d which is perfectly acceptable btw, but then you take issue with one specific adult, a family member no less, because they arent good enough for you?\n\nYou are literally contradicting the whole purpose of a childfree event", "She is an adult.  She has no history of having meltdowns.  There is zero evidence that she'd do anything except be a happy guest.  YTA and a huge one.\n\nYou should be ashamed.

And yes, you are asshole.", "YTA- I seriously hope your fiance sees what kind of values you hold & runs for the hills! You'll probably have more issues with guests becoming drunk and belligerent than with a quiet girl who hasn't caused issues in the past. Please use this time to take a good look at yourself.", "YTA, she's not a child!! She doesn't have meltdowns, so basically, you're just being an AH for zero reasons. It's not like she's going to bring her notebook and ponies. I would get banned for telling you what I truly think of you.", "YTA. I can't even begin to unpack all the shit you said. Because of her interests she isn't a \"real\" adult? Well based on that reasoning... you're behaving like a child, maybe you should sit out your own wedding. Good lord, get over yourself and stop being a stuck up judgmental brat.", "YTA As someone who has a close friend with high--functioning autism (no quotation marks needed btw) I can say this is extremely cruel to your aunt, uncle, and niece. It doesn't matter if you don't see her as an \"adult\" she is one. I believe you have lost perspective as to what your niece is going through. Also if you know she doesn't have meltdowns and has been fine at weddings before than what is the issue? This sounds more like you have an issue with the aunt and uncle rather than the niece but are using her as a scapegoat (that's the only way I could even come close to justifying how insensitive you're being).", "YTA. I'm all for excluding children and disruptive folks from weddings, but she is not a child and there is nothing to indicate she will be disruptive. So what if she talks to her parents about ponies all night, or sits quietly drawing in a notebook? It sounds like you're embarrassed of people knowing she's a part of your family.", "YTA and a nasty piece of work to boot.  You're too childish, and like childish things like being mean, petty, and vindictive so you're not adult enough to marry.\n\nYou can be as exclusionary as you want, but I would wear being excluded from your shitty presence like a badge of honor.", "YTA - if you didn\u2019t want her there then you should have had a conversation with your aunt and uncle BEFORE you sent out the wedding invitations. How were they supposed to know that you see her as a child so is excluded. I think you\u2019re making a very bad decision that could sour your relationship with many of your family members down the line.", "YTA. Your fianc\u00e9 already told you that you\u2019re being an AH & you don\u2019t seem particularly qualified to determine whether others are or are not adults. In your version of the story you sound ableist and childish.", "YTA. It seems like she will be perfectly fine since she\u2019s been at other weddings and they went well. Just because she likes kiddy things and toys doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a problem? I\u2019d understand if she was disruptive and loud, but she seems fine. \n\nNgl you just sound like a knob. Seems like you just want to chuck her out because she\u2019s autistic. I\u2019m kinda surprised your fianc\u00e9 still wants to marry you at this rate.", "YTA\n\nSo because she likes certain things, that doesn't make her an \"adult\"? I hate to break it to you but a lot of adults like kid things and you're judging her soley based on that. \n\nIt would be different if she had meltdowns and was overall not in the mood to be at a wedding but what you're saying is ridiculous.", "Yta. 100%  \n\nIt is your wedding.  You are allowed to invite anyone you want.  \n\nBut don't expect your aunt and uncle to be there if their adult daughter isn't invited for a stupid reason.", "YTA\n\n>My fianc\u00e9 says I\u2019m being an asshole and we should let her attend because she has attended other weddings before with no issue. \n\nYou have proof she knows how to behave (i.e. not cause a scene) at weddings. You want to bar her because why? She enjoys talking about children's toys? Are you afraid she's going to steal attention from you?\n\n>Everyone is making me feel horrible for not treating her like an adult when she doesn\u2019t act like one.\n\nYou need to ask yourself the real reason why you don't want her there, and then evaluate whether that's legitimate. If you stick to your guns, don't expect your aunt and uncle to attend, either.", ">Everyone is making me feel horrible for not treating her like an adult when she doesn\u2019t act like one.  \n\n\nBy this standard, *you* should not be invited to the wedding either. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou're literally describing every person in the world that doesn't have the same interests as you.\n\nI have friends that do competitive cycling, play rugby, and watch Mexican football (soccer)......  all of which are things I don't give a shit about when they start talking about it.\n\nShe would be a guest that you don't share common interests with.  You're a major AH when you treat her this poorly.", "You\u2019re a HUGE asshole. Also, who the hell cares if she doesn\u2019t look you in the eye? Get over yourself.", "YTA.

That poor lady. \nGood luck with your special day \ud83e\udd28", "Because she has never caused any issues YTA. Just let her sit at a table and draw. Ask the venue if there is a nice quiet spot she could hang out at if she gets overwhelmed. It sounds like a non issue and she\u2019s an adult.", "INFO Does she act out like a child? Because all you said was that she has child like interests, but is otherwise a functioning adult\u2026? The reason people have child free Wedding\u2019s is so that the kids behavior does not interfere or distract. If she behaves appropriately then you are simply discriminating against her .", " YTA, it isn't just \"your special day\". Your fianc\u00e9 said that they didn't see a problem with her coming. You need to step back and realize you are being a little irrational in this situation. You would be justified for not wanting her to come to the wedding she was not capable of sitting quietly at a wedding, but she has already proven this. You are entitled to your own opinion, and I understand you want a perfect day, but that doesn't give you an excuse to be an AH to your family.", "YTA\n\nWhat ever her issues she is a legal adult, and if she has been ok at other family weddings then why shouldn't she be allowed to attend yours.\n\nThis borders on discrimination.", "YTA-I don't even need to justify this. You are so very clearly the villain in this scenario.", "YTA. She *is* an adult. Nothing about this even begins to suggest your \u2018special day\u2019 would be \u2018ruined\u2019 by her attendance. You sound petty & irrational (at best).", "YTA. Autism =/= being a literal child", "So she has a job and works at a grocery store (dealing with shitty customers and co-workers all day) but apparently is too childish to attend a wedding despite never having a meltdown?\n\nMost likely troll post for sure but I'm bored so I'll take the bait - YTA", "YTA.

Next spring, I am getting married to the love of my life. We have decided that we don\u2019t want children at our wedding. Not many of our friends and family have young children, and the ones that do are fine with getting a sitter for the weekend since we gave them a lot of notice. The only ones to put up a fight are my aunt and uncle who have a daughter with autism. She is 20, but will be 21 by the time my wedding day comes around. She is what they call \u201chigh-functioning\u201d, which means she can talk and wash/dress herself, and she has some friends. She graduated from high school a couple years ago and is currently living with her parents (my aunt and uncle) while working at a grocery store. Despite her being technically an adult I just don\u2019t see her as such. Every time I talk to her at a family gathering it\u2019s like talking to a child. She is obsessed with toy ponies and barbie dolls, and brings them up at every opportunity. She draws in her notebook constantly and never makes eye contact when talking to me. She does not have loud meltdowns like other special needs kids I\u2019ve met before, but I really don\u2019t want to risk her ruining my special day. I told my aunt and uncle that I didn\u2019t want her there and they became very upset.

If she hasn't had a history of any meltdowns, then she's perfectly the same as everyone else. Autism doesn't mean jacksh*t crazy, there's tons of different forms of it.

You should learn what problems in an autistic person come from the autism and not the person.", "YTA. You may talk to her like she is a child, but that does not make her a child.
