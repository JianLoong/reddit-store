{"id": 289, "submission_id": "yi51iu", "title": "AITA for making my coworker come in to work hungover?", "selftext": "\nMy cowroker had a huge birthday party yesterday in celebration of her birthday, I attended, it was a pretty good night and we had fun. I left early because I\u2019m a college student and had a lot of homework, but from what I was told afterwards, she got absolutely hammered after I left. Understandable, after all it was her birthday and her party, but I got nervous after I realized she would most likely call in \u201csick\u201d and not come. Context: my coworker and I work at a small business, and me and her work the morning shift. Because we have been so understaffed, me and her have been taking turns every weekend to take a 2 hour break and come back to work the afternoon shift with another coworker since there is no one else to work the afternoons right now. She calls in \u201csick\u201d in the morning basically leaving me to work the morning shift by myself. I was able to handle it although it typically is a 2 person work amount, but I was a little annoyed and overworked to say the least. Knowing she was going to try to not show up all day, I called 3 separate coworkers to see if they could come in for the afternoon, all said no. I texted her (with plenty of time) that she was unfortunately going to have to come in for the afternoon as there was no one else that could. Instead of texting me back, she makes another coworker (who she\u2019s friends with) text me and ask me if I can work the afternoon shift for her and in return she\u2019ll work all day next Sunday. At this point I\u2019m pissed off. Working the afternoon shift for me would mean an 11 hour work shift with no break on top of working the morning shift by myself. I tell her to drink a Gatorade and take a cold shower because I would be leaving at the time of my clock out time. She then gets mad saying she offered to work all day next Sunday (aka my birthday) and that I should understand that she\u2019s very hungover and can\u2019t work. I tell her she already did me dirty once today and that I have homework to do. I also told her if she knew she had to come in to work and didn\u2019t get anyone to cover her, she shouldn\u2019t have gotten so wasted. On top of this, said coworker took a week off of work to go on vacation the weekend prior and I had to essentially cover her and work all days all weekend meanwhile she had worked one shift since coming back. My managers were drawn on this saying they wouldn\u2019t want her here hungover and that one full day without a break and a late assignment wouldn\u2019t hurt but also that it was unfair to me given the vacation and overtime I\u2019ve had to work lately. She ended up having to come in bitter and a little hungover. We are not speaking to eachother and both pissed off.

She has responsibilities and needs to plan around them.", "NTA, but the real villain is your employer.  You\u2019re understandably frustrated because you\u2019re overworked, and that\u2019s not really your coworker\u2019s fault.  Your employer is not working hard enough to hire and retain employees, if you\u2019re chronically understaffed.", "NTA. People shouldn't get so intoxicated that it lasts into their working hours. It is, however, a management decision, and I do believe you have insufficient management in this situation.", "NTA You are right. Your coworker should have arranged for someone to cover her shift or made sure she wouldn't be too hungover to come in. She knew she'd be screwing you over and expected you to just take it. \n\n>My managers were drawn on this saying they wouldn\u2019t want her here hungover and that one full day without a break and a late assignment wouldn\u2019t hurt\n\nYeah, it wouldn't hurt *them*. Shame on them for thinking that you not having a break all day and having trouble at school is acceptable as long as they had someone to work the shifts.", "NTA. In advance I'd like to say I haven't read the entire post but based off of the first few sentences... it's crazy how entitled some people can be. A \"birthday\" is just another day when it comes to adulting, your job, and everyone around you. Want to celebrate? Go crazy. Want time off? Wait for the weekend or use a vacation day (or find someone to cover if you're working a job like that.) You're not special because you stayed alive another year, and your coworkers should not have to be punished and forced to work around you because you think otherwise. \n\n\"You\" in this situation being the coworker, not *you.* I've had some confusion in the past with my wording, lol.", "You both have shit bosses. They are the AH's of this tale.\n\n* Why in the ever loving hell have the two of you been covering everyone's shifts for weeks now? \n* Why aren't the other staff members doing their shifts?\n* Why aren't the managers or owners stepping up and covering the shifts?\n* Are you aware that in most places 11 hour shifts are actually illegal?\n\nI think your coworker is quiet quitting, and only doing her actual job, as is her right. So no, that doesn't make her an AH.\n\nI'd suggest OP also quiet quit. You are being taken advantage of, and it is disgraceful for your manager to tell you that it is unfair to make you work, then to make you work! They are also wrong about your assignment. One day late is usually the loss of one letter grade. That could absolutely make or break your end of year score.\n\nNAH for the sake of a judgement between OP and coworker.", "NTA. Imagine being this stupid. Sounds like she wasn\u2019t planning on coming in either way.", "NTA Book time off the next day if your going to get wasted an 11 hrs shift with no break that she just assumed you will do if anyone is the A H it's her", "NTA\n\nYour management team on the other hand\u2026\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to be trying to staff a shift. That\u2019s a manager\u2019s job. And your friend is also an AH for not making a plan in advance or finding her own replacement.", "Just show up for your shift and leave at the end. No one else to cover? Lock the place up and go home. Your bosses are shit. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nLord when I think of the hangovers I've worked through..... it's hell but it's a choice you make knowing you're gonna pay for it the next day, and you do what needs to be done so that you don't make coworkers pick up after you.\n\nAs others have said, it is your bosses who are the truest AHs here, and please beware of getting taken advantage of because you have compassion for 'small family business owners' when they are not showing compassion for you. \n\nBut anyway, that still doesn't mean your hungover coworker gets to bail and put everything on you because she had a birthday, especially after you already covered her morning *and* tried to find her cover for the pm. That's more than enough to be grateful for already and it's straight up rude she tried to lump you with the afternoon as well.", ">My managers were drawn on this saying they wouldn\u2019t want her here hungover \n\nThis isn't your problem - it's their job to find staffing, or to cover if they can't. After all, they're getting paid much more than you.\n\n>and that one full day without a break and a late assignment wouldn\u2019t hurt\n\nSure, it doesn't hurt *them*, but both of these things hurt you. If you burn out, they're not going to pay you while you recover, they're just going to replace you. And they're not going to ask your instructor for an extension on your assignment, or make it up to you if you get a lower grade. Not to mention that if you have to submit this assignment late, you're likely to be cutting into time you should be putting towards your next assignment.\n\nYou're NTA, but your managers are massive ones.", "NTA but you need to reframe your thinking about your work place. Their lack of staffing should not be your responsibility. Show up for your shifts and clock out when they are over. If the store doesn\u2019t have the coverage then I guess they are just gonna have to close early. Do not make their business failings your problem. It\u2019s not worth it for you. I\u2019ve worked for many family owned small businesses and they will push anything they can off their own plates and pile it on everyone else\u2019s. If they want to be successful then they have to do the work. Do only what they pay you for. The slack is theirs to pick up.", "Nobody is TA - It's the managers job to deal with employees and who works which shift.\n\nBe mindful that she might now not bother to cover your shift on your birthday.

Maturity is that you plan things that allow you to get to your job. One can adjust birthday or other celebrations to not be on a night when there's a day off the next day to allow for recovery time. Also management is definitely an Ahole for keeping the company short staffed. Sounds like profits in the management pocket are more important than paying enough workers.", "NTA. Calling in sick to work due to being hungover is completely unacceptable, and I say this as someone who likes to drink. If you go overboard, it\u2019s on you and you deal with the pain, ESPECIALLY if it affects your coworkers. I don\u2019t understand how your managers condone this sort of thing.", " NTA", "NTA-but make sure you don't call out on Sunday after getting hammered on your birthday or you WBTA.", "NTA\n\n11 hours with no break? Is that even legal?!? \n\nJust lock up and leave at the end of the shift. Your managers suck.", "NTA hair of the dog works better than you think", ">I also told her if she knew she had to come in to work and didn\u2019t get anyone to cover her, she shouldn\u2019t have gotten so wasted.\n\nYou're right.  You cant be at work all day.  She has nobody but herself to be angry at.  Working hungover sucks but when you drank like a fool the night before with no regard about the next day, who else can be blamed for that?  NTA", "ESH it's not your job to micromanage your coworkers, just clock in when you're scheduled and leave when you're scheduled, the managers can do some work for once.", "So I guess this is an unpopular opinion. People are allowed to call in when they like. You can clock out when you are done with your shift. Do yourself a favor and stop over working for a place that obviously doesn't care about you. I definitely think YTA because she doesn't have to if she doesn't want to, being understaffed shouldn't be anyone's problem but the bosses.", "Just realized how stupid I sounded. I\u2019m tired lol and I agree I\u2019ve showed up to work (not too hungover) because I knew they needed me", "I told her the same thing. Her defense was \u201cbut it was my birthday and you could\u2019ve stayed\u201d justifying that i could use the money anyways. Lol.", "Does she though?\n\nThe way I'm reading it, OP and coworker have been covering everyone else's responsibilities for way too long.\n\nThere are at least 5 others that could cover that shift. 3 other coworkers and 2 managers mentioned, possibly more.", "^^^^ THIS. \n\nUnless your job title includes the word \u201cManager\u201d or \u201cSupervisor\u201d, making sure shifts are covered isn\u2019t your responsibility. Your employers aren\u2019t trying hard enough to fill in the employment gaps because they know you feel a (misplaced) sense of loyalty to the job. They won\u2019t have motivation to solve the problem until they are forced to feel the pain (lost revenue because they don\u2019t have adequate staffing for regular business hours and/or customer complaints because of poor service when one person is trying to do work meant for two people). \n\nStop covering your coworkers shifts. Work your scheduled hours. Clock out when your shift is over even if your replacement isn\u2019t there. Let your employer know that you have a previous engagement (not their business what it is, even if it is laying on your couch) and just can\u2019t stay any longer. Idk how much you are getting paid, but I doubt that it is enough to take on the responsibility of keeping this business afloat. It is hard to hire right now, which means you won\u2019t have a problem finding a new job when you are fed up with this one.", "This is hopefully just a rough patch we\u2019re going through, I know there\u2019s a shortage of staff in a lot a lot of places right now so I *try* to cut them some slack. But my employer also isn\u2019t jumping at trying to hire anyone either which is really frustrating as well. It\u2019s a family owned small business so I try to work with their struggles.", "But coworker is *not* doing her actual job. She's bailing on it because she's hungover.\n\nI'm all for ripping the employers to pieces here, but coworker is by definition not doing her job when she's pulling a sickie cos she partied last night.", "I agree. My management is not doing the greatest job handling their employees right now. It\u2019s frustrating but I do love the job and the staff is like family so I really don\u2019t want to leave. I\u2019m going into work on my birthday though, since we are understaffed and I might as well.", "But the coworker was rostered on and supposed to work, if she knew she was going to party and be hungover, she needs to give notice so they can find someone to cover the time. ESH except OP", "It was just a little redundant and gave me a laugh. But yeah! It's just total lack of accountability on her part. Kinda sucks that it might damage friendship between you guys but she can't just do that. If you guys discussed covering shifts so the other could get totally shittered, ok then great, but she can't just force it on you.", "That's insane. She's taking zero accountability and even trying to push it on to you. Sounds pretty entitled", "Something she ~~should~~ could benefit to learn from very, very soon is that \"her birthday\" is everyone else's Monday. If her not coming in directly affects the day-to-day of anyone else working then any potential excuse may as well be told to a tree. It sucks to be the \"mean and strict\" higher-up but that's genuinely the only way the vast majority of people listen, especially if there's not much of an age gap (which I kind of assume seeing as you attended a party\u2014I don't really invite my older coworkers out but every situation's different.)", "Is she six years old? If she's old enough to have a job, she's old enough to know that she has responsibilities. Being her birthday is not an excuse. Even six years old go to school on their birthday day. She needs to grow up ASAP.", "It was the coworker shift. She decided to call in sick because she had a hangover.", "Hey just cuz they work there doesn't make them obligated to pick up someone's slack, especially someone who doesn't even seem to be working as much as the rest of them at this point. People do not get paid enough, even to cover shifts, to come in on their days off.", "Don't do that. They will take advantage of you bc they see you'll put up with bullshit. Sounds like they already are. They don't give a fuck about you. Find a different job that's properly staffed.", "And do they go out of their way like that to take care of you?  Only give an employer as much extra effort/care as they give you, at most.  It is exceptionally, extraordinarily rare for an employer to put their employees first, so you have to put yourself first.  They won\u2019t.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re suffering an enormous amount of stress and frustration and a pretty unpleasant amount of being overworked.  It would be reasonable to go to your employer and tell them that you\u2019re tired and frustrated and over-worked, and if they won\u2019t get someone else hired and trained and on the schedule, you\u2019ll find another job.  If that doesn\u2019t light a fire under them, you\u2019re better off leaving.", "Be careful that you don't offer to cover shifts too often becsue management would rather over work you than look for and pay for another employee. You don't want to burn yourself out, especially with your studying too.\n\nHopefully you and your coworker can work this out and continue to be friends.", "It is not really your family. The fact that your managers thought it would be fine for you to work 11 hours without a break and have a late assignment shows that your concern is not returned. You will be used as much as you offer yourself up to used, but you shouldn't expect to get anything in return. You'll just miss out. \n\nNote that they aren't jumping to make sure you don't have to work on your birthday after basically being fine with the idea of you being railroaded into covering for a coworker not coming in after her birthday. In both cases all they care about is having someone there to do the work."]}
