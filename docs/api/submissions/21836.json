But I would still say NTA rather than N-A-H here, simply because people seriously need to stop assuming that the way things are done in their country is the way they're done everywhere. It's incredibly stupid to assume that same law exists in every country. The non-asshole response would be to simply *ask*, \"Can you do that here? Is that normal here?

There's a law in SK that prohibits patrons from getting their beverage in a paper/plastic cup UNLESS they're immediately leaving the establishment after collecting their order.

She's annoying.", "Your friends friend is The AH , if I was that friend ( your friend) I would have second hand embarrassment and told my friend off for making a scene for something I knew you did for years and plus its pretty clear nobody that was in the immediate circle thought of it being wrong if they thought it was the slightest rude , trust me your friend would've giving his or her friend a heads up specially knowing that this person's family owns cafes and that coffees is that important to them", "Waitress for 20+ years.\n\nI don't really care which vessel you want your coffee in, I'll even fill your own travel mug, if you ask haha", "NTA.

Not a particulary asshole move, but you are creating waste unnecessarily. \n\nI've worked in a few cafes in Melbourne and Newcastle that refused to do it unless you had a keep cup.\n\nNTA but be concious of how much wastage you create, single use coffee cups account for an absurd amount of plastic waste in the world and it can be seen as inconsiderate therefore.", "Your friend has too much time on her hands. What possible difference can this make?", "NTA. This friend of a friend is a control freak. Avoid hanging out with with them again and enjoy your coffee how you like.", "NTA.
