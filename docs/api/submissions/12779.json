Every single one of those people can rotate housing Debbie and her family.  Man, that was an easy fix.  Usually these things are hard!  :-)\n\nGood luck!", "You have no obligation to house people who abuse you. NTA, plain and simple.", "NTA. You don't need to have her and her negativity in your house. She's never been nice to you, so you don't need to feel obligated to house her. \n\nNext time you hear people throwing shade your way, ask them why they haven't offered to save them from homelessness.", "Set up a Venmo and ask her family members to donate for apartment rent. They will get real quiet real quick.", "NTA\n\nDebbie is rude and abusive to you, so there should be no expectation she should be allowed to stay in your house. I'd suggest all these family members judging you offer up rooms in their own house for her to stay.", "NTA. Where is the rest of her family at? Why does it have to be you? She has been nothing but rude and mean to you. \n\nThe family that is critiquing you should open their doors instead of making it your fault. None of them offer but judge you? \n\nYour wife's sister is experiencing consequences of her actions of being an ass. \n\nYou could help out but I wouldn't want someone who has treated me poorly in my house. Family is a privilege, not a right.", "NTA. Are the people who say you're making them homeless, offering to take them in? Why are you the only option - considering she seems to despise you, surely she'd ask everyone else first?\n\nI'm glad your wife is supporting you. Stand your ground. She'll soon realise what goes around comes around.", "NTA. You can't treat people like crap and expect them to come riding to your rescue when you need help. Especially when the help is to *house* them", "NTA. Debbie should have known there would be consequences like that time I tried to hit a wasp nests with a bat. But I understand that you can\u2019t predict what will happen in the future", "NTA\n\nThe people in your wife's family saying you're an ass are more than welcome to bring Debbie into their home. Also, home is where you should be relaxed. Bringing her into your home would make an even more stressed out Debbie lash out even more. It sucks for your niece, but at the same time, why were they that far behind on rent to get kicked out to begin with? They could have asked for help from family before it got to that point to begin with.", "Given what you\u2019ve recounted here, I can\u2019t see how there would be a judgement beyond NTA. She chose to alienate you over a long period of time. She\u2019s now reaping the rewards of that behaviour. I\u2019m sorry for her child. But given that they lost an apartment after a couple of months of losing one of two jobs\u2026 perhaps she and her husband should have had a better financial plan in place, including a multi-month emergency fund.", "I can't be doing with people who think it's fine to treat people like shit then demand something from them when it suits them. Absolutely NTA.", "Sounds like Debbie should\u2019ve focused that energy on planning an emergency savings fund instead of being a child.\n\nThey also either waited til the last minute to ask for help or still have 90days until they are evicted.", "Absolutely NTA.  There\u2019s no question here - Debbie should never be allowed in your house given how she\u2019s treated you.  She has two other siblings- let her go mooch off of them.", "NTA Lucky for Debbie, she has some family members who are on her \u201cside\u201d and who should be more than willing to house her.", "NTA. I thought about suggesting you let her stay with you as long as she is nice: says nothing bad to or about you. Reading your whole post, though, I doubt she\u2019d last 24 hours.", "NTA what goes around comes around. Don\u2019t be a jerk.", "NTA - any family who disagrees can provide housing to Debbie and her family.", "NTA\n\nOh my.  The very person that called you unfaithful and emotionally abusive wants to now live with you and your wife?  How the tables turned.  Karma was sitting somewhere with a beer in hand chuckling.   Let those who said you would make SIL and family homeless take them in.  \n\nYour wife is supporting you so you're good.  Enjoy your peace.", "NTA because your wife agrees. If your wife disagreed, I would suggest you go to counseling and withhold judgment, because that would be a lot more serious.", "I mean everyone will say NTA and you are not, but if you would like to improve your relationship with her, rather than make it worse, just allow them to say, but put a hard date to it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
