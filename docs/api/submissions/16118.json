My dad and Lucy met at a support group for grieving widows and widowers and they were dating almost immediately after meeting, which was 6 months after my mom died and 11 months after Lucy's first husband died. Lucy has a daughter Maisie who was 7 when her mom married my dad. \n\nMaisie and I never got along. We are toxic together. Pretty sure the reason is we were two grieving kids, who lost a parent, struggling with the loss of said parent and the our surviving parent marries the others and suddenly the stepparent is being over pushy and calling us their kid and we're not getting what we need from our actual parent.\n\nLucy especially was bad. She called me her daughter before they were officially married and she told me years ago that she was saving her engagement ring from her first marriage for me, which was a family heirloom her parents gave to her first husband. I told her then I didn't want it and she ignored me. She even ignored her own parents saying they wanted Maisie to have it and not me. She was offended they would treat me as less of a grandkid. But it's true. They are not my grandparents and I am not their granddaughter.\n\nNow I'm 17 and Maisie is 16 and I don't know exactly how it all happened. But Maisie was told by Lucy that the engagement ring from the marriage to Maisie's dad was being saved for me, as her oldest daughter, and Maisie lost it. She yelled and screamed at her mom that she is her daughter, not me, that her dad proposed to her with the ring, not mine, and if anyone should get it next, it should be her. I was yelled at next. At the time I was oblivious to the fact she had yelled at her mom. But Maisie called me a thief, said she hated me, said I should have died with my mom instead of stealing hers and stealing a memory of her parents marriage and that I was a selfish bitch. I couldn't believe Lucy told her own daughter she was giving me her ring, after I said I wouldn't want it. So then I yelled at Lucy. I told her I didn't want her stupid engagement ring, that it was meaningless to me, that she would never be my mom and if she thought the ring would do anything but go to waste if saved for me then she was mistaken. I told her to give it to her own daughter and stop being such an uncaring mom to her.\n\nMy dad told me about the stuff Maisie said to Lucy after I had stormed off. He told me I piled on Lucy and it wasn't right. He asked me why I had to be so angry about the ring and I told him nobody but Lucy wants me to have it and I'm seen as selfish when I don't want the damn thing and told her as much. He said I owed Lucy an apology and to give her as my mom a chance because he's tired of us being a fractured family. He also told me I was a real asshole to Lucy. I told him that's what you get when two fractured grieving families get forced on each other.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682939908, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134jnug/aita_for_screaming_at_my_stepmom_that_i_dont_want/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The woman he married was recently widowed after he divorced my mom. She had a teenaged son. Super nice kid. Anyway, he wanted us all, my sister too, to be one big happy family and every time he'd make plans with my sister an I, he'd invite her along so I'd cancel. And it would make him really sad.\n\nAnyway, my point is, I think romance makes parents forget they're parents. They think because they've moved on from the old ways, so has their children. And that everyone needs to be a happy family together. Which is bull. I think everyone gets along in their own way, and your dad and his wife shouldn't try to force y'all to be one big unit.\n\nYour step-mom is insane for forcing the ring on you. If she ever does try to pass it to you, I'd give it to her daughter. Like, right in front of her if you're able to, but the point would be, you and everyone else knows who should get the heirloom. And you're making it known by at the very least, giving it to your step-sister.\n\nI don't understand why family is such an important concept for people, I really don't. It makes them do such oddball things to each other, and they're genuinely blind to the consequences.", "Nta", "What a horrible situation, you and Maisie growing up with such grief. Hugs to you, NTA. You had told Lucy you don\u2019t want the ring. Why is she forcing it on you? In front of Maisie? Somehow she thinks she can build a relationship with you with that ring, she should focus on her own daughter and how all of this is destroying her. In an ideal situation, your dad focuses on you, her mom focuses on her. But of course it\u2019s way more complicated. Also, family therapy.

Masie is absolutely right about the ring. \n\nYou said about the grandparents chiming in. I wonder, are Masie\u2019s paternal grandparents in the picture?

Go to family therapy if you haven't and do it again if you have because it didn't work. Talk to Maisie and let her know your views.", "NTA Im a full ass adult and I would die on this hill for you. Don't apologize. Your dad failed you. He didn't give you time to process and grieve before throwing a whole new family on you and just expecting to move on. I can only imagine how damaging that was and then to have this woman playing pretend and trying to force you to accept her as your mom is just an added layer of bullshit. I'm so sorry.", "NTA, I agree that the ring has nothing to do with you. Also, Lucy put you in a shitty situation in front of Maisie making your turbulent relationship worse.\n\nIf I was Maisie I definitely would have flipped too. Years of pent up neglect just surfaced. You got caught in the middle and that blows. In my opinion Lucy got what she had coming especially since you have already told her you don't want the ring. I know \"two wrongs don't make a right\" but sometimes it feels like the only solution.", ">He said I owed Lucy an apology and to give her as my mom a chance because he's tired of us being a fractured family.\n\nHe made that family so he gets what he made.

They are doing literally everything wrong here. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You Don't Force family. Lucy just got the wake call. She caused her own daughter more grief. For no good reason.

If I was in her shoes I would have taken you both out to a jewelry store and given you both a limit to choose something you each like.\n\nYou may owe your step mum an apology not for what you said but for the yelling, you also need to have a serious conversation about the whole situation with you Dad and explain to him why you're so frustrated.(Which is a very valid way to feel about this situation.) Perhaps you could sit both of them down and do this at the same time. You should have to be the adult here but someone has to be.\n\nYour step-sister needs to calm down, I hope someone tells her you never wanted it and she apologises to you.", "ESH\n\nEveryone of you is in a situation which could have been handled so much better by you all.

Apologize to Lucy for saying those nasty things. Afterward, tell her how you really feel about the situation with Maise and your dad present. She isn't your mom. She is your stepmom and that is a different role. She needs to accept it, and so does your dad. If they do, maybe you can have a better relationship. Make it clear that the ring belongs to Maise, as it is from her parents' marriage and belonged to her biological grandparents, and that anything else is inappropriate.\n\nAlso, give Maise a chance to speak her truth too, even if she annoys the sh\\*t out of you. I think what your parents did to you was very dismissive of your grief and the relationships that both of you had with your parents that passed away.", "NTA it was the ring from Maisies mom and dad...what is wrong with this women to try to force it to you....my guess is she just doesn't want to see the ring from your mom and dad (which is the ring that should be yours!)", "NTA you cannot force your kids to play happy family just because you want to", "NTA. Giving it to you just doesn't seem to make sense. It feels like shes trying to force one big family when you are in fact all blended together by circumstance.

I can\u2019t imagine how difficult it was for you and Maisie to lose a parent and then suddenly have another \u201csubstitute\u201d and a stepsister thrust upon you while you were still grieving.

I can not imagine what goes trough Lucy's mind when she wants to give the ring for you instead of Maisie as it belongs to her fathers legacy. You have the right to have the memory of your mom and Maisie has the right of the memory of her father. Your step parents shouldn't be forced themselves in a situation where they want to completely replace the original parent. I think you should seek therapy as a family.", "NTA.

You should apologise to Lucy for yelling at her, but stay firm on not wanting the ring, and demanding respect and autonomy.\n\n(Then you should bond with Maisie over your parents being irresponsible by forcing you into a bad home environment.

We'll never be one and I am pretty much just waiting to cut and run and never look back.", "I think that was always going to be impossible given the dynamics that were at play. Her mom focused on me while my dad focused on her. It meant we sort of lost both our parents and were forced to deal with a stranger trying to take over the role entirely. Jealousy and grief can be harmful at times but mix them together and it's never going to end well.", "> but you should not speak to anyone like that. Ever. Apologize to Lucy for saying those nasty things\n\nI disgree : it was long overdue that they were made to wake up to their failure to parent properly.", "My dad did the same with Maisie.

I don't really blame her for feeling the way she does.", "I honestly don't care about making us a family after all this time. I'm almost free from this. Dad and I don't really have much of a relationship and I'm pretty sure it will be the same with Lucy and Maisie in another couple of years. Family therapy only works when you want to be a family or are a family. Ours was always more in name only than practice and for me it's not worth saving anything. Maybe if I'm just gone Maisie will actually get the ring. Or maybe Lucy will always hold onto it and think of it as belonging to me. But I won't play a part in that.", "I don't think a time will ever come where Maisie and I can bond. With the ring thing I can guarantee she will always see me as the bad guy and the person who not only took her mom from her but tried to steal the engagement ring from her parents marriage.", "I do mildly feel for sorry Lucy and your Dad: it must be really hard when your kids don't get along, but as you yourself rightly say: you can't *force* people to bond, especially when you were both  grieving etc. And yeah, I feel for Maisie too after reading what you just added. I get what the two parents were trying to do, and why, and how hard it can be, but fuuuuuuck, they need to let it go and allow the two of you to co-exist neutrally rather than try to force closeness.", "The right is rightfully Masie\u2019s, no doubt about that. Why does Lucy seem to hate her own daughter?", "Could you talk to them, maybe? Explain the situation with Maisie and the ring. They might be able to get through to her and make her see that you and Maisie are essentially suffering the same trauma and you're actually on her side in this.", "I'm not trying to turn you into one. I'm trying to suggest to you a platform for you both to air our why you won't be a family. Family Therapy isn't to \"become one\". Good luck because this sounds horrible and I wish you all the best. Maybe just talk to Maisie, you're both in the same lousy boat trying to keep paddling despite the (ass) holes.", "That may be true, but it's still unfortunate.", "But they didn't wake up, did they? Her dad asked her to apologize to \"her mother\". It accomplished nothing. Only a calm discussion with some boundaries afterward is going to help the situation. She needs to tell them that she refuses to refer to this woman as her mother and correct them every time they do it until they stop.", "Agreed. Sometimes you have to go nuclear.", "Ignore this person. You are not an asshole and neither is Maisie. The only assholes here are your parents. \n\nYou should tell Maisie that as soon as they give you the ring you will give it to her. And don\u2019t let your parents know this plan, obviously.", "I can't get over you being only 17, because you are so wise about all this. It took me into my 40s to figure this shit out.\n\nWhen my mother died, my father married a divorced woman with a kid the same age and sex as me. We never fought but we never bonded either. I have been home or spoken to my brother since I left home at 19. Forty years ago. I don't know even if they are alive. Your dad and lucy are setting you and maisie up for the same situation.", "I hope you are wrong, since Maisie should realise this is not your fault. I do wonder if this is a \"last straw\" situation, where for her it's not really even about the ring, but is about her resenting *any* attention that Lucy gives to you, because Maisie feels Lucy is not giving enough attention to *her*\u00a0\u2014\u00a0which is more or less what she shouted.\n\nBut at the end of the day, you really cant/dont care what Maisie thinks about you, do you? \n\nAnyhoo: do not apologise for any of this to anyone. They needed to hear it.", "Yeah, I get that, and that last part was honestly optional, seeing as you're an adult soon. But maybe, hopefully, in time Maisie will see that it wasn't your fault, and that you didn't want to take either her mom or her mom's ring.", "Yeah, and I know it bothers them that we also don't really care for the spouse either. Lucy is not someone I would go to with a problem or particularly care for. Maisie feels the same way about my dad. They tried to make a family but it was always in name only.", "Ah okay. I think whenever I see that, I assume it's suggested with the idea of everyone walking away being closer and repairing stuff. What you said makes sense. \n\nI think Maisie sees me as the biggest asshole now. First I stole her mom and now the ring (in her eyes) and I'm not sure I can say anything to change how she feels about that. I can't blame her for seeing it that way either. Her mom has been so intense with me and really pays no attention to her now.", "I hope so. But so much harm has been done by the two \"adults\". Their grief led them to making choices to help them but they kind of forgot their kids along the way. It sucks too because I do feel like I lost both my parents within a year of each other.", "Like I say: ironically this could bring you and maisie closer at last: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\n\nLucy seems to have no fucking idea how to parent evenn her own kid: the ring thing is so bizzarre and horrible.", "No, its a misconception. Family Therapy isn't to create this fake happy family. It's to air out issues in a safe way with an impartial person.\nI wish you all the best.", "I'm so sorry for you, and for Maisie. My ESH is more \"every*thing* sucks here\" than \"everyone sucks here\". I hope things get better for you.", "Yup. They were totally selfish.", "They can be. But I don't think Maisie will ever consider me a friend. After the ring thing... I don't know that she won't always hope that I die and leave her alone.\n\nLucy and my dad are both like that now. But my dad wasn't always. Grief changes people and not always for the better.", "Of course! I asked for people's honesty and I don't mind the response. Thanks for the kindness!", "Like I say, you are wise beyond your years.  I guess grief  and parental neglect can do that too, they can force you to mature fast."]}
