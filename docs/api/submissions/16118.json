Lucy has a daughter Maisie who was 7 when her mom married my dad. \n\nMaisie and I never got along. We are toxic together. Pretty sure the reason is we were two grieving kids, who lost a parent, struggling with the loss of said parent and the our surviving parent marries the others and suddenly the stepparent is being over pushy and calling us their kid and we're not getting what we need from our actual parent.\n\nLucy especially was bad. She called me her daughter before they were officially married and she told me years ago that she was saving her engagement ring from her first marriage for me, which was a family heirloom her parents gave to her first husband. I told her then I didn't want it and she ignored me. She even ignored her own parents saying they wanted Maisie to have it and not me. She was offended they would treat me as less of a grandkid. But it's true. They are not my grandparents and I am not their granddaughter.\n\nNow I'm 17 and Maisie is 16 and I don't know exactly how it all happened. But Maisie was told by Lucy that the engagement ring from the marriage to Maisie's dad was being saved for me, as her oldest daughter, and Maisie lost it. She yelled and screamed at her mom that she is her daughter, not me, that her dad proposed to her with the ring, not mine, and if anyone should get it next, it should be her. I was yelled at next. At the time I was oblivious to the fact she had yelled at her mom. But Maisie called me a thief, said she hated me, said I should have died with my mom instead of stealing hers and stealing a memory of her parents marriage and that I was a selfish bitch. I couldn't believe Lucy told her own daughter she was giving me her ring, after I said I wouldn't want it. So then I yelled at Lucy. I told her I didn't want her stupid engagement ring, that it was meaningless to me, that she would never be my mom and if she thought the ring would do anything but go to waste if saved for me then she was mistaken. I told her to give it to her own daughter and stop being such an uncaring mom to her.\n\nMy dad told me about the stuff Maisie said to Lucy after I had stormed off. He told me I piled on Lucy and it wasn't right. He asked me why I had to be so angry about the ring and I told him nobody but Lucy wants me to have it and I'm seen as selfish when I don't want the damn thing and told her as much. He said I owed Lucy an apology and to give her as my mom a chance because he's tired of us being a fractured family. He also told me I was a real asshole to Lucy.

I think whenever I see that, I assume it's suggested with the idea of everyone walking away being closer and repairing stuff.

Her mom has been so intense with me and really pays no attention to her now.", "I hope so. But so much harm has been done by the two \"adults\".

Everyone is just selfish and over emotional. Yikes.", "ESH\n\n1.) You don't get to decide how other people should feel about you. Your step mother might not be your mother but that doesn't mean that you're not her daughter. She doesn't have to use those words if they hurt you and she cannot insist that you ever use them. No one should insist on that or try to force a mother-daughter relationship on you. But you're not allowed to determine what goes on in her heart and her mind. \n\n2.) None of what you folks did had to be done with screaming or insults. Yinz need to learn how to respond to your emotions in an appropriate manner. You're all just hurting each other for no reason. Your folks might be misguided and handling it poorly but that doesn't mean that you or your sister have to. You seem like a pretty insightful person-- learn from their mistakes. \n\n3.) All of you need to clean out your ears, shut your pie holes, and listen to one another! Whether you like it or not, whether you like your teammates or not, you're a team. You're all supposed to be working together but it's impossible to cooperate if you don't actually listen to what your teammates are saying. \n\n4.) Toxicity does not have to be permanent. There are things that can be done to actively reduce it. There is a possibility that your family can be a functioning unit. But it's pretty obvious that yinz don't have the skills and expertise to do it on your own. Family therapy is there for exactly these kinds of issues.  \n\n5.) It seems like all of you are acting on a deep need to create your own emotional reality. Whether it's one where your family is completely separate or one where your family is loving and affectionate.

My loss was of that, a father. I miss him deeply and often become upset at the idea of losing my mother. Op, my love. May I extend my advise? Let down your guard and go sit with your father. Allow yourself to miss that mom of yours WITH him. Tell him you needed more time, tell him you needed more of him, tell him your heart belongs to your mother and your reflection belongs to a mother you never were allowed to grieve. You miss HER. It shows OP. Sometimes the answer is harder to DO than accept. If he does not listen, than separate yourself from him after you turn 18. Get counseling or become a counselor, use that compassion and empathy that you have, to help others. This is deep. Lucy needs therapy. Your dad needs a reality check and your step sister needs her mom. You are truly right about fractured household. You're very smart it seems and I like that about you. I send a long hug your way. Internet forehead kiss too. I'm sorry sweetheart.", "Accept the ring then give it to Maisie", "NTA.  What was Lucy thinking?  The ring was given by Maisie\u2019s father and this means everything to Masie and nothing to you.  \n\nI commend you for realizing that, but do wish you had been able to phrase it more delicately.    \n\nMight I recommend you telling Lucy that you were hoping to get your mother\u2019s ring instead?  As well as letting Maisie know that you had refuses the ring from that start saying that it should go to her.  Yes Maisie went to far in saying you should have died, but I can understand the hurt of something of her father\u2019s being given away like that.  Neither you or Maisie are AH\u2019s in this, that is completely in Lucy and her misguided attempts to treat the two of you the same in regards to an item of Maisie\u2019s father.", "NTA.  This is what happens when a person says \"No,\" but the other person doesn't listen.  I don't know how Lucy got hooked on the idea that giving you this ring would make the family whole, but she has clearly chosen to die on that hill.   And it's natural when people don't listen to a polite no, to escalate it into a screaming rude no.  \n\n\nCan I suggest that you take the ring, and give it to Maisie?  That might work to get all of them to STFU.  But I suppose Maisie would be right to throw it back in your face, because she doesn't want *the ring*, she wants *Lucy to give it to her* as the rightful daughter.  \n\n\nOk, now I suggest that you tell Lucy (privately) that if she gives you that ring, you will immediately sell it.  Maybe that will get her to change her mind and give it to Maisie.  \n\n\nDealing with manipulative people sucks.", "NTA  \nYour dad & Lucy are assholes. They shoved you two together w/o every giving you a chance to heal. They destroyed what could have been a good relationship with their pushing.", "NTA.  Of course you could just accept the ring and give it to her daughter.", "NTA sorry these are the adults left in your life. They\u2019re awful.", "I know you and maise aren\u2019t close but something tells me that Lucy  won\u2019t drop the ring situation and will find someway to give you the ring. so here\u2019s my suggestion once things have calm down, you and Maisie should sit down and discuss away for you to secretly give her the ring. Does Maisie have a family member who she trusts keep the ring safe for her because if this is a family heirloom, I highly doubt anyone on either side would be OK with Lucy, giving something away that is meant to be passed down in the family. Two I think another thing you could consider is to just play along and pretend to except the ring and then whoever your future partner will be let them in on the situation so that way, they don\u2019t also feel pressured into taking the ring and then before you leave for your honeymoon find someway to give the ring back to Maisie, or at least put it in a safety deposit box until you can find a way to give it to her. Please mention to your partner that you prefer your own ring.", "NTA what is wrong with Lucy!! And your dad trying to force a relationship just doesn't work.\n\nI would have a chat with Maisie and explain you never wanted or asked for the ring and had told Lucy that numerous times before, you know you're not friends but you wanted her to know that.", "NTA  I don't understand this need people have to replace Moms and Dads in children's lives.  Especially when they are old enough to remember the parent they lost.   It's sad and disturbing.  This is not on you OP.   This is bad parenting that has gone on for far too long.  I'm assuming there has been no therapy.  Everyone in the family could probably use it, but Lucy needs it along with a parenting class as quickly as can be arranged.  She's screwing up.   She also has no idea what a 'family' heirloom is.  Sad.\n\nHang in there.  You and Maisie can make it out of this.  And get therapy as adults.  Maybe someday you can be friends or at least cordial.  You are the only two people in the world who understand the toxicity of where you came from.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. in your other comments i saw you said you\u2019re moving out soon. personally, i would tell Lucy i want the ring when i move and i would immediately give it to Maisie. i would also make these intentions known to Maisie as soon as you speak with Lucy and ask her to keep it to herself. if the ring is given to you and it\u2019s yours, it\u2019s yours to do with what you want, including giving it to your sister to show her the kindness and validation she should of been getting from Lucy all along. i know you\u2019ve said you don\u2019t want to be a family, and i understand, but at least you and Maisie could leave things on good terms. i think that would be very healing for you both and it would leave things open for you to have a united front with Maisie should you ever be involved for some reason in problems with your father and step mother again.", "NAH - It says something that Lucy was willing to keep the tradition by giving it to the \u201coldest\u201d but I understand how you feel. Instead of yelling at Lucy, it would have been better to tell her that if she gives the ring to you, you are just going to give it to your stepsister, so she might as well cut out the middleman.", "Why all the screaming from grown ups? That alone would make YTA", "NTA", "NTA.  Lucy sounds insufferable and got what she deserved. I am sorry you have to deal with this BS. Lucy and your father BOTH owe you an apology.", "NTA\n\nIt is a symptom of a larger problem.", "I don't think anyone is at fault there. People forget parents are at the end of the people. They think and behave in ways that they think are solving the issue. Lucy probably didn't want you to feel like she treated you and her daughter differently, which I think is admirable. Did she take it too far? yea, but she tried. I get your sister's anger. I get why you reacted as well. But telling someone who has seen you as their daughter \"hat she would never be my mom and if she thought the ring would do anything but go to waste if saved for me then she was mistaken\" seems rude. You should definitely smooth things over with your stepmom.", "NTA\n\n\"Lucy, I'm not your daughter and you need to stop forcing the issue.  You have been pushing it so hard you haven't even realized you've pushed away Maisie and made her feel lesser than,, and she's taking her anger and frustration out on me for it.  Stop trying to make me your child.  You have one. Maisie. If you keep this bullshit up,, you will lose her and you will have no one to give your ring to. \"", "NTA - but when you tell her you don't want the heirloom I would add that it only serves as a reminder that your mother is dead.", "NTA here's the happy ending: you use this as an opportunity to form some kind of positive relationship with Maisie. Apologize to stepmom, take the ring and thank your stepmom, make a secret agreement with Maisie that it's 100% hers and apologize for her mom being weird about it, wait til Maisie meets \"the guy\" give it to him with her consent, avoid the explosion from your stepmom. You'll be an adult/maybe moved out/in college and how badly do you need to maintain a relationship with her?", "NTA. I definitely feel for you kids.  You were all grieving.  Your dad and step-mom found each other during that process and found support in each other, but were unable to give you the support you needed.  Sounds like they tried too hard too quickly to make you into a new family and it backfired majorly.  Now everything is screwy.  \n\nHowever, here you are - this is the situation you have and the situation you have to deal with.  It seems that everybody in this family needs to chill out.  The screaming and yelling is atrocious.  You don't have to like each other.  You don't have to feel like a family.  You do need to treat each other with common courtesy - you are human beings to need to coexist in the same sphere.   I know others suggested counseling and you said that family therapy only works if you want to become a family.  I think you should look into individual therapy, not to build a relationship with any of these people, but to develop tools to navigate your cruddy family situation and to work through your own issues so that this whole thing doesn't follow you around and negatively impact your life in the future.  \n\nRegarding the engagement ring situation - sounds like Lucy is still trying too hard to build that mother-daughter relationship with you and she's got it in her head that giving you this ring is a way to do it, even though it is clearly a bad idea.   And it is strange that she's bringing it up now.  You and Maisie are both teenagers - marriage is probably at least a decade away for both of you, if you even decide to get married some day.  Who knows what your future holds?  Maybe she feels like this is her last chance to build this mother/daughter relationship before you reach adulthood, so she's redoubling her efforts.  My advice is to apologize to Lucy for yelling and to tell her once and for all, that you don't want the ring and this is the end of that discussion.  Then tell Maisie the same.  If either brings it up again, remind them that you aren't talking about the ring anymore and then change the subject or physically leave the conversation.  No yelling and screaming - just reiterate your boundaries.", "Nta. I\u2019m so sorry that this is happening to you but I hope that your outburst can finally get the point across. Maybe sooner or later try talking to Lucy about how everyone is seeing you as the villain even though you don\u2019t want the ring.", "NTA\nMy heart is breaking for Masie.  I\u2019m sorry that your well meaning parents are screwing up so badly.", "Everyone here really seems to want to give you a pass, but it definitely sounds to me like you acted like an AH. Maisie and your stepmom being AH's doesn't give you a free pass to act just as bad. You said purposely hurtful things to your stepmom, and whether or not she is oblivious or made a mistake, doesn't make what you said any better. If you just said no to the ring, that's fine, but \"stupid\", \"meaningless\", \"uncaring\", are words you chose to hurt your stepmom. You are judged by your own actions, not the actions of others. ESH", " You have the opposite problem. Good luck.", "*\"Dad, Lucy is your wife - not mine. And when she performs poorly, you get to address it as her husband. But, accusing me of being the bad guy while your wife is so obviously alienating her daughter and making it my responsibility is just not a reasonable thing for you to do. If you're going to fix someone - then just help Lucy see where she's making a mistake.\"*", "Agreed", "Maybe in the future I will forgive him. But the relationship is over. It's been over for a long time. I lost both my parents within a year and Maisie lost both her parents too.

It was a support group but neither actually took up therapy really.", "I feel so bad for the poor girl. Her dad died and then her mom abandoned her for you.

Set this up now. Honestly, set it up with Maisie AND her grandparents, with the best option I can think of being that you give it to grandparents to bequeath it from them to Maisie, that way you're playing nice AND giving Maisie and her grandparents what they want. \n\nAlso, maybe talk to Lucy that while you appreciate she sees you as her daughter, the ring is inappropriate for your relationship, as it is a symbol of her relationship with someone who IS NOT your dad. Be willing to sit down and choose something that may be more significant a memento for you and Lucy (even if it's not great, maybe there is something that would be a nicer and more welcome trinket, or doing something that creates a nice memory between you now that may be a link to something to give you later that IS NOT something tied to Maisie and her dad.)\n\nHaving a blended family is tough, no matter what. My mom and step-dad got together when I was 6, my step-siblings were 16 & 22. My siblings and I always had a much better relationship with our older step-sibling than the one who was a teen when we met (30+ years later and we still barely tolerate each other.) Don't feel bad if you never have a relationship with Lucy and Maisie that resembles your dad and Lucy's idea if happy family. Sometimes that never happens, sometimes you get to tolerance only or you do find that you can be a happy family and truly blended, but accepting that happy family isn't now is the best thing every can do.\n\nThe only jerks in this whole thing, OP are your dad and Lucy.

She\u2019s over stepped and made it clear to her bio child she would be giving a ring her dead father gave to her to her step child that wants nothing to do with her and has already said she didn\u2019t want it.

You clearly have unhealthy ways to communicate things. And boundaries are either non existent or not respected. You saying no to the ring multiple times should be the end of it. And also, you're 17.... this doesn't even need to be an issue until one of you is potentially getting engaged in the near future. \n\nYou can stop treating it as a big thing, set boundaries, and get on with your life. No is a full sentence. No thank you, I'm not interested in the ring. Repeat as many times as necessary. And when Maisie or someone else is giving you a hard time, stay calm and just hold those boundaries.\n\n \"You screaming and calling me names is not ok.

Yes, but instead of shouting at her or arguing with her, speaking to her in a rational, mature way would have been more conducive to a better outcome. Same with Maise and her Mom.

It\u2019s what you call the person you love and trust in a motherly capacity. \n\nSometimes, I think the surviving parent gets caught up on the fist definition and forgets how important the second one is. They see that the family now has a vacancy in the Mom department and they want to fill it as quickly as possible because they know that kids need Moms, but they\u2019re in such a hurry that they miss the truth of grieving.  \n\nThe fact of the matter is, for grieving kids, there will always be a vacancy in the parent department.

She was welcome to him. I only attended family events that she would be attending at my dad's parents and families homes. She was welcome to attend we didn't have to interact.

I would only attend one holiday every other year at my dad (her mom's) home but that both my SO and our children would be attending and spending the night before and after. Same holiday every other year so she could plan and have the excuse to be at her husband's family every other year.

Same for holidays you regarding at the other grandparents homes. Once you tell your parents what you and Maisie have agreed and that since it makes the most sense to the two of you, and that the two of you are lock step on it maybe Lucy will accept her place in your life is only as your dad's wife.

Your step-mom can then handle it from there if she wants to try and take it away.   \n\n\nI understand the mom is trying to extend an olive branch to you, but she's not listening to what you're saying and that's not acceptable imo. You don't want it, it's not your dad that used it to propose, and the family that the heirloom means the most, the younger daughter AND YOU all want the younger daughter to have it because it will mean more to her. This is wild behavior on the mom's part.", "NTA.\n\nFor one thing, you didn't know Maisie had already yelled at Lucy, so you weren't piling it on her deliberately - you were responding to the yelling you recieved, for which she was to blame. For another, you had told Lucy beforehand that you didn't want the ring, and she ignored you. On the other hand, Maisie, her daughter, did want the ring, had a natural right to it, and Lucy told her she wouldn't get it. And all that for what? To feed some kind of fantasy narrative Lucy and your father are clinging to, that you are the Partridge family? Delusional.\n\nCombined families don't come together that way. Learning to live together takes patience and respect, not only between the adults, but also - and more especially - between the adults and the children. This isn't the first story here of step-parents trying to force themselves as \"real\" parents to their stepchildren, who aren't prepared to accept them. It never ends well. Not that step-parents can't be great - I've seen cases of love, nurturing, patience and respect that created great relationships. But this is not the way to do it.", "NTA.\n\nMy suggestion? Talk with Maisie. Tell her the ring is hers. No matter how things with your stepmom play out, the ring is Maisie's. If it is physically handed to you, you can hand it to Maisie.

You both lost a parent in death, and not long after, because your dad and Lucy soon became more interested in each other, you each lost the support and attention of the surviving parents.  For the situation to have worked at all, Lucy should not have jumped in and called you her daughter, given you the kind of attention, and promises (like the ring), that you didn\u2019t ask for, didn\u2019t want, and that put a target on your back with Maisie.  Can you imagine what it was like for her to see that?  She might have thought that she was going to lose what was left of her mother and that she preferred you over her.  It would have been devastating for her.  And you do know, because you were going through similar stuff too.  I\u2019m not sure that Maisie has as much insight as you do, maybe because she\u2019s younger.  If ever there was a time to have this conversation with her, it\u2019s now.  You were two hurting little children who didn\u2019t know how to direct your grief, upset, and anger, so it got directed at each other.  In a different situation you may have been friends. You may never be close, but you could at least stop being angry with each other, because it\u2019s misplaced anger.  You need to talk to Lucy and explain to some extent that her actions, although well intentioned, are putting that target on your back, and that Maisie needs to know that she is her number one.  Anger is so draining, and it\u2019s got to stop.  I believe that you have it within you to make things change, and start helpful dialogue.

I feel like you and your stepsister are long overdue for a good talk. Making it clear how you feel about stepmom and the family situation. It might give her the opportunity for your stepsister to open up about her feelings about it all as well. You might never be the bestest friends but to have an ally in a situation where it's so easy to feel alone and ignored (feelings wise) counts for so much more than a forced sibling relationship. Maybe she won't hear you at first but there's a lot of good advice, opinions, experiences and perspectives in this thread. If she doesn't want to hear you first, showing her this might create an opportunity for you guys to talk it out. Good luck and all the best wishes OP!", "I\u2019ve noticed a lot of these stories have a lot of Lucy\u2019s in them. Lucy causes a lot of trouble huh. (Yes I know it\u2019s common to use that name instead of the real name) I just think it\u2019s funny I\u2019ve read like 10 stories about Lucy so far", "Why not be more selective in picking your battles\u2026 accept the ring & then just give it to Maisie?  While I understand your childhood was less than ideal, it sounds like your stepmom was welcoming & tried to treat you as her own instead of like an outsider. Something to be appreciated; seems like an effort was made which is more than I can say for a good number of other step parents. Your anger I think is misdirected & I can see how your father might feel the way he does.", "This was my first thought. Take the ring. Give it to Maisie.\n\nOr take the ring and give it to Maisie's grandparents for them to hold in trust until Maisie is old enough to receive it without Lucy taking it back, because you know 100% that if the OP tried to give the ring straight to Maisie, Lucy would take it back.", "OP and Maisie are not brats. They were children when placed in an awful position. Calling them names is mean and not fair. Something is wrong with both of their surviving parents, you know, the adults. To the OP, you need an advocate outside of the home. Is there an adult on your paternal side that you can reach out too? Someone you can spend time with away from that house? This is unnecessary stress on top of grieving your mother. I wish you well."]}
