My dad and Lucy met at a support group for grieving widows and widowers and they were dating almost immediately after meeting, which was 6 months after my mom died and 11 months after Lucy's first husband died. Lucy has a daughter Maisie who was 7 when her mom married my dad. \n\nMaisie and I never got along. We are toxic together. Pretty sure the reason is we were two grieving kids, who lost a parent, struggling with the loss of said parent and the our surviving parent marries the others and suddenly the stepparent is being over pushy and calling us their kid and we're not getting what we need from our actual parent.\n\nLucy especially was bad. She called me her daughter before they were officially married and she told me years ago that she was saving her engagement ring from her first marriage for me, which was a family heirloom her parents gave to her first husband. I told her then I didn't want it and she ignored me. She even ignored her own parents saying they wanted Maisie to have it and not me. She was offended they would treat me as less of a grandkid. But it's true. They are not my grandparents and I am not their granddaughter.\n\nNow I'm 17 and Maisie is 16 and I don't know exactly how it all happened. But Maisie was told by Lucy that the engagement ring from the marriage to Maisie's dad was being saved for me, as her oldest daughter, and Maisie lost it. She yelled and screamed at her mom that she is her daughter, not me, that her dad proposed to her with the ring, not mine, and if anyone should get it next, it should be her. I was yelled at next. At the time I was oblivious to the fact she had yelled at her mom. But Maisie called me a thief, said she hated me, said I should have died with my mom instead of stealing hers and stealing a memory of her parents marriage and that I was a selfish bitch. I couldn't believe Lucy told her own daughter she was giving me her ring, after I said I wouldn't want it. So then I yelled at Lucy. I told her I didn't want her stupid engagement ring, that it was meaningless to me, that she would never be my mom and if she thought the ring would do anything but go to waste if saved for me then she was mistaken. I told her to give it to her own daughter and stop being such an uncaring mom to her.\n\nMy dad told me about the stuff Maisie said to Lucy after I had stormed off. He told me I piled on Lucy and it wasn't right. He asked me why I had to be so angry about the ring and I told him nobody but Lucy wants me to have it and I'm seen as selfish when I don't want the damn thing and told her as much. He said I owed Lucy an apology and to give her as my mom a chance because he's tired of us being a fractured family. He also told me I was a real asshole to Lucy.

They needed to hear it.", "Yeah, I get that, and that last part was honestly optional, seeing as you're an adult soon. But maybe, hopefully, in time Maisie will see that it wasn't your fault, and that you didn't want to take either her mom or her mom's ring.", "Yeah, and I know it bothers them that we also don't really care for the spouse either. Lucy is not someone I would go to with a problem or particularly care for. Maisie feels the same way about my dad. They tried to make a family but it was always in name only.", "Ah okay. I think whenever I see that, I assume it's suggested with the idea of everyone walking away being closer and repairing stuff. What you said makes sense. \n\nI think Maisie sees me as the biggest asshole now.

Her mom has been so intense with me and really pays no attention to her now.", "I hope so. But so much harm has been done by the two \"adults\".

Everyone is just selfish and over emotional. Yikes.", "ESH\n\n1.) You don't get to decide how other people should feel about you. Your step mother might not be your mother but that doesn't mean that you're not her daughter. She doesn't have to use those words if they hurt you and she cannot insist that you ever use them. No one should insist on that or try to force a mother-daughter relationship on you. But you're not allowed to determine what goes on in her heart and her mind. \n\n2.) None of what you folks did had to be done with screaming or insults. Yinz need to learn how to respond to your emotions in an appropriate manner. You're all just hurting each other for no reason. Your folks might be misguided and handling it poorly but that doesn't mean that you or your sister have to. You seem like a pretty insightful person-- learn from their mistakes. \n\n3.) All of you need to clean out your ears, shut your pie holes, and listen to one another! Whether you like it or not, whether you like your teammates or not, you're a team. You're all supposed to be working together but it's impossible to cooperate if you don't actually listen to what your teammates are saying. \n\n4.) Toxicity does not have to be permanent. There are things that can be done to actively reduce it. There is a possibility that your family can be a functioning unit. But it's pretty obvious that yinz don't have the skills and expertise to do it on your own. Family therapy is there for exactly these kinds of issues.  \n\n5.) It seems like all of you are acting on a deep need to create your own emotional reality. Whether it's one where your family is completely separate or one where your family is loving and affectionate. It's because all of you are hurting and all of you are seeking comfort.

Same as my dad. They married and acted as though they swapped kids when we didn't need their spouses, we needed our actual parent.", "I think the time for talk is long passed.  Civil or otherwise.", "Therapy isn't something I want with them. There's no family to fix. Just the shells of two previous families that are likely broken beyond repair.", "You're just taking an untenable position to get attention.  Or You're a friend of Lucy's.", "Just to tag onto this. Talk to Maisie. Tell her you don\u2019t want the ring and you know it means a lot to her, so if her mom won\u2019t listen and gives it to you, it will go right to Maisie. Apologize that it won\u2019t mean as much coming directly from her mom, but it is hers by right. Then tell Lucy the same thing, that no matter what that ring will end up with Maisie, and she only has one choice if she wants to fix the mess she caused.", "Accept the ring and then give it to maisie.", "Maybe get with Maisie and come up with a plan to extract the ring from Lucy to be given to Maisie. Explain you don't want it and the Lucy is trying to force it on you. Even if you don't like each other, you can still work with each other over than area of common ground.", "This is the sad truth about parenting mistakes around overcompensating with step kids or favoring anyone. It poisons sibling (and step sibling) relationships.", "don't apologize, sit down and tell Thema all , dad,her and her daughter, you never wanted this ring, and she shall stop pushing you with it. she is and will never be your mother and she should finally accept it, you don't owe her apology, she should finally listen to her listening properly! she not only hurts you but especially her own daughter to do with her!", "Maybe take the ring now and give it back to Maise\u2019s grandparents so they can keep it for her. Who knows what her mother will do with it if you refuse it.", "Highly doubt she has stopped caring about her daughter because she\u2019s trying to do right by you. Or in this case do a nice thing as misguided as it might be. The ring does belong to her daughter. Thats the only thing you might be right about.", "I don't think you can stop your parents from getting with each other.", "Go With them to one only session and Tell in Front of the therapist exectly that, here is no Family and the parents Need to exept this .", "That sounds really weird and downright obsessive.", "This would absolutely be the right thing for OP to do *if* the ring is still left to her in a will. But as long as Lucy is alive, doing this isn't the ideal solution.\n\n Maisie isn't focused only on who has physical possession of the ring, she is also upset because her mom is choosing to give the ring to OP over her. It seems Lucy has a history of prioritizing OP over Maisie in order to try and win OP's affection. If OP calls Lucy back, gets the right, and gives the ring straight to Maisie it's still a situation where Lucy's engagement ring was given to OP over Maisie. \n\nGiven the emotions involved, I think OP's stance is the right one. She should absolutely refuse to even *touch* that ring. It either stays with Lucy or Lucy herself gives it to Maisie.", "I don\u2019t. They pushed two grieving children into a brand new family within a year of their actual parents dying. Tried to force the kids to call them \u2018mom\u2019 or \u2018dad\u2019 when their real moms and dads were still freshly in the goddamn grave. These adults let their grief over shadow their children\u2019s and failed said children spectacularly. They didn\u2019t care what the kids wanted or needed, they just cared that their own pain was eased", "I don't really feel sorry for them. They trauma bonded then moved too quickly for their grieving children. Irresponsible. Understandable but still irresponsible as parents.", "I don't feel sorry for them at all,  this all literally their own fault the biggest rule of blending families is you do not force relationships, they ignored this and in turn created the very toxic and angry relationships they are dealing with now. Did they get the family into therapy? Both parents supremely overstepped and forced the relationships on to the children and, in turn, ruined any chance those kids had to bond with each other or the parents. Like this ring thing is just the icing on the cake, it represents every boundary Lucy has crossed with OP, and every time she fails to be a mother to her biological child. These parents were selfish all they cared about what their feelings and what they wanted and their children suffered for it. NTA", "I would die on this hill for you. Don't apologize. Your dad failed you. He didn't give you time to process and grieve before throwing a whole new family on you and just expecting to move on.", "She has not put any effort into her daughter since she tried to take over the role of my mom. Dad has been the same with me. Lucy focuses only on me and dad focuses only on Maisie. We lost our real parents and are now left with people we do not want stepping into those shoes.", "NTA \n\nOp\u2019s dad and stepmom are delusional, and I don\u2019t think a calm vs angry approach would have made any difference whatsoever. From the post, this is not a new development in their relationship; OP has tried telling her about her feelings/ that she didn\u2019t want the ring before this interaction, and OP was ignored. Being ignored and then having someone wish death upon you because you were ignored is gonna push most people to a breaking point, especially when they\u2019ve made their feelings on the matter known. \n\nOP also said in a comment that they are considering cutting them off at 18, and that seems like the best choice.", "I don\u2019t feel sorry for them AT ALL. They totally screwed the pooch on integrating their two small families. If they had just let those two children have space to breathe, and grieve, and adjust instead of forcing \u201chappy familyhood\u201d on them, there\u2019s a chance they\u2019d be friendly today, if not friends. Any competent therapist could\u2019ve guided them through this.", "Someone in these Fricken grief groups needs to tell people to slow the heck down.", "I know you and Maisie don't have a strong bond, but I can tell that you are very emotionally intelligent and that your heart is in the right place, even if this whole thing has just made you angry. It's glaringly obvious that you believe that ring should be Maisie's. I would suggest having a private and civil conversation with her. Tell her how you feel about the ring being on reserve for you, tell her that in your eyes and heart that is HER ring and you could never take that from her. Remind her that this ring is a symbol of *her* parent's marriage and that it belongs to *her* even if her mother tries to pass it off to you. Promise to hand it over to her the next time her mother tries to give it to you. \n\nPlease remember that this is not either your or Maisie's fault, and that even though we can all see that, she may hold anger or place blame on you. Even if you don't get along, even if you don't *want* to get along.... getting that ring for her would probably be the kindest and most thoughtful and selfless thing anybody in her \"family\" has ever done for her. \n\n\nThen... save up and get the hell out of there.", "Text her instead of a face to face convo. Just let her know that you\u2019ll never take the ring and if Lucy tries to give it to you then you\u2019ll immediately give it to Maisie. Maybe throw in an apology for the years of bad blood if you want but I\u2019d understand if you don\u2019t want to do that, since I\u2019m sure Maisie has been very hostile for a while now.", "Show her this post? Maybe that\u2019d be enough for her to see you agree with her on this? \n\n\nI think u/vanriel \u2018s  idea of talking to her grandparents is a good one as well. \n\n\nNTA, OP, and I honestly think you\u2019ve been too patient with Lucy and your dad.", "A friend of mine came out of family therapy knowing she wanted to go full \"no contact\" with her dad, and with the full support of their therapist to do so. It's not all about reconciliation.", "Don\u2019t listen to this person, you are the only one who understands your situation. A lot of people respond with their own personal traumas and feelings coming into play.", "I think OP will probably have to go NC. I think all yelling does is give them an excuse to vilify her and focus on that instead of the real problem, which is the reason I fell like it solves nothing.", "This is a really good idea and circumvents OP having to speak to Maisie. In her replies it seems OP is pretty sure Maisie does not want to talk to OP at all so this would be a very respectful way of approaching this issue.", "I am not sure this is a good idea. I know you're trying to help, but it may just drive home the fact that it's not Maisie's choice what happens to the ring, OP is deciding. \n\nAnd anyway, I think the ring itself is secondary. The real hurt comes from her mom choosing OP over her yet again, on such a personal issue.\n\nMind, I do think OP should give the ring to Maisie if it does come to her, I just don't think there's much to be gained from talking to Maisie about it, at least right now.", "Yes thats whats happening\ud83d\ude44", "It's ironic, normally its the other way around.  The step wanting the ring that should belong to the child whos Dad gave it to her.  You have the opposite problem.  Good luck.  \n\nNot sure she has a clue how badly she is hurting her own child.", "You are telling a 17 year old in a clearly toxic situation you know better than her, it\u2019s ludicrous and your inability to accept that you may be wrong is telling. You have zero say in the choices of an individual, just because it\u2019s abnormal for you doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not the reality. Plenty of parents care more about themselves and their ideas of a relationship then the good of the child in question.", "Yeah OP and Masie need to have a basic conversation. \n\n1. Your mom is *your* mom, I don't see her as my mom. I will make it clear whenever I can that she is your mom and not mine, and redirect her to you.\n\n2. Likewise, i understand you feel similarly about my dad. If you wanted, you could do the same (make your feelings clear and redirect him to me) and that way we have a united front\n\n3. *Of course* the ring should belong to you. I think it's crazy that they're considering anything else. I will be vocal that it should go to you. If they override both of us and give it to me, I will immediately give it to you.\n\nY'all don't have to like each other, but y'all aren't enemies here. You want the same thing (peaceful coexistence, your own parent, no sister bond or blended family). \n\nNot sisters, but allies. And if you both work together on it, you have a better chance of success. Less fighting is a powerful motivation for your parents to back tf off", "You\u2019ve completely missed the point.  The possession of the ring is not the real issue.  The issue is that because the two adults in this house have utterly and completely screwed up this whole situation and have done so since day 1.  \n\nI get being lonely and scared to be a single parent. Yet it seems that both mom and dad have only done what each of them wanted for themselves and gave very little consideration to the emotional needs of the young girls.  \n\nIt was huge betrayal for both children that their parents \u2018moved on\u2019 so quickly.  Neither of them were ready for that and it was absolutely forced upon them. Next, Lucy, in some very sad  needy way, had to be \u2018mom\u2019 to a grieving child and tried to force herself on this emotionally distraught little human. \n\nThat move is likely at the very root of this mess. Both girls resent Lucy for those efforts and frankly, it\u2019s entirely predictable.   Years later and Lucy is still oblivious to the resentment and pain she is causing. \n\nLucy needs to be reigned in by her husband and then she needs to go to both girls and make it right by apologizing and changing her behaviors towards both of them, give up on her fantasy of instant family reassure Maize that she is her only true daughter and gods sake, stop trying to make fetch happen.", "I agree, the parent situation seems hopeless but it would be nice if the girls could get along. They are in a difficult period of life and having a supportive peer in the same household would definitely benefit both of them.", "I understand that. But there is nothing OP can do about that. The adults need to fix that and they will have to deal with the fall out in the future. I was suggesting a way to help mend a relationship with her step sis if she wishes too. She has no need to do that but from what I read from her comments she does not seem opposed to that."]}
