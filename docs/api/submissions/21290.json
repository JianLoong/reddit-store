She said she would rather sit in a room full of noise and mess than spend a single second with me.\n\nOur parents are angry with her and they're angry with me for staying out of my sister's way.

It is possible to be autistic and independent and if they hadn\u2019t been more focused on your relationship with each other they could have worked on her independence to help her when she wishes to live alone. Major red flag on there part and now they need to open there eyes to what they have done and how them pushing and forcing your sister to have a relationship with you has made her develop hate and if they had just made the necessary adjustments before you was born to help her adjust to the change and to the new environment then It would have made it much easier growing up for your sister", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry that you have to go through all of this. You are right that your parents are responsible for not helping your sister learn to be independent, thrive as an adult and most importantly foster a healthy relationship with you. With this being said I think that down deep your parents really aren\u2019t angry at you but angry that what you said is true. Unfortunately over the years you have learned to stay out of the way in an effort to respectful of your sister. I encourage you to continue to do so until you graduate and can get out the house; then leave like your butt is on fire. Go out and get the life you deserve.

Reality came knocking and they don\u2019t like it\u2026 wah\u2026.. They need to get their shit together.", "NTA, you just stated facts, and it's time for your parents to open their eyes.\n\nFrom your words, it appears that your parents did a terrible job: they ignored your sister's autism, treating her neurodivergence as a whim and thinking she would get over it. They made your sister's life - but yours too - miserable, they didn't teach her independence (it's possible to be autistic and independent, but parents have to work hard during adolescence and yours didn't), they have possibly ruined the relationship between you and your sister forever.", "Dear OP I am truly sorry for both you and your sister. You are both not at fault and I say you are NTA. It saddens me that your parents choose to ignore her autism and they are not helping you both. But actually are driving you both apart. You did nothing respecting her need for distance. Oh I wish I could give your parents a talking to\n\nOP, have you tried talking to a school teacher or school counsellor about your situation? If you prefer to chat with a doctor or get in touch with a specialist please do so. Don't be afraid to tell them what is going on and I hope for both your sakes that you will get help and hopefully someone to have a word with your parents", "NAH. It's a tough situation for everyone involved. Your sister's struggles are valid, but it's also understandable that your parents didn't know how to handle it perfectly. It's important to have open and honest conversations as a family to find a balance that respects everyone's needs.", "NTA. As an autistic person, I can tell from the way you\u2019ve written this that you understand your sister more than your parents ever will. What they have done is not fair to either of you. She doesn\u2019t have the space she needs, hasn\u2019t been taught the life skills to be on her own, or coping mechanisms for dealing with stress. You haven\u2019t been able to engage in your hobbies and are forced to room with someone who has said they dislike you. \n\nAre you able to have a talk with your sister and explain your feelings to her, how you think your parents have failed the both of you, and ask if there\u2019s a way you can (reasonably) accomodate her (perhaps even a written note or text message if she doesn\u2019t want to speak with you)?", "I think it's a reverse UNO going on here. I think your parents wanted your sister to be comfortable with you so that you would take over the duties of care giver when the time came. Now that you are actively avoiding your sister, out of kindness not malice, you are thwarting their plans. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThis is a combination of your sister being autistic, and being jealous of a sibling. You\u2019re correct in that your parents failed your sister in both aspects, and you\u2019re very mature in how you handled everything.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems as though your parents need to decide on the living arrangements your sister is going to need for the rest of her life. And, your sister will NOT want you as her advocate and/or guardian, so your parents need to start making arrangements immediately. \n\nYou do what you need to do for yourself. If you want to and are able to, then maybe you can support your sister from afar.", "Why did your parents even have children. They seem to have put zero thought into the whole endeavor.", "No sweets you are so far removed from being the asshole. You are being treated like shit from your parents and your sisters autism. You are still so graceful as to recognize the real issue at hand is actually your parents. There was so much they could have done to help her adjust instead of building a bigger rift. You are such an incredibly mature guy.\n\nNTA", "NTA you\u2019re right if they can\u2019t handle her she needs to move to assisted living. Honestly it would be best for her.", "NTA", "NTA \nAren't you a great kid. You are so much more in touch with you sisters needs than your parents are. They messed up and I'm sorry for both you and your sister. You shouldn't feel the need to turn yourself down to accomodate your sister but plans should have been put in place many years ago to help with this upset. I wonder if you and sister could work together to find balance, it may be too far gone to start now but it also might be worth a shot (for example: either of you wearing headphones for music, certain times of day where you don't \"make a mess\" so sister has wind-down time etc).", "NTA\n\nYou are very mature to have such a nuanced view of your sister\u2019s reactions. Good on you for realizing she just processes things differently.", "NTA / NAH. Your situation hurts. So does everyone elses mentioned.

They lacked the parenting skills they needed to deal with her issues and have done her a huge disservice.", "NTA- It is their fault, whether they admit it or not.", "NTA OP and you were spot on with all you said.\n\nI'd also suggest you write a letter to your sister around when you leave, explaining your side to her and that you'd like to keep in touch with her/ develop a relationship in her terms. Just give her the choice without expectations or strings attached, it will be in her if she wants to move forward. But I can't really blame her if she decides not to.", "NTA. Weird the child needs to teach their parents the truth. This is indeed fully on them for making the wrong parenting choices. The truth might hurt sometimes, but as adults they should be able to take some honoust feedback.", "NTA. not at all. You hit the nail in the head in describing your parents behavior. It\u2019s like they completely ignored her diagnosis. You seem to have more empathy and knowledge about your sis than your parents. They\u2019re mad at you because you told the truth.", "If you choose to have kids, you automatically opt in. You don't get to opt out when life throws you unexpected challenges.", "I don't disagree with that in its vaguest generalities, but life doesn't always fill in for two decades of unexpected challenge with no end in sight. The interplay with OP presumably hasn't helped. Having to move across country at least once can only have made things worse for everyone. If the idea that the sister is incapable of functioning alone holds true, they're stuck as caretakers for life. No parent is perfect and this scenario sucks, as presented, for everyone.", "NTA, it is beautiful that you are so empathetic and compassionate to your sister's needs when they have such a negative impact on your life. You're a good kid.", ">They're mad at me for blaming them\n\nBecause you're right", "You\u2019re NTA and your assessment is spot on.  You should not have been the subject of her disdain ever and the moment it started she should have been in a lot of therapy.  Autism is a challenge but it\u2019s not an excuse for abusive behavior.  They could have managed her better.  Earplugs, dedicated space, adaptive techniques to minimize her discomfort and shield you.  They failed. \n\nIt might be time for sister to be transitioned into a program that will allow her to start to learn independent living skills. You will likely need to work with a therapist to heal your own wounds and make sure you don\u2019t fall into a pattern of people pleasing and other things you\u2019ve been trained from birth to do by her unmitigated hurtful behavior and your parents denial.", "It is their fault - they did a bad job parenting a child with atypical needs. However, it is not too late to start teaching her life skills such as cooking, laundry, cleaning, etc. At some point, she will be on her own & needs help.\nThere may be state supplied help for her. But I don't know exactly where to start - maybe there's some redditors out there that can lend  a hand with help for resources.\nNTA", "NTA. You told them what they needed to hear.

You're nta, but I encourage you to not give up so much of yourself to appease your sister. At least for me, being 28, I have finally started making boundaries with my sister, and I wish I had done it sooner.
