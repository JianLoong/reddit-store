They made your sister's life - but yours too - miserable, they didn't teach her independence (it's possible to be autistic and independent, but parents have to work hard during adolescence and yours didn't), they have possibly ruined the relationship between you and your sister forever.", "Dear OP I am truly sorry for both you and your sister. You are both not at fault and I say you are NTA. It saddens me that your parents choose to ignore her autism and they are not helping you both. But actually are driving you both apart. You did nothing wrong respecting her need for distance. Oh I wish I could give your parents a talking to\n\nOP, have you tried talking to a school teacher or school counsellor about your situation? If you prefer to chat with a doctor or get in touch with a specialist please do so.

It's important to have open and honest conversations as a family to find a balance that respects everyone's needs.", "NTA. As an autistic person, I can tell from the way you\u2019ve written this that you understand your sister more than your parents ever will. What they have done is not fair to either of you. She doesn\u2019t have the space she needs, hasn\u2019t been taught the life skills to be on her own, or coping mechanisms for dealing with stress. You haven\u2019t been able to engage in your hobbies and are forced to room with someone who has said they dislike you. \n\nAre you able to have a talk with your sister and explain your feelings to her, how you think your parents have failed the both of you, and ask if there\u2019s a way you can (reasonably) accomodate her (perhaps even a written note or text message if she doesn\u2019t want to speak with you)?", "I think it's a reverse UNO going on here.

You\u2019re correct in that your parents failed your sister in both aspects, and you\u2019re very mature in how you handled everything.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems as though your parents need to decide on the living arrangements your sister is going to need for the rest of her life. And, your sister will NOT want you as her advocate and/or guardian, so your parents need to start making arrangements immediately. \n\nYou do what you need to do for yourself.

They messed up and I'm sorry for both you and your sister. You shouldn't feel the need to turn yourself down to accomodate your sister but plans should have been put in place many years ago to help with this upset. I wonder if you and sister could work together to find balance, it may be too far gone to start now but it also might be worth a shot (for example: either of you wearing headphones for music, certain times of day where you don't \"make a mess\" so sister has wind-down time etc).", "NTA\n\nYou are very mature to have such a nuanced view of your sister\u2019s reactions.

Weird the child needs to teach their parents the truth. This is indeed fully on them for making the wrong parenting choices. The truth might hurt sometimes, but as adults they should be able to take some honoust feedback.", "NTA. not at all. You hit the nail in the head in describing your parents behavior. It\u2019s like they completely ignored her diagnosis. You seem to have more empathy and knowledge about your sis than your parents.

You don't get to opt out when life throws you unexpected challenges.", "I don't disagree with that in its vaguest generalities, but life doesn't always fill in for two decades of unexpected challenge with no end in sight. The interplay with OP presumably hasn't helped. Having to move across country at least once can only have made things worse for everyone. If the idea that the sister is incapable of functioning alone holds true, they're stuck as caretakers for life. No parent is perfect and this scenario sucks, as presented, for everyone.", "NTA, it is beautiful that you are so empathetic and compassionate to your sister's needs when they have such a negative impact on your life.

You should not have been the subject of her disdain ever and the moment it started she should have been in a lot of therapy.  Autism is a challenge but it\u2019s not an excuse for abusive behavior.  They could have managed her better.  Earplugs, dedicated space, adaptive techniques to minimize her discomfort and shield you.  They failed. \n\nIt might be time for sister to be transitioned into a program that will allow her to start to learn independent living skills.

One thing that sucks about being autistic (even level 1 \u2014 previously called \u201chigh functioning\u201d \u2014 masking autistic who needs less care than your sister) is that people never seem to understand you. Being understood and accepted is like a fucking power source for me, and I\u2019ve heard many autists say the same. It sounds honestly like your sister might be able to function verbally and effectively enough that she could be much more independent with the right interventions and supports, your parents dropped the ball there, and she paid the price (as did you). You sound awesome, honestly, for how you\u2019ve maintained compassion in the face of her (frankly false, but she can\u2019t see that) blame of you.

This sounds difficult and I'm sorry your parents seem to have dealt with it by keeping their heads in the sand.  \n\nMy middle child is autistic and sounds a lot like your sister in the sense of liking routines, order, quiet time, and generally not being all that interested in socialization unless it's on their own terms.  I'm probably pretty lucky that they get along fairly well with their siblings although it is on their own terms (they will come and talk and hang out when they want and go back upstairs when they're done with people, basically.)  I've got no idea what I would have done had my kiddo not tolerated siblings, but I would have had to do SOMETHING other than keep pushing the siblings at them and hoping things would improve.  \n\nPushing you to share a room was never going to end well, and I suspect you'll have a better relationship with your sister with some distance maintained and your parents need to respect that.", "NTA- your parents failed both of you.", "Wow, NTA.

Ask you sister to meet with you and talk. On her terms when and where so she can be comfortable but still be firm enough to actually make it happen. \nTalk to her about it. From your post I think you care about her. Tell it to her.

Tell her you don\u2019t blame her, but your parents for not educating themselves enough on this subject. \nTell her you are staying for some time but you will eventually move out, so you want some ground rules between both of you to make you both comfortable for the next few months/years. Something both of you need to agree on. Tell her she don\u2019t need to have this conversation now and she can think about it and you can meet later. To make her aware of what she needs and what you need you can ask her what makes her uncomfortable the most, what she would want to change. Just don\u2019t let her be selfish. Stay firm on saying that she\u2019s as much entitled to be comfortable at home as you are. \nRevisit the conversation later and set the rules. If you want to tell your parents about them it\u2019s your call as you know them the best. Just so you know you are adult right now so treating you like a child won\u2019t be good. And you are the first of their kid to gain independence, so it might be hard for them. \nI know your sister is autistic, but from what you told us she more inexperienced to take care of herself not incapable.
