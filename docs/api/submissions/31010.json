Go to a step, or at the top of stairs or even stand on a box or stepstool. Stand backward like you're walking up, and hold on to something.  Have your heels hang off the edge of the step. Slowly lower your heels down as comfortably as you can go, the raise up so your feet are flat again. Repeat it about ten times (or more if necessary) and do it whenever you feel that numb, ball-like feeling in your feet. Then get yourself some cheap PF inserts for your shoes and wear them constantly.  Even in your house slippers.
