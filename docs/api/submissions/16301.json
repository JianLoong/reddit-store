However, the day has been announced for the same day as my husband's paternal family reunion. \n\nI've spoken to my husband about potentially wanting to ditch the reunion and go to the amusement park instead, (I would just go, and husband would go to the reunion alone, which also feels awkward because I feel like we should uphold the \"united front\" as husband and wife) and it started as a joke but I've been thinking about it since then. My husband has been supportive of the idea, but I don't really trust his judgement in social situations as he can be a bit ... apathetic. \n\nOn one hand, it's just a family reunion and will happen every year, and I'm unsure if the amusement park thing will happen every year again too, but it probably will. On the other hand, I can't help but think that FIL might feel betrayed or upset if he found out that I didn't come to the reunion in lieu of a day at the park. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I went to the amusement park day instead of the family reunion?\n\nETA: I thought I should update to clarify: the reason it wouldn't make sense to go any other day is because my company has set this specific date for the event, and park tickets and packages are discounted only for this day. The event also includes a good voucher. So while yes, I could go another day, I would just be spending at least 2x the money i would if I went on the scheduled day.", "created_utc": 1683117733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136jgge/wibta_if_i_ditched_the_family_reunion_for_an/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is just bad manners.", "It's important to connect with family AND friends.. why not plan just you and husband to see his family, or at minimum his direct inlaws, the week after/before?", "I mean, this is really about how FIL and the rest of your in-laws are going to feel about it, what a bunch of strangers on the internet think is irrelevant. If you can't trust your husband's read on the situation, then I think you should go with your gut as to whether there will be backlash and whether it's worth it.", "YWBTA.  It's nice that your employer is paying on this special day, but you can go to the amusement park anytime.  You could go every weekend if you wanted and could afford it.  The family reunion is once a year at best and people would be hurt if they found out you bailed for an amusement park.  The caveat here is that  your husband doesn't seem very invested and it's his family.", "YTA for ditching your husband and already scheduled event for wanting to ride roller coasters.

If not, then NTA. But only you know the family dynamics here. Is not going to the reunion going to cause problems with DH\u2019s family?

Personally, I think fun staff days are super important, so I think it's fair to just be honest if anyone asks you about it; you got an opportunity to do something you'd like to do for work and you aren't sure if you'll get another opportunity. It seems perfectly reasonable to me. Inevitably someone is missing for some reason from every one of my family's reunions, it has never seemed like a big deal. Your FIL will get over it and if he doesn't, well, that's on him honestly. It's hardly something to hold a grudge over.", "Why can't you do both?

Or the other way around?\n\nNTA but if you don't go to the reunion I'd ask the husband to tell folks you had a migraine and that's why you weren't there.

Go to reunion & you & hubby go to amusement park on a different day. \n\nNo one can really judge this because we don\u2019t know your husband\u2019s family.

And seems a bit odd that you would want to spend more time on \u201dwork\u201c things versus spending time with family when most people seem to complain that they don\u2019t get enough time to spend with family because of work.  On the other hand, I suppose if you don\u2019t really like spending time with your extended family, the \u201dobligation\u201c to attend a work event \u201cto be seen as part of the team\u201d is a good excuse to avoid people you don\u2019t like.  Of course, a family reunion is an excellent reason to miss the amusement park outing. \n\nIn that context, it really is a matter of your priorities.  Don\u2019t really know if it is a A H situation without more details.", "I\u2019m sure your husband would like you to be there for him, I think if you made it in agreement, it\u2019s wrong to step out of it.

Yes you\u2019re married but its not a reunion for you, you don\u2019t even know the people they are catching up with? Fil and husband can go together are they are the section of the family", "That's a good idea! I'm hoping to see some of my coworkers, but it really depends on who actually RSVPs to go and since the park is still open to the public, little chance that I will see everyone who comes, but yes one of my favorite things is casually hanging out with coworkers. Before COVID, I would go to people's homes and have parties or game nights, campfires, ect...I miss the camaraderie!", "You could say that, but it wouldn't be true.  The park is going to be filled with people, a few of which you know and might say hi to in passing as you head to the next ride.  I've been to a bunch of these over the years and they're fun but other than maybe meeting a few coworkers' kids, definitely not a work event.", "Agreed, 100%.", "It wasn't so much as we RSVPd as husbands father moreso told us what day the reunion was going to be on (since it is a yearly thing), and it is assumed we are going to go. I found out about the park day AFTER reunion was announced.", "That was my thought, too. Plus, I only know the immediate family anyway, which is like 2% of the people there. That's not a reason to not go to the reunion (probably more of a reason TO go), but a factor that I considered.", "Hmm, that is one way to put it. The situation was more like his father called and said \"the reunion is on x day\" and we are expected to go.", "Great idea! We have been wanting to have more frequent days where we go to his mom or dad's house and play games and have dinner or whatnot, this could be the thing to kickstart that.", "I agree with you about being partners and being together in this situation. That is why I am a bit torn over this. For your scenario:  It would truly depend on the situation and it's hard to put myself in that scenario because I am NC with most of my family and never really met the rest of them in the first place. But if there were to be a reunion and my husband really wanted to go to a work event, I feel like I would want him to go, as much of an anxiety riddled mess I would be lol. He has a hard time making friends, so I would be supportive of him going to a social work event. I've had to do things by myself before when I really didn't want to, but coming from me, I am more concerned with how others feel and experience life and so supporting him to me is letting him go. I hadn't thought of it this way before.", "Wow great point! I guess I have heard the \"united front\" phrase in cases where there has been family or financial issues as you mentioned and that doesn't really apply here. I was thinking of making a dish or something as an \"I am not here but I am thinking of you\" if I decide to go to the park instead... I think Im going to go through this post and the replies with my husband when he comes home. Thank you for your comment \u2764\ufe0f", "Thank you for saying this. I think I need to learn to trust my husband more when he says things will be fine. I tend to overthink and possibly be a bit over empathetic when considering my options. I do tend to focus on how others will feel over myself. \nI agree that fun staff days are important. Not only something to look forward to, but a different way to learn about and spend time with the people we work with ..the people that we spend a lot of our time with. \nAlso that's a good point about missing people from family reunions. I mean, hell, we recently had to attend a few close family funerals, and there were people missing from that too, due to school or work. \nAnd I feel like FIL will know that I would not be doing this out of malice. This is a lot to think about, thank you for your comment.", "That is an interesting thought that I hadn't considered before. The two places are within a reasonable driving distance (hour and a half), and the event isn't literally all day, I don't think, so we could possibly make that work, thanks for the suggestion!", "See this is kind of what I keep thinking about. I think about how I might feel if I didn't have my husband with me at the park (since it's large and I won't know every one --the park will still be open to the public), I could still have fun, and it would be a new experience for me to go somewhere like that by myself) but I also think about how much more awkward I will feel at the family reunion. I don't know like 90% of these people, and maybe that's why I SHOULD go. But i also think about him being there on his own. The thought doesn't seem to bother him at all, and he can absolutely hold his own, but we are husband and wife...shouldn't we be together on all family things, or is it ok for me to do my own thing every once in a while? I dunno. \n\nAnd we wouldn't be going to the park on a different day because the rates would be higher, and we would have to pay for food or whatever (if we chose to eat there) whereas the work event gets us/me in at a discount rate and free food vouchers.. \n\nThanks for your comment, I understand the difficulty in judging as there's a lot of nuance in real life but I appreciate your challenging questions.", "Lol I know right. They like to keep in contact, which I do admire since I grew up in a family that was pretty disconnected from extended family. It's a lot to get used to, having a large family lol", "INFO: do you see your husband's immediate family on a regular basis? Does the family reunion include some very elderly members that you and DH really should see and pay respect to (because you can't see them otherwise?).\n\nHonestly if it's just an excuse to get people together who share a last name, yeah nope, I wouldn't worry about it. Your husband is on board with splitting duties and he's a big boy who can take care of representing the both of you - heck, even Megan and Harry are doing that. FOR A KING'S CORONATION.\n\nNTA.", "NTA for wanting to go. Admittedly, an amusement park sounds more fun and as long as your husband is ok I wouldn't see an issue. It sounds though that if your husbands family knew the reason you're not there, that might cause some tension, so perhaps if you do go, either tell your FIL you have a prior commitment and nothing more, and/or make sure your husband agrees to say that you're just busy, sick, whatever.", "Unless someone dies between family reunions. Then that would have been your last chance to see them.", "Yes! Sending something special is a great idea! Do you have a signature dish?", "As a fellow empath, I completely understand!! Weird question, but may I ask how old you are-ish?", "Sometimes it is just easier to flip a coin... lol\n\nI hope you have a fun day wherever you decide to go!", "Hahah! I didn't know that about Megan and Henry! That's kind of amusing, actually lol... We see immediate family several times a year on top of holidays. We do see his mom's side more often than his dad's side, though. There isn't anyone who comes to mind who would be there that we wouldn't see at holidays. Honestly, the last time I went, we mainly hung out with the people we knew anyway. We did a round of introductions, and then hung out in our own pocket of the reunion.", "Heh, I am still trying to \"solidify my reputation\" for being a good cook and baker. FIL  really likes a kind of cookie that I make for him, but I don't think he wants to share those \ud83e\udd23 I will have to find something, do you have any suggestions for a dish to bringm", "No worries! I meant to include in the body because I think I'm supposed to do that kind of thing lol but I am 28, my husband is the same age \u263a\ufe0f", "My go to is donut bread pudding. https://www.theseoldcookbooks.com/leftover-donut-bread-pudding/", "It's cool! I asked because there seems to be a common occurrence of getting to your thirties and suddenly having far less fucks to give.
