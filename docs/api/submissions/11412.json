That is such a dumb move, I hope she realizes she\u2019s being manipulated. I hope she realizes before it\u2019s too late to go back to school and escape.

However, more concerning is what you didn\u2019t say but only hinted at. \u2018Some arguments\u2019 and perhaps a young person dominated emotionally by an older one.  It seems your perception of the relationship is that it is unequal and that the 22 yo is being manipulated and abused emotionally.

Apparently she cheated on him. But considering all the talk of marriage and babies I would see him do... Even though he claimed she'd initiate those conversations, I doubted it considering she liked TikTok thirst traps a lot... I wonder if she was trying to figure out a way to leave him without him going a little crazy on her. Considering his normal attitude, I wouldn't want to date someone so damn fight happy. Hell, just recently I made a comment about an issue we're having with one specific delivery driver who'll deliver stuff and not knock, so it gets ruined in the weather.

Having your whole identity wrapped up in your partner os unhealthy. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not ok-the 22 year old gave her identity to your sister. That needed to be said. Too bad she didn\u2019t apparently listen. And if you would have felt the same about a brother, then you know it\u2019s unbiased towards sex.", "you're literally agreeing with that comment. they said this subreddit DOES care about older men dating younger women.", "Ah I see, pregnancy is the line.

She's only ever known an abusive relationship from her teens and a short lived fling where she was the cheating partner of a guy who had a pregnant fiancee.\n\nMost people who seek out relationships with that big of an age gap are damaged and/or abusers.

It is unthinkable to me at my age to date someone who is college aged. There is no way for it not to be predatory. You were completely NTA. Also, I am sure the group chat between her close friends is going absolutely bonkers over this. They are 100% calling her Leo now.", "Age gaps themselves are not an issue when both parties are of age and adults.

Two entirely different periods of life.\n22-26 is probably one and up to 30? Then to 35? That's probably getting closer to the same life stage as late forties. \nThere's so many life changes you don't realize until you've lived through them and realized how different you are. Well... Should be. I know some people stagnate.", "Would you still be saying if it was a 47 year old man dating a 22 year old girl?

Meaning a 35 that goes under 25 is a dumbass who doesn't know how to talk/relate or just wants to abuse people(LeoDicap included).", "No one should stive to have Leo's relationship mentality... Plenty of celebs that have healthy ones, they are often more attractive than him to boot.", "That\u2019s the point.

Gotcha!", "That is the dumbest and most untrue thing I have ever fucking heard, get real", "I've rarely seen it put this way. Yikes. Married to someone when your current so was literally a toddler. The ages make a difference.

If you are, you definitely haven\u2019t had much exposure to others who are. We\u2019re less than 5%(10% when you combine gay and lesbian but splitting that in half..) Options are limited and a lot of the power balance stuff I\u2019ve noticed with straight couples is less pronounced when same sex.\n\nWhile I\u2019d, personally, prefer someone near my age, I\u2019m not gonna overreact to those in an adult consensual relationship that are not. Unless OP has seen some sign it\u2019s not, I don\u2019t get the outrage.", "Dodging the question twice, nice. Or playing dumb lol.", "What part of the above comment is confusing to you? Seems really obvious and straight forward to me.", "No problem. My bad for the harshness, been groomed before, it's rough. Not all 20 somethings realize what they're getting into with these people double their age. Best thing for OP to do is keep an eye on the girl", "No, you were right, and I should know better. I'm pretty ashamed of myself. Thanks for clearing that up. I hope I keep that energy, tomorrow. Lol.", "This. Here\u2019s my opinion:\n\nI\u2019ve always been the age gap police. Mostly if the younger is below 25. But now I\u2019m in an age gap relationship where I\u2019m the older one. It took 3 months of decision making, getting perspectives from loved ones, perspective from my therapist, and a lot of conversations with my partner. So my opinion has someone changed. There\u2019s a couple sides to this: \n\n1.) the experiences of both parties and the recognition of complications within an age gap relationship\n2.) mental health status (this young girl making her whole identity about her girlfriend is a sign of not quite being in a good place, mentally)\n3.) intentions. Grooming? Or maybe it really is something that will be healthy and work out.\n4.) (the biggest), habit. Leonardo DiCaprio making it a habit to date really young girls is a red flag. But someone who consistently dates in their age range and then happens to find someone younger they connect with? Not inherently a red flag. \n\nOP has a good perspective, it\u2019s not just the age gap. It\u2019s the behavior within the relationship."]}
