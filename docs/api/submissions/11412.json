There\u2019s a couple sides to this: \n\n1.) the experiences of both parties and the recognition of complications within an age gap relationship\n2.) mental health status (this young girl making her whole identity about her girlfriend is a sign of not quite being in a good place, mentally)\n3.) intentions. Grooming? Or maybe it really is something that will be healthy and work out.\n4.) (the biggest), habit. Leonardo DiCaprio making it a habit to date really young girls is a red flag. But someone who consistently dates in their age range and then happens to find someone younger they connect with?

She didn't tell her sister, she told the gf. Since there is no big issue like abuse or cheating I don't think it was OP place to speak to gf. They could talk to sister. That smells like jealousy/ entitlement to me", "The quitting school thing is probably worse than the age difference in my opinion possibly throwing your future prospects away for a partner is a huge deal.", "all I can think that is OPs sister was 25 becoming an adult when the new girl was walking around in diapers", "You're NTA, OP. \n\nReddit got up and arms whenever Leo (48) dates young women.

However, you gotta keep in mind that GF apparently dropped out of school to be with OP's sister, and that's concerning. \n\nWe don't know the full length of the story so it might be that sister encouraged gf to follow the career path she truly wanted if the program she dropped out wasn't her passion, but again, we don't know if this is the case, we can only judge based on what we're told, and if it's true that gf left school just because sister told her to... Then idk man but this does seem like a red flag to me. \n\nI fully believe that for people to have a healthy relationship they should be independent from one another, that being mentally or financially, and to encourage a woman to drop out of school just isn't sitting right with me. But then again, that's only my opinion so it really doesn't matter and it's completely fine if people don't tend to agree on something, specially if that something is controversial.", "Hey OP, I'm a lesbian who got married to someone 35 when I was 19\n\nI tried to justify it in so many ways. The usual age gap ones- I'm just so mature, they get me in a way no one else does. But there are also some gay-specific ones. That an age gap is normal, that women can't be predatory so it must be safe.
