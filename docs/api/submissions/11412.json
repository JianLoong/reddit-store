There\u2019s a couple sides to this: \n\n1.) the experiences of both parties and the recognition of complications within an age gap relationship\n2.) mental health status (this young girl making her whole identity about her girlfriend is a sign of not quite being in a good place, mentally)\n3.) intentions. Grooming? Or maybe it really is something that will be healthy and work out.\n4.) (the biggest), habit. Leonardo DiCaprio making it a habit to date really young girls is a red flag. But someone who consistently dates in their age range and then happens to find someone younger they connect with?
