That is a creepy as fuck age difference, the gender is irrelevant. Your sister is being a creep and I hope her girlfriend realizes it and gets out of it.", "NTA. The dynamic is creepy and someone needs to look out for that young woman.", "ESH\n\nI don't think you're wrong, but it's also not your situation to change or control. Drunkenly yelling at people about their life choices is always a poor move.", "ESH that's definitely in \"gross\" territory as far as age gaps go but it's not really your business either", "You're not wrong, but unfortunately YTA for how you went about it\n\nAt the end of the day, their relationships are none of your business", "YTA. I mean both are well aware of the age difference. I can't see any reason to say anything as if it was news or a potential issue they are unaware of.", "YTA \n\nYour sister and her girlfriend are adults and can do what they like. Even if they\u2019re awful for each other, other people have the right to make their own mistakes.", "YTA. The girlfriend is an adult. Do I think it's ill advised, and that the gf is making a colossal mistake? Absolutely. But, at the end of the day, the gf has the right to make it.", "ESH. The whole situation is out of everyones control. My suggestion is to stop back and let the two figure out the relationship for themselves.", "NTA, this is some creepy mid life crisis shit", "YTA. Y\u2019ll need to get over age gap relationships that involve consenting adults. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re two males, two females, or a male and a female; nor who is younger or older.\n\nEdit: spelling.", "YTA.  (It's borderline for E S H but there isn't enough info about sis or gf.  It may be a case of each taking advantage of the other and they may deserve each other in all the wrong ways.)\n\nYou should have quietly had a one-time conversation with your sister's gf and said something like, \"Hey, sis is awesome and you're awesome, but the two of you are at very different stages of life.  I'm worried that imbalance is creating a lot of problems between you two.  It's not something that can't be overcome, but it is something you really need to keep in mind to have a healthy relationship.\"  After that, you back off unless there are signs of abuse.", "YTA - Someone else's romantic relationship is really none of your business. When it comes to family it just adds a whole other layer of complications on top of that.\n\nWhile it is true that it's a very large age gap, and that just adds another barrier to their relationship, that doesn't give you the right to intervene.\n\nUnless those arguments become physical, I'd just remove myself from the situation if I were you. If they are getting physically abusive to one or the other, or both, then it's time to try and separate them.", "YTA, mind your business.  Your jealousy is showing", "ESH\n\nThe rule for age gaps, because of the huge power imbalance is half the oldest\u2019s age plus 7. Your sister should not be dating anyone under 30 at the age of 47. \n\nThis young woman quit school for your predator sister. That is such a dumb move, I hope she realizes she\u2019s being manipulated. I hope she realizes before it\u2019s too late to go back to school and escape. They are already arguing in front of other people, this is a toxic and statistically likely abusive relationship. \n\nBut you\u2019re not the person to give this poor girl a reality check. She\u2019s now less likely to leave on her own. It wasn\u2019t your place. You should have simply said \u201cI don\u2019t support this relationship so I\u2019m not coming around.\u201d", "Very soft YTA.  They are both adults, and while 22 is young it isn\u2019t 18.  Still raises some concern though.  However, more concerning is what you didn\u2019t say but only hinted at. \u2018Some arguments\u2019 and perhaps a young person dominated emotionally by an older one.  It seems your perception of the relationship is that it is unequal and that the 22 yo is being manipulated and abused emotionally. If this is an abusive relationship then you would not be the AH and should speak up.  But you present little to no evidence that the 22 to is being abused, just that the relationship is contentious.  If that is the case that is why I said Y T A.", "NTA, hello police? This person's sister right here. Smh going after a 20 year old when you're pushing 50. That's a whole child", "That\u2019s just it, Is there a difference if they are the same gender? Because if my sister was my \u201cbrother\u201d I would have the same concerns.", "I think the age gap is gross but I still think OP is the AH. They\u2019re both consenting adults, it\u2019s not up to her to be in their business. It\u2019s especially not right to get wasted and berate them. YTA.", "Fuck off with your \"if the genders were reversed\", arguement. If the roles were reversed, It'd be a 22 year old man, with a 47 year old man. It'd be a clear sugar baby/ daddy relationship, and no one would say shit, unless it became abusive. The only reason the straights are subjected to this, is because babies can be made by sex. Same sex couples can't accidentally make a baby by a drunk Friday night full of fun debauchery with each other.", "Not everyone can be Leonardo DiCaprio...", "What are you talking about? I constantly see people going on about age gaps as little as eight years for older men dating younger women.", "A 22 year old woman can get pregnant by a 47 year old man. A 22 year old woman and a 48 year old woman, can't get pregnant. It's not double standards,  it's different circumstances.", "If the sister was a brother yall would not be saying this", "If this was a 47 year old man you'd be saying the opposite and you know it", "But Emotional and Psychological abuse can be very harmful as well.", "Haha my jealousy. You are definitely not a mom lol", "Being encouraged to drop out of school by a much older partner looks like abuse to me\u2026", "Absolutely no difference in gender whatsoever. My uncle is like this, he will regularly try to date women that are my age or younger but still legal, and I'm 21. I've told him I find it gross. Hell his last \"girlfriend\" was 19, and in DoC. Apparently she cheated on him. But considering all the talk of marriage and babies I would see him do... Even though he claimed she'd initiate those conversations, I doubted it considering she liked TikTok thirst traps a lot... I wonder if she was trying to figure out a way to leave him without him going a little crazy on her. Considering his normal attitude, I wouldn't want to date someone so damn fight happy. Hell, just recently I made a comment about an issue we're having with one specific delivery driver who'll deliver stuff and not knock, so it gets ruined in the weather. I mentioned making a sign and he was like \"Or how about tomorrow I come over and stand and wait and kick this guy's fucking ass.\"\n\nIt's a goddamn delivery driver, like for goodness sake!", "No difference in gender as far as things like this go. A big age gap is fine if both are comfortable with it and it\u2019s a healthy relationship. Heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual-these in and of itself applies the same-a healthy relationship. Having your whole identity wrapped up in your partner os unhealthy. That\u2019s why it\u2019s not ok-the 22 year old gave her identity to your sister. That needed to be said. Too bad she didn\u2019t apparently listen. And if you would have felt the same about a brother, then you know it\u2019s unbiased towards sex.", "you're literally agreeing with that comment. they said this subreddit DOES care about older men dating younger women.", "Ah I see, pregnancy is the line. Of course. \n\nLesbians can\u2019t have sex resulting in children thus making age gaps perfectly okay. I had no idea that was the case. \n\nThat was sarcasm, by the way.", "Pregnancy should not be the line. Taking advantage of someone twice your age should be. Apparently if a 20 year old girl is infertile she can be groomed by old men all she wants. Smh I didn't expect less from reddit, always having awful morals. Grandma shouldn't be messing with someone old enough to be her daughter", "Not sure where that is coming from.", "Huh?", "OK you got me there. Just remove the word Physical. If abuse is happening then yes, maybe it's time to step in. But I would be hyper aware of the consequences of such an action. Also the possibility that your help is unwanted. Not everyone is willing to accept truth.", "Your sister is also your daughter,  kinda fked up", "You know what? That's fair. I didn't think of it that way. This is why I'm always here, different perspectives from people who can explain things in a way I can understand. Thanks! \nNo sarcasm."]}
