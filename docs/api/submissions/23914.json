My husband, then fianc\u00e9, and I never wanted a big wedding. We\u2019re very happy with something small and then have a big honeymoon.\n\nBecause of this we decided that we would get married in Hawaii and have a reception with friends and family when we get back. (We were engaged for a year to give people time to save money and plan time off. Covid was starting to become serious a month or two before our wedding and the state shut down the week after we got married.) \n\nBecause it was small we decided that it would be my parents and his parents in attendance. My sisters didn\u2019t come and neither did his brother. \n\nMy husbands parents are divorced and don\u2019t get along. My husbands dad remarried and he was bringing his new wife. MIL heard this and said she wanted to bring a date a month before our wedding. I told her she could bring a date to the island, but I didn\u2019t want a stranger to my wedding. We didn\u2019t know she was dating anyone and I didn\u2019t want a stranger in our photos that ten years from now we have no idea what their name was. She argued that FIL was bringing a date to the wedding. I told her that FIL was bringing his wife of six years a woman that my husband and I have known for years at this point.\n\nShe became angry with me. I explained to her that if she brought a date then they could meet us for dinner after the wedding and we could do activities together before and after the wedding. She said \u201cit\u2019s really rude to invite someone to a wedding then tell them they can\u2019t go to the ceremony.\u201d\n\nI told her that I wasn\u2019t inviting them she was. (This is where I might be the Ahole) she told me \u201ccareful OP if you\u2019re not nice to me then I won\u2019t come to the wedding\u201d I don\u2019t do the emotional manipulation bull. I told her \u201cokay then don\u2019t come, did you think that effected me? You\u2019re disappointing your son not me.\u201d She cried, \u201cit\u2019s your fault I\u2019m crying\u201d I looked her dead in the eye void of any emotion and told her \u201cit\u2019s not my fault that you\u2019re sensitive.\u201d \n\nShe does this a lot where she\u2019ll cry to get her way and is used to people doing what she says. She did come to the wedding and has not spoken to me since. Which in my opinion is amazing (she\u2019s never been nice to my husband and did some things in his childhood that really messed him up) so am I the Ahole here?", "created_utc": 1691210612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15im558/aitah_for_telling_my_mil_that_she_couldnt_bring_a/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Should have been your fiancee (now husband).", "INFO: have you ever met the date? Or heard about them before this?", "NTA. We know it was only in reaction to learning that her ex was bringing his wife since she didn't ask about plus ones when she was originally invited. Who waits until a month before a wedding to request an extra invitation? And she was definitely trying to manipulate you by threatening not to come.", "NTA guests lists are entirely up to the couple. If you don't want some random stranger there you don't need them there. My MIL pulled some \"maybe I won't come to the wedding\" shit and I'm still not entirely over it.

If it didn't, it's just plain rude to even try and bring another person, especially one that the wedding couple doesn't know.", "NTA - But I really think your response was based more on a lot of frustration with your MIL\u2019s past behavior towards your husband.

It doesn't sound like there was a big ceremony and reception, so not sure how many formal photos would have been taken.  She probably wanted someone there for emotional support. Maybe he was her friend or she could have been dating this guy for a while and just didn't advertise it.

TBH I used to work in a prison and I\u2019m used to confrontation, it was my job to confront bad behavior.

I do have a tendency to have quick come back and didn\u2019t appreciate her trying to manipulate the situation into her favor as she often does. That\u2019s why I believe I might have been the Ahole. I\u2019m protective over the people I love and how she has hurt my husband does upset me. At one point my husband was questioning having his mother attend due to some other behavior. But I don\u2019t disagree with what you\u2019re saying", "I don\u2019t get how her FIL bringing his wife of 6 years is the same as her MILs bf of a few months. Why did she need moral support to her own child\u2019s wedding?", "I can see how you would feel that way. When we planned the trip Covid wasn\u2019t a thing yet. The seriousness of it didn\u2019t begin until after my wedding. People were still figuring out how dangerous Covid was and there was no plan on how to combat the illness. No masks were required, all businesses were open as normal. It wasn\u2019t until after my wedding that states began to shut down and businesses began to close", "We need this story.", "Yeah she\u2019s just using her emotional tactics to get her way and is now throwing a fit because it didn\u2019t work this time lol", "So why was she invited?", "I teach in a correctional facility.", "Sometimes you have to be TA to get your point across or to let people know you're not going to put up with the bs. She had her options, and she could either accept them or stay home to play the victim.", "Human nature.\n\nWhen you divorce someone, you have children together, there is no escaping your ex.  It\u2019s really normal to feel like you want your ex to see how well you are doing.  FIL has been married for 6 years and MIL is still alone.  Being at the wedding alone, without an escort would be very embarrassing for MIL.  Some people would be fine with it, but this MIL isn\u2019t.  No one wants to look like a loser in front of their ex.", "Do I post that here in the comments? It\u2019s a long story", "I was a female CO in a male facility.", "I\u2019ve seen people post things to their profiles, so that\u2019s a thing, but I don\u2019t know how to do it. But I\u2019d love to hear the story!", "I guess I\u2019ll post it here? Well about a year ago my MIL out of the blue said she was going to take a visit to Scotland. She went in October to meet a man she had been talking to online with.\n\nShe stayed with him for about a week and said she was in love. She had been talking to him online for about six to seven months before meeting him.\n\nSince this was the \u201clove of her life\u201d\u2026 again. She decided to move to Scotland. She was granted a nine month visa, sold her car, got the special paper work for her dog and arranged with her job to work remotely in Scotland.\n\nShe left ten days before Christmas because \u201cshe wanted to start her new life right away\u201d and \u201cthis is the first time she wanted to be selfish and do something for herself\u201d \n\nWe faced timed with her in Christmas and saw the guy for the first time. I\u2019ve worked in prisons and could tell by some things he said that he\u2019s done some time. \n\nI was right he had done time for b&E, theft and stripping copper. She also said he had a substance abuse problem\u2026 all of her boyfriends seem to have a substance abuse problem\u2026\n\nShe broke up with him after six months. Which my husband and I had bets on. He said it would be 3 months and I said 6 because she would gaslight him into staying with her longer. The usual \u201cI gave up everything to be with you.\u201d \n\nAfter they broke up she continued to live with him. More gaslighting of it being their fault that they broke up and she had nowhere to go and it would be an Ahole move. \n\nWhen her visa was close to expiring she received a call from scottland immigration. They informed her that her visa was ending and she needed to leave by a certain date or she would be deported. And charges would be pressed.\n\nFound out later he\u2019s the one that called immigration to get her to leave. She was scrambling last minute to get back and left one day before her deadline. I guess she was trying to get sponsored, but no dice.", "Wow. That's impressive on so many, many levels.\n\nAlso makes it even clearer why you said no to the date.", "NTA\n\nHer beef with her ex and his wife has no business at your wedding.", "NTA.  You handled your MIL perfectly!    Good job OP?", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s pretty cruel to have her go to an intimate gathering with her ex and his new love and make her be alone.\n\nJust let her have the plus one. As for the pics they are a snapshot of time, of the moment as it was.", "NTA\n\nYou handled her fairly and her demands with the response they warranted.", "Honestly, when she threatened not to come would have been the revocation of her invite. \n\nLady sounds manipulative as hell", "The ex boyfriend needs to write a post for petty revenge.  ::slow clapping::   <\u2014- do people still do that?", "NTA. She just wanted her ex to see her moving on. It\u2019s a completely understandable moment to want to have, but she was a crazy brat in trying to get it. There would have been plenty enough opportunity to have he  ex see her with her boyfriend if she wanted that moment so badly. Sadly, I bet they\u2019re not even together anymore are they smh"]}
