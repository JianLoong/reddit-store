You're the victim of his unfaithfulness. NOT him.\n\nHe's done this twice. You don't think he will change but you don't want to be a single mom.

Which I'm not holding my breath for. \n\nYou deserve better, OP.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve been fuming about this situation. He also cheated on you after you had his child!! The nerve!!", "NTA.

I\u2019m not gonna tell you you have to leave\u2026 but old habits hardly die. So, there\u2019s not really a right way to go about this. Either tell him sorry for not helping it or tell him you don\u2019t want to help make some thing that hurt you so bad better. And that this is what comes with those type of decisions. Tell him that he has to live with himself and the criticism because he already did what he did", "NTA - He wants you to isolate yourself from people who are the support system that he should be the biggest part of, and for what? His ego?", "NTA\n\nIt's truly awful to have a child with someone who simply refuses to hold up their end of a marriage.

Had you said something like, \"he refused to come because he is afraid of what you will say to him about his cheating\" but say it with an angry and disappointed tone, makes what you say factual and not explicitly judgmental (giving your husband no room to blame you) but your voice leaves no doubt about you judging your husband badly.  Your family will understand how you really feel from your voice alone.", "NTA. What in the world are you worried about HIS feelings for?!?\n\nHe chose to completely avoid a major holiday with your family and left you to do it alone, because he was afraid they\u2019d give him crap, which, 1. He deserves and 2. You say they\u2019d never do, and he likely knows.\n\nSo you explain his absence by saying basically he didn\u2019t want to face them, and he says \u2018 that\u2019s not going to help\u2019.\n\nI cannot believe you\u2019re here asking if you did anything wrong.\n\nHe\u2019s got a live one in you.\n\nHe cheats multiple times, bags on a major holiday, and gripes at you.\n\nWhy in all of this world did you have a baby with this man?\n\nHe\u2019s obviously a through and though asshole for life.\n\nI don\u2019t understand women like you I\u2019m sorry to say.", "Serious question: How many times is he allowed to cheat on you before you would decide that you're better off without him? One more time? Twice more? Whatever that number is, you know damn well he's going to get there eventually.

But you\u2019re going to be more exhausted trying to maintain a relationship that just isn\u2019t working. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "NTA actions have consequences.

Your daughter growing up to think that his behaviour should be accepted and is normal. Trust me, she will grow up picking the same kind of man. \nI honestly get it, my SO left me when I was pregnant with my our 2nd for a much younger woman, yes we worked through it but in hindsight I wouldn't do it again. \nIt will be hard but you deserve someone that is 100% with you and your daughter. You also seem to have family around for support which I lack. Good luck!", "Nta. At worse, your word choice could have been \u201cbetter\u201d as the it possible some may find the term an insult, but I don\u2019t believe you\u2019re a NTA bc you wouldn\u2019t lie for your husband. \n\nHe made choices and there are consequences for those choices.", ">I told them he is a chicken. \n\nHe is much, much more than that. NTA.", "NTA - in fact, good on you. Too many people, and especially too many women, spend their time covering up for their partners\u2019 bad behaviour. Not surprisingly, that doesn\u2019t make it stop. If he didn\u2019t want your family to know he\u2019s a cheat and a coward, there was an easy way to achieve that.\n\nI find one aspect of this particularly interesting. Often when we conceal a partner\u2019s bad behaviour it\u2019s because we know we should leave them but we know we\u2019re not ready to, and we don\u2019t want the pressure of other people also knowing we should. It doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case at all with you, though, and I wonder if you\u2019re more ready than you think to leave him. There won\u2019t be a time when that prospect isn\u2019t exhausting, but you\u2019re exhausted anyway. It sounds like your family is close and supportive, too. No one can tell you what to do, but as other people in this thread have said, people who cheat rarely change and it sounds like you pretty much know that too", "NTA\n\nHe is chicken.

I hope you will find some self respect , not only for you but also for this poor child.", "NTA, he was a chicken, last Christmas my sister\u2019s cheating ex came for Christmas dinner with us. We were civil to him and we are on ok terms with him now.", "He is the asshole obviohsly", "NTA. If for no other reason than if your husband isn't going to be around to support you, then you are going to have to rely on your family and, if they are going to be your primary support system, they have to know what is going on.\n\nAs far as being worried about hurting his feelings: it seems like he hasn't been worried much about worried about your feelings, so he doesn't have much call to complain about your behavior. \n\nThe pattern is more than just infidelity - it is selfishness. If that is the case, then don't let your husband off the hook - make certain that he helps out with the baby - do not let him slack off on his share of taking care of the baby.", "NTA-\n\nOnce a cheater always a cheater,he\u2019s probably cheated more than twice or if he hasn\u2019t he will,is there any family you can move in with until you can find your own place and until your mental health gets better?\n\nI promise you he is not sorry and he will do it again and again,that\u2019s what cheaters do.

He needs to manage his feelings himself. THis is taking responsibility for his actions. It would be best if you can take some time away to make this decision so that it is made from a practical instead of emotional viewpoint. Best wishes to you.

Lol", "I think being a single mother would be better than staying in a relationship where the husband has no respect or love (you don\u2019t cheat on someone you love!) for his wife. Such an existence would be soul and self esteem destroying. NTA but be kinder to yourself staying with this \u2026man, is not going to be good for YOU.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong.
