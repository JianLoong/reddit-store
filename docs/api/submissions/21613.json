Apparently this happened multiple times in the last two weeks where you said the opposite of what she said, so you should let the kids know mom has the final say and going to you for a different answer isn\u2019t acceptable.

You still need to understand that you spent years training her kids and now need to work hard to both support your wife, and re-train the kids.  Learn the words \"What did mommy say?\" or \"Did you ask your mother?\".

For a while, you had been overruling what your now-wife said while you were just dating, and the kids got it in their minds that if Mom says one thing not in their favor, you\u2019ll tell them the opposite, thus making it partially your fault they don\u2019t listen to her. But you do make a valid point that if you don\u2019t know they\u2019d already asked her and she said yes/no, it\u2019s not on you/you overruling her.

This is an easy fix. Whenever they ask you for something, just ask if they also asked mommy... \"what does mommy think?\" Your wife also should be asking, \"what does daddy (or whatever they call you) think?\" There's a reason why the saying includes \"everyone on the same page...\"", "YTA, effective communication from both of you aren't happening. Why dont you ask the kids \"did you ask mom?  What did she say? \" and vice versa?\n\nYou both have effectively taught the kids to ask the other parent when they dont get the answer they want. When you start being on the same page or holding them responsible for telling you he truth of what the other parent says theyll stop doing the ask til i get what i want thing.", "YTA - you and your wife need to TALK to each other.

For every question they ask you, you should be responding \"Let's ask your mom.\"  It is 100% your fault that you don't know if she's said yes or no.  \n\nAnd you need to start paying more attention to what's going on around you.  If your stepson literally asked your wife for a popsicle and she told him no WHILE YOU WERE IN THE SAME ROOM, you should have been aware of that.\n\nYou're going to be completely raked over the coals for your willful ignorance and refusal to be responsible.  And the most frustrating part, it would take such little effort on your part and this entire issue would not exist.", "YTA. If the kids ask you? Just ask her what she wants to happen. The fact is? The kids have noticed that you have overruled her in the past and that is exactly why they are coming to you to ask for things. They are playing you off on each other and you are enabling it. No, it doesn\u2019t matter what age the kids are\u2026 I remember being very young playing my own parents off each other by doing this. One said no? I\u2019d ask the other. Or? I\u2019d go to the one I knew would say yes and not bother asking the one I had a feeling would say no. Me and my siblings all did this.

Or take two seconds and ask your wife. \n\nIt should feel pretty good when you guys get unified and in sync. The kids won\u2019t be manipulative and will probably stop testing you.

How hard is it to say \"Let me check with Mom\"? \n\nMy husband undermined me ever since our kids were little, despite pleading, family counseling, and threats to leave. Now we have 2 adult daughters with zero respect for me. One speaks to him but told me she never wanted to see or hear from me again as long as I live. He gives her money without asking me. Our other daughter still goes to him for money and permissions (she lives with us) behind my back. He did this again yesterday, because he is incapable of saying those 5 little words. Sometimes I get so angry I could scream, and I'm bitter about our daughters. \n\nPlease get it through your head that parents have to work as a team.", "YTA. You make no apology but excuses when you overstep: \u201c I didn\u2019t hear you say that\u201d. Show your wife some respect and back her up. Ask the kids if they have asked their mother for permission before you make decisions that may overrule hers.", "YTA. I\u2019m confused why you posted. In a comment you acknowledge she includes you in decisions but you do not include her because you feel you should have final say. You indicate you\u2019re working on this in therapy because you know it\u2019s wrong and causing issues. \n\nSo basically your post is that the natural consequences of your actions, which you know are wrong and are trying to stop, are driving your wife up the wall. You want to know if you\u2019re an AH. You\u2019ve already acknowledged your behavior is wrong. To the extent you\u2019re receiving therapy.

The first time a BF overruled a parental decision regarding MY children would have been his last. \n\nBottom line, you set her up for failure by constantly undermining her authority. Kids are sponges. Why would they respect her when you obviously don\u2019t?

If they respond that they did ask her and got an answer your response should be that's your answer and why are you asking me. If they haven't asked her, you either need to give them an answer and your wife has to back you up or you should ask her opinion before you answer. \n\nYou should be wise to the children's' tactics to get what they want and shouldn't allow them to play you off of one another.
