Our dog is very friendly and, while he is well behaved and doesn\u2019t jump, he will go up to strangers and greet them.\n\nThis was apparently a problem for one of the families next to us. The mother came up to me and told me her daughter had a paralyzing fear of dogs and asked us to move farther down the beach. I looked past her to see a girl who was maybe ten years old cowering behind a foldable chair, even though my dog was at least fifty feet away from her.\n\nI told her no. I have two small children and I knew it would be a pain to pack everything up and corral them and the dog to the next spot.

I had a dog that was VERY well-behaved off-leash and would not approach others, so when allowed, I would let her off-leash, but my very friendly, non-jumping but very affectionate-to-everyone lab did not come off-leash. Off-leash does not mean they can do whatever they want as long as they don\u2019t bite or jump. You didn\u2019t have to move, but you also didn\u2019t have to be a jerk about it.

I understand that it\u2019s an off leash park that perhaps they knew in advance, perhaps they have adequate days off, knowledge to go elsewhere. \n\nBut here\u2019s the reason I\u2019m commenting: as someone who is not \u2018yay dog\u2019, many out and about dog owners are often very entitled and their dogs are often awful. Im in my mid 40s and have worked hard to be comfortable walking at parks without thinking I would need to kill or incapacitate any dog and usually having a plan and keys or something at hand for the project. As a kid I had several run ins with bad dogs, and they are formative. This is bias, but this kid is going to grow up like me and you confirmed their prejudices and made them more solidly anti dog.

Dogs may be allowed off leash, but that doesn't mean that you couldn't meet her partway. She was trying to protect her daughter and you were more concerned with \"standing your ground\" than offering to leash your dog, move farther away, or promise to better control the dog. In addition, instead of just calmly being nice to the woman and finding middle ground, you offered her a non-solution that was unrealistic and not helpful: \" I suggested that if her child had such a bad fear of dogs, they should avoid public areas that allow dogs\u2013there\u2019s plenty of beaches in the area that either require dogs to be leashed or don\u2019t allow them at all.\" Just because you are not breaking any rules, doesn't mean you aren't also the asshole.", "YTA. Just because dogs are allowed offleash on the beach, it doesn't mean they don't have to be under control. It is rude and potentially dangerous to let your dog just go up to people.

What if someone came up with a kid who kept harassing your dog, would you think this is ok in a public space?\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the lady and her kid will get over this - but your attitude is assholish, and your dog should either be leashed or able to listen to commands  in a public space.", "NTA.\n\n*\"if her child had such a bad fear of dogs, they should avoid public areas that allow dogs\"*\n\nExactly.", "YTA - dog friendly does not mean your dog should run around unleashes and bothering people.", "NTA.

The beach allows off leash dogs, as OP stated. \n\n\nIf the woman wants to watch out for her daughter she could have gone to a beach that doesn't allow dogs at all.

I think the only reason the child felt the dog was too close because the kid has a fear of dogs. I don\u2019t think the dogs gone up to the child because OP stated there was about 50 feet distance, I think the child was just triggered by a dog being in the vicinity. \n\nI don\u2019t think it really matters if they were there first or not. I think the average person wouldn\u2019t feel being 50 feet away is too close for comfort, and if they had that issue they could have simply moved further away themselves and taken her child out of the uncomfortable situation. The mom really sucks for taking her child to a place where it allows dogs off the leash knowing her kid has a paralysing fear of dogs.\n\nIt\u2019s on the mother to ensure her child feels safe, that\u2019s her responsibility not OPs. It wasn\u2019t really feasible for OP to move as they were on their own with two young children and a dog, so it would\u2019ve been incredibly difficult for them to move. It would\u2019ve made more logical sense for the mother and daughter to move themselves, since they were uncomfortable with the distance between them and the dog and it would\u2019ve taken the daughter straight out of the uncomfortable situation rather than relying on someone else to accommodate them. \n\nThe mother really does suck though, because if the child was really that fearful of dogs then you wouldn\u2019t take them to a beach where it\u2019s likely they will be with the vicinity of a dog. She\u2019s just setting her daughter up for the possibility of feeling scared and uncomfortable.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s really wrong for them to have a laugh about the entitled mother. She wasn\u2019t laughing at the child, if she was then that\u2019s a different story. She explained it wasn\u2019t feasible for her to move, and the woman called her rude when she could have just said ok and simply moved further along herself. OP made a fair comment after being called rude for not accommodating someone else\u2019s child even though she explained why she couldn\u2019t and didn\u2019t want to, especially when it\u2019s not her responsibility either.", "If a dog is 50 ft away from someone, that is not going up to someone.

That's poor dog handling. You keep your eye on the dog at all times when they're off leash in a public space.\n\nWhy is this so hard for people to understand? Again, I am saying the dog wandering and \"greeting\" people is an issue. It is not the ONLY issue. Yes, the mother should be more aware of the animal status of the beach she takes her child to if they're fearful of dogs however if OP is taking their dog to a beach and letting it off leash then it needs to be watched and under control which it doesn't sound like it was by OP's information provided.\n\nThis is an ESH.", "Okay so in germany we actually call it dog beaches since out of 100 possible beachsides only like 5 of them allow dogs. \nSo if you have a child that is that scared of dogs that 50ft distance make her  cower in fear, unable to move.\nWhy would you go to a dog beach ? \nNot even one were dogs are required to be leashed but the 1 beach where they can run loose. \nThen SURPRISE dogs are in the off leash dog area.\n\nThis was simply poor planning and entitlement of the mother with the child.\nYou know I'm scared of spiders, I won't go to the spiders in a zoo or pet shop, bc you know im scared.\n\nHer dog didn't harass anyone, she mentioned that her dog might go say hello to others but she didn't say anything about recall etc. .\n\nAll of this being mad about stupid people and their poor planning will end with dogs being allowed nowhere an no place for them to be off leash.", "[deleted]", "\"Roaming, running or playing dog - yes.\"\n\nOkay then what is the boundary that the dog should keep between itself and any random human it encounters?

If that's a problem then you have the rest of the world to play in. \n\nDogs are curious animals and if you go to the place specifically for dogs to go around, play, and engage with the world around them then you might experience a dog coming up to see what you're all about.    \n\nI go to the dog park regularly, you know how often people complain about the dogs at the dog park saying hi?   \nNever, not once, it has never happened. And the reason it has never happened is that normal functioning people understand that if you go to the place set aside to be specially designated for dogs to run around. play, and socialize. Well then you might meet a dog.\n\n> True but not wanting naked people touching you or rubbing up on you is fine.\n\nAnd nude beaches don't normally allow for that, mostly because people who want *that* particular experience go to orgies.
