And it sounds like they didn't since it was only for the expensive bottle THEY ordered. Even if they did it while drunk that was their mistake. You didn't agree to ordering it you were already done. They offered for you to take a sip not saying it was an expensive bottle of that they were splitting its cost then. This bill falls on them.

When we got to the grocery store they wanted to buy alcohol and drinks to mix for about $40. I told them that I won't drink it and more importantly can't (a week before I started taking medication for my mental health - first time that I ever had to take some) and they bought it anyways. They still expected me to pay - I only gave $10 (my 1/3 without the alcohol) and didn't mention the the other $20 and the next day I went home agter breakfast to never talk to them again. They talked behind my back that I didn't pay and they had to pay for me.", "NTA that is way too much money for one swig.", "NTA, they\u2019re not your friends if they\u2019re pulling a stunt like this", "NTA. My friend, I understand the need to try and fit in, but believe me, you need to find a new and better group of friends. Not someone who try to take advantage of you especially in an inebriated state.

They offered it to you and you took a sip from the bottle, you didn\u2019t even get a glass.

If they\u2019re mad, I\u2019d offer to pay like $10-15 though just to let it go since it\u2019s not that big of a deal. (Unless of course, they say your drunk ass chugged it)", "This.

You didnt even want to order that. It\u2019s their problem not yours", "NTA\n\nI don't buy for a second that your friends were \"unaware\" that they ordered a $220 bottle of champagne, nor do buy that they are really friends of yours.  Ask yourself why they were so eager to force you to drink the champagne if they are feigning that they \"didn't know\".  This is nothing more than buyer's remorse on their part and they want you to pay for it.  Refuse and cut ties with them.", "NTA. They offered to give you champagne. You took it. If they wanted money that needed to be communicated before hand.", "Agreed", "These friends have found a way to monetize peer pressure, that's a new low.", "That's why they offered it to you. They needed you to go in on the bottle. Do not pay them. And NTA. Your friends surely are, though. Drunk does not imply one is unintelligent. They thought your brain couldn't do the math.", "NTA. I would be petty though and send them like $3.50 For the sip", "NTA- real friends wouldn\u2019t pressure you to drink after you say no and they definitely wouldn\u2019t try to get you to pay for an equal split when you clear only had a tiny amount.", "NTA and they're not your friends.

You seem to be attempting to bill me for 1/4 of that champagne, which would be Y oz.

You got only a salad while the rest of us each ordered an expensive appetizer, entree, and dessert.

No.\n\nEven though it is drinks same situation applies to OP\u2019s situation.", "I understand the sentiment but 5ml is a ridiculously small amount.

YOu did not order, and they just offered you a taste.", "I read your other post and just to repeat. NTA. If they wanted to split it they shpuld have told you before buying it", "Your friends suck. You didn't want it in the first place. Find new friends. Don't pay.", "I would also want to see the receipt. If you really have a 220 bucks bottle, do you want that everybody fills it with his sobber? And one sib is not 1/4 of the bottle. Except OP took one biiiiig sig or it was a 0,2 liter bottle. \n\nFor me it sound like a scam. And maybe they gave OP some cheap stuff and now he can pay for the expensive stuff? Who knows?
