And it sounds like they didn't since it was only for the expensive bottle THEY ordered. Even if they did it while drunk that was their mistake. You didn't agree to ordering it you were already done. They offered for you to take a sip not saying it was an expensive bottle of that they were splitting its cost then. This bill falls on them.

If they are prepared to pay then I think you should too or you might be TA", "The bottom line is that you shared the bottle 4 ways - not 3, and therefore you are responsible for the quarter of the bill.

They still expected me to pay - I only gave $10 (my 1/3 without the alcohol) and didn't mention the the other $20 and the next day I went home agter breakfast to never talk to them again.
