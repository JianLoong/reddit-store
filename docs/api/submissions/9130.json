Religion is a very personal journey that doesn\u2019t require the pressures of a church.

Some like to take the rules to extreme.  Good luck at church, doesn't sound fun.", "NTA-how the bible has been translated and interpreted has changes drastically over the years, even within denominations. For example, during Tudor England where the big split from the Catholic Church was happening, the bible was not seen as being written literal words of truth, but being written by man, inspired by god, as examples of how to live a godly life-ie words inspired by God to teach, but because it was written by man, it wasn\u2019t infallible. \n\nIn many ways the idea that the bible in infallible is a rather new idea, this last push coming out of the 19th century evangelical movement, and that women couldn\u2019t preach as a reaction to the suffrage movement. During this time many churches fought back against that idea as, if god can talk through an ass, he can talk through a woman just as easily.\n\nYou are young, and I know questioning probably isn\u2019t encouraged by your church, but you shared what was in your heart.\n\nI am of no faith-though I have a background in religious studies, and it\u2019s intersection with women\u2019s studies/history.

So what that means is the version of the Bible you are reading is nothing more than a fairy tale at this point and should be treated as stories for general guidance, not hard and fast rules.\n\n2) By enforcing the rules that women are to be quiet and subservient to men is training you to be quiet and out of the way. Grooming you to be a baby factory and house wife. You're still young and learning. Women are more than capable of being on par with men and many of are technical achievements were created BY women.\n\n3) There is no \"one truth\" to anything, only facts and the interpretation of said fact. You can have all the facts laid out in front of you and different people will come to different truths.\n\n4) By forcing the testimony to be something that directly affects women greatly narrows the scope of possible ways for you to talk. You shared something that was a boost overall and they basically called you a sinner for helping someone acclimate to a new world for them.\n\n5) What does it say about your faith when the Satanic Temple has more respect for you than your own faith? Their commandments can be summed up into one sentence: \"Be respectful to all.\"\n\nAs others have said, your church is more aligned with a cult than an actual religion.", "NTA.\nReligion and sexism, a tale as old as time.", "NTA.  You shared what was in your heart.  To have done otherwise would not have been a testimony.", "Wtf and your church's beliefs are based on a misinterpreted letter to the romans by Paul and are wrong.

There are plenty of ways to do that without losing your Christian faith. However, I can\u2019t guarantee your journey will keep you on your church.\n\nEven if you believe the Bible is the word of God you have to remember the Bible was written by multiple people and then translated by multiple others. You have to remember that Books have been taken in and out of the Bible. Different sects have different amounts of Books. For instance, the Catholic Bible has more books than the KJV. \n\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of translation. There\u2019s a strong argument that one of the most used verses in the Bible to oppose homosexuality actually means something very different when read in the original Hebrew and placed historical context.\n\nYou also have to remember that it\u2019s human nature to prioritize certain things over others based on needs and goals. You\u2019ve likely already heard the accusation that Christians \u201cpick and choose\u201d when it comes to the Bible.\n\nThe truth is even more nuanced, because prioritizing doesn\u2019t just mean choosing some things and ignoring others. It means looking at what\u2019s important and deciding what needs reinforcing.\n\nIf your Church is not only prioritizing verses about submission but deeming it so important that it must be reinforced then you should ask yourself why. Who benefits from this perspective? How much is from the Bible and how much is from your Church\u2019s interpretation?\n\nRemember, faith *should* be questioned. Faith needs to stand up against questions, against accusations. If faith only works when it\u2019s not challenged then it\u2019s not really faith.", "This is religion in the service of patriarchy.

Those aren't subservient roles. I'm Jewish, not Christian, but I'm also always struck by how Christian groups pick and choose from the old testament to fit their agenda-- so they make a huge deal out of old testament lines that are vaguely against homosexuality, for example,  but ignore the lines about not mixing linen and wool, marrying your rapists or your brother's widow, or having multiple wives.  \n\nThere is a middle ground between rejecting the Bible and believing that every single outdated thing it says (say, about paying a dowry in goats when you get married) is correct.  We can be inspired by its teachings and wisdom yet still realize that it is a product of its time,  not an infallible document that can 100% literally dictate our lives today.  For its time,  some of its teachings were progressive,  even, but it was also limited by its times. Even if it was inspired by God,  it seems logical to think it would be filtered through the ideas of the people who wrote it down or tailored to be relevant to the ideas at the time. \n\nSince you are online,  I also encourage you to research the abuses within your church.

I think this perspective - women can only speak about womanly things - is not coming from scripture but from your church leaders as humans.\n\nHumans are fallible. You\u2019re allowed to question this. Because you\u2019re 14, and presumably your parents are also part of the church, you\u2019re also allowed to question privately, in your own heart, and in your private prayers. You don\u2019t have to share your doubts unless you feel it\u2019s safe to do so.", "Girl - KEEP QUESTIONING EVERYTHING!!!!", "The bible says women are not supposed to talk in church?\n\nIn the times when the bible was written, church as we know it today literally didn't exist. A bit of a conundrum.\n\nAh yes, I'm talking New Testament here.", "Lol pretty sure you mean \"mixed textiles\"!!!", "Testicles has got to be the best typo I\u2019ve seen! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "The church did exist when the epistles were written", "Churches are mentioned hundreds of times in the new testament, what are you talking about? It's in first Corinthians 14:34. I'm an atheist so I have no skin in this game but what you're saying is just inaccurate.", "Thanks Phone \ud83d\ude02", "IKR.", "Yeah lol literally lots of them were specifically addressed to various churches!"]}
