From that moment, it was only me and our Dad. Our mother passed away when we were quite young, 15 years ago. \n\n  \n**I\u2019m gonna make it short and simple:** we have a conservative background, and he was always very rebellious. He came out of the closet as homosexual when he was 16, he went to raves and adults clubs, joined a sathanic metal band and he was also a crossdresser on stage. Needless to say our father didn\u2019t approve of that of course. Regardless, and let me be crystal effing clear: we still loved him and supported him. We know he was born that way. I don\u2019t want to say more bad things about him because I want the final decision to be fair and he honestly is not a bad kid.  \n\n\n  \nThree years ago I moved out, to live with my wife Elizabeth (32F). Sadly, my father passed away this September. My wife and I moved to my father\u2019s house after that. Nicolas did come for the funeral service, but he kept a distance from all our family.   \n\n\n  \n**Long-story-short:** Nicolas texted me recently, and he expressed interest in the family heirloom (First time he texted me since the funeral, btw). Our great grandmother\u2019s pearl necklace is a necklace that has made its way through three generations of WOMEN. It was my mother\u2019s and then it was kept by my father, until now. Nicolas told me he was in town for a week and that he was available to meet anywhere or to come home to get it, if that was alright with me. \n\nI said it was not the right moment, and that I would need time to think about it. I thought it was ridiculous. Nicolas clearly doesn't intend to have a daughter. Picture this: Nicolas is quite tall, over 6\u20193 probably, and he looks like he plays rugby, can you imagine him wearing a pearl necklace? Maybe he\u2019s back at his crossdressing phase. \n\nI found the necklace and I gave it to my wife, since her birthday was that week. I texted Nicolas that it was going to be my wife\u2019s necklace now, since I wanted to keep it in my family, and he didn\u2019t reply.  \n**Am I insane for thinking that an heirloom for women should stay in the female side of the family?**  My wife made me believe that when I shared this story with her. Elizabeth thinks I was unnecessarily a capital A a-hole to my brother for ignoring his request. Listen, I\u2019m not that petty. I didn\u2019t do it to be mean, I just want the necklace to stay with my family, someday maybe even give it to my future daughter. **AITA?**", "created_utc": 1671129920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmso18/aita_for_giving_my_family_heirloom_to_my_wife/", "score": 459, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Our mother passed away when we were quite young, 15 years ago. \n\n  \n**I\u2019m gonna make it short and simple:** we have a conservative background, and he was always very rebellious. He came out of the closet as homosexual when he was 16, he went to raves and adults clubs, joined a sathanic metal band and he was also a crossdresser on stage. Needless to say our father didn\u2019t approve of that of course. Regardless, and let me be crystal effing clear: we still loved him and supported him. We know he was born that way. I don\u2019t want to say more bad things about him because I want the final decision to be fair and he honestly is not a bad kid.  \n\n\n  \nThree years ago I moved out, to live with my wife Elizabeth (32F). Sadly, my father passed away this September. My wife and I moved to my father\u2019s house after that. Nicolas did come for the funeral service, but he kept a distance from all our family.   \n\n\n  \n**Long-story-short:** Nicolas texted me recently, and he expressed interest in the family heirloom (First time he texted me since the funeral, btw). Our great grandmother\u2019s pearl necklace is a necklace that has made its way through three generations of WOMEN. It was my mother\u2019s and then it was kept by my father, until now. Nicolas told me he was in town for a week and that he was available to meet anywhere or to come home to get it, if that was alright with me. \n\nI said it was not the right moment, and that I would need time to think about it. I thought it was ridiculous. Nicolas clearly doesn't intend to have a daughter. Picture this: Nicolas is quite tall, over 6\u20193 probably, and he looks like he plays rugby, can you imagine him wearing a pearl necklace? Maybe he\u2019s back at his crossdressing phase. \n\nI found the necklace and I gave it to my wife, since her birthday was that week. I texted Nicolas that it was going to be my wife\u2019s necklace now, since I wanted to keep it in my family, and he didn\u2019t reply.  \n**Am I insane for thinking that an heirloom for women should stay in the female side of the family?**  My wife made me believe that when I shared this story with her. Elizabeth thinks I was unnecessarily a capital A a-hole to my brother for ignoring his request. Listen, I\u2019m not that petty. I didn\u2019t do it to be mean, I just want the necklace to stay with my family, someday maybe even give it to my future daughter. **AITA?**\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
