I have lived alone for the last 3years beforehand. So this was a big step for me. I like my space I had to explain that to my boyfriend when we moved. That there will be days I want to do stuff alone. He understood and I give him the same respect. \n\nFast forward end of February we\u2019ve been living together for 6months almost. I really started to feel at home with my boyfriend until he tells me his friend is coming to stay with us. I ask is it for a few days because that\u2019s fine. Nope the friend let\u2019s call him Bob(34M) Is getting evicted from the place he is currently at with two others. \n\nSo this is red flag time for me now. He said he is a really good friend would do the same for me so he is staying. I got no say in it. Even though I found the flat I am also paying. To live here it\u2019s my place too. If he has asked I would of told him the consequences of this choice but he chose not to ask me. \n\nSo a week or so goes by. He keeps badgering me \u201cwhy am I so miserable it\u2019s your work isn\u2019t it? why you always in the bedroom now.\u201d I snap saying \u201cI don\u2019t feel at home in my own home. You brought your friend without asking me and you\u2019re expecting me to be ok with everything.\u201d \nHe then said that I am creating the problem I\u2019m excluding myself from the lounge. That maybe I\u2019m on the spectrum for how badly I\u2019ve taken this change. Which I know I\u2019m not. I got undiagnosed adhd but I\u2019m not on the spectrum I have enough mates who are that can tell I\u2019m not. \nHe has since apologised for those statements and taken them back. Has understood that he crossed a boundary that I had in place. Said it won\u2019t happen again. \n\nHere is the real kicker. My relative is the building manager of the building we are in. And they like Bob but they also want Bob out due to him not technically being able to stay here. My relative also has a place here rent free under the condition they work and make sure things like what\u2019s happening in my flat doesn\u2019t happen. Because I am the relative it puts them in an awkward position. We also mentioned that if the landlord that if they found out we had him here. We could all get fined and get evicted. Bob knows all this and yet he still hasn\u2019t found anything. Even I have checked spareroom and there are so many rooms available for his price range with bills included. \n\nSo my relative went to Bob today to go over some available properties some of the information has been confusing but there should be something available soon. At the northern part of the city. According to Bob it\u2019s too far away. He hasn\u2019t got a job yet if he does it\u2019s remotely. So I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s too far away. I overheard him loose his temper at my relative. For trying to help. Which is uncalled for he is staying here rent free. \n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting this dude out of my lounge?\n\nEdit sorry if I can\u2019t get back to all of you I really appreciate the comments.", "created_utc": 1680099271, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125pbzn/aitah_for_wanting_my_boyfriends_mate_to_find_his/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To be honest, that would\u2019ve happened the moment he thought he could tell me what to do, period, let alone on something as impactful as a housing arrangement.", "NTA.\n\nKick them both out.\n\nYou pay for it, you make the rules, follow your lease.\n\nEdit:  Even if BF pays his share he is still violating the terms of the lease.", "NTA. Your bf says you have no say at all and now the man won\u2019t leave even when presented with options to do so? He wants to stay with you, rent free. Also I\u2019m not too impressed with your bf", "NTA he doesn't want to leave. He wants to live rent free. I know exactly how you feel. I don't even want family living with me. Ill let them stay for a bit if need be but i want to live alone. He needs to move on. This wasn't permanent, it was temporary. Honestly, if he doesn't want to leave, you should leave them both to deal with each other. This was doomed from the beginning & your bf has no respect for you.", "NTA\n\nSomeone moving in should have required two yesses, not an ultimatum from your BF. Also, it was against your lease terms. Bob needs to be out of there yesterday.\n\nAnd also, you have much bigger problems if your BF thinks it's okay to pull something like this without you being okay with it. Seems like you two may have moved in together too soon...", "NTA - Not only does this guy need to go, he should never have been there in the first place. That's on your BF, who also needs to go. He's a gaslighter and doesn't respect you. You're both in your 30s and old enough to know better. Him saying \"it won't happen again\" is worthless. It will happen again, and next time it might be even worse.\n\nETA: You can tell a lot about people by their friends. Your BF's friend is a lying moocher, and I'll let you decide whether your BF shares those traits.", "NTA!! This is your place and \"Bob\" has places he can go, he just chooses not to and puts your own place to stay at risk of eviction.\n\nGet Bob to leave and tell him to take your partner with him, he doesn't respect your boundaries.", "NTA.  You bf is.  You have every right to control your own living space, and your bf should have got your consent before even inviting Bob to move in.  Had he done that, he'd be aware of the risk to your family's living space, and that makes this far more unacceptable. \n\nThe reasons Bob makes you feel uncomfortable is irrelevant. He does, and that's not ok in your own home.  And although retracted, you're bf's \"on the spectrum\" comment makes no sense.  Even if you were triggered because you were on the spectrum, doesn't mean you should have to keep being triggered. I'm on the spectrum, and my wife would never put me in that kind of situation.  \n\nI think almost everyone at some point knows this story too well. You or someone you know will wind up with a mooch living on their couch and it's always inconvenient, they always overstay their welcome, and it's always a struggle to get rid of them.  Why, because free housing is hard to give up. \n\nI once crashed on a friends couch, who had another \"friend\" on their other couch who'd been there for3 months. My friend who's house it was wanted him out asap, and mooch was completely oblivious.   I said \"I'm looking for a place right now, want to move in with me\". And he said \"nah, I'm good, I like I don't have to pay here\".  That's the attitude you can expect form Bob. Your bf needs to back you up in this so you can get your living space back, and your family won't experience the repercussions.  Start charging Bob rent, as that will give him more of a reason to leave. And give him a firm deadline that he has to be out.", "NTA I would stop paying half the rent. If I get no say in the space I\u2019m not paying. Let your BF know when Bob leaves you will start to pay again until then he is on his own!", "NTA. Kick em both out.", "NTA it's your private space boyfriend should've asked before he brought his friend over. You both share so you both have to be on the same page on this. He can't just do as he pleases as if you're not there.", "NTA. \n\nTo my understanding you had your boyfriend move in to your place and he said to you the equivalent of \"Oh, by the way, my buddy is moving in. You've got no say, so get used to it\". The friend of his has no job, isn't helping pay anything, and got evicted from his last place. A lot of red flags their. \n\nOn top of that, your relative tries talking to this friend to help him with details about places to live and he has the balls to raise his voice with them? Screw this person. He sounds like a low life mooch who just wants hand outs all the time. I've delt with the same kind of people and they never change.\n\nBreak up with your boyfriend (he's bound to do more things like this without asking you at all), kick them both out and be happy living in a more stable, stress free environment.", "NTA \n\nYour bf doesn\u2019t respect you. When you live together, any decision this big must be 2 \u201cyeses\u201d, or its an automatic \u201cno\u201d. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t value your opinion. And is now trying to literally diagnose you with autism for not liking the living arrangement you *didnt* agree to.\n\nHe is valuing his friend over you. Either find a way to hash this out, or get comfortable with him making unilateral decisions for the rest of your relationship.", "NTA.  Your place, you get a say.  I'd be telling the bf that either you or Bob is moving out, he gets to pick which.", "NTA.\n\nBob needs to go. Boyfriend can go with him if it's that important to him.\n\nInsist that your relative do his job, and make it clear that you support him. That relative should not be putting themselves at risk for a moocher.", "ESH.\n\nYour boyfriend for moving his friend in, his friend for taking advantage, and you as well for putting your relative's job in jeopardy.", "Unfortunately you've been saddled with a squatter. NTA he needs to get out of your place ASAP. Bf is a massive a-hole for doing this to you.", "NTA You don\u2019t have a roommate problem you have a BF problem. He didn\u2019t ask you, then belittled you when you questioned it. He then went on to insult you further when you were unsurprisingly unhappy with the situation. Then continues to allow the roommate to live there knowing it\u2019s causing problems in your relationship.\nWorst of all he\u2019s risking all of your living conditions for his friend with any consideration to you all being homeless/fined.\n\nYes Bob is an AH for overstaying etc but if your BF is constantly telling him it\u2019s ok why would he rush?\n\nDo you want to continue living with someone that doesn\u2019t what they want without any care of you agree or if it puts you at risk??", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He is in violation of his own lease by bringing someone in.  If he doesn't follow the rules then they can both be kicked out.
