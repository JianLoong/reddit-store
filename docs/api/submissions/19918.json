That is the action you requested I described, or in this case the inaction. As for why it might make me the asshole, well, I feel that in general people give more sympathy to disabled persons. It is not clear to me if in this case my own reservations weigh more than those sympathies.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You didn't say no because he's disabled, but because you were never that close and you drifted even further apart since, so it would feel awkward and forced.

Can you look into services in the area for him? Then maybe meet with him once and explain that your life is too full for continuing relationship, but you would love to spend some time helping him find resources in the community so he can meet people and get the help he needs.\nI do not blame you at all for not wanting to be in this position. But it does sound like this guy could really use a friend.", "NAH because I have a feeling that the brain trauma alone explain his lack of social grace.", "NAH. But it doesn't reflect well on you.", "kinda yeah...reaching out to be friends and getting shot down sucks.", "NTA: you were very polite. He needs a friend but you are definitely NTA in this.", "NTA, but maybe try just chatting with him via text or Discord or something.  There's a middle ground between \"ignoring his existence\" and \"taking him out\", you know?", "YTA\n\nHe probably reached out to you because he has no one else.\n\nYou deserve as much empathy and compassion as you give.", "YTA. He's in a wheelchair. Give up an afternoon and take him out.", "NAH, but... if you don't harbor any I'll feelings towards him why not spare some time to another fellow human being? I think he is so courageous to have approached you, he is dealing with some major changes and is trying to adapt in a very positive way, as in reaching out to people who shared common interests and trying to have some good time to balance out all the hardship. After all, he's not hogging your phone crying and leaning on your shoulder, he just trying to have a normal-ish day with someone he probably admired back in the day. Don't you think it's worth leaving your own daily domestic comforts for a DAY to give that to this young man who is going through so much? If you were in his shoes you would like that, or you even have the courage to ask for it? Honestly OP I think you could have just as much of a good time as him. Your heart is big enough, it can fit him too for a day.", "YTA: If you were approaching someone and they said no, how would you feel. Just because you don\u2019t know someone well doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t look up to you. You were 10 years older than him at that time, kids always look up to grown ups. Maybe in his mind you were kind and a good guy and a friend. Otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have asked you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
