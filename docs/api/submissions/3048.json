Go home, darling. Stay with your folks. \n\n\nYour boyfriend is a real piece of work, ain't he?\nIf he keeps it up, then you may need to revise your birthing plan. But I will say: have one of your parents, a friend or another trusted relative pick you up from the hospital, when you're discharged. I don't trust your BF. He may take you straight to his over-crowded house, once you leave the hospital. \n\nHopefully, one of his relatives will set him straight about his plans.", "NTA.  Go to your parents *now* if you\u2019re not already there, and talk to the hospital about what you need to do to make sure he can\u2019t just take the baby from you because he\u2019s decided he should be able to do that.  If he complains you\u2019re being unfair, tell him you\u2019re happy to revisit the issue when he starts working *with* you instead of making threats to get his way, much less interpreting \u201cvaluing his family\u201d as \u201cmaking sure they get whatever the hell they want when they want it regardless of how that impacts you *or* the baby.\u201d", "NTA, Jesus, you'll have just given birth.\n\nThere's absolutely no need to introduce your baby to the family (whether yours or his) by the second day. Any reasonable person will... well, understand that you've *just given birth* and probably need peace and quiet and recuperation.", "NTA at all! The baby shouldn\u2019t even be exposed to that many people in the first few weeks anyway due to immunization. The baby can\u2019t get certain shots until week 2. Plus with the newborn you\u2019re going to want the calmest environment possible. And the fact that he\u2019s threatening to take the baby anyway without you is screaming red flags. Be careful OP and I hope you have a healthy and happy delivery.", "NTA\n\nHim threatning that is wrong on so many levels. It's borderline abusive. You should go to your own house and make sure he can't get in, and get an attorney. It's you who's giving birth and then recovering from it, you and the baby are the priority and you both deserve quiet time alone, before anyone sees the baby. It's his own fault with planning around the heartbeat appointment, not yours. \n\nStay safe and please rethink this relationship.", "INFO: how old are the two of you, I feel like you left that out on purpose. \n\nRegardless of your answer I'd still say NTA, there should be absolutely no expectations or demands of you immediately after producing a human being with your body.", "NTA.  What's preventing his family from visiting you and the baby for an hour at some point?", "NTA. You would have just given birth. I think being in a more familiar environment and more peaceful would be most helpful to the adjustments you\u2019d be experiencing. \n\nFamily can alway meet the baby later or can just swing by to visit.", "NTA \n\nFuck that noise. That's so selfish of him! He needs to be thinking of *you* and the baby. You need time to recover as comfortably as you can. A crowded house you don't even live in is not so shockingly not your comfort zone. \n\nYour baby shouldn't even be around that many kids on the first day given it's a terrible RSV season and your baby won't have an immune system.", "As a mother of two.... don't let him guilt you into it.  There is SO MUCH that goes on after the birth of a child.  \n\nGo where YOU feel comfortable.  You are the one giving birth, not him.\n\nNTA", "Absolutely nta. You need peace and quiet and to be comfortable. If he hasn't stopped with those threats about taking the baby then I would seriously suggest someone else being present for the birth and not allowing him in the house unless there is someone else present.", "NTA you would have just pushed a human out of your vagina. When he does the same he can choose were you stay.", "Lots of red flags here. Go where you are most comfortable and supported. And if he is threatening to take a newborn away from its mother to go and meet a whole bunch of people with whatever viruses then he would be staying at his house and nowhere near mine - or the baby. He needs to grow up and prioritiese his family. Ie you and baby. NTA.", "NTA, but you need to think about the future of this relationship and how you\u2019re going to provide your child with a safe and secure home.", "NTA\n\nAs he will be busy working and can't care for the baby, you'll be taking care of them. So you'll go and stay where you'll feel the most comfortable and where it's best for the baby.", "NTA\n\nYou're having the baby. Go wherever you're the most comfortable. And a house with ten people in it is probably not it.", "NTA. That just sounds like too much for a new born.", "NTA, you need to get a lawyer now and file for full custody immediately after birth. Forget this relationship, he is awful and controlling.", "A newborn isn't a possession to show off. \n\nDo not let him manipulate you into taking the blame for things that are not your fault. That is a tactic designed to control you. He makes you feel you did smtg wrong, and then you \u201cowe\u201d him. \n\nGo to your parents and stay there. You may want to consult with a lawyer as well. His household sounds like an extremely chaotic place to bring a newborn home. Your choice to remain in your current home is not an insult to his family. He says you don\u2019t value his family bc of this. That is how he is choosing to frame your decision. In reality, you are simply choosing not to move out of your home into an overcrowded home with a newborn. He is manipulating you. Good luck. NTA.", "NTA but you\u2019re about to have two kids. \n\nTHIS WILL NOT GET BETTER IF YOU STAY WITH BF. He will take your child without permission, risk its health, and has already decided your wants and needs (and your baby\u2019s) don\u2019t matter. Oh, and he blamed YOU for HIS work issues. What a catch.", "YOU would have just birthed a child. What if you need emergency surgery? You need time to adjust! He has no right to take your baby away from you on the second day! What if you decide to breastfeed and he takes the baby to meet his family? Things like this need to be done on the MOTHERS terms, no one elses! \n\nIn no way shape or form are you TA. You do not let this man take your child without your permission!", "NTA. But your boyfriend sure the hell is. He wants to bring a new born baby into a house with 10 people, where you won\u2019t be comfortable. Is he the one pushing a 7 pound person out of his parts? No, didn\u2019t think so, having a baby is hard on a mothers body, and you will need rest and relaxation. His work schedule is not your problem.", "NTA and maybe have your dr explain that the baby shouldn't be exposed to that many people, especially with 8 being school and daycare age with all those illnesses going around, yet. Make arrangements maybe for his parents to come see the baby at your home for an hour or so on the second day? Minus all the kids. Tell him he can send lots if pictures and even some videos to them instead. Also I totally agree with those who said have your parents drive you home. I don't trust him not to detour to his house otherwise.", "NTA. You are definitely not the a55hole and your boyfriend is very selfish to expect you to take a newborn to a home with 10 people eight of them under the age of 12. he's placing the newborn at risk with eight children under the age of 12,  that's such a germ fest.  At That point the baby has not had any time to develop immunities  even if you're breastfeeding .\n\nMaybe you could tell the staff at the hospital what his desires are when he's not in the room, and have them come in at the time of discharge and say something like in order to the protect the baby since the new orn's immune system hasn't developed yet, be sure to keep the baby away from a lot of people in the first few weeks,  especially children who are not known for cleanliness and washing their hands and covering their face if they're sneezing or have a runny nose.", "NTA. He lost the second he threatened to take your child from you. Get a plan in place and do not leave the hospital with him and inform the hospital staff of his threats.", "NTA. Stay with your parents and don't let him know when you go into labor. He is already threatening and abusive. You might want to talk with an attorney before he can try to pull any BS. He sounds like the kind that will try and take the baby to get what he wants.", "NTA but the next 18 years of your life are going to be hell if this man is the father.. Good Luck with that one.", "Nta. Protect yourself and your baby. He doesn't sound very nice", "Show him some videos of babies with rsv or Covid. He thinks 8 kids under 12 will understand they can\u2019t touch and kiss a baby?? What an idiot, NTA.", "NTA. Go to your house, to your family. Your boyfriend doesn't get to choose.", "Lol no.\n\nYes work is important and it sucks he didn't or couldn't arrange a shift swap or time off to hear babys heart beat for the first time, but that doesn't mean he gets to dictate where YOU recover from giving birth.\n\nYou will need peace, rest and help. Not chaos. He can not threaten to take baby anywhere. His own mother should understand that after birthing so many kids herself that you don't take a newborn to meet that many people all at once! \n\nNTA. Stick to your guns.", "Nta. He can't just take him. Please protect yourself.", "Honestly, I would not be telling this dude the baby was here until I was home, at YOUR house, from the hospital.

This is going to be best in an environment you are comfortable in \n2. Your baby\u2019s health - RSV is TERRIBLE right now. Going to a place with 10 people living in it is inviting sickness into your and your baby\u2019s lives \n3. Babies cry and babies need sleep - both of these will be easier in a house with fewer people. Honestly I think it\u2019s rude to the children in that house to impose a baby on them \n4. Attention - all your attention will need to go to your newborn, living in a house with 10 people your attention is likely to be pulled away constantly \n\nAnd finally, while I do not know the answer to this so I cannot add it to the list, who will be the primary care giver for the child? If it will be you, you need to prioritize yourself and your child and be in an environment you are both comfortable with. I do not know the dynamics at your bfs house, but I wouldnt be surprised if while you are in a house with 8 children under 12 you are expected to help look after them too. You need to be prioritizing your child and your well-being. Go be with your mom.", "NTA. please don't allow yourself to be bullied into an unsafe environment for you or your newborn.

We didn\u2019t let anyone meet her for 3 months (pre-pandemic). There was a whooping cough outbreak as well. People understood and respected our boundaries. Besides your mental and physical recuperation, that time with your baby is precious and isn\u2019t owed to anyone.", "NTA \n\nHe is being irresponsible. Please consider getting an attorney and tell BF to contact to doctor for a professional explanation as to why the baby shouldn't see so many people immediately. \n\nYou go where you can be comfortable.", "NTA your bf is not being logical right now because you staying in his overcrowded family home makes no sense, it\u2019ll be putting a newborn at risk of illness, you getting no time to relax and bond in peace.

He doesn\u2019t have to like it but he does have to respect/accept it. \n\nA breast fed baby cannot be taken away from mum for long periods because they need to eat so common sense states he can\u2019t just take the baby away without you and he can\u2019t force you to go anywhere without being arrested for kidnapping etc", "NTA - go home and stay home. After birth you should be limiting the babies contact with people because he/she doesn\u2019t have an immune system yet. Also you will have just pushed a human out of your body, you will need rest and quiet where YOU are comfortable! The fact that he is drawing a line in the sand and making threats is very worrisome. Talk to the hospital and your family and let them know he is not allowed to take the baby anywhere without you. Be ready to have cops called if he insists. His family can come to your house to see the baby, in small groups, if they want to.", "NTA \n\nDo not move in with him and his family.

I'd go home and tell him the baby will meet everyone when I'm feeling up to it and recovered, and they can video chat to see the baby and have pictures sent.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to realize it's best for you two to bond with the baby, not everyone and their brother. Does he not realize how physically demanding and exhausting beith is going to be? You're not gonna want to rest for at least a few days.\n\nHhe needs to chill and tell his family to cool their heels.

We have pretty robust immune systems and have been leveled by a virus circulating right now. \n\nOP, this is a health and safety issue.

He'll be able to show baby off to the family, giving them hours of cuddles with the fresh newborn. And when baby starts to cry (a gentle little wail that will barely scrunch up its perfect little face, more a loud yawn than anything), he'll be able to hand baby back to OP for a feed that will only be 15 minutes long because milk will be coming out of her breasts like turning on the kitchen tap. No mastitis, no \"ow this really hurts\", no 3 hour feed because the baby is suckling for comfort more than food and screams the place down as soon as you remove the boob.\n\nIt will all be clean and sterile and perfect, because that's how it is in his silly little head. He won't get peed on, pooped on, or vomited on (either by OP during labour or by the baby afterwards) because that never happens. He won't have to help OP to the bathroom, or into the shower, nor need to change the bedsheets because of course you don't bleed through those enormous post-natal pads at any time.\n\nJust all perfect, perfect, perfect.\n\n(I don't mean to put OP off with any of this.

Not sure what the lawyer would even do far from a restraining order, which is pretty premature, and a surefire way to start coparenting in a a completely adversarial way. If I thought the threat was genuine maybe, but it was a young man who thought (wrongly) that he had equal rights as the mom making blustery statements basically saying his family has rights to see the kid., he\u2019s wrong but he has three months to figure that out. Your world seems amazingly black and white with more imaginary resources that the less fortunate simply do not have access to."]}
