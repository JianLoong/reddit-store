If it is just pain or tiredness, then people tend to brush it off because it is not visible. So they write off as not being real because it is mentally easier. \n\nOnce you start falling over, losing/gaining weight, failing grades it gets an objective existence. They can't ignore it because they can see real world impacts. I suspect you've been putting in more effort to do the same but they see unchanged behaviour. And parents don't want, in the main, to consider their children are ill. \n\nIt is incredibly frustrating to be ignored esp if struggling. But not sure your parents only care about your appearance. The physical symptom has given weight to your words so they are now acting. Really hope you solve quickly and feel a lot better soon.", "NTA. You are correct. So many illnesses are hidden. As soon as this became a physical thing they acted.  They were disrespectful to your raising concerns about your health before this. That\u2019s sad.", "NTA.

Someone breaks a bone\u2014they see it, they know it\u2019s bad, they comprehend. But someone has a concussion\u2014they can\u2019t see, they don\u2019t really get it. I think your parents just didn\u2019t really understand and behaved like a lot of people do with invisible problems. But now that it\u2019s become viable, it\u2019s a measure for them to truly grasp how serious this problem is. It\u2019s like cancer\u2014invisible until it isn\u2019t either on a test result or scan or taking a toll on someone\u2019s health. It\u2019s very much the reality with the invisible disabilities and neurodivergence unfortunately", "Here is the thing , lots of screen time can affect your sleep.
