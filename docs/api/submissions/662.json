My ex husband and I tried everything to have kids but it just never happened. He divorced me, went and married someone younger who was able to give him a kid and from what I gather, they're expecting a 2nd child together. It hurts like hell seeing someone else have what I couldn't. I get frustrated with myself sometimes and with family blaming me for basically everything. I turn to my friends for support, Especially \"Alessia\", she's in the same \"infertility boat\" as me but she and her husband are currently trying IVF hoping it'd work.\n\n\nAlessia asked me for help to pay for her upcoming IVF cycle. I agreed to write her a check of $12,000, I really wanted to help her and the money came with no strings attached. I wrote the check and gave it to her last week. She was very appreciative of it.\n\n\nThe very next day, I got a sudden message from a mutual friend \"Carol\" with a screenshot of the conversation she had with Alessia. Turns out she and Alessia were talking about the next IVF cycle, and Alessia said she hoped the cycle would work because \"she didn't wanna end up divorced, and having her husband go marry someone younger and have a baby with them and another one on the way! While she's alone and without a family at 35! (She's 32). I was stunned and...hurt, I knew she meant me here. But I did not confront her I simply contacted my bank and cancelled the check. In the evening, Alessia called to ask why I cancelled the check and I told her. She went batshit saying she didn't mean it that way and that she thought that this was somewhat an \"inside joke\" between \"desperate infertile women\". She came over with her husband the next day begging I write another check but I refused. An argument ensued and her husband thought I wasn't being supportive of her like when she supported me throughtout my struggles. She left crying and we haven't talked since then. Her husband keeps reminding me (while repeatedly calling Carol a toxic snake) of the date of the next cycle saying they can't have it after I took the money that was supposed to pay for it back!.\n\n\nSome friends thinks I'm being oversensitive. Carol's on my side telling me to tell them to go to hell but I feel so bad about it. what I've done might just damage our 15 years of friendship. Maybe I shouldn't have cancelled it but I just felt so offended by what she said about me and how she basically mocked my unfortunate circumstances.\n\n\nso reddit, AITA?\n\n\nHello again! And Wow thank you so so much for all this support and compassion that you've shown me. I could feel it through my screen (LOL \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23) I have decided I'm going to put some distance between me and\nAlessia. Things have been rough lately and I think that distance is what I need right now especially for my mental health. After reading some comments here I now feel less heavy and more relieved. Doesn't change the fact that I'm still feel completely and utterly shocked by Alessia's behavior. It's a shame having to come to the realization that even those who are supportive of you the most, could cause as much harm.\n\n\nOh and by the way, I sent Carol a link for this thread to see what her thoughts were and she just laughed.

And far more empathy to you than Alyessa did.\n\nMaybe Alyessas words came from a place of fear.

That doesn't make it okay. This could be a lesson that helps her grow out of her small lesser self, that being hurt or in fear doesn't excuse hurting others. What you say comes back to you so be gentle. There is said to be a first thought (like the one your friend said) that first thought is formed without regard or consideration and should be talked back to and reformed, the second thought is the well thought one where you have a chance to better formulate and this is the one that should be communicated.  \n\nNot now when you deserve it the most but there is hope that one day she grows...

And carols got your back, she's a good one who did right by you in this situation so you lose one friend, but your friendship is expanding and deepening with her.
