When you said you were cold, the dad should have agreed to go inside. What kind of asshole wants his guests to be uncomfortable? \n\nI\u2019m scratching my head about why they want to be out there. Dad must have terrible farts.", "Gonna have to say NTA.\n\nYou expressed the fact it was too cold to be eating outside. They chose to ignore you and continue on eating like you said nothing.\n\nAnd then your boyfriend berated you and complained that you were rude to go inside because it was too cold for you to eat outside.\n\nYou need to sit down and have a serious conversation with your boyfriend about this. Eating outside is fine when the weather is good, but eating in 40 F degree weather isn't.", "NTA They were rude, you\u2019re a guest, they should have went inside. Wtf is wrong with them?  45f is COLD.  Maybe they should invest in a patio heater.", "NTA. Look I don\u2019t mind sitting outside in layers when it\u2019s pretty cold, maybe it\u2019s the Scottish upbringing, but I would NEVER expect a guest to come outside or remain outside it it was not a comfortable temperature for them. I would also be checking in on my guests to see where they were most comfortable eating without them having to prompt me. I wouldn\u2019t even agree that \u2018it wasn\u2019t the best thing to do\u2019. You were significantly uncomfortable, shivering and expressed your discomfort to the group before having to make a decision for yourself.

NTA", "NTA you were cold and your attempt to have everyone go inside was rebutted so you went in yourself.

Your BF's family,they are rude. What's more they clearly don't know anything about hosting company, which makes them even ruder. \n\nNTA- you deserve a better boy friend.

Would you let them treat your child that way? \n\ntreat yourself better, you deserve that.", "NTA - sounds like you handled the situation a politely as you could. Sorry they're being weird about it.", "NTA.  Don't return until your boyfriend says that everyone is eating indoors.  This is ridiculous.", "NTA. This is a very strange guy with very strange parents. I'm curious about the details behind the strangeness but it's just voyeurism on my part. No additional info needed. Break up immediately! You can dine out (indoors, with heat!) on this story for years with your friends.

You were polite and everything. \n\nThen your boyfriend berated you for being \u201crude\u201d? \n\nDude\u2026 this is so wild to me\u2026 but you\u2019re definitely NOT the a-hole here.", "NAH. What you did was understandable. You were cold. If the entire family is used to sitting and eating in the cold, it was probably unexpected that you got up and ate inside. I think it would have been better to tackle this with your boyfriend first and then maybe talk to the parents. Internalising it for years and then taking action in the middle of a meal was the worst way to handle it. Just because you were uncomfortable for a long period of time, it doesn't justify doing something anti-social. From their POV, eating outside was fine. Don't expect people to be mind readers. It's a good life lesson on the value of being clear about your needs and not expecting people to just know what you want.\n\n\nI don't know how you move forward because they obviously like to eat out in the cold and you want to be social but are having trouble with the cold. If you're a guest, you probably have to do things the way the family is used to doing it. But you should explain how you're feeling to your boyfriend. Take the anger and the heat out of the situation. Show some understanding for why he saw what you did as rude. Hopefully he will be able to see why you were having trouble. Maybe a good compromise is to get a dryrobe and a hot water bottle for meal times.", "No, rude is making a guest freeze. You may need a new bf. NTA", "NTA. It was rude of them to expect you to eat outside when it was that cold.", "NTA. No rational person should expect anyone else to eat outside when it's only a few degrees above freezing. This isn't normal.", "NTA.   Couple solutions: \n1.  Don\u2019t go over anymore once it gets too cold out, or \n2.  When you sit down at that outside table, start fake sneezing and coughing all over the place without covering your mouth", "NTA.  There's no reason anyone has to eat in the same environment as everyone else if it is physically uncomfortable to them.  This Thanksgiving I will be in a house that is kept close to 80f (27c) so I will venture outside multiple times, sometimes with food and sometimes without.\n\nYour bf grew up doing this so he is acclimated to it, you are not.  He should have encouraged you to go in and warm up.  If they actually found this rude these are probably not people you really want to be around.", "NTA, I have done this at my parents house lol", "BF treatment is second red flag from that family that has no respect for you.", "NTA it's uncomfortable to be cold.  There house there rules but don't ask guests to enjoy them as hospital hosts.", "You and your bf's parents have different attitudes towards temperature.\n\nThey like being outdoors.
