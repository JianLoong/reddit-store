What you did was understandable. You were cold. If the entire family is used to sitting and eating in the cold, it was probably unexpected that you got up and ate inside.

Internalising it for years and then taking action in the middle of a meal was the worst way to handle it. Just because you were uncomfortable for a long period of time, it doesn't justify doing something anti-social. From their POV, eating outside was fine. Don't expect people to be mind readers.

If you're a guest, you probably have to do things the way the family is used to doing it. But you should explain how you're feeling to your boyfriend. Take the anger and the heat out of the situation. Show some understanding for why he saw what you did as rude. Hopefully he will be able to see why you were having trouble.

With, and this is also important, nice wait staff who run out with hot food and run back inside to the nice warm restaurant. We dined surrounded by snow banks one night. We managed.\n\nEven in my Victorian blizzard outfit, I wouldn't be really happy sitting still on an unheated deck in the forties, especially with family style food that is sitting in that refrigerator temperature environment, not being whisked out at the moment of consumption.\n\nYour BF should be apologizing to you for his parent's nuttiness, not berating you. \n\nFor those that insist that isn't really that cold.

You need to have a serious talk with your boyfriend about this and what is appropriate or acceptable behavior at dinner. Forcing people to sit out in the cold when they are in pain is not okay, and the dad is the one being a bad host.\n\nEven if you decide to avoid going to the house on cold days, your boyfriend clearly has no concept of what should be acceptable because he has probably been forced to endure that his entire life.

I hope he's not like that in other aspects of his life.", "wait i went out in -14 celsius today to eat ice cream-", "Eh I used to regularly eat outside in weather as low as 5 degrees celsius when I was living at my first flat, was mostly because that was slightly warmer than the -3 that the interior thermostat measured though!", "I guess you hang around a different kind of Michigan person than I do, so you shouldn't deny my experiences.

Also the mom spends 6 days a week at their country cottage because 1) it\u2019s smaller and easier for her to get around (no stairs to climb) and 2) \u201cso I can have all the hot water I want\u201d she said.", "The one downside of a tankless heater is that if you have hard water, you need to install a softener, as scale will very quickly build up and make it really inefficient and/or just plain not work.", "Or a water heater timer.
