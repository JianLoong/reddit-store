We split amicably back in feb due to me traveling for work, us struggling with long distance, and simply growing apart. He and I had never ever fought (like really fought) through the entire relationship and breakup. We see each other quite often because we share the same friends and a dog that we both love and agreed to copawrent. When we see each other, we simply catch up like friends and it\u2019s never been an issue. \n\nUntil November. We got into an argument. A lot of pent up feelings came up (him expressing hurt about me leaving, me being frustrated that he never conveyed those feelings to me or asked me to stay) that turned into anger toward one another. A couple days later we made up and hugged it out. And this all happened in private btw but ofc we talked to our friends about it so they knew.\n\nSo bride has understandably been having a lot of anxiety about us at the wedding and worried something between us will come up. She has, however, not talked to me at all about it. I tried talking to her while the fight was going on but was pretty much met with silence. My other girlfriends were very supportive and gave me advice, despite their SOs also being friends with my ex. It was a tricky situation because we are all friends, but i wasn\u2019t asking anyone to take sides, just really needed a friend in that moment and didn\u2019t get that from her.\n\nSo instead of talking to me and just asking where X and I stand, she\u2019s nixed me from the bridal party and disinvited me from the wedding altogether. And ended it with \u201cI love you, you\u2019re one of my closest friends, I just have to think about me and my wedding right now\u201d\n\nI\u2019m trying to be understanding that she has wedding brain, she has anxiety, and she has every right to be stressed about me and ex together but I can\u2019t help feeling so hurt that she doesn\u2019t trust me as a friend to be 100% there for her on her wedding day.\n\nIs it really terrible of me not to go to her shower?

Also, why are you the only one being asked to back out? Two people are required for a relationship to succeed or fail (or exist at all).", "NTA tell her you value your friendship and her opinon and therefore have decided to let her completely focus on her wedding by not attending any wedding related events.\n\nAs for the dog thing, I'd let that go but never do it again.", "NTA and im struggling to understand why you think you would be? your \u2018friend\u2019 (and im using the term loosely) made a decision to cut you out of her wedding and disinvite you all together but you still feel obligated to get her a gift? she clearly sees your relationship very differently then you do and it\u2019s time to protect yourself and not try and cater to her. you owe her nothing and i really would recommend taking space from her.", "NTA \n\nFirst, inviting someone to a bridal shower and not the wedding is hella tacky imo.

Maybe I can see asking you to step down as a bridesmaid but univiting to the wedding?! That\u2019s friendship ending level behavior.\n\nAnd I know this is secondary but consider how this plays out with your friend group. I fear you will end up being outed if you don\u2019t control the narrative. So 100% don\u2019t just ghost the bridal shower. Talk to your friends about this fall out as well.

I would take some space from the bride and cool the friendship. She didn't even talk to you and just dropped you and uninvited you from the wedding. She clearly chose a side and that of your ex.

It\u2019s a little icky, but understandable that she would make the decision to ask you to step down as a bridesmaid if she\u2019s worried about conflict with the officiant because you\u2019d have to spend a lot of time around each other. It is absolutely not understandable and certainly not friend behavior to disinvite you from the wedding entirely. That is a ridiculous overreaction to what you\u2019ve described in your post, and it\u2019s really unreasonable. It sounds like she\u2019s not a very good friend anyway, but if this behavior is truly out of the ordinary for her I\u2019d wonder if she has had some kind of misunderstanding around what happened between you and your ex. If you value your friendship with her, I\u2019d check in and make absolutely certain that there hasn\u2019t been some kind of mistake. In the same vein, definitely mention this to your other friends and/or your ex. \n\nIn any event, why are you even invited to the shower if you\u2019re not a bridesmaid, much less not invited to the wedding? That is absurd, definitely a blatant gift grab, and you most certainly should not be spending a cent or a second on this person. You\u2019ll be a big AH to yourself if you keep doing things for her. \n\nHopefully this is all just a misunderstanding, and I hope everything goes well for you!", "YWNBTA.

Do something nice for yourself on the day of the shower; I think it's very fair to consider your dog sitting your gift, don't give them more. If you can resist sending the venmo request I think that's the best call: you said one of your friends was already very mad on your behalf, so doing a major favor for those friends and then being treated like this makes them look way worse. Don't muddy the gossip waters by sending a request they probably will not pay, let your friend group deliver the consequences for this choice to the bride and groom.

You deserve much better.", "If you aren\u2019t invited to the wedding, you have no business being invited to the shower or bachelorette.\n\nThat is what you would call a \u201cgift grab\u201d by the bride.

Cutting you from the bridal party is enough, not inviting you to the wedding at all is pretty serious.  Does she expect that you and your ex would have a food-fight at the reception?  And why not disinvite both of you?\n\nYou need to decide if you want to be friends with the bride going forward.  If you do, you might consider going to the shower, but if you skip it, and she says anything, you could just say that you are having nothing to do with her wedding (including sending a gift) as she requested.\n\nHas she done anything to keep your relationship going?  If not, I'd asked myself if this is going to have an effect on your friend group, or if they will take sides if you simply aren't as close to her any more.  You might not want to keep this relationship going.", "NTA, your \"friend\" clearly picked a side, and it wasn't you. Shes not a good friend. \n\nShe clearly has no shame and you don't owe her a shower gift.\n\nYou need to tell the friend group that you were dininvited and the reason why, before she spins her narrative.", "NTA. The only asshole here is the bride. Who not only made it clear that she doesn\u2019t value you as a friend, but has no doubt created drama for herself in the process of uninviting you. \nI\u2019m sorry you are going through this.

NO GIFT.", "You're not invited to the wedding, therefore shouldn't be invited to the shower as pre-wedding events are for wedding guests only.\n\nAlso, this woman is not your friend", "Don't go.

What possible reason would there be for you to go the shower? Your \"friend\" is behaving abominably. I know that you don't want this to fracture your friend group, but I doubt that that is possible.

Are your friends all going to feel obliged to take sides if this causes a rift? And if so, how much do you care about potentially alienating some friends?\n\nIf you do end up going for the sake of being nice, make it clear that your period of dog-sitting was gift enough, and she shouldn\u2019t expect any further gifts because people who aren\u2019t invited to the wedding are not expected to provide them.", "Eh, just skip it.

I'm not sure if there's a law saying that a dog get 'one free bite' - saw it in a 'Lassie' episode once, but it may have been scrapped since then - but if that dog is dangerous they need at least a warning.

At this point they are just using him because if he was a groom he\u2019d be kicked out right?", "But as her close friend you are also necessary", "Everyone is replaceable", "I\u2019ll be honest there were a few people at my shower that were not invited to the wedding\u2026but in my defence my shower was a surprise planned by my aunts so I had no input to the guest list!", "Bride is expecting OP to attend because she wants the gift that OP would presumably bring.", "Did she ask you to dog sit before or after she uninvited you?", "What if someone else, like a child, gets bitten by a dog in the meantime?", "I like that for every relationship, redditors always suggest the nuclear option in full confidence like the backseat advisors that they are who obviously didn't have many meaningful relationships (if any at all) growing up.\n\nSO forgot your birthday? Break up with him. \n\nMother bought sibling a bigger toy? Do not contact your family for good.\n\nHad a little argument with your friend? Rethink the relationship and cut them off your life.", "Bride is obviously not aware that things like engagement parties and showers and hens night and such are related to the wedding. You don't invite people to your shower who aren't invited to the wedding. It's tacky as hell.", "Yeah, that's the feeling I get, which is pretty shameless of the bride.  Bride is welcome to disinvite wedding guests but that means no wedding gifts from them.", "This was over a month ago, well before", "I\u2019m wondering if the texts that were sent to the bride for \u201csupport\u201d are being downplayed. The disinvite seems to have followed that.", "Getting kicked out of a friend's wedding and disinvited because of a spat with a third party is more than \"a little argument with your friend\".", "If you guys are that tight-knit as a group, have any of them backed you up. She's gonna create more drama for herself because a lot of people are gonna ask where you are", "She could have just shut up about it and not said anything to anyone.  She created her own problem.", "Yeah but it's also a relatively minor reason to completely cut off someone.\n\nI guess ya'll really just have too shallow relationships to end things on stuff like this.", "If you and ex are still reasonably friendly, you need to call him or text him about this wild situation. It will be revealing for you to hear what he has to say.", "Uh, that's a pretty dramatic demonstration of \"you aren't important enough for my important life events\". It's a *symptom of a shallow relationship*.\n\nI think it's funny that you define that as a deep relationship, when I'd consider it pretty shallow. If a friend that I'm close to, there for emotionally, etc. suddenly decides they don't want me present for an important life event which other friends are invited to, that's.... a very clear statement of how they see the relationship.", "I know a kid that completely cut ties with his parents, just because they vote differently than he does.  It's getting crazy out there.", "Call the ex and tell him what is going on. Ask him to speak to the groom about the bride's stunt and about the fact that she is legitimately ruining a friendship over something that is not only none of her business but is also a non issue since you two get along fine.\n\nNTA.\n\nThe bride is flat out rude and incredibly immature. The fact that she couldn't even have a real conversation with you about this is just bonkers.", "Dang. I saw your original post on r/weddingplanning before you got disinvited. That SUCKSSS, I\u2019m sorry. She doesn\u2019t sound like a very good friend. I wouldn\u2019t bother with her shower either!", "Texting him tomorrow (it\u2019s 2am here)", "First, I didn't really say anything about them having a deep relationship. Im more of saying how most aita resolutions in general involving minor disagreements have suggestions of nuclear options, and followed it up by saying most redditors have very shallow relationships (if any at all).\n\nSecondly, as evident by many aita threads here, women oftentimes get at the highest point of their emotional anxiety before their wedding, so mightve been a costly mistake, but still kinda a one-off thing and not necessarily a the way the bride looked at their relationship and more of a panic eject button (because she cant instead kick the guy out because hes needed)", "Hoping you give us an update! If not, you're not invited to my wedding! Also, def NTA here. Sounds like the bride has some stuff to work out.", "Please update us when you do.", "Sure, some reddit posts are very quick to go nuclear. I don't really think this is one of them, though. If a close friend kicked me out of her wedding, I'd view it as *her* jettisoning the relationship. That's kind of what \"kicking someone out of your wedding\" entails.\n\nYou have no basis to assume that \"most redditors have very shallow relationships\", and of all posts, this one is not very demonstrative of that fact. It's not \"shallow\" to expect your friends to care about you.\n\nAnd I just don't accept that \"wedding stress\" is any excuse. I'm married. All my friends are married. Somehow we all managed to get through it without any bullshit, because we're all *reasonable people*. Even the one friend who kind of had a mess of a wedding and some family shit went down didn't just go around cutting people off. \n\nSo like... I posit that people who find it easy to just eject people from their important events don't actually care very much about those people.", "Oh wow!\n\nCall the ex. Tell him what is going on. I think he is likely the ONLY person who can put a stop to this and call the bride out on her nasty petty behavior.\n\nAs for you - don't bother with the shower. No wedding invitation? No gifts. \n\nHere is the thing. You need to be SUUUUUPER low drama from here on out (even if you were before) so as not to stir up crap in the friend group. Make her look as crazy as she is behaving by being super chill. That doesn't mean allow yourself to be walked all over but set the record straight with friends, too. \n\nSend this text to your ex:\n\n\"Hey, I thought things were fine between us after our conversation. Is something going on I don't know about? Bride just disinvited me from everything because she's afraid you and I will cause drama... I'm really confused.\"\n\nOnce you hear back from him, assuming he has not made an issue out of anything, send this to your friends:\n\n\"Hey ladies - just wanted to let you all know I've been disinvited from being part of the wedding party and disinvited to (name's) wedding. Not entirely clear why. She said its because she doesn't want drama between (name) and I but we've figured our crap out and we've always been low drama so... I'm just confused and hurt. At any rate, its her wedding so its obviously her choice and I respect that. Have fun with all of the wedding events.\"\n\nAnd, honestly? I'd book a trip for yourself over the shower and over the wedding with other friends or to visit family so you aren't even there for it. \n\nGo live your best life. This girl wasn't a good friend to begin with.\n\nAnd no more dog sitting.", "Ok, there it is. She\u2019s not your friend.", "Honestly, this is good, I\u2019m going to text the ex tomorrow.\n\nAs for my girlfriends, I\u2019ve already texted one but not the other, only because I know she\u2019s really good friends with the bride and I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve discussed it and I don\u2019t want to put her in a position where she\u2019s in the middle", "This is good advice! \u2b06\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4d", "Me too."]}
