He and I had never ever fought (like really fought) through the entire relationship and breakup.

A lot of pent up feelings came up (him expressing hurt about me leaving, me being frustrated that he never conveyed those feelings to me or asked me to stay) that turned into anger toward one another. A couple days later we made up and hugged it out. And this all happened in private btw but ofc we talked to our friends about it so they knew.\n\nSo bride has understandably been having a lot of anxiety about us at the wedding and worried something between us will come up. She has, however, not talked to me at all about it. I tried talking to her while the fight was going on but was pretty much met with silence. My other girlfriends were very supportive and gave me advice, despite their SOs also being friends with my ex.

If you guys are that tight-knit as a group, have any of them backed you up. She's gonna create more drama for herself because a lot of people are gonna ask where you are", "YWNBTA, this is a wild situation and it seems like the only one not handling it like an adult is the bride. Also, why are you the only one being asked to back out? Two people are required for a relationship to succeed or fail (or exist at all).", "NTA tell her you value your friendship and her opinon and therefore have decided to let her completely focus on her wedding by not attending any wedding related events.\n\nAs for the dog thing, I'd let that go but never do it again.", "NTA and im struggling to understand why you think you would be? your \u2018friend\u2019 (and im using the term loosely) made a decision to cut you out of her wedding and disinvite you all together but you still feel obligated to get her a gift? she clearly sees your relationship very differently then you do and it\u2019s time to protect yourself and not try and cater to her. you owe her nothing and i really would recommend taking space from her.", "NTA \n\nFirst, inviting someone to a bridal shower and not the wedding is hella tacky imo. So to me that is your out \u201cyou uninvited me to the wedding, why would I go to your shower? That\u2019s just a more intimate wedding event.\u201d\n\nBut I\u2019d call her on the \u201cyou are one of my closest friends\u201d but because she sure isn\u2019t acting like it. Maybe I can see asking you to step down as a bridesmaid but univiting to the wedding?! That\u2019s friendship ending level behavior.\n\nAnd I know this is secondary but consider how this plays out with your friend group. I fear you will end up being outed if you don\u2019t control the narrative. So 100% don\u2019t just ghost the bridal shower. Talk to your friends about this fall out as well. They may be all \u201coh that\u2019s her choice and you know how she is\u201d in which case you know how this goes with the rest of them. \n\nGood luck.", "YWNBTA. I would take some space from the bride and cool the friendship. She didn't even talk to you and just dropped you and uninvited you from the wedding. She clearly chose a side and that of your ex. I would do them no favours and do low key low contact for a while.", "NTA, do not go to her shower and definitely don't send her a gift. Your friendship with her seems to be very one-sided. Has she been supportive prior to this incident? Has she gone over and beyond for you as much as you have for her?", "You would absolutely WNBTA. It\u2019s obvious that she would feel awkward. It\u2019s a little icky, but understandable that she would make the decision to ask you to step down as a bridesmaid if she\u2019s worried about conflict with the officiant because you\u2019d have to spend a lot of time around each other. It is absolutely not understandable and certainly not friend behavior to disinvite you from the wedding entirely. That is a ridiculous overreaction to what you\u2019ve described in your post, and it\u2019s really unreasonable. It sounds like she\u2019s not a very good friend anyway, but if this behavior is truly out of the ordinary for her I\u2019d wonder if she has had some kind of misunderstanding around what happened between you and your ex. If you value your friendship with her, I\u2019d check in and make absolutely certain that there hasn\u2019t been some kind of mistake. In the same vein, definitely mention this to your other friends and/or your ex. \n\nIn any event, why are you even invited to the shower if you\u2019re not a bridesmaid, much less not invited to the wedding? That is absurd, definitely a blatant gift grab, and you most certainly should not be spending a cent or a second on this person. You\u2019ll be a big AH to yourself if you keep doing things for her. \n\nHopefully this is all just a misunderstanding, and I hope everything goes well for you!", "YWNBTA. Seems like the bride is making the drama herself rather than avoiding it.", "YWNBTA. SHE unceremoniously kicks you out of her bridal party without talking to you first.

Do something nice for yourself on the day of the shower; I think it's very fair to consider your dog sitting your gift, don't give them more. If you can resist sending the venmo request I think that's the best call: you said one of your friends was already very mad on your behalf, so doing a major favor for those friends and then being treated like this makes them look way worse. Don't muddy the gossip waters by sending a request they probably will not pay, let your friend group deliver the consequences for this choice to the bride and groom. I'm sorry these people were such awful friends to you. You deserve much better.", "If you aren\u2019t invited to the wedding, you have no business being invited to the shower or bachelorette.\n\nThat is what you would call a \u201cgift grab\u201d by the bride.

Cutting you from the bridal party is enough, not inviting you to the wedding at all is pretty serious.  Does she expect that you and your ex would have a food-fight at the reception?  And why not disinvite both of you?\n\nYou need to decide if you want to be friends with the bride going forward.  If you do, you might consider going to the shower, but if you skip it, and she says anything, you could just say that you are having nothing to do with her wedding (including sending a gift) as she requested.\n\nHas she done anything to keep your relationship going?  If not, I'd asked myself if this is going to have an effect on your friend group, or if they will take sides if you simply aren't as close to her any more.  You might not want to keep this relationship going.", "NTA, your \"friend\" clearly picked a side, and it wasn't you. Shes not a good friend. \n\nShe clearly has no shame and you don't owe her a shower gift.\n\nYou need to tell the friend group that you were dininvited and the reason why, before she spins her narrative.", "NTA. The only asshole here is the bride. Who not only made it clear that she doesn\u2019t value you as a friend, but has no doubt created drama for herself in the process of uninviting you. \nI\u2019m sorry you are going through this. Breaking up with a friend is so painful. You don\u2019t deserve this, especially while you are still navigating the loss of a serious relationship.", "YWNBTA\n\nThe bride is INSANE. Is she okay ? Why do brides have to make everyone\u2019s life around them miserable or make every situation about themselves. Have you talked to your ex about this ? What does he think of this ?

Your true friends showed you who they are by giving advice even though their partners are friends with your ex.", "YWNBTA\n\nGoing Low contact is good but I would just let the friendship end and go my own way for good. Forget her and her dog. Uninviting you from the wedding is still choosing a side and she didn\u2019t even think much of you to have a conversation first. It sucks & it\u2019s hurtful but at least you know now. Do not buy a gift. No Wedding? NO GIFT.", "You're not invited to the wedding, therefore shouldn't be invited to the shower as pre-wedding events are for wedding guests only.\n\nAlso, this woman is not your friend", "Don't go.

You are being too gracious. I'm sorry, even if you said you'd watch the dog for free, that's BS. She should have comped you in some way. \n\nAnd she's being a jerk by just ousting you from the wedding without talking to you.", "NTA\u2026 but don\u2019t send a venmo cause that just going to escalate things.

It\u2019s not okay at all that she drop you out.", "NTA - she\u2019s excluded you from the bridal party and wedding, which also includes the shower and Bach IMO. She gets no gifts either.

What possible reason would there be for you to go the shower? Your \"friend\" is behaving abominably. I know that you don't want this to fracture your friend group, but I doubt that that is possible.

I wouldn't buy a gift though.", "NTA. The bride sounds just awful for doing that to you. Booting you from the bridal party is one thing, but uninviting you? That\u2019s a low blow. I\u2019m not sure how she expects to still be friends after doing that.", "Girl, send that Venmo request and do NOT go to that bridal shower. She\u2019s a trash friend and you deserve better.", "NTA she\u2019s prioritizing being the center of attention for one day over a friendship. That\u2019s not a friend.

Are your friends all going to feel obliged to take sides if this causes a rift? And if so, how much do you care about potentially alienating some friends?\n\nIf you do end up going for the sake of being nice, make it clear that your period of dog-sitting was gift enough, and she shouldn\u2019t expect any further gifts because people who aren\u2019t invited to the wedding are not expected to provide them.", "Eh, just skip it. You\u2019re never required to go somewhere that you don\u2019t really want to no matter the reason or relationship. People would be much happier if they realized that.", "YWNBTA", "NTA.

Ends up looking like a bold faced gift grab.", "YWNBTA. \n\nIf you\u2019re not invited to the wedding, you shouldn\u2019t be on the wedding shower invite list.\n\nIf you were fired from being a bridesmaid, there should be security at the shower (and the wedding) making sure that you don\u2019t try to sneak in and start trouble.  Not that you would do that, but someone who was deservedly fired from being a bridesmaid could well be up to no good.   \n\n\nThe bride here made choices to uninvite you from the wedding and the wedding party.

Find out the rate for dog sitters/house sitters.  Also make sure you have pictures of the scars and tell them the police will hear if you're not paid.\n\nThen don't go to the wedding, don't give them a present, and maybe file a report on the dog anyway.  I'm not sure if there's a law saying that a dog get 'one free bite' - saw it in a 'Lassie' episode once, but it may have been scrapped since then - but if that dog is dangerous they need at least a warning.  It's not fair for an untrained dog to be put down because the owners are idiots who won't train it not to bite.", "Send a venmo request for that dog sitting for at least $100.

Friends have trust and want you around.", "ESH.\n\nThe friend is not your friend, such things are not done.\n\nYou will not be TA for not attending the party but you were one for airing your argument with your ex in front of your entire \"friend\" group. There are some advantages in being discreet.", "NTA but the rest of the friend group, and maybe your ex-, may have contributed in some way to her perception of the risk of leaving you in the bridal party.

I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else yet though, but I\u2019m sure the bride and groom have discussed it prior with ex", "Well, said ex is officiating so\u2026 he is kind of necessary \ud83d\ude05", "Oh thissssdd is the perfect response", "A more intimate wedding event\u2026 that is solely about receiving presents and cash! At least at a wedding there\u2019s a significance to witnessing the ceremony and maybe a meal. All you get out of shower attendance is a dent in your bank account and maybe a dry piece of cake. Just say no, OP!", "> inviting someone to a bridal shower and not the wedding is hella tacky imo\n\nThe only exception is like half a world away destination weddings. But even then you do a pseudo something back home for everyone! Or have your bridal shower right before the wedding at the destination with everyone there.", "Haha my talk of a Venmo request is not in any way serious, just my petty thoughts coming through \ud83d\ude02 \n\nThanks for your response \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "I would not trust a bride that says MY wedding instead of OUR wedding. Is she marrying herself? Where does the groom fit in all this?! NTA, get your petsitting money back and good riddance.", "Do you mind me asking what YWNBTA means? I get NTA but don't understand the extra letters lol", "absolutely send the venmo request and then don\u2019t buy a gift and don\u2019t attend the shower. nta", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Don\u2019t go to the shower and seriously please ponder this friendship dynamic altogether.", "Not really, anyone can officiate if they put in the time/money. I officiated my sisters wedding to her husband.", "He's far from necessary. Literally anyone can be ordained or they can hire one. This is friendship ending to me because she's taken a non-issue and turned it into a large one. What does the rest of the group say? What does the ex say? I'm curious to know how she's spinning this story where somehow you're the unstable one....", "It stands for \u201cYou would not be the AH\u201d", "OP, it would be an easy conversation to start with a quick \"are we really OK, because Bride says it will be too uncomfortable for you to be in the same room as me\" text. \n\nWorst case, this lets you both work through an issue you thought was resolved. In the best case, he has no idea what the heck the bride is talking about and needs to figure out things on his end.", "That's what I'm thinking tbh. Also, I wonder if OP downplayed their role in  the November fight. This feels very sudden, and like the bride and groom were forced to pick a side.", "If OP nixes the friendship entirely though, doesn't she risk getting frozen out of this overly interconnected friendship web?  I guess it depends on who is at the hub of it.  If the rest of the friend group is okay with OP being entirely kicked out like this, that doesn't bode well for her maintaining any of these friendships.", "He is a very good childhood friend of the groom, the groom would never get rid of him lol. So I understand keeping him in and wouldn\u2019t expect them to nix him as well.\n\nBut they definitely could have had a conversation with us together instead of singling me out", "Thank you!", "Like I'm really curious what the bride thinks is gonna happen during the wedding if they basically don't have a massive history of fighting plus the ex is officiating the ceremony. There has to be more to this", "Honestly, there were no sides. Like I said regarding my other friends, I didn\u2019t expect them to pick a side one way or the other, just needed support and advice to navigate through some shit. But it seems the bride and groom took it upon themselves to take a side I guess idk", "It sounds like the origin of this group was that her ex and the groom have been friends since childhood, so there was always a chance she was going to get frozen out anyway after the breakup. They may well have been waiting for the opportunity. She shouldn't spend another minute of time or a cent of her money on the bride. NTA", "I think the larger group is part of the dynamic she needs to ponder - is this friendship web a healthy group if this kind of behavior is tolerated? There is being polite to get along, and then there\u2019s  allowing mistreatment. If OP is accurate, this falls into the latter, and true friends would understand and encourage her to create healthy boundaries with the bride.", "Do you think your ex might really be the motivating force behind your being uninvited? Before you blow up at the bride it might be worth making sure that this whole situation isn't actually due to your ex asking or even insisting they uninvite you.\n\nEditing to add that I still think you should skip the shower, it's immensely tacky to expect you to be there with a gift but not at the wedding. I'm just saying that before you blow up the whole friendship, make sure that this isn't actually about your ex acting like he's ok to your face and telling the couple something totally different.", "Are you not a really good friend though?", "Oh I\u2019m really curious too\n\nSeriously, we\u2019ve had one fight", "I doubt it\u2019s him, I really do think it\u2019s just originating from the bride\u2019s anxiety and wedding brain. My ex is in a new happy relationship, so he would be indifferent if I\u2019m there or not I would think, and also I\u2019ve met his new girlfriend and we got along just fine.", "Well I thought I was \ud83e\udee0", "Yeah, that definitely just sounds like the bride being batshit.", "Maybe it's his new girlfriend.  I would find a new friend. She isn't one.", "There's your answer hun, I wouldn't go to her shower or Bachelorette party either. No gift. Should be no expectation for anything if you're not invited.\n\nAlso, don't give her the excuse of wedding brain, like, no maybe it helps with understanding but it's not justifiable excuse to uninvite you without having a discussion with the two of you about this. \n\nGoodluck!", "In another sub, you said you're out of the wedding party but still invited to the wedding. Here you're saying you're disinvited from the wedding. Which is it?", "Originally it was just the party and today she told me it\u2019s best I don\u2019t go to the wedding at all \ud83e\udee0", "That would end the friendship for me."]}
