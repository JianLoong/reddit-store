I was ecstatic and of course said yes.\n\nBackground:\n\nI dated one of the groomsmen, who also happens to be officiating the wedding, seriously for 5 years. We split amicably back in feb due to me traveling for work, us struggling with long distance, and simply growing apart. He and I had never ever fought (like really fought) through the entire relationship and breakup. We see each other quite often because we share the same friends and a dog that we both love and agreed to copawrent. When we see each other, we simply catch up like friends and it\u2019s never been an issue. \n\nUntil November. We got into an argument. A lot of pent up feelings came up (him expressing hurt about me leaving, me being frustrated that he never conveyed those feelings to me or asked me to stay) that turned into anger toward one another. A couple days later we made up and hugged it out. And this all happened in private btw but ofc we talked to our friends about it so they knew.\n\nSo bride has understandably been having a lot of anxiety about us at the wedding and worried something between us will come up. She has, however, not talked to me at all about it. I tried talking to her while the fight was going on but was pretty much met with silence. My other girlfriends were very supportive and gave me advice, despite their SOs also being friends with my ex. It was a tricky situation because we are all friends, but i wasn\u2019t asking anyone to take sides, just really needed a friend in that moment and didn\u2019t get that from her.\n\nSo instead of talking to me and just asking where X and I stand, she\u2019s nixed me from the bridal party and disinvited me from the wedding altogether. And ended it with \u201cI love you, you\u2019re one of my closest friends, I just have to think about me and my wedding right now\u201d\n\nI\u2019m trying to be understanding that she has wedding brain, she has anxiety, and she has every right to be stressed about me and ex together but I can\u2019t help feeling so hurt that she doesn\u2019t trust me as a friend to be 100% there for her on her wedding day.\n\nIs it really terrible of me not to go to her shower? Like I just really don\u2019t want to spend money on a gift after this lmao. Especially when I feel like I\u2019ve already put a lot into this friendship that I\u2019m not getting back out. (I just watched their obnoxious 1 year old German shepherd\u2014who\u2019s given me scars btw\u2014for 2 weeks while they were abroad for no payment because I am a good friend like that so someone stop me from sending a venmo request right now)\n\nTLDR; Was originally a bridesmaid. Dated groomsman for 5 years and we split in feb. Never fought until November when some pent up feelings came up but we made up and hugged it out. Bride is worried about drama at her wedding and doesn\u2019t want me at the wedding altogether but still wants to be friends and expects me at her shower.\n\nUPDATE: wow, didn\u2019t expect so many responses but appreciate the majority for confirming I\u2019m NTA \ud83d\ude02. Friendship likely over and going to talk to the ex tomorrow (it\u2019s 2am where I live now) just to see where he stands on it\n\nUPDATE 2: So I had texted the bride yesterday (after she had told me over coffee, I pretty much teared up, said I have to go, and left) basically explaining how the ex and I had resolved everything and were good (since we had not talked on it, I figured she might not know) and explaining how hurt i felt that she didn\u2019t trust me enough to talk to me first and humiliated to have been singled out when ex and I are both adults and can handle a conversation together. 24 hours and no response from her.\n\nTalked to the ex. He said that he had just heard from the bride and that he was shocked to hear it. He said we are good as far as he\u2019s concerned. He\u2019s not a petty person and I believe him when he says he didn\u2019t have a hand in any of this. He didn\u2019t really say much else and I didn\u2019t push it because it\u2019s not fair to him to put him in the middle of girl drama lmao. So that\u2019s it for now. I truly think the bride has just gone psycho and deciding to make drama where there is none.\n\nAlso thank y\u2019all for the support and kind words!", "created_utc": 1704172485, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18whe3e/wibta_if_i_dont_attend_my_friends_bridal_shower/", "score": 2216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you guys are that tight-knit as a group, have any of them backed you up. She's gonna create more drama for herself because a lot of people are gonna ask where you are", "YWNBTA, this is a wild situation and it seems like the only one not handling it like an adult is the bride. Also, why are you the only one being asked to back out? Two people are required for a relationship to succeed or fail (or exist at all).", "NTA tell her you value your friendship and her opinon and therefore have decided to let her completely focus on her wedding by not attending any wedding related events.\n\nAs for the dog thing, I'd let that go but never do it again.", "NTA and im struggling to understand why you think you would be? your \u2018friend\u2019 (and im using the term loosely) made a decision to cut you out of her wedding and disinvite you all together but you still feel obligated to get her a gift? she clearly sees your relationship very differently then you do and it\u2019s time to protect yourself and not try and cater to her. you owe her nothing and i really would recommend taking space from her.", "NTA \n\nFirst, inviting someone to a bridal shower and not the wedding is hella tacky imo. So to me that is your out \u201cyou uninvited me to the wedding, why would I go to your shower? That\u2019s just a more intimate wedding event.\u201d\n\nBut I\u2019d call her on the \u201cyou are one of my closest friends\u201d but because she sure isn\u2019t acting like it. Maybe I can see asking you to step down as a bridesmaid but univiting to the wedding?! That\u2019s friendship ending level behavior.\n\nAnd I know this is secondary but consider how this plays out with your friend group. I fear you will end up being outed if you don\u2019t control the narrative. So 100% don\u2019t just ghost the bridal shower. Talk to your friends about this fall out as well. They may be all \u201coh that\u2019s her choice and you know how she is\u201d in which case you know how this goes with the rest of them. \n\nGood luck.", "YWNBTA. I would take some space from the bride and cool the friendship. She didn't even talk to you and just dropped you and uninvited you from the wedding. She clearly chose a side and that of your ex. I would do them no favours and do low key low contact for a while.", "NTA, do not go to her shower and definitely don't send her a gift. Your friendship with her seems to be very one-sided. Has she been supportive prior to this incident? Has she gone over and beyond for you as much as you have for her?", "You would absolutely WNBTA. It\u2019s obvious that she would feel awkward. It\u2019s a little icky, but understandable that she would make the decision to ask you to step down as a bridesmaid if she\u2019s worried about conflict with the officiant because you\u2019d have to spend a lot of time around each other. It is absolutely not understandable and certainly not friend behavior to disinvite you from the wedding entirely. That is a ridiculous overreaction to what you\u2019ve described in your post, and it\u2019s really unreasonable. It sounds like she\u2019s not a very good friend anyway, but if this behavior is truly out of the ordinary for her I\u2019d wonder if she has had some kind of misunderstanding around what happened between you and your ex. If you value your friendship with her, I\u2019d check in and make absolutely certain that there hasn\u2019t been some kind of mistake. In the same vein, definitely mention this to your other friends and/or your ex. \n\nIn any event, why are you even invited to the shower if you\u2019re not a bridesmaid, much less not invited to the wedding? That is absurd, definitely a blatant gift grab, and you most certainly should not be spending a cent or a second on this person. You\u2019ll be a big AH to yourself if you keep doing things for her. \n\nHopefully this is all just a misunderstanding, and I hope everything goes well for you!", "YWNBTA. Seems like the bride is making the drama herself rather than avoiding it.", "YWNBTA. SHE unceremoniously kicks you out of her bridal party without talking to you first.

Give it to her as her wedding present.", "Sounds to me like babysitting the dog was the bridal gift! NTA I think she is being a bit dramatic", "YWNBTA. Do something nice for yourself on the day of the shower; I think it's very fair to consider your dog sitting your gift, don't give them more. If you can resist sending the venmo request I think that's the best call: you said one of your friends was already very mad on your behalf, so doing a major favor for those friends and then being treated like this makes them look way worse. Don't muddy the gossip waters by sending a request they probably will not pay, let your friend group deliver the consequences for this choice to the bride and groom. I'm sorry these people were such awful friends to you. You deserve much better.", "If you aren\u2019t invited to the wedding, you have no business being invited to the shower or bachelorette.\n\nThat is what you would call a \u201cgift grab\u201d by the bride.

NTA unless you decide to go then you\u2019re TA to yourself", "NTA - I don't think that you need to do anything that you don't want to.  Cutting you from the bridal party is enough, not inviting you to the wedding at all is pretty serious.  Does she expect that you and your ex would have a food-fight at the reception?  And why not disinvite both of you?\n\nYou need to decide if you want to be friends with the bride going forward.  If you do, you might consider going to the shower, but if you skip it, and she says anything, you could just say that you are having nothing to do with her wedding (including sending a gift) as she requested.\n\nHas she done anything to keep your relationship going?  If not, I'd asked myself if this is going to have an effect on your friend group, or if they will take sides if you simply aren't as close to her any more.  You might not want to keep this relationship going.", "NTA, your \"friend\" clearly picked a side, and it wasn't you. Shes not a good friend. \n\nShe clearly has no shame and you don't owe her a shower gift.\n\nYou need to tell the friend group that you were dininvited and the reason why, before she spins her narrative.", "NTA. The only asshole here is the bride. Who not only made it clear that she doesn\u2019t value you as a friend, but has no doubt created drama for herself in the process of uninviting you. \nI\u2019m sorry you are going through this. Breaking up with a friend is so painful. You don\u2019t deserve this, especially while you are still navigating the loss of a serious relationship.", "YWNBTA\n\nThe bride is INSANE. Is she okay ? Why do brides have to make everyone\u2019s life around them miserable or make every situation about themselves. Have you talked to your ex about this ? What does he think of this ?

Wish her well on her wedding day via text and let her know you will not be coming to the shower if you need to otherwise just live your life! Your true friends showed you who they are by giving advice even though their partners are friends with your ex.", "YWNBTA\n\nGoing Low contact is good but I would just let the friendship end and go my own way for good. Forget her and her dog. Uninviting you from the wedding is still choosing a side and she didn\u2019t even think much of you to have a conversation first. It sucks & it\u2019s hurtful but at least you know now. Do not buy a gift. No Wedding? NO GIFT.", "You're not invited to the wedding, therefore shouldn't be invited to the shower as pre-wedding events are for wedding guests only.\n\nAlso, this woman is not your friend", "Don't go.  She's not your friend. In fact, maybe you should go lc for now. \n\nNTA", "NTA. If the bride nixed you from the wedding, why is she expecting to turn up for the bridal shower? Isn\u2019t a bridal shower considered part of the wedding celebrations?", "YWNBTA. Fck her, her wedding and her dog. It is not even that deep for her to disinvite you.

You are being too gracious. I'm sorry, even if you said you'd watch the dog for free, that's BS.

It\u2019s not okay at all that she drop you out.", "NTA - she\u2019s excluded you from the bridal party and wedding, which also includes the shower and Bach IMO. She gets no gifts either.

What possible reason would there be for you to go the shower? Your \"friend\" is behaving abominably. I know that you don't want this to fracture your friend group, but I doubt that that is possible.

I wouldn't buy a gift though.", "NTA. The bride sounds just awful for doing that to you. Booting you from the bridal party is one thing, but uninviting you? That\u2019s a low blow.

She\u2019s a trash friend and you deserve better.", "NTA she\u2019s prioritizing being the center of attention for one day over a friendship. That\u2019s not a friend.

Are your friends all going to feel obliged to take sides if this causes a rift? And if so, how much do you care about potentially alienating some friends?\n\nIf you do end up going for the sake of being nice, make it clear that your period of dog-sitting was gift enough, and she shouldn\u2019t expect any further gifts because people who aren\u2019t invited to the wedding are not expected to provide them.", "Eh, just skip it.

Also make sure you have pictures of the scars and tell them the police will hear if you're not paid.\n\nThen don't go to the wedding, don't give them a present, and maybe file a report on the dog anyway.  I'm not sure if there's a law saying that a dog get 'one free bite' - saw it in a 'Lassie' episode once, but it may have been scrapped since then - but if that dog is dangerous they need at least a warning.

If you aren't invited to the wedding, you certainly don't need to go the shower or send a gift.", "I\u2019m always astounded at the number of women willing to throw away friendship for one single event in their lives.", "NTA she tossed herself in to deep into your personal business you shouldn\u2019t go because it\u2019s convenient for her for you to come and bring a gift to the shower but not convenient for you to actually be apart of the big day", "You're only the a-hole if you have anything more to do with this person who is only using you and isn't your friend. \"Sure, buy me a gift...just don't come to the wedding!\" If you're that disposable from her wedding, you clearly don't mean much to her at all. It's time to let go and make new friends. Move on. Life's too short.", "Winning comment honestly", "Guessing she thinks there will be another fight. Talked to the ex today, we established that we are for sure good. Idk her logic is she\u2019s having a wedding and can do what she wants", "You and the bride are like twins. Congrats on being a self absorbed AH like she is.", "Updated", "I\u2019ll be the bot, update posted", "Updated", "I\u2019m not sure, I honestly didn\u2019t push it because I know that he doesn\u2019t want to get caught up in drama and it\u2019s not fair to him to put him in that position, especially since he\u2019s officiating. If he wants to vouch for me then cool, if not, whatever.", "Exactly - \"good enough\" to furnish wedding gifts and cash, but somehow, ***not*** good enough to attend the wedding? That's a \"Tui billboard\" right there (see https://www.pinterest.nz/simdixonnz/tui-yeah-right/)", "Which, if you are burning bridges, can be fun. But not recommended.", ">Idk her logic is she\u2019s having a wedding and can do what she wants\n\nAnd, she can.... but not without consequences.\n\nSis, she is not your friend.\n\nThe next time she texts you, simply tell her that you respect her wishes to not include you in her festivities and you wish her all the best with her marriage.\n\nDo not say anything about not attending the shower, bachelorette party, etc... let her figure out that she destroyed a friendship on her own. I'm sure a few other people will enlighten her.\n\nAnd, seriously - time for you to book a few trips elsewhere to visit friends or family ... or simply to go to a destination you've always wanted to go.", "Ily", "I appreciate your sentiment but no. Him watching one friend shit all over another and using him as the reason should have elicited some sort of response beyond being \u201cshocked\u201d. You and him are both being made out to be immature children and if he doesn\u2019t see that then he definitely knows what is actually happening behind the scenes. Any man would be infuriated at being treated like an emotionally immature child that can\u2019t be trusted to act appropriately without intervention from an \u201cadult\u201d. I don\u2019t trust any of what you are being told bc it doesn\u2019t add up. I agree with how you are choosing to handle this, but make no mistake, anyone who goes along with this idiotic behavior is not your friend, at all. Being a bride to be doesn\u2019t give you a free pass to act like a psycho, and ppl need to stop allowing behavior like this to go unchecked.", "Well that's understandable to all sides I think :)", "Yeah I agree with all of this. The ex is saying suspiciously little. I\u2019m getting vibes that he may not be technically behind this, as in he didn\u2019t ask for OP to be uninvited, but he may have said something about the fight/OP that spiraled out of control and resulted in OP being uninvited. The fact he didn\u2019t say he would even talk to the groom is really dodgy to me. I think there is definitely more to this story that no one is telling OP. \n\nBut I also agree that OP is handing this correctly and it\u2019s pretty much out of her hands.", "Maybe OP will be kind enough to let us know when and where this wedding is so we can crash it and make a scene? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. There is nothing better than wrestling control from someone who feels like they can control everyone and everything without a conscience. I am of course kidding, but I hope they accidentally drop the cake and she completely loses her shit. Kidding again (not really)", "I\u2019m really curious if the groom even knows. Bride only cares about protecting *her* special day", "Tbh I don't think wedding brain exists. It's just an excuse someone uses to act like an asshole. I wouldn't let that even cross your mind as a reason for this. \n\nNTA by the way.", "Don't give her that benefit of the doubt forever. Something else might be going on. You should talk to your ex.", "Welcome to the Dark Side of Bridezilladom.", "Uh... There's a side that's not dark?", "Telling you not to go at all is a ridiculous extreme to take this too. I think that this is a clear sign that she is not as close as a friend as you thought. It is time to move on. I suspect that your ex may not be as 'ok' as he said he was either. I say this with the additional evidence of the dog-sitting encounter.", "YWNBTA \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve seen a few comments saying you were the AH for talking to all your friends and seeking advice during the November fight, and saying you were the AH for trying to consult the bride during the fight. \n\nThough you didn\u2019t ask specifically about that, you also were NTA there (based on the info you provided here). Look, it\u2019s normal to reach out to your close friend group when you\u2019re in distress. You weren\u2019t causing drama by turning to your friends in that moment. You needed advice and emotional support, so you sought it out. \n\nAlso, in November, the wedding would have been half a year out at that point. Asking your friend, the bride-to-be, for advice about your ex/her wedding officiant 6 months before the wedding isn\u2019t too much of an ask on your part. I can understand her reaction being to have a mini freak out if she got too anxious and overthought things, but, again, this happened in November and the wedding is in May. If this happened a week, or even a month, before the wedding, I could understand things going haywire, but it didn\u2019t. It happened in November.", "NTA and that's a hell of a way to find out she's not your friend. Best leave that trash at the kerb. Life's too short to surround yourself with people who don't care about you.", "OP how much of a role might the groom have in you being disinvited ? Sounds like you broke the heart of his childhood friend and it\u2019s plausible he has much stronger feelings about this than he\u2019s conveyed? Maybe he\u2019s the one who wants to protect his buddy and or punish you for past actions? \n\n\nOne other theory is that perhaps on the flip side the bride is worried you may get back together with you ex and \u201csteal her thunder\u201d? Especially since it seems like everyone shares one big friend circle. \n\nI just don\u2019t buy the current explanation from the bride because unless you\u2019ve had a public shouting match with your ex, her concerns about a wedding disruption seem unreasonable.", "That\u2019s easy, I wouldn\u2019t be friends with her anymore. She\u2019s a shitty \u201cfriend\u201d", "NTA\n\nAnd I've never heard of inviting someone to a bridal shower when they're not invited to the wedding. \n\nWhat bad manners. But that's all the bride has demonstrated throughout --- bad manners.", "NTA.  Friends should stick together, but if one friend wants to flick off the other friend like a sticky booger, then I say \"Fly!  Be free!\"", "NTA\n\nAt this point she\u2019s shown you she doesn\u2019t consider you a friend but probably wants you to go to the shower for the gifts.", "NTA. *Do not buy the bride a gift!*", "Not TA.  \n\\- Listen to Your Heart. It's perfectly ok to skip the shower if it feels too painful. You deserve to feel 1. comfortable and 2. respected.  \n\\- Speak Your Truth.  If you can, gently but honestly, let her know how her actions made you feel. You owe it to yourself and this friendship to have this final difficult conversation.  \n\\- Friendship Check. Reflect on what this friendship means to you. If the balance of give and take feels off, it might be time to reassess its place in your life.\n\nBig hug!", "NTA. She should have been an adult and discussed this with you. If she was genuinely concerned about drama, she should have asked you both to step down from the wedding party.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Lol WHAT", "https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/former-bridesmaid-asks-she-wrong-skip-bridal-shower-disinvited-wedding\n\nI will usually scroll the different news websites to see what is going on in the world and found this story.
