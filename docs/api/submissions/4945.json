This is my first time posting to reddit so I apologize for it being a lengthy post. My brother in law (30M) and my husband (29M) have always had a strained relationship due to their childhood, how they were raised and their difference in disabilities. This has led to my brother in law having an issue with their mother and constantly talking bad about her to the point where it blatantly shows that he hates her from the bottom of his heart and in turn has a massive amount of hatred for his brother due to their upbringing and such. \n\nOne brother was taken care of more than the other due to the severity of their disabilities. I ended up on the phone with my brother-in -law's wife (31F) who informed me that her husband wants nothing to do with his niece that his brother and I are expecting to be arriving at the beginning of next year . I (28F) always thought that my brother in law and I were on good terms for years since I always asked him not to let the negativity he has for his brother drop down to the child and he agreed that it shouldn't. \n\nNow for some reason he changed his mind and only seems to want to do more harm than good. I just don't understand why the kids have to be hurt in this situation. My brother-in-law and his wife have multiple kids together and my husband has been involved in the children's lives this whole time. \n\nI was also informed by my brother-in laws wife that she can't wait for mother -in -law to pass away so that her husband can receive all of the money from her death since they gave her the most grandkids. I ended up snapping at her saying that it's not the mother -in laws job to provide for her family, it's her husband's and I think that it's very disturbing that her and husband thought that way. I also told her that she has no right to bank on an inheritance that was never hers to begin with. It is only my husband and brother-in laws inheritance. She got upset with me when I pointed out will and estate laws since she seemed to think she had some sort of legal standing in a courtroom to contest a will without her husband. There is so much to unpack and I just don't even know where to start and end. \n\nAITA for snapping on my sister in law about an inheritance that was never rightfully hers to begin with?", "created_utc": 1671275837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zo48lz/aita_for_snapping_on_my_sister_in_law_about_an/", "score": 304, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't have to get drawn into a pointless argument though; next time the topic comes up you can say something like \"that's not how I understand estate laws\" or \"that's really not for me to comment on, that is MIL's business\". \n\nCongrats on the baby on the way and be sure to surround the baby with people who love her/him. If that's not your BIL, (and it doesn't seem like it is), it's much better for the baby if he stays away.\n\nEdited for typos and punctuation.", "NTA. The wife of BIL has no say in this inheritance, and of course neither it's your business. The MIL will decide about the inheritance and if it's going to be split between the two brothers", "NTA. BIL and wife both sound insane. I wonder how much influence her opinion of your MIL there's been in your BIL's opinion and attacks. At this point, I hope your MIL writes BIL out of the will completely. It's not the best outcome for his kids, but that's on him, not on their grandma. In fact, if I were you, I'd start documenting their behavior now. If they do ever try to contest the will, you'll need proof as to why your MIL makes any decision that she does. This awful behavior is a good reason.\n\nCongrats on the baby. You honestly sound better off without them in your lives.", "NTA, but no one rightfully inherits anything just because they are a relative. If a parent has a legal will, s/he can designate where their money/estate goes when they pass. If a parent wants to designate an organization, that's their right.  A child isn't legally entitled to inherit anything by default (unless there is no legally binding will, then laws would dictate how sn inheritance is split). Have the brothers spoken to the parents to see where they stand legally when the parents pass? Perhaps your in-laws will designate the local humane society as their will recipients since it sounds like there's a lot of turmoil brewing in the family and homeless pets would be more grateful.", "NTA. Reading through your answers as well as the original post, your BIL was basically his dad\u2019s golden child and resents the fact that his mother didn\u2019t similarly prioritise him over your husband. The entitlement is breathtaking. And he\u2019s ended up with a wife who matched that sense of entitlement completely.\n\nYou weren\u2019t wrong to tell her that the will was nothing to do with her. She sounds vile. I think sometimes you have to accept that there are people in your life who are toxic. For all that you may want the family harmony, I don\u2019t see what you gain from your child being in contact with your BIL and his wife. \n\nSo congrats on the baby. And good luck building a healthier life with firm boundaries against the toxic sibling and his wife.", "NTA.  Commenting that you can't wait for someone to die is awful, regardless of the circumstances.  You calling out that BS is a good thing.", "not the asshole sounds like noones ever put her in check best of luck to u and husband and en route baby", "ESH. Neither you, your sister-in-law, her husband, or yours have any standing here. Your MIL will decide what to do with whatever money she leaves at the end of her life. If the four of you can get along no better than illustrated in this post, then just stop interacting.", "I say NTA. You got upset when they said they can't wait for your MIL to pass away, so they can get her money. Understandable.", "NTA\n\nMost likely she so casually vented about MIL dying expecting you'd jump in agreeing with her, like her husband probably does.

Not knowing the disabilities you mentioned, I just hope the disparity in treatment growing up til now is justified and righteous, and not a matter of favoritism (under which the BIL's resentment may be valid).", "NTA. Your SIL talks a lot of ignorant shit and it might be better to not take her words as being what her husband thinks until he says it to your face.  Her vocal calculations that her husband will receive a larger share (or all of it) of the estate because she popped out more babies is disgusting. Thing is, I have heard of parents doing that - listing the grandchildren as equal heirs along with the children.  Think carefully before you encourage your child to have a warm relationship with someone who hates his father.", "NTA\n\nIf your MIL is alive, I would have her clarify her intentions very well with an estate lawyer.  Be sure to tell her what your BIL's wife said.    Make sure, if your MIL agrees, they  get as little as possible.  \n\nIdeally, they wouldn't get a dime.  But maybe in practice, if they get a tiny token amount, it would be enough so they couldn't contest the will.  That would be worth it.\n\nIANAL but I didn't think \"number of grandkids provided\" was a factor in how much one could legally **demand** from a family member, despite a will.\n\nYou are 100% right.  It **is** her husband's job to provide for the family, since I'm assuming she is a SAHM.  She is being a complete AH, as is your BIL.   Honestly, I wouldn't expect a thing from them and would not do one thing for them, ever again.  I'd go permanent NC, actually.", "ESH Stop trying to force a relationship. It's not beneficial to anyone. \"For the sake of the kids\" You aren't a couple who split up and coparent kids.", "NTA wishing someone would die so they could get the money to live off of? How rude! MIL will decide what's done with her money and possessions. The SIL has no standing at all to try and contest things when she does pass. I understand you would like a sort of truce for the kids sake but speaking from experience it's just best to keep toxic out of your life and your future daughters too. Worry about your family. Spouse baby and MIL. Those who are just negative take so much out of you. It will drain you so fast. Not good for your little one. Take care and good luck with little one \ud83d\udc95", "Girl this is so not about the inheritance.\n\nESH. BIL & SIL for obvious reasons, and you for being super cagey about 95% of the context which screams missing missing reasons.", "ESH. Your SIL & you should not be talking about what your MIL is leaving anyone. That\u2019s your MIL\u2019s business, not yours. You should immediately get out of any conversation about that as soon as it starts. You should not try to force anyone to be in your child\u2019s life, no matter how they\u2019re related. \n\nI\u2019ve read your comments. You don\u2019t seem to understand how the childhood dynamic of each parent picking a child to favor over the other affected BIL. BIL wasn\u2019t born hating & resenting his mom. He quite likely got that way after growing up with a mom with a favored child who wasn\u2019t him. My guess is their dad started this by being awful to your husband because he was autistic & mom then felt like she had to defend your husband & take care of him by herself. So she spent the vast majority of her time & attention on your husband. It sucks to be the child in this situation. I think if you understood what that situation was like for BIL as a child, you wouldn\u2019t be as harsh on adult BIL as you are. \n\nThe other thing I don\u2019t think you understand is that a lot of the time, kids don\u2019t experience their parents\u2019 wills as being just about money. The money is a proxy war for love. If mom leaves twice as much to kid X as to kid Y, that means on some level, mom loves kid X twice as much as she loved kid Y. That level wouldn\u2019t be very deep in this case, since MIL appears to have spent BIL\u2019s whole life showing him that she cared more about his brother than about him.", "ESH\n\nLiterally everyone.  You for forcing a relationship to begin with, some relationships can't be fixed. SIL for being nasty, MIL and FIL for showing blatant favoritism towards their children.

Uncles, aunts, and cousins are not vital relationships and it's not punishing kids to let this connection with those unfortunate people drop completely.

As far as it goes for BIL I unfortunately went through a similar life as him so I know what it's like to have one parent love my sibling more than me. BIL and I have had numerous conversations about it and he had asked me how I had healed from it and I told him. I also told him that it takes time to heal and I have even spoken to my husband about trying to understand his BIL more.

Your BIL picked up on the way his autistic brother was treated by FIL, and so came to view him as inferior, or less worthy of attention and love.  Once your FIL was no longer there, resentment grew for the person he saw as inferior being treated equally to him.  He's doubling down on his father's behaviour by cutting his brother/your husband, and family, out of his life.  The last communication, from your SIL may have been triggered by the fact that you are having a baby.  If they really believed they were due inheritance based on number of offspring, you starting a family with his brother becomes a threat to 'their' inheritance.

I understand when you really want family, well to be a real family. But the \u2018other side\u2019 have to want the same thing, and there are some warning signs that the way you think -NTA and BIL and SIL think are never going to work as it is. I suspect that what will happen will be as it stands whatever you say and do will be used against you. So expect the will situation to be spun into oblivion. Some people value war, lIke we would value peace. So even though talking to her is the absolute right thing to do, the outcome could be awful. For sure record, also limit information, and stay firm and polite and in control. It sucks but accepting people where they are at, means it\u2019s easier to deal with them appropriately rather than letting them do a deal on us.

I will definitely do that.", "Yes. We tend to get to see the happy smiles on their faces and such when things come together. Plus the kids are happier when everyone is working together. They don't like the arguing in the family and they do ask for us. We do our best to be there the best we can for the kids because it's not the kids fault for the issues that BIL and my husband have so why should they be punished for it.", "Thank you and I already told my husband a while ago that he needs to encourage her to tell them. I think part of the reason why she won't tell them is due to the fact that her son is explosive and has no problems being mentally abusive to everyone including his own wife and kids. I've unfortunately witnessed this happening numerous times and had to step in to protect his wife and kids when they still lived in the same area as us.", "Or it could be that BIL found it difficult to grow up in a family where his parents fought about how the kids were treated. His father, who is now dead, was awful to OP\u2019s husband, and his mother made up for that by favoring OP\u2019s husband over BIL. That kind of ongoing conflict is awful for the kids.

Hope the SIL eventually works with you on that, GL!", "Well that's what he gets. Like I'm sure the hatred of MIL is justified but he's a grown man and therapy exists for a reason.

You hate your mother and expect an inheritance? Hell no", "The information regarding what he thought this MIls will was, BIL said it to my face 2 years ago and I had put him in place right in front of the pastor at the church, MIL, my husband and SIL.

Is your MIL wealthy that they are banking on this money?\n\nI'd give up trying to make peace with them because it seems to be costing you a lot of stress.  It's obvious there's lots of resentment and your BIL needs to get into therapy to resolve all these feelings.  If not, it's not your problem. \n\nEnjoy your family and the baby that's on it's way and leave their anger and resentment behind.  And please do not give them any money.  It's clear they don't want much to do with you so show some self respect and not dish out $ to them", "NTA - They have a right to distribute their estate as they wish. That said it might help if they set some broad expectations. \n\nMy parents could have prevented some bad feelings if they had been clearer about how they set up their estate earlier. Their will declared that their estate was to be divided equally between their 3 children. But they used the Uniform Transfer to Minors (UTMA) to gift liquid assets directly to grandchildren while they were alive. This caused a some sore feelings because the grandchild distribution was 3/2/2 and my parents divided the $ into 3 shares (per adult child) So the parents with 3 kids felt slighted, until years later when they read the will and saw that my parents apportioned the entire estate including the UTMA assets by 3 adult children rather than 7 grandchildren.", "Seems healthier for your kids to not feel that underlying tension. Nothing with your IL's is good for the children at all. Children pick up on things unsaid too. Better to not be involved with them at all. That being said NTA for what you said.

SIL doesn't know how much they'll get, and she and her husband should be investing and making plans to provide for their family as they think of whatever they get from MIL as a bonus, not a guaranteed asset. It's especially terrible to say that they want your MIL to die.\n\nThat said, I am curious about what your husband and BIL's childhoods looked like. It feels like we're not getting the whole story and I'm getting the impression that BIL felt unloved/neglected and has garnered an unhealthy degree of resentment towards your husband thanks to that.", "NTA, you should probably tell your MIL about this", "NTA, but you need to confirm that everything your SIL said was accurate.", "Is your fil still around?

I never got to meet their father.", "Thank you for the correction but idk how to edit the title.", "Where and what jurisdiction allows a court to designate someone's money and property goes if a legally drawn out will is in place? Unless one can prove the will isn't valid due to the mental/health state of the individual who died, the will and desires of the deceased stand.", "I get it. I felt the same way after this all happened.", "It means which brother got the majority of love and care from parents, you said it already, your father-in-law favored your BIL and ignored your husband because of his disability,  your mother-in-law favored or did more for your husband which your BIL hated and lashes out at your husband and his mother still, that is what I am getting from this post.\n\nNTA, you are loving and protective of your husband, kudos to you, however your BIL and SIL sound as though they are two peas in a pod that think alike with immature behavior, you cannot change them, arguing with them is pointless, so as hard as it is just step back and disengage  from arguing with them, because it looks like all hell will break loose when your MIL's will is read (hopefully not for a long time) when she passes, your  husband will need your support and that is when I would say protect him as best you can.", "So, your mil favor your husband all those time as per what am reading from your comments and post? Please correct me if am wrong", "Believe it or not the USA is not the only country in the world. Many countries have minimum amount laws.", "You can\u2019t disinherit children in France unless they consent, for one. In the state of IL a spouse can renounce a will also.", "It would be hilarious if MIL changed the will so BIL's share was in direct trust for his kids. I guess the SIL would leave her imprint in the wall of the courts as she bursts through, KOOL AID man style, contesting the will. Best of luck to you, and happy holidays!", "I totally understand. I plan on letting them both go and dealing with it when the time comes.", "Thank you!", "Yes but I believe that she was doing it initially to balance out the favoritism that their father showed toward my husband's brother. Then once the father passed away the BIL had become overcome with grief and did a lot of things. He did a lot of things to hurt his mother and my husband. I honestly view it as self sabotage to himself and everyone around him. He hasn't stopped since and he won't get any type of help for what's going on with him either.", "Yeah, but\u2026 were they cut out of the will?", "I would honestly have the biggest laugh because they can't contest it if she leaves something for his kids instead of him.", "The only AHs are your mil and fil. They both planted the seed of resentment between the brother's. Your BIL needs help but if he doesn't want it, that's up to him. She is also planning to give your BIL the bare minimum in her will to still show that she favor your husband. She should tell him instead of leaving you and your husband to take the heat.", "MIL gave her son the bare minimum so that he technically can't contest it.", "please consider that your SIL and BIL might recognize themselves in your post, even by accident, and you might be accidentally stirring more trouble with your comment", "Sounds like with a baby his expected gravy train might be coming to an end.", "I understand and I don't think they will come across this because they don't use reddit.", "NTA, your SIL lost me when she said she can't wait for MIL to die. Who thinks that? Even worse, who says that out loud with 0 problems?", "is this MIL dead or alive? does one brother wish she was dead so that he could have a clear sweep at her assets?  \n\nIts surprising how often elderly women are told they are a hinderance , don't need all those assets and their sons / daughters deserve them and its time to shuffle off this mortal coil ...  Nobody ever say this to their father.\n\nWhen this woman dies, then the surving children will have entitlements.  It is never dependant on who had reproduced most successfully !", "NTA Low contact is best here. As you said, there is a lot to unpack here.", "This & I\u2019m kinda hoping the MIL donates all the money to charity!", "A heartless person who doesn't care about anything but themselves.", "MIL is alive. BIL is the one that wishes she was dead so he could have a clean sweep.", "you can't fix stupid", "It sounds like it was very very traumatic for your bil and not so much anyone else? \n\nSeems like a lot of favoritism and poor parenting. \n\nThe bil didn\u2019t find his father deceased, did he?", "Humans are wired to remember negativity more than positivity, so that makes sense. I don't love the entitlement from your in-laws, but I'm starting to worry that there was a lot more behind the scenes. Obviously it's not fair for BIL to blame your husband for their mother's decisions, but I wonder more now about their dynamic growing up.", "BC, Canada. [Wills, Estates and Succession Act](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/09013_01). Part 4. Division 6. There's much more, but it begins:\n\n>Despite any law or enactment to the contrary, if a will-maker dies leaving a will that does not, in the court's opinion, make adequate provision for the proper maintenance and support of the will-maker's spouse or children, the court may, in a proceeding by or on behalf of the spouse or children, order that the provision that it thinks adequate, just and equitable in the circumstances be made out of the will-maker's estate for the spouse or children.\n\nThere is an in depth article covering the reasoning behind this law [here](https://disinherited.com/wills-variation/tribute-the-bc-wills-variation-act/#:~:text=The%20main%20object%20of%20the,to%20be%20interfered%20with%20lightly) - there are real life examples of successful variations about halfway down the page. Now it was written when one of WESA's predecessors, the Will's Variation Act, was still in effect, but [it didn't change much](https://disinherited.com/wills-variation/wesa-8-wesa-and-the-wills-variation-act/).", "You sure as heck can't unfortunately.", "No he didn't find him deceased. My husband did.", "I've been wondering what the true dynamic was for years but unfortunately I only get bits and pieces that actually match up with each other.", "Could you take them out to activities or your home to minimize contact with the in-laws and you?", "I see. Might be something to investigate, if possible. It could help you understand the contention between husband and BIL better to possibly improve the relationship between them. Just remember not to let yourself get suckered into becoming the family therapist/peacekeeper. That there is thankless and exhausting work.", "No we can't unfortunately. The kids will lose out completely due to the BIL and SIL acting the way they act. They will use the kids as a weapon against us.", "Alright. Thank you.", "All you are doing is hurting the children by continuing to interact.  If they don't know about you, they can't miss you.  By giving them something to miss, you are hurting them.  Just stop.", "I have to say that your MIL is an asshole, you admit that your MIL treated her sons unevenly, she gave most of her attention to your husband and as a result, your BIL hates her and resents your husband for it. Because your BIL hates her and treats her accordingly she's effectively disinherited him. Do you see the problem here?  ESH.", "I didn't think about it that way. I was just trying to keep peace to a certain extent so the kids wouldn't get hurt.", "I see the problem on her side and I have verbally said that there is something wrong all the way around. My only thing with the initial problem was asking BIL to not have the kids get involved in the problem that was created by the MIL and FIL. I don't want the kids to have issues with each other because BIL and SIL have an issue with my husband for something that he couldn't control."]}
