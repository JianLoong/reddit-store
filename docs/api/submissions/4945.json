This is my first time posting to reddit so I apologize for it being a lengthy post. My brother in law (30M) and my husband (29M) have always had a strained relationship due to their childhood, how they were raised and their difference in disabilities. This has led to my brother in law having an issue with their mother and constantly talking bad about her to the point where it blatantly shows that he hates her from the bottom of his heart and in turn has a massive amount of hatred for his brother due to their upbringing and such. \n\nOne brother was taken care of more than the other due to the severity of their disabilities. I ended up on the phone with my brother-in -law's wife (31F) who informed me that her husband wants nothing to do with his niece that his brother and I are expecting to be arriving at the beginning of next year . I (28F) always thought that my brother in law and I were on good terms for years since I always asked him not to let the negativity he has for his brother drop down to the child and he agreed that it shouldn't. \n\nNow for some reason he changed his mind and only seems to want to do more harm than good. I just don't understand why the kids have to be hurt in this situation. My brother-in-law and his wife have multiple kids together and my husband has been involved in the children's lives this whole time. \n\nI was also informed by my brother-in laws wife that she can't wait for mother -in -law to pass away so that her husband can receive all of the money from her death since they gave her the most grandkids. I ended up snapping at her saying that it's not the mother -in laws job to provide for her family, it's her husband's and I think that it's very disturbing that her and husband thought that way. I also told her that she has no right to bank on an inheritance that was never hers to begin with. It is only my husband and brother-in laws inheritance. She got upset with me when I pointed out will and estate laws since she seemed to think she had some sort of legal standing in a courtroom to contest a will without her husband. There is so much to unpack and I just don't even know where to start and end. \n\nAITA for snapping on my sister in law about an inheritance that was never rightfully hers to begin with?", "created_utc": 1671275837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zo48lz/aita_for_snapping_on_my_sister_in_law_about_an/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don't have to get drawn into a pointless argument though; next time the topic comes up you can say something like \"that's not how I understand estate laws\" or \"that's really not for me to comment on, that is MIL's business\". \n\nCongrats on the baby on the way and be sure to surround the baby with people who love her/him. If that's not your BIL, (and it doesn't seem like it is), it's much better for the baby if he stays away.\n\nEdited for typos and punctuation.", "NTA. The wife of BIL has no say in this inheritance, and of course neither it's your business. The MIL will decide about the inheritance and if it's going to be split between the two brothers", "NTA. BIL and wife both sound insane. I wonder how much influence her opinion of your MIL there's been in your BIL's opinion and attacks. At this point, I hope your MIL writes BIL out of the will completely. It's not the best outcome for his kids, but that's on him, not on their grandma. In fact, if I were you, I'd start documenting their behavior now. If they do ever try to contest the will, you'll need proof as to why your MIL makes any decision that she does. This awful behavior is a good reason.\n\nCongrats on the baby. You honestly sound better off without them in your lives.", "NTA, but no one rightfully inherits anything just because they are a relative. If a parent has a legal will, s/he can designate where their money/estate goes when they pass. If a parent wants to designate an organization, that's their right.  A child isn't legally entitled to inherit anything by default (unless there is no legally binding will, then laws would dictate how sn inheritance is split). Have the brothers spoken to the parents to see where they stand legally when the parents pass? Perhaps your in-laws will designate the local humane society as their will recipients since it sounds like there's a lot of turmoil brewing in the family and homeless pets would be more grateful.", "NTA. Reading through your answers as well as the original post, your BIL was basically his dad\u2019s golden child and resents the fact that his mother didn\u2019t similarly prioritise him over your husband. The entitlement is breathtaking. And he\u2019s ended up with a wife who matched that sense of entitlement completely.\n\nYou weren\u2019t wrong to tell her that the will was nothing to do with her. She sounds vile. I think sometimes you have to accept that there are people in your life who are toxic. For all that you may want the family harmony, I don\u2019t see what you gain from your child being in contact with your BIL and his wife. \n\nSo congrats on the baby. And good luck building a healthier life with firm boundaries against the toxic sibling and his wife.", "NTA.  Commenting that you can't wait for someone to die is awful, regardless of the circumstances.  You calling out that BS is a good thing.", "not the asshole sounds like noones ever put her in check best of luck to u and husband and en route baby", "ESH. Neither you, your sister-in-law, her husband, or yours have any standing here. Your MIL will decide what to do with whatever money she leaves at the end of her life. If the four of you can get along no better than illustrated in this post, then just stop interacting.", "I say NTA. You got upset when they said they can't wait for your MIL to pass away, so they can get her money. Understandable.", "NTA\n\nMost likely she so casually vented about MIL dying expecting you'd jump in agreeing with her, like her husband probably does. Hopefully it's a wake up call for her that ain't normal (but I doubt it).\n\n>I already know how MIL set up her will unfortunately, they are the only ones who don't know\n\nUh-oh lol prepare for the little cousins' harmony you want to be tested in the future. Not knowing the disabilities you mentioned, I just hope the disparity in treatment growing up til now is justified and righteous, and not a matter of favoritism (under which the BIL's resentment may be valid).", "NTA. Your SIL talks a lot of ignorant shit and it might be better to not take her words as being what her husband thinks until he says it to your face.  Her vocal calculations that her husband will receive a larger share (or all of it) of the estate because she popped out more babies is disgusting. Thing is, I have heard of parents doing that - listing the grandchildren as equal heirs along with the children.  Think carefully before you encourage your child to have a warm relationship with someone who hates his father.", "NTA\n\nIf your MIL is alive, I would have her clarify her intentions very well with an estate lawyer.  Be sure to tell her what your BIL's wife said.    Make sure, if your MIL agrees, they  get as little as possible.  \n\nIdeally, they wouldn't get a dime.  But maybe in practice, if they get a tiny token amount, it would be enough so they couldn't contest the will.  That would be worth it.\n\nIANAL but I didn't think \"number of grandkids provided\" was a factor in how much one could legally **demand** from a family member, despite a will.\n\nYou are 100% right.  It **is** her husband's job to provide for the family, since I'm assuming she is a SAHM.  She is being a complete AH, as is your BIL.   Honestly, I wouldn't expect a thing from them and would not do one thing for them, ever again.  I'd go permanent NC, actually.", "ESH Stop trying to force a relationship. It's not beneficial to anyone. \"For the sake of the kids\" You aren't a couple who split up and coparent kids.", "NTA wishing someone would die so they could get the money to live off of? How rude! MIL will decide what's done with her money and possessions. The SIL has no standing at all to try and contest things when she does pass. I understand you would like a sort of truce for the kids sake but speaking from experience it's just best to keep toxic out of your life and your future daughters too. Worry about your family. Spouse baby and MIL. Those who are just negative take so much out of you. It will drain you so fast. Not good for your little one. Take care and good luck with little one \ud83d\udc95", "Girl this is so not about the inheritance.\n\nESH. BIL & SIL for obvious reasons, and you for being super cagey about 95% of the context which screams missing missing reasons.", "ESH. Your SIL & you should not be talking about what your MIL is leaving anyone. That\u2019s your MIL\u2019s business, not yours. You should immediately get out of any conversation about that as soon as it starts. You should not try to force anyone to be in your child\u2019s life, no matter how they\u2019re related. \n\nI\u2019ve read your comments. You don\u2019t seem to understand how the childhood dynamic of each parent picking a child to favor over the other affected BIL. BIL wasn\u2019t born hating & resenting his mom. He quite likely got that way after growing up with a mom with a favored child who wasn\u2019t him. My guess is their dad started this by being awful to your husband because he was autistic & mom then felt like she had to defend your husband & take care of him by herself. So she spent the vast majority of her time & attention on your husband. It sucks to be the child in this situation. I think if you understood what that situation was like for BIL as a child, you wouldn\u2019t be as harsh on adult BIL as you are. \n\nThe other thing I don\u2019t think you understand is that a lot of the time, kids don\u2019t experience their parents\u2019 wills as being just about money. The money is a proxy war for love. If mom leaves twice as much to kid X as to kid Y, that means on some level, mom loves kid X twice as much as she loved kid Y. That level wouldn\u2019t be very deep in this case, since MIL appears to have spent BIL\u2019s whole life showing him that she cared more about his brother than about him.", "ESH\n\nLiterally everyone.  You for forcing a relationship to begin with, some relationships can't be fixed. SIL for being nasty, MIL and FIL for showing blatant favoritism towards their children. BIL for counting all his chickens before they hatch regarding inheritance money. \n\nBTW if they're not getting anything I would try to convince MIL to tell them because if they find out later I can only imagine the hell BIL will put your family through.", "NTA.", "ESH.  Uncles, aunts, and cousins are not vital relationships and it's not punishing kids to let this connection with those unfortunate people drop completely.  But speculating on the contents of the will was unseemly for all of you.  Your SIL's s lack of standing is irrelevant because it would have been just as bad if it were the brothers", "Which brother got the lions share of love and support?", "ESH,\n\nBickering about an inheritance only MIL has something to say about.\n\nBut extra AH-points to your SIL for saying she can't wait fur her MaiL to die...", "NTA but you gotta let the relationship go. If they don't want to play a role in their niece's life, not a problem.", "ESH no one is entitled to your MIL's money when she passes away, including your husband and BIL. For all you know she's going to give it all away to charity, and that is her right if she wants to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

For some stupid reason all her and her husband seem to think is my husband and I are a walking checkbook for them.", "The BIL resentment is due to the fact that his brother is autistic and he isn't. That is literally 60% of his hatred. He is mad because more time had to put into his brother when it came to their mother but with their father it was the polar opposite. BIL got all of their fathers love while my husband didn't. Their father wanted nothing to do with my husband because of his disability.", "I have heard of that too that's why I had thought she was insane when she said it. Plus due to the toxicity that both BIL and SIL have shown MIL throughout the years she doesn't really do much for the kids anymore like she used to. So I honestly wonder why she seems to think she should obtain so much more. I honestly don't understand her logic.", "I gotcha. I actually plan on taking my self down the road to her house to talk to her about it today since it's been said. I also informed my husband that I have to talk to my BIL about not wanting to be involved with his niece bit and then my husband and I will figure it out from there.

I wasn't even trying to bring that topic up. She did and I did try my best to exit out of it. I don't have any intention of having a conversation with my SIL about MIl's will because as far as I am concerned it was never my business from the get go and I even told both my husband and MIL that when they discussed it in front of me. As far as it goes for BIL I unfortunately went through a similar life as him so I know what it's like to have one parent love my sibling more than me. BIL and I have had numerous conversations about it and he had asked me how I had healed from it and I told him. I also told him that it takes time to heal and I have even spoken to my husband about trying to understand his BIL more. Also, my situation with my parents is so bad that I am not even written in their will because they don't even consider me their child due to their own issues with me.", "I already have an idea and I've been trying to tell my husband for a long time to prepare for a nasty drawn out fight behind all of this.

Don't allow these discussions to occur in your presence as it sounds like a toxic mess.  Be grateful to not have them involved in your future child's life. Family or not, toxicity has no place in your life especially as a new parent. Congratulations on your baby. Wishing you peace and happiness in the remainder of your pregnancy as well as good health for you and your baby.", "It would be wise to keep your mouth more firmly shut. Your SIL and BIL may interpret what you have already said as meaning that they have been cut out of the will, and that you have been briefed on this by your MIL or husband.", "That's very wise.  When the time comes, your job is to be your husband's support system.", "Do any good outcomes result from doing things for the \"sake of the kids?\"", "It seems that your BIL learnt from your FIL an unhealthy attitude towards autism.  Your BIL picked up on the way his autistic brother was treated by FIL, and so came to view him as inferior, or less worthy of attention and love.  Once your FIL was no longer there, resentment grew for the person he saw as inferior being treated equally to him.  He's doubling down on his father's behaviour by cutting his brother/your husband, and family, out of his life.  The last communication, from your SIL may have been triggered by the fact that you are having a baby.  If they really believed they were due inheritance based on number of offspring, you starting a family with his brother becomes a threat to 'their' inheritance.  If you and your husband know the contents of the MIL's Will, then it's only fair that they do too, so your husband should encourage his mother to have the same chat with them so that the air is cleared, and their are no nasty surprises for them when she passes.\n\nNTA", "Parents failed both their sons :(", "Honestly, that sounds like you are doing the right thing for your child.\n\nIf your BIL and his wife are upset, well, that's 100% their issue.\n\nBest of luck.", "Hi, after looking at all this- please just be careful.  I understand when you really want family, well to be a real family. But the \u2018other side\u2019 have to want the same thing, and there are some warning signs that the way you think -NTA and BIL and SIL think are never going to work as it is. I suspect that what will happen will be as it stands whatever you say and do will be used against you. So expect the will situation to be spun into oblivion. Some people value war, lIke we would value peace. So even though talking to her is the absolute right thing to do, the outcome could be awful. For sure record, also limit information, and stay firm and polite and in control. It sucks but accepting people where they are at, means it\u2019s easier to deal with them appropriately rather than letting them do a deal on us.  All the best, after 25+yrs girl I could tell you some tales about my SIL that would make your hair fall out!  Nah but realizing that even though I wanted a sister she didn\u2019t actually made it so much easier. I didn\u2019t have to pretend she was being nicer than she is, and not having previous expectations means I can be free to Just treat every moment on its merit. \ud83d\ude18", "I think that's for the best. Their relationship was never gonna get better because of the resentment fostered from childhood. The real people at fault are MIL and FIL for their favoritism. They set the boys relationship up for failure from the start. \n\nSo OP I'm just being noisy. Are they not getting anything or just not as much as they think? I'm invested in this story, this is now my BIL and SIL being AHs \ud83d\ude02", "Until she dies the inheritance should be of no importance, not for you nor for your husband and BIl/SIL.\n\nDon't like your MIl? Stay away, be polite.\n\nYou do like your MIL? Be there, have a healthy relationship with her.\n\nAfter she eventually dies, you'll all know who gets what and I it really isn't fair you can always rebalance by gifting to the other son.", "Everyone sucks here", "Thank you so much and I definitely plan on it.", "Alright. I will definitely do that.", "Yes. We tend to get to see the happy smiles on their faces and such when things come together. Plus the kids are happier when everyone is working together. They don't like the arguing in the family and they do ask for us. We do our best to be there the best we can for the kids because it's not the kids fault for the issues that BIL and my husband have so why should they be punished for it.", "Thank you and I already told my husband a while ago that he needs to encourage her to tell them. I think part of the reason why she won't tell them is due to the fact that her son is explosive and has no problems being mentally abusive to everyone including his own wife and kids. I've unfortunately witnessed this happening numerous times and had to step in to protect his wife and kids when they still lived in the same area as us.", "Or it could be that BIL found it difficult to grow up in a family where his parents fought about how the kids were treated. His father, who is now dead, was awful to OP\u2019s husband, and his mother made up for that by favoring OP\u2019s husband over BIL. That kind of ongoing conflict is awful for the kids. It can make them both feel like they\u2019re not good enough for the parent who\u2019s championing the other kid & generally make them angry at the whole family.", "I do agree but I am doing my best with my husband because in my opinion he's not a failure. He's a survivor.", "Thank you.", "Thank you and I understand.", "Lmao. BIL is getting the bare minimum that the state allows and that's about it. My husband gets everything else because he has proven to be more responsible than his brother in multiple ways... Past and present actions unfortunately.", "I agree and I normally try to stay out of stuff like this but I guess I realize now my BIL's wife baited me into this by first telling me that her husband wants nothing to do with future niece.", "Just to be clear, I didn't say your husband's a failure :O and he's lucky to have a wife working to bring some family together as much as possible, instead of driving the wedge further. Hope the SIL eventually works with you on that, GL!", "Well that's what he gets. Like I'm sure the hatred of MIL is justified but he's a grown man and therapy exists for a reason. He can't treat someone like shit most of his adult life, wish death upon them and still expect to get their money.", "Oh yeah, that's even worse if she actually believes her husband will inherite most of it...\n\nAre you sure your BILsaid that? Maybe your siL is just evil...", "Oh. I'm sorry. I wasn't insinuating that you said it. I just wrote it the way I did so it wasn't misinterpreted the wrong way.", "Exactly! You hate your mother and expect an inheritance? Hell no", "The information regarding what he thought this MIls will was, BIL said it to my face 2 years ago and I had put him in place right in front of the pastor at the church, MIL, my husband and SIL.  Honestly Idk if he said he refused to be involved with his niece but something tells me this may not be a lie since he said little negative remarks my whole pregnancy so far about the child and his brother."]}
