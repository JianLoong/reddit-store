The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOH\"s dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories. \n\nI have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice.\n\nShe said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more \"girly\". I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOH\"s dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black. \n\nI paid for all the dresses. \n\nFast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool.\n\nSo fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation. \n\nI confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend. \n\nThe wedding went on and it was truly amazing.\n\nEver since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back.

She agreed to wear the dress you picked out, and then deceitfully planned to change at the last moment in the hope that you'd just let her get away with it. She knew that you would tell her no.\n\nThink of being in a wedding as like playing a part in a play, or a ballet, or something. You get cast as \"bridesmaid\", so you wear the costume that the artistic director has picked out for bridesmaids to wear. If you don't want to wear the costume, don't be in the show. But you can't just show up on opening night and say \"I didn't like your costume choices, so I'm going to wear the same costume as this other character instead\".", "NTA\n\nYour \"friend\" clearly tried to wait until the very last moment to put on the other dress in the hopes you wouldn't make a scene and she could have her way.\n\nIt's a wedding, its about the people getting married, your own taste doesn't matter, especially given the bride paid for the dresses, something not all brides are kind enough to do.\n\nTrying to wait until the last moment to manipulate the bride is a massive AH move.", "NTA. Just as you can't force her to wear anything she doesn't want to wear, you don't have to have her at your wedding. She lied about changing later, lied about why the new dress was there and acted a fool. I would NEVER give her the money she spent for the dress. She loved the dress so much so she can have it forever and wear it for a different occasion.  Anyone saying you're an AH or you need to pay for the dress is an AH and can pay for her new pretty black dress.  What a bunch of idiots! Get better friends.", "NTA \n\nyou paid for the dress she was supposed to wear as a bridesmaid so if she\u2019s out money then that\u2019s her problem. She had no need to buy another dress. Winter themed wedding with forest green bridesmaids and gold accessories sounds absolutely beautiful. Block her and move on, she embarrassed herself behaving the way she did and clearly waited till the last minute to spring the black dress on you assuming you\u2019d roll over and let her do what she wanted, she only had to wear it for the ceremony and pictures really then could have changed and if she couldn\u2019t manage that then your probably better off without her as a friend", "NTA - it is your wedding. IF she didn't want to wear the color that you chose she could have easily politely backed out and said she would love to attend as a guest but wasn't comfortable wearing that color. You also paid for the dress not her where many would complain that they are buying a dress they will never wear again...you purchased it.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand how people seem to think they can override the bride & groom\u2019s wishes at their own wedding. Calling security kinda seems like overkill but she was causing a scene & yelling obscenities so I think it was warranted. Seems like she was determined to cause issues at your wedding. I don\u2019t think you owe her anything. She owes you an apology for trying to cause issues at your wedding. It was your day and I\u2019m glad it was amazing for you!", "\"Your a horrible and inconsiderate friend\" says the person who was told REPEATEDLY told the colors were forest green and gold. The same person who asked if they could wear a different color and was politely told NO THANK YOU! \n\nI think Kat forgot that the wedding wasn't about her. You asked her nicely twice to put the bridesmaid dress that EVERYONE (except the MOH was wearing) and and told her the consequences. She rolled the dice and lost. She is not a very good friend and fuck anyone for saying otherwise. I bet a thousand internet dollars that if the wedding was for the people giving you shit they'd be singing a different tune right now.\n\nIOW NTA.", "NTA. Holy crap this is the 1st time I've read where the bridesmaid went full bridesmaidzilla! You owe her NO money as she refused to wear the dress you actually paid for. I'd honestly let her just go... she's not a very good friend at all since she forgot your wedding is about you and your hubby not how she looks in a dress.", "NTA - If she had such a problem with the dress then she could have backed out of being a bridesmaid. Then she could have attended as a guest and worn whatever she wanted. And no, you don't have to pay for a dress that you told her not to buy in the first place.", "NTA and WTF\n\nWhat type of friend is this bridesmaid to act like this, to fight you on your wedding day and to disrespect you you after you paid for a dress already? Sounds toxic\n\nI am glad that you still had a blast of a wedding, kudos for bot letting it ruin your wedding!", "NTA. \n\nYour friend is toxic and wanted to make the day all about her. It seems she either has jealousy issues or a narcissist personality. It was your day, not hers.\n\nDid you pay for her black dress? No? Then there's no reason at all to pay her back. She made her decision to be difficult. Don't bow down.", "NTA , she fucked around and found out. If she cared about you in the slightest she wouldn\u2019t have tried that trick she did lying about the dress and when she was gonna wear it. She deserved to be embarrassed. I get not wanting to wear a specific color but it\u2019s your wedding no one cares if she looks flattering or not if she had such a problem with it she should of told you she didn\u2019t want to be a bridesmaid anymore", "NTA- you paid for the dress she agreed to wear. She tried to set the terms of YOUR wedding. She is no friend.", "NTA If you're going to be a bridesmaid, you have to be prepared to do what the bride wants. Kat should have declined and just gone as a guest. And no, you don't owe her anything. If anything, she owes you for the green dress that you bought that she refused to wear.", "NTA\nWho makes such a scene on somebody else's wedding? You told her the rules, you paid for the dress, and even my terminally annoyed with bridesmaids and moh dramas person can't find any fault with you.", "NTA. She could have told you straight out she wasn't wearing it beforehand but she held off until the actual day-of, when she thought you couldn't refuse. You called her bluff. \n\nAlso, she can return the black dress!", "Kat needs to take a flying leap. NTA", "You're absolutely NTA here, and she should reimburse you for the forest green dress you bought for her that ended up not being worn.", "NTA\n\nIf she truly couldn't handle the dress, then she shouldn't have stayed a bridesmaid.  She could have just asked to be demoted to a guest.  Instead she lied, then tried to force the issue.  She wasted her own money by being stubborn and made a spectacle of herself.   You weren't even harsh by kicking her out.  She was told what the consequences of her actions would be and she accepted them in the mistaken belief that you were bluffing and would just give in to her.  If the other bridesmaids feel bad for her, that can let her railroad thier own wedding.  Honestly, considering her attitude from the get go and the temper tantrums, this seems like a person best cut off from your life anyway.", "NTA. She could have just dropped out of bridesmaid and went as a regular guest if she didn\u2019t like it that much. Also green looks amazing at winter weddings. Congrats!", "NTA.  Usually I'd say kick her from the bridal party but stay for the day, however she let you spend money on a dress she had no intention of wearing and was behaving totally unhinged at being called out for her clear childish behavior", "NTA.\n\nShe knew what was expected of her, and you even told her that black is not in the cards for her as a color. \n\nShe didn't tell you on purpose that she would buy a black dress and waited until the pictures to pressure you into accepting it. None of this is on you. Good that she's blocked, I hope it stays that way.", "What was harsh was her pulling that crap minutes before you get married. Block her !", "NTA. Oh my god when will people stop making things about themselves, it was YOUR wedding, if she didn't like the dress then she shouldn't have attended.\n\nYou had every right to kick her out op.", "NTA - if she didn\u2019t like the colors and felt that strongly she should have backed out and said no.  Otherwise suck it up and wear the color you may not like as women have done for years!  Lol.  I mean I am a fair-skinned, redhead and a friend was obsessed with orange so down the aisle looking like a dreamsicle I went!", "NTA-your wedding wasn\u2019t about her. You bought the dress, so she wasn\u2019t out anything for a dress she didn\u2019t like. You were fine with her changing for the reception. She could have sucked it up for the ceremony and pictures.\n\nI\u2019ve been a bridesmaid a few times. I literally don\u2019t care what the bride wants me to wear, I\u2019ll wear it. I\u2019m there to make her day easier, I\u2019ll buy and wear what the bride wants. It\u2019s half a day at most. \n\nIf she can\u2019t deal with not looking her best for a friend, well, she needs to learn she isn\u2019t the main character or the centre of the universe.", "NTA. \n\nI am a woman who isn't particularly interested in weddings and all the stuff around them, but I've been a bridesmaid and I'm also a decent human being. If she was so opposed to forest green (your wedding theme sounds lovely, by the way) she could have just backed out of being a bridesmaid. But of course, she wanted the spotlight of being part of the wedding, without being a good friend and just wearing the green dress. \n\nGood for you for kicking her out, and no, you don't owe her a dime for her dress. Send her a bill for the green dress that she let you buy when she had no intention of wearing it.", "NTA. I looked horrid in yellow, it\u2019s an absolute no go on me. But if one of my best friends wanted me to wear yellow, I\u2019d suck it up for a day.", "NTA - you set the dress code for the bridal party. She went out of her way to not abide by it and then demands YOU pay for the dress she wasn\u2019t even supposed to buy lmao. She embarrassed herself and showed that she cares more about herself than you. \n\nGood on you for kicking her out and blocking her lol.\n\n**she should pay YOU back for the dress YOU paid for her to wear originally**", "NTA- you paid for her dress. She decided to do her own thinh. Is she going to pay you back for the money you spent on her?", "NTA-I have been in a couple weddings and didn't care for one of the dresses I was asked to wear, but it was her wedding, not mine and I wanted to support her on her day, so I wore it with pride for her.  \n\nShe went against what you requested over and over again, not much of a friend if you ask me.", "NTA, bet those other bridesmaids wouldn\u2019t be saying the same if you did exactly this at her wedding. When they bring it up, you just need to respond with \u2018okay, well in that case we can all ignore dress codes for all your future events, right?\u2019", "Nta", "NTA - clearly you\u2019re not in the wrong here. You even paid for the dress! If the dress you\u2019d asked her to wear was extreme enough she didn\u2019t want to wear it, she should have removed herself from the wedding on the dress shopping day, not freestyled it on your actual wedding day. I\u2019d bill her for the wasted dress you paid for and she didn\u2019t wear.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding. Your bridesmaids. You get to pick the colors, regardless of what they think. The audacity of that woman to try to change things to her benefit at the last minute shows you how she planned for all of this to work. She put the black dress on under the radar, hoping you wouldn't notice, after having told you it's only for the reception/after the ceremony and pictures.", "NTA. She\u2019s rude and entitled af. Cut her off", "NTA\n\nYou paid for the bridesmaid dresses, nobody told her to buy another dress.  You told her several times that this was your colors.  I would've kicked her ass out too.  \n\nI had to kick one of my bridesmaids out the day of my wedding due to her husband calling me names but this chick had the nerve to call me later and ask can she come by to pick up her dress that I paid for.  I still have that dress along with my wedding dress together.", "NTA.   I cannot believe this sh*t really happens,", "Pfffft, no, NTA.\n\nYou laid it out clearly to Kat about the colors for your wedding, bought the dresses, and she showed up anyway and put on that black dress at the last minute on purpose as a big middle finger to you. Screw that. It's hilarious that she's calling YOU awful names after she tried to pull this crap AT YOUR WEDDING, literally as you're walking to the ceremony. \n\nShe was never your friend, and the people that are getting on your case need to back off. You're not the problem here, but Kat DEFINITELY is.", "NTA in the slightest.\n\nYour friend's concerns and eventual outburst all seem to stem from how she thought **she** would look during you and your partner's celebration. That is the *last* thing someone should care about on their friend's wedding day. \n\nOn top of it all, you were gracious enough to purchase all the dresses for them. Kat's selfish attitude, her untimeliness to your wedding, and the way she treated you that day/how she is texting you now is uncalled for. \n\nCongratulations on your wedding, and may you and your partner have many happy years together :)", "Kat is a walking disaster. \n\nAs a wedding planner, I will say I am truly very sorry that you had to deal with that right before walking down the aisle. Anyone who purposely creates unnecessary drama at another person\u2019s wedding goes right out the door! Ignore Kat... she will never see or own the fact that she was the only one responsible for all her own problems.", "NTA. She should pay you back for the dress you bought for her. What she did was utterly selfish. The wedding was about you not her. If she had such a problem she could have refused to be a bridesmaid. I guess she isn't really much of a friend. Drop her.", "NTA. \nJeez Kat is a massive drama llama and wanted your wedding to be about her because god forbid people think about someone other than her. \n\nI\u2019m curious about the other bridesmaids and if they\u2019re saying you were being harsh because they think what Kat did was fine, or if they think it\u2019s easier to just let her get away with what she wants.", "NTA if the dress was that much of an issue she should\u2019ve declined being a bridesmaid. She did this because she just assumed you would roll with it. Yeah she would be dead to me.", "Ha ha, no NTA\n\nanyone who sides with her needs to be cut off as well.\n\nSHE wanted to be a bridesmaid. So SHE had to follow the theme. YOU paid for the dress she was to wear. You don't own she anything for the dress she bought. That's on her.\n\n YOUR wedding wasn't about her or her likes.", "NTA It\u2019s your wedding, if she really didn\u2019t like the dress color choice she could\u2019ve bowed out early on. You paid for the green dress so why should you pay her for the black dress she bought? Your other bridesmaids should respect your wishes in this matter. It sounds like you might want to shop for some new friends.", "NTA - Kat knew what the bridesmaids dress was. She acted like an entitled selfish brat, and seemed very surprised you didn't let her do it. I imagine she's used to people enabling her. Good for you, you didn't let her stain your experience.\n\nYou owe her nothing. She's actually the one owing you the money you put for her dress.", "Bridesmaids are supposed to be friends that love you enough to wear ruffled peach and seafoam green dresses. She isn't your friend. She's a narcissist and an attention seeker. She got the attention, and you got to be married without her, so everyone wins. \n\nWell played. I hope the videographer got a good shot of her being dragged out. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou paid for the dress. She agreed to be your bridesmaid, knowing that the dress was forest green. She was a jerk here and so rude.", "NTA - she started kicking off and no one needs that at their wedding. Removing her was a smart move.", "NTA you explicitly told her no she cannot wear black as that\u2019s what the MOH is wearing. You were upfront when going to buy the dress and you paid for it. She just decided that on your wedding day it should be about her. \nI have worn plenty of awful brides maid dresses. One of which was awful colors. my cousins wedding colors for the bridesmaids dress was burgundy and lime green. She bought the dress and I just wore that awful colored dress the whole day. Oh and get this one of the bridesmaids took my dress and I was a size 6 at the time and the dress that was left for me was a size 16. I didn\u2019t bother to throw a fit because the wedding isn\u2019t about the bridesmaids it\u2019s the bride and groom. I made it work sure I looked like I was swimming in that dress oh well. \ud83d\ude06 I think she could do that for you. Forrest green and gold is beautiful btw.\nEdit to add: you shouldn\u2019t pay for her black dress. She chose to do that on her own.", "NTA - Kat is a bad friend, full stop.", "NTA. \n\nYou paid for the dress you wanted her to wear. She was under no illusions about what she was supposed to wear. It doesn't sound like there was any ambiguity here at all.  She decided to ignore you and buy a different dress. That's her problem. If it was bad enough that she refused to wear it, she should have pulled out of the bridal party.", "NTA \nShe asked if she could wear another color, you said no and she wore black anyway. Plus she showed up late and lied when you asked what dress she had brought with her. If she was so against forest green, she could've just declined being a bridesmaid in the first place. Instead she decided to try and make your wedding all about her. I'm glad you managed to have her escorted out before the ceremony, I would have too. But... who has security in their wedding? Just curious", "NTA. She's an entitled jerk", "NTA, and it sounds like your 'friends' are unhappy about not getting to wear the black dress as well.  Sorry girls, being the bridesmaid means you have to wear the ugly dress sometimes.", "BIG NTA Also, why are you letting her harass you? She knew the color. I am also not understanding any other bridesmaids siding with her or giving you crap. She knew the color palette, and purposefully tried to get you to change your mind on your wedding day.", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t want to play by the rules, she should have stepped down from her role as bridesmaid.", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe her anything, you already paid for her bridesmaids dress. You explicitly told her it was the only dress she was to wear, chose a different dress, that's entirely on her.", "NTA - she purchased the dress on her own after you had bought the one she was to wear.  She should have withdrawn from being a bridesmaid if the dress was so intolerable to her.  Instead, she tried to do an end run and do what she wanted.  You weren\u2019t putting up with it and had her removed from the premises.\n\nShe is just mad her plan didn\u2019t work.  She didn\u2019t think you were going to do anything as it was almost time for the ceremony to start.\n\nIf you had allowed her to stay, would she still expect you to reimburse you for the dress?  How about you asking for reimbursement or return of the original dress?", "NTA bride picks the colors. You even paid for the dress. She has nothing to complain about. You even said she could change after pictures were over. We\u2019ve all been bridesmaids in a wedding where the color didn\u2019t flatter us. But it isn\u2019t about us, it\u2019s about the look the bride wanted.", "Makes me giggle at the overwhelming NTA response and I couldn't agree more.\n\nWhat surprises me that, since not a single iota of any redditors think you might be the AH, why your mates are saying YTA??\nTime to rethink how close you want to be to those friends too, if I were you.", "Nta you set a dress code for the event. She went against the dress code, and she expects you to be responsible for her decisions?", "NTA!\n\nOkay first of all, that girl is not a friend.\nSecondly forest green is a lovely colour! \nThirdly why are the other bridesmaids defending her? She turned up purposefully wearing the wrong dress and told you to fuck off at your WEDDING. \n\nYou may need to reevaluate your friendship group.\n\nCongratulations on your marriage and glad it didn\u2019t spoil your day.", "NTA.  She FA&FO", "NTA at all. If she really didn\u2019t want to wear forest green she could have declined to be a bridesmaid, worn her choice of colour, and still enjoyed your wedding and your friendship.", "NTA. She embarrassed herself snd disrespected the bride\u2019s wishes. It doesn\u2019t matter how ugly she thinks the dress is, she needs to wear it. That\u2019s the job! She didn\u2019t even pay for it. Bridesmaid is the AH.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Kat sounds terrible.  Bullet dodged.  Who needs a friend like that?", "NTA She was underhanded and sneaky. She could have refused to wear the green when you were dress shopping and you would have been able to make a decision at that time with what to do. She overstepped majorly by disregarding your wishes on your wedding day. Majorly disrespectful.\n\nAs for the dress. You didn't choose the black dress and she didn't check with you before buying so she can eat the cost. You should charge her for the cost of the green dress because it is because of her that it was not used, and the money you spent on it was wasted.", "NTA. Kinda curious as to the style though. But yeah if she'd said the style was flattering that's one thing but the colour isn't her business lmao.", "Nta. If I'm in a wedding and they want me to wear a garbage bag--- imma wear a garbage bag. She wasn't listening to your wishes and didn't respect your choice. You owe her no money and she can gtfo. nta!", "NTA. When you agree to be a bridemaid you know you don't get to pick the colour, etc. Its part of the deal. So you paid for a green dress she never wore? I'd want my money back for that dress.", "NTA\n\nAll eyes should be on the brides...not the odd bridesmaid out! Besides, your day, your vision. \n\nCongrats on your marriage!", "NTA what an insane thing to pull. How did she expect this to go down other than being kicked out? I cut her and anyone who defends her out of my life with a smile. You were completely justified, and I am a very casual wedding person.", "NTA.  She is not your friend.", "NTA. She knew your color themes and if she's that insecure about looking bad on NOT her day she could have gracefully bowed out. She sounds like extra drama", "NTA\n\nShe\u2019s right in that you can\u2019t force her to wear anything, but it is absolutely within your right to excuse her from the wedding party if she refuses to wear the dress you picked out and even more so for being insulting and unruly.\n\nShe is the one who chose to spend money on the dress. You do not owe her any compensation. If anything, she owes you for the dress you spent your own money on that she chose not to wear.\n\nI\u2019m glad that, despite all of this, your wedding was amazing. I think forest green is a beautiful winter color. Cheers to a happy marriage. \ud83e\udd42 \ud83d\udc99", "Ummm. A huge fat NTA. She knew what the dress was going to be. You paid for the bridesmaids dresses, so she really has no say. She LIES to you when questioned about the dress in the bag she turns up with, then sneakily puts on the dress she wants to wear right before your ceremony?! She is no friend at all, she deserved to be escorted out! In fact, kudos to you for doing that!! I don\u2019t know why your friends are defending her.", "NTA she knew she was in the wrong and that's why she was late and waited till the end. But she also thought you would just suck it up. Good for you for kicking her out. \n\nShe's not a good friend and to anyone that complains say you told her you would call security and she continued to scream and misbehave \n\nIt's the classic f around and find out", "NTA at allllll. Wow", "NTA. Part of the deal with being a bridesmaid is that you wear the dress the bride asks you to, even if it\u2019s ugly (there\u2019s a reason this is a whole trope). If she wasn\u2019t willing to do that, she should have declined being a bridesmaid.", "NTA. Do not give her a dime and no not listen to anyone trying to excuse her behavior. It was your wedding. You chose the colors AND paid for the dresses. She should have declined participating if she did not want to wear the color you chose.", "NTA, and honestly WTF with anyone taking her side. She agreed to be your bridesmaid. She knew the color. You paid for her dress. She disrespected you by wearing something you *explicitly* told her not to wear and by trying to sneak it in by walking downstairs at the last minute. She then refused to change and yelled expletives at you. I\u2019d have told her to GTFO the second she snuck down the stairs. Was *security* dragging her out over the top? Not at the expense of her ruining you day it wasn\u2019t.", "NTA she's an ass and she knows it", "NTA. My friend picked the most unflattering color for my skin tone for our bridesmaid dresses ( ironically white, but that was her vision.) I dyed my hair red and sucked it up...it's what you do for friends.", "NTA \npersonally i think it wouldnt have been that hard to just wear the dress for a friend. if there had been an issue eg it was giving rashes or marks, then thats a different story. i wouldnt be happy with her.", "NTA it was your day! If she was a real friend regardless if she liked it or not she would have worn the dress. Honestly it\u2019s her fault for spending money on another dress as you told her already she couldn\u2019t wear black.", "Nta.  She could have worn the dress you bought for her or kindly stepped back from being in the wedding.  She was being sneaky and tried to pull one over on you.   Do not give her the money back for the dress.  She made the choice to buy it so you are not responsible for her choices", "Lmao so she asked to be a bridesmaid and then didn\u2019t want to follow the dress code? Tf lmao \n\nNTA", "NTA.

The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOH\"s dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories. \n\nI have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice.\n\nShe said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more \"girly\". I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOH\"s dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black. \n\nI paid for all the dresses. \n\nFast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool.\n\nSo fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation. \n\nI confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend. \n\nThe wedding went on and it was truly amazing.\n\nEver since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back. AITA for kicking her out?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s so pretty and different\u2026ugh if i have to see another blush colored bridesmaid dress I may scream lol \n\n\nYears ago my cousin had that as her bridesmaids colors and I always remembered it (I was just a kid) .

You had a specific vision, you paid for the dresses, you gave her the opportunity to back down and she decided not to.

She was the problem, not you.", "NTA! Get rid of her. She isn't true friend. She was obviously jealous the spotlight wasn't on her and threw a fit when she didn't get her way.

You had every right to kick her out. You don't owe her anything. She knew she wasn't supposed to wear black, but she did it anyway. That's her prize for doing something stupid.
