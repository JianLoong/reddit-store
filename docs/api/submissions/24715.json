He didn\u2019t need to worry because they welcomed me into their family and were overjoyed that their son had found someone, they didn\u2019t care that I was a different race/religion. Whenever we visit his mum makes a big meal of all my favourite Egyptian foods because she knows I love her cooking. \n\nIm not saying this to brag just to show you that it\u2019s possible to date a man from a conservative culture/religion and have a good relationship with his family, it doesn\u2019t have to be like your current situation. So please don\u2019t settle for this treatment. Just know that her attitude will not go away and will probably worsen with marriage and especially children.", "NTA. But you need to understand you will be dealing with this kind of disrespect the entire relationship. \n\nPakistani parents do not believe in raising their children to be their own adults. Until they pass, they are in control. They will do everything to exclude you and make you uncomfortable because they want you to leave. \n\nYour husband needs to do more aside from bare minimum to \"keep the peace\". Theyve already made it clear they wont accept you and its up to him to demand they treat you woth respect because they will not stop.", "NTA. i just caution you against \"stooping to their level\" for lack of a better term. it is absolutely unfair for them to treat you this way but they are your partner's family and it will be easier to \"play nice\" with them.", "NTA but think VERY carefully about marrying this guy. It is VERY difficult to be in a marriage where your cultures are so extremely different. You are marrying the whole family and you are very young. I would definitely go for a very long engagement if you decide to continue with this relationship", "No, not the asshole.  But you should really think this over.  You don't marry a person, you also marry their family.  Your partner's family absolutely 100% sucks with old country values that deserve to go on the trash heap of history.  That is not ever going to change.  You're 22.  Think if you want to live another five or six decades or so with that dynamic going on.  Every family gathering, every major milestone or event is going to be drama and bullshit.", "NTA...How your partner reacts to your wishes will show how in sync you are.  You shouldn't have to tolerate people who don't have your best interests at heart.", "NTA. You aren't obligated to invite anybody you don't want there, family or not. It's your wedding, not theirs!", "NTA for feeling that way, just remember that they are always going to be his family. Ultimately its going to depend on what he wants to do, because if he chooses you and agrees it will be fine but he would not be wrong to want to include his family too. You are both marrying into each others family so must accept what comes with it.", "NTA, those events should be something you enjoy and I totally understand your feelings and they are reasonable. \nAlthough I\u2019d try to do the yellow rock method to avoid being in between your bf and his parents. Just be nice but do not engage any further (if that is something that is possible to you without too much mental acrobatics, some can do that easy and some can\u2019t) Just don\u2019t give in or care. I think this would include inviting them since it\u2019s usual to invite parents - or leave the decision to him. \nAnd maaaayyybe in a far future they might accept you, but it is not up to you to actively work for that.", "NTA, but instead of reciprocating bad blood, just don\u2019t engage with them maybe? It\u2019s your wedding and you should get to decide who is in it, but it is also your fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding too. You both will need to communicate clearly with each other and stay on the same page to come to a solution you both can live with.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say ESH.\n\nHonestly, I think the people cautioning you against this marriage are correct, and not just because \"his family are awful\". I think it's a terrible idea because you clearly FUNDAMENTALLY do not understand his culture or how interpersonal relationships work within its structure, and given this post, you don't seem to want to. This isn't about you being \"a white girl marrying a Pakistani guy\". It's that you're viewing this whole thing through your white lens and not even considering that everyone else in this situation - your fianc\u00e9 included, is experiencing all of these interactions entirely differently from you. \n\nTo be clear, I fully acknowledge that they were AHs to you. They were rude, unwelcoming, didn't try to get to know you, and were blatantly disrespectful to you in trying to arrange a marriage for him whilst knowing that he is in a happy relationship  with you. There is no culture in which behaving like that is okay. If they were struggling with your relationship, they needed to try to communicate in a way that was respectful, and at least see if they could find common ground with you. And shutting you out of family occasions as his serious partner was just disgusting. \n\nBut everything you've written, including your response to their behaviour - \"they didn't welcome me so I'm going to uninvite them\" - indicates that you REALLY don't understand what it is to come from a culture where \"individualism\" isn't a thing. Where family, reputation, tradition are everything. And you definitely don't seem to understand what the repercussions would be of trying to separate your fianc\u00e9 off from his family or encourage him to make a life where they are less involved. For him, that's probably unfathomable.\n\nESH, because his family were really rude, but if you're going to marry a man who comes from a rich, complex ethnocultural background where family ties are deeply important, maybe actually get to know and understand his culture and that it will always be a part of how he sees the world. Or else maybe don't marry him.", "NTA. \n\nbut why'd u wanna marry him after all this ?", "NTA - sauce for the goose same as sauce for the gander.  If you are banned, maybe your FMIL should be banned???", "Absolutely NTA, they treated you awfully and don't deserve to be at your wedding. However this could be a brilliant opportunity? \n\nI get it, they were super shitty and I would expect a sincere apology from them at the very least, but if you're marrying bf and intending on being in his life/ family forever, it might do you more favours in the long run to make nice. Especially seeing as you totally have the moral high ground here.", "Nope, NTA at all, even ignoring the old thing about it being the brides day you deserve to have a wedding surrounded by people you love, like and trust. If that doesn't include some family members who will most likely put in the effort to spoil the day, they can stay home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You've only been together for a year? You should wait at least another full year to get married. You need to understand what each of you want and need from his family. You need to get a grasp on what you can expect going forward: holidays, birthdays, weddings, funerals. How often does he talk to his parents?

The only exception is this: \n\n>And shutting you out of family occasions as his serious partner was just disgusting.\n\nEven if she was Pakistani, it is very likely she would not have been invited just as his girlfriend. Mainly because showing up places with your boyfriend or girlfriend are not viewed the same way as in the \"West\"- it's just not done (there are obviously exceptions to this, but from all the Pakistanis I know and grew up with, it never happened).

Because if it\u2019s the latter, you\u2019re not being \u201cblacklisted\u201d - that\u2019s just how it is in Pakistani culture, at least according to my mom.  She was born and raised over there. Only people\u2019s spouses are invited, because those are the only relationships that are seen as \u201clegitimate\u201d.\n \nOn the other hand, my mom is 73, and left Pakistan when she was 25.  It\u2019s entirely possible the culture has changed since she was there last.  She does keep in contact with people who still live there, but she\u2019s also quite religious, so maybe her experience isn\u2019t indicative of the broader culture.\n\n>Today I want to tell him that I don\u2019t want certain members of his family at our events because they blacklisted me from his sisters engagement and wedding\n\nI mean, is that how you want to start your life together?  By being vindictive?  All you\u2019d be doing is confirming their negative opinion of you.  Part of their issue with you may be that they fear you \u201ccorrupting\u201d your partner.

As in, you are about to be married to each other. As such, if you are not invited to something his is. He shouldn't go. Because what happens when you have kids?

Unintentionally. I\u2019ll tell you why. In Pakistani culture you won\u2019t attend weddings within the family until you are a wife (you are not, a fianc\u00e9 in Pakistani culture is as good as a stranger). You wouldn\u2019t be invited to any Pakistani wedding as the brides brothers \u201cgirlfriend\u201d. So, until you are his wife you\u2019ll have absolutely no place in any family events. Your partner is also an asshole for not immersing you into his culture - how can you get a long with a family you don\u2019t understand at all? Your partner may be closer in culture and thinking to how you are but I can guarantee you most of his family live on a completely different planet to you. You need to learn and understand this if you\u2019re going to happily marry this guy. Pakistani culture is very family-orientated so if you want to make a go of this with your fianc\u00e9 you need to learn how his family is so you can navigate yourself within it. Otherwise you\u2019ll find yourself pushed out as you have been. I don\u2019t mean any of that in a cynical way, but if you\u2019re not willing to do what I\u2019ve set out I can almost guarantee at some point in your life it will affect your marriage massively.", "NTA\n\nBut good luck if you actually marry into this mess. They'll either accept you by the 1st grandchild or they won't. \n\nDon't disinvite them from the wedding that's just crass and chances are they may not come anyway. \n\nSet your boundaries and let your partner deal with his family. That's his problem, not yours, and you don't want to get involved in that. \n\nIf you get involved there won't be any wedding, if you let him lead,  you'll get an elopement.", "NTA but this marriage WILL be painful to you unless your fiance has 100% cast off the toxic teachings of his home culture that STRONGLY encourages men to listen to mommy.", "It's probably more a cultural thing than anything else.  However it's highly unlikely she will ever accept you completely as a daughter in law if you two become engaged/married.  Culturally she will ALWAYS be more important to her son than you.  So either get used to being the second most important person to him or move on.  NTAH though.  You COULD find him to be an exception but it's not common in that community.", "Some (many?) cultures are toxic and not worth understanding.", "She marry into a conservative family.
