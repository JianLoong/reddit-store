I\u2019ve since banned my MIL from stepping foot in our house and blocked her on all social media. \n\nMe and my wife (both 27) have a 2 year old. My MIL is incredibly hands on. She hangouts at our place a lot and watches our child. I would call my MIL bossy. She thinks she\u2019s always right. Runs the family, nobody questions her. Her husband is a pussy who allows her to dictate everything. When we first got together she was with my wife\u2019s dad at the time and wasn\u2019t as bad. When they divorced her behavior worsened and none of her kids checked it. \n\nI\u2019m totally estranged from my mother. It\u2019s well known on both sides of the family. At 15 my mom cheated on my dad, then tried to get sole custody and make me live with her AP and his shithead kids. I cut her out at 17 and been NC since. My MIL never liked this. MIL threw a legit tantrum whenever my mom wasn\u2019t invited to our wedding. She made multiple comments to my dad about my behavior towards my mom during the wedding planning process. I told my wife I\u2019d walk if she didn\u2019t stop. She eventually did after my wife put a foot down. \n\nI have had one rule with my MIL. My mother gets no access to my kid. No public pictures and no visits. Well this weekend I found out thru a family member that my mom had been getting pics/updates from my MIL for months. Maybe even a year. Even allowed my mom to visit our son at her place. I was furious. I called my wife, she ran to the store so her mom was watching our son at our place. \n\nI immediately went home and told my MIL to get the hell out of the house. She acted confused. I told her I knew and provided evidence. She kept denying it. I asked to see her phone and she refused. I said she was now banned from our house, and banned from seeing our son. \n\nKicked her out. My wife came home yelling at me until I showed her the proof. She started apologizing. But said her mom is important to her and I can\u2019t just remove her from our sons life. I said MIL did it to herself. I can no longer trust the woman in our own house. Reminded her of the wedding and all the other shit this woman has put us through. And asked why is she still defending this toxic woman. She said she realizes her mom isn\u2019t perfect. But will try to reason with her. I said she\u2019s been attempting that for 5 years. And isn\u2019t getting through. Enough is enough. Her lack of backbone is why her mom thinks she\u2019s can keep doing this. If she doesn\u2019t wanna back me on this then we can start going to marriage counseling and work from there. Because this is the hill I\u2019m gonna die on. My wife has been on the phone with her mom all day yesterday and today. Her mom gave some half assed apology over the phone. I said she wasn\u2019t forgiven. My wife is calling me an AH. I think I\u2019m finally standing up for myself here.

Marriage counseling is a must. Maybe phrase it by saying absolutely no discussion on contact with MIL until we\u2019ve gone to therapy. She is welcome to chat with her - absolutely cannot bring son. \nHopefully a counselor will be able to get it through her skull why this is unfair to you. She is blinded right now by her affection for her mom, and this makes it impossible for her to see where you are coming from. Whereas you\u2019ve cut your mother off, she seems to be blindly affectionate for hers. It will take time. Stand your ground, be calm, make sure she knows you love her, but this is beyond a betrayal for you. Maybe one day she can get supervised visits, but for now, privileges are revoked.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife knows her mother is a spiteful piece of work and maybe,just maybe she's finally realising just how awful a person she is. \n\nAs for your MIL?\n\nShe deserves everything dished to her. She's toxic. \n\nShe should have no part in your family life because she can't be trusted. \n\nMaybe some kind of counselling is needed for you, in particular, to be able to air your views on neutral ground. \n\nKeep her blocked!!", "Nta. This is a hill I would die on.", "NTA. You set a very clear boundary that has been (repeatedly) violated for months.", "NTA \n\nWhat MIL did was a huge and unforgivable boundary violation.\n\nShe had zero right to do what she did and now she has to live with the consequences. Your wife should be fully supportive of your decision.", "NTA. MIL can't be trusted.", "NTA  You were perfectly clear, and your MIL lied to you over and over.  She is not trustworthy.  If she breaks this rule and lies about it, because she is so certain that she is unquestionably right all the damn time, what will she do next time? And the time after that?", "NTA.  MIL betrayed your trust and allowed your mother to have contact and information about your son.  I would do the same.  Your wife will have to figure it out in terms of having a relationship with her mother.  You know that your wife will take Son to see MIL, right?  So then you and Wife have to agree on basic ground rules e.g., MIL doesn't have unsupervised access to Son.  Good luck, I don't see this working out any time soon.", "NTA. Your MIL did this, not you. She knew exactly what she was doing. She did it over a period of time then blatantly lied about it. If she gets away with it now, she will take it as permission to continue.", "NTA. your wife needs to keep her mom in line, which she isn\u2019t. so MIL is now on time-out. you\u2019re right, MIL did it to herself", "NTA. Good for you for standing your ground. She intentionally ignored something that is clearly important to you. Who knows what else she'd do if left to get own devices. It's about time she learn there are consequences to her actions. I would suggest to find ways to let her slowly earn back trust with baby steps with severe consequences for failures.", "NTA MIL is the AH. It is obvious why your wife cannot stand up to her mother; she sees the mother as normal because she is used to being mistreated. But Anyone who breaks a parent's rules for their child loses the right to see that child. It's that simple. MIL is not a safe person.", "NTA. You set clear boundaries for your MIL and displayed clear trust in her by leaving her unattended with your child. Not only did she betray that trust by sending your estranged mother updates, she further betrayed it by allowing your mother to visit the child against your will, without even asking you OR your wife. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis woman is a loose cannon who clearly has no respect for boundaries. I wouldn't leave her alone with a bag of flour let alone a child.", "NTA. Omg I would lose all of my shit", "NTA. \n\nAs some one who has one shitty parent on my side and my in laws side thus would be the hill I die on too.", "NTA you stated your terms, it was disregarded. You are entitled to react. I feel sorry for your wife in terms of her probably feeling like shes stuck between a rock and a hard place, but she kinda needs to realise that she has to back you on this.", "NTA. MIL is used to overriding everyone in her life--you obviously have to take a dramatic stand to get through to her.  Hopefully losing access to her grandchild, straining her relationship with her daughter, and causing trouble in your marriage will finally make her realize her opinion is not the end all be all of everything.", "NTA - but duuude you are in one crappy situation.  I don\u2019t envy you at all.", "NTA - You don\u2019t see your mother and the reason for that doesn\u2019t matter. Whatever it is, it needs to be respected and your MIL already crossed the line so far in that at the wedding, I personally would have cut her out at this point.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t necessarily blame your wife for her mother\u2019s behaviour as people that toxic usually have worn their families down to the point that they  now believe it\u2019s them imagining that this behaviour is unreasonable. Also, some people are just awful and cannot be controlled.\n\nBut no, not the AH at all.", "NTA\nTime for therapy and marriage counselling, stat.\n\nThis was a clearly established boundary and she broke your trust.  Keep your evidence of what she did in case things go very poorly and you and your wife separate, you'll need the evidence of you want to establish limits on MIL in any future custody disputes.", "NTA.\n\nYour partner did not reign in her mother, so you were left with no choice. What your wife's mother did was a severe betrayal of trust, and your reaction to it was well within the realm of what is reasonable (and prudent). But I'm of the belief that it's firmly your partner's responsibility to define the boundaries with her mother. So the culpability here lies as much with your partner as it does her mother.", "NTA- good for you!!!!", "NTA,  what your mil did was a deliberate complete betrayal of trust", "NTA. You have a boundary and she danced across it without a care in the world and if your wife refuses to back you on this then that\u2019s a conversation you need to have with her. How would she like it if it were her boundaries", "NTA  - and I agree that your MIL lost all house and son privileges.  It is not up to her to decide to expose your son to your mother against your explicit instructions.\n\nMaybe, sometime in the future, ***if*** you and your wife get on the same page ***and*** your MIL understands that she was ***wrong***, you can work toward supervised visits, no pictures, between your MIL and son sometime in the future.  \n\nGood luck!", "NTA. She shit on the one boundary that you had. You have no reason to trust her. Your wife has to either respect this or decide her mother is more important than her husband.", "NTA of course but there's a lot of work to do here. Your wife is in a pretty terrible position now so please don't overlook that.", " Nta, dude this is a hill to die on period, because anyone with common sense would refuse to be around some who is toxic near there kids, seriously you need to make it every clear that she is choosing to teach your son that it's ok to be around and be  walked all over like a doormate by toxic people, and if she try to say otherwise tell her what example is she setting then, her mother doesn't respect her or your boundaries, her mother is letting your mom who is a cheater around your son, and if the time comes when your son is older and her mother doesn't approve of or just doesn't like something about him, is she going to act like a enabling spineless coward?, seriously she needs to get her priorities straight and got counseling and stop enabling her mom.", "NTA  \nRegarding your son you are 100% correct. She breached your and your wife's rule regarding your son. your trust and so doesn't havy any rigth to get access to your son\n\nand its Your choice to go NC with her. \n\nBut you cannot make that decision for your wife. You cannot control if your wife sees her mother, that would overstep your wiife's boundaries majorly.\n\nI'd recommend making 2 things clear to your wife.\n\nA) until you explicitly allow any access or info or pictures your MIL doesn't get any.\n\nB) your wife can choose to interact ith her mother as she pleases regarding herself, regarding your and her son **not**\n\nI personally am all for 2nd chances but I could also see why you are rn rather unwilling to budge. But I'd advise to offer your wife an option for the future. you and your son will not interact with MIL for atleast (insert time frame until you are willing to give her another chance, maybe a year or so) and then she slowly gets access again, maybe at first supervised visits where you are present non stop and so forth.  \nAlso clearly state if in that time frame she tries anything that goes remotly against your boundaries that chance is gone. idk trying to get pictures from other sources (personaly I would budge on that point as long as she does not forward them to your mother) idk trying to pick him up from kindergarden or school or whatever. Directly contacting your son, continuosly pressuring you to lift the ban", "NTA\n\nOP you are right this is the hill to die on. Your MIL is toxic, spiteful and vindictive. She has no respect for you clearly shown during your wedding planning process and this massive betrayal of trust. She did it on purpose and deserves the consequences of her actions. Are you sure your wife didn't know? Your wife is enabling her behaviour and tbh sounds incredibly weak. It was her responsibility to enforce boundaries with her mother which she clearly failed to do. The best option is to go to therapy and hopefully a professional help you navigate this.", "NTA. But your wife isn't going to change. She will always pick her mom over you.", "NTA - MIL is toxic AF. She should not be around your family. I can't imagine what other crap she would pull if she were given the opportunity. I'm sorry your wife is grieving, but she needs to understand that boundaries are boundaries. I hope she supports you because what she did was wrong.", "NTA..that is YOUR child and YOUR mother..your MIL had ZERO RIGHT to go against your wishes. Id also be furious. I'd not back down. You cut your mother out of your life for a reason..if your mil can't respect that then who is SHE to decide differently for your child. She is no one.", "NTA, but I hope you do follow up and go to marriage counseling.  This is a very difficult position for your wife.  You two will need to work through it together - and for the sake of your family a professional could be really helpful.", "NTA \n\nThis is the hill OP, you are right. Good luck and please show this to your wife; she needs to see that this is not OK and needs to support you first not her mother.", "NTA you're the father and you were right to do what you did.", "NTA", "NTA. No unsupervised contact.", "NTA- it sounds like this was your only boundary, and it was there for a reason. She repeatedly stamped on it and didn't back down. \n\nYou may need to consider that your marriage is over. It doesn't sound like your wife is going to side with you. \n\nIf you divorce, your wife and MIL will still see your child, and MIL will still be able to contact your mother with updates and maybe even let the kid meet her. \n\nI have no idea what you should do, but I don't envy your situation. \n\nAll I can say is, if someone was sending pics of my child to the one parent I don't speak to, I would be bringing up restraining orders against them.", "Just for context, look at this post where the man totally supported his fianc\u00e9 in the boundaries HIS mother crossed in regards to his fianc\u00e9\u2019s father. \nReddit AITA followers rallied behind him.  Wonder if genders were reversed for you, what would the consensus be? \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ynn0jd/aita_for_uninviting_my_mother_to_my_wedding_after/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nStand strong! Your MIL allowed a clandestine meeting with your estranged mother and YOUR child. This is just the beginning! What else do you think your MIL will decide she knows better about for YOUR child? Overnight parties? Skipping school? Drugs and alcohol use? Sleepovers? YOUR child will know that MIL will allow/encourage things that you have laid boundaries for.  Bottom line - MIL cannot be trusted to respect the boundaries you set.  That should be between you and your wife. \n\nYour wife should agree on this.   You are NTA", "NTA\n\nI've had to deal with some similar things in immediate & extended family. You can handle this - stay strong.  There are a few important things you should consider:\n\n* Try not to let this create a permanent rift with your wife to the extent you can - even though you are right, it's not worth it. Appeal to her empathy, be extra nice to her, be willing to make some compromises, etc. Whatever you can do while still being true to your principles.\n* I see your side on \"no pictures\" rule, but IMO it's pretty tough to put that rule on somebody else - if they have a picture and share it with somebody, that's not in your control. So maybe that's an area you could compromise on (your call - just throwing out ideas).\n* Allowing mom to visit baby was a MAJOR betrayal. Even if you compromise in other ways, I think you are totally in your rights to insist that baby never be left in MIL's care and no unsupervised visits.", "NTA. It's a bitter pill for your wife to swallow, but she needs to choose between her family of choice (you and your children) and her toxic mother. The current situation is untenable as MIL has zero respect for your boundaries.", "NTA and it\u2019s disappointing that your wife doesn\u2019t have your back.", "NTA", "I feel like something is missing from this story.\n\nBut NTA\n\nYour MIL is not being honest when making those apologies. She only wants to be allowed in your house again. Then she will continue doing the exact same things. \n\nSounds like she thinks she knows better than everyone and if she didn't respect your wishes before, don't expect her to do it from now on.", " NTA- you\u2019ve gone NC w your mom and have said that she is not to have access to your child and you MIL stomped all over that. Your wife being ok with that is not right or ok and shows that she doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries. This would be my hill to die on", "NTA as long as you are just stating she can not come into your home and be around the child you share with your wife. This changes to a huge Y T A if you tell your wife you get to say she does not go see her mother anymore.", "Um. I\u2019m not saying you were wrong but honestly I think there are bigger issues.  \n\nYour mom cheated and you have not gotten over it. Unless there is more to the story it might be time YOU heal. I don\u2019t think you need to forgive and forget but you need to heal. \n\n\nNTA But I wish you well and hope you can come to peace with things.", "NTA. You've always been clear about your limits and she's tested and surpassed every one of them, you're right. \n\n\nBut your wife may not see it the same way, and honestly it's her right, I would let her deal with her crazy Mom alone!!", "NTA but I think you should cool off for a few days before making any big decisions. It seems like MIL is big support for your family's life (helping with the kid,  etc. ) and that going away could be a burden for you. \n\nIf after a bit you reconsider,  your wife and you should set some very strict ground rules for MIL and your child.  You are the parents and sometimes pushy grandparents forget that fact.", "NTA.", "Nta", "NTA and you are correct when you say you are standing up for yourself. I am so sorry you are going through this and I'm almost sorry that your wife is too. You were wise enough to realize how toxic your parent is but she clearly doesn't see it yet. Stand your ground, OP, and good luck!", "NTA, and the problem isnt just with the MIL boundary stomping and outright lies; the problem is also with your wife whom is letting her continue with this behavior. MIL needs to know she can't just keep throwing her weight around and expect everyone to bend to her knee. Your wife needs to step up and back you on this because this is a hill worth dying on.", "NTA but you can\u2019t expect her to pull the bandaid off immediately. It\u2019s much more reasonable to just say MIL\u2019s not allowed to see your son *unsupervised*, rather than not at all. \n\nOn the plus side, you can now suggest that to your wife as a compromise, so she can\u2019t say you\u2019re overreacting. This will also show you if you can trust your wife to not let her mother be with your (plural) kid alone. Seriously though, you should\u2019ve seen the warning signs a long time ago.", "I had to deal with a father who cheated, replaced our family with another, and then tried to merge the families together. I understand how much it sucks and how much anger you'd have over it. I understand wanting to keep them out of your and your kid's life forever. And you're right to be furious with MIL. But your wife is just as much your child's parent as you are. You cannot control everything like this. She deserves some input. ESH.", "ESH - Except maybe your wife. Your MIL had no right to go behind your backs and involve your mother. That sucks, and it's totally fair of you to be mad about it, but your wife isn't in control of her mother and it's not fair to expect that she can somehow control her mother's behavior any more than you can control \\*your\\* mother's behavior, so it's pretty AH behavior to jump to \"I said she\u2019s been attempting that for 5 years. And isn\u2019t getting through. Enough is enough. Her lack of backbone is why her MIL thinks she\u2019s can keep doing this.\" \n\nThat's wildly disrespectful to your wife. It's fine if this is the hill you want to die on, but it kind of sounds like you're letting your relationship with your mother influence how you see your wife's relationship with hers, and you're expecting her to jump immediately to \"cut this person out of my life\" as a solution when that might not be what she wants or needs.", "ESH.  You are entitled to make rules regarding your mother and her access to your child, and your MIL was HORRIBLE in violating that.\n\nI understand having the visceral reaction you had with your MIL.  I can't say I wouldn't have done thr same thing.\n\nWhere I do fault you, though is that, having had some time, you are still holding to unilateral decisions made in the heat of the moment and you are not treating your wife as a partner with equal say in coming up with a solution that is acceptable to both of you.\n\nMy other issue is that you seem extremely glib and judgmental about your wife's relationship with her mother.  This is not easy for her, and you seem to be faulting her for not being more like you in going NC with her mom the way you did.  You are different people with different paths, and I suspect you will get farther with respect and empathy than with rigidity and judgment.\n\nYour wife needs to be more willing to compromise.\n\nI hope that yall follow through with thr counseling regardless.  It will help you work together to set appropriate boundaries surrounding your child.\n\nBest of luck to you and your family.", "I think it\u2019s concerning that your boundaries come in the form of controlling your wife. \n\nThe mother upset your boundaries and she shouldn\u2019t do that, she is wrong for it. You are wrong by controlling how your wife sees her mother. Not everyone is so willing to throw family members out of their lives and it is not your decision to make.", "ESH. I understand the mother in law breaking the trust, but it seems like you didn't even allow your wife to have any input. To me it sounds like she went from a controlling mom to a controlling husband.\n\nHer mom is also clearly a big part in her life, and those kids are not just yours. All of this is a mutual decision. Your wife is the only victim in all of this", "ESH your reaction is to extreme. \n\nYour wife is correct you can't cut her out of your life. Otherwise it means your wife cuts her out of her life as well. You have more or less made your wife choose between you or her mom by canceling your MIL.", "YTA for unilaterally making a decision that affects everyone in the family without even giving one single fuck about your wife\u2019s input.", "ESH \n\nYou're NTA for being done with the relationship but you can't decide this by yourself. You're literally threatening your spouse with divorce over trying to force her into cutting off her mom. &#10;  \nRemember that if that happens, at least half the time you'll have *no say* about your son not seeing her.  \n\nTake it down a notch. That's her son, too. Express your wishes and fight for them. But part of marriage and parenthood is making decisions together. Decide if this is a hill you're truly willing to die on and if you're going about it effectively.", "ESH good luck with the divorce and the eventual NC with the kid.", "YTA. You can't unilaterally kick your wife's mom out of the family. Your wife is obviously very close to her mother and you're going to get divorced if this is the hill you choose to die on. And given your willingness to just cut people out forever, your wife would be smart to take the same attitude preemptively.

She clearly loves them both and wants them both in her life.\n\nThe mom is the issue. She disrespected her son in law by repeatedly overlooking his boundaries, and disrespected her daughter by forcing her into such a position in doing so.", "His mom destroyed their family and then tried to make him play happy family with her new husband. Why forgive someone who cares so little about your feelings?\n\nMy dad didn\u2019t cheat but he did choose to play happy family with his new wife. That\u2019s why our relationship is cellular and has been since I was 13.", "Why is it disrespectful to his wife? She can see her mother, it just can't be at the home they share and MIL doesn't get access to the kid.\n\nQuite frankly, that breach of trust MIL did was big enough for the daughter to go NC until her mother can muster up an actual apology. OP never has to forgive his MIL for this breach.\n\nEven during the wedding planning, the wife didn't confront her mother until OP said he would walk. OP is right and his wife isn't standing up to her mother like she should.", "Exactly! Also, MIL seems to be providing free childcare for their 2 yr old. Having support as a new mother is invaluable. I don't think OP realizes what taking that away would mean or whether OP is willing to step up to provide the additional support.", "He never said his wife couldn't see her mother.  He said the mother can't come to their home or around their son.  And those absolutely ARE his decisions to make.", "She can see her mom just not in their shared house simple as that her mother was so far out of line I cant even comprehend how she would think its ok to allow her back in the house.", "How is it wrong to assume your spouse and coparent would ALSO want to keep your offspring away from people you know objectively you can't trust?", "Good. Make the choice. Rip the bandaid off. It shouldn\u2019t even be a choice between your spouse and anyone else. If she even has to question it\u2026 then I\u2019m better off.", "Why ESH?", "To be honest you need to set a timeline for your wife to change. Like what is the threshold. She hasn\u2019t changed in the last 5 years. Are you willing to spend another 5 years with a partner who doesn\u2019t support you and prioritizes her mother of you?", "Sounds like he's already up with it during the wedding and a few years of marriage. Sounds like the wife may not be willing to put her mother in her place.", "Even if she wasn\u2019t aware it was happening at the time she is now aware that it happened and is still pushing to let MIL in the child life", "I can't imagine a circumstance where saying to your partner that their \"lack of backbone\" was the reason for something could be considered anything \\*BUT\\* disrespectful. \n\nI'm not defending MIL's actions, but she's a grown ass adult, and should be treated as such. Wife is \\*NOT\\* responsible for MIL's behaviors, MIL is. OP insulting his wife because he's mad at MIL is disrespectful. OP is entitled to disown his mother for her actions, and he can and should talk to Wife about how to handle MIL's breach.", "Because you and your spouse are two different people? Just because someone's breaks your trust it doesn't necessarily mean cutting them off is the only answer. Especially if it's someone you care about, like a mom. Isolating someone from their family, to me is never the first answer. Very extreme, especially since it seems like the wife is clearly affected by it. Just comes across as if he is not even thinking about her feelings", "You are not being unreasonable. You were very clear in your boundaries.   You had good reason to set those boundaries and they should have been respected.  Your MIL was/is disrespectful and dishonest.   She thinks she gets to decide what is best for YOUR child and YOUR family.  She ignored this basic request. What else will she decides she know better about in the future?!?  \nYou need to be very clear with your wife that this is  not okay.   Counseling will be very important moving forward.   Good luck! \n\nNTA", "I understand your hurt but take a second and think this through. Your headed down a path with 2 options:\n\n1- you force your wife to choose you. And she will resent you for this. Maybe forever. And this ends with a divorce.\n\n2- you guys go straight to a divorce because this is your hill to die on.\n\nSo if you keep forcing this your life ends in divorce. Your wife hasn\u2019t done anything that would not let her have 50/50 custody. And as long as mil isn\u2019t a danger to your child no judge will make your wife keep your son away. And you will not have any say so on her seeing your son.   \n\nSo I suggest calming down. You have every right to be upset but if you keep forcing the situation you will loose your family and your mil will still see your son. So I suggest couples counseling. And try to work on boundaries you both can agree on. Your wife can leave today and take the baby and move in with mil and there is nothing you can do. As long as your mil is not a danger a judge will not force your wife not to let your mil see your son.", "Damn. YTA, just for this comment. You sound like an extremely controlling AH. You display all the characteristics you acuse your MIL of having. I hope your wife divorces you. Good luck keeping you mother from seeing her grandchild after the divorce.", "Wow seriously?? That's literally her mum. Just because it was easy for you doesn't mean it would be easy for someone else. You are not even trying to see things from her perspective...", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 Making your spouse pick between you and her family is a major red flag of domestic abuse. You are controlling af. MIL shouldn\u2019t have gone against your wishes but honestly with the way you are treating Wife, I hope she leaves you.", "Said the man who will die alone. \n\nShe's allowed to not side with you when your being unreasonable.", "You will end up alone if your solution to all of your problems is NC. I assume you made vows to wife when you married her. Compromise is part of marriage, and you are unwilling to show any grace to your wife, who hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. You can absolutely say you don\u2019t trust MIL to watch the son anymore but you can\u2019t force your wife to cut her family out of her life. That\u2019s one tactics abusers use to isolate their victims. The problem is MIL and you and wife should be a team facing the issue together. Work with your wife on this, not against her. If she needs a relationship with her mom, figure out how to set boundaries you are both comfortable with (ie potentially something like MIL can no longer be around son alone, one parent must be present). There is a way to set boundaries with MIL without forcing your wife to go NC.", "But it isn't just OP's child. Look at this from the wife's perspective - this is her mother, who she seems to consider an important part of her life. And it seems as though her mother also does a lot to help with watching their son and childcare. This will be a far more noticeable shift in the wife's life over OP.\n\nSetting boundaries is great, but making ultimatums without discussion or compromise isn't. I understand OP's POV. I don't think there are any easy solutions here. But the wife being upset is a pretty normal reaction imo.\n\nThey needed to come at this as a team, like during  the wedding. Counseling might be a good idea, since OP mentioned that. But he also needs to understand, I think, that while cutting off his mother worked for him, that doesn't mean his wife will be able or willing to do the same.", ">Isolating someone from their family, to me is never the first answer. \n\nThe wife is NOT being isolated. She can see and talk to her mother at any time or any place except for their home. \n\nThis is NOT the first answer. This is 5 years in the making. This is a final answer after years of boundary stomping and completely ruining his trust and subjecting their child to a person that she knows they feel is toxic. \n\nThis was NOT the MIL's decision to make. She had NO right to do that. Neither she or the wife should ever expect OP to forgive her. There's no \"righting\" this wrong.", "He has every right to be upset. They overstepped his boundaries. But I think he needs to calm down and think rationally. His wife is in the wrong for not backing him up.\n\nBut at the rate he is going the only person that will win in this is the mil. If the wife leaves. No judge will force the wife to keep the son away from mil. Unless she is a danger to the child. Which I assume she isn\u2019t. So he needs to calm down and try counseling with the wife to see if they can come to a resolution they both can agree too. \n\nStaying married he controls how much mil is alone with the baby. Pushing this and causing his wife to leave he won\u2019t be able to control when and if the mil is alone with the child. \n\nI agree he has 100 percent right to be pissed. But if he keeps pushing as he is this could backfire. He should push for counseling with the wife and try to come to some boundaries with mil.", "OP is 100% in the right. The wife is enabling a toxic MIl.", "The MIL allowed OPs mother who he has gone completely no contact with since he was 17 to VISIT his child . Are you seriously trying to say that she should still be involved in the kids life??  \nOP isn\u2019t telling the wife she can\u2019t see her mom anymore just not the grandchild and that is completely reasonable considering what she did", "Those are not just his children though. They are hers as well. She is their mother. She has as much of a say as he does. He shouldn't be the only controlling how things goes.\n\nAlso he wrote in another comment, how the wife should just cut off the mother in law, that's why I said that", "You support blindly supporting spouse at the expense of any other relationship? \n\nDoesn't need to be about this post specifically just as a general concept.", "In this scenario yes.", "His statement about her making the choice was a general statement. Not about this scenario..."]}
