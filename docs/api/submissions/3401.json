It's her wedding, not yours.  Sounds like she needs some therapy help more than a wedding if she keeps going back to an abusive charter.", "NTA. I was in your friend\u2019s almost exact situation before I got married to my ex-husband. It was a very bad relationship and he was clearly emotionally abusive. My friends didn\u2019t like him for valid reasons. When I said I was getting married, many of my friends politely informed me they would not be able to make it. I felt upset at the time but we went forward with a courthouse wedding and a small family dinner afterwards. \n\nHe started beating me within a month. My close friend again tried to help me by allowing me to stay with them when I left him and went back time and time again. Eventually, she told me her house wasn\u2019t a hotel. Stay or Go but no more back and forth. I felt betrayed. Long story short I finally left him for good and started a new life in a different state. He\u2019s long gone. She and I are still close friends. I realized NOW that I was acting inappropriately, because I was dealing with an abusive situation and subjecting my friends to the aftermath of my trauma. My friend treated me with respect but asserted and maintained her boundaries. \n\nYou are doing the same. You\u2019re not the asshole. Hopefully, your friend will gain clarity in time. Respect your boundaries and sincerely hope for the best for her. And, be there without an \u201cI told you so\u201d when she finally snaps out of it and comes back to you.", "NTA your trying to support her by not enabling her bad relationship decisions", "NTA You placed a reasonable boundary and then tried to enforce it. It is fine not to want to be sucked into the drama cycle of someone else\u2019s relationship, especially if (as I suspect) you aren\u2019t getting reciprocal care in return. The discount part is just a total side note that should not in any way matter. Presumably you get these discounts as part of your job. It would be unprofessional to use them for your friends and who knows if you would continue to have these perks if misused. Bottom line, your friend isn\u2019t entitled to your professional perks and the fact that she is threatening to end the friendship over this tells me she isn\u2019t a good friend to begin with.", "NTA. Watching your friend mess up their life and having to be the one to sit there helplessly is horrific. You want the best for her, but for whatever reason, she can't make that happen for herself, and it's not on you to fix that for her. You've told her how you feel and she doesn't get it, and asks for more on top of it. Yes, I feel extremely bad for her being in this situation, but you're not responsible for her. Imo, you were just setting clear boundaries.", "NTA You are not obligated to let someone use your discount. That might be shady anyway depending on the details. The circumstances make it all the less an obligation.", "NTA\n\nI ended a friendship because of similar, yet slightly different circumstances, and you\u2019re really saving yourself from lots of trouble, if you take her declaration for granted now. \nTake care that the door won\u2019t hit her on her way out, then lock it up **tight**", "NTA. When they separate, telling her \"I told you so\" won't help.", "100% NTA. Your friend is in a very toxic relationship and hopefully will see the light, dump the AH and get therapy. Bless the both of you, just stay safe/mental health.", "NTA- It's clear that you've been trying to convince her to get out of this EXTREMELY toxic relationship but she refuses to listen. You cut her out of your life and refuse to go to her wedding, yet she still wants YOU to give her a discount for that wedding? She is so delusional I can't help but laugh. You did not go too far, you did exactly what any sane person would do.", "NTA - sounds like a toxic ride. You have every right to get off the rollercoaster of their relationship and that includes not supporting the wedding by not letting her use your store discounts.", "Ug, sorry you got stuck in an awkward situation because your friend has bad judgment. She needs to understand no part = no part. NTA", "NTA. Sometimes we have to let people go for our own sake. I can imagine the hundred times you've conforted her, wiped her tears, listened to her dramas, gave her advice... only to see her making the same mistake again again. You have all the reasons to be tired of this and to not want to participate in any way. And if some discounts are more important than all the times you've comforted her... she is not a friend at all. \"Let it go, let it go!...\"", "NTA.

She ignores your feelings on the matter that this person is just not good for her, then demands you use YOUR discount on HER wedding to this crappy dude? NTA", "NTA Yeah, buying the stuff with your discount and then trying to return it when they broke up again. I guess it is actually the best when this friendships ends. She uses you as an outlet for her relationship problems that she creates herself. She gives a shit about your bounderies. Maybe she even loves this drama.
