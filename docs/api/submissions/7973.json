Yes.\n\nHowever, she was an ass. And definitely already on very thin ice when it came to her being fired over leaivng 10 minutes early. Honestly there's no way they'd fire her like that unless there was already a problem. This was just the last straw.\n\nIf I may leave some advice for your future:\n\n1. do not \"remind her\" that you're the more knowledgeable person... your manager should be doing this. Demand your manager handles her appropriately, and reminds her that she needs to play ball with you or others in the team. The manager should instruct her to seek your advice if you feel she's been ignoring you. I've been on the receiving end of that talk in the past. Always better from the manager than peer.\n\n2.  Don't do this petty shit. Either management takes care of it or not. It is a reflection of management if she does this shit.\n\n3. Consider why she reacted that way to criticism from you. Maybe you also had a hand in the problem. Always good to self-criticize a bit.", "I don't have a strong opinion either way, but you may have shot yourself in the foot, because it's highly unlikely nobody will find out who said what to who that led to the termination.

Her comment is clearly demeaning and unprofessional, and it's frustrating to work with someone who is not open to feedback. It sounds like you were in a position where it is appropriate to give it and I do agree it sounds like she was uncomfortable taking criticism from someone younger than her. But is reporting her for a minor issue you yourself have done an AH move? Honestly yeah. She should have been fired or not fired on the merits of her work. This is sorta petty shit and on the flip side of what you said, as a person in a position of power and influence, you have a responsibility imo to be fair. If there's an issue with her work ethic (which includes her ability to take feedback and accountability), that's the conversation that should been had with her. Also maybe you all have a very different work culture but leaving ten minutes early is such a small thing to fire someone over and sorta controlling on the part of the company.", "INFO: at what age did you start \"in your industry\"?", "YTA.

They might even perceive it as humiliating. You may know more about the job but in my experience, some younger supervisors I've had haven't been very mature, some have been downright childish. Others have been good. Doing your job is one thing, managing people, especially older ones, is another. You can't try to micromanage them.

Never once has anyone been \u201cintimidated\u201d by my good work or constructive criticism. I would be willing to bet your criticism was unwarranted and not very constructive.

You should duck because karma will likely be coming around any minute now.", "NTA You didn't get her fired, she did it to herself by getting into a shouting match with the head of her department.

She didn't have permission to leave early, got in a shouting match with the head of the department when confronted, and already had (likely documented) behavioral issues.

OP says this has happened twice before on the job, so maybe he should take a step back and evaluate if it's really his age that is the issue or that he doesn't know when it's not his place to insert his feedback.... \n\nOP, if you keep encountering the same issue over and over, then maybe the problem is you. Also, the next time you leave early, don't be shocked if someone \"indirectly\" reports you.", "There a many workplaces where more tenured staff are encouraged to provide guidance or coaching for new staff. As a hiring manager, I couldn\u2019t imagine being solely responsible for providing 100% of the on-the-job training or onboarding without some support from my other staff, especially since I don\u2019t do many of their tasks on a daily basis and they have more specific knowledge on best practices. Him providing her ongoing feedback on their office standards for performing the work does not necessarily justify being considered the AH in and of itself.", "Exactly you also don't say things to coworkers like, \"I don't want to upset little boys.\"  Something tells me she said this and more to other people and yelling at her supervisor was the last straw.", "The fact that she went and approached a 'senior/ higher up' with a sexist remark and extremely back handed apology is probably also what came around for her? I have no compassion for that kind of behavior, and if she wasn't fired for that, it'd be something else.\n\nIn a private company  you are allowed to fire people as you like, and if she is being difficult, that is a legitimate reason to let her go.", "Why? OP reported her because she was being an asshole. If the other colleagues are not being assholes why would he report them? She treated him like an asshole so hes free to do the same thing to her.\n\nBut this is based on that OP is telling the truth and all of the truth so it gets muddy", "A team leader is generally supposed to review the work product, ensure its content and format are correct, comment and return it to the team for revisions before submitting for senior review. He was literally doing his job. The replies on this thread from people who don\u2019t understand the ISO process is astounding. Yes - other people NOT your supervisor will review and comment on your work.", "It's not clear at all whether or not OP was patronizing or condescending in delivering the criticism.", "Mansplaining is the dumbest term ever invented by humans along with cultural appropriation but i digress", "> She called you a little boy\n\nthat's an ageist comment. it would be no different than OP calling her an old shriveled up hag.", "She treated him poorly so he can return the favour and treat her poorly too. Sure its petty but ehh thats fine.\nAlso shes the one that started shouting like a fool to her boss. If she has someone or something to take care og she shouldve thought of that before losing her temper like a child.\n\nHe didnt tattle for no reason, he tattled because lack of respect on her part. Again, its petty but understandable. \n\nBut this is all conjecture since were going just by one side of the story.", "That comment wasn\u2019t even made AT work!", "Especially if she has a way to prove that others do it without repercussions. It could open the company up to a lawsuit if they fired her over it but everyone else gets away with it.", ">I\u2019d add a 4. - that reporting her for something the OP and other colleagues do definitely has potential for management to clamp down on everyone who does what she get in trouble for. The petty response to report her could have actually put OP and the others at risk of a \u2018talking to\u2019, or of stopping those moments of leeway for everyone.\n\nAlso, the employee can claim it was not a fair dismissal if everyone else is doing it. Obviously depends on the employment laws but OP would have been far better off writing up their cases of insubordination than going after something they do themselves", "Based on how this post is written, I\u2019m going to guess OP is insanely annoying about how they provide \u201cconstructive\u201d criticism. OP is 23. Even if they started working at 16 they have 7 years of experience. Someone in their 40s has been working long than OP has even been alive.\n\nNot to mention OP isn\u2019t this person\u2019s manager, unless they\u2019re seeking feedback you don\u2019t give it. Being at a company longer doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in charge or you get to tell others how to do their job.", "My thoughts as well. Leaving 10 minutes early isn't usually a fireable offense, it's a warning at best. It was her insubordination that got her fired. The termination would have eventually occurred without OPs input.", "Well he is not her supervisor, yet gives unwanted 'advice' and 'constructive criticism'. I can see how that rubs colleagues the wrong way.", "How is it an immature cheap shot? Hypocritical, but not immature. The coworker undermined them, was condescending and outright aggressive to them. OP saw a chance to deal with a royal PITA who made their working life difficult for no reason other than their own insecurity/entitlement. They weren't fired for clocking off early, they were fired for a culmination of events that led to an outright shouting match. None of that is OPs fault.", "It could be the boss playing favorites. She might have mentioned that the OP is a condescending jerk and also leaves early. The boss probably defended the OP. Wouldn\u2019t be the first time.", "but, but, but she started it!", "Exactly", ">...when these personality clashes originally started my department head explicitly told me that I should gently remind her at times that she couldn\u2019t just treat me as an equal or someone to ignore.\n\nYour department head didn't do you any favors here. It sounds like this coworker's days were numbered either way, but definitely pretty shitty of you to rat her out for something that didn't have to do with your beef. In the future, ask your department head to be clear to new hires about the hierarchy, especially if they're older than you.", "Well you certainly act like a child", "I highly doubt that was what got her fired. Leaving 10 minutes early gets a verbal \"hey, next time let me know if you need to leave early\" most of the time. The more likely reason she was fired was due to how she reacted.", "Do you know how hard it can be to fire a terrible employee at some companies? Everything has to be documented, you have to have conversations, have to keep track of everything for months.\n\nOP's company probably thought 'Oh thank god! We can officially fire her now.\"", "That depends on how the job is structured. More than half of my job is giving coaching and constructive criticism to teams I do not supervise directly.", "A lot of senior people are expected to review, critique, and help with jr professional\u2019s work. It\u2019s literally in my job description", "I don't think that this is a correct assessment. While OP is not the official direct supervisor, it is clear that OP was given supervision and leadership roles, as well as given responsabilities regarding the results of the team (including the coworker). \n\nI also think that this is One of those workplaces in which these functions were given to OP by his supervisor, but in a somewhat unofficial capacity, and was not properly communicated nor enforced to the coworkers. Thus, OP was put in a position in which he had mandate to do things, but no real power to enforce things if coworkers did not immediatly comply.\n\nAnd to me, is another justification to why this is ESH, by including the supervisors by not clarifying to everyone what were the real functions and authority of OP.\n\nEspecially after OP identifying this as problem to the supervisor.", "OUTSIDE OF WORK\u2026which isn\u2019t that strange because I don\u2019t hang out with co workers outside of work when I don\u2019t like them", "You're being weird. It's three people, not everyone OP meets. OP is the common denominator because *he's the one these events happened to.*", "If she was being reprimanded for something everyone else does and none of them get reprimanded for it then it could easily be spun by a good lawyer that it was an unfair termination.\n\nI'm sure it was a straw that broke the camel's back situation, but it can't be something everyone else gets away with.", "Yup, I have a boss, but she doesn\u2019t supervise 95% of my work. I get feedback from the leaders outside my department that I work closely with. \n\nEssentially, I\u2019m a project manager. I report into a more senior project manager, but I \u201cwork for\u201d, receive feedback and take my orders from different businesses owners and VPs. Those folks have far more oversight over my work than my direct supervisor.", "OP... You sound like the office AH. It may be unintentional, but it sounds like your communication skills could use a lot of work. It's not just what you say, it's how you say it..... You keep focusing on this \"seniority\" thing, instead of letting your leadship skills shine. \n\nLaslty, if you aren't someone's supervisor and keep giving them unsolicited feedback, you just end up coming across as a pest. If you had concerns, why not speak to her actual supervisor so that they can guide her?", "The shouting is on her. But if she is shouting that you only reported her to be petty and everyone leaves early so why is she being singled out, she has a point - and one that could be used legally against the company in some areas.\n\nYou would have been far better off writing up her insubordination or issues with her actual work as a direct complaint to her supervisor and having her fired based on that", "The shouting match that happened BECAUSE she left early. Whichever everyone else does sometimes with no consequences. That could potentially be considered discriminatory if everyone else does it and she's the only one who got into trouble because of it.", "I had a lot of issues at work with this sort of thing early in my career because I looked like a teenager despite being in my mid-late twenties. I\u2019m in my thirties and I FINALLY look like I\u2019m in my twenties (so I still occasionally get attitude but not nearly like I used to). Plus I\u2019m a woman. There was a ton of sexist, ageist crap I had to deal with. And from the majority of colleagues, not just three people. [eta: if you think being called a \u201clittle boy\u201d once is frustrating, imagine being called \u201csweetie\u201d, \u201choney\u201d, and other variations of \u201clittle girl\u201d repeatedly for YEARS]\n\nI have to say that you sound really immature in how you\u2019re handling this. If I could deal with this more professionally for over 10 years of my career (with the added sexism) then you can learn to handle this better. You behaved incredibly childish, reinforcing your lack of maturity and experience (which, you\u2019re young and have only been doing this for five years. In the grand scheme of careers, you\u2019re not actually THAT experienced).\n\nIf your supervisors aren\u2019t addressing her inappropriate behavior and remarks then continue to press the issue with them. Tell them you will not work with her because it\u2019s become a hostile work environment. But deal with it through appropriate channels, not by tattling on her for something you yourself do. \n\nNo matter your technical experience, your interpersonal skills need an immense amount of work. I recommend seeking out training for general communication skills but also supervisory / management skills. You need it.", "OP, as a woman, I can\u2019t TELL you the number of times I\u2019ve been dismissed or criticized or ignored due to my sex or age. So I understand 100% where you\u2019re coming from! \n\nThat says: Your knowledge of the subject matter may be well advanced, but the way you handled this situation was incredibly immature. Your first step after the initial conflict should have been to have her manager speak to her, or email her, letting her know that you have the authority to fix things or guide her. You\u2019re not her manager, and unless she had explicit directions there, I bet this felt like mansplaining. Second, never, never report someone for something super petty that everyone else is doing. That\u2019s childish, immature, and only reemphasizes that there are double-standards in the workplace and could come back to bite you later.", "Look..I worked in the medical field and have always looked younger than I am\u2026I have had elderly patients think that my job was my AFTER SCHOOL job \ud83d\ude02 I never had the level of issues supervising people that were older than me the way you\u2019ve described . It\u2019s you", "For most people, \"getting away with it\" means that you get a verbal reprimand. Then you say something to the effect of \"sorry, won't happen again\" and go about your day. Her reaction was yelling at her boss, so she got fired because she's a liability.", "My department is currently shifting roles (because of economy/pandemic/etc) but a big part of my job is training and then being able to be consulted about a specialized field of knowledge. It would not be outside my role, either, to report if someone left early, even though I do not specifically monitor those teams for that.", "And there is a proper way to deal with that - you file a grievance. You don\u2019t shout at your supervisor right or wrong.", "Can\u2019t grow what hasn\u2019t apparently dropped yet", "OP - based on how you outlined things in this post, you aren't coming across as a competent leader. Being a leader has more to do with being able to guide, teach, and communicate than titles and knowing how to do a job.", "A team leader or her team leader? If you\u2019re just \u201ca\u201d team leader I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d go out of your way to keep giving her feedback, tell her team leader, not her directly. It\u2019s not your place. \n\nIt sounds like you were taking liberties and she didn\u2019t like it, then you snitched on her for something everyone does regularly because you didn\u2019t like her. If I were working with you I wouldn\u2019t trust you as far as I could throw you, you sound sneaky and mean.", "So, what you SHOULD have reported was the \u201clittle boy\u201d comment- directly to HR. As a supervisor, I would NEVER allow an employee to speak to another that way. I would have documented it and counseled her. \n\nThe correct response is not \u201cwe are not equals\u201d, the correct way to say this is \u201cwe are not peers, I am the team lead my role on this project is ensuring the product meets standards and policies are followed.  Your work needs to reflect\u2026.\u201d.  You should also document that in your daily notes. \n\nThen, if she does not change her ways, you bring that to your supervisor.", "You SOUND like a little boy", "Absolutely", "i'm gonna be honest, this response makes me question exactly what went down. if your supervisor didn't see these altercations as big enough to fire her (and i call BS on them just accepting that nobody gets through to her and moving on, because in that situation they would accept that's how she is and deem her an unfit employee), i feel like you were biased based off past people disrespecting you and assumed the same of her. if she was really being that insubordinate, leaving 10 minutes early wouldn't get her fired. and neither would yelling at her boss, because as far as they know, she has a history of insubordination and they've \"let things go\". don't treat new employees based on past employees' behavior, and if you want to be in a management position, be emotionally mature enough to handle confrontation. maybe the little boy comment was because she heard you talking a bunch of shit about her around the office while refusing to confront her, and honestly? that's acting like a little boy. you need to take criticism as well and mature."]}
