Yes.\n\nHowever, she was an ass. And definitely already on very thin ice when it came to her being fired over leaivng 10 minutes early. Honestly there's no way they'd fire her like that unless there was already a problem. This was just the last straw.\n\nIf I may leave some advice for your future:\n\n1. do not \"remind her\" that you're the more knowledgeable person... your manager should be doing this. Demand your manager handles her appropriately, and reminds her that she needs to play ball with you or others in the team. The manager should instruct her to seek your advice if you feel she's been ignoring you. I've been on the receiving end of that talk in the past. Always better from the manager than peer.\n\n2.  Don't do this petty shit. Either management takes care of it or not. It is a reflection of management if she does this shit.\n\n3. Consider why she reacted that way to criticism from you. Maybe you also had a hand in the problem. Always good to self-criticize a bit.", "I don't have a strong opinion either way, but you may have shot yourself in the foot, because it's highly unlikely nobody will find out who said what to who that led to the termination.

Her comment is clearly demeaning and unprofessional, and it's frustrating to work with someone who is not open to feedback. It sounds like you were in a position where it is appropriate to give it and I do agree it sounds like she was uncomfortable taking criticism from someone younger than her. But is reporting her for a minor issue you yourself have done an AH move? Honestly yeah. She should have been fired or not fired on the merits of her work. This is sorta petty shit and on the flip side of what you said, as a person in a position of power and influence, you have a responsibility imo to be fair. If there's an issue with her work ethic (which includes her ability to take feedback and accountability), that's the conversation that should been had with her. Also maybe you all have a very different work culture but leaving ten minutes early is such a small thing to fire someone over and sorta controlling on the part of the company.", "INFO: at what age did you start \"in your industry\"?", "YTA.

You should duck because karma will likely be coming around any minute now.", "NTA You didn't get her fired, she did it to herself by getting into a shouting match with the head of her department.

She didn't have permission to leave early, got in a shouting match with the head of the department when confronted, and already had (likely documented) behavioral issues.

However if this is a pattern of behavior of not taking feedback well, the way I'm used to seeing it done at a company is her direct manager having a clear conversation with her that this is an issue as well as what the process forward is (a PIP, warning system, etc) and acting accordingly. That's the conversation that needed to be had and there are reasons these HR processes are put in place, to avoid people being fired based on who likes them interpersonally. You are in a position of influence and she is not, and that to me means you have more responsibility to act fair as a team leader. She may genuinely not be a good fit or a productive member of the team, and she def is an AH in this situation - but I'd argue you just have more responsibility to be a bigger person because of your role and could have gone about this in a more direct way about the actual issue.", "Ok, so I had to work as a barista for a bit because of the recent shut down.  One of the shift supervisors showed clear ageism towards me. Imo it was due to their own insecurity and their being so worried that I wouldn't respect them b/c they are younger than me.  Several of the supervisors were younger - I respected them, but the insecure ageist one, not so much.  Obviously I don't know if that is the type of thing happening with you but it is something to think about.  No judgement as workplaces can have nuances not evident in one reddit post.", "Please tell me you did not explicitly say \"you are not my equal.\"", "I agree, and though the former coworker also sounds unpleasant, it\u2019s not cool to narc on your coworkers to get back at them.", "This. No way she gets fired for leaving 10 minutes early ONCE. She yelled and screamed and they realized that she in not a fit.\n\nNTA", "Nah, i don't buy that. Nobody forced your hand to be that petty and immature. I don't believe for a second your supervisors were fine with insubordination but fire someone over 10 mins, that doesn't even make sense.", "If she did so many things wrong then you could have taken it to her supervisor and raised the issue of her getting fired on a legit basis.  \n\nInstead you took a petty opportunity because you \"let emotion cloud \\[your\\] judgement and got an employee fired for something \\[you\\] have done\" (your words) is an AH thing to do.

If they say no, but then I would I have noticed you do the task different to how we have trained can you show how you come to do it this way. 9/10 its a miscommunication issue and we go from there.\n\nIt\u2019s all about how your present yourself.\n\nI think you have gone in with the tone I\u2019m right and your wrong.\nIt\u2019s all about how your present yourself.\nSeems a massive misunderstanding was under way you didn\u2019t like her so got petty", "Can you tell me more about her being drunk? Where did this interaction take place?", "I think if you keep getting this response from people that you should consider the common denominator here... You. In this post you complain you aren't taken seriously because of your age and then go on to say how you acted childish af. I think it's time you consider it's not necessarily your age that's making older people refer to you in a derogatory way.", "My guess is because you are rude to them. You may have more seniority at this job, but they are competent, adult professionals old enough to be your parent, and likely do not enjoy being condescending to any more than you do.

You're right that she is probably very insecure, and unfortunately I have seen people my age get annoyed with being supervised by a younger person. This never really bothered me. Anyway, it sounds like she was eventually going to get canned all on her own. Especially since she was already drawing negative attention from above.", "But you just said 3 other jobs have had this problem? \n\nIf it\u2019s a new company how much seniority can you REALLY have? \n\nIf you rarely have to do it anyway, are you really doing that much work? \n\nThe way you phrase it makes it sound like you sit around and do nothing, and one day started criticizing the new hire.", "Then reporting her for leaving was probably just the item that got her called into her bosses office. My guess is they were probably looking to be rid of her, but needed enough of a paper trail to do it. Engaging in a shouting match with her boss is probably what ultimately got her fired. \n\nWhat you did is still kind of petty, but honestly I would never fire an otherwise solid employee for leaving a few minutes early (unless as you said it happened frequently). So there's more in her personnel file than your report.", "Because, it\u2019sHarassment. One person is being singled out for something that is acceptable to everyone else!

I\u2019m prepared to admit it\u2019s an AH move which is why I came here, I have total support in the office but that\u2019s probably just because she had made herself into a pariah by the end.", "This is exactly what I thought. It reminded me of that saying that goes something like: If you meet one AH  today then they are the AH but if you met AH all day then you're the AH. \n\nOP is the common denominator and OP ought to know that just because you're good at the work doesn't make you good at leading people in the work. If you want to be an effective leader OP it's YOUR job to make your subordinate comfortable with you because you're in the position of power. You work with their style of learning and figure out the what/how/why they are motivated and use that to guide them. You failed her. YTA", "I was thinking the same. OP, if you continuously have problems with people due to the perceived mismatch between your age/experience, you might be giving off certain vibes to people.\n\nOne guy on my team, while really smart and capable, pretty much can\u2019t talk to anyone anymore because he comes across as an arrogant know-it-all. He rubs everyone the wrong way so they\u2019ve just tuned him out. \n\nYou might study up on effective communication techniques, giving feedback, conflict resolution, etc. This stuff doesn\u2019t come naturally to most people, but it\u2019s really important to have the skill, especially as a more experienced young person in the company. As you said, some people can be averse to having someone as young as you know more than them, but understand that a true leader will take it upon themselves to figure out how to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. \n\nIf you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to make that effort, no problem, but that would mean that you\u2019re probably not cut out for a leadership position.", "I acted childish by the end of it, I didn\u2019t give her any reason to refer to me as a little boy in the 5 months previous.

It\u2019s only been 3 people out of hundreds of coworkers but it has no doubt left a chip on my shoulder.", "She wouldn\u2019t have been fired for leaving 10 minutes early, like I said. She got fired for shouting at the supervisor when asked about it. Not for the first time either.", "What did you actually say to her? Not generally, not paraphrased, but the specific words. \nOkay, I see you edited in that you did not say those specific words. I still stand by my judgment that you are an a****** for getting her fired just because you didn't like her. If someone you got along well with had also left early, you wouldn't have said anything.", "Lmao of course you did", "You suck", "So why didn't you go to your supervisor and tell them she was disrespectful to you? THAT would have been valid and a proper way to deal with this. But to not say anything about that, stew on it for months and then use some petty infraction you all do to get her fired is immature af.", "In a previous comment, you said that she said that when she was drunk. I\u2019m assuming, she did not say that at work, but in an interaction not at work. (correct me if I\u2019m wrong). Therefore, you holding it over her head for something done off hours is not professional and rather vindictive.", "Grow a set!!", "Bro you are not only violently biased, you are also so insecure that 3 bad interactions have turned you into a complete asshole in the workplace. \n\nI\u2019ll say it again. YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE.", "The one time I put my foot down was mid-argument when I said \u201cyou know I\u2019m a team leader right?\u201d when she got something wrong and refused to acknowledge it. Normally I would just let my manager deal with it but I was the only person available. I probably could\u2019ve let it slide and maybe would\u2019ve in the past but this was after she called me a little boy.", "Oh I tried, I think the attitude towards the end though so to just let things go because any discussion with her would just go south immediately. At times I was a bit angry with my supervisor for not putting his foot down more, he left it to me to remind her that she\u2019s technically my subordinate and I did that once with predictably poor results.", "Dude, it sounds like you are acting way too big for your boots. Your criticism probably isn\u2019t anywhere near as constructive as you think it is.", "You need to grow up.", "You are behaving like a little boy. You might have professional experience but you are far too immature to manage people.", "The real problem here seems to be that you\u2019re full of yourself and overly sensitive with a vindictive streak. Your revenge is that of a little, immature boy, not a mature man.
