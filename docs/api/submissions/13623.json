Micah's daughter Gemma is 9 and my daughter Serena is 8.\n\nGemma has had behaviour issues since I can remember. When she was younger she had constant tantrums, couldn't sit still, and would vandalise anything she could get hold of. As she got older, her lack of manners and destructive behaviour made her nearly impossible to be around, and besides that, she was really mean. She told my daughter that her modelling campaign photos were ugly, she calls people stupid constantly, teased my mother's dogs to the point she isn't allowed near them anymore, she's just not nice. \n\nThe other day, me and Micah were at our parents' house, and my stepdad mentioned Serena's birthday, and that she was having a small party (4 girls from her class for a shopping/spa experience and sleepover). Micah asked me if I was planning to invite Gemma (previous years Serena had large, so we invited Gemma as a courtesy). I said no, because Serena is having a small part for her friends this year and since the girls are not close I was not going to force her to invite Gemma. Micah said I was teaching Serena to exclude people, to which I said that not being friends with someone isn't excluding them. This conversation went back and forth for nearly ten minutes, and I was getting fed up of trying to be diplomatic, because I know for a fact that Micah is aware of what Gemma is like (she complains often) so I didn't see why we were skirting around the obvious. Then Micah said that I should show some compassion since Serena's party might be the only party/play date Gemma is invited to this year. I just said I wasn't surprised. Micah asked what I meant by that, and I said that Gemma is not kind to the people around her and lacks social skills and she's at an age where kids will notice that and not be forgiving. Micah seemed taken aback and said that she can't believe I would be so cruel about a child. She got her things and left and is apparently not speaking to her dad because he didn't stand up for her over what I said. She has also said she won't be coming to any upcoming family events.\n\nMy stepdad said I was right and that while he finds it hard to be honest about Gemma, it's good that I was. My mother said while I was right, as a mother it's not an easy thing to hear about your child. My husband says that I should have stuck to saying no to Gemma coming to the party and left it there because she isn't our concern beyond that and I should stay in my lane. I'm kind of questioning it now because I am someone who generally does try to stay in my lane and not get involved in other people's parenting or family business, but the comment was topical to what Micah was trying to force me to do, so I'm not sure if I was out of bounds to say it. AITA?\n\nETA: Gemma has been seen by several child psychologists and paediatricians for an ADHD/autism/other diagnosis. She was found not meet any of the diagnostic criteria.

Could this be a catalyst for Micah to step up her parenting game? I hope so - for the child\u2019s sake. Empathy is hard to teach but behavioral consequences should definitely be present.", "I\u2019m going with NTA\n\nI\u2019m sure she knows that Gemma is a difficult child and has social skill issues. But there seems to come a point in which parents will start ignoring it and treating their kid like they\u2019re exactly like everyone else, purely for their own convenience. \n\nIt\u2019s not cruel at all to point out that a child struggles socially to their parents. It would be cruel if you crouched down to Gemma and told her she was a horrible nasty child that is going to get bullied for being so rude. \n\nEven then, not inviting someone to a birthday party is not exclusion. If Gemma truly will ruin the experience at the party for your daughter and the other girls, it makes perfect sense not to invite her", "NTA. She pushed you for several minutes to say it. So you did.

By ignoring her daughter\u2019s behavior instead of getting her the help she clearly needs, she\u2019s set her up for a long lonely childhood and adolescence.

If Micah wants her to have play dates (breaks for her from Gemma?) then she needs to address her daughter\u2019s behavior. \n\nIt does sound like the kid has some undiagnosed issues, but that isn\u2019t your daughter\u2019s problem and it shouldn\u2019t be foisted on her because it\u2019s convenient.", "NTA\n\n>I know for a fact that Micah is aware of what Gemma is like (she complains often) so I didn't see why we were skirting around the obvious.\n\nMicah was skirting around the obvious and making it a whole thing for 10 minutes because she wanted *you* to be the one to bring up Gemma's behaviour as a reason for not inviting her, and then weaponise it against you - which is exactly what she did. She knew what she was doing.\n\n>she can't believe I would be so cruel about a child\n\nYou weren't being cruel. The fact is, Gemma **is** mean to other children and you're doing your duty as Serena's mother by not exposing her to that at her birthday party. The poor kid has to put up with it at family gatherings, but her birthday is an occasion when she should be able to choose who is in her sphere, where she is safe from being bullied and can have a nice time without worrying about Gemma kicking off.\n\nYou are also respecting Serena's right to say 'no' and that teaches her to draw healthy boundaries with people who make her uncomfortable. So many kids (girls especially) grow up with the expectation that they should sacrifice their happiness for people who treat them badly in the name of 'compassion' and 'being a good person'. It can result in kids becoming doormats in adulthood, which those who can sense poor boundary-setting a mile off will exploit.\n\nFinally, not inviting Gemma protects her from being the 'pity invite kid', where she will be treated like the unwelcome guest and will only serve to make her feel terrible. There's not much worse than the feeling of being invited somewhere out of obligation.\n\n>She has also said she won't be coming to any upcoming family events.\n\nGood.

Micah brought up the topic and kept at you even after you were polite. It's fine that you made sure she understood.

I hate to think that this kid is running around and everyone is just trying to stay out of the way, because that isn't helping anyone, the kid herself included.\n\nIt is also entirely possible that more is going on than simply enabling behavior (though with how Micah tried to low-key bully her daughter's way into getting invited, I think it *might* be as simple as that), something where actual treatment might be appropriate.

It's not easy to hear that about your own child, especially if it's the truth.\n\nYou've done nothing wrong.

But if you;ve had a kid and just let it do whatever...not only are you annoying everyone else you are NEGLECTING raising your kid to be successful and productive in society.", "Many kids with ASD are withdrawn, introverted, often non verbal or very quietly spoken and compliant, enjoy escaping from reality into books, gaming etc.  \n\nMeltdowns can be self isolation and mutism, not necessarily acting out and throwing tantrums. \n\nThe naughty acting out ASD is a stereotype that is plain wrong.  Some kids and adults just can\u2019t deal with being told \u201cno\u201d", "if people listen to reddit advice, it's going to be a world of people living alone in studio cubicle apartments in 10 years or less.", "I have to admit after our first encounter I was exhausted. I was actually shocked when the mom called the office requesting me\u2026and I think everyone else was as well. It\u2019s amazing how much a situation changes when you know what to expect and know that your efforts (even if they don\u2019t help) are appreciated.", "That's a little too generous. Even to live in a studio you have to be able to hold down a job and get along with your landlords and neighbors. You listen to Reddit advice you're going to wind up living in your childhood bedroom for the rest of your life.", "Thank you. It is what it is and we\u2019re getting him through it one day at a time; not letting his past define him or us! He\u2019s still a great kid. Just has his issues. Don\u2019t we all lol."]}
