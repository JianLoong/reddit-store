There was immense pressure put on me to earn top grades and get into a top-ranked college. Like many other Asian kids, I took violin lessons and started prepping for the SAT in middle school. To make everything worse, David was always slightly better than me at academics and violin. \"Why can't you be more like David?\" was a phrase I heard hundreds of times while growing up.\n\nAs college decisions were coming in during my senior year of high school, David was accepted at Harvard, MIT, and many other top schools. I was rejected everywhere but my safety. As a result, mom broke down crying everyday because I was a failure in her eyes, and dad called me a disgrace because he spent so much of his hard-earned money on my violin lessons, SAT prep, and college counseling and I only had an XYZ State University acceptance to show for it. My parents then decided that I was unworthy of my college fund and used it to go on a cruise because they \"deserved something nice after wasting 18 years of effort on a disappointment.\"\n\nI went NC with my parents when I started college. College was hard. I worked nearly full-time in order to afford rent, and even then I had to take out loans for tuition.

Reconciliation is complex; their offer to pay off loans is a step, but obviously the emotional wounds remain.\n\nI am South Asian by origin and also lived in China for a while so I understand to a certain degree what you are talking about. The thing is that our parents are just what they are. They are giving what they have received and that is all they are capable of. They are from a society which has the concept of 'left over women' (I LOLed when I heard about it the first time.) You can keep asking for understanding or for them to change but it is just not gonna happen - it is too late for them. You have to make your peace with the cards you have been dealt with and find a way to move on.\n\nMy mom still doesn't understand why I can't be like the rest of her circle's kids, but I simply just ignore it or think that it is her very strange way of loving me.

I never understand parents who choose to put down their children. Especially in front of them and other people. Don't \"deserve\" a college fund because they didn't get into Ivy league school? That's cruel.\n\nAnd with the assumption about David and him being able to buy his parents luxury things mean they think of kids as investments.

Now to hurt you, so that you feel bad. \n\nI think given your age, and that you've recently graduated and capable of paying your own rent, you need to draw the boundaries. \n\nFirst - from your text I see, that it is working. You do have regrets, and compare yourself to David, and you defend yourself in their narrative, like why aren't you David. You shouldn't.   You are not comparing your father to Jack Ma or simmilar Chinese billionairs :)\n\nEach life is different, different upbringings, different environments. Even different mental comprehension.  Some people learn faster, some not. Your parents did not invest in you, they've invested in their own ego.  \n\nYou are their child, not David. If you had been better than David, they will still compare you to Steven, Jack, Xing, Xu, or whoever who for some reason is more successful than you. \n\nSo let them know, that if they value you and relationship with you, such toxic behavior should stop.  They will probably call you ungrateful, etc. Just be calm and firm - You are of course grateful, but that doesn't allow mental torture.

Im sorry you went through all this. You gave your best, and even without reaching the \"top\" you surely still had better results than many others.

Applicants who have life experience outside the typical college student applicant, and who have figured out real life problems generally make great doctors, so your age and lack of pre-med degree isn't a barrier; it's a plus when you apply. Several of my classmates were in their mid-30s when we started medical school (a long time ago). One of the classes after mine had a student who was 50! (Would not have been my choice at that age, but she got in after she decided to retire from being a full professor in a humanities field. I hope her health was good and there's longevity in her family.) \n\nHowever, you have to want it badly enough to figure out the financing, because medical school is wicked expensive and you won't make any money for a long time. No hope of working during school either, there's just no room for a job when your schedule is like taking a full semester of college over just 3-5 weeks, over and over. (Edit: My first year course load was equivalent to doing 3 years of college in the first 9 months.) Planning for a public health service position that gives student loan forgiveness or a military scholarship or something like that can help with avoiding the burden of debt. My surgery friend was in the Air Force. He said that being the only surgeon in his specialty for the USAF for nearly half the country meant an enormous number of cases that he would never have seen without being in the military, so he's one of the best at what he does. He happens to be a really nice guy who absolutely loves his job. One of my classmates worked on a reservation and stayed after loan forgiveness was done, because she loved the work.\n\nIf you want to be a doctor, start by talking to people who are residents or new doctors before you apply. Old people like myself can give you their perspective, too, but the newbies know what's happening now wrt paying for the degree and how the match works (or doesn't, depending on the specialty). This job has lots of (non-financial) rewards and satisfaction, but counting on getting rich isn't a realistic goal for most people who go to medical school \u2013 so your parents were wrong about that, again. Burnout is a huge problem, especially with the pandemic stress and 5X higher exodus in the last few years. You are guaranteed a job as a doctor if you are a warm body who has passed the hoops for licensure and credentialing. Industry jobs, research jobs, and other uses of a medical degree aren't discussed much, but there are lots of options out there. Your comparator David has an eternity of a residency ahead of him, so I really hope he loves his job rather than going into it for his parents' prestige. \n\nAllied health jobs exist, too, if you want to work in health care without going through a minimum of 7 more years of school + training. You are never \"a failure\" if you do what you like and love what you do! I would be a lot better off financially if I'd gone into another field, tbh, but I like learning and I like patient care. I'd like this job a lot better if bureaucracy and prior authorizations and games played by the insurance industry were replaced by a uniform national healthcare for all with consistent rules \u2013 obviously, I am in the USA where we bankrupt people for medical expenses instead of taxing a few billionaires. \n\nHTH\n\nEdited to add: Obviously NTA. TBH, in your field, you are probably already be better off financially than most young doctors.", "I wish they'd kick that cultural norm to the curb!", "Seeing the age of OP that wasn\u2019t possible because China had a 1 child policy.

I\u2019ve spoken to some Chinese, Indonesian, and other people from that section of the work online who think *we\u2019re* selfish degenerates who hate family because we encourage our children to live their own lives and not be bound to what their parents want.\n\nDifferent but similar, conversations on arranged marriage, divorce rates, and the role of women I a family. Since I guess encouraging women to marry people they actually like, being free to leave abusive or toxic relationships, and being able to have a life outside of homemaking and child-rearing if they want is a bad thing that leads to the erosion of society.\n\nI just don\u2019t understand the \u201ccommunal\u201d cultures who believe in sacrificing their own happiness or the happiness of their children to maintain abusive and toxic family situations."]}
