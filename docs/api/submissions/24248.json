They quickly befriended another Chinese couple once they arrived. The other couple had a son (David) who was my age, and we became friends as well.\n\nI had a typical Asian childhood. There was immense pressure put on me to earn top grades and get into a top-ranked college. Like many other Asian kids, I took violin lessons and started prepping for the SAT in middle school. To make everything worse, David was always slightly better than me at academics and violin. \"Why can't you be more like David?\" was a phrase I heard hundreds of times while growing up.\n\nAs college decisions were coming in during my senior year of high school, David was accepted at Harvard, MIT, and many other top schools. I was rejected everywhere but my safety. As a result, mom broke down crying everyday because I was a failure in her eyes, and dad called me a disgrace because he spent so much of his hard-earned money on my violin lessons, SAT prep, and college counseling and I only had an XYZ State University acceptance to show for it. My parents then decided that I was unworthy of my college fund and used it to go on a cruise because they \"deserved something nice after wasting 18 years of effort on a disappointment.\"\n\nI went NC with my parents when I started college. College was hard. I worked nearly full-time in order to afford rent, and even then I had to take out loans for tuition. It took me longer than usual to graduate, but I did it and I'm currently working as a SWE at an insurance company. I don't make as much as someone who works in big tech, but I'm doing OK for myself. Meanwhile, David graduated from MIT and Harvard Medical school, and he's currently in a neurosurgery residency.\n\nAbout a year ago, my parents told me that they wanted to reconcile. They apologized for what they put me through in high school and offered to pay off my student loans (\\~$30k). I accepted their offer and for the past year I truly believed that our relationship was improving.\n\nDavid recently got engaged. Both my parents and I were invited to the engagement party. There, my dad told David's parents that they were lucky because they raised a son who could soon buy them luxury cars and first class plane tickets to China. My mom then said \"we weren't as lucky, unfortunately.\"\n\nI almost lost it then and there, but I held it in. When we got back to my parents' house I completely lost it, saying that they had no right to compare me to David when they hung me out to dry in college while David could focus solely on school since his parents paid for everything (tuition, rent, and food), I could've gone to medical school if I received the same support that David did (I soon realized that I was not a superhuman who could juggle working nearly full-time, getting enough sleep, and earning A's in pre-med classes), and the only disappointments and disgraces in the family were them because they only cared about material things and prestige.", "created_utc": 1691585402, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15meeu8/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_they_have_no/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Reconciliation is complex; their offer to pay off loans is a step, but obviously the emotional wounds remain.\n\nI am South Asian by origin and also lived in China for a while so I understand to a certain degree what you are talking about. The thing is that our parents are just what they are. They are giving what they have received and that is all they are capable of. They are from a society which has the concept of 'left over women' (I LOLed when I heard about it the first time.) You can keep asking for understanding or for them to change but it is just not gonna happen - it is too late for them. You have to make your peace with the cards you have been dealt with and find a way to move on.\n\nMy mom still doesn't understand why I can't be like the rest of her circle's kids, but I simply just ignore it or think that it is her very strange way of loving me. But I have tried over the last 4-5 years to show her what happiness looks like outside the 'template' that she knows and we have made some progress. Just sharing it that there can be some hope but obviously it might not work in your case.\n\n\\- Communicate calmly, express how their actions affected you, and address recent hurtful comments.\n\n\\- Try to understand their cultural perspective while asserting your own needs.\n\n\\- Consider therapy individually and as a family to heal and move forward.\n\n\\- Prioritize your well-being and set boundaries as necessary.", "NTA - your parents sound exhausting. You deserve people in your life who love and support you unconditionally. I hope you can attract people like that to you.", "NTA. Wow, so many things in this post made me so sad. I never understand parents who choose to put down their children. Especially in front of them and other people. Don't \"deserve\" a college fund because they didn't get into Ivy league school? That's cruel.\n\nAnd with the assumption about David and him being able to buy his parents luxury things mean they think of kids as investments. Like, If I pay for them to have these lessons and make sure they are smart and successful, they will be able to buy me these kinds of things and give me bragging rights. That's not love. I'd go NC again.", "NTA - sounds like your parents really haven\u2019t changed", "NTA. \n\nSuch a typical behaviors of Chinese parents is even immortalized in numerous sketches (F.e. Steven He). \n\nWhat they are doing is typical passive-aggressive behavior.  Initially it was done to manipulate you. Now to hurt you, so that you feel bad. \n\nI think given your age, and that you've recently graduated and capable of paying your own rent, you need to draw the boundaries. \n\nFirst - from your text I see, that it is working. You do have regrets, and compare yourself to David, and you defend yourself in their narrative, like why aren't you David. You shouldn't.   You are not comparing your father to Jack Ma or simmilar Chinese billionairs :)\n\nEach life is different, different upbringings, different environments. Even different mental comprehension.  Some people learn faster, some not. Your parents did not invest in you, they've invested in their own ego.  \n\nYou are their child, not David. If you had been better than David, they will still compare you to Steven, Jack, Xing, Xu, or whoever who for some reason is more successful than you. \n\nSo let them know, that if they value you and relationship with you, such toxic behavior should stop.  They will probably call you ungrateful, etc. Just be calm and firm - You are of course grateful, but that doesn't allow mental torture.  If they continue, just limit communication for a while, so that they understand, that you are serious about standing your ground.", "NTA. I'm glad you got the money because now you can cut them off for good.", "NTA I\u2019d honestly just go NC again, it\u2019s not worth the bullshit all again", "NTA - what you said was justified, IMO.  Financial support is important, but it's nowhere near the support that an occasional, \"I'm proud of you, sweetheart\" and accompanying acts that has on a kid.  Years of being compared as lesser  than a friend has far more psychological damage than your parents ever realized and they deserved to hear your side of the story.", "Nta. Im sorry you went through all this. You gave your best, and even without reaching the \"top\" you surely still had better results than many others. There are parents whos kids never study anything, and becoming criminal, so your parents opinion they rased a failure is ridiculous. Parents should be proud of what their childs reach. I am in your age, have a hard time with life, and im not yet where you are right now, and still my mum never miss a Chance telling me how proud she is with everything i master. I hope, at least you can be proud of yourself, you deserve it.", "NTA.  Your parents regularly dumped on you.  Then, when they recognized their future meal ticket had gone his own way, paid to buy their future care.  Now, as they recognize the gravy train ain\u2019t coming to tiger parent land, are again dumping in you.  It would have been one thing if you took the money and ran.

But when the wife told me of his fears about not playing football, I went and told him I want him to be active but he gets to choose how, and getting hurt is not fun.
