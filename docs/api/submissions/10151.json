One of my friends had to sit me down and tell me it wasn't normal that this guy would say these things to me and then when confronted, turn it all around to where I was the one hurting him. \nI FINALLY found the courage to leave him and not care about all the crap he would say about me since his hypocrisy was so easy to spot through all of his posts. I took screenshots of every shit talking post he made about me and screenshots of every post of mine that I made about him, then I sent it all to him. Not one negative thing about him. I had 7 posts talking about how I was so lucky to have him. 14 shit talking posts about me and that was just the last 4 months of our year relationship. \n\nTdlr- I hope your gf finds the courage to leave you like I did with my exhausting shit talking ex. It is oh so clear you are the reason she's not herself. It's not a coincidence that this started when you guys started living together. You are literally verbally and emotionally abusing this woman and she deserves so much more! I hope and pray she realizes this before her self confidence is broken anymore.", "But you said dumb in that moment so answer my questions:\n\nwhy do you think you are not dumb? Why do you thought in that moment you are not dumb and smarter than her? \n\nSince when are people dumb just because they are clumsy or absent-minded? Do you want to tell me every person who is clumsy and absent-minded is a dumb person?", "Then check up on her? If you're trying to say you've seen a cognitive decline in your partner maybe make sure theyre ok health wise before idk... Just calling them dumb? Idk that'd be a start", "I feel like that\u2019s worse like tryna soften the blow of being called dumb", "She\u2019s on fire from all the gas he throws on her", "I guess I was a little angry for her being careless and lot learning her lesson last time. The previous times did little damage and I felt she didn't take them seriously enough.\n\nI am dumber than her in many ways, she can park in tight spots more easily than I can, she knows a lot of about science topics than I do. I can admit that. \n\nI wrote dumb in the title thinking I was writing a clever post where you think YTA then NTA when you read it but I was wrong. I did not call her dumb but implied it.\n\nIf you really need an answer, I thought I was smarter since I would have learned from the first accidents and been more careful and not waited for a more serious accident to think about it.", "She did an ADHD test recently and she did not have ADHD and they thought she was fine.", "I see you standing at her funeral explaining how her death is her own dumb fault.................gotta get that last dig in before you bury her", "\"\u2018accept that she\u2019s not very bright.\" i don\u2019t care how you word it or justify, you massively insulted your partner. the more i think about it-the more mad i get for her! you were rude and condescending. see it doesn\u2018t matter if we think yta (but yes you are), it matters if your partner does. the longer she thinks about this kind of negging from the person who is supposed to love and respect her, the more of an ah she will see you as. this is the kind of bs  resentment comes from. \n\nthe whole lame excuse  about maybe you\u2019re snoring too much? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f god. maybe you are, ok fix it because if nothing else it\u2019s annoying af. but unless she has something going on that needs to be medically treated or she is damaging you/your relationship in some way, find a way to freaking love her for who she is as she is. \n\ni do stupid shit all the time. i am as extra as a person could possibly be. i criticize myself all the time. i hate my current debilitating health issues and annoyingly whine/cry about them more than i should. my husband of 32 years has never done anything but build me up, reassure me when im frustrated with myself, and he makes it clear he loves me because of all of who i am\u2014not i\u2019m spite of it. and all of that? it has nothing to do with my phd. the successful respected career as an academic i had. or any other tangibles you, op, might judge as demonstrable intelligence. if you don\u2019t respect her? just move on and let her find someone who will. if you aren\u2019t building her up then you are tearing her down.  \n\noh! and do you not know the rule about it\u2019s ok for someone to criticize themself but never for you to repeat it or pile on? that\u2019s just common courtesy.", "Dude she's probably perfectly fine you're just being an ass lol you know I've had people in my life before where I wanted to say the exact same thing you did in your post...but guess what? You don't say that shit haha. Keep those ones to yourself in the future..or not...it's your headaches.", "You literally insulted your gf into thinking she had a neuro disorder, until testing came back negative?  \nYTA.  \nHow about you get testing done too and compare results on a WISC, then you can determine who the dumb one really is.", "That\u2019s not necessarily true. There are plenty of medical conditions that could cause this. Sounds like there\u2019s issues with fine motor skills and/or some cognitive issues. Either way it\u2019s better to get it checked out now and save themselves\u2026idk possibly another car accident in the future?", "I'm in agreement \ud83e\udd1d"]}
