Why won't they call you by your REAL name? I have an unusual name (not made-up just uncommon) and have had people try to convince me it is a nickname. I get called the wrong name at least twice a week, if not more. Like Rosie, my name is pronounced exactly how it is spelled. I feel your pain. At least your husband doesn't defend his parents. Make sure that if they ever introduce you by the wrong name again that you make a BIG DEAL over correcting them in front of others. Even get out your ID and show it to them. Make sure they call your baby by the correct name. Oh my, they sound just awful. Good luck.", "Omg, it\u2019s your NAME! NTA, these people are very disrespectful and they are fully assholes.", "The next time they call you Rose, stop what you\u2019re doing and look them in the eye for about 5 seconds. Then tell them, \u201cYou are fully aware that my name is Rosie. If this is not the name you use to address me I have to think you\u2019re speaking to someone else and will not answer. To continue to call me by a name you know is wrong is disrespectful and I want it to stop. \n*Do you understand?*\u201d\n  Continue holding direct eye contact until you get an answer. Or leave the room. Either way, playtime is over. The time to be polite is over. If they call you the wrong name in front of people, that\u2019s disrespectful and embarrassing for you. Your husband needs to support you on this", "Yes a bit.  It\u2019s probably kind of an honest mistake and now it\u2019s stuck.  It\u2019s not like they are calling you an entirely different name.  My secretary and I accidentally thought a coworkers name was Steve when it was really Joe.  One of three Joe\u2019s.  We finally figured it out and had a good laugh and know we affectionately call him Steve.  To ignore them is a bit OTT.", "It\u2019s not even like Rosie (or Jenny, or Billy) is an uncommon name? What is wrong with them. NTA", "My childhood best friend\u2019s name is Jenny, and my grandfather\u2019s legal name is Billy.  He usually goes by Bill but that was his choice.  He would answer if someone called him Bill (his chosen nickname) *or* Billy (his name) but if someone tried to call him William or something he obviously would not.", "their problem is they don't like her for whatever reason and this is their passive aggressive way to show it", "I know a woman in her 60's called Rosie, and although I don't know if it's a nickname or her legal name, she's a prim-and-proper type woman and it certainly doesn't come across as childish or informal.  I don't get the concept at all really.", "No, they ARE calling her a different name. It would be the equivalent of someone calling me \"Kathy.\" My birth name is Kathryn, which I accepted, along with Katy or Katt, but \"Kathy\" was not my name, not something I wanted to be called, and when someone deliberately CHOOSES not to use your actual name or a preferred nickname, it's not an accident, it's disrespectful. (And happens to be one among MANY reasons I am in the process of legally ditching my birth name altogether.)", "\"WE'RE HOPING ITS NOT DEMENTIA\" I JUST SPAT OUT MY WATER LMAOOOO", "It's completely reasonable. Once is a mistake, all the time is just pure malice.\n\nThey had it coming.\n\nI also don't react on my first name, I go by my middle name. Once I've introduced myself I won't react, have had many people try that. I don't let it fly. It's not that hard to not be a jerk.", "And if they introduce you incorrectly, you can - ever so sweetly- say \u201coh no, Rose is not my name, MIL, you know that! Hi so-and-so, my name is Rosie. nice to meet you.\u201d", "I totally love that your husband does this!", "My full, legal name is Toni. My mom regretted not naming me Antonia and when I transitioned from private elementary to public middle school, just registered me as Antonia without telling me. Role call on the first day was so awkward, as I realized the teachers were calling my \"name.\" I was so pissed at my mom and made her call in and fix it. Sorry your inlaws won't respect this!!", "I had a friend named Sam, and in grade 8m our socials teacher tried to call him Samuel, and he refused to answer to it. The name on his birth certificate was Sam", "I know someone who named their little girl Andie, and she's not an Andrea.  But it suits her - she looks like an Andie!", "Figure out how you'll handle them calling your son a name not his own. You know it will happen! They don't deserve relationships with either of you with this level of disrespect.", "As someone whose full first name is frequently shortened in a way I hate, who had a Grandma Rose and an aunt/godmother named Rosie, not only are you NTA, you are a boss. I despise people that do not respect how you want to be called. You can call me by my first name, you can call me LP, but do not come at me with something I don't like and is not my name. And hating on Rosie is just....it's a lovely name! It's the nickname we use on my youngest, as we gave her the middle name of Rose. You keep it up!", "I think it's important to do everything you can to make people like this unhappy. Because their unhappiness is something they fabricate, over something completely benign. Name every kid you have something short or informal. Also, whatever their names are, you should call them a more formal version of it.", "You should tell them it's short for Rolodex.", "My aunt named her son will not William just will. People lose their minds over the idea that will is not short for anything", "Nothing is wrong with them at all. Just generally, Jenny is short for Jennifer or similiar, and Billy is short for William etc. The point is to name them something that is usually a nickname as a jab.", "this is the right answer but i\u2019m petty and would definitely just fuck with them back", "This has no bearing on OP's name, but...\n\n* Rosie O'Donnell is short for Roseann\n* Rosie Perez was born Rosa Perez\n* Rosie Cooper is short for Rosemary\n* Rosie Scott is Rosie Scott. \n* Rosie Cavaliero is short for Rosalind.", "I agree with this, best to just be matter of fact about it. \"Actually, my name is Rosie\". If they can't act like adults, you can. That approach can sometimes be more aggravating to the other party than taking the petty road.", "r/namenerds", "yep, another Amanda here who is definitely NOT a Mandy :)", "Lol thank you! Haha", "I had a college teacher who wouldn\u2019t pronounce my name correctly, always something similar but not correct. My name is easy and not even a culturally different name. I corrected her several times before choosing to ignore her. When she\u2019d call my name and look at me expectantly, I\u2019d say \u201cthere is no one in this class with that name. My name is\u2026\u201d. My brother had to do the same thing. Its just not that hard to use someone\u2019s correct name.", "\u201cWe named him Dexter. After the tv serial killer.\u201d Just to be people to can it.", "Your point? They all go by Rosie in a professional capacity and are clearly adults. That is clearly their preferred name. We call them that bc that is the name they have expressed they want to be called.", ">I only want to share my opinion but no one can disagree, question, or share theirs \n\nThey really shouldn't let children on reddit.", "The long term solution is her husband\u2019s parents grow the fuck up and use OP\u2019s formal given name.", "No this isn't helping. What kind of atmosphere are the parents making for their grown child and future grandchildren? It is not ops responsibility to \"keep the peace\". It is the responsibility of the other grown adults to call someone by their name. Or maybe they won't be seeing the grandchildren at all since they can't respect OP with the literal most basic sign of respect that exists.", "Verruca Salt is what it reminded me of. The 90s band that sang Seether., the song not the band Seether.", "Mehitabel (f) and Murgatroyd (m).  Have you tried wearing a name tage every time you see them?  I think it would be hilarious and hammer the point home that you aren't family to them and they don't seem to remember your name.  Definitely do it at events others will be attending.", "Usually when someone starts with \"Not all...\" it's because it's them and they want to deflect.\n\nFor examples see:\n\nNot all men.\n\nAll lives matter.", "Very valid point.", "Ageist twaddle.  \n\nAre all Black Boomers self-righteous?

One time I was working on transcribing a video of a court proceeding, the situation was pretty tense and people on edge.

He gives his first name as \"Aaron, like A-A-Ron...\" various people in the room laughed, the judge put his head in his hands and his shoulders started shaking.  It took about a minute for everyone to regain composure.  \n\nFor many accents in the US, Aaron and Erin sound alike.
