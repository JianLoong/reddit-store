On these nights it isn't unusual for my neighbors' driveway to have upward of 7-10 cars parked at their house. On two different occasions before tonight I've come home from work late at night and had to walk next-door and ask them to move their car so I could pull into to my own home.

I don't think anyone is even home either because I honked and knocked on their door and nobody answered. I feel like the only options I have are to either call to have them towed or to leave things how they are and let them deal with working on my schedule if they're going to be using my property.

I don't know if you are allowed to put a barrier across the front of the drive - such as a gate or a  big plastic coated yellow chain - to physically highlight the fact and so that if they go to release the barrier they have to stand in front of the sign to do so?
