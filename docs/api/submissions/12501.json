When everything basically exploded, I was on day 3 of a fever with salmonella, unmedicated, and was surprised with a package from the kid's (2 and 4mo) great grandma (70). Well, GGMIL wanted video taken of us opening the box with the littles and seeing their reaction. I said I would take the video because I felt and looked like death. Despite saying this a couple times, MIL took my phone to video us all together. I sit and hold my youngest, try to look peppy so this is a happy video and we don't remember the sickness. (Y'all, I failed bad, I was slow blinking like Muffin from Bluey when she dropped her midday nap.) Anyway, my husband pulls out this beautiful hand knit blanket. My eyes lit up and I smiled, I didn't expect the blanket to be ready as I hadn't heard about it since we last saw her with it before she moved out of state. It made me miss the other hand knit blankets his family gifted us, I have this ottoman full of them in storage from our oldest's baby shower, so I commented while smiling \"We have so many of these\" when my husband said \"You can never have enough either!\" I heartily agreed. I was trying to think of the names of everyone else who gave us a knit blanket to thank, but we were moving on to gifts for our toddler. I followed along, figuring I'll write a thank you email later and tried to be in the background in the moment since in my mind the video was about the kids.\n\nAfter everything, I quit pretending and passed out for a few hours while I could. While this was happening, MIL had been fuming. She took my husband outside and said \"I need to talk to you about your wife! I think it was disgusting how ungrateful of an asshole she is!\" He defended me and tried to give context but it was in one ear and out the other I guess.\n\nI didn't know until later that night after we got home from helping her haul things to the dump that she stopped me and asked \"You don't have anybody old in your family do you? No, you don't really have much family. We'll, do you know what arthritis is? It's when your fingers in your hands lock up and it hurts to even use your hands. Your babies GREAT GRANDMOTHER slaved for hours making that blanket. What you're going to do is take photos of both of your kids together, because she doesn't have enough of those, and you're going to show them with that blanket and send them to her. You need to be grateful and show some gratitude.\"\n\nY'all, I hadn't even seen the video yet or even know what I did, and she's scolding me I\ninfront of my own kids and talking to me in a tone like I'm mentally impaired.

I'm amazed at your forbearance.\n\n\"What you're going to do\" is not her province to dictate. You played along with her photo opportunity, you hauled trash to the landfill for her, and *then* she jumped down your throat with boots on. She's an ingrate and a bully. I sincerely hope your moving day is SOON.\n\nUntil then, tell your hubs that you will not be dealing with his mother more than absolutely necessary, and he is now in charge of MIL Relations. You're out. Seriously, if she \"stops you\" alone anywhere again, WALK AWAY: \"*Sorry Leslie, this is not a good time for a chat*\". Be as pointed about it as you like. Her utter rudeness has begat rudeness, and she has lost the privilege of private chats with you. \n\nWhen you're moved to do so, you could write Great Granny a sweet TY note that thanks her profusely, and says two other things for damage control:\n\n* we are so blessed to have been given blankets from Marnie and Essie and Francine in the past -- all are treasures, as is yours, and they will be lovingly passed down to the kids; and\n* I haven't seen the video because MIL insisted on being the camera person, but hope I didn't look super frightening as I was on Day 3 of food poisoning!!

Now get out of that house!!!", "NTA, but I think your comment about having \"so many of these\" could be caught the wrong way, if you wanted to, and your MIL definitely wanted to. I think it is a good thing you are going to move out. These multigenerational homes aren't always what they are cracked up to be.", "NTA.\nYour MIL overreacted with her language and tone.\nBut I agree that your comment was not nice. I would be sad too if someone said that, no matter how they meant it.\nWrite her an email that reaches her before the video does and I hope it'll be fine. Also tell her of your sickness so she knows why you look or sound odd.", "Nta at all. What jerks they all are", "ESH, at least you and MIL. I understand you were sick, but knowing you were being videotaped, you must understand that saying \"We have so many of these\" is tantamount to saying you don't like the gift and don't want it. Clearly you were impaired. (And I too have been given a bunch of fuzzy handknit blankets that we don't use, so I get it.)\n\nYour MIL is also TA because she didn't have to be so aggressively rude about it. Knowing that you were not feeling well, she could have been a bit more understanding and said \"Oops, we probably don't want to send the video with that comment.\" And she could have stopped taping and asked for a re-do, or edited that part out.\n\nNo need to send that section of the recording to the GMIL.", "> \"We have so many of these\u201c\n\nBruh\n\nYTA", "NTA.  MIL went overboard for nothing. \n\nYou did misstep with your comment about \"having so many of these.\" That isn't what a gift-giver would want to hear....", "NTA.
