When everything basically exploded, I was on day 3 of a fever with salmonella, unmedicated, and was surprised with a package from the kid's (2 and 4mo) great grandma (70). Well, GGMIL wanted video taken of us opening the box with the littles and seeing their reaction. I said I would take the video because I felt and looked like death. Despite saying this a couple times, MIL took my phone to video us all together. I sit and hold my youngest, try to look peppy so this is a happy video and we don't remember the sickness. (Y'all, I failed bad, I was slow blinking like Muffin from Bluey when she dropped her midday nap.) Anyway, my husband pulls out this beautiful hand knit blanket. My eyes lit up and I smiled, I didn't expect the blanket to be ready as I hadn't heard about it since we last saw her with it before she moved out of state. It made me miss the other hand knit blankets his family gifted us, I have this ottoman full of them in storage from our oldest's baby shower, so I commented while smiling \"We have so many of these\" when my husband said \"You can never have enough either!\" I heartily agreed. I was trying to think of the names of everyone else who gave us a knit blanket to thank, but we were moving on to gifts for our toddler. I followed along, figuring I'll write a thank you email later and tried to be in the background in the moment since in my mind the video was about the kids.\n\nAfter everything, I quit pretending and passed out for a few hours while I could. While this was happening, MIL had been fuming. She took my husband outside and said \"I need to talk to you about your wife! I think it was disgusting how ungrateful of an asshole she is!\" He defended me and tried to give context but it was in one ear and out the other I guess.\n\nI didn't know until later that night after we got home from helping her haul things to the dump that she stopped me and asked \"You don't have anybody old in your family do you? No, you don't really have much family. We'll, do you know what arthritis is? It's when your fingers in your hands lock up and it hurts to even use your hands. Your babies GREAT GRANDMOTHER slaved for hours making that blanket. What you're going to do is take photos of both of your kids together, because she doesn't have enough of those, and you're going to show them with that blanket and send them to her. You need to be grateful and show some gratitude.\"\n\nY'all, I hadn't even seen the video yet or even know what I did, and she's scolding me I\ninfront of my own kids and talking to me in a tone like I'm mentally impaired. I left to the basement to cry and write the thank you email to my GMIL. The more I think about it though, the less I think I'm the asshole because this was sprung on me, and I never got to explain myself before she dumped on me. AITA?\n\nUpdate: I called GGMIL and it went to voicemail. My husband called in case she didn't recognize my number, and she picked up saying she was in the car and on her way home, can she call back at a better time. Cool, that made sense. A little while later, she calls him back and he explained and thanked her on our behalf, he was laughing and smiling when he found me so I guess things were okay! He put me on speaker so I could say thank you myself, but she had to go so she could paint a room in her house. I wasn't surprised, she's remodelling her house (she's a construction worker and tougher than an ox, utterly amazing) and she's not happy unless she's busy. I wish I could have talked to her, but she has our email and my husband was able to smooth things over.

I sewing machine gave up before getting any completely done, at that time I couldn't afford to replace it.  I gifted them as they were with the understanding they would be the first things completed when I was able to get a new(er) machine with our tax refund.

It doesn\u2019t sound like she was even that rude to you,  she wanted you to understand the physical toll it took to make the blanket and to make sure you corrected your initial reaction by showing appreciation.  Maybe she could have approached it not around your kids (though at 2 and 4mo were they even aware this was happening?)

I accept that and am working to make it better. I am seeing better that there was nothing redeeming it even with context.\n\nEdit: replaced a bad word.

I wanted to acknowledge the outpouring of love from so many members of his family. In my heart at the time, I wasn't trying to be mean.

How much it means to know the kids have their GGranny's binky right there to snuggle into now and forever.  And you wish you hadn't been so sick on the day the gift was opened because you didn't get to enjoy the experience as much as you would have liked (but you get a nice dose of the experience every day watching the littles with the blanket).

If you do it in a nice letter, you'll say what you want to say to her, and she'll have solid proof that MIL is full of crap, lol.", "I'm so socially awkward too and I thought of it in my terms \"I have so many books and this will be such a wonderful addition the the collection\" or \"ahh I have so many blankets from my great grandmother and now I get to add this into my cherished collection and memories.\" Looking at it objectively I can see where it may come off wrong but there was no harm or malice and tying to properly talk when sick is hard. \n\nI'm sick and in bed and yesterday drug myself into work and forgot my coworkers name 3 times in the same sentence to another coworker.", "If you want to spin it, talk about how the blanket instantly made you feel loved and reminded you of all the other love you\u2019ve received from friends and family and, in your sleepless and sickened state that was such a comforting thought that you got lost in it and only realized afterwards how poorly you communicated that.", "How is this a better statement at all? I'm very confused how now that you are well you still think you would have wanted to make that statement. When you write thank you notes, do you list everybody else who gave a gift in each note? The point of the video was to react to and give thanks for the current blanket.", "I looked at the video of myself. My eyes lit up and I had a huge smile before saying something stupid. I'll be tripping over myself to show my appreciation. On behalf of your family member, I'm sure it was absolutely beautiful and peice of fine craftsmanship. You're a wonderful person for your craft and dedication. We collect blankets like car seats collect cheerios, and I would have been honored to have been gifted one of your's.", "Your husband and mil are the asshole for this alone", "Just add in \u201cand each one is so special to us\u201d because it sounds like each and every one is special to you.", "I relate so hard haha. When I\u2019m sick, super tired, or over stressed I have a harder time with masking and my communication skills seem to be the first thing to go. The flat affect comes in full force and stringing together a sentence seems to take the same amount of effort as pushing a stalled car.", "Maybe the people giving the gift shouldln't force a sick person to put on a performance for their own benefit. When someone gives you a gift, it's supposed to be an act of selflessness, of giving, of love. These sorts of people aren't doing it for that. They're doing it for their own performative self-gratification. Someone who was giving it out of kindness would have just given it and maybe asked later how they liked it. Forcing someone who's very sick with a fever to do a fucking unboxing video for their viewing pleasure is being a dick. And if that feverish person is out of it in that video, they shouldn't get mad.", "Have you ever had a fever for 3 days or been poisoned? Your brain is toast, thinking and being coherent are out of the realm of possibility for a few days.", "why does she have to be grateful for the million damn blankets she's gotten? like their only so much shit you can give someone before their \"uh thanks for the effort but i dont need anymore\"", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02at the collecting blankets comment. I have a ton of handmade blankets from family members as well. I love handmade items no matter how big or small and I will likely tear up if not actually dry over receiving a beautiful handmade item as a gift. My husband is of the \u201canother blanket?\u201d Camp because we have sooo\u2026many of them but the ones made just for us are so precious to me and he definitely appreciates the time, artistry, and effort it takes to make them, even if we are practically drowning in blankets\ud83d\ude02", "I agree 100% it seems neurotypical  people will sometimes look for hidden meaning or motive behind words but I\u2019ve said stuff like this before because it makes me happy too like your ducks idk why it would be a backhanded thing considering op smiled and then said it", "You\u2019re being really aggressive to Great Grandma and it doesn\u2019t seem like she deserves it! Blame MIL, but don\u2019t take it out on the 70 yo with arthritis who likely didn\u2019t demand a video and didn\u2019t know OP was sick", "Ahhhhh. I'm on the spectrum, and it never occurred to me it could be a neurotypical vs neurodivergent thing. That makes way more sense.", "NTA, and you should let her know that using the phrase \"slaved for hours\" is pretty problematic, especially when applied in the way it was.", "I was taking \u201cwe have so many of these\u201d in a counting our blessings kind of way until MIL interrupted her", "She's from a different generation so I want to give her grace. I do have issues with a good few things she says, but I don't think there is intended hate so I don't fuss. When you want to maintain a relationship with someone, it can be tiring to have somebody police and knit pick your word choices so I don't want to be that person to retrain her lexicon. It's just this time was outwardly rude and hurtful compared to other times.\n\nMaybe this part is what really makes me the asshole.", "Ngl your update had me in stitches.  MIL is lecturing you about arthritis while grandma is literally rebuilding her house with her own hands.", "Girl you were sick ASF. I feel like I would have 100% been you in this situation. I would have said something that in my mind seemed right but it comes out all wrong and when I knew it was coming out wrong I wouldn't have the strength to fix it. \nThat bit about you MIL saying you have no old family stings though! That's not a nice thing to throw in someone's face.", "That really comes down to tone though. Said flatly or with annoyance, then yes that could be taken as rude easily, but the way I read it (and imagined it being said in my head) was more with the affect of \"omg I'm so excited I have a bunch of these and now I have another to add to the collection I love it!\" Without being able to hear OP's tone first hand it's hard to say how easy it would be to misinterpret her meaning.", "Can be hard to word something the way you want to when you have a fever and someone is waving the phone in your face and interrupting you.  NTA", "I'm talking about the grandmother who was the one who put on this whole charade.", "Grandma (MIL) wasn\u2019t the one giving the gift.", "Right, but she's the one who made it a production.", "Agreed. But your entire comment is about how the person giving the gift wanted a performance, it should be selfless act, etc.  The entire comment is criticizing the character of the gift giver.", "My comment was about the act of making gift giving a self-serving performance, which is what the grandmother did. Great grandmother was the one who made the gift (and she DID demand video be taken so she could see the reactions, so she's not entirely in the clear), but she wasn't the one who presented it. The grandmother is the one who gave the gift in person and the one who made it a whole song and dance.", "I have SO MANY BOOKS, like thousands, and I like it that way. I get really excited when everybody gives me books for Christmas. I definitely say things like, \u201cI got so many books!\u201d to my husband in a tone of glee. It\u2019s a nice thing. I\u2019d probably say the same thing about hand-knitted blankets if I got a whole bunch, because I love hand-made blankets and currently only have one. \u201cWe have so many blankets now!\u201d in a tone of joy. \n\nI love books, I love blankets, I always want more books and blankets. \u201cWe have so many of these now!\u201d would be a positive statement 100%, coming from me.", "Honestly I think MIL and a lot of people in these comments are blowing up what you said into something way worse then it really was and I don't think you even did anything wrong in the first place. \n\nOut of context, isolated, with no indication of tone or body language, the statement \"we have so many of these\" can definitely be a rude response to a gift. But half of communication is nonverbal communication and context so you can't just isolate the phrase and say you were absolutely horrible for even uttering the words.\n\nIf you were visually delighted by the gift, your eyes lit up and you had a big smile on your face before you said it then I don't see how anyone could see that as a disparaging remark in any way shape or form unless they were purposefully trying to understand your comment in bad faith.  Not only that but your comment was followed by your husband saying \"you can never have enough\" and you enthusiastically agreeing. How anyone would leave that interaction thinking you didn't want another blanket is mind boggling to me.\n\nI have a feeling that if MIL hadn't made a big deal out of it herself, GGMIL wouldn't have taken the comment as a negative or even thought twice about it. MIL just wanted to pick a fight about something and she decided a bad-faith misinterpretation of your words while you were sick was the way to go."]}
