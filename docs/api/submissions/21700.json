I asked my mom about the vacation and what we might do in July. 2.) She interpreted this as me being spoilt because I was expecting to go somewhere.

My guess is that there is some stressor going on with your parents, and it's affecting thoughts of a family vacation, and your mom took it out on you.  Mind you, whatever it is may not be \\*serious\\*, she might have had a fight with your dad, or one of her friends might be having some drama, or one or both of them might be having to spend a lot of time at work.  You just happened to pick a bad time to ask (and there was no way for you to know that).  I would give it a little time, and see if you can get a read on what they might be stressed about.  I'm not saying you need to be able to read their minds, but there may be context clues here that you're missing.  While you shouldn't \\*have\\* to read those in a relationship, getting a sense of mood from context is often helpful in all sorts of relationships.", "NTA.

She feels defensive about it and sometimes when people ask about sensitive things we don\u2019t put our best face forward. You\u2019re 17. They might be looking at the budget bc of college, bc stocks have went down, interest rates up, etc. maybe surprise them w pizza and a movie.

Was it a one-time question or were you annoying about it?", "Also good point lol", "NTA but it seems likely that your parents are stressed about either work, time, or money. They might not have the time to get away from work this summer or decided to not spend at least $8k on a vacation to Cancun or WDW. Many parents at this time of summer are feeling frustrated and running out of time for making vacation plans. That\u2019s probably why your mom snapped at you. You\u2019re old enough that they should be able to communicate the issues, but you\u2019re also old enough to understand that maybe life has gotten in the way this year and to learn to read between the lines.", "NTA. Tough luck about your dad going all in on bitcoin.", "Yeah, NTA but the string of changing plans and the angry reaction when asked just screams financial troubles they don't want to worry a kid with. I'd let it go, not press them on it and make plans with friends. Things might be really not great right now.", "Agreed. NAH.", "She\u2019s probably frustrated for some reason.", "This is the first time this has ever happened. When it comes to trip planning, my parents are usually on top of it. It honestly all falls on my mom. She's planned every single last one of our vacations while my dad \"does his part\" by working lots of overtime.\n\nJust this past May, they took a week long vacation to South America, so pushing plans, ( and not planning plans ) is super out of character, especially when the plans are being talked about.", "I had brought it up multiple times (probably about 3) throughout the week. But I was never aggressive or persistent with it.", "In that case, I'd say NAH. Nothing wrong with asking, given that plans have been discussed, but there might be something else going on this that's making it a sore subject, so I'd tread carefully if you talk about it again."]}
