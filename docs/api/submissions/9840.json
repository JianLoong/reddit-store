However, unlike your girlfriend the guy in the meme doesn't burden someone with his asinine thoughts in the form of an interrogation where the *correct* answer is neither clear nor reasonable and the consequences of getting it wrong are him throwing a daylong sulk about it.\n\nThis is just ludicrously immature behaviour on all fronts from your girlfriend, and the upping of the ante the next day after you shut that shit down makes me think there is either something genuinely wrong with her that she needs either to communicate or seek therapy for, or she's being manipulative and the crying as well as the not talking are just malicious tactics to get the response you're currently giving. After all, silent treatments are always about squeezing pity, guilt, and submission out of the victim.\n\nThe fact is you weren't petty, you were frustrated by yet another evening leading into a drama riddled day following.
