Have you talked to her or your mom about getting that checked out?", "NTA. But I don't think you can trust your grandma. Not because she wishes you harm, but it sounds like she has vision and cognitive problems that might not be obvious from a short visit, but over days you're definitely seeing more of them.

You are NTA for not wanting to get poisoned/to eat meat.", "NTA, but it sounds like you may have to grow up quickly and start cooking your own meals.", "Hey OP, if it was a sealed bottle it's probably not her fault. I've had times when I bought a case of soda from the supermarket, opened the sealed bottle, poured it in a glass with ice, only to discover mold floating in it. Totally confused by where it came from, I was trying to figure out if it was in the glass or something. When I glanced at the bottle there was a bunch still in there. I inspected the other bottles and found 2 others with mold floating in it.\n\nNot expired or anything, just got a batch that had obviously been contaminated. I've had the same thing happen with juices, milk and even some dry goods. What I'm saying is that as bad as the experience was, she might not have actually been at fault for not knowing that the bottles of iced tea were contaminated, at least not at any greater fault than you were for not checking the first bottle before drinking it. Sometimes it's just a really unfortunate accident. \n\nRegarding the whole vegan thing, I know that it can suck to find something in your food that you don't eat, but honestly the whole vegan thing is pretty new to many people. She probably grew up her whole life never knowing that it was a thing, and probably doesn't even fully grasp what it's about.\n\nIf we're being truly brutally honest, many vegans don't even realize that most food are contaminated with animal parts, and if you really start looking at everything around you, it becomes nearly impossible to actually live a life that does not involve any harm to animals. I figure that what people who hold those ideals should be focused on, is trying to do their best to not personally intentionally cause any harm.\n\nAdditionally I hope that you aren't just doing it willy nilly, and have a nutritionally sound diet, because it's really easy to do some serious damage to your long term health if you aren't careful. A lot of vegan adults struggle to get a proper balance in their diets, so I worry about any youngsters who choose to try to follow that lifestyle.\n\nI wish you good luck.", "I went through this with my great grandma.

Grandmas are supposed to care about their grandkids to at least enough of an extent that they wouldn't knowingly do things that could harm them. Depending on how long it has been since you stopped eating meat and animal products your nana can make you physically ill by feeding you real meat. \n\nEdit to remove last sentence as I see you said the milk part isn't intentionally. \n\nIf your grandma is unable to take proper care of herself she needs someone to help her or to go into an assisted living facility. She is failing to do basic care requirements, she will make herself sick along with everyone else if she doesn't get help with this. Tell your mother about these issues from the health standpoint and ask her to please help grandma. \n\nIf you feel up to it go through the perishable food stuff and remove expired or moldy items.

Take your own special cup (I have a Starbucks cup with lid I use all the time I love it) \n\nI\u2019m sure she meant well but old ppl have a terrible habit of keeping old mouldy food and keeping things past their dates it\u2019s a generational things because they grew up with less but it can actually be dangerous. :(  \n\nI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to fall out with your nana but it\u2019s ok to want to be safe and not eat mould and your dietary requirements are also important. \nHope you get it all sorted.", "I don't know how common it is around the world, but there is a specific kind of bug that when it is killed it releases a really bad smell that everyone with a nose will notice. It is called a stink bug. I once partially ate a stink bug by an accident, because my grandma didn't properly wash the lettuce for the salad and I was honestly quite pissed. However I was more pissed about her complete dismissal over not being able to smell anything wrong when I brought the dead stink bug close to her nose. Probably, because I was a kid and kids are not believed for anything. I didn't say anything rude nor was I judgemental. Thankfully my maternal uncle was with us and I brought it close to his nose and he confirmed that it was a stink bug. I just kinda went from being pissed to whatever when she reminded me that she probably can't notice the smell, because she used to work in a factory that uses different chemicals and elements to produce bombs. \n\nAt least I experienced something that most humans won't and that is tasting a stink bug. Does it taste as bad as it smells? Yes, I can confirm\n\nI understand that it can be very frustrating, but you could forgive your grandma. She probably doesn't see well.", "NAH I will say older people sometimes have a hard time telling when food has gone bad. My grandma sometimes will recook leftovers that sat for several nights on the counter in the crock pot. Same with drinking somewhat spoiled milk. I've had to start being really on top of the fridge and other things because she'll have her stuff go bad and still eat it and I worry sometimes. I think your grandma is trying her best but isn't getting that the tea is bad. Maybe try talking with her, say you're worried for her health as her tea has mold etc.", "But OP is injured! She can\u2019t go through a fridge right now! Her mom needs to come home and help Grandma and save OP.", "...after her injured hip heals, right? Sorta the whole point of being cared for by nana...", "I'm injured pretty badly, I ripped a tendon in my hip so it's very painful", "Grandma trying to speed run The Last Of Us any% (iced tea skip)", "Seems its unintentional, the milk glass thing could be because she is used to living alone so doesn't feel the need to wash her glasses often as she is fine with using the same one for multiple drinks. I myself am fine with drinking juice/coke from the same glass for a day.\n\nThe sausage might confusion due to old age/forgetting small details.\n\nNTA for both since OP is saying they were accidents but its clear grandma needs a diagnosis and might be getting Alzheimer's.", "She didn't do it on purpois", "Not eating for 2 days won\u2019t kill you. Moldy rotten food WILL.", "Does she hate that you\u2019re vegan? Bc I\u2019ve seen ppl put milk/animal proteins in food/drinks before too out of spite or as a prank. But yeah if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s on purpose at all you need to have some serious talks w other adults in your family about this, I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal w such a tough situation. Good luck OP", "Eww giving guests a glass of.water from a used milk glass is quite gross even if you are older or live alone. No excuse.", "She definitely doesn't have alzhimers but she does have adhd", "Is this a dolphin joke?", "OK, I ripped a tendon in my hip. My nana is fine and doesn't have any sores", "It has been an accident every time, she often forgets to wash out cups and glasses or just puts them in the cubboard, so sometimes there is moldy milk in the glass", "I've been vegan since I was 8 and became lactose intolerant at 7,im not drinking milk lol", "would you rather they poison themselves?!", "A lot of elderly people may not have been diagnosed yet, but are starting to get confused, illogical, etc. And no one is an AH because of age or disease., No one is an AH for something they can't control.", "I never said she has alzhimers, she doesn't have any disabilities apart from hypermobility", "I assumed OP would mention if the animal protein her grandmother sneaked into her food had caused actual harm or discomfort as that would have made her case stronger. Since OP did not, seems like veganism is her preference, not a medical need.", "Obviously I think the mom needs to handle this. If not, maybe she can seek help from an aunt, etc to intervene.", "She has quit a lot of money, but she is retired", "That you know of...", "It was an accident, as I have said on 3 other seperate occasions", "Nta. But she probably can't tell its old. My grandma gets like that too because she grew up in the depression. Just throw away the expired or rotten food when she isn't looking.", "Is anyone else bothered by the fact that OP's mother has a badly injured child, left her with someone whose ability to care for the child seems questionable, and refused to come get her injured child so she could stay at a hotel with her boyfriend? Because I'm pissed as hell by that.", "NTA Granny needs a visit from adult protective services.", "NTA, not everybody likes Kombucha.", "Yta, you trully didn't realize your mom and her boyfriend were pawning you off on an old lady who needs help herself? Sad that you expected your mom to assist you, and be an ah to the one who is actually trying. How about look at what your eating drinking yourself if you know your grandma has issues. You sound very immature still", "[removed]", "If you are healthy and your immune system is functioning properly, you don't have to worry if you accidentally eat some mould. Depending on the amount consumed and your physical condition, you may not experience any symptoms at all or you may experience unpleasant side effects such as an upset stomach.\n\nIt may also be that your symptoms are psychosomatic. It is simply disgusting to realise that you have eaten mould.\n\nYou should drink a lot (without mould ;) ) and not worry about it. You would have to eat mould for a long time for it to be harmful.", "im on crutches so its quite difficult. i really like making food but i just cant atm.", "mold can kill?  \ni looked it up and it said it cant really  \ni fricking hope it cant", "the hotel was a gift from her boyfriend's mom and i was prepayed so they cant get a refund", "and my mom is a really nice person.  \nlisten, you know the phrase \"someone that you hate unconditionally is the child of a loving family\" this applies to me, my mom and her boyfriend are the nicest people that you will never meet", "you can be nicer, although, you sound very immature.  \nand 75 isnt old, the sense to 3 year olds must be off", "i feel a lot better now, just feel a bit sick now, and kinda hard to breathe but thats pobbably because i have asthma, thank you for the comment :), have a good day (\uff5e\uffe3\u25bd\uffe3)\uff5e", "I'm so embarrassed...I thought I was replying on a thread about someone not wanting to pay their aunt's college ...this was a mistake reply.\n\n\nYou are NTA.

But from what you said, you continued to be angry with her, and this wasn't the first time.", "the thing is she has been tested for dementia, alzheimers and a bunch of other stuff and she passed all of them"]}
