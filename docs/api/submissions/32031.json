Before leaving for college, I got a matching tattoo with my mother on my pinky finger. It\u2019s basically a red band that\u2019s supposed to reference the Chinese myth called the \u201cThread of Fate\u201d, how an invisible red thread connects you to the ones you love. Needless to say, the tattoo has a very significant meaning when it comes to the relationship with mother.\n\nI met my current roommate Lynn (19F, white) last year through friends, although we were mostly acquaintances for most of our freshman year. Dorming for this year was super frustrating and competitive, but I was relieved I was able to room with someone I knew like Lynn.\n\nAll of our friends got together for a housewarming party and we started playing Jack Box (specifically the Faker game) to get to know each other better. One of the questions I was called out for being the faker was, \u201cRaise your hand if you have a tattoo.\u201d Lynn was confused why everyone said I had a tattoo, as it\u2019s not very noticeable, so I showed it to her and briefly explained its meaning. She said how cool and meaningful it was and enjoyed the simplicity of the tattoo. I thought that was the end of it as the topic wasn\u2019t brought up again.\n\nThis week was our finals, so admittedly I was already very stressed. We were cleaning the dorm together to prepare for the break, when I noticed Lynn had gotten an identical tattoo to mine. I was pretty shocked by it, especially since I didn\u2019t hear anything from her about getting it. I confronted her about it, and she defended herself by saying, \u201cIt looked cool\u201d and that \u201cher mom and her liked the meaning\u201d. The fact that she got it with her own mother made me even more upset, as my tattoo was very specific to my upbringing and made it feel less special. I told her she needed to get it removed or I\u2019m moving out. She called me an asshole and we haven\u2019t spoken since. Our friends are split on the issue, with some saying I\u2019m the asshole for trying to control what\u2019s on her body and coming off rude and others saying she overstepped by stealing a meaningful tattoo of mine.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: So far from what I see I\u2019m the asshole for suggesting she remove it. I didn\u2019t really think of what removing it would entail, as it was a heat of the moment thing I said. I wouldn\u2019t have cared if she had already had the tattoo as I\u2019m aware it\u2019s a common tattoo, but to copy me especially when she was aware of the recent health complications my mother has had this year just made me very upset.

There you go, someone else who thinks it is weird.", "It\u2019s okay if you didn\u2019t find it weird, but some people don\u2019t think inspiration is a form of flattery. Moreover she didn\u2019t say anything to the OP about being inspired by her until the OP saw it herself and confronted her, so it probably added salt to the wound. She\u2019s entitled to feel annoyed. The only thing I agree with is that she was out of line asking her to remove it.", "Its actually INCREDIBLY weird.  She wasnt \u201cinspired\u201d by the tattoo and then got a similar one, she got the exact same one including OPS NAME IN CHINESE CHARACTERS.  Thats not only weird, thats downright cookoo bananas\n\n\n\u201cThe idea itself isn\u2019t unique, but the design was picked out by my mother and I. It\u2019s a thick red band with my name the adoption center gave me inside in Chinese characters.

Most of the ones you're putting this blurb on were written before OP ever mentioned her name was included.  Which is why no one is referencing the name being included.", "Everyone's acting like this is some sort of huge gotcha where she's suddenly N TA but I agree. Usually this sub is better at pointing out that as soon as the YTAs pour in the story changes. And like someone else said, she, pointed out as someone who knows 0 Chinese, looked at your tattoo enough to study and describe the Chinese characters of *some random name* good enough for an artist to actually copy it???", "I have seen it done but never done it myself.", "That changes everything. Jesus lol, having your roommate's name is ridic.", "Wouldn't be surprised tbh.", "Plus she would have included that information when she was saying what made her tattoo special m", "The whole post would be worded differently if that were the case\u2026 especially since it was already edited\u2026", "Also valid.", "Some of us, sadly will never be out of that state...its is usually the first thing I think of every day, and the last thing I think of at night.

I'm looking for an amazing portrait artist near me bc I want a tat of my Great Dane. He passed a little over two years ago but he was my soul dog.

However I've had Filipino stepfamily since I was 5, and one of my besties inmy teens and 20s was Samoan so I can speak to what they've shared with me. From my perspective, half are okay w it, and half aren't. And the ones that are okay w it are only okay w it if the person getting the tat knows the history and story behind what they've chosen and not bc it's cool or pretty.", "I like your outlook. :-)", "I feel like most people are happy to share their culture.

Wish she had put that in originally.", "Exactly what I was thinking, I\u2019m calling bullshit.", "Doesnt change anything. Think of the friend as a copy cat, no class, unfriend her or whatever etc. But at the end of the day. She can tatoo whatever the hell she wants on her body and a person has no right to tell another to remove a tatoo.\n\nSo what if it is her name? How many people in this world have the same name? Does the David down the road have the right to tell the other David to change his name? OP needs to focus on what Ops tattoo means to her and her relationship with her mum and no one elses.", "For instance \u2026. \u201cMy roomate AND her mom got my name tattooed on them\u201d or something of the sort\u2026.. shockingly convenient nugget of information.", "I know that feeling. When I was at my worst I would set super short term goals related to my hobbies. Like \"okay, can't exit reality until I finish this book\" or \"gotta 100% that game before I move on\" and \"well that book was part of a series so gotta wait for the next one\" and stuff like that.

I\u2019m a kemetic pagan and the ankh is extremely important to me as it\u2019s the symbol of the deities I worship.

I do also have a semicolon tattoo as my mother and sister wanted something to get tattooed with me", "A custom butterfly of some kind, but I'd need to talk to an artist to figure out the exact design. Partially because of the chaos/death/change/rebirth meanings generally attached to them and partially because I just think they're pretty cool. Like for example during thier cocoon phase they're barely even a *creature*, they basically melt themselves down into genetic goo to turn themselves into something else entirely.\n\nAnd aw, that's a sweet memorial. But yea you would definitely need a good artist so it's recognizable.", "Right, that\u2019s why y\u2019all are arguing on a thread that judged ESH.", "I'm more on your side but to play devil's advocate, a lot of people don't necessarily like to be copied. It's self-centered sure but people like to have things about them they find unique, even if it isn't actually uncommon. \n\nI kinda relate it to when you have a shirt and then your friend buys the exact same shirt and then you decide to paint your house green and then your friend also does the same after and so on and so forth. I think tattoos are different, but like I said, feeling like being copied is an uncomfortable feeling for a lot of people.", "It\u2019s not about other people in the world having it. It\u2019s about someone you LIVE WITH copying it. I would say the same thing regardless of the tattoo. Like if I had a Spongebob tattoo and my roommate was like \u201cOh cool tattoo\u201d and then went out and got the EXACT SAME ONE on the same part of her body\u2026 that would be insane to me. OP had no right to demand she get it removed, but I can\u2019t believe how many people are saying it\u2019s normal and not at all weird to copy your roommate\u2019s tattoo. It\u2019s more clueless and weird than it is an asshole move, but it\u2019s still something I would be freaked out by if it happened to me.", "No worries you didnt misread at all, she only made that comment an hour ago so you didnt see it yet", "Oh pure spite was how I got through high-school", "I can't wear watches..

Existential spite makes for one hell of a lifeline sometimes.", "That is an absolutely wild/interesting story lol I have a cheap smart watch now, but when I got the tattoo I always wore this dainty, gold-banded thing my grandma left me when she passed, which is now put away for safekeeping. The problem is, I would never choose such a thin, delicate band myself, so now the top edge of my semicolon is constantly obscured by my watch band. Clearly didn't think that completely through haha"]}
