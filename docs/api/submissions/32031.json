Before leaving for college, I got a matching tattoo with my mother on my pinky finger. It\u2019s basically a red band that\u2019s supposed to reference the Chinese myth called the \u201cThread of Fate\u201d, how an invisible red thread connects you to the ones you love. Needless to say, the tattoo has a very significant meaning when it comes to the relationship with mother.\r  \n\r  \nI met my current roommate Lynn (19F, white) last year through friends, although we were mostly acquaintances for most of our freshman year. Dorming for this year was super frustrating and competitive, but I was relieved I was able to room with someone I knew like Lynn.\r  \n\r  \nAll of our friends got together for a housewarming party and we started playing Jack Box (specifically the Faker game) to get to know each other better. One of the questions I was called out for being the faker was, \u201cRaise your hand if you have a tattoo.\u201d Lynn was confused why everyone said I had a tattoo, as it\u2019s not very noticeable, so I showed it to her and briefly explained its meaning. She said how cool and meaningful it was and enjoyed the simplicity of the tattoo. I thought that was the end of it as the topic wasn\u2019t brought up again.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nThis week was our finals, so admittedly I was already very stressed. We were cleaning the dorm together to prepare for the break, when I noticed Lynn had gotten an identical tattoo to mine.

I confronted her about it, and she defended herself by saying, \u201cIt looked cool\u201d and that \u201cher mom and her liked the meaning\u201d. The fact that she got it with her own mother made me even more upset, as my tattoo was very specific to my upbringing and made it feel less special. I told her she needed to get it removed or I\u2019m moving out. She called me an asshole and we haven\u2019t spoken since.

I hate to inform your that the world doesn't spin around you, and you don't get to dictate what other people do, especially when it actually has nothing to do with you. The tattoo pairing you describe is not as uncommon as you imply, and for every mother/daughter father/son great-grandmother etc that has one, for all of those people, it has a deep, personal meaning. And it has nothing to do with you.\n\nImagine a planet where people keep to themselves things they find meaningful. And, in this case, this roommate found great value in the symbolism, so much so they pursued it on their own with their mother.

What about all the movies that have it? What about people who talk about it? Are you going to come after me because I reply to a forum with it? I can understand how it may be upsetting that she got it for a more casual reason than you did but how exactly does that affect you? Is yours now meaningless? Is your entire life ruined?

I will agree that copying someone's tattoo is obnoxious so maybe I'll give an ESH.", "YTA\n\nMany people get ideas for tattoos from other people's tattoos or images they see. You told her how special it felt to have it. She felt she would like to feel that simplicity and specialness too. You can't own the image or the meaning just for yourself. She is certainly free to add art to her body as she sees fit and I'm sure she really likes it and it was inspired by you. Live and let live.

Do you have any idea how many other people have the exact same tat, just in whichever color represents their cancer?? LOL SOOOO MANY! \n\nHowever, it's still an exceptionally special tattoo to me. \n\nAnd when it comes to tats, imo, that's all that matters.", ">On the other hand it\u2019s not even a unique tattoo.\n\nI'd have gone with \"On the other hand, there's no tattoo.\" Ya see, it's funny because the tattoo is on one hand... OK I'll leave now.", "> I feel like it\u2019s also insane to just take your own friend\u2019s personal tattoo and copy it identically\n\nI wouldn\u2019t personally do it, but at the end of the day who cares? I have four tattoos, and I could not care less if someone I know were to get a matching one. It\u2019s not my body. Why does it matter? I have no right to tell them what they can or cannot do with it, and it\u2019s not like this tattoo is unique only to OP. A lot of people have them. You can\u2019t gatekeep a generic tattoo design. \n\nLike I said, OP can feel however they want to feel about it, but the question posed is whether or not they are an asshole for demanding the removal of the tattoo. The answer is yes. They get no say in what someone else does to their own body. OP needs to grow up."]}
