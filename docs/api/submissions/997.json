In short, shit sucks and it's getting worse by the day . So last week, our manager did his rounds and told us that he appreciates all our hard work in spite of all this, and that he wanted the team to get together at his house the next weekend for a potluck.  \n\nNow I like my coworkers and all, but I honestly am not all too enthusiastic about spending my free time hanging out with them.  Nonetheless, I appreciated my boss's intentions and agreed to go.  When the sign-up sheet got passed around, I volunteered to make a relatively time-consuming and expensive dish to pitch in.  No big deal; again, I volunteered to make this dish.  It's a potluck - you provide what you decide to provide.  \n\nThis is where my issues comes into play.  Everyone who was coming had registered on the sign-up sheet by the end of last week.  Yesterday, the manager texted everyone who was coming.  He informed everyone that he was providing ribs for this weekend, and informed us that it would be $15 per person to come.\n\nAm I out of line for being pissed off about this? I get that meat isn't cheap right now, but no discussion of cost was held before commitments were made. Plus, I've never heard of paying to attend a potluck.  The fuck is that? If you can't afford to provide ribs, don't insist on bringing ribs and charging for them.  \n\nI just wanted to get a quick temp-check before I set off of on this slimy fucker tomorrow morning.
