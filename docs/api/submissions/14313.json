They tell us not to do it but it's just too funny.\" Anyone else who hears and sees that video won't be laughing and will be disgusted at the person recording and laughing. They can't post it online because they will get dragged like nobody's business. So do they just rewatch it and laugh? Because that sounds so........pathetic. Imagine that humiliation is funny to you.
