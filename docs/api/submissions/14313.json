This was around the same time she asked to to no longer post her on my social media without her permission. I guess I am the weird mom because \u201cdrum roll\u201d I respected her wishes and no more pics posted, I could still take as many as I wanted, thank the gods, and no more spotlighting. Unfortunately her dad passed away on her 15th birthday so after that birthday\u2019s were different.

OP needs support, encouragement, someone to talk to and the will to make her life better, and you're right, that doesn't just happen. Maybe that phrase was a bit glib. On the other hand, maybe showing enough backbone to remove herself from the situation will be enough to send a message to her family that enough is enough, but that I wouldn't bet the cash money on that.

Anyway, I don't tell people at work my birthday because I find these office dos childish and embarrassing. I don't want to tell people I don't know that well, who'll deck out my workspace with balloons and sing That Song as if I'm in primary school again. I always book annual leave on the day, or for the whole week if I've got enough accrued. Last year, I booked the day off to take my cat to the vet as she was due for a check up anyway. Next day a colleague wished me a happy birthday for the previous day and I denied it. She looked surprised and said \"Oh, boss said it was!\" I said there must have been some mistake but inside I was fuming.

If they're sharing one thing from my HR file, what else are they looking at and sharing? \n\nAnyway, I didn't get much sympathy about it because the agency said I was being \"unkind\" to their client who had \"only tried to make me feel welcome\". So what's so hard about ASKING me if I wanted my birthday shared? Most places I've worked have had an \"opt in\" policy where it's down to you to ask to be added to their public birthday list.

NTA, OP.", "My brother and I spent many years absolutely hating each other with a fiery passion, and yet even during the worst of those years, we both held to a pact that if anyone in our family tried to embarrass us on our birthday with a restaurant sing along for dessert, we would both get up and walk out in solidarity. Just the fear of us doing that in lockstep kept most of the family in line, and the few that stepped out of line learned really quickly not to do it a second time.\n\nNow that we both get along better as adults in our middle-aged years, we continue to share this story so relatives understand that our differences were personality clashes but our morality and ethics were still in sync.

They didn't make a huge deal of it but they refused to let me pay for anything and each wished me luck in lots of small moments rather than a big toast.

I know I suffer from mental health issues as well, and being home Is my safe space.  For them to record you in mental distress is disgusting! The advertisement says that it's OK not to be ok. Is it? When you have family and long-time friends who laugh and exploit your attacks on social media. Who does that? Mental health disorders are not talked about fully by people for fear of things like that happening. Instead, it will stay hidden, and go untreated until something tragic happens. You may need to find new friends or send them information about what you are experiencing.  If they don't stop then, time to find more understanding friends. I am truly saddened that you are and have gone through such situations. Shame on them. How would they feel it was them? By now they should be more informed about your situation and have more empathy.
