Leah calls Angela mom and loves her and thinks of her as just her mom, not her stepmom or anything. I never thought of Angela as a mom or a parent or anything. I always kind of wished for the marriage to break down but part of me never expected it to as well. I always knew dad still loved mom but over the years it did become obvious that dad didn't really love Angela and was with her because he thought he should move on. Dad and Angela have my two half brother's together who are 4 and 18 months old and a few months ago they started divorce proceedings and Angela moved out.\n\nThis all came about because of several slip ups where dad called Angela \"Nat\" which was my mom's name. Happened first when they were early in the marriage but got worse in the last year and a half until Angela realized dad didn't really love her. I heard a lot of the breakdown of their marriage because they fought a lot. She was really hurt and dad did eventually admit he didn't actually love her, he just tried to make himself love her and give us another mom.\n\nAfter they separated it was agreed Leah would go between Angela's and my dad's with our half brothers because Angela was mom to her. Angela and Leah both wanted me to go too but I never wanted to. Angela was never important enough for me to want to continue a relationship with her in that way. I'd have to see her sometimes and that's okay but I don't love or miss her and I don't want to be in her house where she's the only adult/parent around.\n\nLeah misses me a bunch when she's gone and asked me why I didn't want to go to \"mom's house\" and I explained Angela isn't my mom even if she's hers. Leah said don't we both have two moms. I said she does but I only have one. It really upset her and she tried to convince me I could have two moms as well.\n\nMy dad tried to talk me into it saying it would make the divorce easier on Leah and then he brought me to some therapy sessions where the therapist agreed it was not in my best interest to go. Angela was really upset and tried to plead her case. She told me she loved me and considered me her first and oldest child. \n\nDad has been pissy at me lately because Christmas was rough for Leah who spent it with Angela. She missed me and apparently they were all sad Christmas Day. I talked to Leah on the phone. But I spent Christmas with my grandparents aka mom's parents. Dad told me I should be going to Angela's house and it would be easier to make the whole transition of divorce work if I did.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704537563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zxbss/aita_for_not_going_with_my_sister_and_my_half/", "score": 805, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can be sad and upset, she's allowed to have those feelings, but she *is not* allowed to dictate my relationship or lack therof with *anyone* just to spare her feelings. This can be explained to her repeatedly and appropriately for her age by either *you* or the therapist. That is *not* and will not be my job. I think you forget that I'm fifteen and this is pretty hard for me too, regardless of my relationship with Angela. Your divorce is your own, the consequences of it needs to be managed by *you.* I am not going out of my way to upset Leah. I have been and will continue to be gentle with my rejections to her fantasies about Angela being my mother. Beyond this is *far* more than you can fairly ask of me.\n\n\"I think you need to talk to the therapist yourself on some things. These are my boundaries, I'm not breaking them, and I think for the sake of our relationship, you should put some thought into respecting them.\"\n\nThis is just a suggestion, of course. Set whatever boundaries that will make you the most comfortable. The most important thing is to calmly and clearly state them, highlight the consequences of the person not doing so, and then follow through. Do not allow the person to argue with you or over justify them.\n\nThe hard part for you is that you are fifteen. Your ability to enforce your boundaries will be limited so long as your father has the ability to punish you in any way for any perceived slights. So, tread carefully here and be prepared to be forced into visiting Angela as a worst case scenario.\n\nYou've only got three years to go, as some good news. I know they probably seem very long from where you're standing, but reaching eighteen is your light at the end of the tunnel. The ability to tell your bad parents or guardians to fuck right off is very, very sweet. Just keep that in mind if things get hard.", "NTA. It's not on you to make his divorce guilt go away. You are not required to make this easier on him. You are not her child, and she is not a mother to you. Sometimes, kids are going to be sad about living in split households. It is the nature of blended families. It is up to the parents to provide the emotional support and guidance they need, not the other child in the household.", "NTA. Your dad and Angela need to justify why they can be separated because he doesn't love her but the same doesn't apply for you. Your dad has time to himself during custody time and so should you.", "NTA.\n\nThere's no need for you to go over with the kids on a EOW/weekend or whatever the custody arrangement is as she isn't and has never been a parent to you.\n\nI do feel for her as she thought she had a marriage and family and for her to have to realise that it was all just a farce by your dad is going to hurt, but in the 6yrs they was together, she has to know the relationship with you vs the one your sister has are completely different. So it shouldn't come as too much as a shock to her that your not interested in keeping a relationship with her unless she was all about being mum to you despite you pushing back and that was ignored by her & dad.\n\nLeah struggling with the transition is something they, the adults, need to work on with her. Get *Leah* therapy to help deal with the divorce instead of taking you to one to 'make it easier for everyone' but you. Even in normal circumstances you'd mostly likely be at the age where you can choose/have a say in the custody arrangement. Cos if it isn't dealt with now, in the future when you do stop going, the problems will still arise anyway. \n\nDad has to realise that, being your *only* parent, that getting alone time or the house to himself regularly is basically a myth.", "Sounds like Dad is only interested in what\u2019s best for him, just like marrying Angela he gets a mom for his kids so he can do less.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The idea that \"children need a mother\" is very pervasive within Western culture. Consider how all ads for children's needs (diapers, medicine, back to school, etc) all feature the mother and rarely the father, and certainly never a single father. There is still the idea that men cannot care for children alone, and need a woman in their life. \n\nSo when widowed, men will often seek out a new partner because they mistakenly believe they are incapable of being parents, especially if they have daughters. \n\nWomen are more accepted as single parents of either gender children. Yeah, there's still some of that \"boys need a father\", but many people are wiling to accept an uncle or grandfather as the father figure. An aunt or grandmother as a mother figure for a boy is not as accepted. \n\nIn order for stories like this to become less common, we as a society need to do better towards our fathers, and our single fathers.", "She knew on some level but I think she had this idea that underneath it all I considered her just as much family/a parent as Leah did.

The only thing I'd encourage you to do is spend some time with your other siblings. I assume they live with their mum.

As she gets older and has more important moments in her life, she may experience anxiety or anger about you rejecting opportunities to be there for her, because Angela will also be there. By having a black and white line about your relationship with Angela, you are increasing the chances that LEAH will draw a hard, black and white line with your relationship some day. To her, you're not protecting the special relationship you had with your mother - you're hurting \\*her\\* mother, Angela.\n\nSo if you can find something workable with Angela, during this transition, it would be to the benefit of your relationship with Leah. This doesn't have to mean going over to her house for Christmas, but perhaps you, Leah, Angela, and your grandparents could periodically go to lunch or some outside activity that is limited (like an outing to an amusement park or a monthly movies get-together). Find ways to be civil for Leah's sake. This is a good conversation to have with your grandparents, or a trusted teacher, or friend of the family.\n\nThere have been several comments suggesting you show compassion to your stepmother. Compassion is not the same thing as accepting Angela as your mother or telling her you love her. It's simply trying to have some empathy for her point of view.

But not in the way at least some commenters are framing it. Like, yeah, it's possible he knowingly manipulated this woman and horribly neglects his children's feelings. It's also possible that people make really bad decisions when they don't know how to deal with grief, and that doesn't mean there's any malice behind it or that they're altogether a failure as a parent.\n\nHell, I don't know why everyone's even so quick to assume that he never really loved Angela. Because that's a 15-year-old's take on the situation? It's not possible he thought he loved this woman at one point? Even if he said himself that he didn't, he'd be an unreliable narrator. People rewrite history all the time when they need to make sense of complicated and conflicting emotions. It's easier than accepting that emotions frequently don't make much sense to begin with, or that we loved someone a bit but simply weren't ready to be with anyone just yet.

The OP has to decide whether staying at Angela\u2019s house would be more detrimental than the potential rift with his sister.\n\nTruthfully, my older sister and I didn\u2019t start to really bond until she was in college and I was in middle school.  Siblings don\u2019t need deep bonds when they\u2019re young (and often don\u2019t have them) in order to develop them over shared circumstances in the future.\n\nLeah is likely attaching her feelings of abandonment and the destruction of her family to OP because she feels like she might have more influence with him than with her parents.\n\nShe likely feels powerless against what is happening, and, as a child, it is much easier to assign your feelings of loss to a sibling than to the people you depend on for immediate care.\n\nThis may affect OP\u2019s relationship with her in the future, but it is going to do that regardless of whether OP is there or not.\n\nAgain, OP cannot control this situation.
