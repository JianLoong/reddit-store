Leah calls Angela mom and loves her and thinks of her as just her mom, not her stepmom or anything. I never thought of Angela as a mom or a parent or anything. I always kind of wished for the marriage to break down but part of me never expected it to as well. I always knew dad still loved mom but over the years it did become obvious that dad didn't really love Angela and was with her because he thought he should move on. Dad and Angela have my two half brother's together who are 4 and 18 months old and a few months ago they started divorce proceedings and Angela moved out.\n\nThis all came about because of several slip ups where dad called Angela \"Nat\" which was my mom's name. Happened first when they were early in the marriage but got worse in the last year and a half until Angela realized dad didn't really love her. I heard a lot of the breakdown of their marriage because they fought a lot. She was really hurt and dad did eventually admit he didn't actually love her, he just tried to make himself love her and give us another mom.\n\nAfter they separated it was agreed Leah would go between Angela's and my dad's with our half brothers because Angela was mom to her. Angela and Leah both wanted me to go too but I never wanted to. Angela was never important enough for me to want to continue a relationship with her in that way. I'd have to see her sometimes and that's okay but I don't love or miss her and I don't want to be in her house where she's the only adult/parent around.\n\nLeah misses me a bunch when she's gone and asked me why I didn't want to go to \"mom's house\" and I explained Angela isn't my mom even if she's hers. Leah said don't we both have two moms. I said she does but I only have one. It really upset her and she tried to convince me I could have two moms as well.\n\nMy dad tried to talk me into it saying it would make the divorce easier on Leah and then he brought me to some therapy sessions where the therapist agreed it was not in my best interest to go. Angela was really upset and tried to plead her case. She told me she loved me and considered me her first and oldest child. \n\nDad has been pissy at me lately because Christmas was rough for Leah who spent it with Angela. She missed me and apparently they were all sad Christmas Day. I talked to Leah on the phone. But I spent Christmas with my grandparents aka mom's parents. Dad told me I should be going to Angela's house and it would be easier to make the whole transition of divorce work if I did.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704537563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zxbss/aita_for_not_going_with_my_sister_and_my_half/", "score": 205, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can be sad and upset, she's allowed to have those feelings, but she *is not* allowed to dictate my relationship or lack therof with *anyone* just to spare her feelings. This can be explained to her repeatedly and appropriately for her age by either *you* or the therapist. That is *not* and will not be my job. I think you forget that I'm fifteen and this is pretty hard for me too, regardless of my relationship with Angela. Your divorce is your own, the consequences of it needs to be managed by *you.* I am not going out of my way to upset Leah. I have been and will continue to be gentle with my rejections to her fantasies about Angela being my mother. Beyond this is *far* more than you can fairly ask of me.\n\n\"I think you need to talk to the therapist yourself on some things. These are my boundaries, I'm not breaking them, and I think for the sake of our relationship, you should put some thought into respecting them.\"\n\nThis is just a suggestion, of course. Set whatever boundaries that will make you the most comfortable. The most important thing is to calmly and clearly state them, highlight the consequences of the person not doing so, and then follow through. Do not allow the person to argue with you or over justify them.\n\nThe hard part for you is that you are fifteen. Your ability to enforce your boundaries will be limited so long as your father has the ability to punish you in any way for any perceived slights. So, tread carefully here and be prepared to be forced into visiting Angela as a worst case scenario.\n\nYou've only got three years to go, as some good news. I know they probably seem very long from where you're standing, but reaching eighteen is your light at the end of the tunnel. The ability to tell your bad parents or guardians to fuck right off is very, very sweet. Just keep that in mind if things get hard.", "NTA. It's not on you to make his divorce guilt go away. You are not required to make this easier on him. You are not her child, and she is not a mother to you. Sometimes, kids are going to be sad about living in split households. It is the nature of blended families. It is up to the parents to provide the emotional support and guidance they need, not the other child in the household.", "NTA. Your dad and Angela need to justify why they can be separated because he doesn't love her but the same doesn't apply for you. Your dad has time to himself during custody time and so should you.", "NTA.\n\nThere's no need for you to go over with the kids on a EOW/weekend or whatever the custody arrangement is as she isn't and has never been a parent to you.\n\nI do feel for her as she thought she had a marriage and family and for her to have to realise that it was all just a farce by your dad is going to hurt, but in the 6yrs they was together, she has to know the relationship with you vs the one your sister has are completely different. So it shouldn't come as too much as a shock to her that your not interested in keeping a relationship with her unless she was all about being mum to you despite you pushing back and that was ignored by her & dad.\n\nLeah struggling with the transition is something they, the adults, need to work on with her. Get *Leah* therapy to help deal with the divorce instead of taking you to one to 'make it easier for everyone' but you. Even in normal circumstances you'd mostly likely be at the age where you can choose/have a say in the custody arrangement. Cos if it isn't dealt with now, in the future when you do stop going, the problems will still arise anyway. \n\nDad has to realise that, being your *only* parent, that getting alone time or the house to himself regularly is basically a myth.", "Sounds like Dad is only interested in what\u2019s best for him, just like marrying Angela he gets a mom for his kids so he can do less.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The idea that \"children need a mother\" is very pervasive within Western culture. Consider how all ads for children's needs (diapers, medicine, back to school, etc) all feature the mother and rarely the father, and certainly never a single father. There is still the idea that men cannot care for children alone, and need a woman in their life. \n\nSo when widowed, men will often seek out a new partner because they mistakenly believe they are incapable of being parents, especially if they have daughters. \n\nWomen are more accepted as single parents of either gender children. Yeah, there's still some of that \"boys need a father\", but many people are wiling to accept an uncle or grandfather as the father figure. An aunt or grandmother as a mother figure for a boy is not as accepted. \n\nIn order for stories like this to become less common, we as a society need to do better towards our fathers, and our single fathers.", "She knew on some level but I think she had this idea that underneath it all I considered her just as much family/a parent as Leah did. But I showed it differently or hadn't yet realized it. Our relationship was always different though. I never called her mom. I never invited her to anything Mother's Day related. When I did anything for school that was Mother's Day crafts or whatever I always did it for my mom and not Angela. I never introduced her and my dad as \"my parents\" and I never really went to Angela as a parent.", "Angela doesn't want to do stuff together with my dad right now and maybe she never will. I think she finds it incredibly difficult to be around dad knowing he never loved her and married her under false pretenses on her part.", "The third point I would go to my grandparents or aunts and uncles houses if dad needed space. The second is really the only consideration for me but I would be miserable if I was there every other week because I never wanted to be there.", "This is a bad take idc. Literally none of those three things is OP\u2019s problem or responsibility. They are a CHILD. It is not their job to coddle the emotions of those around them at the expense of what they are comfortable with. It is not OP\u2019s job to force themselves into an uncomfortable situation and cross their own boundaries in order to make the divorce easier on those around them.", "None of those 3 points are OPs problem they aren't the parents they are a child that shouldn't be asked again to pretend to care about someone he doesn't just because his little sister is struggling leave the kid alone ffs", "No. Full stop, no. All of your points are BS. Why does OP have to set themselves on fire to save someone else? I\u2019m not sure which of your points is the worst one because they are all so terrible. Stop trying to force this poor kid to be a people pleaser.", "Ignore all of this, none of this is your responsibility. You're a kid, it's not on you to make the divorce easier. It's on the adults.", "It's not when you consider the fact Leah would be devastated not to live with the woman she calls mom half the time at least. Really she wants them back together but she loves Angela as much as dad so it makes sense in that way.", "I don't hate her or anything. I just don't really care or have a bond and I don't want to be put back in a place where she would technically get to parent me again.", "Wow, don't guilt her.", "I honestly preferred being with my grandparents for Christmas. It would have been nice to see Leah but also kinda difficult at the same time. Christmas is a weird time for me.", "I don't love Angela and don't want to be in her place where she is then effectively my parent and the only one there. I never built that relationship with her and I don't want to start now.", "Then she knew. Continuing to try and force you to accept her as any type of parental figure now that they are divorcing is pretty pointless. There wasn't the relationship there between the two of you to begin with, and it's not going to happen now. \n\nThey both need to accept that. Your dad needs to step up now and be the parent you needed him to be when your mum passed, instead of sending you off so he gets a break from his responsibilities.", "Then this is Angela\u2019s decision and not your problem. Maybe tell Angela that you\u2019ll come if your dad comes - if you are even willing to compromise. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to take responsibility just because Angela can\u2019t swallow her pride or hurt feelings. Angela and your Dad has two children together they should be adults and put their hurt feelings aside. \n\nI think it would be very clever to show your dad your AITAH question and the comments. \n\nYour father sounds like a loving father who is maybe also still hurt after losing the love of his life. Nothing can replace your mom and he was/is probably worried of being inadequate. \nBeing a widow parent isn\u2019t easy and every time he makes a mistake he is probably thinking about how he is missing your mother. \n\nIt sounds like there are no AH\u2019s in this story, but your Dad and Angela need to put aside their issues. At least for your siblings sake.\nI also understand why Angela is hurt, I believe that she loves you and that you truly are her \u201cfirst born\u201d in her eyes. \n\nI do however have one advice for you. \n\nLove isn\u2019t easy to come by in this world and we should be careful turning our backs to love - even if she isn\u2019t your mother. \n\nWhen you grow up you\u2019ll find that life is full of heartache and bumps on the road. When we are truly in trouble we need the people who love us the most. Nobody get\u2019s through life without a loving hand and if Angela truly loves you as her first born, you should be careful to turn your back on her - even if you don\u2019t love her. \nBeing loved very important and I regret many decisions in my life, where I\u2019ve turned my back on people who loved me. \n\nWish you all the best, you are not the AH, your dad is not the AH and Angela is not the AH. \n\nIt is however their responsibility to make things work. \n\nI\u2019m sure your dad haven\u2019t thought about the pressure he is putting on you, maybe share this I\u2019m sure he will understand. \nWanting a mother for your children comes from a good place. It\u2019s sad how things have turned out, but there is an easy solution to this.", "Honestly, ignore that commentator. It's an important lesson in life to realise \n\n1.) You can't force people to love the same people as you do\n\n2.) Being raised in the same situation doesn't give you the same experience.\n\nFor example at school, you may have 2 close friends you like who both like you. *That doesn't mean they will like each other.* Are you going to pressure them into being friends because that would make your life easier? No because that's a form of bullying. What if one of your mates hated school and felt you were the only person who was nice to them. Are you going to tell them, \"actually school was the best time of your life?\" No, because that's also a form of bullying.\n\nMaybe try explain it to Leah like that. Tell her she's always welcome to spend Christmas with your maternal grandparents with you, or you can a 2nd sibling Christmas with Dad. But she can't make a decision to have a maternal relationship with Angela, with the hope that one day she'll be able to persuade you to love her too. That's not fair on anyone.", "It is not your responsibility to make the divorce easier for anyone. You are a child and it is an adult responsibility to make the transition as painless as possible. It sounds like your sister would benefit from therapy along with her parents. \nReiterate if necessary what the therapist said for your wellbeing of not going. Your father created this mess that has negatively impacted five people. Good luck and hopefully you are able to continue with therapy. I wish you the very best with this awful situation.", "This commenter is off base. You are a child yourself. You are not responsible for the needs of adults who have created this situation. You care about your sister and are kind to her, but you are not an emotional support puppet to be used to help her transition to the new reality of her life. Your mental health and happiness are your priority and everyone shouldn\u2019t be looking at you to make their lives easier. Adults must do the adulting, not you.", "\u2018Set themselves on fire\u2019\u2026 oh grow up you melodramatic fool. \n\nLife isn\u2019t one big hypothetical Reddit question. OP may be 15 but whatever they choose to do is going to have lifelong consequences so like it or not they should consider it fully.", "You are only 15, this shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility even if your dad says it will make it easier. Really they should be getting a child therapist for your sister so that it is explained to her easier. Don\u2019t let them guilt you. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, you shouldn\u2019t be involved. \n\nAnd don\u2019t let other redditors guilt you, you won\u2019t lose your sister. Just keep reminding her you love her and love that she has a different relationship towards your stepmom, but that isn\u2019t the same for you. She will understand when she\u2019s older. Just keep being her big sister. You\u2019re not her parent, leave that to your dad and stepmom."]}
