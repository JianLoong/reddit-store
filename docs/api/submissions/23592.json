Don't want baby exposed to any sicknesses in the first 2 months of life. 2. We are gonna be tired and 3. don't want to deal with 23 people at my father's, 6 people at my mother's and 24 people at the in-laws.\n\nHubby says he'll go get plates from each house if we want food but he'd like to spend as much time with his daughter since he is a carpenter and doesn't get many days off, so for her first Thanksgiving and Christmas he doesn't want anyone to pass our child around like a football.\n\nSo we told my father and he understands, he said he's still gonna invite us and if we change our minds we are welcomed. We told my mother and shes was upset and said \"don't keep the baby away from us\" we had to explain so now she kind of understands and the inlaws are upset they say we \"never come around\" FIL says \"family comes first son\" and SIL already thinks I \"stole her brother from her.\" Now she thinks I'm holding the baby away from them ( when realistically, we do visit them and they ignore us, their house is a mess, they have roaches, they always smoke cigarettes and pot, and never wash their hands.) As of rn the inlaws are trying to guilt trip with every excuse in the book.\n\nSo Will we be the assholes for not going to 3 separate families thanksgivings and Christmases? \n\n(Edit 1: There will be about 49 to 50 people all together.)\n\n(Edit 2: my bil and sister already has COVID again, they get sick very easily.)\n\n(Edit 3: More than 60% of the 49 people will be children under the age of 13.

No, your new baby, you set the standards.\n\nThere will be lots of group holidays in the years to come, this one around you\u2019re sitting out the germ-fest.\n\nIf seeing you guys for the holidays is so important each couple can visit you (with a meal and an hour of cleaning \ud83d\ude1c)  a week or so before they have the festivities if you feel up to it.\n\nAren\u2019t most of these people parents?  Do none of them remember what a 2 month baby is like?  What mom and dad feel like on that sleep/eat/poop schedule?", "NTA. You are free to choose to go to these or not, whatever your reasons are. In this case you are fully justified (not that you even need outside justification), so I wouldnt worry about it too much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI find the \"family comes first\" part so funny.

You aren\u2019t stealing anyone or not putting family first. You are prioritizing your immediate family - your new baby - and your baby\u2019s health.

You deserve it and are well within your right to set boundaries to get that.\n\nI am so sorry you feel as though you need to ask this.  You should NOT be pressured to hurry your recovery or risk the health of your baby \"FOR FAAAAAMILY\", because if they actually cared beyond themselves, they would respect that you are having a baby at THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER!  During Flu/RSV/COLD/and COVID season!  It sounds like it is your first too.  So you don't know if she will be early or late, how it will impact your body, or what your recovery will be like.  The fact that you are thinking a head is great, you are trying to manage expectations clearly and be realistic!  Stick to your guns!  Also, it is 100% acceptable to call your in-laws out for the cleanliness of their house, the use of cigarettes and THC and stick to your guns. \n\nAlso, your edit showing that over 60% of attendees will be under 13.  KIDS ARE GERM FACTORIES!   I love my niece and nephews but my DH and I always have some sort of cold after being around them during the cold weather months. They can't help it, it is just a developmental part of their life, the breed illness at that age.  Your baby and likely you and your husband haven't been around them as much while pregnant, which means you are more susceptible as well, unless you have VERY public facing jobs.", "Tell all of them to stop being such narcissists and to get over themselves.", "NTA. Family comes first is 100% correct. You, your husband and baby are your first and most important family. When you got married everyone else took a step down on the list. Stay home.

Stay home, take care of yourself and your bundle of joy, and enjoy the holidays!", "First off, congratulations and best wishes!\n\nNTA, at all. Take the time you need and want when the baby is here. Enjoy the holidays together as 3.\n\nIf they want to see you all so badly, why wouldn't they ask to come and visit at your house?\n\nAlso, 'family comes first son', such a toxic thing to say. Made me ill reading that.

Protect that baby!", "Absolutely NTA", "NTA. They can't force you to come, so if you just happen to miss out, oh well! Please don't feel bad. The first weeks postpartum are exhausting mentally, physically, etc.", "NTA AT ALL .\n\nAnd yeah, FIL, family does come first, which is why your son is protecting his by staying away during this vulnerable time.", "NTA - when I had my son - Dec 4 my in-laws fully expected me to pack the kid up and drive 3 hours one way with a newborn so they could show him off.  I caved to pressure from my husband and them and was miserable - but that was also the one and only time his great grandfather saw him - (he died a month later).  After that one year I put my foot down - what child who has just opened all his gifts wants to spend 6 hours on Christmas day in a car with people he only sees a couple of times a year?  I told the in-laws he would see them on Christmas eve and if they wanted to stop by on their way out of town to see him open his gifts and have breakfast, they were invited but we were staying home on Christmas Day.  I have never regretted it.", "NTA\n\n\u201cYes family does come first. This year that means my child, and keeping them safe. We will not be exposing them to 50 people within a week because they will still be too young for vaccination. My core family comes first and I am glad you understand that.\u201d\n\nStay firm and keep your baby safe.", "So, I think it's time for your family (You, Hubs, and rainbow baby (congrats!!!!!)) to set your own holiday traditions. Like staying in your own home (if that's what you want) for the day.  This year, you'll have just had a baby. The 4th trimester is real. You need to expect that you and baby will come first in all family decisions for at least a few months after the birth, as you should!", "NTA. I\u2019m a NICU nurse, and I cringe when families are planning a big party to celebrate baby\u2019s discharge. All newborns are vulnerable\u2014that goes double for preemies and newborns with complications. Even if you have a textbook perfect labor/delivery/newborn, influenza/RSV/strep/common colds can be serious for a newborn. Plus, you will be exhausted, immune-compromised, and establishing a routine as well. That many school-aged children and adults with questionable hand hygiene is a hard no. You\u2019re protecting baby and yourself, and that is your main job over the next year. Once you have some shots on board and they\u2019re a little bigger (use your pediatrician for guidance), then let the extended family have their time. This year, you have every right and reason to sit out.", "NTA. As far as I'm concerned, any parents of a child under the age of 8mos don't have to do anything other than keep baby alive and help the mother continue healing.", "NTA.  Family comes first.  YOUR family.  You, hubby and new baby.  The rest are EXTENDED family and can wait till the baby is able to resist some of those germs.  Parents wishes come first.  Safety of the baby comes first.

Good luck and congratulations! \u2764\ufe0f", "Honestly, I\u2019ve only read the question and I\u2019m already voting NTA. I had kids specifically to avoid things I don\u2019t want to go to. \n\nHaving now read the post, you\u2019d be letting your baby down big time if you took her there. I\u2019d awkwardly refuse a hundred invitations before I\u2019d willingly take my newborn around people with crap hygiene and illness etiquette. \n\nMy daughter ended up in hospital for four nights thanks to a little cough she picked up from her brother. Just a cough. They tested for covid, flu, RSV, all sorts of serious conditions and they all came back negative, it was just a cough, but she was nine days old, so she spent half a week in hospital needing oxygen to help her breathe.

You don't have to justify yourselves. \n\nThey don't want to understand, they want their own way. Tough sh!t.", "NTA\n\nIs it possible for you to host one of the events at your own place. Feels like it might resolve the issue?", "NTA - it\u2019s your baby and your time. But you see posts like these a lot and new parents do tend to get a teeny bit over protective. Just remember, you\u2019re not the first people to have a baby, or have a new baby around the holidays. Of course various family will be bummed they won\u2019t get to see you and the new baby but maybe find ways to see limited members or things on a smaller scale. \n\nBut of course, do what feels right for you, your husband, and your baby.", "NTA\nYou will have a VERY young baby. Its 100% reasonable not to go to get togethers.\n\nDon't grab a plate of food and go tho. That IS rude. \nYou either accept or reject an invitation, you do not show up grab food and leave.", "Great chance for you and your husband to establish healthy boundaries with family. You're doing GREAT! Now that you've said you aren't coming and explained why, no need to say more. Trying to explain or convince them just invites an argument. You two are doing what's best for yourselves and for baby, you have each other's backs, that's all that matters. In-laws can learn to accept it not, their choice, but your decision doesn't depend on that. All the best to you!!", "While I totally understand. I\u2019m wondering about a compromise. Where maybe thanksgiving you do 1 or 2, probably moms since it\u2019s the smallest. And Christmas you do the other 1 or 2. \nMake sure you invite the grandparents to meet baby before that. And don\u2019t make promises.  Don\u2019t say that you won\u2019t be there. Just say \u201cwe aren\u2019t sure how we will be feeling or what will happen. We will do our best to be there.\u201d  It\u2019s about what they want to hear. And by \u201cdoing your best\u201d it might mean stopping by for 5 minutes to say hi.
